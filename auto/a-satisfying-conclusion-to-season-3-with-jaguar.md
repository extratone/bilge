# A Satisfying Conclusion to Season 3 with Jaguar

![Jaguar Racing | 2019/20 FIA Gran Turismo Championship // Manufacturer Series - Season 3](https://i.snap.as/FyeSnHX.jpg)
For my first "serious" competitive season in Gran Turismo Sport's [FIA-endorsed Manufacturer's Series](https://www.gran-turismo.com/us/gtsport/sportmode/championship/2089), I signed with Jaguar instead of Aston Martin. Though there are plenty of silk cut liveries available for the F-Type Gr.3, I chose to use [**Buckcherry_77's**](https://www.gran-turismo.com/us/gtsport/user/discover/search/carLivery/livery/3862526/1/7287391620803067929). For the Gr.4 F-Type, I used [**SAN_GTCONCEPT's**](https://www.gran-turismo.com/us/gtsport/user/discover/search/carLivery/livery/1226362/1/6999157939185386544).

*Though it looks like I'm celebrating, I didn't end up finishing all that well. I'm actually yelling at Big Ben to Shut The Fuck Up.*

![Leguna Seca's Corkscrew](https://i.snap.as/3DDRlLf.jpg)

*The corkscrew at Leguna Seca has never been an issue for me - it's everything else. I don't like deserts, California, or the circuit's general layout, honestly.*

![Training with Turismo_lester](https://i.snap.as/HT7SqT9.jpg)

*Still, it was cool to have [Turismo-lester](https://www.gran-turismo.com/us/gtsport/user/profile/2758506) join my practice lobby. (This was as close as I ever got to him, unsurprisingly.)*
