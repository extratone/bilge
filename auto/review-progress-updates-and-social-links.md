# Review Progress Updates and Social Links

## I'm working on car reviews again(!) and I'd like to invite you to join me on mastd.racing.

It's now been three years since [Eugen Rochko](https://mastodon.social/@Gargron)'s [Mastodon](https://joinmastodon.org/) gained the [attention](https://www.theverge.com/2017/4/4/15177856/mastodon-social-network-twitter-clone) of the tech world. (I actually [interviewed him for *Extratone*](https://extratone.com/mastodon-eugen-rochko-federated-social-network).) Since the early days of this new, gorgeous, federated social network, [**mastd.racing**](http://mastd.racing/about) has been a home for racing and general automotive enthusiasts. It's still relatively quiet and signup is currently invite only, but I'd love it if you'd join me using [**my invite**](https://mastd.racing/invite/vc8GBJqX). I'm also working on my review of the 2019 Volkswagen Atlas SEL w/4MOTION and will be posting it here before the end of this week.
