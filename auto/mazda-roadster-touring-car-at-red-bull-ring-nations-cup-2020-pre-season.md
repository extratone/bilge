I didn't place all that well in today's Nation's Cup race (the very first.) I doubt I'll be able to participate in tomorrow's first Manufacturer Series race (Gr. 4 cars at Spa,) so I thought I'd record and upload [this go](https://youtu.be/S79HcWp6gAg). Note how I got too eager and bumped a player off course in the very last corner of the last lap. Disappointed with that. Sorry again.
