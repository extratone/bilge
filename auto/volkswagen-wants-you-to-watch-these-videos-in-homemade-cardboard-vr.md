Since signing up for Volkswagen U.S.' "Media Site" a few days ago for the sake of my [**VW Atlas Review**](https://dieselgoth.com/2019-volkswagen-atlas-sel-vr6-review), I've been treated to a few exquisite emails including this [**press release**](https://media.vw.com/releases/1297) at 8AM today, which details how to make "virtual reality" googles using:

> 1. [VR headset cardboard template](https://www.petersen.org/s/google-cardboard-template.pdf)
> 2. Shoe box or pizza box
> 3. Printer
> 4. Scissors
> 5. Syringe or plastic straw
> 6. Plastic water bottle
> 7. Xacto knife
> 8. Glue gun or epoxy
> 9. Rubber band
> 10. Smartphone

The [template](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/58ade96cf5e2318df30c3469/t/5e973ce792a3407b80107156/1586969832424/google-cardboard-template.pdf) is actually by way of [Google Cardboard](https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/6/20952495/google-cardboard-open-source-phone-based-vr-daydream), which tech media declared "[officially over](https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/16/20915791/google-daydream-samsung-oculus-gear-vr-mobile-vr-platforms-dead)" in the Fall of last year. "Watch the VW ID.3 get built right in front of your eyes!" the release declares. If anyone on Earth actually plans on doing this, *please* [contact me](mailto:davidblue@extratone.com).
