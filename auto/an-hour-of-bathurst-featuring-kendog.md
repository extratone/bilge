In a rare successful attempt at hosting a 60 minute endurance race at Mount Panorama this evening, I ended up having a very satisfying (and sweaty) [battle with Kendog0259](https://youtu.be/cJVtx5NNGCc) in which we traded the lead back and forth in the [last 20 minutes of the race](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/567483365).
