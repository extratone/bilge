## A quick review of Apple, Inc’s first venture as a textile company.

Now that Apple, Incorporated is a textile company, I thought it might be pertinent of me - someone with incredibly filthy hands - to review its first textile product, the Rag. Back in my day, we were taught not to touch the screen. *It’s not good for it*, they’d say. Now, that’s all we do, and it makes me profoundly uncomfortable. I have used a fleet of microfiber cloths (ashamedly sourced from Amazon until recently) to rigorously scrub away the CRUD that results from my disgusting, gorgeous hands touching anything for any duration. I also use Vinegar-based Windex (which is just vinegar,) which has definitely eroded my 12 Pro Max’s [Oleophobic coating](https://discussions.apple.com/thread/251502745) away entirely. It smells wonderful, though.

What’s brought me great grief since the Apple Rag’s debut, notably, have been the discussions I’ve heard on Apple-adjacent podcasts like [*Connected*](https://www.relay.fm/connected)[^1] post-release of the Rag, detailing just how *sparsely* Touchscreen Pros like Federico Viticci actually clean their Pro Screens. Less than once per week, if I recall correctly. I asked this question [in the *MacStories* Discord](https://discord.com/channels/836622115435184162/836622115880828961/947175164800565248) to only a single response:

> Never, really. Sometimes with the side of my hand, but that's only when I really notice the screen being dirty.

I’m assuming silence from the rest of the crowed indicates embarrassment. I clean my 12 Pro Max’s screen once every two hours, bare minimum.

## Methodology

I must admit - it took me a bit to understand the correct methodology for the Apple Rag. At first, I was trying to use the Rag like I’ve used other microfiber cloths, but it’s uniquely suited to flat rubbing upon mostly already cleaned glass screens, which makes sense, I suppose. Unlike regular microfiber cloths, its surface does not lend well to liquid cleaning solutions or scrubbing non-glass surfaces. Nor does it to cleaning *truly* grubby surfaces. As far as I know, it’s not washable - I probably shouldn’t have thrown the packaging away, but I didn’t expect to review it.

I would advise a strong, rotational approach under moderate pressure when using the Rag on your device’s screen. I would not advise you use it on your face or hands. I also would not advise you use it to clean your dog’s paws after a muddy bout. More reasonably, it’s not even all that great for cleaning glasses lenses. (It might just be that mine are particularly dirty.)

## Conclusion

It sounds a bit silly, but $20 is actually a ridiculous amount of money to spend on a single microfiber cloth. I’d link you alternatives, but I’m committed to never sharing Amazon links on this here blog. For what it’s worth, the Apple Rag appears to have a strong resistance to liquids (they just fall off,) and a truly unique competency at cleaning glass screens.
