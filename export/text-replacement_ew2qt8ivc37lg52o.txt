## Declare a Personalized Vocabulary across Apple‚Äôs OSs with Text Replacement.

<!--more-->

If you‚Äôre like me, your cumulative experience of typing on iPhones for more than a decade is probably saturated with needlessly disruptive, unsolicited, and inaccurate autocorrection. Certain proper nouns and a dozen or so quasi-localized dialectal terms in our day-to-day writing/speech have been treated by the system's autocorrect as foreign objects, regardless of how frequently we use them. Technically, this isn't supposed to happen, but - if you've got the patience and the time - there's a native feature across iOS, iPadOS, and macOS that allows you to declare your own user dictionary called [Text Replacement](https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/use-text-replacements-iph6d01d862/ios).

You can find the Text Replacement menu on iOS - as pictured in the screenshot embedded above - by navigating to `General ‚á® Keyboard ‚á® Text Replacement` or (maybe) by tapping [this link](prefs:root=General&path=Keyboard/USER_DICTIONARY). If you think you might use it often, I'd suggest installing [**this Siri Shortcut**](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/e6d56b3fe8bc40639a60f166315f255b) I created that navigates directly to the Text Replacement menu. To be honest, I‚Äôve no idea what you‚Äôll find there if you‚Äôve never created a single entry and - since there‚Äôs no way to import or export from the menu - I‚Äôm not willing to delete all of mine to find out.

Tap the plus (+) symbol in the upper right hand corner of this menu and you should find yourself on a screen identical to the one shown in the screenshot embedded above, with two text entry fields labeled `Phrase` and `Shortcut`. To simply define a phrase - like ‚ÄúExtratone,‚Äù for instance, we needn‚Äôt actually use the latter, though I almost always do. I *would* suggest making two entries for those terms that aren‚Äôt always lowercase/uppercase - `Extratone` and `extratone`.

My suggestion: you needn‚Äôt waste too much time sitting and noodling over potential entries. Instead, try to notice the next time you encounter a frustrating misapplication of autocorrect. Add the Siri Shortcut I shared above to your homescreen so that you can quickly access the menu in this situation. Adding a single word shouldn‚Äôt take you more than a few seconds, this way.

Here‚Äôs [the result](https://gist.github.com/extratone/3c7788e41d32958a04a2ab693fe0512c) of my continuing this practice for the past few years:

## Text Expansion

The goal of this guide was to help those experiencing repeated incorrect autocorrect actions, but Text Replacement‚Äôs explicit purpose is also worth consideration. Similar in function to a favorite third-party app of mine called [Text Expander](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/textexpander-keyboard/id1075927186), you can also use Text Replacement to create text shortcuts to lengthy/tedious/otherwise difficult to replicate text strings. This includes emojis! As you‚Äôll note in the Gist embedded above, my typing out moyai with replace the text ‚Äúmoyai‚Äù with ‚Äúüóø.‚Äù In order to escape the shortcut and simply print the word ‚Äúmoyai,‚Äù all I need to do is tap the `esc` key on my keyboard or the `x` in the upper right hand corner of the autocorrect object. See this demonstrated in [my video guide](https://youtu.be/4Pu4VCiApMU) and/or [the GIF embedded below](https://imgur.com/gallery/K3EWBqh):

What I forgot to mention in the video is that the Text Replacement dictionary is persistent by default across iOS, iPadOS, and macOS via iCloud. You‚Äôll find the menu in the last one at `System Preferences ‚á® Keyboard ‚á® Text`.

From here, you can actually Select All and drag the contents of the text menu to Finder, which will result in a file entitled `Text Substitutions.plist.` Technically, this *does* allow one to back up their Text Replacement configuration, although actually *restoring* said backup would have to be done by hand, term by term.
