# Keeps

![Summer Coldfront](https://i.snap.as/6lyheLL.jpeg)
relentless, the country keeps
doors and walls reverberate
all but rest in summer’s heat

I remember the dawn and dusk - the open palette, gradiented above
opposite a front
overtaking me, 
on the 4030,
tilling terraces ’round the North 180

growing here is not a war with Earth,
but a chronological board game, 
won by the punctual
and patient

I am neither of these,
but I am fond of a good emergency

and it all plays out for me; 
the torrent released in Missouri haste
big drops turn to steam on the labored muffler 
too much to do;
getting it over with,
God cries in heaves, quickly,
around here
