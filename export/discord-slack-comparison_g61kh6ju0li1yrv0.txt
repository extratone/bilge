# Discord is Better Than Slack

## Why Extratone has used Discord instead of Slack for our team chat.

<!--more-->

Back in 2015, I hosted a pre-*Extratone* culture podcast called [*Drycast*](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2zjkrB28csR68YoY1M1eSk) with musician friends from all over the net. To record remotely, we originally used Teamspeak 3 - a gamer VoIP staple. When I discovered Discord, I thought we'd found podcasting heaven. Originally, the free plan included 128kbps audio in its voice channels, which was nearly twice what we were getting out of our *paid* Teamspeak server. If I were still podcasting, Discord's [just-released server video feature](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360041721052-Server-Video) would undoubtedly prove invaluable for live streams.

According to [a poll I ran on Twitter](https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/1261334179352100865?s=20), 2/3rds of all people on Earth are thankful for Discord's existence. This is not surprising considering what every Discord user is still offered without spending any money at all: community spaces with audio/video and text chat capability, organizable by Twitch and YouTube-integrated roles with a plethora of different permission options, instantly and easily shareable by customizable temporary or permanent invite links through an application that's about as cross-platform as one can get (Windows, Mac, Linux, Android, iOS, or simply one's web browser.) Those of us that remember [IRC](https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/1244758973867229185), Ventrilo, and Teamspeak should all consider Discord a tremendous gift.

Never before have so many VoIP, video, and text chat features been offered together, or in such a beautiful package. "What we really did was create an all-in-one voice, video, and text chat app that replaced this constellation of tools that people would use," said CEO Jason Citron in [an interview with CNBC](https://youtu.be/NNJ2n6XKmmA). Technically in terms of these details, Discord *has no competition*. Slack offers text and voice chat with its paid plans, yes, but nothing close in terms of video - especially considering [Discord Go Live](https://www.polygon.com/2019/8/9/20798559/discord-go-live-private-stream-voice-channel), its fairly-new streaming feature, which allows users to stream game video directly to 10 other users in the server. With some jury-rigging, it's possible to simply screen share this way, which is an essential sell for business video communication applications like Skype.

"Discord and Slack have many similarities, but Discord is the superior tool," says [esports team Ardent United](https://medium.com/ardentunited/why-we-use-discord-and-not-slack-500ac8027824). "Discord has voice channels, which allows us to easily chat with our supporters and other team members. Discord also allows us to set user roles and permissions which makes moderation extremely simple." It's not just gaming companies, though. Decentralized cloud platform Sia also [moved their community](https://blog.sia.tech/sia-is-moving-from-slack-to-discord-195f87feb6a6) to Discord:

> Its intended audience is gamers, but many large communities have switched from Slack to Discord, including development communities like [Reactiflux](https://facebook.github.io/react/blog/2015/10/19/reactiflux-is-moving-to-discord.html) and [Unreal Slackers](https://medium.com/@polymoon/unreal-slackers-is-moving-to-discord-c93492eb0612). It includes an unlimited number of users, unlimited file uploads (with a per-file size limit), unlimited message histories, and really great moderation and spam filtering features.

Slack is [often praised](https://www.pcmag.com/reviews/slack) for its integrations, but it shares support with [Zapier](https://zapier.com/blog/slack-vs-discord/) - a dedicated web integration service which more or less integrates them equally.

> Slack works with [a long list of tools](https://slack.com/integrations), including Google Calendar, Zendesk, Salesforce, Wunderlist, and dozens of others. If you're looking for an integration that isn't immediately obvious, you can always turn to Zapier for help, because Slack is a supported service. Zapier is an online service that creates integrations between other apps and services, without you having to know any code to make it happen.

For sharing detailed post embeds, there's also [Discohook](https://discohook.org/), which I just discovered. Productivity company Chanty's blog wrote perhaps [the most in-depth comparison](https://www.chanty.com/blog/discord-vs-slack) of the two services (emphasis theirs):

> At their core, Discord and Slack and very similar. Both are **team chat apps** with a similar interface. Both apps have **team communication organized** in channels. The biggest difference between the two is their **target audience**, and of course, their **specific features**.

Ultimately, one must decide how relevant the services' respective target audiences are to productivity. For a not-for-profit media organization like *Extratone*, Discord's features-for-price ratio is simply too rich to pass up.
