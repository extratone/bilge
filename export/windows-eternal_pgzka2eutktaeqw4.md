## I believe I have finally manifested the Drafts interpretation of Winders users’ dreams.

If you still follow me [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/NeoYokel), you’ve seen me posting a lot of mockups and links related to Agile Tortoise’s [Drafts](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/drafts/id1435957248), lately. I know it probably seems like a phase - and I suppose it is, technically - but I’ve actually been using this darned application for the entirety of my adult life. It’s just that I’ve only recently (read: since 2020 or so) returned to Drafts as my primary text living space from Bear for what I’m sure you’ll regard as [silly reasons](https://beta.bear.app/t/the-line-width-slider-any-chance-i-ll-see-it-again/1945/8). In terms of themes for Drafts, I’ve already hit you with [one based on this very blog](https://actions.getdrafts.com/t/1km) and “[Windows Iowa](https://actions.getdrafts.com/t/1kY)” - both of which have faired far better than I would’ve ever expected on [the Drafts Directory](https://actions.getdrafts.com/theme_definitions?order=popular).

Now, though, I would like to present “[**Windows Eternal**](https://actions.getdrafts.com/t/1wT)” - a celebratory theme of ye olde Winders™ Aesthetic, based on one of my very favorite themes for Telegram Messenger for iOS.

## Telegram Theme

I’m actually not sure what it was called originally, but I’ve archived the Telegram theme as [Windows Eternal](https://t.me/addtheme/windowseternal), too.

If you or someone you know might remember who the original creator was, please do [get in touch](https://davidblue.wtf/db.vcf) because they absolutely deserve to be credited here and elsewhere.

## Details

If you’re interested, [the full source of Windows Eternal](https://github.com/extratone/drafts/blob/main/Themes/Windows%20Eternal.json) is publicly available, though I would recommend using the “Open in Theme Builder” button on its [Drafts Directory page](https://actions.getdrafts.com/t/1wT) to view the details visually, especially if you’re a Drafts user who’s never tried it. You’ll note that I made heavy use of `#327c7d` (that darkish green color) as often as possible along with `#bfc0c1` (the main gray) and `#000DA6` (the main bright blue.)
