## A highly-informed analysis.

He named his dog Number One. His eyebag game disastrous. The Romulans are in a Borg Cube. They’re flirting in The Cube. It’s a Sex Cube. Its shields are very loud, now. They’re smoking weed on Weed Road. There is simply not enough runtime for a truly episodic television show anymore, is there? A Borg Romulan Scott. (Imagine Borg snot.) *The shear fucking hubris*. There’s the F word again. *I didn’t know Romulans could be so hot*. Jesus Christ. “I never really cared for science fiction – I just didn’t *get* it,” says Picard. Very funny, folks.

Did he drop something or...? *Paradigmatic*. CBS’ closed captions are janky and I’m getting older by the second. They are in the Sex Cube again. The Star Trek OS looks like it has annoying notifications. A son? Using the term *Quest*. This is segregation. The *Nightingale* was a [slave ship](http://www.bruzelius.info/Nautica/Ships/Clippers/Nightingale%281851%29.html). This is not lost on me. Spanish speaking! Nothing about operating these ships is visceral at all. Hey! Jeri Ryan! These CBS All Access ads are absolutely bizarre. Icheb is here!? Jesus what a coincidence. Oh.

TECHNO FUTURE. That head tilt was sudden. Romulans are freaking out in English, for some reason. Colonel Jane - Sterling’s young wife - is still a bitch. What a surprise. I still haven’t gotten tired of the introductory credits’ theme. *Pissant*, really? “And now the windmills have turned out to be giants.” I have no idea what that’s referencing. Admirals should not say *shut the fuck up*. The holograms are just different levels of Scottish according to their class. Did they do this just to make sure Scots continued to be represented in *Star Trek*? Why does Rios have so many pips? What rank would he be if he put all of them on? God? **ALISON PILL**. Dr. Pill.

Coordinated bonk. “We’re at a threshold” is not political at all. If I was watching this show by the week, I would be very frustrated by its pace. Very sad about the Orchid deaths. They were cute. They mentioned the Picard Maneuver correctly. Jonathan Frakes directed this. Seven of Nine just said “same,” but we will forgive Brent Spiner for aging and - I hope - for [dying](https://www.digitalspy.com/tv/ustv/a31959862/star-trek-picard-brent-spiner-finished-playing-data/). 

I think we probably should’ve let ourselves let Picard die.
