# I Bought a Desktop

## I bought a desktop tower for the first time since 2010 and spent an embarrassingly long time struggling with Bluetooth shit.

<!--more-->

As with my [entire history](https://bilge.world/hp-spectre-x360-review) of computer purchases, my acquisition of an [HP ENVY Desktop tower](https://support.hp.com/us-en/document/c06443577), today, was last-minute, ill-informed, and certainly irrational. You "PC master race" folk: please spare me the _dude, you could've just built your own pc so much cheaper_ shit.[^1] Yes, I realize the sensible course of action would've begun with a two hour trip West to the closest Microcenter, where I'm sure the staff would've made PC shopping an absolute blast and I would've come away with a more powerful, much cheaper machine. However, after I managed to [break Windows](https://www.davidblue.wtf/finally-broke-windows/) on my only machine this weekend (and subsequently failed to reset it,) I was getting especially behind on schoolwork and had _absolutely no desire_ to complete any of it on my iPhone.

And so... I've just returned from picking up said HP Tower along with a [27" HP LED display](https://store.hp.com/us/en/pdp/hp-27f-27-inch-display#!), and am writing you after having set up the machine physically and installed most of my "essential software" list (at least all that I could remember.) As per my favorite tradition of new computer acquisition, I have named the machine after [Hildur Odegard](https://fortitude.fandom.com/wiki/Hildur_Odegard) from _Fortitude_.

## "First Impressions"

It's been exactly 10 years since I last bought a desktop tower - since I first set hands on the Dell XPS Studio desktop with which I would create the majority of my intellectual property - and I was immediately surprised by how much smaller (6.12 x 11.93 x 13.28 inches) and lighter (13.12 lbs.) this tower was than my expectations. The display, too, is remarkably light and thin. Rationally, I should not have been surprised by this, but I'm not going to punish myself for continuing to find any sort of magic in technology.

In the box were a Bluetooth keyboard - specifically, an HP model [4251a-khsap003k](https://fccid.io/EMJKHSA-P003K) - and mouse set, the latter of which I will hopefully never have to use, thanks to my [Logitech G203](https://youtu.be/oIAY1-aW8Es) - and was perplexed by the process of how to pair the former with the tower while it was in setup mode for far too long. I was just about to give up entirely when I revisited the packaging and noticed what I'd previously assumed was an anti-theft device, but was actually the fucking dongle for the pair. I continue to despise Bluetooth peripherals, obviously, but the multimedia function keys of the product led to some important realizations: I now had reason to use Windows Desktop Switching _and_ have a calculator application again! However, I have yet to figure out how to alter the Function key's behavior (I'm not even sure it's possible:) in order to input **Alt+F4**, I have to input **Fn+Alt+F4**, which is far too clunky to depend on. The issue did lead to a revelation which I may or may not integrate permanently: I mapped **Alt+F4** to the previously-unused button on the very top of the G203. So far, it's been pretty nifty.

That said, a component of my intention to create an intentional, static, upright-sitting desktop workspace included an allotment for a quality mechanical keyboard - my justification was that any professional in a particular craft makes a point to have the best possible tools for the job, so a high-quality keyboard has actually been _very_ long overdue, in my case. So, I sought out [a single _Wirecutter_ recommendations list](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/our-favorite-mechanical-keyboards/) and even attempted to disseminate [r/MechanicalKeyboards](https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/).[^2] After a brief jaunt, I concluded that no reasonable person would be able to make heads or tails of the forum or [its seemingly endless wikis](https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/wiki/index) without considerable indoctrination so I more or less threw a dart and landed on the [Varmilo VA108M](https://mechanicalkeyboards.com/shop/index.php?l=product_detail&p=3504), which I ordered. All I know is that it's fairly highly-reviewed on the marketplaces I checked (though hardly mentioned on the subreddit, actually,) and that it has the _Cherry Switches_, which are... [The good ones](https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/comments/d3hmw3/my_new_baby_varmilo_108m_cherry_mx_blues_the/).

A concern I originally had with taking over the tertiary guest room - by far the smallest allotted living space in the house - as my office was its distance from our wireless router, two floors down. The last time I used the room as a workspace (five years ago,) my old tower's integrated WiFi card often struggled to maintain a reliable connection. The adapter included in this desktop, though, actually managed to clock [the fastest download speed on my SpeedTest.net records](https://www.speedtest.net/result/10021332678) just now.

Somehow, I just managed to clock the [highest download speed on my record](https://www.speedtest.net/result/10021332678) from two floors up!

## Bad(ish)

It's almost painful even to write this but... As beautiful as this $250 display is to behold, I've grown accustomed to my [Surface Laptop 2](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/surface/business/surface-laptop-2)'s **2256 x 1504 13"** display after years of hard, daily use. Apparently, those dimensions mean the little machine's display has a pixel density of **201 Pixels-Per-Inch**. Filling a **27"** display with just **1920 x 1080** means a pixel density of just **81.6 Pixels-Per-Inch**,[^3] and the disparity was glaring to my eyes, even from the setup screen. After a few hours of regular use, I'm not sure I notice it anymore, but I suspect I will again when I've got the laptop running again. Please do indicate whether or not you think such a complaint makes me awful in the [Crowdsignal poll](https://poll.fm/10603399) below.

I've also already had trouble connecting my [Bose SoundLink headphones](https://www.bose.com/en_us/support/products/bose_headphones_support/bose_around_ear_headphones_support/soundlink-around-ear-wireless-headphones-ii.html) correctly via Bluetooth. On my Surface Laptop, it registered as two separate devices - "Stereo Headphones" and "Headset" - which allowed me to use them as both the primary audio output _and_ the primary audio input. For whatever reason, I have been unable to accomplish such a simultaneous connection on this machine: I can either connect them as headphones or as a headset, but not both. [This video](https://youtu.be/55yn-zF_dZY) provided some help - I know now that I have to open Sound Settings and manually connect the headphones every time I re-connect them. Hopefully, I'll figure out another solution soon.

Returning to the webcam issue: I discovered that absolutely _zero_ local stores keep add-on webcams in stock anymore, which makes sense. I resorted to searching Amazon for webcams and found a gargantuan list of brands I had never heard of. When I filtered by the one I _did_ recognize - Logitech - I saw barely-facelifted versions of the camera my stepdad bought in 2008 and none were in stock. Unwilling to further investigate or research more, I set the price filter for under $40, sorted by customer ratings, and bought the first product which had even remotely legitimate-looking reviews: [this 1080p _thing_](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08BQZT4N8/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) branded with "Mersuii."

After returning to the order invoice hours later for this post, I got curious enough to Google search the company name and discovered a dead-end url, zero Wikipedia page, and [this Trademark registration](https://trademarks.justia.com/863/53/mersuii-86353116.html), on which I spotted some very interesting information. Entered in the second "Goods & Services" row is the following text:

To hell with that keyboard! Now I am immensely curious as to what I'll be receiving in the mail this coming **Monday**, the **7th**.
