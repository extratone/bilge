Yes, I bought a mechanical keyboard. It occurred to me that folks who spend a lot of time doing things that require tools - _professionals_, artisans, craftsmen, etc. - usually seek out the best possible quality offerings of those tools. Even if they're just 5% better than the average alternatives and cost twice as much, when one uses them for hours every day, the last bit of refinement pays off very quickly. Considering how much typing I've done in the past 5-10 years, I find it a bit silly that I hadn't before thought to optimize the hardware I've used to do so. Now that I've put at least some thought into designing the space in which I work and [gone back to school](https://www.davidblue.wtf/college-return/), I've also invested in bettering the thing my hands actually touch the most.

##### Actually... Before I go on, [here is the link](https://documentcloud.adobe.com/link/review?uri=urn:aaid:scds:US:497d6e70-60df-4087-a3e5-af91077bec15https://documentcloud.adobe.com/link/review?uri=urn:aaid:scds:US:497d6e70-60df-4087-a3e5-af91077bec15) to the Varmilo VA108M User Manual/Guide/Reference in English in case that's what you came looking for. (I had difficulty finding it, too.)

I suppose I've let myself be blinded to the advantages of a mechanical keyboard by the _gaemer_ stigma that surrounds them. This time, I believe I began by simply inputting something like "best keyboard for typing" into a search engine, which returns plenty of iffy results, naturally, but among them was [a list from _Wirecutter_](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/our-favorite-mechanical-keyboards/) - whom I trust, more or less - of "Best Mechanical Keyboards 2020." Also included were posts in the [r/MechanicalKeyboards subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/), which I _actually fucking joined_[^1] (but promise never to mention again outside of this post.) Uncovering my eyes, I found a ridiculously-extensive community message board and [Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/wiki), which is undoubtedly the most extensive resource on the subject to be found, anywhere. Though I did place a time limit on myself for any research of 15 minutes, in retrospect, I suppose I also had some criteria, which I assume - if you're still reading - you might be interested in:

- **WIRED** as fuck. Bluetooth can _fuck off_.
- "Full" keyboard, for the same reason I'd never spend any money on a piano with any less than 88 keys.
- At least tolerably tasteful, aesthetically. (Not overwhelmingly embarrassing if someone were to actually see me using it.)
- Cute, ideally.
- No light shows.
- Not "ergonomic."
- Not from Logitech or Microsoft.

Immediately, it was overwhelmingly clear that my choice must also have _The Cherry_... The Cherries... The "Cherry MX Switches," whatever they are. _Any_ of even the most skimmy reading up on the subject will lead you to this conclusion. That addressed, I arrived upon three considerations: the [Ducky One 2](https://www.duckychannel.com.tw/en/Ducky-One2-RGB-TKL), [Das Keyboard Model S Professional](https://www.daskeyboard.com/model-s-professional/), and [Varmilo VA87M](http://blog.piaw.net/2017/12/review-varmilo-va87m-wired-keyboard.html).

As good as the idea of something as German as the Das Keyboard sounded, I hate the way it looks, and the Ducky seemed to take itself too seriously (despite its brand name.) The VA87M seemed to be ideal if it was full-sized. I searched for the equivalent, [found the VA108M](http://mechanicalkeyboards.com/shop/index.php?l=product_detail&p=2855), and bought one immediately. Specifically...

| **SKU**         | [VA108MP2W/LLK22W](http://mechanicalkeyboards.com/shop/index.php?l=product_detail&p=2855) |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Switches**    | Cherry MX Silent Red[^2]                                     |
| **Dimensions**  | 5.39″ x 17.41″ x 1.30″                                       |
| **Cord Length** | 60 Inches                                                    |

I've already written more than I ever wanted to, but let me just say that I love everything about the thing - the particular set of special keys, the way it feels & sounds, and that its heft prevents it from moving around - and I hope to keep it forever. As I said on the photographs I posted to social media, **I promise to never bring this or any other mechanical keyboard up ever again** unless asked about it.

[1] Yes, I have actually been using the Read It website in the past 18 months or so, which anyone who’s known me at all would find unbelievable. I don’t know if I’ll write about it in the future, so I’ll just say I’ve unblocked it within my psyche largely because it’s no longer horrendous to look at.

[2] I remain genuinely confused as to why the color of the switches matters, considering they are only visible when the keycaps have been removed.
