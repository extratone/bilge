# Liberating UNIIQU3‘s “TECHNO IS BLACK” Playlist from Spotify

By the end of next year, I no doubt will be a card-carrying festival bro. If you need explanation for why I’ve been listening to *Resident Advisor*’s main podcast feed with relative frequency, that’s it.

I’d been catching up this afternoon when I came across [**the big round number 800**](http://ra.co/podcast/800) and found it immediately so compelling that I actually *sought out the associated interview*, which I needed only skim for less than half a second a before spotting the words “Techno Is Black.” (Stylistically, I believe the *Advisor* is in error here. TECHNO IS BLACK doesn’t seem to be in question.)

Within the same second, I’m sure, I saw the words “Spotify playlist” in the vicinity of this profound, but unacceptably undercovered truth, and concluded that I was obligated to take action.

Using a free web tool to associate some metadata across databases is not activism, mind you, but here’s what I can do: I will be diligently minding the origin playlist (on Spotify) for changes and assuring that they are reflected accurately in the target playlist (on Apple Music.) I will *not* be removing any music. I can do this, at the very least. 

I have also created handy shortlinks for both the original and the parallel playlist hosted on my Apple Music profile.
