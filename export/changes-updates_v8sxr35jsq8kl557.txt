## New look, more posts

I've been devoting significant attention to this blog recently, and I hope it shows. [**Reading**](https://bilge.world/reading) now contains a list of recommended email newsletters as well as an ongoing list of my all-time favorite reads on The Web. I also added [**Podcast**](https://bilge.world/podcast) for *End User* and a dedicated [**Subscribe**](https://bilge.world/subscribe) page. I've added [**Open**](https://bilge.world/open) - a list of some of my favorite Open Web projects and [**Social**](https://bilge.world/social) - a list of my social links. [**About**](https://bilge.world/about) has also been updated with new branding and more current hyperlinks. Typography and colors have been unified and updated to [Version 2.3](https://bilge.world/colophon), and [**my theme has been officially listed**](https://write.as/themes/bilge) for those of you willing to engage in the sincerest form of flattery. Also, look at that favicon! Thank you, [CJ](https://blog.cjeller.site/)!

Furthermore, I took the time to import some old work:

"[**Bandcamp: Streaming's Secret Savior**](https://bilge.world/bandcamp-streaming-music)"
A magnum opus of a 13,000+ word essay on why Bandcamp should be the future of music streaming services.

"[**Mark Fuck and the Goofy Godheads**](https://bilge.world/mark-zuckerberg)"
An old, hilarious rant about Mark Zuckerberg and Elon Musk that - if I may say so - still rings awfully true today.

"[**The Matchsellers' Inheritance**](https://bilge.world/the-matchsellers-bluegrastronauts)"
A local bluegrass band releases an album that proves they are not just what they appear to be.

"[**The Case for Chuck Klosterman**](https://bilge.world/chuck-klosterman-x)"
A deep dive into whether or not the voice of one old White Portland Dad should be culturally considered.

"[**Kilgore Trout on CreateSpace**](https://bilge.world/breakfast-of-champions)"
A critique of self-publishing culture (immediately after self-publishing myself) disguised as a review of Kurt Vonnegut's *Breakfast of Champions*.

"[**Virtual Reality Virginity, Lost**](https://bilge.world/virtual-reality-virginity)"
An account of my first experience in VR thanks to my friend [Isiah](https://twitter.com/ammnontet).

"[**Twitter Thrives on Incompetence**](https://bilge.world/twitter-lists)"
Pleading for users to *just use Lists*. *Lists are linear and ad-free*.

"[**Profound Revelations in iOS 12**](https://bilge.world/siri-shortcuts-ios12-review)"
Siri Shortcuts really *meant* something in the beginning.

"[**Illiteracy in American Media**](https://bilge.world/illiteracy-coverage-american-media)"
A short academic essay about how little the illiteracy issue is covered in American media.
