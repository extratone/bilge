# 3AM, Licking

My girlfriend very generously offered to go for a drive with me yesterday evening, though neither of us particularly expected to end up parked at 5:40AM outside a little Diner called Ziggie’s some four hours away from home. I managed to learn a bit about driving apps and briefly flood my Jetta’s intake long enough to stall it after fording some flood water a wee bit too rapidly.

Since I’ve begun working in Kansas City and occasionally commuting from Columbia, I’ve found incentive to revisit the crowdsourced driving directions  mobile app [Waze](https://apple.co/2PJuh5y), which I recall being very excited about in early 2016. It’s smoother now, yet devoid of that pseudocountercultural sense in a design sense. Functionally, it is still *the* most reliable method of police detection I’ve ever encountered - in this Second Era of my Waze usage I have yet to see a single Missouri Highway Parol car sat in the center of I-70 that hadn’t been reported on Waze first - even at crazy hours on weekday mornings - which should be all the reassurance one needs regarding the immediate future of their userbase.

Somehow, I was unaware until this morning that Waze allows you to “share” your route by generating a link to a web app of theirs that will live track your progress. Though I can’t actually imagine too many use cases for this, I still think it’s cool. Anybody who’s interested in stalking my every move should [follow me on Twitter](http://twitter.com/neoyokel) - where I’m sure I’ll be sharing more drives from now on - and/or DM me and just ask me to enable 24/7 location-sharing for ya!

On the topic of mobile apps for those folks like me who’s only real hobby is just fucking driving around, I did actually find mention in a listicle from a *real motoring enthusiast’s publication*. “[Seven Apps That Will Help Improve Your Driving Experience](https://www.roadandtrack.com/car-culture/travel/tips/g6477/seven-best-apps-for-driving-road-assistance/)” is not exactly the sort of advisory article I remember seeing in *Road & Track* considering that it actually only contains one single app even vaguely related to True *Driving Pleasure* called [Greatest Drive](http://www.greatestroad.com/).

> Users contribute their favorite routes and with Yelp integration you can either pick a destination to find the most scenic way to get there or find a good spot to eat along the route you've already chosen.  

Of course, it’s nowhere to be found on the App Store, but it sounded relatively foodist anyway.

## Other notes:

* ***Licking***, Missouri may have a silly name, but [the data says it’s struggling](http://www.city-data.com/city/Licking-Missouri.html). Look for the median household income.
* Apparently the premier mile-tracking app right now is Microsoft’s [MileIQ](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/mileiq-mileage-tracker-log/id578830929?mt=8), which I’m going to continue to try because I can’t resist [automatically-generated PDF reports](https://miqreports.blob.core.windows.net/miles-email/9IPQSm8XEemkb6ISxfkacQ/miles/mobile/monthly/134f21f6-3634-41ab-8196-d1910003f48e/MileIQ__May%2001%202019%20-%20May%2031%202019_6fb774d0-6f34-11e9-9d6a-0a580af40224.pdf?se=2019-06-19T12%3A51%3A01Z&sp=r&sv=2018-03-28&sr=b&sig=HAeULISGzXfAomSVQ41Xm%2BHTNCcAFlwUmFqPY3G/Lc0%3D), ever. 
* I gave my girlfriend administrator roles for my derelict joke Facebook page *[Boiler Explosion Memes](http://facebook.com/boilerexplosionmemes)* and she’s somehow managed to get it to almost 100 likes / +25,000% impressions in just a matter of days!!!!
