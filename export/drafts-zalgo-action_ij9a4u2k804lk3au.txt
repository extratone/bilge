Earlier this afternoon, I put out [an ask on Twitter](https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/1492591057950892040) regarding how to use JavaScript to create a native Drafts Action for Zalgo Text. Delightfully, tagging @draftsapp in that post paid off, for just a bit ago, Greg - Drafts’ sole creator and guardian - [*actually replied*](https://twitter.com/draftsapp/status/1492645727729766400) with a link to [**an action he’d just posted**](https://directory.getdrafts.com/a/1vM) called “Zalgos.”

As I said on Twitter, this is almost certainly the second most thoughtful gift I’ve ever recieved, though I had to share it with you. I’ve also created a shortlink: `bit.ly/ddzalgo`.
