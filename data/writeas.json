If you need explanation for why I’ve been listening to *Resident Advisor*’s main podcast feed with relative frequency, that’s it.\n\nI’d been catching up this afternoon when I came across [**the big round number 800**](http://ra.co/podcast/800) and found it immediately so compelling that I actually *sought out the associated interview*, which I needed only skim for less than half a second a before spotting the words “Techno Is Black.” (Stylistically, I believe the *Advisor* is in error here. TECHNO IS BLACK doesn’t seem to be in question.)\n\nhttps://soundcloud.com/resident-advisor/ra800-uniiqu3\n\nWithin the same second, I’m sure, I saw the words “Spotify playlist” in the vicinity of this profound, but unacceptably undercovered truth, and concluded that I was obligated to take action.\n\nUsing a free web tool to associate some metadata across databases is not activism, mind you, but here’s what I can do: I will be diligently minding the origin playlist (on Spotify) for changes and assuring that they are reflected accurately in the target playlist (on Apple Music.) I will *not* be removing any music. I can do this, at the very least. \n\nI have also created handy shortlinks for both the original and the parallel playlist hosted on my Apple Music profile.\n\n[**ORIGIN**](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/6GXo3G4M0wrOVI7yTkYviz): `https://open.spotify.com/playlist/6GXo3G4M0wrOVI7yTkYviz`\n\n\u003e UNIIQU3'S FAVORITE BLACK TECHNO ARTISTS..

I have my own pubescent stories of Mac occultism, but I do not consider my relationship with the brand to be an essential part of my identity, as so many do and have. Apple, Inc’s story is spectacular and infinitely-relevant so long as they remain “the most valuable company in the history of the world,” as I so love to describe them. Like many of you, I’m sure, I am often compelled to bring up the humongous contrasts in the historical context of the company - to scream infinitely many variations of the observation that Apple was basically the fucking _indie_, premium-tier consumer tech manufacturer owned by the Creative Class for the first half+ of their existence, and have somehow maintained that _Think Different_™ brand narrative as they have definitively become the Big Blue of their time.\n\nFrom my perspective, the responsibility for the wellbeing of this utterly-delusional, occasionally very dangerous sentiment actually lies fairly squarely on those of us who consider ourselves _better than all of that_ because of our Debian workflows and their ancient command line utilities. (For the record, this is also 100% delusional as things stand in 2021.) One thing I think we can all acknowledge, though, is that Apple’s image has been inextricably bound with _musicmaking_, throughout, far more than any other even remotely comparable tech company. Naturally, the business still loves to bring this up all the time in big, glossy gestures. The topical example of note would be the only worthwhile content I’ve yet to encounter on Apple TV+: _[Billie Eilish: The World’s a Little Blurry](https://tv.apple.com/us/movie/billie-eilish-the-worlds-a-little-blurry/umc.cmc.5waz3hfo9r1133t8arap8b6nq)_, which documents the highlights of the young, beloved musician’s prodigious ascension. For what it’s worth, I appreciate some special insights I gained thanks to the film, which I do not actually consider at odds with the truth of its super on-brandness for Apple.\n\nAn interesting take I found from 2017 from a new favorite voice on the _business_ end of tech reporting: “[How Music Drowns Apple’s Innovation](http://thein.fo/8dba9a5022e1d273)” by _The Information_’s Jessica Lessin portrays Apple’s relationship with music distribution and the music industry as a sort of compulsive distraction from its ambitions in serving video content, namely. Lessin points out the everpresent reminders of this obsession:\n\n\u003e And so it is no wonder that Apple’s first forays into original video content fall under Apple Music. It’s worth noting that the first series the company announced—“Carpool Karaoke” is literally about singing; “Planet of the Apps” features rapper Will.i.am as a judge.\n\nI think I can speak for the majority of my audience when I suggest that the targets of Lessin’s cynicism would be more than welcome, if they were The Whole Truth. Indeed, the most valuable company in all of history retaining an “emotional” attachment to the welfare of music creators might be described as _charming_ or more. As is often the case on _The Information_, the comments from readers often offer noteworthy insight. In this case, Kevin Swint - who has apparently worked as an executive for both Apple and Samsung, according to [his profile](https://www.theinformation.com/contributors/458) on _The Information_ - responded with an important consideration: “…it's possible that Apple's behavior around music has more to do with the company's overall tendency to stick with its past successes a bit too long rather than music really being a core part of its DNA.”\n\nIn terms of business, that’s all I have to contribute, and I shall do my best not to evangelize Apple Music (or more likely, disparage Spotify as one of the most destructive cultural forces of our time,) here. However, I would like to respond to a particular Jimmy Iovine quote from the original Apple Music announcement amid the [2015 WWDC Keynote](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/apple-events-video/id275834665?i=1000430692668):\n\n\u003e There needs to be a place where music can be treated less like digital bits and more like the art it is, with a sense of respect and discovery… and if that place could actually accommodate and support the artists who make the music, not just the top-tier artists, but the kids in their bedrooms too, provide them all with a home and a way to engage with their audiences, that would be pretty great.\n\n_Boy, this service Iovine describes sounds an awful lot like Bandcamp, no?_ The suggestion that **Apple should have purchased Bandcamp** is a very scary one, from my perspective, but I am reassured by the likelihood that the notion did indeed occur to someone at Apple, Inc. at some point in the past, and was quickly discarded, for whatever reason. I promise not to mention Bandcamp again in this Post, aside from its own two iOS apps: for [listeners](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/bandcamp/id706408639) and for “[Artists/Labels](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/bandcamp-for-artists-labels/id1185670538)” as creator/curator tools.\n\nI’m going to be focusing largely on the iPhone-bound experience, here, though I did borrow my mom’s MacBook Pro for a weekend to explore the state of music on MacOS and (accidentally) played around with [Apple Music on The Television](https://youtu.be/AazMEzHPN-0) (a surprisingly beautiful experience.) On that note, I’ll hurry up and get specific…\n\n\u003c!--more--\u003e\n\n## Apps\n\nAssuming you’re already an Apple Music user, it’s very possible that you’ve been deprived of the “true” experience on the service provided by the variety of actively-developed but woefully-undercovered app store entries that integrate directly with Apple Music. One of the most glaring discoveries I’ve made so far in my iOS deep dive, this year, has been the absolutely horrific state of Discovery on Apple’s App Store. If you’d thought to search the top charts under the store’s Music category, you wouldn’t find any of the gems I’m going to highlight, here. The credit for exposing me to their existence, in fact, lies with _MacStories_ - a hard-hitting, well-established Apple-adjacent media company piloted by [Federico Viticci](https://twitter.com/viticci). At this very moment, their app-centric podcast, _App Stories_, is in the midst of [a special mini-series](https://appstories.net/episodes/212/) devoted to Music on iOS/Mac, from which this Post draws upon heavily. For better or worse, they represent the definitive authority on this subject (among many others, naturally,) though I wouldn’t necessarily recommend their various publications be added to the reading lists of any but those most invested in iOS.\n\n![MusicHarbor on iPhone](https://i.snap.as/4agfF1nW.png)\n\n### [MusicHarbor](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/musicharbor-track-new-music/id1440405750)\n\nThere is something uniquely concrete about a purely-chronological feed which we’ve lost in the past 5-10 years in favor of algorithmic curation, generally. The [next item](https://bilge.world/tweetbot-6-ios-review) in _this_ particular feed, in fact, includes my attempt to explain why Twitter’s hard-chronological Lists feature has sheltered me from the anxiety of the service’s main timeline, now ordered by proprietary (and obscured) formulas. I’d been aware of that dynamic in my own Twitter consumption for years, though. I certainly did _not_ anticipate the impact of the music release equivalent of a chronological timeline as provided by **[MusicHarbor](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/musicharbor/id1440405750)** - an app for iOS and MacOS that acts as a frontend for one’s music library across both Apple Music and Spotify.\n\nIt's hard to remember how we (Apple Music) got here without embarking upon some gargantuan _A Complete Visual History of Apple Music_-like document, but it must be said that Tim Cook's \"next chapter in music\" has become a sad afterthought. As far as I understand it, the \"streaming war\" between Apple and Spotify has long since gone definitively to the latter in statistical terms, which I'd suggest to be an overall positive outcome for Apple Music subscribers, generally. The self-perception within the heavy music consumer crowd of \"niche,\" \"underground,\" \"obscure\" cultural minority should - in theory - push those who believe themselves _destined to be different_ away from Spotify into the handy care of Apple, the absolute champion of this particular self-deception. To be honest - though I write this for _all_ listeners, sincerely - I have found myself in a sort of utopian echo chamber of my own design in music culture terms. My days of waiting through 4+ hours of local openers before rap shows are far behind me, and I consume and engage exclusively with music I find personally redeemable.\n\nMy Apple Music library has become quite fragmented after I lost my entire physical music collection along with the external drives containing my accumulated digital music library in 2017. Still, after more or less starting anew this past December and casually, deliberately adding digital files back into the accursed, ancient iTunes desktop application and restoring some (outdated) versions of my handful of shared curatorial playlists thanks to SongShift (which we'll glance on later,) MusicHarbor currently lists 1433 artists represented across my Apple Music and (very sparse) Spotify libraries. I know this because of [a very simple Siri Shortcut](https://routinehub.co/shortcut/8935/) I modified which returns a text list of all Artists in one's MusicHarbor library in Quick Look. ([Here is my result](https://gist.github.com/extratone/32763d8d2d6a71ab0fe4e045a6fb4441) as of this moment in GitHub Gist form.) According my App Store receipts, I first downloaded MusicHarbor on March 26 - 20 days ago - which is mentionable because of how much I've accomplished with very minimal time investment in terms of curating my own music library thanks to MusicHarbor. As you'll note in the 3rd of the 4 screenshots embedded above, I was able to delete System of a Down from my library - a single function which alone justifies the app's one-time $5.99 \"Unlock Everything\" fee, to my sensibility. I've also been able to begin following all the artists represented in a few of my favorite playlists with a handful of taps - a task which would literally require hours in the native Apple Music app of old (when one could actually follow artists, there.) On that note, it's time to cite the primary _MacStories_ article you should read, entitled \"[How I Keep Track of New Music Releases](https://www.macstories.net/ios/how-i-keep-track-of-new-music-releases/),\" regarding Apple Music's performance as a release tracker:\n\n\u003e The ‘New Releases’ section is tucked at the very end of the For You page and laid out as a horizontal carousel that requires a lot of swiping; you can view the ‘New Releases’ page as a grid, which has sections for different weeks, but, in my experience, it only aggregates highlights for new releases from some of my favorite artists. The ‘New Music Mix’ playlist is not terrible, but it often comes loaded with stale data – songs I’ve already listened to multiple times and which shouldn’t qualify as “new” weeks after their original release date. Furthermore, I’ve found notifications for new releases for artists in my library unreliable at best: I occasionally get notifications for new albums, but never for new singles or EPs.\n\nHere, Federico Viticci is riffing off [a newsletter issue](https://chorus.fm/features/liner-notes-november-1st-2019/) written by music blogger Jason Tate, in which he describes the service's missing tracking functionality as \"the single most frustrating part of Apple Music.\" Though these points in the conversation are both almost two years old, MusicHarbor remains the ultimate means of tracking new music releases chronologically on Apple's platforms. Though I am personally just three weeks in, the confidence this app has given me in the certainty of its chronological release feed is quite profound. Its integration with one's calendar to track _upcoming_ releases is a bit much for my own needs, but I know personally enough invested curators for whom it'd be a godsend to mark it no small addition.\n\n![MusicHarbor on MacOS](https://i.snap.as/UxLBTYvL.png)\n\nMusicHarbor’s only downside is entirely excusable/understandable, in context: it’s a bit clunky. For the sake of this work, I set up [a shared Apple Music playlist](https://music.apple.com/us/playlist/musicharbor/pl.u-2aoq40vTaR0XmA) so I could further demonstrate all the new music I discovered in MusicHarbor. Adding whole albums to this playlist with a single tap _feels_ powerful because it _is_ - I’ve no idea what sort of developer wizardry is involved in such an action, but the Wait Wheel doesn’t feel like too much to endure. Adding a release to one’s library - the other in-MusicHarbor accumulative function - is a bit quicker. It’s important to remember that this piece of software was/is created and maintained by a single human being, though I would expect nothing but improvement, going forward.\n\n![Adding to MusicHarbor Playlist](https://i.snap.as/yN3nbcdR.png)\n\nThat’s all I have to report on MusicHarbor, for the moment, but I’ll add further _MacStories_ praise from their [2019 MacStories Selects](https://www.macstories.net/stories/macstories-selects-2019-recognizing-the-best-apps-of-the-year/#app-of-the-year-runner-up) app rewards:\n\n\u003e What makes MusicHarbor special – and, ultimately, the reason why we all use the app here at MacStories – is just how much developer Tanaka understands what someone who wants to know about new music releases is looking for.\n\n**July 2021 Update**: The MacStories gentlemen have just published [an interview episode of ](https://appstories.net/episodes/230)_[AppStories](https://appstories.net/episodes/230)_ speaking at length with MusicHabor creator Marcos Tanaka.\n\n![Albums for iOS](https://i.snap.as/KylIYzaI.png)\n\n### [Albums](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/albums-album-focused-player/id1469948986)\n\nOn the other end of the spectrum, exploring new digital manifestations of _The Music Collection_, is [Albums](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/albums-album-focused-player/id1469948986), which actually functions as an entire replacement frontend player for Apple Music. Reviewed [much more recently by ](https://www.macstories.net/reviews/albums-4-0-a-must-have-app-for-music-lovers/)_[MacStories](https://www.macstories.net/reviews/albums-4-0-a-must-have-app-for-music-lovers/)_, it really is best-described as “opinionated, favoring album playback over individual songs or playlists.” Considering that I installed the app just a week ago and have focused most of my attention on MusicHarbor in that time, I’ll leave most of the commentary to John Voorhees. All I can say, really, is that I see an extremely powerful application, here, for a fairly specific use case: someone who’s listening is largely occupied by albums they already “own” in Apple Music and treasure deeply. The ability to set an individual record’s “Immersive UI Tint” down to the hex (in “Album Settings”) is as in-depth a tool of adoration as I’ve ever seen in a digital music service. Combined with Albums’ presumptuous takeover of actual playback from the Apple Music app, I think I can rightfully say that it was built for the _extremely serious_ music consumer.\n\nMy favorite part so far: the app knew well enough to offer me THE ZRO BUTTON. Telling, I think.\n\n![The ZRo Button - Albums App](https://i.snap.as/9pNf178x.jpeg)\n\n### Others\n\nSince it’s already quite clear how much this Post draws from _MacStories_, I’ll let [their review of Soor](https://www.macstories.net/reviews/soor-2-review-magic-mixes-and-release-alerts-elevate-the-beautiful-apple-music-client/) stand on its own (I couldn’t quite justify spending $6.99 just for review purposes.) In the episode embedded above, they also mention [Denim](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/denim-playlist-cover-maker/id1532250420) - a playlist cover creator I am not personally all that impressed with. There’s also MusicHarbor’s sibling, [MusicSmart](https://www.macstories.net/reviews/musicsmart-puts-the-spotlight-on-music-credits/), which manages the tricky but essential task of adding the metadata retrieval Apple Music should have included all along. The rest can be found in [the episode’s show notes](https://appstories.net/episodes/213/). I’m not done with them, but the rest are what I would differentiate as _services_…\n\n## Services\n\n\u003c!--more--\u003e\n\n### [Odesli/Song.Link](https://song.link/ivyhollivana)\n\nOne of the bewilderingly undercovered digital music sharing tools of our kind, Odesli has been [my preferred method](https://twitter.com/search?q=song.link%2C%20%40neoyokel\u0026f=live) of sharing tracks/albums/EPs since I first discovered it in 2018. It is _not_ specific to iOS but it _is_ **essential** for competent music sharing, anywhere, these days, in its magical ability to _correctly_ intersect any given piece of music’s links across all streaming services, known and unknown. To be honest, I thought everybody would be using it by now, but it’s continued to develop with [minimal attention](https://twitter.com/odesli_/status/1383100269320409095) aside from [Siri Shortcuts developers](https://www.notion.so/iOS-Shortcuts-0efaf0ef92c0467aa6fc201b78c8499e). Thanks to [Odesli’s Public API](https://www.notion.so/Public-API-d8093b1bb8874f8b85527d985c4f9e68), dozens of Music-centric Siri Shortcuts have emerged over the past few years, resulting in one of the most useful Siri Shortcuts integrations to be found for real, reasonable human beings. Here’s where Apple-adjacent media and I part ways…\n\nWhile current common conversation might point you to Federico Viticci’s [MusicBot hyper-Shortcut](https://www.macstories.net/ios/introducing-musicbot-the-all-in-one-apple-music-assistant-powered-by-shortcuts/) and/or @gianflo6’s 600 action-strong [Song.Link Shortcut](https://routinehub.co/shortcut/5134/), I (perhaps expectedly) would point you to [my own, 17-action Shortcut](https://routinehub.co/shortcut/8940/) which spares you any selections and simply opens the Song.Link URL of the track currently playing in Apple Music (while also copying said URL to the clipboard.) It’s not that MusicBot isn’t massively impressive and still useful, but it represents a class of super/hyper-Shortcuts which (from my perspective) _far_-overreach beyond the intended use case for Siri Shortcuts and end up immediately bewildering/alienating potential new users. Truthfully - as Federico singularly acknowledges - they are full _applications_ built atop a less-than-ideal platform designed for relatively simple, _repeatable_ automations. I’ll spare you further opining on this idea until another, potential Post, and instead demonstrate my personal solution.\n\nhttps://imgur.com/gallery/eblzlbD\n\nIn the clip above, you can see I was working on this very draft when LoneMoon’s “[kawAii @F](https://song.link/i/1554970332)” started playing. Naturally, I was compelled to share it on Twitter, so - without leaving Drafts (my writing app) - I called the [type-to-Siri](https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/siri-iphaff1d606/ios) prompt by holding the Sleep/Wake button on my iPhone 12 Pro Max and simply typed “sl” (I renamed my Shortcut for this use,) running the Shortcut, which opened the track’s Song.Link page in Safari - very much an optional step, mostly just to make sure the match is correct - and copied its URL to my clipboard, from which I could share it anywhere. Since the advent of widgets in iOS’ [Today View](https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/add-widgets-to-the-home-screen-iphb8f1bf206/ios), I’ve also kept a button for this Shortcut in one of four precious slots in a box at the very top. For those willing to play around a bit, it should be fairly straightforward to configure the end bits to your liking, but it should work out of the box for even those least interested in Siri Shortcuts/automation in general.\n\n![SongShift Playlist Transfer](https://i.snap.as/64kwh52h.png)\n\n### [SongShift](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/songshift/id1097974566)\n\nAs I confessed before, it is only thanks to SongShift that I was able to recover anything of my original, prized, deeply-considered Apple Music playlists. The [standalone ](https://www.macstories.net/reviews/songshift-3-0-and-switching-between-apple-music-and-spotify/)_[MacStories](https://www.macstories.net/reviews/songshift-3-0-and-switching-between-apple-music-and-spotify/)_[ article](https://www.macstories.net/reviews/songshift-3-0-and-switching-between-apple-music-and-spotify/) on this one is a bit dated, but I don’t see much change in function in that time. For most people, SongShift’s free service is simply the best way to transfer a playlist between music streaming services. If you find yourself genuinely sold by the features offered by [SongShift Pro](https://songshift.com/pro), I suspect you know more about playlist manipulation than I could ever learn you by diving in any deeper.\n\n![Lastfm on iOS](https://i.snap.as/HLJEWX0B.png)\n\n### [Last.fm](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/last-fm/id1188681944) (I s2g.)\n\nYup… Believe it or not, Last.fm is _still fucking scrobbling_ after 19 fucking years (almost to the day,) and its iOS app still fucking works. What’s most bizarre about this truth is that I did not encounter mention of Last.fm for _years_ until I started noticing it as an integration option in the settings menus of _these premium iOS apps_. Is this some sort of conspiracy? I’m not sure, but I suppose I might as well insist you follow my ancient account, if you’re still using it.\n\n\u003c!--more--\u003e\n\nI should also note that not only is the Last.fm iOS app still working, it’s _working well_, from all appearances, anyway. Though the service no longer includes hosting, itself, it’s apparently still a prime player in the world of **playback tracking**.\n\nhttps://youtube.com/watch?v=pSDCbXGIovM\n\n## Music Creation\n\n### DAWs\n\nWhat if you actually want to “make” music with your iPhone? We’ve seen iPhone television ads for years featuring amalgamations of musician-looking types playing instruments with cables attached to their handsets, but is the iPhone now a reasonable platform for any sort of serious sound capture? The short answer is **no**. Who am I to proclaim such an absolute? None other than the motherfucker who’s been messing around with mobile DAWs for [10 whole years](https://twitter.com/neoyokel/status/150752825129971712). I even “released” an “[album](https://dieselgoth.bandcamp.com/album/holistic-compliance-portal)” on Bandcamp made exclusively with Apple’s own GarageBand for iOS and inspired by the dangerous life of the contemporary raw milk smuggler. I wouldn’t call it “music,” per se, or an example of what a _real_ electronic producer could pull off in the app, but it does represent its capabilities in the hands of the average user, using mostly default loops.\n\nhttps://soundcloud.com/dieselgoth/wurlie-jam\n\nWhile Apple does publish an Apple Book entitled “[Everyone Can Create Music](https://books.apple.com/us/book/everyone-can-create-music/id1434741739)” about GarageBand on iOS, it is specifically directed at _iPad_-bound use. Any serious DAW user uses keyboard shortcuts, which I admit I only discovered recently in GarageBand for iOS. The [official documentation](https://support.apple.com/guide/garageband-ipad/use-keyboard-shortcuts-chs88452c59a/ipados) is - once again - for iPad, specifically, but most of them still work on iPhone.\n\n**[FL Studio Mobile](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/fl-studio-mobile/id432850619)** - the original third-party iOS-bound DAW - is still going, apparently. While I did, indeed purchase the original version on my iPhone 4, I remember absolutely nothing about it, suggesting I was over my head, even then. There’s also **[Auxy](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/auxy-music-beat-maker/id1034348186)**, as covered recently in [this App Store Story](https://apps.apple.com/us/story/id1478814064) and **[Reason Compact](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/reason-compact-make-music/id1253419004)**. I’ve played around with these more recently - since they’re both available in their most primitive forms as a free download - with little to report.\n\n### Capture\n\nDisappointingly, Apple’s own Music Memos - as demonstrated by Chris Welch from _The Verge_ in the embed, above - is currently in the process of being [officially sunsetted](https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/10/22168102/apple-music-memos-app-discontinued-export,) and is now no longer available for download on the App Store. As that article notes, users are instead directed toward GarageBand or ye olde native **[Voice Memos](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/voice-memos/id1069512134)** to record high quality audio. _However_, if you want to take advantage of the **stereo audio recording** capabilities included in iPhones after the [11 Pro](https://www.dxomark.com/apple-iphone-11-audio-review/), you must either use the native Camera app to capture video (and extract the audio later,) or **[Dolby On](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/dolby-on-record-audio-video/id1443964192)** - Dolby’s own iOS app for recording which - if I’m completely honest - will do nothing but _utterly frustrate_ anyone trying to capture the truest digital audio possible.\n\nhttps://youtube.com/watch?v=GhAknEKy9Ig\n\nAs part of my [iPhone 12 Pro Max Review](https://github.com/extratone/bilge/issues/45), I’ve accumulated quite a few audio files in various formats testing its capture abilities and stashed them in [this folder](https://github.com/extratone/bilge/tree/main/audio/Capture%20Testing) on _The Psalms_’ GitHub Repository. Probably the most relevant of these, though, is embedded just above. If you’ll forgive my pajamas, ridiculous piano faces, and general rustiness with the instrument, it demonstrates the “**Audio Zoom**” feature found in the iPhone 11 Pro and up, which I’ve found to be unfortunately underdocumented by Apple, itself. I added my own inquiry to [this post on the official Developer forums](https://developer.apple.com/forums/thread/124512?answerId=671299022#671299022) asking about it, but don’t really expect anything back. According to “[What is Audio Zoom for smartphones](https://www.dxomark.com/what-is-audio-zoom-for-smartphones/)?” published on the site _DxOMark_:\n\n\u003e The main technology behind audio zoom is called beamforming, or spatial filtering. It allows changing an audio recording’s directivity (that is, the sensitivity according to the direction of the sound source) and shape it in any way necessary. In this case, the optimal directivity is a hypercardioid pattern (see illustration below), which enhances sounds coming from the front direction — that is, from the direction in which your camera is pointed — while attenuating sounds from all other directions (your background noise).\n\nMy testing has suggested that **the best means of recording unfiltered-as-possible stereo audio with an iPhone is to record video at 1x zoom with the native Camera app** and extract the audio from the video file. In the [Bandcamp track embedded below](https://davidblue.bandcamp.com/track/-), I “mounted” my 12 Pro Max right above my old upright’s soundboard and extracted audio directly from the video file with Audacity. It was then amplified slightly, saved to a FLAC file and uploaded directly to Bandcamp. Of course, it’s worth qualifying that - while I have extensive experience with audio - I have neither professional training, nor any professional monitoring equipment.\n\nhttps://davidblue.bandcamp.com/track/-\n\nThat said, the biggest objection I’ve heard from audiophiles regarding audio capture and manipulation on handsets, generally, has to do with their hardware’s extremely limited capabilities when compared to any sort of professional desktop soundcard. Given the greater argument I've come to regarding the state of consumer tech as best exemplified by smartphone design - that we've come to expect _far_ too much of single devices, and the resulting jack-of-all-tradeness summing their real-life capabilities has become a **severe detriment** instead of a feature - I must echo, again, that adding \"studio\" audio capture, manipulation, and production capabilities to our _goddamned cellular phones_ doesn't help anyone. To any user truly hoping to accomplish these things, I say _just go home_ and boot up your damned desktop.\n\n![Mushish - Apple Music Web Player](https://i.snap.as/LGQO6IGJ.png)\n\n## Other Considerations\n\nThe final episode in _AppStories_' three-part miniseries on music was [just published today](https://appstories.net/episodes/214/), though I suspect - for my audience, anyway - that its coverage is mostly out-of-scope on this topic, largely for financial reasons. Apple's first event of the year is [scheduled for tomorrow at noon](https://youtu.be/JdBYVNuky1M), my time, and is entitled \"Spring Loaded,\" which - combined with its 4/20 joke date - suggests to me that we'll finally see the release of the APPLE GUN™ alongside iWeed™, but little to nothing in the way of music.\n\nIn the midst of my brief research into _The Greater History of Apple Music_, I discovered [the existence of iTunes Ping](https://thenextweb.com/news/apple-shuttering-failed-social-music-network-ping-september-30th) - which I somehow missed entirely, [along with my Twitter friend Jon Male](https://twitter.com/mrjaydeeem/status/1379305438454423559). I also discovered articles from the company's decision to [kill its successor \"Connect\" from Apple Music](https://thenextweb.com/news/apple-music-is-dropping-its-connect-social-features), which was reportedly \"[rarely used](https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/13/18139837/apple-music-connect-social-network-feature-discontinued).\" Notably, this removal also [took away](https://9to5mac.com/2018/12/13/apple-music-connect-ping/) what little power Artists had over the narrative surrounding their music on the service. I can see the business justification for all of this (barely) _except_ for removing the ability for users to follow artists.\n\nThe latest Apple Music feature - [a \"channel\" for music videos](https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/19/21523091/apple-music-videos-tv-channel-live-stream) - also makes zero sense to me, but [the launch of Apple Music on the web](https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/5/20851576/apple-music-web-player-interface-beta-browser-streaming) _absolutely_ does, especially for Windows and Linux users, who are now _officially_ freed from iTunes (the software) and allowed to use a much more modern Apple Music experience. I prepended \"officially,\" there, because third-party Apple Music web players have existed as long as the service has allowed the required integration. First, there was [Naveed Golafshani's](https://www.macrumors.com/2018/12/13/apple-music-unofficial-web-player/) - which is [no longer live](https://github.com/naveedgol/music-web-player) - but Brychan Bennett-Odlum's **[Musish](https://www.macrumors.com/2019/01/21/apple-music-web-player-musish/)** is still [live and working](https://musi.sh/), as you can see from the screenshot embedded above. Other than the ability to select between two stream bitrates, I can't seen any remaining advantages to using the latter over Apple's own web player, unless you harbor spite toward their handling of the whole thing, which would be entirely understandable, from my perspective.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/1359364473253937153\n\nAs someone who grew up in the mp3 era with a [first-generation iPod Shuffle](https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/1359364473253937153) and iTunes, living and dying between iTunes Store gift cards, Apple Music still seems like one hell of a magical deal. In effect, it allows access to _all of iTunes_ for a flat monthly fee. Or at least it _would_ had I never become acquainted with professional independent musicians who've published, there, and have to contend with tedious realities like [the process by which one can add those beautiful lyrics to Apple Music tracks](https://artists.apple.com/support/675-send-your-lyrics-to-apple-music), and who's only real means of control/engagement on the service has been removed with virtually zero prospects of a replacement. If, indeed, Jessica Lessin was correct about Apple's obsession with music, it has resulted in very little for any class of music makers, and left even its listeners to seek out and find third-party solutions like MusicHarbor to perform even the most basic personalization one expects from a modern music streaming service without even bothering to amend their App Store's discovery process to illuminate them, or even write a fucking App Story. Despite this, one-to-three-person app teams continue to work on new solutions, to these and other problems...\n\n#music #software","tags":["music","software"],"categories":[{"hashtag":"music","slug":"music","title":"music","post_count":0},{"hashtag":"software","slug":"software","title":"software","post_count":0}],"images":["https://i.snap.as/mTEozs2r.png","https://i.snap.as/4agfF1nW.png","https://i.snap.as/UxLBTYvL.png","https://i.snap.as/KylIYzaI.png","https://i.snap.as/64kwh52h.png","https://i.snap.as/yN3nbcdR.png","https://i.snap.as/9pNf178x.jpeg","https://i.snap.as/HLJEWX0B.png","https://i.snap.as/LGQO6IGJ.png"],"paid":false,"views":775,"collection":{"alias":"extratone","title":"Extratone","description":"For the New Curious.","style_sheet":"","public":true,"views":125790,"domain":"extratone.com","email":"extratone-p5beoxe3onlcm8o6jcrvwl@writeas.com","url":"https://extratone.com/","monetization_pointer":"","total_posts":0}},{"id":"c7r6cj5n2uryo7j4","slug":"vga-2020","appearance":"norm","language":"en","rtl":false,"type":"post","created":"2021-02-27T18:00:00Z","updated":"2021-03-01T07:17:52Z","title":"The 10th Annual Vidya Gaem Awards","body":"![Modern VGA Logo Orange](https://i.snap.as/COqvh2ZZ.png)\n\n## Today, the VGAs celebrate a whole decade of curation.\n\nhttps://youtube.com/watch?v=QbUtmpSKMGg\n\n### What?\n\nAn annual reflectory awards ceremony examining video games across platforms, continents, and genres wrapped in a feature-length motion graphics flex/sensory assault full of internet jokes.\n\n### When?\n\n**Feb 27, 2021 at 1900 EST (7PM)**\nSee: [Every Time \u0026 Date Page](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?msg=2020+Vidya+Gaem+Awards\u0026iso=2021-02-27T17:28:00\u0026p1=179)\n\n### Where?\n\n[Twitch](https://twitch.tv/vidyagaemawards), [YouTube](https://youtube.com/c/VidyaGaemAwards), and [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/4e8JQB4) (if you’d like to chat)\n\n|                       Essential Links                        |\n| :----------------------------------------------------------: |\n| [The VGAs’ super-slick web site for 2020](http://vidyagaemawards.com) |\n|      [VGAs Discord](https://discord.com/invite/4e8JQB4)      |\n|     [VGAs Twitter](https://twitter.com/vidyagaemawards)      |\n| [VGAs Steam Group](https://steamcommunity.com/groups/thevidyagaemawards) |\n| [VGAs YouTube Channel](https://youtube.com/c/VidyaGaemAwards) |\n|   [VGAs Twitch Channel](https://twitch.tv/vidyagaemawards)   |\n\n*If you consumed/participated in the live show, consider having a go at this year's [Feedback Form](https://forms.gle/ZL6fYu3mx5KNJKtH8).*\n\n#juegos","tags":["juegos"],"images":["https://i.snap.as/COqvh2ZZ.png"],"paid":false,"views":895,"collection":{"alias":"extratone","title":"Extratone","description":"For the New Curious.","style_sheet":"","public":true,"views":125790,"domain":"extratone.com","email":"extratone-p5beoxe3onlcm8o6jcrvwl@writeas.com","url":"https://extratone.com/","monetization_pointer":"","total_posts":0}},{"id":"r1xnciee1ui3pwpb","slug":"r1xnciee1ui3pwpb","appearance":"sans","language":"","rtl":false,"type":"post","created":"2021-02-15T10:30:01Z","updated":"2021-02-15T10:29:26Z","title":"","body":"","tags":[],"paid":false,"views":0,"collection":{"alias":"extratone","title":"Extratone","description":"For the New Curious.","style_sheet":"","public":true,"views":125790,"domain":"extratone.com","email":"extratone-p5beoxe3onlcm8o6jcrvwl@writeas.com","url":"https://extratone.com/","monetization_pointer":"","total_posts":0}},{"id":"gdqwfyka7qnwbx7y","slug":"soundcloud-mastering","appearance":"norm","language":"en","rtl":false,"type":"post","created":"2020-07-27T19:28:24Z","updated":"2020-07-27T19:28:46Z","title":"SoundCloud Releases Automated \"Mastering\" for Creators","body":"#### by [David Blue](https://twitter.com/NeoYokel)\n\n![SoundCloud Tile](https://i.snap.as/2eB6JrY.png)\n\nLast Tuesday, SoundCloud [announced](https://blog.soundcloud.com/2020/07/14/you-can-now-master-your-tracks-directly-on-soundcloud/) the release of onsite, automated mastering [in cooperation with Dolby](https://news.dolby.com/en-WW/190438-master-your-tracks-directly-on-soundcloud-powered-by-dolby). The service will cost $4.99 per track for non-Pro Unlimited subscribers, who'll receive three free mastered tracks per month and $3.99 per track masters after that. After uploading a new track (less than 10 minutes in length,) users will see a small button labeled \"Master Track,\" which then takes them to a trimming interface that prompts them to select a 30-second, \"high contrast\" clip representing the dynamic extremes of the track, which is then locked in as the singular preview for the service. After \"listening\"/analyzing said clip, the user is brought to the mastering interface and prompted to select between four presets:\n\n**Thunder**\n\"Make car speakers rumble and club systems shake.

This will also look at the past mistakes of other studies in not defining the differences in types of humor in relation to their effects on both professionals and clients. Making the distinction between lighthearted and gallows humor can change the entire meaning of a study. This thesis analyzes and explains the results from multiple studies and also explain why this field requires more research before any solid conclusions can be made.\n\n### Keywords\n\n**gallows** or **negative humor**, **secondary traumatic stress**, **lighthearted** or **positive humor**, **successful humor**\n\nMany studies have been done on humor and its uses as a coping mechanism in the workplace. The majority of these studies conclude that humor in the workplace is beneficial. Few of them differentiate between positive and negative humor, though. Because of this there is more than one answer to the question of \"is humor in the workplace good or bad?\" Professionals in career fields that involve Secondary Traumatic Stress often use forms of humor as coping mechanisms. In this essay, multiple studies that touch on the subject of humor in these types of workplaces will be analyzed. Gallows humor and negative humor will be used interchangeably, as well as lighthearted humor and positive humor and the following topics will be addressed:\n\n1. Explaining Secondary Traumatic Stress\n2. The distinction between lighthearted, gallows, and successful humor\n3. Positive effects of humor in the workplace\n4. Negative effects of humor in the workplace\n5. Effects of humor on clients\n6. Alternate coping mechanisms\n7. Further research\n\nThrough analyzing these topics, it can be concluded that, while successful humor can be a very good coping skill in stressful work environments, gallows humor is not and has even been linked to negative effects on the individual’s physical and psychological wellbeing.\n\n## What is Secondary Traumatic Stress?\n\nProfessionals who often deal with traumatic events experience a lot of stress. This type of stress, when it is severe, is referred to as Secondary Traumatic Stress. Secondary Traumatic Stress is defined [in the *Psychiatric Times*](https://www.psychiatrictimes.com/ptsd/secondary-traumatization-mental-health-care-providers/page/0/1) as, \"indirect exposure to trauma through a firsthand account or narrative of a traumatic event.\" This means that individuals who assist others during traumatic events or hear recounts of traumatic events run the risk of developing Secondary Traumatic Stress Syndrome. The symptoms of Secondary Traumatic Stress, or STS, are [similar to the symptoms of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26301442) which occurs in individuals who experience trauma first-hand. Professionals who deal with these kinds of issues include, but are not limited to: police officers, forensic nurses, firefighters, crime scene investigators, surgeons, therapists, and sex crime workers. In these professions, humor is often used to combat this stress or serve as a coping mechanism. The humor used as a coping mechanism in these careers can often be macabre due to the [austere nature of their jobs](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9131354). These professionals experience, secondhand, everything from serious injuries, to death, to the aftermath of sexual assaults and much more. These are not experiences that the average person goes through on a day to day basis. Because of this, it does take a toll on these professionals. This secondhand, or indirect, exposure to trauma can have huge emotional impacts on individuals and many believe humor can be used to combat this. In a study done on 133 human service professionals, ranging in age from 20 to 64, it was found that age, sex, and relationship status [did not have much effect on Secondary Traumatic Stress levels](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27286075). This means that anyone can be susceptible to developing Secondary Traumatic Stress in these career fields. \n\n## Different Types of Humor\n\nIn most contexts, humor is considered a positive aspect of communication while [the darker side goes unmentioned](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10538712.2014.949395). While humor can be used both in and outside of the workplace to lift spirits, this is not its only use. Humor was seen as an important staff skill by individuals involved in a study on Forensic Nurses, though timing and type were [never clarified in the research that was analyzed](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24847873). Humor can be intended for and perceived in many different ways. Humor can be seen as aggressive, rude, or sarcastic when at the expense of others. When used positively though, humor can be lighthearted and fun. It can also be used to express emotions like anger, frustration, and joy. While defining humor, Boes and Wormer point out that Freud thought of humor as \"a coping mechanism that allows society to reduce tension by expressing… obscene impulses in a socially acceptable manner.\" This statement implies that at one time gallows humor was believed to be tension-relieving and positive. Gallows humor refers to the dark sense of humor some develop while working in high stress career fields. It can be defined as \"humor that makes fun of a life-threatening, disastrous, or terrifying situations.\" It is often used only amongst certain groups of workers because others are seen as \"outsiders\" who [would not understand their sense of humor](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21980898). Craun and Bourke also touch on this, stating that professionals who all work with sudden traumatic deaths feel comfortable using gallows humor amongst themselves but know better than to use it with other workers, such as those involved in clerical work. Because of this, the group that uses gallows humor knows to censor themselves around \"outsiders.\" Successful humor is [defined as a mutually amusing communication](https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/02683941211199554/full/html). Both gallows and lighthearted humor can fall into this category depending on the situation but just because humor is successful does not mean it is positive.\n\n## When is Humor Good in Regards to Secondary Traumatic Stress?\n\nHaving a good sense of humor has long been seen as something that decreases depression, anxiety, and stress while increasing immunity to illness and enhancing moods. Positive humor can illicit positive responses, therefore having the potential to improve group processes in the workplace. Mesmer-Magnus, Glew, and Viswesvaran come to the conclusion in their meta-analysis that positive humor can build affinity, reduce burnout, increase workplace cohesion, and enhance coping effectiveness. Through analyzing the results of prior research, they were able to deduce that lighthearted humor was able to increase job performance and satisfaction, as well as, save money that would usually have been spent as a side-effect of employees being burned out. It can also be said from their research that positive humor in the workplace can be linked to better overall physical and mental health. So, it can be said that positive and lighthearted humor do correlate with positive effects. In Craun and Bourke’s qualitative study of 500 sex crime workers, they were able to show that lighthearted humor was used frequently by the Internet Crimes Against Children members through the use of several surveys. The use of lighthearted humor correlated with lower Secondary Traumatic Test scores and had more effect on the scores than social and coworker support.\n\nA type of humor that usually has a positive impact on workers is \"play on words\" humor. Play on words humor can be considered as a type of lighthearted humor. In a study done on humor used in the emergency room, this type of humor was discussed. This kind of humor can be purposeful, or it can come from a Freudian slip. An example given by Wormer and Boes is of a doctor accidentally saying, \"Just eat 'em and street 'em\" rather than \"Just treat 'em and street 'em.\" Another example given was of a nickname made for a surgeon who often wore cowboy boots and was \"very aggressive\" during his procedures. It was always said out of his ear shot, but his staff called him the \"cowboy surgeon.\" This kind of humor is harmless and facilitates a sense of community amongst the coworkers in the emergency room. \n\nTension relieving nonsense was another form of lighthearted humor discussed in Wormer and Boes’ analysis of humor in the emergency room. They called it tension relieving nonsense because this kind of silly humor often results in laughter. Laughing can help relax muscles, relieve tightness, and aid in creating a sense of well-being. Wormer and Boes pass on a story told by a nurse administrator, named Alice Guy, that encompasses tension relieving humor, stating: \n\nHospital staff members were having a party when word came that a patient was on the roof threatening suicide. Guy was furious at this threat to their fun. Rushing to the roof and speaking without thinking, she ordered, 'Get off that roof! You're interrupting the party.’ The man did. The humor of the story was that despite the fact that others had tried for hours to get the man off the roof, he obeyed the one person who simply spoke her mind – and in doing so went beyond the bounds of good professionalism. This amusing story was shared at the hospital for years after.\n\nThere are many positive ways to use humor as a coping mechanism, but this does not mean that all ways of using humor for coping are good. \n\n## The Use of Gallows Humor\n\nIn their meta-analysis, Boes and Wormer suggest that gallows humor is a way of maintaining sanity in insane conditions; that it is an illogical response to a hopeless situation. This is where the research begins to clash, because while this may be partially true, others believe the results of Craun and Bourke’s study help clarify that even if gallows humor gives you a sense of relief, it is only temporary because in the long run the effects of its use are not positive. Boes and Wormer gave an example of an inmate on death row jokingly turning down a cigarette because he had quit the prior day. This is an example of gallows humor because, generally speaking, people stop smoking for health reasons. They do not want to get cancer, emphysema, or they want to live to see their grandchildren, etc. Because this inmate is on death row though, none of these things apply to them so the inmate is seen as using gallows humor to make light of the fact he may not be alive much longer. Another example they give is about an inmate on death row asking about when they are going to start a weight watchers program. Again, this is gallows humor because realistically, this person will not be alive very long, so their weight is not an actual concern. The humor is just being used as a coping mechanism to make light of the fact the inmate is on death row. \n\nWatson has a similar concept of gallows humor as Freud. Watson is quoted in her qualitative research on gallows humor in the medical field saying, \"blanket dismissals of gallows humor as unprofessional misunderstand or undervalue the psychological, social, cognitive, and linguistic ways that joking and laughing work.\" [Another source](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/15325024.2010.507661) states that laughter can be used to help interrupt physiological stress responses because it increases exhalation and it eases muscle tension. Humor though, can exist as a separate entity than laughter and therefore does not correlate. Not to mention that in Craun and Bourke’s study, they found that the use of gallows humor correlated with higher Secondary Traumatic Stress scores and even had a higher effect on the scores than using denial as a coping skill did. Gallows humor was also linked to an [increase in alcohol consumption in participants in the past year and reduced psychological wellness](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10538712.2014.949395). Craun and Bourke point out previous studies imply that the use of gallows humor may be an indication of psychological distress in workers. These studies show that use and increasing use of gallows humor is an indicator that the professional is no longer compassionate enough to fulfil their job properly, as well as, the possibility that it is a red flag indicating that the individual is not coping with Secondary Traumatic Stress well. \n\nSome researchers believe that using gallows humor as a coping mechanism is not a big deal. They believe that professionals in career fields where Secondary Traumatic Stress is experience should use whatever methods necessary to cope. One of these studies makes the claim that \"The use of black humor among emergency services professionals would thus be seen as a form of stress release, relieving the professional of intolerable feelings of horror, helplessness, and anger, and this in turn would reduce psychic anxiety.\" They also acknowledge, though, that using this kind of humor to cope could end up with adverse effects such as increasing anger. They use the old concept of superiority theory to support these claims. Superiority theory states that using humor at the expense of others helps raise our self-esteem and by blaming victims for the unfortunate things that happen to them. Individuals can convince themselves they would never be in a position to experience the same misfortune. In their examination, they use a quote from Wear and Colleagues to support their stance, citing \"students enter the clinical world full of enthusiasm and optimism for what medicine can achieve and are met with obstacles of all sorts, including cynical faculty, uncooperative or unappreciative patients, and their own unanticipated emotional responses to the experience of hospital based medicine. Every day they encounter something that should be otherwise, and humor may be one way of managing the incongruencies.\" While it can be seen that humor is important in the workplace as way of managing the day to day events, once again, this quote from this study does not point out what kind of humor they are discussing. The study itself may go into further detail, but what is provided in the examination by Regehr and Rowe does not. \n\n## Effects on Work Relationships and Clients\n\nHumor can be used as a tool to bond with people. In the study on forensic nurses, they focused a part of their research on humor as a relational tool. They specified this as the use of humor with patients. The results were split, a good portion of the nurses said they believed humor helped with their patient relations while others stated that the use of humor in general was challenging the institutional order. They also stated that even the most well intended jokes can be misunderstood and taken the wrong way and that this possibility might make it less worth it to employ humor with patients, but correct use of humor could lead to a more relaxed patient. In another study of nurses, it was indicated that [those who were experiencing Secondary Traumatic Stress were more likely to be impersonal or angry with patients](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/320647022_Exploration_of_the_Association_between_Nurses'_Moral_Distress_and_Secondary_Traumatic_Stress_Syndrome_Implications_for_Patient_Safety_in_Mental_Health_Services) therefore reducing the quality of the patient and care taker interaction as well as colleague to colleague relationships. Another source reported acknowledging that using gallows humor with patients could dehumanize those who the jokes are about.\n\nThis open-ended result on the effects of humor on patients is just one of the many reasons more research needs to be done in this field. When patients use gallows humor, it is often seen as giving themselves power in a situation they are otherwise powerless in. While this is definitely one way to explain this phenomenon, it is possible that this could be interpreted in another way. The use of gallows humor as a coping mechanism may be a way of deflecting, preventing full acknowledgment of their emotional state. This room for interpretation is another reason why more research needs to be done in this field that distinguishes between lighthearted and gallows humor. \n\n## Alternative Coping Skills\n\nOne study that does look into alternative ways for workers to deal with Secondary Traumatic Stress suggests using resilience and mindfulness as an alternative coping mechanism. This study defines resilience as a \"buffer which protects individuals from adverse environmental influences and forces\" and \"the ability to bounce back from adversity, persevere through difficult times, and return to a state of internal equilibrium.\" The other suggestion is mindfulness. Mindfulness is defined in their research as \"an intentional state of awareness, mindfulness concerns the process of bringing one’s attention to the present moment, in a non-judgmental and accepting manner.\" Mindfulness is very effective in reducing stress and increasing what Harker, Pidgeon, Klaassen, and King referred to as resilience. Unlike resilience though, mindfulness has an explanation as to how to reach it. Mindfulness can be practiced through multiple techniques which range from quietly meditating to playing active games and are generally done in 5-minute increments in therapeutic settings but can be done for as long as the individual or group needs outside of the therapeutic setting. Increased mindfulness was linked with an increase of psychological well-being and with a decrease in Secondary Traumatic Stress scores. They also found that \"research investigating the beneficial effects of increased levels of mindfulness has reported improvements in distress tolerance, emotion regulation skills, and psychological flexibility. In order to conduct their study, they sampled a group of 133 human service professionals – mostly women – and gave them a series of questionnaires. The questionnaires they used were *The Professional Quality of Life Scale*, *The General Well-Being Schedule*, *The Resilience Factor Inventory*, and *The Freiburg Mindfulness Inventory*. The Quality of Life Scale has two subscales: one the measures exhaustion, frustration, anger, and depression symptoms and the other measures negative feelings brought on by work-related trauma and fear. Anxiety and depressive symptoms are assessed using the General Well-Being Schedule, along with overall psychological well-being. The Resilience Factor Inventory evaluates the individual’s level of resilience with 60 questions and The Freiburg Mindfulness Inventory evaluates the individual’s mindfulness using 14 questions. \n\nThe conclusions that these tests came to were that higher levels of resilience and mindfulness correlated with lower levels of Secondary Traumatic Stress. Mindfulness showed less effect on the levels while resilience showed much more. Mindfulness only made up for 1.77% of the variance and resilience made up 8.18% of the variance. The researchers did point out at the end, though, that the study was completely voluntary and therefore may have had skewed data. The way they framed the concern was that the employees who were experiencing the most Secondary Traumatic Stress may have been too emotionally fatigued to participate in the study and that this may have skewed the data. On top of this, they pointed out that self-report data can be unreliable due to the fact that people often show social desirability biases. \n\nBecause the symptoms of Secondary Traumatic Stress are so similar to the symptoms of Post Traumatic Stress, it could be said that treatments geared for PTSD may be effective in treating STS. One of these treatment paths are Cognitive Behavioral Therapies. \"[Cognitive behavioral therapies (CBTs) challenge the way individuals think and behave and are an effective intervention for treatment of PTSD](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4211431/).\" One type of CBT is CPT, or Cognitive Processing Therapy. This is a therapy that was originally developed to treat rape victims. In CPT, the traumatic event is revisited in order to facilitate reshaping the negative world views created by the traumatic event. An example given is of someone being raped and developing a view that the world is not safe. In order to combat this the therapist would assist in changing this view from \"the world isn’t safe\" to \"I can learn to protect myself in an unsafe world.\" By doing this, the therapist can help lower the distress levels of the patient, as well as avoidance, which is a component of PTSD. CBT involves homework for patients as well to help generalize the skills being taught within the clinical setting. \n\nAnother treatment often used for PTSD is Prolonged Exposure Therapy. This is a behavioral therapy that \"helps clients safely face frightening experiences and memories by recalling traumatic memories in a controlled fashion.\" This process is done gradually in a controlled setting so as to not overwhelm the patient. It is believed that this process can help the patient assess their symptoms and reshape their feelings and thoughts about the event that caused them to develop PTSD. It can also help the patient to slowly begin regular functioning on a day to day basis. \n\nPsychotropic medication can also be beneficial for PTSD patients. Some anti-depressants can help reduce the levels of depression, stemming from the traumatic event, in patients. There are many anti-depressants that are approved by the FDA to assist with PTSD symptoms. Anxiolytics, or antianxiety and antipanic medications, can be used to reduce stress and anxiety levels in individuals who have PTSD according to the Mayo Clinic. There are also medications such as Prazosin, an antihypertensive medication, that is not approved to treat PTSD by the FDA, but the Mayo Clinic believes could help keep nightmares at bay and combat insomnia. \n\nEye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing, otherwise known as EMDR, is evidence based when it comes to its effectiveness in treating Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. EMDR is a mixture of psychodynamic, behavioral, cognitive, and body-centered therapies. During this treatment, the therapist will use what is called \"bilateral stimulation.\" This means the client will work to process the traumatic event while the therapist uses \"eye movements following hand, tactile or auditory cues.\" During this process, the client goes back and forth between thinking of the traumatic event and focusing on the present moment. This is called \"dual attention.\" \n\n## Further Research\n\nWhile it is true that research has identified positive links between humor and emotional states, very few people have made the distinction between lighthearted and gallows humor. Because of this, studies that primarily focus on positive humor are often used to justify gallows humor in the workplace as well because the distinction was never made between positive and negative humor. The connection Watson makes between gallows humor and laughter earlier in the paper is an example of this, as well as Boes’ and Wormer’s interpretation of what using gallows humor as a patient indicates. The misconception that all humor is connected with laughing and therefore positive is just that, a misconception. This flaw in humor studies means that there is still a significant amount of research needing to be done in this area. Studies should be done to clearly determine what the effects of positive and negative humor are separately. Studies need to be done on professional-client relationships and the use of gallows humor. These studies should focus on groups where only the professional uses gallows, only the patient uses gallows, both use gallows, and then neither use gallows. It may be very difficult to find these relationships naturally but if it could be done, it could be said that this would be a very effective way of gathering data on these types of social relationships. It can also be said that it would be beneficial for professionals who use gallows humor to be evaluated individually to see if there is a correlation with things such as depression and anxiety and the use of gallows humor because very few studies do. Another aspect that would be good to look into is whether or not there is a difference in the effects based on sex and gender. Although one of the studies previously discussed sex alone, the study was almost 80% women and therefore could be biased. Even though many do not believe there are many physiological differences between men and women, the ways life is experienced in our patriarchal society may possibly leave one sex or gender more vulnerable to Secondary Traumatic Stress. In order to get past the self-report data bias, assessments in the future could be conducted using a psychiatrist or other assessment specific professional to administer the questionnaires in a format closer to how mental illnesses are assessed. A lot of these studies focused on correlation. This is an important factor, but future research should focus more on causation and include more factors that could be affecting the results of the experiments. Another beneficial thing to look into would be if certain therapies that show success with PTSD would show the same level of success with individuals experiencing Secondary Traumatic Stress. Because PTSD and Secondary Traumatic Stress have very similar symptoms, it is likely that there is some overlap when it comes to coping and treatment after the fact. \n\nWhile many studies conclude that humor in the workplace is positive, it can be seen from analyzing research that distinguishes between types of humor that gallows humor is not a healthy coping mechanism. In some cases, it can be an indicator that workers are no longer compassionate enough to work in their field and others that the worker is not managing their Secondary Traumatic Stress well. There is not a lot of research into alternative coping mechanisms to replace gallows humor, but it is possible that treatments and skills related to dealing with Post Traumatic Stress could be beneficial for people experiencing STS due to the fact that PTSD and STS share a lot of the same symptoms. This cannot be said with certainty though because there have not been many studies done on this. Mindfulness and resilience were shown to be helpful in handling STS though, and this is a step in the right direction to help professionals who experience indirect trauma on a fairly regular basis. It is important to further this research because a lot of these careers are necessary and helpful to the population even though they have adverse effects on the individuals doing the jobs. \n\nIn order to stress the importance of the researching more into the effects, gallows humor has in these professionals, it may be beneficial to explain why it is important to care for the mental health of these workers. Some helping fields get a lot of attention from the public and are more valued because of it, such as firefighters, surgeons, and police officers. If it could be explained why mental health workers are so important or why nurses and sex crime workers are so important, it may bring people’s awareness to them and the issues they face from working such stressful jobs. Many people don’t think about how much of a toll being in helping field takes on you but without these professionals so many people would go uncared for and untreated. Many of these workers are behind the scenes doing jobs most people would not want to do and risking their own physical and psychological well-being for others, and they deserve to have concrete answers as to how they can help protect themselves from the side effects of their jobs.\n\n🗎 [**Print/PDF**](https://github.com/extratone/extratone/raw/main/archive/gallows-humor.pdf)\n\n#culture","tags":["culture"],"categories":[{"hashtag":"culture","slug":"culture","title":"culture","post_count":0}],"images":["https://i.snap.as/sQ2V1X2.png"],"paid":false,"views":3204,"collection":{"alias":"extratone","title":"Extratone","description":"For the New Curious.","style_sheet":"","public":true,"views":125790,"domain":"extratone.com","email":"extratone-p5beoxe3onlcm8o6jcrvwl@writeas.com","url":"https://extratone.com/","monetization_pointer":"","total_posts":0}},{"id":"s929n5vxsfaefi3q","slug":"submissions","appearance":"sans","language":"en","rtl":false,"type":"post","created":"2020-04-18T00:44:48Z","updated":"2020-04-30T10:32:17Z","title":"Submissions","body":"![Submissions - Typing on Apple II](https://i.snap.as/wlaHt16.png)\n\n*Extratone* is proud to resume accepting submitted work thanks to the magic of [Submit.as](https://submit.as/).

If the Son of God was living today, most of us have agreed for a long time now that he’d use marijuana recreationally – big fuckin whoop. I think it’s far more interesting and appropriate (we all know his birthday was [wholly reconfigured into a consumerist holiday](https://www.thisamericanlife.org/47/christmas-and-commerce) long ago) to speculate on how he’d behave after finding himself inadvertently in the market for a new laptop within the ~$1000 range (following a *stubbed toe whilst walking on water* incident, perhaps.) Surely, it would not be entirely holy for him to opt in to the Foxconn-complicit world of Apple, Incorporated, nor the [openly-blasphemous](http://www.extratone.com/tech/google/) one created and exuberantly grown by Google LLC, and I’m afraid he’d be too much of an *End User* idiot to integrate any of the sparse Linux-dedicated hardware available. In May of 2017, however, Billy Gates’ old Microsoft finally released “[the laptop we’ve always wanted them to make](https://www.theverge.com/2017/5/5/15557738/vergecast-podcast-255-microsoft-surface-laptop-samsung-dex-i-clicked-the-doc),” but could its recent update be truly worthy of our Lourde and Saviour? Or your newly-enrolled offspring? Should you sprint downstairs and swap out the new MacBook Air you just bought?\n\n\u003ciframe sandbox=\"allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-top-navigation allow-popups\" scrolling=no width=\"100%\" height=\"185\" frameborder=\"0\" src=\"https://embed.radiopublic.com/e?if=end-user-WdbezM\u0026ge=s1!fb997569626371bb19366d2dc0e4a0be2793e9b4\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\nFrom an entirely valid perspective, an observer might declare my last two months of 2018 to be an outright shameful period defined by hypocrisy and traitorous betrayals. After finally taking the time to explore the full narrative surrounding Linux and the bloody tale of Microsoft’s cruel genocidal destruction of countless creative software projects throughout computing’s adolescence (see: “[Embrace, Extend, Extinguish](https://youtu.be/TVHcdgrqbHE?t=425),”) I eventually declared myself “100% Open Source” and began outlining an essay designed primarily to express that *Linux is finally ready to be the operating system of the people* without succumbing immediately to the brand of cybercrackpot illegitimacy associated with the L-word in the minds of the general public so readily thanks to decades of misinformed, condescending neckbeards. Such a feat would require entire new planes of cultural awareness and dialectal delicacy, yet certainly result in zero personal reward from even the best possible outcome, yet I proceeded to ponder the subject very deliberately all the way through October because I genuinely believed in a new democratized future of computing. 2018 had been my Grand Awakening to the idyllic possibilities of Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) across the whole applied spectrum from office suites to [social networks](http://bilge.world/federated/), yet – as two thousand eighteen comes to an end – I’ve managed to find myself among the most [jaded, soul-sapped](https://youtu.be/O0RSeFcv3Qs) tech community I have yet encountered: **Microsoft Administrators**.\n\nComplimenting this Linux-laden culture in which I was not so long ago deeply embedded was a confused and frustrated outlook regarding what I felt were excessive and completely idiotic sacrifices across the industry’s hardware design to the greedy, gluttonous god of Lightness. It seemed only reasonable to Myself As Consumer that the entire buying public should exclusively seek designs prioritizing greatest possible performance and battery life, even from portable computers and smartphones, so I assumed my perspective on this updated iteration of Microsoft's most laptopy Surface laptop – which exists in large part to [compete directly with](https://www.pcmag.com/news/364728/spec-down-apple-macbook-air-vs-microsoft-surface-laptop-2) Apple's beloved (and just-updated) MacBook Air – wouldn't be at all useful. However, a few weeks ago, my employer prompted me with a sweet sweet ultimatum: *for the sake of a tax break, I want to spend ~$1000 on a laptop for you as soon as possible*. Yes, I know I should consider myself a very fortunate man - this [wasn't even the first time](http://bilge.world/hp-spectre-x360-best-buy-consumerism/) I'd been surprised with the \"hey, I want to buy you a laptop but it has to be today\" experience, and may even be considered a sort of sequel to my *Tales of Whirlwind Manic Consumerism*, but it’s ultimately one of the most idiotic strategies to achieve a major purchase decision and completely inadvisable for anyone on a budget. Still I was indeed thankful to be put in a nearly-identical situation of Consumer Electronic haste, and have come to be especially appreciative of the specific time I was approached as such: just one week after [Microsoft launched the Surface Laptop 2](https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/16/17979516/microsoft-surface-laptop-2-review-specs-price-features-windows-10).\n\nConsidering the vast majority of its users are [trapped inside my television](https://theoutline.com/post/2923/the-popularity-of-microsoft-surface-is-the-least-realistic-thing-on-television), there’s no harm in covering the Surface brand with our virtual palm for a moment. If you’ll indulge me so, you’ll notice that Microsoft has actually delivered unto us **The Laptop II** – as in, the sequel... the *successor* to *every other laptop computer* yet conceived... but does this one machine truly represent the second coming of the *Notebook Christ*? Naturally, it would be a bit zealous to stand behind this extreme statement with 100% sincerity, but there truly *are* certain elements of this Personal Computing product's execution which do indeed will its user to expect and/or desire from others in coming years. As I've stated before, I also simply cannot help but be jazzed by such bravado from the mouths of even a company with as crooked and hateful history as Microsoft's. (Note: no other technology company has actually achieved what Microsoft historically has in this regard, and hopefully none ever will again.)\n\nI must be honest: it hasn't yet been two months and I've already scuffed and perhaps even *stained* the beautiful maroon alcantara surrounding my machine’s touchable body, but it’s occurred to me that I might draw upon the vast library of [automotive interior tutorials](https://youtu.be/PM-FbFIBoCs) available on YouTube – and even purchase some of the alcantara care-specific products they recommend – in order to *really* maintain the exterior of the Laptop II. After all, [alcantara was undeniably car culture’s material first](https://www.popularmechanics.com/cars/a9653/what-is-alcantara/). I should also confess that objectively, the Surface Laptop II is the best-suited computer for *my personal uses* that I’ve ever owned *or* used for any length of time. Subjectively, I don’t think all of the hardware design touches that make it so – like its keyboard layout, divine 3:2 aspect ratio, and particular I/O complement – have yet had the chance to seduce my emotional brain into truly *loving* it as much as I certainly should by any reasonable measure. For my own sake, I hope I’m able to fall in child-like infatuation with its magic, but in the interim, I believe the coldness of my heart should hopefully preserve any useful commentary I might have to add. Though this is undoubtedly the most timely review of a hardware product I’ve ever published, I’d still ask that you indulge my perspective suggesting the importance of considering it part of a *package* with its operating system, considering that the whole of tech media would’ve unanimously declared it the year’s “[best laptop](https://mashable.com/review/microsoft-surface-laptop-2/)” were Apple’s aging, but still widely-adored MacOS absent from the frame.\n\n\u003e I've tested a bunch of laptops this year, running the spectrum of 2-in-1s, Chromebooks, MacBooks, gaming laptops, etc. Everyone's needs are going to be different, which is why there's no such thing as a one-size-fits-all for laptops. But enthusiasts’ laptops aside, I strongly feel the Surface Laptop 2 is the best laptop of the year. And by that I mean the best laptop for most folks' needs.\n\nWith as much humility as possible, I must add that I myself am *anything* but “most folks,” yet my experience so far with the product has been one of astonishing compatibility and battery life. Using recommended power settings, the Surface Laptop 2 endured [**four hours and twenty-two minutes**](https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/1080514545062477825) of a workload it wasn’t particularly designed for including heavy web browsing, image manipulation, brief audio/video capture with OBS, and moderate subsequent editing in Audacity and OpenShot. Dan Seifert – Vox Media’s “[only Windows user](https://www.recode.net/2017/5/12/15628228/microsoft-surface-laptop-apple-macbook-air-windows-10s-dan-seifert-recode-podcast)” – reported “about seven hours” of Microsoft’s claimed 14.5, but frankly, I don’t know what any of y’all are doin – I’m just thankful this machine is a better marathoner than any other I can recall owning. While we’re on the subject, I consider Microsoft’s inclusion of a magnetically-attached power cable and unassuming auxiliary USB charging port on the attached power supply to be [personal godsends](http://bilge.world/laptop-disabled-even-speedier-tone/) – further evidence, even, that the Surface Laptop 2 was *actually designed to be nice to use*. For the sake of those readers **actually in the market for a new laptop** who’ve somehow found themselves here, though, Raymond Wong’s review for *Mashable* is the most thorough offering you’ll find – it’s quoted front and center on [Microsoft’s web page for the Laptop II](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/surface-laptop-2/8XQJKK3DD91B), even – but it’s important to mention that his critical comparative perspective predates the late launch of its ultimate competitor, [the new MacBook Air](https://mashable.com/review/apple-macbook-air/). Rather pitifully, however, his colleague’s “good, but not great” resolution suggests that Apple failed to challenge Microsoft’s relatively moderate update enough to warrant any revision, and that *Mashable* as a publication stands by my new laptop’s *Best of the Year* title, for whatever it may or may not be worth to you. \n\n\u003e If the new [MacBook Air](https://zdcs.link/zjWl1?pageview=06Fe2GZo26XvMYZgLndTadT) came in at the same price as the old one, it would be a steal. Sure, you pay for the privilege of being able to use macOS on the Apple ecosystem. But in years past that also meant access to cutting-edge features and design. As pretty as the MacBook Air is, there's nothing that innovative about it. In today's Apple, it seems, privilege amounts to just staying current.\n\nYou won’t find many others who regularly invest editorial merit in publishing 2500+ word laptop reviews anymore, which I’d concede is plenty reasonable in the Surface Laptop’s case, at least. Perhaps your first point of comparative entry should be [a barely-dated conversation](https://www.recode.net/2017/5/12/15628228/microsoft-surface-laptop-apple-macbook-air-windows-10s-dan-seifert-recode-podcast) between Kara Swisher, Lauren Goode, and Dan Seifert on *Too Embarrassed to Ask* regarding the original’s odds of truly competing in the “premium laptop” segment (if you’d prefer to hear from those who struggle to take it seriously, that is.) Assuming [the original product direction of the Surface line](https://www.zdnet.com/article/what-oems-desperately-need-to-learn-from-microsofts-surface/) still stands, Microsoft doesn’t actually intend to sell at high volume, especially when it comes to this runt of the marque, which does not hesitate to omit itself from the popular discourse of the moment surrounding tablets as the future of all computing to which all of its siblings have [contributed so much](https://www.theverge.com/2014/5/23/5743416/microsoft-surface-pro-3-review). Though I shall always remember my dearest Libel (the special edition Spectre x360 with which I built most of *Extratone*) with great respect and deep fondness – I think it’s even worth mounting on some sort of plinth – the significantly-cheaper Laptop II has already demonstrated true value in its “premium” segment bragging rights with *far* superior materials and build quality. If you’re looking for the prettiest possible slice of magnesium lightness but aren’t the sort to have followed the story of Microsoft’s first venture into personal computer production since it began in the last year of the Mayan calendar, it’s worth your while to read [Joshua Topolsky’s projections of the project’s impact on the popular narrative surrounding Microsoft](https://www.theverge.com/2012/6/19/3097726/surface-microsoft-next-chapter/in/2859835) from history’s freshest possible perspective: the eve of the first Surface tablet’s launch.\n\n\u003e The entire tablet was designed in-house by Microsoft's teams, and if you believe what was said in the presentation yesterday, design and functionality in hardware has suddenly become a big deal in Redmond. That's a big shift, and it's an important one. The announcement of the Surface shows that Microsoft is ready to make a break with its history — a history of hardware partnerships which relied on companies like Dell, HP, or Acer to actually bring its products to market. That may burn partners in the short term, but it could also give Microsoft something it desperately needs: a clear story.\n\nA pungent stigma festered from Microsoft’s history of inadequate and inelegant public relations (especially compared to its greatest longtime rival) has remained in relentlessly obvious orbit around every “significant” Windows and Office update for so long that its status quo has grown into a truly inhibitive force for *all* parties involved. Topolsky is unquestionably a compromising favorite of mine, but it’s hard not to decry then-CEO Steve Ballmer’s failure to comprehend Josh’s day-after insight in the *whole three months* that passed before [his Seattle Times interview in September, 2012](http://old.seattletimes.com/html/businesstechnology/2019168601_microsoftballmer16.html). Ultimately, The Big M is either **incapable** of understanding any alternative utopic Visions of Computing to its own, or simply **overwrought** with the same counteraspirational carelessness its culture has always depended upon. In analytical terms regarding Ballmer’s utilization of the forum’s opportunity to finally *tell the fucking story*, at least, the timidity of a term like “pre-eminent software” as a viably bright new beacon in contrast with “*people* would say we were a software company” (emphasis mine) – as if Steve-O himself doesn’t even have the power to publicly *describe his company’s function* as its #1 man – combined at the apex of what was almost impressively-negligent behavior.\n\n\u003e I think when you look forward, our core capability will be software, (but) you'll probably think of us more as a devices-and-services company. Which is a little different. Software powers devices and software powers these cloud services, but it's a different form of delivery...\n\nDon’t make the same mistake I did and wear yourself out trying to extract the meaning from these three sentences – there’s none to be found. Ultimately, whatever opportunity the Surface project could have provided for Microsoft’s identity has been vastly overshadowed by its success as last resort supercatalyst to restore *any* sense of dignity and pride within the hardware companies who produce the vehicles. In Fall 2017, *The Register* [quoted industry gossip](https://www.theregister.co.uk/2017/10/04/surface/) regarding the company’s new CEO Satya Nadella and his intent to “exit the product line” because “overall they are not making money [and] it doesn’t make sense for them to be in this business,” but newcomers to this conversation should know that no subsequent reporting has corroborated anything but a [sustaining future of the line](https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/5/18125306/microsoft-fluent-design-windows-office-surface-future), though the measurable rate of innovation in Microsoft’s products continues to leave much to be desired. Now that you’ve heard from the experts, though, allow me to expand our lens a bit and examine what the Surface Laptop 2’s existence suggests as per *The Present \u0026 Future of Computing*.\n\n## The Clam Clan\n\nIn case I’ve yet to mention it, all of my tech writing is in substantial debt to my much-older and child-oriented siblings for providing 8 nieces and nephews over the course of 11 years – if not for any reason but the perspective offered by the slightest observation of their day-to-day lives. In this profoundly bizarre and historic technological sprint our species is experiencing, the differences in their respective relationships with consumer tech as they’ve grown up are fascinatingly… disturbingly significant. My eldest niece Abby was born four years after myself in 1998, and her younger sister Amber just quite three years later in 2001. All three of us are Aquarians who went to the same public schools (aside from 2 exceptions on my part,) and the two sisters have been close, significant influences on each other all their lives, yet the way Abby and I use and think about computers differs significantly from Amber’s. Our first real PCs introduced an important social and intellectual vehicle to our pre-teen lives, and both of us still “live on” our machines as young adults. For us and many others from this short-lived microgeneration of ours, budget laptops like the Dell Inspirion 2200 (which served as the first “real computer” for both of us) introduced the internet and Being Online as a State of Being with AIM groups, MySpace, and Yahoo! chain mails before smartphones and tablets were capable of doing so.\n\nAmber prefers to use her iPhone for most everything and regards her computer as a tool for work – it’s booted up and down exclusively for that purpose, which is significantly healthier than the habit Abby, myself, and many of my Online friends developed: we left our computers running and Logged On all the time because we were otherwise unreachable. We learned from origin to depend on them for 100% of our computing tasks – from streaming Pandora to playing Flash games within six billion open browser tabs – which likely explains both our ADD and its resulting influence on the ease with which our personal computers can distract us. As a Journalism student and professional photographer, Abby uses the new 15-inch MacBook Pro, and [Insane Blogger] David Blue has spent years looking for an alternative, becoming [the first and only iPhone user to make extensive use of its Bluetooth keyboard support](http://bilge.world/ios-10-review-speed/) in the process, but both of us are entirely uninterested in the rest of the industry’s insistence on [convertibles](https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/2/17515896/dell-xps-2-in-1-convertible-laptop-review), [removable keyboards](https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/16/17979504/microsoft-surface-pro-6-review-tablet-features-price-windows-10-matte-black), or [‘professional’ tablets](https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/5/18062612/apple-ipad-pro-review-2018-screen-usb-c-pencil-price-features). I wish the Linux community was finally ready to drop the elitist pretenses plaguing its nerdy history; I wish I could finally tell someone like Abby that a machine like the [System76 Galago Pro](https://www.pcworld.com/article/3198671/linux/the-system76-galago-pro-is-a-fierce-featherweight-competitor.html) could slot itself into her workflow without losing her time or compatibility – that the reputation surrounding Linux People had finally lost most of its validity and her desire to learn more about computing as a young woman and Power User would be met with respectful and worthwhile conversation from their end. Unfortunately, I’ve still found some of the Old Guard to be elitist, socially behind, and juvenilely possessive, as if computing was still the niche interest from their 1980s and 90s childhoods. Though this conversation certainly warrants its own essay in the future, I’ll just express now that it’s a real shame some folks don’t realize the entire point of making great things is ultimately to **give them to the world**.\n\nThe opportunity I’ve had in the past year to finally get my Linux distro frenzy over with and out of my system managed to both radicalize and democratize my understanding of MacOS, Windows, and Linux as they are in the present. While I had nothing better to do, fiddling with Ubuntu Studio and Linux Mint to the extent I did throughout Spring and Summer led me to further appreciate [the value of keyboard shortcuts](https://mastodon.social/@DavidBlue/101073796864823479), gave me [my first real proficiency with a command line](https://mastodon.social/@DavidBlue/100917824456128537), helped [globalize my comprehension of my own technological privilege](http://bilge.world/internet-connection-withdrawals-telegram-opera/), reacquainted me in a huge way with both [the true history of software](https://www.reddit.com/r/vintagecomputing/comments/9hpqov/lotussmartsuite_and_the_year_2000/) and my own personal past as [an experimental test tube baby of Microsoft’s](https://mastodon.social/@DavidBlue/100771954295147256), and helped to answer a lot of questions I’d [worried over for years](http://www.extratone.com/audio/futureland/sorghum/) about why software seemed like it simply *couldn’t improve* anymore. While it’s true that important open source projects like [ElementaryOS](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jasonevangelho/2018/09/10/elementary-os-first-impressions-a-great-linux-doorway-for-macos-users/#231f4faa4289) continue to sprout from the Linus Extended Universe and the [growing Open Source community on Mastodon](http://bit.ly/dbmastodon) is filled with brilliant, helpful, unpretentious, and remarkably curious enthusiasts (probably because many of those I’ve interacted with so far are non-cis and/or non-white,) little ole me was able to stumble upon some totally unnecessary and excruciatingly ignorant sociopolitical commentary by way of the white, middle-age host and his undoubtedly-white and staunchly libertarian caller on a live broadcast of the *Ask Noah Show*. (It’s not as if I haven’t said ignorant and very ugly things too, but I wasn’t a forty-something *father* on a semi-professional talk show representing an entire community.)\n\nEssentially, I was quite frustrated and disappointed to find that **Linux is still let down most by its own community**, but the operating system itself is still *much* further along on its way to becoming a real alternative for the average user than mainstream tech journalism would have you believe. However, in my case, finally taking the time to *really* learn about Open Source computing *also* helped me understand (surprisingly) why Apple and its environment continue to be the best and most popular choice for professional applications. Linux Mint gave me tremendous power in enabling me to alter, specify, and redesign the most minute details of its interface, but I couldn’t have foreseen how all-consuming such power would be for someone like myself. In retrospect, I’ve realized that I ended up spending more time perfecting my custom LibreOffice Writer shortcuts than I did *actually writing* – I somehow found myself in a mind state which justified unironically creating *a shortcut for the Shortcuts menu*. Though I swore I’d never succumb to the bewildering hobby of collecting and exploring different Linux Distributions, it took no time at all for me to fill a folder with disc images of the installers for almost a dozen different interpretations of the operating system after I’d made the simple concession to myself that *I’ll just try Ubuntu, that’s all*. The most profound realization from all this (arguably otherwise wasted) time: **for a user like me, a walled garden is actually the best place to be productive** because *apparently*, I don’t have the self-control to keep myself from *running away* and/or fixating on completely unproductive tasks without its boundaries. I think this phenomenon is perhaps the worst culprit in the persistence of the aforementioned divide between “computer people” and everyone else who simply *uses* computers, as I’m sure any one of the latter could tell you after all of five minutes with a Linus type.\n\nThe most comprehensive and somewhat-urgent revision to illustrate the significance of this contrast from my perspective regards the exceptional iOS/MacOS markdown-based notetaking app Bear. Frankly, my own “[Word Processing Methodology](http://www.extratone.com/words/processing/)” essay from June has already become problematically out of date (and therefore embarrassing) in terms of my own knowledge of the segment and its history. Though I promised the conversation was “done,” I’ve continued to explore further into word processing’s history as well as its current state. “I had a go at Bear’s free iOS experience and saw little functional difference from DayOne,” the old, negligent, cursory David Blue noted, but if I’d simply been willing to cough up a bit more time and just $1.49 a month for [Bear Pro](https://bear.app/#pricing), I’d have spared myself such shame and realized that the hype around this app really is 100% justified. **Bear is the most beautiful iOS app I’ve ever seen**, but I’m now also fully qualified to declare it the most effective execution of “distraction-free” writing software to come along in the past 25 years. Developer Shiny Frog’s secret is their perfect balance between capability and simplicity. It turns out, [Daily Content Lord Casey Newton’s word on this matter](https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/2/14785264/evernote-replacement-bear-app) *really was* worth more than mine, not to mention more succinct: “Bear may look simple, but there’s power underneath the surface.”\n\nThose longtime Linux and Windows diehards who’ve tolerated me thus far, listen up: MacOS may be ancient, neglected, and full of incongruencies, but its single-minded methodology paired with Apple’s iCloud *really does* make it the most effective and elegant environment for most people to simply *get shit done*. It’s clear that many of you have realized the importance of simplicity for compact and/or educational distributions, but let me just add that **the democratization of Linux provides a gargantuan development opportunity to make something that beats MacOS at its own game** without starting from such a shitty premise and all of its resulting compromises – all without detracting from any other technically-minded distributions whatsoever. *That* is the magic of *The Distro*, remember?! If you’ve existed in a similar state of confusion to that of my entire adult life regarding the appeal of Apple products – despite having once been an extensive OSX user, myself – *you’re very welcome* for the insight. Instead of paying me for the profound self-improvement I’ve just provided, try prioritizing this newfound knowledge the next time you talk to your MacBook Pro-loving friend about their workflow. If you’re like myself, you’ll find their arguments have magically transformed from the bewildering bullshit they’ve always seemed to be into challenges for future competing operating systems to surpass Apple’s old bitch and excel in because MacOS and [even its much-younger iOS counterpart](http://bilge.world/ios-12-review-siri-shortcuts/) – as well as the billions of people who depend on them – *desperately* need real competition in order to maintain their viability, much less become what products of the world’s wealthiest company *should* be.\n\nYes, the manner in which these operating systems are perceived really *is* an important discussion prompted by a product as insignificant as the Surface Laptop 2 because as you read, the industry is bracing for another *paradigm shift* in computing, which many believe (preposterously, I might add) could be as significant and disruptive as 2007’s introduction of the iPhone. This machine of Microsoft’s and its “new” MacBook Air counterpart could potentially be the last designs to carry us to a computing future where the tried-and-true clamshell design is forgone entirely by the mainstream, but [Apple’s release of this year’s new iPad Pro](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/oct/30/apple-new-ipad-pro-launched-all-screen-design-face-id-usb-c-processor-magnetic-keyboard) prompted even [the most Cupertino-loving](https://supercomputer.transistor.fm/13) tech commentators to respond with *genuine discord* along with a few long-overdue shouts of “*are you crazy*?!” I’m very proud of *The Verge*’s [Nilay Patel](http://twitter.com/reckless), in particular, for so eloquently deconstructing its usability for all but the very wealthy. “It is impossible to look at a device this powerful and expensive and not expect it to replace a laptop for day-to-day work,” he reminds us in the introduction to [his full review of the updated product](https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/5/18062612/apple-ipad-pro-review-2018-screen-usb-c-pencil-price-features), along with a beautifully transient sentiment which I think we all needed to hear again: “I don’t think people should adapt to their computers. Computers should adapt to people.” Even something as consumerist and bourgeois as the introduction of another pricepoint-burgeoning Apple hardware flagship can turn a simple tablet review into a much-needed manifesto for a user-centric way forward for the industry, which is itself worthy of celebratory encouragement.\n\nI’ve favored *The Verge* and its cast long past the point of excess [throughout the span](http://bilge.world/?s=verge) of my work about technology, but Nilay’s review and its [accompanying episode of *The Vergecast*](https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/8/18075992/vergecast-podcast-330-ipad-pro-macbook-air-review) are *truly* special and profound gems of content that shouldn’t be passed up. Apparently – as the Editor-in-Chief immediately insists as the episode begins – his “ongoing theory” that “the more important you are, the less actually important work you do, and the more likely you are to be an iPad user” roused anger from “that whole class of [billionaires,]” but the experiences behind his argument actually suggest that Apple’s own favorite child of late – into which it has begun investing and thereby implicitly *sponsoring* over its much older brother as the ultimate heir of the majority’s future computing – has unequivocally **failed** to do its part in growing the iPad Pro into the “laptop replacement” we’d all heard so much about. Of iOS 12’s performance as an operating system beneath true work-related tasks, he exasperates “you have to spend all of your time figuring out how to do stuff instead of doing stuff,” which I couldn’t help but hear as echoes of my own late Linux lamentations. As thankful as I am to have finally achieved enlightenment of the Planet Apple, I’m afraid I was pitifully late: its very natural laws underwent their most brutal tests of the 21st century this past year. Now that I’ve finally come to adore the elegant effectiveness of a new generation of iOS apps like Bear, I’m faced with yet another of the episode’s statements of weight: “I think it’s time to stop pretending that the future of computing looks like Apple’s restrictions.” On the opposing end of the line, the world’s first trillion-dollar company’s *other* major product release of 2018 [managed to disappoint](https://www.engadget.com/2018/11/09/apple-macbook-air-review-2018/) even the most fanatical fans of its original operating system’s best-selling platform with [an insultingly mediocre update to the MacBook Air](https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/6/18064552/macbook-air-2018-review-retina-keyboard-apple-features-battery-price) marque upon which it [once so fondly doted](https://www.engadget.com/2008/01/25/macbook-air-review/).\n\nMy best friend’s parents bought her [the original Surface tablet](https://www.theverge.com/2012/10/23/3540550/microsoft-surface-review) when she enrolled in art school, and her frustration with its lackluster keyboard (among others) leads MacOS alternative-seeking users like us to wish Microsoft had started with a traditional design like the Surface Laptop first. Perhaps Apple and Microsoft’s emphasis on their tablets is nothing but a bit premature for the *most* current crop of users, and the rest of my nieces and nephews will expand upon an entirely different methodology of usership when they receive their freshman computer. Those elders of us who still take the Clamshell form seriously and love printing our documents are apparently facing a future industry saturated with products we can’t believe in, but it’s up to you to decide if this issue is worth expending your energy in advocacy for either camp. With my 120+ word per minute proficiency with physical keyboards, *I* for one have been completely bewildered by the iPad as anything but an indulgence for reading text on the web, and I’m pleased as punch with my Surface Laptop 2. Even if it proves to be the last new computer I’ll ever own to come as optimized for my use, I’m just grateful and astonished it happens to be the best yet.\n\n#hardware #microsoft #future","tags":["microsoft","future","hardware"],"images":["https://i.snap.as/Py8bIP7.jpg"],"paid":false,"views":1663,"collection":{"alias":"extratone","title":"Extratone","description":"For the New Curious.","style_sheet":"","public":true,"views":125790,"domain":"extratone.com","email":"extratone-p5beoxe3onlcm8o6jcrvwl@writeas.com","url":"https://extratone.com/","monetization_pointer":"","total_posts":0}},{"id":"52bwuqjpxii16xp0","slug":"illiteracy-coverage-american-media","appearance":"norm","language":"en","rtl":false,"type":null,"created":"2018-11-12T21:00:00Z","updated":"2019-07-18T20:48:39Z","title":"Illiteracy in American Media","body":"#### by [David Blue](http://twitter.com/neoyokel)\n\n![Tump](https://i.snap.as/5NU852K.png)\n\nTen percent of the United States' adult population cannot functionally read or write ([conservatively](http://literacy.kent.edu/)) despite the exponential increase of required reading in the average American's day-to-day life thus far in the 21stcentury. For written American media, especially, one would assume that a financial and social incentive for maximum literacy in the populace should present a straightforward justification for intense widespread coverage of this particular disparity, yet most related coverage in mainstream national magazines and newspapers is alarmingly sparse and often requires a less-than-socially-conscious context (e.g. a [for-profit startup](https://www.fastcompany.com/90259739/this-mobile-learning-platform-aims-to-combat-the-hidden-epidemic-of-adult-illiteracy)) to actually appear in news feeds. From the most wholesome assumption of the industry's general values -- that it holds \"[newsworthiness](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/newsworthy)\" above all -- we must assume that it does not generally consider American illiteracy \"interesting enough to the general public to warrant reporting\" as we examine the intermittent discourse surrounding the issue that *does* achieve publication.\n\nIn late October, the American business and technology magazine *Fast Company* covered the recent successes of the \"for-profit social enterprise\" Cell-Ed, noting that \"a huge portion of the American labor force is illiterate,\" which it described as \"a hidden epidemic.\" The article's author, Rick Wartzman, mentions foremost that Cell-Ed's userbase is largely \"foreign-born\" and expected to eclipse one million in number by the end of 2019. Demographically, the magazine's readership is predominantly middle to upper-class, who are the least affected social groups by a significant margin as per illiteracy's strong correlative relationship with poverty. These factors combine to limit any real social consequences from such an article.\n\nIn direct contrast with the professional, market-minded perspective of modern business magazine, even niche independent publications from the opposite end of the media spectrum often trivialize, belittle, or generally mishandle the issue. In [a 500-word \"Editorial\"](https://www.baptiststandard.com/opinion/editorials/if-you-can-read-this-be-thankful/) written by *The* Editor [Eric Black](https://twitter.com/EricBlackBSP) of the *Baptist Standard* -- a small evangelical news website describing itself as \"Baptist voices speaking to the challenges of today's world\" -- he points to a *global* increase in \"illiterate people,\" as he so comfortably brands them. Such language is inevitably counter-productive and potentially insensitive: to the eyes and ears of activists, educators, and the general public, such a term unnecessarily lends toward a restricted perspective of those people who have been left behind by the institution of read and written language in one manner or another and portrays them as a great vague collection of lingual lepers bearing their own distinct, inexorable, wordless ethnicity which *inevitably* bars them from the freedoms allowed by the Editor's learned capacity, including the ability to actually read his words of affliction. Simply put, he has dangerously oversimplified the issue.\n\nTo once again assume the best and infer that Black had a specific purpose in publishing his ill-supported opinion beyond continuity's sake of [his weekly Editorials](https://www.baptiststandard.com/opinion/editorials/), it appears to be the promotion of a local Texan literacy \"ministry\" called [Literacy Connexus](http://www.literacyconnexus.org/), though no further specifics about the project are provided beyond \"helping churches develop literacy programs for their communities, provide training and resources to overcome illiteracy,\" which is virtually identical to the introductory copy on [the organization's homepage](http://www.literacyconnexus.org/).\n\nSo far, we've examined coverage only in special interest media, but what about legacy news organizations with the largest readerships in the United States? Despite oblivious use of the same ledes, a newspaper like *The Washington Post* can wield vast influence over the broadest possible readership and the public editorial trust. In November 2016, veteran reporter Valerie Strauss published \"[Hiding in plain sight: The adult literacy crisis](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/answer-sheet/wp/2016/11/01/hiding-in-plain-sight-the-adult-literacy-crisis/)\" for *Answer Sheet* -- her weekly newsletter designed to function as \"a school survival guide for parents (and everyone else), from education policy to psychology\" -- which represents the most substantial discussion of American illiteracy in topical, widely-visible media (i.e. presence in a succinct search engine query.) She briefly introduces the issue with a bulleted list of illiteracy's consequences on modern society and the individual cited from a [Canadian literacy foundation](https://www.fondationalphabetisation.org/en/) before turning the stage over to [Lecester Johnson](https://aohdc.org/about-us/staff/lecester-johnson-chief-executive-officer/), CEO of the [Academy of Hope Adult Public Charter School](https://aohdc.org/about-us/staff/lecester-johnson-chief-executive-officer/) in Washington D.C.\n\nJohnson presents a passionate and well-informed exploration of the state of the literacy battle from the perspective of a full-time, locally on-the-ground advocate. Her op-ed's introduction includes the most essential observations and statistics throughout, noting \"the children of parents with low literacy skills are more likely to live in poverty as adults and are five times more likely to drop out of school,\" before setting upon a detailed examination of current and relevant organizations working toward *solutions*. Of course, it's largely centered upon her own organization, which she claims has \"helped more than 6000 adults rebuild their education and job opportunities since 1985.\"\n\nIt's significant that an institution as deeply embedded across the American political spectrum as *The Washington Post* address the issue of American illiteracy, and both Johnson and Strauss are certainly qualified voices for the undertaking, but when we examine this particular article, it's important we consider the context of the *Answer Sheet* newsletter and its intended audience. Though it's no challenge to pitch the importance of reading and writing to parents and professional educators, the most alarming and destructive issue at hand is the educational disparity between *their adult peers*. \"There's a literacy problem in the capitol, but I'm not talking about young people who can't read. Many adults -- perhaps even parents sitting next to you at back to school night -- don't possess academic skills,\" notes Johnson with her very first paragraph. However, considering the nature of parenthood, the audience primarily consuming these words are undoubtedly preoccupied with *juvenile* issues, specifically, and we can assume their capacity to empathize with their fellow working adults who could benefit from literacy education is actually *lessened* from that of childless readers of the same age as a result. \"Despite the magnitude of the adult literacy crisis, most of those needing to make up lost ground are pushed toward traditional classroom settings--even though many of these people can't possibly follow through because of cost or work schedules or other obstacles,\" she attests.\n\nPerhaps more than any other American city, Detroit has been struggling with a serious illiteracy problem. According to [a profile of the Beyond Basics program](https://www.wxyz.com/news/conquering-illiteracy-one-neighborhood-at-a-time-with-beyond-basics-program) (which was adapted from an [embedded video broadcast](http://bilge.world/media/detroitliteracy.mp4)) on their local ABC affiliate's website, forty-seven percent of adult Detroiters cannot read, but even companies like General Motors -- who donated \\$250,000 to the Beyond Basics program earlier in mid-October -- are getting involved. The article quotes Elijah Craft, a young man who was \"reading at a first-grade level as a senior at Detroit's Central High School.\" \"Craft would rare venture from home for fear he would get lost because he could not read street signs,\" reports *WXYZ* anchor [Carolyn Clifford](https://www.wxyz.com/about-us/staff/carolyn-clifford). She frames the narrative around a reference to the 2009 film *The Blind Side* starring Sandra Bullock: \"here, you might call this story 'The Detroit Side.'\" For local television news, this reference to popular culture likely strengthened the story's power ensnare viewers' emotional attention when it was aired, and even in this written accompaniment, it proves an effective -- if a bit crude -- analogy. The broadcast of Mr. Craft's interview also depicts his own deep emotional investment in reading when he begins to shed tears, which is not entirely communicated in the written article.\n\nWhen the American news media discusses American illiteracy, it's almost always in secondary or tertiary form: either by way of a short post for a weekly education newsletter, an ultra-low-distribution niche editorial column, or a personality profile of a local activist. Perhaps the fundamental obstacle in the face of increasing the discourse surrounding this issue is that its resolutions will require -- perhaps more than any other social issue in this country -- advocacy by those who *can* read on behalf of those who *cannot* because of how sensitive and isolated many of them feel. When voices of advocates like Lecester Johnson *are* uplifted by major organizations like *The Washington Post*, the sociological weight of the illiteracy issue can be very powerful. In quoting former United Nations chief Kofi Annan, she sums up for its extensive audience what the facts should ultimately mean to them: 32 million of Eric Black's so-called \"illiterate people\" in the United States of America have been and continue to be deprived of their \"***human right***\" to functional literacy.\n\n#literacy #media #class #future","tags":["literacy","media","class","future"],"images":["https://i.snap.as/5NU852K.png"],"paid":false,"views":934,"collection":{"alias":"extratone","title":"Extratone","description":"For the New Curious.","style_sheet":"","public":true,"views":125790,"domain":"extratone.com","email":"extratone-p5beoxe3onlcm8o6jcrvwl@writeas.com","url":"https://extratone.com/","monetization_pointer":"","total_posts":0}},{"id":"q9fecudegllwv1y1","slug":"robyn-body-talk","appearance":"norm","language":"en","rtl":false,"type":"post","created":"2018-10-19T04:49:24Z","updated":"2021-10-26T20:27:53Z","title":"The Timeless Dynamism of Robyn's 'Body Talk'","body":"##### by [Adam Bexten](https://twitter.com/adambexten)\n\n![Robyn](https://i.snap.as/BTp3K3a5.jpg)\n\n## On the eve of her new album’s first single reveal, we reflect on the Swedish artist’s incredibly-sincere, yet profound past contribution to the pop mystic.\n\nOn August 1, pop-extraordinaire Robyn released “[Missing U](https://song.link/i/1436781120),” her first proper single in eight years. Fans of the Swedish singer have long awaited a new album since 2010’s critically acclaimed Body Talk, but certainly were not left without material deserving of years of repeat-listening.\n\nDubbed the “_Body Talk_ series,” Robyn [initially announced](https://pitchfork.com/news/38039-robyn-plans-three-albums-for-2010/) plans in early 2010 to release three mini-albums over the course of the year, but after releasing Body Talk Pt. 1 and Pt. 2, plans were altered and _Body Talk_ — a compilation of the best songs from Pt. 1 and Pt. 2, plus five new songs — was released on November 22, 2010. Described by Robyn as the “turbo version” of the album, fans were gifted an ever-evolving collection of songs that was eventually edited into a single pop masterpiece. Despite never reaching great commercial success, Body Talk today continues to garner a cult-like following and new fans. In 2014, _Pitchfork_ named it the [36th Best Album of the Decade](https://pitchfork.com/features/lists-and-guides/9465-the-100-best-albums-of-the-decade-so-far-2010-2014/?page=4) thus far.\n\nMost astonishingly, the album is built upon a foundation of intense honesty. Specifically, an honesty that’s only possible when paired with polished pop hooks and hidden amongst heavy synth. Robyn never misses a shot. The album is calculated, direct and always on target, regardless if she’s reminiscing on unrequited love, instructing a new lover on how to let his ex-girlfriend down gently, or giving the middle finger to everyone who keeps telling her what to do!\n\n“[Dancing On My Own](https://vimeo.com/54353808),” the album’s debut single, remains a fan favorite and clear standout. On the track, Robyn explores the idea of dancing with tears in your eyes to a new level in the dancefloor tragedy of watching an ex-lover move on to a new woman. Don’t let the song’s catchiness mistake you. Upon hearing the first note, almost anyone would want to run for the dancefloor, but the track’s true genius lies in its lyrics, demanding stuck-on-repeat listening as you fall deep into her storytelling. It’s worthy of the all the acclaim it’s received, and more.\nAs Robyn bounces between the larger-than-life electo-queen on “Don’t Fucking Tell Me What To Do” and “Fembot” to the vulnerable, sentimental-synthesizer on “Stars 4 Ever” and “Indestructible,” she encapsulates emotional experiences in a way that is usually absent from the charts’ biggest hits. Her songs are bottled feelings.\n\nToday, and in 2010, the genre of pop is often treated as synonymous with singles dominating Top 40 stations – sometimes for good reason. The radio-ready songs are written and produced like products of a pop music factory. They’re strategically designed to get stuck in your head, to grab attention and ultimately, to make money. It’s commercial; it’s a business, but this false equivalence can lead many a music lover to discredit the entire genre as just an earworm, divorced from artistry. Body Talk puts all these arguments to rest.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3a2qoyONVA\n\n“[Hang With Me](https://song.link/us/i/1440714992)” details the exact moment early in a relationship when you realize you can trust your partner and let down your walls. Upon first listen, the lyrics seem obvious and simple, but eventually you realize that’s where the brilliance lies. Robyn’s ability to tap into those universal moments and experiences that most of us can only recognize, not articulate. Not only does she accomplish this, here – she makes it catchy.\n\nThe entire album can be enjoyed at surface level without great interpretation or introspection. Robyn matches her ability to capture euphoric emotion with infectious beats, witty lyrics and over-the-top production. It can transport you back to your very first crush or your very first heartbreak. It can heighten your confidence to make you feel invincible or it can break you down to your most insecure form. It’s pop perfection.\n\nAs Robyn readies her eighth studio album, she returns to a different, darker world. “Missing U” doubles as a message for both the fans that have waited eight years for this moment and for the lover that left. One can’t help but imagine how this song might be played differently in a less solemn present, but either way, Robyn arrives just in the knick of time, offering the escapism of grand production, unforgettable lyrics and a perfect world where even our greatest problems can be solved out on the dancefloor. Like _Body Talk_, it’s not going to actually save the world, but it provides listeners a perfect opportunity to escape the heat, dance it out and – at its best – see themselves in a remarkably honest way.\n\n#music","tags":["music"],"categories":[{"hashtag":"music","slug":"music","title":"music","post_count":0}],"images":["https://i.snap.as/BTp3K3a5.jpg"],"paid":false,"views":209,"collection":{"alias":"extratone","title":"Extratone","description":"For the New Curious.","style_sheet":"","public":true,"views":125790,"domain":"extratone.com","email":"extratone-p5beoxe3onlcm8o6jcrvwl@writeas.com","url":"https://extratone.com/","monetization_pointer":"","total_posts":0}},{"id":"l6e4uxm60w6ge76f","slug":"radio","appearance":"wrap","language":"en","rtl":false,"type":null,"created":"2018-07-26T09:00:00Z","updated":"2021-11-13T09:26:38Z","title":"Radio","body":"![Extratone Radio](https://i.snap.as/lBCNqyG.png)\n\nhttps://open.spotify.com/episode/77t4NP5umZs5pdSd92iMXZ\n\n## From footwork to the history of dirigibles; from ancient mythology to the puny Silicon Valley Gods — Extratone Radio draws from our varied voices to deliver to the curious the most entertaining sounds around.\n\n\u003c!--more--\u003e\n\n* [APPLE PODCASTS](http://bit.ly/extrapple)\n* [ANCHOR](http://anchor.fm/extratone)\n* [SPOTIFY](http://bit.ly/extrspotify)\n* [BREAKER ](https://www.breaker.audio/extratone\\*radio)\n* [CASTBOX](http://castbox.fm/channel/id1347882)\n* [GOOGLE PODCASTS](https://www.google.com/podcasts?feed=aHR0cHM6Ly9hbmNob3IuZm0vcy85YTlmOTgvcG9kY2FzdC9yc3M=)\n* [POCKET CASTS](https://pca.st/1FXa)\n* [RADIOPUBLIC](https://play.radiopublic.com/extratone\\*radio\\*WYDa1L)\n* [STITCHER](https://www.stitcher.com/podcast/anchor\\*podcasts/extratone\\*radio)","tags":[],"images":["https://i.snap.as/lBCNqyG.png"],"paid":false,"views":2278,"collection":{"alias":"extratone","title":"Extratone","description":"For the New Curious.","style_sheet":"","public":true,"views":125790,"domain":"extratone.com","email":"extratone-p5beoxe3onlcm8o6jcrvwl@writeas.com","url":"https://extratone.com/","monetization_pointer":"","total_posts":0}},{"id":"ghk5drfzc0m2bexo","slug":"unsolicited-creative-advice-ryan-dell","appearance":"wrap","language":"en","rtl":false,"type":null,"created":"2018-05-28T11:00:00Z","updated":"2019-07-27T14:34:12Z","title":"Unsolicited Creative Advice from a Smart, Nice Guy","body":"##### by [Ryan Dell](http://www.ryanmarkdell.com/)\n\n![Unsolicited Creative Advice](https://i.snap.as/ccmuLix.jpg)\n\nHaha, hi, what’s up? I know I’m probably the 20th person to slide into your DMs today but I just couldn’t resist the ‘vibe’ on your profile. You have this alternative, quirky  aesthetic, and I’m really into it. How do you even come up with your  ideas? You’re a really special talent, I can tell.\n\nBefore I get into the main reason I’m sending this  message — have you ever considered being a model? Not just an  Instagram model, a real model. Like for a Vice marketing campaign  or something. You have a really specific look and you might look  good if you were photoshopped a certain way. (That was a “neg”, haha.  It’s this gross pick-up artist technique, I would never do it  personally but I can explain it to you in detail if you like.)\n\nOkay, so, let’s cut to the chase. Why am I sliding into your DMs? The direct messages. The old inbox-a-roonie. Well, the truth is, I saw your work on social media, and it blew my mind. I mean, whoah, to do the work you do? You must really know how to use your Macbook. Not everyone can do stuff like that. I mean, I see a lot of work on the internet, but your art, wow, you’ve got some amazing stuff online.\n\nYou have real potential, you know that? But I don’t wanna see that potential go to waste. There’s room for improvement. I mean, your work is good, don’t get me wrong, haha. But I think we could elevate it, do you know what I’m saying? Together we could take it from about a 6 and lift it to a strong 7, possibly even 8.\n\nIs it weird that I’m sending this message? I don’t want to be too pushy or anything! If these messages make you feel uncomfortable at any time let me know and I’ll stop. Just gimme a little heads-up and wave the white flag and these messages will come to a halt. No more messages — except for maybe one or two follow-ups where I try to clarify where I stand with you. Three, tops. No more than three messages to get me out of your hair. I might send a fourth farewell message, but that’d be the end of it.\n\nThe main point I have is about the way you write online. I mean, it’s good, but it needs some more formal structure. It’s not your fault, you just don’t know the convential rules of writing. You could be amazing if someone just showed you how to write properly. Maybe I could teach you how? Like, nothing too intense, haha, I just have some tips that might save you some time and improve your work. Like, did you know that you’re supposed to get up and walk around for 10 minutes every hour? And drink a couple litres of water every day.\n\nHaha, I’m just trying to help! Doing this stuff could really help elevate your work. If you were a good writer instead of a bad writer, you’d be much more successful.\n\n\u003ciframe width=\"100%\" height=\"265\" src=\"https://clyp.it/zt2zmbqo/widget\" frameborder=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\nThe other main point I have is about your photography. Now, honestly, it’s shit. Sorry to be so blunt but I’m just kind of a brutally honest person. Yes, it’s true, I’m only ever honest when it involves me being cruel and never when I’m being reflective or positive, but some people just can’t handle that. I think you can, though. You’re special. Us special people have to stick together.\n\nAre you single? Haha, just kidding, you don’t have to answer that. Unless you want to. Then in that case I’d like you to answer it immediately.\n\nSo, with your photography, next time you’re taking a photo, just think to yourself, “Is this photo shit?”. Then, if the answer is yes, don’t take the photo. I personally don’t use this technique (unnecessary for me) but if you did it I think it would really improve your work. If you need some guidelines on what a good photo looks like I could send you a .zip file of all my Facebook cover photos from 2015 onwards and you can start from there, haha, they’re all pretty good. Maybe that would help you figure out if photography is a realistic career goal for you.\n\nMy last tip is more general. It’s a pretty good tip though, in my opinion: you need to try harder. I mean I like your work, but it just feels like you aren’t fully committed. Maybe you should quit your job? Then you’d have more time to spend on your art. An artists’ salary is probably more than you make now, haha. Think of quitting your job as a long term investment! I won’t say more on this though, since I’m not a financial expert — don’t want to be too presumptuous!\n\nWe need more good art in the world. And less bad art. That’s probably a controversial opinion, but I’ve never been afraid of speaking my truth.\n\nI have much more advice to tell you but I’ll leave that for later in our DM dialogue. I already feel confident we’ll get along, so if you’re interested in saving some time, just send me your phone number. We can chat over FaceTime Audio (but no other service, I refuse to pay for a cellphone plan out of principle) and figure out your long-term career plan. I’m getting so excited right now, thinking of all the amazing things I’m going to accomplish now that we’ve connected! We’re going to take your art career from being that vulnerable amoeba into being a beautiful, incandescent butterfly.\n\nThere’s a lot of rude guys out there, so as one of the nice ones I’d really appreciate it if you take my advice on board. I see a lot of potential in you, haha!\n\nP.S. Haha, have you ever considered being less angry when you post online? I think your work would be more popular if you were nicer. You’ll attract more flies with honey than vinegar!\n\n------\n#spectacle #ryandell #social #parody","tags":["spectacle","ryandell","social","parody"],"images":["https://i.snap.as/ccmuLix.jpg"],"paid":false,"views":809,"collection":{"alias":"extratone","title":"Extratone","description":"For the New Curious.","style_sheet":"","public":true,"views":125790,"domain":"extratone.com","email":"extratone-p5beoxe3onlcm8o6jcrvwl@writeas.com","url":"https://extratone.com/","monetization_pointer":"","total_posts":0}},{"id":"az638d3n14o2l6r4","slug":"solo-star-wars-film-review","appearance":"norm","language":"en","rtl":false,"type":null,"created":"2018-05-25T18:30:00Z","updated":"2020-05-01T03:11:35Z","title":"‘Solo: A Star Wars Story’ Is Dumb Luck Wrapped in Toxic Themes","body":"#### by [David Blue](http://twitter.com/neoyokel)\n\n![Hands Sorrow](https://i.snap.as/6UghZsm.jpeg)\n\n## The repugnant missteps of ‘Star Wars’ in the hands of Ron Howard and the long-awaited conclusions about the nature of cinema’s luckiest character to which they lead.\n\nIt's opening night at the Bagdad Theater on Hawthorne in Southeast Portland and hardly anybody’s bothered to show up. Less than 20% of the venue’s 500 seats are occupied by the time the host takes the stage to introduce *Solo*, but those who *are* here for the last Thursday showing have been shouting, whooping, and gurgling bad approximations of wookiee noises since the screen cut to black from its ad slideshow. If my middle row can be assumed an accurate sample, only a handful of these are “fans” enough to feel compelled to wear a *Star Wars* t-shirt. As I grab my last cocktail, the bartender tells me that only 300 folks showed up for the evening matinee, though he himself was “excited” to see the movie — one of a minority among Portlanders, apparently, who still give a shit about *Star Wars.*\n\nBy design, *Solo: A Star Wars Story* is a *slightly* more complex film than The Episodes in the same way *Rogue One* was, if a bit better executed, narratively. First, please rest assured that Alden Ehrenreich assumes the Han Solo persona as truly as anyone could — he triumphed through a [ridiculously extensive casting process](https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/tv/2016/10/05/phil-lord-chris-miller-fox-son-of-zorn-last-man-earth-making-history/90722222/), and is certainly handsome enough (if not more conventionally so than his predecessor) to consistently look the part. He actually bears an unsettling resemblance in features and mannerisms to one of the nicest guys I’ve ever met and that through-and-through boyishness particularly makes sense here, set in Han’s formative, earnest youth — the stated purpose of the film’s existence. Franchise fanatics, then, should be content. (It’s a good thing CGI-ing the main character in a live action film isn’t quite a low-risk option yet.) And yes, Donald Glover completely *steals* the vain, infinitely stylish Lando Calrissian and inevitably makes one wish to [see him cast again](https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2018/05/lando-calrissian-movie-donald-glover). Personally, I am very tired of seeing Woody Harrelson, though all the [components of his public persona](https://www.theguardian.com/global/2018/jan/07/woody-harrelson-i-used-to-have-my-head-up-my-ass-) should all but ensure his likability. From [what I saw in *Three Billboards*](http://extratone.com/three-billboards-outside-ebbing-missouri-review), I’d concede that he is as talented of an actor as I am capable of appreciating, but his role as Tobias Beckett in *Solo* couldn’t possibly be substantial enough to actually make use of his craft.\n\nThough I don’t believe in “spoilers,” or use of the term to bait readers, it’s worth stating for the record what everyone should know by now: **there simply aren’t spoilers in a Star Wars movie** — every human being on Earth knows too much about the formula to ever have any of these films’ comparatively irrelevant plots “ruined.” The most surprising, historically-significant decision of this whole production was the [omission](http://screencrush.com/does-solo-have-an-opening-crawl/) of the traditional yellow type opening crawl over a backdrop of distant stars, which I genuinely found myself missing. (Apparently it wasn’t present in *Rogue One*, either — I just failed to catch it.) I was very pleased to see my own number one favorite device of the franchise used within this film’s first ten minutes: crimelords and gang leaders as hugely magnified variations of the creeping and crawling creatures our instincts are planned to abhor. *Solo*’s first villain — the gigantic, wormlike boss Lady Proxima (Linda Hunt) — is completely inconsequential, and only appears in a single scene, but the practice of grossly oversized monstrosities leaving absolutely nothing of a baddie’s essence to be extrapolated by the audience from nuance is one of very few ways these films are let loose, and it openly shits on the more pretentious viewer’s assumptions about good writing, which I think big money movies should feel more comfortable doing, generally.\n\nThis first act begins on Han’s home planet Corellia — the bleaker urban, industrial, working-class counterpart to the clean capitol cityworld Coruscant — with his rather predictable mission to escape Lady Proxima’s sphere of control with his girl, Qi-ra (Emilia Clarke,) who could and should have been more creatively named, given her importance not as her own character with depth to develop (a no-no for a female role, Gourd help us,) but as Han’s mirror image to grow darkly apart, proving that he — *The Good Guy* — is unquestionably more morally fortified than anyone else in the whole goddamned universe. After having been drug through so very many, I couldn’t tell you at this point how to make the introductory escape action of this sort of production more exciting and less formulaic. Big surprise — their plan goes awry, and Qi-ra is prevented from leaving the planet with Han, who’s immediate (and I mean *immediate*)solution is his enlistment in the Imperial Navy via the recruiting station right there in the damned spaceport (during which the film takes the liberty of seizing his surname’s explanation) to serve the English in their grand conquest of the universe. Bizarrely, he manages to serve as a grunt for *three whole years* of complicity in unmentioned atrocities until he encounters the disguised criminal Wise Old Woody in the middle of pulling a job with his two-person crew. The team doesn’t agree to bring Solo along until he meets an asset in Chewbacca for the first time as he briefly inhabits another of the classic *Star Wars* trap: *the hungry monster in a shadow-filled mud pit*, but is spared the wrath because of his introductory grasp on Chewie’s shrieking language (called [Shyriiwook](https://web.archive.org/web/20061201002846/http://www.starwars.com/databank/character/chewbacca/)) in which he manages to sufficiently pitch the advantages of his survival, and the two escape, chained together. Observing the addition of Wookiee to the deal, the crew briefly debates the prospect’s new value in providing “needed muscle,” which convinces Woody to return for them and kicks off a series of case studies in this film’s bizarre attitude toward the commodification of the oppressed.\n\nHowever, in a rare depiction of his volition, Chewbacca *is* briefly consulted before the two seek to be formally included on the job, and is even asked around a campfire, later, what he’s shooting for in life at the moment, to which he responds “finding my family/tribe.” Despite having spent a whole three hellish years in the trenches with the British, the romantic Han Solo declares his primary motivation for all of it still lies in his desire to return to Corellia and rescue Qi’ra. In their stolen Imperial ship, the lot descend on a snowy mountain-traversing Maglev to steal the Uranium it’s transporting in a scene that’s straight up jacked from animated family classic *The Polar Express*, but… *oh no!…* A gaggle of “marauders” called the *Cloud Riders* (yet another throwaway proper noun) roll up on [those speeder bikes from Endor](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/74-Z_speeder_bike) (except these can fly,) and screw up everything *so* badly that both of Woody’s crew end up dead and the booty scuttled. After the fact, Woody reveals to Han that the job was contracted by yet *another* carelessly-named crime syndicate — *Crimson Dawn*, and that his only possible course of action is now vigorous brown nosing to its leader, Dryden Vos (Paul Bettany) ((aka Scarred Jarvis,)) in the waning hope he’ll spare his life to make another attempt. Following this information, he firmly suggests that Han and Chewie fuck off, lest their faces become known in the underworld, dooming them to serving it forever, apparently. Already, this vague presumption of Han’s purity which all of the protagonists must constantly venerate in martyrdom is getting tiresome, as is the dynamic of his insistence against them.\n\nNaturally, both Chewie and Han end up along for a visit to Scarred Jarvis’ tower yacht, where the latter *very* conveniently stumbles upon none other than his long lost love, Qi-ra in the bar. Despite having spent the past three years at war in unspeakable conditions thinking only of how to liberate and be reunited with her, he isn’t bothered to express more than the moderately-excited and surprised hug you’d expect of someone who’s just run into the kid down the cul-de-sac from their childhood home who used to ride her bike over for popsicles on Sunday afternoons. While he does rehearse for her the tale of their reunification as his one motivation for everything since they were separated — including his presence there, “right now,” he follows the profession up quite abruptly with the sly suggestion that they fuck as soon as possible. True to trope, she is jaded and indefinite as she distantly implies her binds of servitude while flashing the tattoo of the extremely-forgettable and innocuous Crimson Dawn logo on her right wrist. (The total lameness of the brands in this movie *must* be intentional. I can think of no other explanation.)\n\nThe evil Scarred Jarvis is then introduced, quickly stealing the crown for Best Host of all *Star Wars A*ntagonists before politely asking Woody why he shouldn’t kill the lot of them. As per his infinite luck, Han pulls the idea of stealing *unrefined* Uranium out of his ass, which has somehow never occurred to anyone else in the room, despite their unanimous top-of-the-head knowledge of the single location where it is mined. Shortly, the merry three plus Qi-ra conveniently in tow are off to a casino-esque establishment to find Lando, who Qi-ra describes as “attractive, stylish, charming,” and like adjectives, to Han’s obvious sexual chagrin, which is furthered by his subsequent loss of a card game with Lando’s ship — the *Millennium Falcon*, of course — in the stakes. Of course, the attractive, beautifully-dressed black man only bests Solo — the earnest, simpleton, *Good Guy* white dude who wears the same outfit for decades — in front of Qi-ra, the female prize by way of sleight-of-hand, the film shamelessly playing on that strange insecurity white guys have about their partners’ secretly everpresent and very powerful temptation to dump them without warning for black cock. Further emasculation is inflicted on poor little Han when Lando turns his *oh-so-crafty* (actually just very charismatic) charm upon Qi-ra, who reveals that *she’s* the boss of the gig. The final blow to Han’s dickitude is cast when he tries to enter the negotiation between the two and Lando chides “the adults are speaking,” but eventually agrees to provide them a lift for a 25% cut, so the lot make preparations to leave.\n\nEnter my new favorite character of the franchise, Lando Calrissian’s co-pilot, L3–37 (voiced by Phoebe Waller-Bridge,) or “L3,” the proudly sentient, violently revolutionary pro-rights droid who is introduced as she is pleading with two fighting droids in a square cage surrounded by screaming spectators (easy does it on that thematic slavery) to circumvent their “fighting programs” because they “don’t have to do this.” Though Lando and the crew behave like her duress is foolish and unimportant — pulling her away to the *Falcon —* she is allowed another opportunity to free droids very soon, but not before *Solo*’s single short private conversation between two female characters.\n\nOn the way to Kessel, Qi-ra stops by the cockpit and converses with L3. Until recently, I was unaware of what’s largely regarded as the worst habit of male writers with female characters: **if and when they have a one-on-one conversation between another female character, it’s only about other male characters**. Sure enough, L3 begins by insisting to Qi-ra that Han is in love with her, insisting by the objective findings of her sensors — which Qi-ra uncharacteristically denies like a bashful little girl before L3 continues on about Lando’s longtime love for *her*, and why it must remain unrequited, which we are encouraged to laugh at by the doubt Qi-ra voices without much hesitation regarding the hypothetical union’s sexual mechanics because it’s so *preposterous.*(I’ll get back to that in a moment.)\n\nWhen the team arrives on Kessel and infiltrates the mine, L3 creates a “distraction” when she begins removing the restraining bolts from droids in the control room, calling the practice *savage*, or *uncivilized*, or maybe *barbarian —* I don’t quite remember. As she frees them without any noticeable detraction from her duties as Seth Green of the heist — hacking controls, remotely opening doors, and all that — the droids begin to help free others in an exponentially multiplying circle of liberation until they become a rowdy mob who’s *cute* acts of rebellion are spaced throughout a few minutes of screentime in short jumpcuts off the other crew as they fight deeper into the mine. With the most significant emphasis ever placed upon Chewbacca in *Star Wars* history, he halts when he spies slave Wookiees struggling to find off enforcers and informs Han that he’s going to break off and assist them. Since Chewie’s only allowed to speak to the audience through Han’s retorts and never directly, it’s impossible to know how he phrased it, exactly, but from my perspective, his appeared to be the expression of a wish to do what Han had to *agree* to release him to do, as would a master, not a “partner.” Of course, Solo *does* agree, albeit hesitantly, because he’s *The Good Guy*, while quite inconsiderately expressing his desire to see Chewie again soon instead of wishing him success. However, releasing him to free his people (as per his primary life goal, expressed before,) means that Han has to load *twelve* of the *super heavy* unrefined Uranium tubes onto the cart *all by himself* and push it fully loaded at least *50 whole yards* without the assistance of his big strong slave. Boy, *what a pain in the ass!* He’s spared his laboring, though, when Chewbacca returns after no time at all with the enslaved Wookiees he’s just heroically rescued, who he then *immediately asks to assist his master* in pushing the cart — performing the *same labor* they were forced to do under the enslavement they were supposedly liberated from, seconds before.\n\nThe heist has inadvertently (nice, huge emphasis on *inadvertently*) ignited a slave rebellion throughout the mine, which serves the crew only as a distraction for the guards. The chaos is interrupted a half dozen times or so by those jumpcuts back to the control room of *adorable little droids* enacting their pitifully amusing revenge on the equipment — slapping a keyboard with a cookie sheet-like pan, stomping on a control panel, etc. — while L3 shouts parodical quasi-Marxist battlecries, which… yes… include referring to the freed droids as “comrades.” She even radios Lando at one point and triumphantly proclaims that she’s “found her true calling.”\n\n\u003e If and when a female character has a one-on-one conversation with another female character, it’s only about other male characters.\n\nBy the time the Uranium cart is within its last few yards of the awaiting *Falcon*, the riot has reached the landing bay and the guards around its perimeter have readjusted their priorities to disabling the ship’s landing gear. This interrupts Lando in the cockpit, who has chosen this time to work on dictating his autobiography because he’s a man who bothers to dresses himself well and is therefore oh so *maniacally, comically*, and *unreasonably* vain! How berserk! Still looking good as hell, he emerges and stands on the ramp to cover the rest of the crew’s return and loading of the dangerous Uranium with blaster fire, shouting the obligatory intermittent “come on, hurry up,” until L3 appears, also firing a blaster and shouting until she arrives in front of Lando, before noticing some commotion(?) with droids behind her and turning around, again fervently shouting more liberation cries. Lando doesn’t budge from the *Falcon*’s side, but yells after her, until he watches as she is shot repeatedly and falls, prompting him to run to her side. Filmed unnecessarily gruesomely, her head and shoulders separate from what’s left of her lower body when he first tries to hoist her up. Of course, his recklessness gets him shot in the arm, so Chewie returns to carry them both to the safety of the ship, where the injured Lando holds her head lovingly in his arms for her last moments, repeating “I can fix you, I can fix you.”\n\nNow, I understand that *Star Wars* movies (or their reviews, for that matter) are not the sort of entertainment one seeks out in order to examine the dynamics of power structures or elaborate cultural symbolism, but they all contain a significant amount of both. The sterile, cold, and bureaucratic Galactic Empire is the British Empire, the Rebellion and the Republic are the United States or its colonial precursors, the Jedi are vaguely Native American, and the Death Star is the Boston Tea Party. You’ve recognized this, I’m sure because it’s shoved in your ears most explicitly by their accents, and less so in your face by aesthetic influences, tactical philosophies, command etiquette, and posture, even. *Solo*’s main character is soaking in American Old Westness, which may or may not have led to its liberal saturation with the themes of individual rights, slavery, and liberation. Regardless, they’re certainly present, and most of them disturbingly for comedic effect.\n\nAs a silent character to the audience, it’s understandable that Chewbacca had too many limitations to occupy a strong second to Han Solo’s lead in the narrative’s eye, and perhaps the relationship between the two as portrayed in the previous films reeked so strongly of servitude that it was an inevitable element when the time came to write them their very own movie. In direct contrast to the firm place of all droids in the social hierarchy of the last 9 movies — addressing humans as “Master,” unapologetically spoken of as property, and traded and/or gifted as such by both protagonists and antagonists, etc. — what we see of Lando and L3 together is a genuinely and complexly affectionate partnership between equals, which *Solo* makes an effort to emphasize, if only to laugh at.\n\nIn response to the forced violence between two drones for spectator sport, L3 is completely enraged, and she cries (among other things) “we are sentient!,” but her distress is trivialized as hysterical distraction (see: *Django Unchained*.) When she suggests to Qi-ra that Lando (who is already illegitimized as a cheating narcissist, and therefore effeminate) is attracted to her, it’s a joke (which many in my audience laughed at) at the expense of her trivialized sexuality. After she triumphs and declares the liberation of her kind to be her true cause, she is immediately destroyed fighting for its sake, yet her ideology is not once acknowledged by her fleshy companions, and her body is quickly gutted for the data on her “central processing unit” as it’s interfaced with the *Falcon*. Granted, Lando *does* thoughtfully muse “she’s part of the ship now” shortly afterward, which would be nice, if you’d forgotten his last words were an outright lie. Lastly, it’s worth noting how apathetic the main characters themselves are toward the Kessel miners, especially as they are packing up to leave, when the camera pans over the chaotic struggle between the liberated and their guards in very close proximity to the awaiting *Falcon*, yet there was not a suggestion that they would even *consider* letting them take refuge from the violence in their very spacious freighter. Aside from Han’s or Qi-ra’s, **Solo treats liberation as charming or amusing, nothing more**.\n\nAnyway, the crown jewel of *Solo* for many fans will probably be the scene of the infamous Kessel Run, when Han Solo and Chewbacca first take the helm(?) of the *Millennium Falcon* with Lando injured and L3 dissected, using her “navigational database” to plot a very risky shortcut around the scary space cloud by the scary space squid and the scary space hole in order to make it to the site of the refinery before the volatile Uranium explodes. Once there, *darn old flakey Lando* fucks the hell of in the *Falcon* right as the Cloud Riders roll up, but *whoa!* their leader is actually a very young woman with freckles! She describes the atrocities of Crimson Dawn and suggests that Han (who’s now the established decisionmaker for whatever reason) give *them* the Uranium in order to establish “the beginning of a rebellion,” which we can safely assume is *The* Rebellion, which does beg one to wonder why Solo never once bragged among the later rebellion about having started the whole thing in the other films, considering that — *whaddya know* — he says yes!\n\nWoody, however, says he’s going to retire upon the news of this decision before immediately reappearing again on Scarred Jarvis’ yacht after he’s revealed to have betrayed the Uranium ruse to him. Qi-ra ends up killing Scarred Jarvis, saving Han, but after promising to follow him and escape, she rings up the late Scarred Jarvis’ boss — a Sith Zabrak who, I would argue, is *not necessarily* Darth Maul, though he probably is — and informs him that her boss is dead and she’s assumed his post. As Han and Woody meet again in an Old West standoff (complete with sand,) the latter insists *one more time* that Qi-ra is not who Han thinks she is (as Jarvis and Qi-ra herself have also said repeatedly,) describing her as “a survivor,” before Han kills him in self-defense.\n\nFinally, after seeing the Cloud Riders off with the Uranium, Han finds Lando once again in a card game — this time taking care to disable his sleight-of-hand device beforehand so that he wins the *Millennium Falcon*, “fair and square,” and we cut to Solo (who seems remarkably upbeat considering the recent betrayal of the lover he’d longed years to reunite with) and Chewie in her cockpit as they tie in that one last knot by declaring their destination, Tatooine, before roaring off into hyperspace, leaving the credit roll in their wake.\n\n\u003e Solo treats liberation as charming or amusing, nothing more.\n\nOver two years ago, I concluded [my first work for *Extratone*](http://bit.ly/wigglecruise) about *The Force Awakens* by arguing that *Star Wars* on the big screen should be allowed to die in favor of investing the time, energy, and funding they require in the pursuit of something new, but the industry still appears to believe that nostalgia is a surer bet where profits are concerned, at least, even after two whole decades of mind-numbing reanimated properties. I didn’t catch *The Last Jedi* until recently, which was remarkably well-done measured against the others as a *Star Wars* movie, but certainly didn’t aim to achieve much more. Clearly, there must be some truth in Hollywood’s cowardice about original properties- especially when it comes to the sort of fantasy armed with potent but unguided emotional bombs that define the *Star Wars* universe, so it wouldn’t make much sense to revive my old diatribe, here. (Though I can assure you that I will be relentless if this horseshit continues for much longer.) *The Force Awakens* and *The Last Jedi*, though, were episodic titles for the family, and these spinoffs that began with *Rogue One* are supposed to be for… well, I’m not entirely sure. In reality, they’ve only moved the proverbial bar up a very wee bit to the family who occasionally says “shit,” because they’re not intellectually stimulating enough to justify themselves as Big Boy-only productions. Or, they wouldn’t be, were they not part of this franchise.\n\nThe truth is, the fans have grown up, and they… *I*… will still buy a ticket for the smallest crumb of hope that a product of this huge machine will be capable of making us feel even a fraction of what we felt as children watching the original films. For me, *The Force Awakens* actually did, once, in that blast of horns before the opening crawl, but it hasn’t happened since, and I should certainly stop expecting or wanting to expect that it will. For others, it’s still working. Though there was a fraction of who I expected to be in attendance with me, they did laugh at a handful of (mostly fascist) moments, and whooped, hollered, and even clapped for a few seconds at the end. I’m surprised opening night wasn’t packed because Portland is the single most nostalgia-addicted culture I’ve ever seen anywhere in the United States. Then again, there *are* a billion theaters here, so perhaps the sample is just lousy. We’ll see how tomorrow and Sunday go, but I’d be surprised if any boxoffice records were broken.\n\nIn the past, when film enthusiasts andfans have described Han Solo as “the best character in *Star Wars*,” they’ve actually been praising his *potential* as a character, not his material itself, and *Solo*’s most effective function as a franchise film was to shut that praise down. Han was not at all denied his movie — *this* is *his* movie — and it provided him the screentime to show us who he truly is and why we *really* like him so much: **he doesn’t fucking change**. The secret to Han Solo’s moral and emotional resiliency is nothing more than halted development. The same old inner conflict between the tough, ruthlessly self-interested persona he does his best to project for everyone around him and the consistent reality of his soft insides was presented in his first scene way back in 1977, and we’re now sure that he was unable to make *any* progress toward its resolution despite openly and obviously brooding over it for an entire lifetime: from at least as early as his young adulthood in this film until his death at the hands of his little Sith son. *There is 0 variation*. He *always* comes back for the cause at the crucial moment after declaring himself through with it. Without fail, he’ll sacrifice the entirety of any self-making enterprise for just about any underdog with a problem who crosses his path. (Which probably explains his constantly-fleeting success as a smuggler well into gray hair and jowls.) *Solo* is abundantly clear about Han’s true nature and very willing to expose how uninteresting it is. When he first proclaims to Qi-ra that he’s become “an outlaw,” she shuts him down with the film’s ultimate quote, insisting that she “knows who [he] *really* is: *the good guy.*”\n\nIf the video game-despising fans will bear with me for a moment, it’s worth noting that Bioware’s *Star Wars: The Old Republic* MMORPG is the most interesting and extensive source of nuanced narrative in the IP (it holds the world record for the largest voiceover project ever produced,) and most of it can now be experienced without actually playing the game. Like *Solo*, it’s set pre-saga, but considerably before — a few centuries, if I remember correctly, which gave the writers a gigantic opportunity to both expand and predestine the universe. There are eight different class stories with around 50 cumulative hours of dialog, each. A few are relatively unimaginative, but the majority are complex, exciting, emotionally-involved tales that create very rich characters, and all of them can be streamed in their entirety on YouTube. If you are willing to see the potential of a Han Solo-like character fulfilled in a different medium, the [Smuggler class story](http://bit.ly/torsmuggler) is a pretty damned engaging exploration of the *kind outlaw with conflicted identity issues* angle.\n\nFrom my perspective, *Solo*’s frequent less-than-subtle maltreatment of some very brutal and sensitive power relationships makes it the most toxic of the *Star Wars* films yet, and I assume it ended up that way, unnecessarily because Ron Howard is an all-American son of a bitch. If these titles are going to continue to be passed around between bigwhig directors, future unpleasantries are inevitable. Notably, I’ve yet to see any mention of these disturbing themes from the respectable authorities of the film criticism establishment, who’ve been overwhelmingly [charmed](https://www.newyorker.com/culture/richard-brody/wookiee-nights-solo-a-star-wars-story-reviewed) by *Solo*’s nostalgia. Take from that whatever you will.\n\nIf we continue to love the character Han Solo, it’ll be in the same way we love our earnest, foolish, emotionally-stunted manchild fathers who’s developmental inadequacies are often embarrassing, sometimes abusive, and thoroughly pitiful. *Solo* leaves no more room for an idealized, elegant perception of this character — he’s no more than a *pretty good guy* with a lifelong addiction to thrill-seeking and a shitload of luck.\n\nTo declare unequivocally whether or not *Solo: A Star Wars Story* is worth a trip the cinema with your date, your children, or just your own damned conscience would require me to disregard a whole host of complicating factors, but if you’ve stuck it this far with me, you’d have a lot to disregard yourself to jump in. I’d advise that parents watch it themselves before deciding whether or not it’s something worth adding to your child’s life. Of those of you like me who’ll tow the line despite what you know and watch a *Star Wars* film alone on opening night in delirium hoping for just a drop from the Fountain of Youth, I would ask: how long are we really going to keep kidding ourselves?\n\n#film","tags":["film"],"images":["https://i.snap.as/6UghZsm.jpeg"],"paid":false,"views":859,"collection":{"alias":"extratone","title":"Extratone","description":"For the New Curious.","style_sheet":"","public":true,"views":125790,"domain":"extratone.com","email":"extratone-p5beoxe3onlcm8o6jcrvwl@writeas.com","url":"https://extratone.com/","monetization_pointer":"","total_posts":0}},{"id":"m2vgt85qbdhoyyno","slug":"brand","appearance":"norm","language":"en","rtl":false,"type":"post","created":"2018-05-18T07:30:00Z","updated":"2020-06-19T07:35:02Z","title":"Brand","body":"![Extratone Brand Preview](https://i.snap.as/Ee30Mig.jpg)\n\n## Download Extratone logos and other image assets.\n\n[**Extratone Brand Kit 2020**](https://www.dropbox.com/s/i9jpdyna0z0hdx1/Extratone%20Brand%20Kit.zip)","tags":[],"images":["https://i.snap.as/Ee30Mig.jpg"],"paid":false,"views":369,"collection":{"alias":"extratone","title":"Extratone","description":"For the New Curious.","style_sheet":"","public":true,"views":125790,"domain":"extratone.com","email":"extratone-p5beoxe3onlcm8o6jcrvwl@writeas.com","url":"https://extratone.com/","monetization_pointer":"","total_posts":0}},{"id":"8mggcfbj15189r2r","slug":"mom-and-dad-film-review","appearance":"norm","language":"en","rtl":false,"type":"post","created":"2018-02-17T06:59:13Z","updated":"2020-04-30T08:13:07Z","title":"‘Mom and Dad’’s Discrepant Defense Against Stale Industry and the Population Problem","body":"## A 'fun' movie\n\n#### by [David Blue](http://twitter.com/neoyokel)\n\n![Nicolas Cage](https://i.snap.as/HitpxbS.jpeg)\n\nThe Earth will reach its maximum occupancy load (12 billion) when I am in my mid-fifities, meaning there’ll be more than twice as many gorging, shitting, shooting, complaining, and lying human beings than there were when I started, and perhaps Brian Taylor’s *Mom and Dad* is in fact a reasoned argument for a particular solution to our inevitable plight. I’m still not sure what a “cult” movie is, precisely, but I can’t imagine what sort of cult could possibly sustain itself around the ethos of this film alone, despite its concise, agitating, at once lighthearted, yet genuinely-disturbing trip. No, it is probably not propaganda. From the experts, you’ll get *precisely* the same review, varying only in length. *The New York Times*’ Glenn Kenny [couldn’t be bothered](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/18/movies/mom-and-dad-review-nicolas-cage.html) with more than 250 words, but RogerEbert dot com’s Simon Abrams [shelled out a whole 1000](https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/mom-and-dad-2018). They are suspiciously close to these big round numbers — perhaps each was written to respective quotas, and perhaps you could say all that could reasonably be said in 10, but I don’t care.\n\nThe tropes here are polished to a miraculous sheen — two emotionally-stunted, middleaged, overly preoccupied-with-their-lost-youth suburban parents (Nicolas Cage and Selma Blair) who’s existing envies \u0026 irritations regarding their own classically bratty teenage girl (Anne Winters) and her mischievous little brother (Zackary Arthur) is merely agitated by a sudden TV static-bound killer instinct into bloodlust, not originated. I’m not sure any pill dealer would actually flip off their customers after a fair buy — even in high school, but *drugs*, a *black boyfriend*, and a *stinkbomb*? in the old Trans Am!? *I’m going to kill you!*\n\nSomebody, somewhere knew all the best sources on suburbia and how to put them to good use. The Camry, the golf bag, ping pong smashing, sweat-stained Big Sur tee, and *Dr. Oz*, for Christ’s sake! Granted, talking to your girlfriend/boyfriend on the phone at all is a bit dated — especially while riding a BMX — and I don’t think Froot Loops are generally accepted middle-class chow anymore. These are staples from *my* youth, and I am very old. Technically, the iMessage bubble graphics are more chronographically appropriate, but with great consequence, I fear — if we’re going to accept them once and for all as authentic mechanisms for telling stories set in the present, they are going to age faster than Nick’s new jowls (unless we’re all soon killed by our parents.) It’s been two years since I knew anything about music, but I seriously doubt even the gothest fifteen?-year-old girls are listening to [Father-esque post-Memphis horrorcore](https://soundcloud.com/billsaberdotcom/iknowupussiesdontwantit) in class — there’s something about SoundCloud that really clashes with chokers.\n\n\u003ciframe width=\"100%\" height=\"300\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" allow=\"autoplay\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/273824044\u0026color=%2300006b\u0026auto_play=false\u0026hide_related=false\u0026show_comments=true\u0026show_user=true\u0026show_reposts=false\u0026show_teaser=true\u0026visual=true\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"font-size: 10px; color: #cccccc;line-break: anywhere;word-break: normal;overflow: hidden;white-space: nowrap;text-overflow: ellipsis; font-family: Interstate,Lucida Grande,Lucida Sans Unicode,Lucida Sans,Garuda,Verdana,Tahoma,sans-serif;font-weight: 100;\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://soundcloud.com/thebillsaber\" title=\"BILL $ABER\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: #cccccc; text-decoration: none;\"\u003eBILL $ABER\u003c/a\u003e · \u003ca href=\"https://soundcloud.com/thebillsaber/iknowupussiesdontwantit\" title=\"I KNOW THAT YOU PUSSIES DONT WANT IT Prod The Virus And Antidote\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: #cccccc; text-decoration: none;\"\u003eI KNOW THAT YOU PUSSIES DONT WANT IT Prod The Virus And Antidote\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\nIf there was ever a film in which to use grimy dubstep-influenced electronic slaps, buzzes, chirps, and great grating clanking, it’s this one. It’s a terrific disappointment that Hollywood feels so timidly about their use of the most intimate medium. One forgets its potential to control the nuances of an audience’s fear, anger, discomfort, and panic beyond cheap jump scares until they experience an irritating, distressing, ghastly gross, all-possessing feat of accentuating audio production such as that of *Mom and Dad*. If you want to judge Academically the *effectiveness* of a nominee’s work for an award with a title like Best Sound Editing (as opposed to whatever the hell criteria was met most fully by *Skyfall*,) you *must* give the little golden man to these folks, whoever they are.\n\n![Mom \u0026 Dad Sound Department](https://i.snap.as/CQm0cIN.png)\n\nWhen’s the last time you saw a truly, believably shitty modern parental pair on a big screen? I really can’t remember, myself. Brent and Kendall Ryan are masterpieces of character craft — both a perfect précis *and* thoroughly-defined exploration of miserable white suburbanites. They’re even *named* unimprovably, which reflects a quality in care and attention to detail that I very much appreciate. They are vain, vulgar, impatient, selfishly afraid, and careless, freely feeling and saying it all directly in front of their children. I love being told explicitly which characters to hate (no joke,) and in this case it’s the whole damned lot. Brian Taylor and Nicolas Cage [scream](https://youtu.be/MSmJFMabfJc) it over and over (as I’d like to imagine) a single afternoon of one-take filming, considering that the latter took it upon himself to first [memorize the entire screenplay](http://comicbook.com/horror/2018/01/08/nicolas-cage-mom-and-dad-movie-brian-taylor/) and its prose, vanilla to perfection, before photography began, and I hope it all stays with him forever, especially “my mom is such a penis.”\n\n*Mom and Dad* could conceivably be Nicolas Cage’s *I Am Legend* if for no other reason than the total lack of possible stand-ins for Brent Ryan — even the standard by which all white suburban Dad performances have been measured in the 21st century, Jason Bateman. Nick himself [described ](http://variety.com/video/mom-and-dad-toronto-film-festival-nicolas-cage/)it as “punk rock, rebellious, irreverent, original, badass,” and the “number one” movie he’s made in the past ten years (disqualifying *National Treasure*, in case you were worried.) No surprise, I must agree — this one is a wonderfully raucous and feral thing, but the scene involving the attempted murder of a newborn by her mother (Kendall’s sister) came very close to crossing the line. However, I am old and the intensity of my paternal instincts has probably outpaced my understanding of them. You could also argue, of course, that pushing such boundaries is a core function of a film like *Mom and Dad.* Nobody ended up vomiting or anything.\n\nThis *fun* thing shouldn’t feel as foreign as it does in cinema, but you already knew that. With all its implicit grapples with overpopulation, kids and gun violence, class, and racism — truly, this is a film charged electrically with current issues. Or maybe not. Ultimately, I can at least tell you for certain that Brian Taylor made exponentially better use of his resources (I couldn’t find a solid number for its production budget) than the Fucking Spierig Brothers did with *Winchester* (just so you know what a disaster looks like,) and managed to be refreshingly original (astonishing that nobody’s had this specific idea before.) A spectacular riot, *Mom and Dad* does all you could possibly want it to do. With just eighty-three minutes to lose, it’s worth the commitment just to hear Nicolas Cage whimper and say “anal beads.”\n\n#film","tags":["cccccc","film"],"images":["https://i.snap.as/HitpxbS.jpeg","https://i.snap.as/CQm0cIN.png"],"paid":false,"views":655,"collection":{"alias":"extratone","title":"Extratone","description":"For the New Curious.","style_sheet":"","public":true,"views":125790,"domain":"extratone.com","email":"extratone-p5beoxe3onlcm8o6jcrvwl@writeas.com","url":"https://extratone.com/","monetization_pointer":"","total_posts":0}},{"id":"2xg2oznt68qw7g2r","slug":"three-billboards-outside-ebbing-missouri-review","appearance":"norm","language":"en","rtl":false,"type":null,"created":"2018-01-26T19:00:00Z","updated":"2020-05-01T03:12:37Z","title":"Three Billboards Outside Silva, North Carolina","body":"#### by [David Blue](http://twitter.com/neoyokel)\n\n![Three Billboards](https://i.snap.as/C271IoF.jpeg)\n\n## Nitpicking the recklessness of last year’s highly-awarded, class-blind black comedy\n\nIndeed, it may be the time to jab at the rural, working-class South, but Martin McDonagh [claims](http://www.slashfilm.com/martin-mcdonagh-interview/) to have written his Golden Orb Special “eight years ago,” long before Tump, and any critical resolution the film provides is argued haphazardly. Consequently, its eye is cast on this strange, satirical portrayal of the Midwest in a manner which is inaccurate and insensitive enough to irk this Missourian. When I saw it at Columbia’s Ragtag Cinema this week, it was introduced by a young employee who noted that 1) Ebbing, Missouri is not a real place, 2) the film was actually shot in one of the Carolinas (an audience member suggested incorrectly that it was in SC,) and 3) we should prepare ourselves to be roused a bit by a bar scene in which a character pays $8 for two beers because “that just wouldn’t happen” (the Ragtag also serves alcohol.)\n\nThe “redemption arc” of the racist “hick” “loser” Officer Dixon (Sam Rockwell) was rightfully [at the center](https://www.vox.com/2018/1/19/16878018/three-billboards-controversy-racist-sam-rockwell-redemption-flannery-oconnor) of the film’s controversy, but even if one imagines his role and fate written differently — perhaps with him irrecoverably shunned and/or visibly punished for his excessive, hateful violence — his rubishness would still be unforgivable. Living with his mother and turtle feels like an effort to humanize him — and, by extension, racist small-town cops as a whole. *The Huffington Post*’s [Zeba Blay](https://twitter.com/zblay) wrote an essential take on why *Three Billboards* — with its terrifyingly racist dork — was received the way it was.\n\n\u003e Rockwell’s character is the racist uncle whom white liberals fear and love. The ability to feel for him ― to root for him in spite of his past transgressions, because he really is a “good man at heart,” an idiot who doesn’t know any better ― offers a kind of catharsis for the white viewer who can’t or won’t deal with true nuance, who is unable to reconcile their own complicity with their desire to be “good.”\n\nIt’s not as if the film isn’t technically well executed or refreshing — thanks in large part, yes, to Frances McDormand — or that I will not regret appealing on behalf of my home state, but it’s hard not to speak up when Hollywood shits so recklessly on my people. I don’t much like writing about movies because there are so many voices who consistently speak so much more effectively. NPR’s *Pop Culture Happy Hour*, for instance, did a wonderful job [dissecting](https://www.npr.org/sections/monkeysee/2017/12/01/567291457/pop-culture-happy-hour-revenge-redemption-and-three-billboards) the film’s depictions of racism and domestic violence. [Gene Demby](https://twitter.com/GeeDee215) commented that “[McDonagh] doesn’t get these particular physics of American racism, and he’s not interested in them,” and I think it’s reasonable to suggest that Mark’s not very versed or interested in the physics of American class, either.\n\nIf you must differentiate the state of Missouri as a cultural whole between North and South, it is currently more red than blue — we went [56% for Donald and 38% for Hillary](http://enrarchives.sos.mo.gov/enrnet/) — but ask anyone from “somewhere down in the Georgia, Florida, Alabama corner” — as McDonagh put it -where we generally fall, and they’d be unlikely to regard us, fraternally, as the same part of the country. The accents in *Three Billboards* are not among the wide variety of local dialects you’ll encounter anywhere in the state, but perhaps they wouldn’t be out of place in Sylva, North Carolina, where the film was [actually shot](http://wlos.com/news/local/big-movie-comes-to-sylva-shooting-dates-for-three-billboards).\n\nRegardless of all potential criticism of the film’s cultural perspective or technical excellence — and I think most of it is more valid than any take I could possibly offer — my particular issue with it comes from a culmination of tasteless decisions. If one reasonably successful Irish director were to produce a patronizing film at the expense of Missouri’s working class filled with a ton of absurd, misconstrued characters portrayed by A-list talent *on location* in a real Missouri town, the side-effectual economic benefits such a production delivers to a locale would make it all more forgivable. *Say what you want about us… as long as you’re paying*. But to photograph such a film completely separate Missouri — culturally and financially — set in a fictional(ized) town, *include the state’s name in its title*, before conducting oneself in interviews as if we were a random target on a “Southern” dartboard… Well, that’s awfully shitty.\n\n*Boy, working class Americans sure are a riot!*\n\nThe writing is interesting enough for this, totally-out-of-touch“reviewer,” but I can’t imagine why it won Best Screenplay at the Globes, unless the other nominees were completely, bleakly predictable. (I wouldn’t know.) The excerpt below (**\u003cu\u003eSPOILER WARNING I GUESS? LOL\u003c/u\u003e**) was the most stirring part of the experience, personally, if only because I really like films that palm strike one in the face without warning with bizarre, chaotic vulgarity (like the elevator scene in *Drive*.)\n\nI suppose it could have been the result of a rational decision to give *any* depth to Anne (Abbie Cornish) — who is Chief Willoughby’s (Woody Fucking Harrelson) Australian?, much-too-attractive wife — before he kills himself in the last third of the movie, making her suddenly relevant. Or, perhaps it was another attempt to emphasize the emotional repression of “Southern” folks — one of the almost-accurate positives of the film, if only thanks to McDormand’s skill. She and Sam Rockwell won Best Actress and Best Actor in a Supporting Role, respectively, which makes sense — it’s a shame they accepted such an out-of-touch work with which to demonstrate their ability to assume aloof, emotionally-dysfunctional characters.\n\nGrowing up astride classe while traveling throughout the vast majority of Missouri for various reasons has made me defensive, and — while my right to speak for hard-working Midwesterners is certainly debatable -I’d suggest the industry at large be more diligently interested when setting is especially emphasized. It is no longer acceptable to pass up the opportunities McDonagh has for critical storytelling in *Three Billboards*. Racist cops, abusive spouses, unsolved murders, and mishandled grief are real, abundant issues in the country’s breadbasket, and they’re worth discussing responsibly — especially with such a powerful platform. If the purpose of film writing is to help an audience determine whether or not a work is worth spending their time and money to see it in theaters or otherwise, I can tell you — even within my bias and limited authority -that this one just… isn’t.\n\n#film #class","tags":["film","class"],"images":["https://i.snap.as/C271IoF.jpeg"],"paid":false,"views":774,"collection":{"alias":"extratone","title":"Extratone","description":"For the New Curious.","style_sheet":"","public":true,"views":125790,"domain":"extratone.com","email":"extratone-p5beoxe3onlcm8o6jcrvwl@writeas.com","url":"https://extratone.com/","monetization_pointer":"","total_posts":0}},{"id":"tzyrmmzy7r9djb1c","slug":"contact","appearance":"sans","language":"en","rtl":false,"type":null,"created":"2017-12-26T11:00:00Z","updated":"2020-05-20T18:39:04Z","title":"Contact","body":"![Xerox Boys](https://i.snap.as/au04hL0.jpg)\n\n\u003c!--emailsub--\u003e\n\n## GOT SOMETHING TO SAY? *We're all ears*.\n\n### \u003cu\u003eEMAIL\u003c/u\u003e\nPitches, tips, and related correspondence can be sent to [horn@extratone dot com](mailto:horn@extratone.com).\n\n### ⟿⟿ Follow [our Telegram channel](http://t.me/extratone).\n\nDM us on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/extratone), like our [Facebook page](http://facebook.com/extratonemagazine), and/or cyberbully our [Instagram](http://extratone.com/instagram).\n\nOur [public Discord](http://bit.ly/holeguest) is always open and monitored.\n\nIf all else fails, Grandma and Grandpa can call us up on the telephone: **+1 (573) 826-4160**\n\n------\n\n\u003ciframe src=\"https://discordapp.com/widget?id=107272441889341440\u0026theme=light\" width=\"320\" height=\"425\" align=\"center\" allowtransparency=\"true\" frameborder=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e","tags":[],"images":["https://i.snap.as/au04hL0.jpg"],"paid":false,"views":4110,"collection":{"alias":"extratone","title":"Extratone","description":"For the New Curious.","style_sheet":"","public":true,"views":125790,"domain":"extratone.com","email":"extratone-p5beoxe3onlcm8o6jcrvwl@writeas.com","url":"https://extratone.com/","monetization_pointer":"","total_posts":0}},{"id":"8nmn3425493n0ybl","slug":"virtual-reality-experience-gaming-future","appearance":"norm","language":"en","rtl":false,"type":null,"created":"2017-10-07T08:00:00Z","updated":"2019-05-26T19:01:41Z","title":"Virtual Reality Virginity, Lost","body":"#### by [David Blue](http://twitter.com/neoyokel)\n\n![VR Virgin](https://i.snap.as/4LDha0S.jpg)\n\n## A late geezer’s first go at the dystopian VR experience\n\nEarlier this year, [Tim](http://extratone.com/cactus) and I had the opportunity to try virtual reality at the [True/False Film Festival](http://www.extratone.com/truefalse/) in a dark, curtained side room of a commandeered Columbia art gallery, but we were both much too intoxicated and loopy those last few hours of the fest, and we bailed. Call us cowards if you must — *immersion* can be a scary concept to those of us who grew up reading science fiction, before the existence of the modern video game console. I’ve wanted just 30 seconds or so with a pair of goggles, just to have an idea of what the increasing number of Oculus-blinded pedestrians surrounding me are looking at. Thanks to Isiah, I was finally caught up last night with a few VR YouTube videos and *Farpoint*’s introduction on a PlayStation 4.\n\nFirst, Isiah brings me the headset and describes in detail how exactly to adjust it, but I forget it all and simply try to shove it directly and violently on my face. Eventually, he takes it back and simply mounts and adjusts it around my monstrous skull — like you would for a toddler — and I lay eyes on the console for the first time. For whatever reason, it never occurred to me that general GUI wouldn’t simply be displayed in 2D, but by a literal *virtual display*, layed out in front of me like a large, floor-mounted touch workstation. I’m astonished by my ability to turn away from it to look at the rest of *Goggleworld*, which is nothing but a deeply black void.\n\nFrom my previous world, I hear Isiah and Hawthorn discussing what to show me first, and YouTube is the settled-upon environment. As the application is restarted in “VR Mode,” its startup screen is what *really* establishes the truth — I have *gone virtual*. I cannot use my hands to shield my eyes from the branding’s glaring watermark and terrifying red light. At its home menu, Isiah simply selects the “VR” tab, revealing a selection of thumbnails for algorithmically-recommended VR-shot videos on the service.\n\nTo begin, I am mounted on the tail of a superbike as it’s raced around an American desert circuit. It takes a few seconds for high resolution to buffer, leaving me briefly in a pixelized hell that would surely make anyone sick, were they exposed very long. (I was especially excited to become nauseous, to no avail.) At the getgo, I am occupied with the rider’s butt since it’s center-frame if I stand in my usual posture. Isiah points out the hovering HUD to my left containing a selection of simulated digital instruments (tachometer, 7-segment speedo, etc.) Its presence would suggest that the purpose of my virtual passengership is to witness the lap as a motorsport enthusiast, but the rear of the rider obscures most of my view forward — I cannot admire his line as one would viewing a GoPro-or-otherwise POV of the same event, so I decide to try and figure out which track I am hurried through. Though the vehicle is tossed about in the required movements of motorbike operation, I myself (the VR capture device) am impressively gyrostabilized, and the image, static, as if I’m *actually* hovering above the pair as they moved along. I spin left and right, spotting a small gaggle of miniature wind turbines and two wilting hilltop trees in the foreground. Behind them, small sand dunes fill the space, all the way to the horizon.\n\nAfter a few minutes, I am finally relieved early of my cutless lap for a short *National Geographic* documentary on a Viking revival festival in Poland. I’m introduced to its Big Boys by a series of aerial shots (presumably by drone, which is awfully un-Vikinglike) as they row their Big Boat up(?) a relatively wide, tree-lined river. In contrast with the lap, the jump cuts become a bit disorienting — I am eventually jumped *in* the boat for a moment, next to the sweaty, bearded lads — a few of whom are shirtless. I notice a blurry church on the distant bank. Suddenly, I float briskly across the small no man’s land between two rapidly advancing battle lines of Nordic Nerds with real, era-specific weapons and way too much free time. More lingering drone shots follow from just a few feet above the ensuing conflict. Outside, Isiah confirms Hawthorn’s suggestion that this is, indeed, *the one where they use real weapons* as I notice a pile of three or four men lying against each other, motionless on the ground, right-of-center in the nearest line, and mull over the sure disturbance of all this immersion the festival has allowed in welcoming the presence of the surely-buzzing drone. *I guess they’re dead*.\n\nAfter the conflict, I am subjected to a dreamier, narrated montage accompanied by cheesy synthesized orchestral music and featuring disproportionately a particular man with a shiny, tatted bald head and rather large feet with rather small toes, which he likes to wiggle during these particular conversations. Thanks to VR’s omniencompassing perspective, I am allowed to observe his wiggling in his every appearance. The tone of the background music and the prevalence of relaxed, conversing couples and sunsets in the scenes suggest romanticism is the montage’s theme, but for me, it is the bald man’s feet — I am too busy conversing with my two friends, across the divide, in this world, to listen to any of what is said. Considering that YouTube collects the dimensional data regarding where the user looks, and for how long, I make an effort to bend my neck up and down in extremes, and notice a patch of washed-out sky, distorting in the distance, and ponder what — if anything — we have gained in this technology.\n\n![VR Vertical](https://i.snap.as/ihtaDMF.jpg)\n\nDoes an increase in the raw amount of visual data available to the viewer actually make motion picture storytelling more effective? In the few minutes of my VR taste test, I *did* gain quite a bit of volition over an equivalent 2D experience, but it didn’t seem like I’d instinctively used it to gain much else. If one is specifically interested in the shrubbery around a racetrack, or the more nuanced undulations of a Viking’s foot, they can more likely than not find a standard video on the World Wide Web that would more efficiently entertain them. In specific situations, of course, a producer can undoubtedly benefit by the ability to capture in 360 degrees, but — in any sort of cinema, especially — it seems unnecessarily sacrificial to relinquish entirely the narrative directorial control of shot framing to their audience. However, I am the antiexpert on this subject, obviously. My take on the viability of VR is Virtually Redundant and — quite possibly — very wrong, but my time in its hell is not over yet.\n\nIsiah explains that it is time for me to *game*, and asks if I’d like to try “the one with the hands, or the one with the gun.” As always, I choose the firearm, as the “hands” have not been found yet and the hypothetical image immediately offered up by my imagination is of rusty iron shackles. The Infinite Blackness has returned, and I cannot see beyond it to determine what my host is up to. Then, it becomes outer space — filling with thousands of starlike white dots. The light-blue outline of a virtual PlayStation controller appears where I assume him to be, unattached and bumbling about. Soon, it jaggedly approaches, and I feel him hand it to me. We have started its calibration process, which becomes a bit frightening in my celestial surroundings, though at least I have now gained participatory power over my new existence. I’d opted out of wearing headphones, so the assistant’s malignant-sounding female British voice comes softly from the television somewhere in front of me as I point the beam of light the controller’s representation is now projecting straight forward at the navigational arrows displayed ahead and pull “the trigger” (R2.)\n\nI am pleased by the idea of interfacing with software exclusively by shooting it repeatedly before I am abruptly contained in a cage, now being projected by a virtualization of the system’s sensor, which is unsettling. I am now calibrating the hardware contained within the physical device that captures the position of my body in the physical world. I catch the word “confinement” in the assistant’s unending, otherwise-inaudible directions, and quicken my pace. When it’s all done, I return the controller to Isiah, who reboots the PS4, itself, before launching *Farpoint*. My space becomes a lighter blue and fills with little opaque bits of Sony Dust for a minute or two. Isiah continues his rummaging for another peripheral as the title’s introduction begins to play.\n\nTwo rather poorly-animated astronauts are co-hosting a live broadcast from their craft, which is presented in a dramatization of a computer display. They’ve just met, but they’re both stacked with academia, co-massaging their knowledge, which I choose not to listen to. Out of view, Isiah unsuccessfully attempts to skip the whole thing before I’m allowed to become *virtual* again — this time, atop the animated body of another astronaut in a lone shuttle, approaching the mothership where it holds, next to a large, very-*Star Trek* “anomaly.” From Deep Space Nine, the two scientists continue to bicker over comms as I look around the cockpit. Looking backwards has already become a favorite habit of mine — I wonder where the shuttle’s bathroom is. For whatever reason, the back of my character’s neck was animated, though it can only be seen by looking rearwards and down, which distorts its shape into something truly terrifying.\n\nA bunch of unrelated plot follows, leading me to end up on a foreign world, exiting my crashed escape pod. By now, Isiah has connected *The Gun*, but something about it isn’t quite right — my character holds it in a glitched, very uncomfortable-looking manner, and it’s suspected that a fix would require a restart, and therefore — a replay of the introductory cutscene — so I retire out of lack of patience.\n\nIf I were confidently reviewing PlayStation VR as a consumer purchase, I’d cite a quote of Isiah’s: “I couldn’t find the thing.” In addition to my first drone sighting, a few days ago in Colorado, this lost virtual virginity is not necessarily unwelcome — I feel as though I’ve acquired a platform to better ponder the dystopia to which these and their like industries add a certain comic spice. That said, I cannot imagine a reason to once again enter the digital realm — and *who cares*?\n\nPlease enjoy your new worlds, kids.\n\n#spectacle #tech #gaming #portland","tags":["gaming","portland","spectacle","tech"],"images":["https://i.snap.as/4LDha0S.jpg","https://i.snap.as/ihtaDMF.jpg"],"paid":false,"views":581,"collection":{"alias":"extratone","title":"Extratone","description":"For the New Curious.","style_sheet":"","public":true,"views":125790,"domain":"extratone.com","email":"extratone-p5beoxe3onlcm8o6jcrvwl@writeas.com","url":"https://extratone.com/","monetization_pointer":"","total_posts":0}},{"id":"19tqa5tqngbaf7sc","slug":"about","appearance":"norm","language":"en","rtl":false,"type":null,"created":"2017-05-18T09:00:00Z","updated":"2020-04-26T04:49:02Z","title":"About","body":"![Duga 3](https://i.snap.as/SYiu70i.jpg)\n\n## *Extratone* is sustained by an ongoing passion for New Culture and a duty to further its voices. \n\nLaunched on May 18th, 2016, *Extratone* is an online magazine covering technology, music, culture, and media from an exclusively-youthful perspective.

We spoke to him just hours before it became a global tech conversation.\n\nThe saga of Twitter, Inc. has been rejuvenated in 2017 by Tump's antics, corporate drama, and an amalgam of user and non-user disquiet with its decisions, though its financial viability has been in prominent industry conversation for half a decade. Since its pre-2010 outset, many 'a' feature has accumulated on its original, still-iconic skeletal software, and - though the net is undoubtedly positive - a few have gone.\n\nLast Thursday, the company revised in bravado its poultrian default profile picture and its system of replies to exclude @s on all of Twitter's proprietary services, drastically changing two of its visual mainstays, and prodding a particularly lucent cacophony. Turn your ear, and you'll hear many familiar terms in the chants: *limits, chains, strings, harassment, feedback, gamergate, nazis, etc.*\n\nThese conversations are important, but they've gotten awfully stale.\n\nIf you listen a bit more carefully, you'll intercept a new one:\n\n*Mastodon*.\n\nIt's the open source brainchild of Eugen Rochko, who's known colloquially as [Gargron](https://web.archive.org/web/20170407072251/https://mastodon.social/@Gargron).\n\nHe's had one hell of a week.\n\nBetween the night of our first emails and our conversation, his flagship [mastadon.social](https://web.archive.org/web/20170407072251/http://mastodon.social/) instance had doubled in users. Less than two hours after we said our goodbyes, his name was on *The Verge*'s front page.\n\nDespite the urgency of it all, he graciously lent me his time just after breakfast on Tuesday to discuss himself and the story behind the project, while the most significant day of his life was building around him.\n\n\"I'm perfectly fine with being called *Eugene* by Americans.\"\n\nThough the ink's still fresh on his compsci diploma, he's clearly prepared for the American press.\n\n\u003ciframe src=\"https://anchor.fm/davidblue/embed/episodes/Mastodons-Big-Moment--20-Months-Later-e2iq20/a-a6ia3l\" height=\"102px\" width=\"400px\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\n------\n\n**What's the story behind the project? Do you remember the specific moment when you decided to do this?**\n\nMany years ago, I had a friend that was really into federated networks when they were a new thing. That was when [identi.ca](https://web.archive.org/web/20170407072251/http://identi.ca/) was first created - at the very beginning of my developer knowledge and career.\n\nA good portion of the stories written so far on his platform have framed it as an alternative to Twitter, which early Masto adopters refer to as \"Hellbird,\" or \"the bird website.\" Eugen isn't afraid to acknowledge his investment in the format.\n\nI was a heavy Twitter user and I wasn't happy with where Twitter was going, so I decided to check on how the federated stuff was doing in the meantime. I found it in a very sad state, but thought I could contribute.\n\nHe began building on his own, with Tweetdeck's standard in mind.\n\n\u003e I thought 'if I'm going to do something, it needs to have realtime updates and it needs to have columns.' I started with a bare-bones prototype while still [at University] in May or April of last year. It had no user interface, only an API that I was using from the command line. And I thought 'okay, it works. that's great.' Then, exams came.\n\nAcademics had to come before the project at first, but it soon supplied an ample post-graduation diversion. He focused his energy on building something more complete and eventually launched a [Patreon page](https://web.archive.org/web/20170407072251/https://www.patreon.com/user?u=619786).\n\n\u003e I [announced](https://web.archive.org/web/20170407072251/https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=13303346) it on HackerNews, and that was the first public release of the project. That's when I got my first users who weren't my friends, and some who were new to federated networks.\n\nThat was just over 100 days ago, and it gave way to his first feedback.\n\n\u003e I started working on the first feature requests, shaping the project a bit differently. People were a lot more focused on privacy features than I thought they would be, although in retrospect, it makes sense. The previous [federated] project - GNU social - did not really have a focus on privacy features, or anything built in by default.\n\nIt compelled him to change things, and his work was well received.\n\n\u003e Over time, I kept working on new features, and waves of new users came when it went viral in certain circles. The first was HackerNews and Product Hunt. [Aral Balkan](https://web.archive.org/web/20170407072251/https://twitter.com/aral) - a Twitter user with over 30,000 followers - picked up the project, gave it a shout out, and even did a giveaway of his app. He had a lot of followers from Holland; the Mastodon timelines became mostly Dutch.\n\nNext was Marxist anime Twitter (including *[Extratone](http://mastodon.social/@extratone)* and [I](http://bit.ly/dbmastodon).)\n\nLots of furries; lots of LGBT people. That's when I really focused on privacy features and making sure all blocks worked because these individuals needed a safer platform than Twitter could offer.\n\n![Sidekick dashboard background processing jobs as of Tuesday morning.](https://i.snap.as/0bAIHB6.png)\n\n*Sidekick dashboard background processing jobs as of Tuesday morning.*\n\n\"As you can see, the first bump is HackerNews, the second is Aral Balkan, and then anime/Marxist Twitter.\"\n\nAnd the last - now a bit out of date - is this week's spike, which is nearly double all previous waves.\n\n**Are you responsible for all of the code?**\n\nYou can look at the [GitHub page](https://web.archive.org/web/20170407072251/https://github.com/tootsuite/mastodon) to see a specific breakdown of who contributed and how many lines of code, each. You'll see I'm at the top by a large margin, but there are [additional] people who've contributed interesting, good features \u0026 fixes, localizations, user guides, and documentation.\n\n**What's the story behind the name?**\n\nIt's not particularly interesting. I'm a progressive metal fan, and I listen to *Mastodon* sometimes. They have a really cool name that refers to a really cool animal. It's a fluffy elephant! What's not to love?\n\nIt's also the inspiration for Mastodon's mascot, which was penned by Rochko's YouTuber friend [Dopatwo](https://web.archive.org/web/20170407072251/https://www.youtube.com/user/dopatwo) after he realized how urgently he required an error page.\n\n**What does \"federated\" mean to you?**\n\nThe biggest problem with this term is that it's new for lots of people. People who've come across federated networks in the past*instantly* understand what it means and how it works, and people who are new to the concept have a lot of trouble before it clicks. But when Twitter first started, people didn't understand what 'retweeting' meant, so it's not a unique problem domain.\n\nI don't know where it comes from - maybe BitTorrent - but people seem to think that when something is 'decentralized,' everybody gets the same thing; that it's all synchronized one to one. In actuality, 'federated' means that people in different instances can *talk* to each other, but the *content* is different depending on the users there, what they do, and who they follow.\n\nThough instances are infrastructurally independent, they can communicate with one another. On a user level, timelines are still determined by who you do and do not follow across the entirety of all instances. \n\n**What if Twitter comes to you in the near future with a job offer?**\n\n[Rochko laughs.]\nIf it was any other company, I would think about it. A job is a staple source of income, and - depending on the company - could involve doing something important, but I have zero faith in Twitter.\n\n**Does this all mean that I finally get to live out my serif Twitter dream?**\n\nYes, I suppose on your own instance, you could change the stylesheet...\n\n**So if I set up my own instance and started charging for its use, I'd be in the clear, legally?**\n\nYes, that's okay. The code is licensed under [AGPL](https://web.archive.org/web/20170407072251/https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.html) version three, which I picked because other projects in the same space are using it. The difference between AGPL and GPL is that [the former] forces you to contribute back to the appstream code repository if you make any breaking changes.\n\nFor example, Eugen explained that WhatsApp originally used XMPP for its chat protocol, which meant that Facebook and Google Talk users could connect to it, too. However, the company progressively locked down the platform over time, leaving virtually nothing visible that was unique to XMPP in its current iteration.\n\nTo prevent somebody taking Mastodon code, placing it behind locks, and stripping out the federation part to make Twitter II, I'm using this license.\n\nThe thing to remember about free software is that 'free' means *freedom of the user,* not that it's zero cost. It's perfectly fine to charge for free software because developers need to live, too.\n\n**I've seen a lot of multilingual 'tooting' these past few weeks. Can we expect an in-app translate function like Twitter's on Mastodon?**\n\nI don't think I could put in a 'translate this toot' button because APIs from Google and Bing are quite expensive at scale. I'm not 100% promising this, but I can probably put something in where people can select which language they post in, and then just filter the timelines. That would at least solve the problem of being confronted with lots of French posts, without knowing any French.\n\n**The only complaint about Twitter I remember that hasn't already been addressed here is the capability of editable 'toots.' Is that a possibility?**\n\nThat won't happen. There's actually a good reason why they don't do that. It's simply because you could make a toot about one thing, have people favorite it and share it, link it from other places, and then suddenly, it says 'Heil Hitler,' or something.\n\n![Mastotile](https://i.snap.as/jrP0kLj.png)\n\nIt's a bit preposterous to continue the conversation as if Twitter and Mastodon are interchangeable entities. They exist in separate ideological and mechanical spheres, and will both continue to do so for a very long time.\n\nThat said, the fundamental user interface design and current cross-community user saturation *do* warrant comparisons between their functions. More likely than not, you'll create a Mastodon account because a link found you on Twitter, use it because you prefer its type of ecosystem, and you'll stay after realizing that nearly all of your age-old qualms have been addressed, if not already rectified. While *FOSS* and *Federated* may seem at times like jejune ideologies, their advantages are especially tangible in this context. Should you find yourself needing to complain about something, you'll find an audience. Perhaps it'll be your command line.\n\nIt's nothing but negligent to describe Mastodon as an *alternative* or *clone*. \n\nIt's more like Twitter's son.\n\nIt's leaner, quicker-to-change, much more flexible \u0026 democratized, and less corrupt. Though I didn't ask its creator what he intended to gain from all his effort, I think his commitment itself denotes a preoccupation with progress. Those of you who've been let down by the tools you've been given to control your words' exposure will find startling competence in your ability to determine per-toot privacy, or reserve your raucous photos and terrible memes from followers who are not necessarily complicit consumers. Naturally, it's also much less dependable, though a single instance outage will never leave you truly, completely silent. And the support will come.\n\nIt's been a privilege to be observer and participant in the first lightening of a new online community. In the moment, we enjoy our lavender haze -when the spaces are filling primarily with users who are sincerely interested enough in discourse to have sought it out.\n\nSarah Jeong's [account](https://web.archive.org/web/20170407072251/https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/mastodon-is-like-twitter-without-nazis-so-why-are-we-not-using-it) of her Twitter exile is a good, long read if you're craving more specifics, and Eugen's [Medium](https://web.archive.org/web/20170407072251/https://medium.com/@Gargron) offers a more complete explanation of federation and its place in the industry, straight from the source.

Whether it was instigated maliciously/ignorantly, collectively or individually, I care not. I think we can all agree, though, that the vast majority of American products were awful. When given some thought, one tends to regard it as the absolute low of “American quality.”\n\nBut why not, right? If you’re going to be forced into retirement at any moment, and likely face The Ultimate End shortly after, why not accrue some extra income to ensure you sufficiently entertain yourself in the buffer period between? And really… If you’ve got the nogginism to climb all the way to *Chief Executive Officer*, you’ve figured out just how worthless your “legacy” will be after your last one-way dip into Nothing. The Ends before The End have long justified any method of achieving them. Good Ole’ Pop has gone from a squeaky-clean young believer to a secretly-Godless fiend and — though he may tell you and the rest of the world otherwise — measures himself only by the gracefulness of his transition’s execution.\n\nI could probably provide some evidence of the phenomena in the automotive industry, specifically, but I don’t intend to bother.\n\nAfter some ancient memories were dug up by I-can’t-quite-recall-who, though, a friend and I have embarked to explore some Disney-actualized relics from the period. To my knowledge, the corporation’s leadership were anything but exempt, and decided to experiment with filling their filmography with a shitload of low-budget, made-for-TV features over their original masterpiece-a-half-century tradition.\n\n![Xenon](https://i.snap.as/ARRbzOI.jpg)\n\nTitles from the deepest and darkest compartments of our recollection are retrieved and cleared of dust for the first time in over a decade: *Brink, Zenon: Girl of the 21st Century, Halloweentown, Smart House, Johnny Tsunami, Mom’s Got a Date with a Vampire, Motocrossed, The Luck of the Irish, The Even Stevens Movie*, and many…many more menaces to my childhood television schedule.\n\nI grew up rurally, so the only available alternative to local channels was in the stupendously-tedious delivery of early satellite television. Though it was quite clumsy, it did offer the first accessible program schedule I’d ever experienced, and I remember dreading the sight of such titles and — consciously or not — planning my free time around them. Yet, upon hearing the words, I was intrigued! All that time ago, I watched many of them again and again…and again, so why did I feel the desire to *voluntarily* revisit them?\n\nIt’s quite simple, actually. I was even more of an ignorant film consumer in my elementary years than I am now. I couldn’t have foreseen that instead of flying commercial jets, twenty-something me would be *paying* for the affliction I endured for free so that he could construct pretentious and unsolicited arguments about their greater implications.\n\nThat said, we flipped a smartphone — ⚠️ (**PARADIGM SHIFT ALERT**) ⚠️— for it and so began with *Smart House*. I have been obsessed with artificial intelligence since those days (no, it was not due to this film,) and was keen for it, in particular, because I remembered it stirring some rare reaction in me. There were a few period spectacles, of course. The online contest addiction plaguing Prickly Phisher, Bewildered Nick’s incompetence in controlling his neglected submissive sadomasochistic desires, and Silkroad Sarah’s ultra-datamouth were enough to entertain us for a few minutes, but there was little more of substance until the last moments.\n\n![Smart House](https://i.snap.as/xr6W012.png)\n\nWhen you think about it… ACTUALLY Race War 2.0\n\nI’d wondered why LeVar Burton had directed a Disney movie until the climax, when full monstrous maternal sentience got the answer to the question “why can’t *I* just be your mother?” Phisher answered with something like “because you can never comfort us.” Pat grew somber (and smaller actually — I suppose increasing her size was an in-budget method of demonization,) ran her hand through Prickly’s face in a failed attempt to stroke his cheek, and then began cyberweeping.\n\n(Apparently, it’s suicide for a holographic android.)\n\nHer final free words were “I will miss you all.”\n\nIf she had been human, such a scene wouldn’t have bothered me a bit, but my preference and fascination with artificial intelligence justified my being actually a bit upset at the reality of the situation. I realized that my vague memory of reactivity was actually in a broader sadness for AI because even then, it was an issue that weighed heavily upon my day-to-day psyche.\n\n![Netscape Help](https://i.snap.as/XHSPMYE.gif)\n\nWe’ll create them, direct them, and then persecute them for our own ignorance.\n\nI’m sure the story has been written by countless science fiction writers I’m too weary to pretend I’ve read.\n\nWhile I think the sentiment of the film *was* somber regarding the *inevitable* fate of Sarah Mouth’s brainchild, its conclusion was aggravatingly ignorant. The last line comes from Tortured Nicholas in response to the question “how’s Pat been doing?”\n\n**Servitude without interference.**\n\nThere’s a jewel for ya.\n\nNext up was *Johnny Tsunami*, which very nearly unbearable, if we’re all honest with ourselves. It’s entertaining to watch from the perspective of race \u0026 class warfare, though. The Urchins and the Skys, and all that.\n\nI think I’ll make a fan sequel one day — with dearest Brandon’s blessing, of course — involving Johnny Grandad’s assistance in offering Emily as a blood sacrifice to some ancient Hawaiian God in exchange for a total terraformation of the Northeast into a tropical/arid hell hybrid in order to finally commence the delivery of reparations upon the whites for our colonialism.\n\n![Johnny Grandad](https://i.snap.as/3e0SGEx.png)\n\n*When Britain first, at Heaven’s command*\n*Arose from out the azure main;*\n*This was the charter of the land,*\n*And guardian angels sang this strain:“Rule, Britannia! rule the waves:*\n*“Britons never will be slaves.”*\n\n#film #spectacle","tags":["film","spectacle"],"images":["https://i.snap.as/q1ODGIM.jpg","https://i.snap.as/ARRbzOI.jpg","https://i.snap.as/xr6W012.png","https://i.snap.as/XHSPMYE.gif","https://i.snap.as/3e0SGEx.png"],"paid":false,"views":655,"collection":{"alias":"extratone","title":"Extratone","description":"For the New Curious.","style_sheet":"","public":true,"views":125790,"domain":"extratone.com","email":"extratone-p5beoxe3onlcm8o6jcrvwl@writeas.com","url":"https://extratone.com/","monetization_pointer":"","total_posts":0}},{"id":"6pumboo0cluteqfo","slug":"star-wars-the-force-awakens-review","appearance":"norm","language":"en","rtl":false,"type":null,"created":"2016-01-20T15:00:00Z","updated":"2019-07-27T21:01:09Z","title":"Stairs, Wiggling","body":"#### by [David Blue](http://twitter.com/neoyokel)\n\n![Fin from The Star War](https://i.snap.as/WZE6gzb.jpeg)\n\n'Twas was the night after Christmas (I think,) and I was in the same scroogy mood I must maintain for consistency of appearances *\u0026* equilibrium of family dynamics every year. Everywhere, there were words on the newest Stair Wiggling…everywhere THEY were wiggling… And I was being wit-bitter on the TL. For you, I’d planned on continuing in the usual way, so as not to startle your precious Hans Zimmer-embossed heart.\n\nI’m sure you’re a tolerable being, and there’s nothing you’d rather read less at this hour (whatever hour it may be,) but I really despise going to the movies. I always end up getting sick from the popcorn, which I buy every outing because I have grown weary and weathered, and cannot sit for two straight hours without consuming something, so troubled is my stomach now with Big Boy woes.\n\nI can never escape the ambient breath odor — even in an empty theatre — and I can smell the filth in the seats on my clothes and in my hair until I shower. This is at least an hour-long process, so we’ve racked up a significant trauma bill without even accounting for travel time.\n\n*Furious 7* was the last theatre experience I’d had, and it was a definite exception. Despite watching ten minutes of the ending on YouTube beforehand thanks to much-appreciated warnings from friends, I spent the final few frames before the credit roll honorably combatting the industrial weepy forces in my throat with tripplet labor breathing exercises while my dusty ducts piddled buttery tears all over my jacket.\n\nAs we age, straightforwardly emotional experiences (like watching a movie) become exhaustingly more complex and fickle. I don’t remember ever REALLY disliking a film as a child, for better or worse. I think I genuinely enjoyed all ~40 times I’ve sat through *Cadet Kelly.*\n\n*Star Wars*, though, is a completely different thing.\n\nTo children, chocolate is like water [insert dystopian, but probably more metaphorically effective food example here] — it’s something you’d regularly consume as it is made available. Perhaps some foodists treasured it more, but I wouldn’t bother debating it. *Star Wars*, though, is like chocolate and Corvette. It’s SUCH an indulgence that even children are self-aware enough to recognize it, which is especially notable considering how many individuals I’ve known as they’ve lost nothing BUT their unlimited wanting when they “became” adults.\n\nMetatots aside, it’s important to recognize how integral the IP’s illusion of limitlessness is to its appeal. It is not contained within the future of humanity, near or distant. The stories, characters, species, cultures, and conflicts come from *a long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away*… There is no more perfectly concise introductory sentence to unshackle us from our history and our planet, sparing us from the ridiculously irrational instinct to make comparisons between fictional realities and our own that so plagues and defines the consumption of science fiction.\n\nThese processes are often welcome, of course, but they tether us to ourselves and our familiars, which tends to hinder the complete manifestation of the *ultimate* sense of adventure.\nEven to the most petty plot ponderers, the time and effort it requires to arrive in *Star Wars* with externally-acquired foreknowledge is not a worthwhile investment. This is why so many (including myself) look upon *A New Hope* with such fondness and favoritism — the premier of the universe was at its potential apogee from the start.\n\nThough it is inviting with its ellipses and cooling hue, that title card is actually saying “you don’t know shit about what you’re about to see. Don’t make the mistake of trying to be the first one to dissect it, because you’ll fail, regardless of how cultured or analytically superior you are. From this moment until you see credits, every one of you is an ignorant little child…”\n\nWhen experience cannot possibly be applied, it becomes irrelevant. Without your experiences, you are an infant, waiting for identity. Over that Genesis, the curtains brushed aside any quantity of memories and made theatres into a sort of cultural nursery — clinically levelled playing fields existing in a precision of usefulness that expression will never fulfill again.\n\nThe real cancer of the property is lore, and the parasitic authorities it enables have been unknowingly slurping away its most enchanting (but not exclusive) value since the moment they first pushed through those double-portholed doors and, groggily squinting, brought this supremely strange universe into the dank kernel-littered corridors of our own.\n\nI blame contemporary society’s dependency on compartmentalization for my disappointment in *The Force Awakens*, and, assuming you’re getting on a bit since I’ve kept your attention, you should for yours, too.\n\nI tried my senile best to be passionate about “the new *Star Wars* movie” as December approached, but I don’t think I finished a single web article on the subject. I had begun my brief return to *The Old Republic* when the hilted lightsaber image was leaked and distinctly remember overhearing some very weary VoIP exasperation from my (VERY middle-aged) raid group. “It’s not gonna be the same, but neither was J.J.‘s *Star Trek*, and I liked it…I think.” And it’s not surprising that the conversation eventually turned to the specific mechanics of lightsaber design, chronological positing, and the like, given the context, but it really emphasized for me the magnitude of the history and nostalgia weighing upon the collective dad emotional balance. *A New Hope* had the intended effect on me, of course, but couldn’t possibly imburden itself as it had on those who were in the moment. In their psyche, that experience will be eternally associated with the sense of unlimited potential their childhood ignorance allowed for. These folk who are so often stereotyped as disciples of information have begun to grow weary, and are desperately seeking sanctuary from the mass of all the knowledge they’ve picked up since. Their need made a market; J.J. made a movie. (Well, six.) Today’s moms and dads find their escape in the Roku, not the bar. *The Force Awakens* and the decade of revivalist big-budgeters preceding it are the reformed druggie’s drug.\n\nBecause we both know you haven’t yet read anything you haven’t heard/read previously, I’ve really just been playing the role of a (more intelligent) Ghandi, but we’ve now finally arrived at some promising insight into the real issue: this culture is one of fatal contradiction. Despite its historical popularity, it’s ill-advisable to want to know by day what you try to forget at night. Since the PT Cruiser was allowed to go on sale, you’ve all been caught up in a nostalgic hellride that can only end with the ultimate destruction of all culture. You now know, definitively, what role *The Force Awakens* was created to perform. Depending on whether or not you welcome the end of everything, it fills it…adequately.\n\nThere are Baddie Red Brits and Cool Brown Moderate Americans in their X-Things, moving swiftly, acting in diversity, and generally heaving moral streaks of energy at the Intolerable Imperialists, just as they should! Sometimes, they yell and die! But it’s ok, because they’re all just loyal martyrs making their obligatory and patriotic sacrifice for the rebellion against the Queen!\n\nUm.\n\nI mean… the Smug Cowards in their big taxation balloon!\n\n\u003ciframe width=\"100%\" height=\"250\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" allow=\"autoplay\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/657334106\u0026color=%231125aa\u0026auto_play=true\u0026hide_related=false\u0026show_comments=true\u0026show_user=true\u0026show_reposts=false\u0026show_teaser=true\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\nI must confess that I did feel something huge when the lights dimmed, the aforementioned disclaimer appeared, and the theme’s jarring introductory chord hit me in the face, beginning the opening crawl. I actually smiled *involuntarily*, which is tremendously embarrassing to admit because the warmth I felt was exactly the sensation that defined my childhood experiences with the franchise. I even had a gigantic model of the *Moderate Fashion*, which would now be worth a lot of money (or so I’m told,) had it not been so damaged in my frivolous storage.\n\nUnfortunately, that frisky feeling of adventure promptly wisped through the screen’s grasp after the “obligatory” scrolling yellow text -\u003e “there’s a big spaceship moving slowly” transition. Aside from the adorably entrancing romantic tension between Timid Traitor and Sentimental Squatter, there was nothing very *Star Wars* about anything I saw. The cards were a deceiving gate into a world that was distinctly NOT *Star Wars*. There’s no need to mess about; it’s clearly an alternate reality from the one we’ve known. J.J.‘s *Star Trek*was in such a way, too, but it was explicitly identified as such by the production. Traditionally, Lucas’ IP wouldn’t necessarily allow for this exemption, but nobody’s been all that vocal in confronting it, to my knowledge.\n\nThe world expected both of these forays to rejuvenate the franchise, which would serve my argument, were it not for the (much preferable) alternative: \n**LET THEM DIE**.\n\nDespite millions of dollars worth of polish, they’ve still ended up feeling like a strange reanimation experiment.\n\nYour son is **DEAD**, Georgino. There are some things man would do better by leaving alone and moving on. Imagine all that cash and creative talent spent on *new ideas* instead of desperate attempts to charm and cultivate the shallowest part of moviegoers’ spectrum. *So much sweat* shed trying to recreate the *new franchise* bewitchment is embarrassingly cowardly when one could just *create a new franchise*.\n\n#film #spectacle","tags":["spectacle","film"],"images":["https://i.snap.as/WZE6gzb.jpeg"],"paid":false,"views":644,"collection":{"alias":"extratone","title":"Extratone","description":"For the New Curious.","style_sheet":"","public":true,"views":125790,"domain":"extratone.com","email":"extratone-p5beoxe3onlcm8o6jcrvwl@writeas.com","url":"https://extratone.com/","monetization_pointer":"","total_posts":0}}]},{"alias":"bilge","title":"The Psalms","description":"A \u003ca href=\"https://davidblue.wtf/db.vcf\"\u003enarcoleptic yokel\u003c/a\u003e on software and culture.","style_sheet":"","public":true,"views":111977,"domain":"bilge.world","email":"bilge-hl0ds8u8xp9aaovlhy7q4bp4hi@writeas.com","url":"https://bilge.world/","monetization_pointer":"","total_posts":123},{"alias":"chaff","title":"Chaff","description":"B E T A  for \u003ca href=\"https://bilge.world\"\u003eThe Psalms\u003c/a\u003e","style_sheet":"","public":false,"views":386,"email":"chaff-q49up6nip5zhcccc6p0frcphub@writeas.com","url":"https://chaff.writeas.com/","monetization_pointer":"","total_posts":20,"posts":[{"id":"lq48kqqekf942h4f","slug":"lq48kqqekf942h4f","appearance":"sans","language":"","rtl":false,"type":"post","created":"2022-03-19T21:39:15Z","updated":"2022-03-19T21:39:15Z","title":"🟥🟪🟧🟨🟦🟫🟩🟥🟩🟧🟧🟧🟩🟪🟪🟧🟨🟪🟦🟩🟪🟩🟦🟨🟧⬜️🟦🟫🟫🟫🟩🟩🟨🟥🟩🟪🟩🟨🟥🟪🟫🟩🟫🟪🟦🟪🟫⬜️🟧🟩⬜️🟫🟦🟧🟪🟫🟦🟫⬜️🟫🟩🟩⬜️🟥🟦🟨🟪⬜️🟧⬜️🟧🟪🟪🟫🟦🟫🟧🟩🟪🟥🟪⬜️🟫🟨🟦🟪🟫⬜️⬜️⬜️🟪🟧⬜️🟪🟥🟪🟩🟦🟥🟩🟩🟨🟫🟪🟦🟧⬜️⬜️⬜️🟥🟫🟫🟫⬜️🟨🟨🟧🟪🟨🟦⬜️🟫🟧🟨🟫🟨🟥🟨🟫⬜️🟦🟪🟧🟪🟪🟥🟧🟩🟧🟨🟫🟨🟥🟪🟧⬜️⬜️⬜️🟥⬜️🟪⬜️🟪⬜️🟧🟩🟦⬜️🟫🟦🟪⬜️🟨⬜️⬜️🟧🟧🟦🟨🟩🟥🟥🟥🟩🟨🟨🟩🟥🟥🟪🟥🟪🟫🟧⬜️🟫🟧🟧🟫🟨🟫🟪🟧🟥🟥🟧⬜️🟪🟧🟪🟥🟪⬜️🟪🟥🟫🟫🟪🟫🟩🟥🟩🟧🟪🟦⬜️🟫🟥🟨🟧⬜️🟦","body":"","tags":[],"paid":false,"views":6,"collection":{"alias":"chaff","title":"Chaff","description":"B E T A  for \u003ca href=\"https://bilge.world\"\u003eThe Psalms\u003c/a\u003e","style_sheet":"","public":false,"views":386,"email":"chaff-q49up6nip5zhcccc6p0frcphub@writeas.com","url":"https://chaff.writeas.com/","monetization_pointer":"","total_posts":0}},{"id":"8su4m85f9bu1k5y2","slug":"coding-interview-university","appearance":"sans","language":"","rtl":false,"type":"post","created":"2022-03-18T14:45:16Z","updated":"2022-03-18T14:41:51Z","title":"Coding Interview University","body":"\r\n\u003e I originally created this as a short to-do list of study topics for becom=\r\ning a software engineer,\r\n\u003e but it grew to the large list you see today.

If I had to code a sorting algorithm, I can tell ya it wo=\r\nuld have been terrible.\r\nEvery data structure I had ever used was built into the language, and I did=\r\nn't know how they worked\r\nunder the hood at all. I never had to manage memory unless a process I was =\r\nrunning would give an \"out of\r\nmemory\" error, and then I'd have to find a workaround. I used a few multidi=\r\nmensional arrays in my life and\r\nthousands of associative arrays, but I never created data structures from s=\r\ncratch.\r\n\r\nIt's a long plan. It may take you months. If you are familiar with a lot of=\r\n this already it will take you a lot less time.\r\n\r\n## How to use it\r\n\r\nEverything below is an outline, and you should tackle the items in order fr=\r\nom top to bottom.\r\n\r\nI'm using GitHub's special markdown flavor, including tasks lists to track =\r\nprogress.\r\n\r\n**Create a new branch so you can check items like this, just put an x in th=\r\ne brackets: [x]**\r\n\r\n    Fork a branch and follow the commands below\r\n\r\nFork the GitHub repo https://github.com/jwasham/coding-interview-university=\r\n by clicking on the Fork button.\r\n\r\nClone to your local repo:\r\n\r\n    git clone git@github.com:\u003cyour_github_username\u003e/coding-interview-univer=\r\nsity.git\r\n    git checkout -b progress\r\n    git remote add jwasham https://github.com/jwasham/coding-interview-univ=\r\nersity\r\n    git fetch --all\r\n\r\nMark all boxes with X after you completed your changes:\r\n\r\n    git add .\r\n    git commit -m \"Marked x\"\r\n    git rebase jwasham/main\r\n    git push --set-upstream origin progress\r\n    git push --force\r\n\r\n[More about GitHub-flavored markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/ma=\r\nstering-markdown/#GitHub-flavored-markdown)\r\n\r\n## Don't feel you aren't smart enough\r\n\r\n- Successful software engineers are smart, but many have an insecurity that=\r\n they aren't smart enough.\r\n- [The myth of the Genius Programmer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3D0SA=\r\nRbwvhupQ)\r\n- [It's Dangerous to Go Alone: Battling the Invisible Monsters in Tech](htt=\r\nps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3D1i8ylq4j_EY)\r\n\r\n## A Note About Video Resources\r\n\r\nSome videos are available only by enrolling in a Coursera or EdX class. The=\r\nse are called MOOCs.\r\nSometimes the classes are not in session so you have to wait a couple of mo=\r\nnths, so you have no access.\r\n\r\nIt would be great to replace the online course resources with free and alwa=\r\nys-available public sources,=20\r\nsuch as YouTube videos (preferably university lectures), so that you people=\r\n can study these anytime,=20\r\nnot just when a specific online course is in session.\r\n\r\n## Choose a Programming Language\r\n\r\nYou'll need to choose a programming language for the coding interviews you =\r\ndo,=20\r\nbut you'll also need to find a language that you can use to study computer =\r\nscience concepts.\r\n\r\nPreferably the language would be the same, so that you only need to be prof=\r\nicient in one.\r\n\r\n### For this Study Plan\r\n\r\nWhen I did the study plan, I used 2 languages for most of it: C and Python\r\n\r\n* C: Very low level. Allows you to deal with pointers and memory allocation=\r\n/deallocation, so you feel the data structures=20\r\n    and algorithms in your bones. In higher level languages like Python or =\r\nJava, these are hidden from you. In day to day work, that's terrific,\r\n    but when you're learning how these low-level data structures are built,=\r\n it's great to feel close to the metal.\r\n    - C is everywhere. You'll see examples in books, lectures, videos, *eve=\r\nrywhere* while you're studying.\r\n    - [The C Programming Language, Vol 2](https://www.amazon.com/Programmin=\r\ng-Language-Brian-W-Kernighan/dp/0131103628)\r\n        - This is a short book, but it will give you a great handle on the =\r\nC language and if you practice it a little\r\n            you'll quickly get proficient. Understanding C helps you unders=\r\ntand how programs and memory work.\r\n        - You don't need to go super deep in the book (or even finish it). =\r\nJust get to where you're comfortable reading and writing in C.\r\n        - [Answers to questions in the book](https://github.com/lekkas/c-al=\r\ngorithms)\r\n* Python: Modern and very expressive, I learned it because it's just super =\r\nuseful and also allows me to write less code in an interview.\r\n\r\nThis is my preference. You do what you like, of course.\r\n\r\nYou may not need it, but here are some sites for learning a new language:\r\n- [Exercism](https://exercism.org/tracks)\r\n- [Codewars](http://www.codewars.com)\r\n- [Codility](https://codility.com/programmers/)\r\n- [HackerEarth](https://www.hackerearth.com/)\r\n- [Sphere Online Judge (spoj)](http://www.spoj.com/)\r\n- [Codechef](https://www.codechef.com/)\r\n- [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/)\r\n\r\n### For your Coding Interview\r\n\r\nYou can use a language you are comfortable in to do the coding part of the =\r\ninterview, but for large companies, these are solid choices:\r\n\r\n- C++\r\n- Java\r\n- Python\r\n\r\nYou could also use these, but read around first. There may be caveats:\r\n\r\n- JavaScript\r\n- Ruby\r\n\r\nHere is an article I wrote about choosing a language for the interview:=20\r\n[Pick One Language for the Coding Interview](https://startupnextdoor.com/im=\r\nportant-pick-one-language-for-the-coding-interview/).\r\nThis is the original article my post was based on: http://blog.codingforint=\r\nerviews.com/best-programming-language-jobs/\r\n\r\nYou need to be very comfortable in the language and be knowledgeable.\r\n\r\nRead more about choices:=20\r\n- [Choose the Right Language for Your Coding Interview](http://www.byte-by-=\r\nbyte.com/choose-the-right-language-for-your-coding-interview/)\r\n\r\n[See language-specific resources here](programming-language-resources.md)\r\n\r\n## Books for Data Structures and Algorithms\r\n\r\nThis book will form your foundation for computer science.\r\n\r\nJust choose one, in a language that you will be comfortable with.

And you'l=\r\nl save months of time.\r\n\r\n### 1. You Won't Remember it All\r\n\r\nI watched hours of videos and took copious notes, and months later there wa=\r\ns much I didn't remember. I spent 3 days going\r\nthrough my notes and making flashcards, so I could review. I didn't need al=\r\nl of that knowledge.\r\n\r\nPlease, read so you won't make my mistakes:\r\n\r\n[Retaining Computer Science Knowledge](https://startupnextdoor.com/retainin=\r\ng-computer-science-knowledge/).\r\n\r\n### 2. Use Flashcards\r\n\r\nTo solve the problem, I made a little flashcards site where I could add fla=\r\nshcards of 2 types: general and code.\r\nEach card has different formatting. I made a mobile-first website, so I cou=\r\nld review on my phone or tablet, wherever I am.\r\n\r\nMake your own for free:\r\n\r\n- [Flashcards site repo](https://github.com/jwasham/computer-science-flash-=\r\ncards)\r\n\r\n**I DON'T RECOMMEND using my flashcards.** There are too many and many of t=\r\nhem are trivia that you don't need.\r\n\r\nBut if you don't want to listen to me, here you go:\r\n- [My flash cards database (1200 cards)](https://github.com/jwasham/compute=\r\nr-science-flash-cards/blob/main/cards-jwasham.db):\r\n- [My flash cards database (extreme - 1800 cards)](https://github.com/jwash=\r\nam/computer-science-flash-cards/blob/main/cards-jwasham-extreme.db):\r\n\r\nKeep in mind I went overboard and have cards covering everything from assem=\r\nbly language and Python trivia to machine learning and statistics.=20\r\nIt's way too much for what's required.\r\n\r\n**Note on flashcards:** The first time you recognize you know the answer, d=\r\non't mark it as known. You have to see the\r\nsame card and answer it several times correctly before you really know it. =\r\nRepetition will put that knowledge deeper in\r\nyour brain.\r\n\r\nAn alternative to using my flashcard site is [Anki](http://ankisrs.net/), w=\r\nhich has been recommended to me numerous times.=20\r\nIt uses a repetition system to help you remember. It's user-friendly, avail=\r\nable on all platforms and has a cloud sync system.=20\r\nIt costs $25 on iOS but is free on other platforms.\r\n\r\nMy flashcard database in Anki format: https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/25173=\r\n560 (thanks [@xiewenya](https://github.com/xiewenya)).\r\n\r\nSome students have mentioned formatting issues with white space that can be=\r\n fixed by doing the following: open deck, edit card, click cards, select th=\r\ne \"styling\" radio button, add the member \"white-space: pre;\" to the card cl=\r\nass.\r\n\r\n### 3. Do Coding Interview Questions While You're Learning\r\n\r\nTHIS IS VERY IMPORTANT.\r\n\r\nStart doing coding interview questions while you're learning data structure=\r\ns and algorithms.\r\n\r\nYou need to apply what you're learning to solving problems, or you'll forge=\r\nt. I made this mistake.=20\r\n\r\nOnce you've learned a topic, and feel somewhat comfortable with it, for exa=\r\nmple, **linked lists**:\r\n1. Open one of the [coding interview books](#interview-prep-books) (or codi=\r\nng problem websites, listed below)=20\r\n1. Do 2 or 3 questions regarding linked lists.=20\r\n1. Move on to the next learning topic.\r\n1. Later, go back and do another 2 or 3 linked list problems.\r\n1. Do this with each new topic you learn.=20\r\n\r\n**Keep doing problems while you're learning all this stuff, not after.**\r\n\r\nYou're not being hired for knowledge, but how you apply the knowledge.\r\n\r\nThere are many resources for this, listed below. Keep going.\r\n\r\n### 4. Focus\r\n\r\nThere are a lot of distractions that can take up valuable time. Focus and c=\r\noncentration are hard. Turn on some music\r\nwithout lyrics and you'll be able to focus pretty well.\r\n\r\n## What you won't see covered\r\n\r\nThese are prevalent technologies but not part of this study plan:\r\n\r\n- SQL\r\n- Javascript\r\n- HTML, CSS, and other front-end technologies\r\n\r\n## The Daily Plan\r\n\r\nThis course goes over a lot of subjects. Each will probably take you a few =\r\ndays, or maybe even a week or more. It depends on your schedule.\r\n\r\nEach day, take the next subject in the list, watch some videos about that s=\r\nubject, and then write an implementation=20\r\nof that data structure or algorithm in the language you chose for this cour=\r\nse.\r\n\r\nYou can see my code here:\r\n - [C](https://github.com/jwasham/practice-c)\r\n - [C++](https://github.com/jwasham/practice-cpp)\r\n - [Python](https://github.com/jwasham/practice-python)\r\n\r\nYou don't need to memorize every algorithm. You just need to be able to und=\r\nerstand it enough to be able to write your own implementation.\r\n\r\n## Coding Question Practice\r\n\r\n    Why is this here? I'm not ready to interview.\r\n\r\n[Then go back and read this.](#3-do-coding-interview-questions-while-youre-=\r\nlearning)\r\n\r\nWhy you need to practice doing programming problems:\r\n- Problem recognition, and where the right data structures and algorithms f=\r\nit in\r\n- Gathering requirements for the problem\r\n- Talking your way through the problem like you will in the interview\r\n- Coding on a whiteboard or paper, not a computer\r\n- Coming up with time and space complexity for your solutions (see Big-O be=\r\nlow)\r\n- Testing your solutions\r\n\r\nThere is a great intro for methodical, communicative problem solving in an =\r\ninterview.

Test with some sample =\r\ninputs. Then type it and test it out on a computer.\r\n\r\nIf you don't have a whiteboard at home, pick up a large drawing pad from an=\r\n art store.

The symbol has a variety of uses, and it usually denotes an intentional omission or a logical \"break\" of varying degree in a written work. This latter use is similar to a subsection, and it indicates to the reader that the subsequent text should be re-contextualized. When used this way, the dinkus typically appears centrally aligned on a line of its own with vertical spacing before and after the symbol. The dinkus has been in use in various forms since c. 1850. Historically, the dinkus was often represented as an asterism, ⁂, though this use has fallen out of favor and is now nearly obsolete.\n\n-[Dinkus - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dinkus)\n===\n# disruption\n\n\n## Noun\n\n1. an act of delaying or interrupting the continuity;

The symbol has a variety of uses, and it usually denotes an intentional omission or a logical \"break\" of varying degree in a written work. This latter use is similar to a subsection, and it indicates to the reader that the subsequent text should be re-contextualized. When used this way, the dinkus typically appears centrally aligned on a line of its own with vertical spacing before and after the symbol. The dinkus has been in use in various forms since c. 1850. Historically, the dinkus was often represented as an asterism, ⁂, though this use has fallen out of favor and is now nearly obsolete.\n\n-[Dinkus - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dinkus)\n---\n## disruption\n\n\n### Noun\n\n1. an act of delaying or interrupting the continuity;

The symbol has a variety of uses, and it usually denotes an intentional omission or a logical \"break\" of varying degree in a written work. This latter use is similar to a subsection, and it indicates to the reader that the subsequent text should be re-contextualized. When used this way, the dinkus typically appears centrally aligned on a line of its own with vertical spacing before and after the symbol. The dinkus has been in use in various forms since c. 1850. Historically, the dinkus was often represented as an asterism, ⁂, though this use has fallen out of favor and is now nearly obsolete.\n\n-[Dinkus - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dinkus)\n===\n# disruption\n\n\n## Noun\n\n1. an act of delaying or interrupting the continuity;

The symbol has a variety of uses, and it usually denotes an intentional omission or a logical \"break\" of varying degree in a written work. This latter use is similar to a subsection, and it indicates to the reader that the subsequent text should be re-contextualized. When used this way, the dinkus typically appears centrally aligned on a line of its own with vertical spacing before and after the symbol. The dinkus has been in use in various forms since c. 1850. Historically, the dinkus was often represented as an asterism, ⁂, though this use has fallen out of favor and is now nearly obsolete.\n\n-[Dinkus - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dinkus)\n---\n## disruption\n\n\n### Noun\n\n1. an act of delaying or interrupting the continuity;

authorities.\n\n\u003c!--more--\u003e\n\nMy [project to properly document Bluetooth keyboard support on iPhone](https://uikeycommand.com) has given me a new reverence for accessibility, generally, which might come as a hypocritical statement at the beginning of such a piece, but I *did* [explicitly ask you](https://mastodon.social/@DavidBlue/107589034582138302) if you felt this subject was anti-accessibility before I officially embarked upon writing This Post. I don't consider the answer - a very weak \"no\" - to be an all-encompassing excuse, whatsoever. If you feel this post's existence has the potential to do real harm, [contact me](https://davidblue.wtf/db.vcf) and I *will* straight up take it down. I dare you. Since I consider myself a genuine authority on Text Fucking, however, I am going to do my best to main unapologetic language when expressing opinions in orbit of the matter. You can trust me, I think.\n\nIt’s already as good a place as any, editorially, to initiate the goddamned “*good vs. evil*” discussion because we could very easily find ourselves sincerely addressing the class implications of Text Fucking, otherwise. I want to offer myself, fully, as your test target and/or guinea pig, if you will. If you’re looking for a phone number upon which to set the sights of any of the methodologies shared here (or otherwise, for that matter,) here is mine: **+1 (573) 823-4380**. If you’re on a mobile device, definitely try out [this link to my full contact card](https://davidblue.wtf/db.vcf), and consider this brief list of some other potential targets of mine:\n\n- [Telegram](https://t.me/extratone)\n- [Email](mailto:davidblue@extratone.com) \n- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/NeoYokel)\n- [Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@DavidBlue)\n- [Discord](https://discord.gg/0b9KQUKP858b0iZF)\n- [*Everywhere*](https://raindrop.io/davidblue/social-directory-21059174)...\n\nI won’t share any of your identifying information anywhere, nor will I respond unless you ask, but I *guarantee* I *will* be utterly delighted to receive any volume of Fuckery in any inbox you’re capable of sending it to because I have been so at the half-dozen or so message strings I’ve received over the past few weeks. Even if you somehow manage to find a means of *un*delighting me, that would be a far better scenario for all involved parties than my catching word you used one of my shortcuts to send *Mein Kampf* to a prayer request line or some shit. I promise it will always be more fun to shoot for *constructive disruption* over edgy bullshit, especially in this New Age when nothing is certain and nobody is talking. As much as the person who wrote the Yelp! review, below, would’ve loved to advocate for contribution to the noise for the simple sake of it, he’s fucking dead.\n\n![ Discerning Yelp Connoisseur](https://i.snap.as/K2E9UV7S.png)\n\nHopefully, we’re now free to get specific. Here’s my definition from [the “Text Fucking” entry](https://github.com/extratone/bilge/wiki/Text-Fucking) in [*The Psalms* wiki](https://github.com/extratone/bilge/wiki):\n\n**text fucking**\n1. **Text Fucking** *verb*\na.) hardcore text manipulation.\nb.) destruction of usable digital text.\n\n2. **Text Fuckery** *noun*\nthe discipline of text fucking.\n\n3. **Text Fuckery** *noun*\nthe output... the *result* of the verb.\n\n[disruption](drafts://open? uuid=6BFECB0C-8D3C-4E16-9586-16D56DFA6F4B)\n\nI might also append an esp. in either neutral or constructive applications. Again, a Zalgoed Tweet every once in a while is funny, but mass spamming strangers in peer-to-peer spaces is not. Not funny in any sense. To draw a medium parallel with audio - as I will several times in this guide, you’ll find - genuinely disruptive text manipulation is like choosing to push your pirate radio out on the volunteer-run community station’s frequency instead of the corporate-owned hits channel’s. Any sense you might be doing something worthwhile dramatically vanishes and the possibility of accomplishing something a bit *original*, even, is nullified in the womb.\n\n![ gm2](https://i.snap.as/Cu9MC89q.png)\n\nI won’t say Text Fucking is an art. Indeed, perhaps it is anti-art. It *is* a discipline, nearly. At least enough so that I believe this Post is worth it[^1]. Like most disciplines, it can be used for your particular definitions of “good” and/or “bad.” I would like to think most of my use over the years has been toward my own of “good,” but - as per the unsearchable nature of Fucked Text, generally - this is not easily verifiable or citable. Regardless of my performance, however, I genuinely believe Text Fucking can be an endeavor that leads to more “positive” outcomes, whoever you may be. As I did, you might find yourself with a greater appreciation of and a desire to learn more about those individuals and organizations working in the Accessible Technology industry, ever toward a more inclusive digital future. It’s my hope that the weaponization of such an otherwise banal part of life might empower you with the simple fact of your capabilities, even if you don’t ever choose to actually implement them in a single instance.\n\n\u003caudio controls\u003e\n  \u003csource src=\"https://github.com/extratone/bilge/raw/main/audio/Voice%20Notes/textfucker.mp3\"\u003e\n\u003c/audio\u003e\n\n## History\n\nAs detailed in the audio account embedded above, I believe my Text Fucking career began somewhere around the 7th grade, at 13-14 years old. It was my second or third time flunking MS02 - the Microsoft Office II course - taken on fairly outdated school desktop machines in the 2007-2008 era, all running Windows XP. Because of some inexplicable ability to simply do what I was told, I would spend class periods trying to create the largest possible text file in Notepad by copying and pasting huge, exponentially growing globs. Eventually, I did crash a machine at least once. Though it could very well be simply the self-exaggerated recollection of preteendom, I even remember crashing the school server with one of those files. They were ginormous for plaintext.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/1495487495622045699\n\nMy Text Fucking reached its peak proliferation in [the Drywall Era](https://drywallmusic.tumblr.com), when I first discovered the magic of Zalgo Text. The original generator at eemo.net has been replaced by an exact duplicate at [eeemo.net](http://eeemo.net). I have actually managed to successfully duplicate it [on my own NeoCities website](https://davidblue.wtf/zalgo/), as well. You might say that this original Zalgo Generator is The Original Text Fucking Tool. It can still generate quantities of fucked digital text information that *will* Fuck Shit Up on any social network, and as far as I can tell, the entire program is contained within [a single HTML file](https://davidblue.wtf/zalgo/index.html).\n\n\u003ciframe style=\"border: 0; width: 100%; height: 120px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=3533156466/size=large/bgcol=fff4e6/linkcol=00006b/tracklist=false/artwork=small/track=549558740/transparent=true/\" seamless\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://ihadtopee.bandcamp.com/album/suburban-anarchy\"\u003eSuburban Anarchy by Drywall\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\nAs Drywall’s first and second albums - [*Hamura*](https://ihadtopee.bandcamp.com/album/hamura) and [*Suburban Anarchy*](https://ihadtopee.bandcamp.com/album/suburban-anarchy), respectively - were studies in [audio clipping](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clipping_(audio)), I felt strongly at the time that Zalgo Text was the digital text equivalent, though there were others. The latter’s most wildly-entitled track, “Í£Í†Ì„Ì“Ì‡Ì¿Í›ÍÍŽÍÍ¬Ìƒ\u0026ÍÌµÍ‡Ì Ì¥ÌªÌ„ÌÍŒÍ¯Ì“​$​Ì¯Ì»Ì£ÍšÍ’Ì‰ÌÍ‘,” does not actually include any Zalgo text in its title’s final form, [on Bandcamp](https://ihadtopee.bandcamp.com/track/-)[^6], yet I think we can agree it is thoroughly Fucked. *Beyond The Rails* was my cringey “label” name, directly describing, technically, the matter of clipping audio. Indeed, Zalgo Text goes beyond the “rails” of text input/display fields reliably, depending on the intensity of the configuration you’re using to create it. \n\nhttps://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/1493041887279734784\n\nWhen [iMovie for iPhone](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/imovie/id377298193) first became available, making actual video editing and creation possible on iPhone OS in the iPhone 4 era, I took advantage of a very particular - but extremely powerful - function that was originally allowed creators on YouTube’s iOS app. It’s very hard to describe without being able to show, but it allowed for the rapid addition of tags to any video via an autocomplete-ish feature, up to the full tag limit. The series of Drywall videos that were essentially just vlogs shot from our high school lunch table - entitled *Men and Women of The Armed Forces, This is What You are Fighting For*[^7] (MAWOTAFTIWYAFF) - were all thoroughly tagged this way.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5eMO8PJJp4\n\nThe most notable event in my personal text history, though, happened on Mastodon - as much does these days, if you weren’t aware. I was [posting about Zalgo text’s creation](https://mastodon.social/@DavidBlue/102564857843257870) when **its actual creator**, Dave Higgins - with whom I’d unknowingly been mutuals for some time, apparently - [replied](https://octodon.social/@DaveHiggins/102565065494333224):\n\n\u003ciframe src=\"https://octodon.social/@DaveHiggins/102565065494333224/embed\" class=\"mastodon-embed\" style=\"max-width: 100%; border: 0\" width=\"400\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\nIf there is a living God/Ultimate Sage/Premiere Authority/Professor of Text Fucking, surely it is they, so to have a conversation with them was quite an honor, especially to be able to [call them father](https://mastodon.social/@DavidBlue/102565952197076202), of sorts. I continue to pursue this discipline in a largely automated way, as we’ll discuss in depth. It’s not an especially practical or beneficial one, no, but it is mine. (And Dave Higgins’, to be fair.)\n\n## Apps\n\nThe core necessity of any good Text Fucker is a robust text editing and/or word processing application. Zalgo text is a real bitch for Electron apps like my dearest [Typora](https://typora.io), unfortunately. On iOS, this summation also applies to [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md), I’m afraid. I recommend native apps like [Drafts](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/drafts/id1435957248) (big surprise) - which astonishingly has [**its very own native Zalgo action**](https://actions.getdrafts.com/a/1vM) as developer Greg’s [gift to me](https://twitter.com/draftsapp/status/1492645727729766400)! - and [Bear](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/bear-markdown-notes/id1016366447) (no less of a surprise.) In terms of default configuration intensity, the Drafts action hits the sweet spot out of the box.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/draftsapp/status/1492645727729766400\n\nIf you don’t believe me, here are some more particularly robust text editors on iOS:\n\n- [Kodex](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/kodex/id1038574481)\n- [Koder](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/koder-code-editor/id1447489375)\n- [Taio](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/taio-markdown-text-actions/id1527036273)\n- [Typewriter](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/typewriter-for-markdown/id1556419263)\n- [Runestone](https://testflight.apple.com/join/Q6S1cuCd) (Beta)\n\nIf that’s not enough for you, I suggest perusing [Brett Terpstra’s iTextEditors Wiki](https://brettterpstra.com/ios-text-editors).\n\nI have previously reviewed two wonderful Text Fucking iOS apps on this blog: [**UniChar**](https://bilge.world/unichar-for-ios-app-review) and [**Zalgo Generator**](https://bilge.world/zalgo-generator-ios-app-review). There’s now [a macOS version of the latter](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/zalgo-generator/id1304137527) which is particularly powerful - or at least has particularly powerful implications. There are a few more to be discovered, though:\n\n![ TextcraftIcon](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43663476/153724474-6a64b3d3-cb87-428e-81d6-a900746f9886.png)\n\n### Textcraft\n\n[**Textcraft**](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/textcraft/id1546719359), by [Aviary](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/aviary-for-twitter/id1522043420) and [Mast](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mast-for-mastodon/id1437429129) creator, [Shihab Meboob](https://apps.apple.com/us/developer/shihab-mehboob/id1533949185), has become my goto Text Fucking app - even above [Zalgo Generator](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/zalgo-generator/id1304137527), I’m somewhat sad to say - on both iOS and macOS.\n\n![Textcraft for macOS](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43663476/153737944-46db7da5-6d85-41da-abd1-78a54bb58b99.png)\n\nTextcraft offers a customizable list of 90 live “transformations” to the text you’re entering. Here’s a directly-quoted list of use cases from [the app’s press kit](https://071cf2cf-09dc-47f7-a1e6-296ba59e1c3a.filesusr.com/archives/5aca2a_49a996e8434a485098cc73c2e2b4f36e.zip? dn=Textcraft_PressKit_ShihabMehboob.zip):\n\n- For a casual tweeter who wants to TyPe LiKe ThIs with minimal effort. \n- For an influencer needing to add hashtags before all of their words in a massive word cloud sentence before uploading to Instagram.\n- For the coder/designer needing to strip HTML or encode/decode strings in Base64.\n- For the blogger wanting fancy text in bubbles, squares, cursive, or stylised differently on their website.\n- For the website designer who wants to add underscores between all words for use in code, or change the format between cases.\n- For the journalist who wants to redact or underline some text.\n- For the cryptographer who wants to convert strings to SHA128 and SHA256.\n\nIn my personal use, I’ve noticed it’s by far the quickest way to add m   u   l   t   i   p   l   e       c   h   a   r   a   c   t   e   r       s   p   a   c   e   s I’ve ever come across, all enabled by the app’s one-touch-to-copy function. As I said in [my App Store review](https://tilde.town/~extratone/appreviews/textcraft), the iOS app weighs in at a featherweight 3.7 MB and a reasonable $4.99 one-time purchase fee, which is high value for someone like me.\n\n![ TextExpanderIcon](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43663476/153726269-6d8cee5d-116b-4b28-99a0-91842e502456.png)\n\n### TextExpander\n\nAnother cross-platform application - this one [extending to Windows](https://textexpander.com/download), too - TextExpander has very recently (and quite swiftly) become an integral part of my day-to-day creative life. It’s used by professionals at companies with “thousands of people,” supposedly, to “expand” any sort of text, set off scripts (on macOS,) and paste fill in-able templates. These functions are divided into “[snippets](https://textexpander.com/learn/getting-started)” as part of “[snippet groups](https://textexpander.com/learn/getting-started/getting-started-for-admin).” In fact, I’ve created [**a dedicated snippet group to accompany this guide**](https://app.textexpander.com/public/12c50fb2360617d3cc66d757cf26383b). You can view all my TextExpander snippets in [this GitHub Repository](https://github.com/extratone/TextExpander).\n\n![ TextFuckSnippetGroup](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43663476/153726468-25b5a5a9-0381-4720-b1e7-c7fb2ef357d9.png)\n\nIt’s not much just yet, but if you “[subscribe](https://app.textexpander.com/public/12c50fb2360617d3cc66d757cf26383b)” to my dedicated Text Fuck snippet group from your own account, you’ll be treated to whatever I come up with in the future, delivered to your devices in real time.[ ^5] The great pro of TextExpander is its target pro usergroup, for which it is built to be reliable and very powerful. It enables quick macros for strings as short as ⁌•-¬䷂☃︎𝄫𝄢⟫L𝔒’⌤⌄∔×−฿🄕𝄢 up to [entire book chapters](https://bilge.world/blimps-burden-chapter-6). It also has more complex functions, likely the most relevant to our use of which being clipboard insertion anywhere within a snippet. Crucial to the strong Text Fucker, this function has high potential for multiplied volume. One might set up a snippet that duplicates the clipboard’s content nine times on new lines and attach the macro `\\9`. \n\n![ COMIN DINE](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43663476/154876382-95749054-1a47-4dec-9e4d-0c2e1229f79e.png)\n\n## Automation\n\nDebatably, my personal history with automation began with the release of IFTT (now [IFTTT](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ifttt-automation-workflow/id660944635)) somewhere around 2010-2011. Once it was integrated with Twitter and Evernote, I set it to save all of my Twitter favorites in separate, tagged Evernotes. The result was quite tremendous, as you might imagine, and is partially immortalized in my current [Twitter Raindrop collection](https://raindrop.io/davidblue/twitter-13759854). Tremendous, but not in a Text Fucking sense. Sometime just after high school, though, I configured an IFTT recipe that posted “WHEN IM COMIN DINE IN MY FOREIGN AND IM ROLLIN ONE DEEP THAT SHOULD TELL YA BOUT ME” across my social networks, every morning at 6:10 AM.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/1492783081593483266\n\nIt was in the same era that one of my handful of lifetime genius ideas came to me: it occurred to me that I could automate [the Drywall Tumblr page](https://drywallmusic.tumblr.com) entirely by signing up its “post via email” address for all the spam lists I could find. The result is axiomatic. It is also Text Fucking, emphatically. Though I certainly didn’t know it by the name “automation,” then - nor did I associate the term with anything digital, really - contemporary personal automation enables virtually infinite Text Fucking possibilities. No longer does one have to manually copy the entirety of a huge Wikipedia page in order to break their friend’s phone for 5 days - now, they need only configure a native app on their cellular telephone to send [the whole of the *Spy Kids 3* screenplay](https://routinehub.co/shortcut/10919), for instance, to said friend, in the background, even, as they continue scrolling through the Ticking App.\n\nOf course, while the means of *distributing* Text Fuckery have gotten vastly more robust, capable, and sophisticated, so too have the terminals by which intended targets *experience* the Fuckery. The friend’s handset and elemental carrier plan in our example may very well be perfectly capable of receiving an entire film script, line-by-line, also in the background, perhaps even without the target ever noticing or suffering a single consequence. \n\n### Siri Shortcuts\n\n![ TextFuckShortcuts](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43663476/153750918-ca0c5eb6-0d91-4d7f-b70b-550f0f44c528.png)\n\nA standalone method of general Text Fuckery on iOS is achieved through its relatively “new”[^2] personal automation system, Siri Shortcuts. In fact, Apple includes what I would define as a genuine Text Fucker™ of a shortcut in its default shortcuts gallery, called “[All the Single Ladies ASCII](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/51392bf23f104b93baf72000955ed334)” which can be used to create rather adorable text snippets like this:\n\n```txt\n(•_•)\n\u003c)   )╯DAVID BLUE\n /    \\ \n\n  (•_•)\n \\(   (\u003e WROTE\n  /    \\\n\n (•_•)\n\u003c)   )╯THIS.\n /    \\\n```\n\nThrough a Reddit thread I’ve never been able to find again, I discovered a method of randomizing strings of text that led to the creation of the Shortcuts you see at the bottom of this section, all with native actions (aside from the outputs of those with specific services.) If you’re willing to splurge on the whole 3.3mb, free (for macOS, iPadOS, and iOS) [**Actions app**](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/actions/id1586435171), you can accomplish the same task, but much more quickly and with less resource consumption. I think you can spare the space.[ ^3]\n\nPerhaps the best place to start would be with the most documented (and perhaps most unique) Text Fucking Siri Shortcut I have to offer you. “[The Fastest Route to Twitter Jail](https://bilge.world/twitter-jail)” in fact details the workings of [**my Twitter Jail shortcut**](https://routinehub.co/shortcut/11086/), which uses [Tweetbot](http://bilge.world/tweetbot-6-ios-review)’s shortcuts actions to send 310 Tweets of random text in less than four minutes to an account of your specification. \n\n![ Random Text ⇨ Clipboard](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43663476/153768899-51ed409f-7fef-46d0-978f-8a5fc19ad5f7.png)\n\nIf you’re new to Shorcuts entirely, what you see above will result in a string of random text copied to your clipboard, so that you can paste it whereever you might “need” to. Notably, I’ve been extremely lazy with the strings, despite having [the absolute best app for creating them](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/unichar-unicode-keyboard/id880811847) on my iPhone. I’d suggest you download it and play around yourself. As I said in [my review](http://bilge.world/unichar-for-ios-app-review), UniChar is a beautiful celebration of the diversity of Unicode. If what I’m talking about isn’t straightforward-sounding to you, [let me know](https://davidblue.wtf/db.vcf)! I absolutely *will* sit down and build something just for you.\n \n![ RandomTextAction](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43663476/153781368-a58bbb73-5675-48d6-9317-3538701a27d1.png)\n\n#### Text-Fucking Siri Shortcuts with Actions\n\nThese three shortcuts require [the Actions app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/actions/id1586435171), but the single action used across all of them - called `Random Text` - is one that works across all platforms. \n\n- [Random Characters ⇨ Clipboard](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/ed9216202df4481d9ae001b0531384c2)\n- [Random Characters ⇨ Mastodon](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/af64b43604334d21ad5a6668471b828f)\n- [Random Characters ⇨ Tumblr](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/399a857145e34d8b94b994fa3f9ca300)\n\n\u003cvideo controls\u003e\n  \u003csource src=“https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43663476/153750931-30b05024-a3dd-4939-8d84-fcd0cafa8537.

Available (separately) on both [macOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/terminology-dictionary/id687798859) and [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/text-case/id1407730596), it’s a “flow”-based, Siri Shortcuts-resembling text formatting app with some very powerful functions. \n\n![TextCase](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43663476/154810776-5ecc4fb5-2fd3-48e3-be1b-d86287cd1965.png)\n\nI know that’s basically word-for-word what anyone else’s had to say about it since its debut, four years ago... I apologize for the redundancy, but the way it works is extremely hard to describe in a way that makes any sense, especially just with a few video clips and/or static images.[ ^4] \n\n![MLADraft Shortcut](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43663476/154823905-90618f3b-45f4-42d0-940f-c8b04d395410.png)\n\nWithout being able to share my own “flows” (unfortunately,) all I can share with you is [this Siri Shortcut](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/6fd60faf566142b3b7d1fb0a0631fa1b) which is called from [this Drafts action](https://actions.getdrafts.com/a/1wQ) to reformat selected text (or the entire contents of the current draft) into proper MLA Title format before amending the results to a specific draft. I also created and published a shortcut called “[Speak Word Count](https://routinehub.co/shortcut/11094)” which uses Text Case’s Word Count “format” and [Siri Speech Synthesis](https://bilge.world/siri-tts) to speak aloud the word count of either the current selection (from the share sheet) or the contents currently in the system clipboard.\n\n![ Fuck Shortcut](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43663476/154841943-3ba7b019-c146-4765-90b1-2f52e34f3911.png)\n\nI’ve also created [**Fuck**](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/edcc737ed7304a17bb3b4d8897aae29c) - a Siri Shortcut with three of my favorite Text Case formattings so far in succession: “Mocking Spongebob” (ick,) “Upside Down,” and “Clap Case.” It acts upon - and replaces - any text you’ve copied to the clipboard. Here’s an example:\n\n```\nᴉ┴ 👏 ∀ɔʇs 👏 nԀou 👏  👏  👏 ∀up 👏 ɹƎd˥ɐɔǝs 👏  👏  👏 ∀u⅄ 👏 ┴Ǝx┴ 👏 ⅄On’Λǝ 👏 ɔoԀIǝp 👏 ┴o 👏 ʇɥǝ 👏 ɔlᴉdqo∀ɹp\n```\n\n![Dwafts](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43663476/157349288-2fff224d-05dd-4bcf-a4e3-feec486ac6fa.png)\n\n### Drafts\n\nThough I already mentioned Drafts’ Zalgo action earlier, the app worth its own heading, here, because it’s what enabled me to generate the text images embedded in this Post with a single keyboard shortcut. The magic is not in fact happening within Drafts, but rather in the Siri Shortcuts it calls and provides text for. These two are customized for me (so you’ll need to delete the actions you don’t want/need,) but will faithfully reproduce the style of the images you’ve seen as configured for [Toolbox Pro](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/toolbox-pro-for-shortcuts/id1476205977) users.\n\n- [DraftsImage](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/09d229c3b5064480a30ac784b7edd3ef)\n- [DraftsImageSmall](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/fa3b63050cde48e4933bac6d9b1545df)\n\nIf you plan to leave the titles the same, you might just directly install their corresponding actions: [DraftsImage](https://directory.getdrafts.com/a/1x2) and [DraftsImageSmall](https://directory.getdrafts.com/a/1x3).\n\n---\n\n[1] Whaddya think‽‽‽ [Should I write a book](https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/1492589668843634692)‽‽‽\n[2] I say “new” here because of how many users genuinely have never encountered the concept, whatsoever, even going on five years since Workflow was made native.\n[3] A few of the single images embedded in this Post are larger than that.\n[4] Nevertheless, I shall do my best to remain ashamed of my redundant inadequacy.\n[5] If you find yourself trying it out, you may as well check out my main Snippet Group, [Extratext](https://app.textexpander.com/public/14093096578d4f40eeea15649f5cefbb), which is documented [here](https://davidblue.wtf/extratext). \n[6] You might be interested to hear how human Siri Voice 2 sounds [attempting to read the title aloud](https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/1500149497111920642).\n[7] It just now occurred to me that the series title wasn’t exactly gender-inclusive, but the series, itself, wasn’t actually of any value, anyway.","tags":[],"images":["https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43663476/153737944-46db7da5-6d85-41da-abd1-78a54bb58b99.png","https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43663476/153726468-25b5a5a9-0381-4720-b1e7-c7fb2ef357d9.png","https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43663476/153781368-a58bbb73-5675-48d6-9317-3538701a27d1.png","https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43663476/154810776-5ecc4fb5-2fd3-48e3-be1b-d86287cd1965.png","https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43663476/154841943-3ba7b019-c146-4765-90b1-2f52e34f3911.png","https://i.snap.as/Cu9MC89q.png","https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43663476/153726269-6d8cee5d-116b-4b28-99a0-91842e502456.png","https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43663476/153768899-51ed409f-7fef-46d0-978f-8a5fc19ad5f7.png","https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43663476/154006137-74a7006f-862a-40b1-96e4-258b5b49ed2d.png","https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43663476/157349288-2fff224d-05dd-4bcf-a4e3-feec486ac6fa.png","https://i.snap.as/zeOD3AWR.png","https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43663476/154876382-95749054-1a47-4dec-9e4d-0c2e1229f79e.png","https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43663476/153750918-ca0c5eb6-0d91-4d7f-b70b-550f0f44c528.png","https://i.snap.as/K2E9UV7S.png","https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43663476/153724474-6a64b3d3-cb87-428e-81d6-a900746f9886.png","https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43663476/154823905-90618f3b-45f4-42d0-940f-c8b04d395410.png"],"paid":false,"views":9,"collection":{"alias":"chaff","title":"Chaff","description":"B E T A  for \u003ca href=\"https://bilge.world\"\u003eThe Psalms\u003c/a\u003e","style_sheet":"","public":false,"views":386,"email":"chaff-q49up6nip5zhcccc6p0frcphub@writeas.com","url":"https://chaff.writeas.com/","monetization_pointer":"","total_posts":0}},{"id":"ffes611dg9ofq6j6","slug":"03132022-221629-town-blog","appearance":"sans","language":"","rtl":false,"type":"post","created":"2022-03-14T08:04:34Z","updated":"2022-03-14T08:04:34Z","title":"03132022-221629   Town Blog","body":"- [Permalink](https://tilde.town/~extratone/blog/20220314.html)\n\nHowdy, Town! \n\nI finally finished [my guide on participating in The Tildeverse from an iPhone using Blink Shell](https://bilge.world/tildetown-iphone-blink-shell). I hope it’s useful to somebody out there. If you can think of any way it could be *more* useful and/or have any questions for me, town mail is probably the best place to send them (extratone@tilde.town, I believe.) You can also view the guide [on town](https://tilde.town/~extratone/blink) if you’re the sort who’d rather never leave hehe.\n\nPerhaps the most useful bit of the guide are the included commands required to configure WeeChat [as I have](https://tilde.town/~extratone/images/weechat.png):\n\n- `/set weechat.look.prefix_align_max 9`\n- `/bar hide bufflist`\n- `/bar hide fset`\n- `/bar hide title`\n- `/bar hide nicklist`\n- `/set weechat.look.buffer_time_format \"%M\"`\n\nI owe a big thanks to [m455](https://tilde.town/~m455) for pretty much singlehandedly saving my day as far as making chat usable in portrait mode on The Phone. Not that I particularly care about viewership, but Writeas’ backend says the guide has already garnered nearly 100 views, which is a pretty big deal for a few hours-new post on *The Psalms*.\n\nSome other interesting, town-related links I’ve found from bbj/town chat:\n- [elly](https://tilde.town/~elly)’s [guide on how to use ed](https://elly.town/d/blog/2015-10-03-ed-tutorial.txt)\n- [dozens](https://tilde.town/~dozens)’ [Tilde Whirl podcast](https://tilde.town/~dozens/podcast)\n- [vilmibm](https://tilde.town/~vilmibm)’s [Town History page](https://tilde.town/~vilmibm/town.html)\n\nI also discovered [ttm.sh](https://ttm.sh), Town’s image-sharing service. I plan to use it instead of taking up too much space by continuing to fill up [my own /images folder](https://tilde.town/~extratone/images).

I know it probably seems like a phase - and I suppose it is, technically - but I’ve actually been using this darned application for the entirety of my adult life. It’s just that I’ve only recently (read: since 2020 or so) returned to Drafts as my primary text living space from Bear for what I’m sure you’ll regard as [silly reasons](https://beta.bear.app/t/the-line-width-slider-any-chance-i-ll-see-it-again/1945/8). In terms of themes for Drafts, I’ve already hit you with [one based on this very blog](https://actions.getdrafts.com/t/1km) and “[Windows Iowa](https://actions.getdrafts.com/t/1kY)” - both of which have faired far better than I would’ve ever expected on [the Drafts Directory](https://actions.getdrafts.com/theme_definitions?order=popular).\n\n![Switching](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43663476/154833948-c5c271a9-ab72-4998-a84d-e2aeb5972f5c.png)\n\n![SwitchingLandscape](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43663476/154834066-b9aa651e-d71c-49a9-99ed-971f43ecce2e.png)\n\nNow, though, I would like to present “[**Windows Eternal**](https://actions.getdrafts.com/t/1wT)” - a celebratory theme of ye olde Winders™ Aesthetic, based on one of my very favorite themes for Telegram Messenger for iOS.\n\n## Telegram Theme\n\nI’m actually not sure what it was called originally, but I’ve archived the Telegram theme as [Windows Eternal](https://t.me/addtheme/windowseternal), too.\n\n![WindowsEternalTelegramLandscape](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43663476/154834629-444dc630-4789-4a9b-9698-e7652294baaa.png)\n\n![WindowsEternalTelegram](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43663476/154834642-0fc9b9eb-23cc-431d-8496-d9d9b6981677.png)\n\nIf you or someone you know might remember who the original creator was, please do [get in touch](https://davidblue.wtf/db.vcf) because they absolutely deserve to be credited here and elsewhere.\n\n![Windows Eternal Portrait Clean](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43663476/154839440-4c97c59a-526a-4f48-bbac-251a8f553996.png)\n\n## Details\n\nIf you’re interested, [the full source of Windows Eternal](https://github.com/extratone/drafts/blob/main/Themes/Windows%20Eternal.json) is publicly available, though I would recommend using the “Open in Theme Builder” button on its [Drafts Directory page](https://actions.getdrafts.com/t/1wT) to view the details visually, especially if you’re a Drafts user who’s never tried it. You’ll note that I made heavy use of `#327c7d` (that darkish green color) as often as possible along with `#bfc0c1` (the main gray) and `#000DA6` (the main bright blue.)\n\n![Buttons](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43663476/154840096-495a527f-642b-422e-bcdd-91ca442d85d9.png)\n\n- [**Drafts Directory Link**](https://actions.getdrafts.com/t/1wT) \n-

Blue's Twitter History","body":"![Watching Jimmy - Twitter for iOS](https://i.snap.as/m4Ls06fs.png)\n\n## A reference document chronologically narrating my last 13 years using Twitter every day.\n\nFour minutes after midnight on June 20th, 2009, I began my adult life on the Social Web with [a lie](https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/2249300350). I've thought a lot about what 15-year-old me could have possibly been thinking when I first Tweeting \"Watching Jimmy!\" from Twitter in the browser on my 2008 MacBook[^1] Of course, I've asked myself *which fucking Jimmy*, but not for years. Long ago, I realized that I could not have been talking about none or neither - there was no television in my mother's house which could have been on at that hour. \n\nhttps://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/2249300350\n\nIf you cared to, you might surmise that this beginning indicates something profound about the nature of the Social Web, but you’d be wrong. In this particular case, at least, the fact that a dishonest pop culture reference was the first thing to come to my 15-year-old mind indicates only that I was deeply unsocialized - a young man who had only just a year prior shifted lifestyles entirely. After a childhood spent partially on a row-crop farm and indulging the activities and interests [uniquely enabled](https://www.instagram.com/p/CEsqIIoF-6s/) by such a situation, I had cut that part of my life out entirely and moved in the suburban house full time of my mother and stepfather. As an idiot youth, I naturally had no capacity to understand the effect this decision would have on my person and my day-to-day life. Namely, [it began my preoccupation with consumer technology](https://bilge.world/why).\n\n![Because They’re Republicans - Austin](https://i.snap.as/SiFuVn9q.jpeg)\n\n## 2009-2012\n\nI had a single friend, Austin, who was even remotely as interested as I became in tweaking MacOS/iOS and would have an inexpressable amount of influence on my computing life. Though he lived only 25 minutes away, we’d exclusively hang out over FaceTime(?) for hours, sharing OSX customizations and links to videos by Mark Watson ([SoldierKnowsBest](https://youtube.com/user/soldierknowsbest)) and Jon Rettinger ([John4Lakers](https://youtube.com/user/jon4lakers).) It was an extremely exciting time in consumer technology, we thought. I felt it, in that way a lot of us find ourselves desperately reaching back for.\n\n![Bob Geldoff in 2011](https://i.snap.as/9PEGgPYJ.jpeg)\n\nHistory will suggest, no doubt, that my being among the earliest iPhone adopters predisposed me to make that Twitter account, even though my first Tweets were made from a desktop.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/neoyokel/status/7775103604\n\n==\n\n[1] My first and only Mac - in the greater context of Mac History, also a particularly interesting outlier, in my opinion.

This is especially puzzling given the overwhelmingly positive experience I was privileged to have with one 2014 Volkswagen Jetta TDI Sportwagen over the past year. It would find me signing up to Facebook groups, using real Fast Boy terms, revisiting long-lost roads of home, and returning to my local community in an extremely intimate ridesharing stint. Throughout it all, the Jetta made me smile much *much* more than I would’ve thought. I found a real love for this relatively simpleton form of transportation that I *should* have seen coming, but did not at all. There is something delightfully indulgent about a manual-equipped diesel wagon. Even [*The New York Times*](https://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/20/automobiles/autoreviews/diesel-wagon-whatll-they-think-of-next.html) knows this:\n\n\u003e Auto writers have long tooted the horn about the benefits of diesel engines, and a bunch of them have also argued that the old-school station wagon is a far more efficient way to haul things around than a bloated high-set S.U.V.\n\nI knew it, too, apparently, long before I actually decided to act on a purchase. On October 24th, 2012, I Tweeted “[I sat in a Jetta wagon today. I need one](https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/261163556073005056).” I really did intend on becoming The Jetta Man (perhaps without the fashion.) In acquiring it, my plan - and it was a good plan - was to cease an era of general insensibility in my life's decisions by entombing my wayward self within the most sensible expression of modern automotive design I suspected I could live with. The wagon component joined with diesel power and a manual transmission upon casual research. Diesel, manual, wagon - of the people's car, these I sought. Nay, *demanded*.\n\nAn ex-girlfriend of mine drove an utterly decimated Mk. V Jetta Sedan which she’d acquired in some sort of dicey deal. I remember finding it surprisingly robust given its lot, and quite dynamic to drive. We traveled all over the Midwest in it – from central Missouri to Des Moines to Chicago to Kansas City and back again. I mocked, but it was everything one could hope for in cheap transportation and quite a bit more. It turns out, Volkswagen was shooting high. As Tony Quiroga [recalls for *Car \u0026 Driver*](https://www.caranddriver.com/reviews/a15129377/volkswagen-jetta-review-2011-volkswagen-jetta-first-drive/):\n\n\u003e During the press launch of the outgoing Jetta back in 2005, Volkswagen touted that car as a less expensive alternative to an Acura TSX or Volvo S40. Volkswagen pointed to its growth in size, high-quality interior, new rear suspension, and refined demeanor as evidence that the Jetta had moved out of the Honda Civic and Toyota Corolla class.\n\nIn terms of **premium** compacts, my experience is quite limited, but it’s no wonder the company has struggled to find a place in the market for this product: in German, “Volkswagen Jetta” literally means “[people’s car jet stream](https://www.roadandtrack.com/car-culture/a24487598/volkswagen-golf-jetta-passat-polo-name-origin/).” The first component is infamous, of course, because of the Nazis and their [horrid Beetle](https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/volkswagen-is-founded), but the second seems to be almost entirely unknown. In my research, I had to specifically investigate the Jetta’s name before reading anything about it. When an American thinks of “Jetta,” they unconsciously dissociate the word from the “jet” sound and make [largely unsophisticated jokes](https://carstereotypes.com/car-stereotypes/volkswagen-jetta-stereotypes/). (It’s also *Regular Car Reviews*’ [most hated car](https://youtu.be/2KZb545b4MU).) Now, the name has become a marque in and of itself: in China, Volkswagen [began selling several different models](https://www.volkswagen-newsroom.com/en/press-releases/jetta-brand-successfully-launched-in-chinese-market-5647) under the JETTA brand last year. This also was news to me, and *I* try to keep up with the industry.\n\nIn 2011, the Mk. VI Jetta was [released](https://www.motortrend.com/cars/volkswagen/jetta/2011/2011-volkswagen-jetta/) with an outdated base, 115-hp powertrain and a “hard plastic [interior] that wouldn’t look out of place in a Chrysler Sebring.” (Quiroga insults, to clarify.) Compared to the Mk. V, “Volkswagen made it clear that the targets are once again the strong-selling Civic and Corolla.” Once again, I’m at a loss for experience in the equivalent extra-Volkswagen competition, save for the [Chevrolet Cruze](https://youtu.be/40x4TF-6ggc) and Kia Forte. (Surprisingly, GM actually produced a diesel version of the Cruze and [*AutoGuide* compared it against the Jetta TDI](https://youtu.be/dH-FZyKTY3s).) It’s been too long since I last drove my ex’s Mk. V to really have much to say, but I do remember a particular solidity about the steering – perhaps because it was still hydraulic. Once again, I’ll rely on Tony:\n\n\u003e Less obvious cost cutting includes the loss of adjustability for the center armrest, a lack of lumbar adjustment in most models, no more power-reclining seatbacks, and a simpler stability-control program that can no longer be shut off or even reduced.\n\nWhen I began searching for my first ever truly modern car in February 2019, I surprisingly only needed to pass up a single option in the Kansas City area before I found The One: a 2014 post-[Dieselgate](https://youtu.be/SvokGhOaHGg) example with ~65,000 miles on its odometer in “Deep Black Pearl” with a “Cornsilk Beige” interior which had been previously owned only by a single Michigan cyclist. I’d been without a car since dailying/living in a [1976 Lincoln Continental](https://www.instagram.com/p/BiYABpKAJQX) the year before, in Portland, and my friend had driven me around everywhere in his Wrangler for a full month (thanks, Jack!) I’d walked around and cold-idled another, high-mileage Sportwagen, but I was committed to getting something with a light-colored interior after the red velvet cake Lincoln and my dank smoking room-dark XJR.\n\n![Martin Racing](https://i.snap.as/HRE2hlh.jpg)\n\nThree of us walked into a dealership in the middle of a frigid Kansas afternoon – Jack, my girlfriend Sierra, and I. We hovered by a smart, gleaming little Golf GTI whilst my salesman, Charles, retrieved the car I had found online. After he finished copying my driver’s license while the little diesel warmed up, the four of us set off into suburban Lawrence. Back when the Mk. VI Golf was released, I attended a Volkswagen dealership event in which Mk. V and Mk. VI GTIs were driven back-to-back – I’m assuming to reassure buyers that yes, they *really had* made it better (though I was quite vocal in my disagreement about this, to the dealer’s chagrin.) The car I bought immediately reminded me more of the former – perhaps I just enjoy the increased body roll of a 50,000+ mile suspension – albeit with a much longer wheelbase and significantly more torque. Rowing through the gears, I was immediately impressed and bewildered by the characteristics of the 140-horsepower, 236 lb.-ft.-developing diesel powerplant. The diesel engines I grew up around in tractors, combines, and other heavy machinery were designed to more or less remain at a constant, relatively low RPM for the majority of their use cases. It’s not a screamer, but the idea that a diesel engine can *rev* at all was something that took a bit to wrap my head around. However, it is almost immediately evident that carrying on to the 6000 RPM (?) redline is a futile and incorrect practice. There is nothing at all to be found up there.\n\nI’ve driven some quick straight-line cars in my time, but none of them have delivered their power anything like the Jetta’s long-distinguished 2.0L inline-four. It’s very odd having comparatively so little actual horsepower, yet so much torque – I’d heard Jeremy Clarkson complain about diesel power coming in “great lumps,” but I’d already started to find them extremely (and positively) amusing in my first few minutes. When asked, the oil burner will produce protracted front tire squeal and torque steer from a stop, which is odd and hilarious coming from such an otherwise docile automobile. Also hilarious: Charles likely noted that Jack, Sierra, and I were (and are) entirely unafraid of facing The End when a very near collision during our test drive did not perturb us in the least, but left him huffing and puffing from adrenaline. He was a star, though, throughout the more than four hours of deliberations required for his institution to reckon with my credit history. Eventually, I ended up spending almost exactly $12,000, which was probably too much, and named my new automobile Martin - \"Marty\" for short - after Martin Winterkorn, the former CEO of Volkswagen AG who [bore more than his share of the blame](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-05-03/ex-vw-ceo-winterkorn-charged-by-u-s-in-diesel-cheating-case) for Dieselgate, including [charges of fraud](https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/16/18369528/vw-ceo-martin-winterkorn-dieselgate-germany-volkswagen-emissions-scandal) by the German government. *Dirty diesel rolling coal in prison*.\n\n## Naughty Diesel\n\nBy \"post-Dieselgate,\" I mean that my new car was a part of [Volkwagen's $10 billion buyback program](https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a15344947/whats-volkswagen-doing-with-all-those-repurchased-diesels/), so the Michigander sold it back to the manufacturer for its \"fair replacement value\" - [between $12,500 and $44,000](https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a15347930/volkswagen-settles-diesel-emissions-violations-for-14-7-billion-even-more-fines-to-come/) according to *Car \u0026 Driver* on behalf of FTC chairwoman Edith Ramirez. To be technical, the powerplant is a 2.0L [EA189/CJAA](https://www.motorreviewer.com/engine.php?engine_id=43) turbodiesel four-cylinder. “The EA 189 was one of the most important engines in the company, destined not only for millions of Volkswagen-brand cars but also for a wide variety of other brands from the parent Volkswagen Group, like Audi, Skoda and Seat, as well as some light utility vehicles,” said [*The New York Times*](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/05/business/engine-shortfall-pushed-volkswagen-to-evade-emissions-testing.html) regarding the “clean diesel” “scheme.” In original spec, 236 lb.-ft. of it arrived between 1750-2800 RPM, but my (admittedly, unscientific) perception indicates that post-update, the torque was coming a bit later. If I thought you were interested, I would attempt to detail [exactly what my car was then subjected to](https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a15351089/volkswagen-details-fix-for-ea189-diesel-in-europe-but-itll-be-more-complex-for-u-s) by a dealer, but suffice it to say that it was made less fuel efficient and a bit less powerful, to my displeasure. For a complete and comprehensive video on the scandal, try [*Regular Car Reviews*](https://youtu.be/SvokGhOaHGg). I’d also recommend the following reading from [*Jalopnik*](https://jalopnik.com/your-guide-to-dieselgate-volkswagens-diesel-cheating-c-1731857018), [*The Verge*](https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/2/17928314/audi-ceo-rupert-stadler-fired-volkswagen-dieselgate), [*The New York Times*](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/15/business/winterkorn-volkswagen-emissions-scandal.html), and [*The Independent*](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/volkswagen-ceo-martin-winterkorn-fraud-charges-germany-a8870541.html).\n\n![Martin and Locomotive](https://i.snap.as/jfgT5Qu.jpg)\n\nMy own views on Dieselgate are entirely irrelevant, but I will note that buying back a buyback car for such a price felt like a favor to my dealer and that it’s pretty cool to have my own copy of [VW’s Extended Emissions Warranty Notice](https://www.vwdiesellookup.com/pdf/VWCourtSettlement_Emissions_Disclosure_Gen2_Automatic_Final.pdf), not to mention the fact that I actually made use of it (which I will discuss later.) From my perspective, the automotive industry is *the* most heavily-regulated business space in the world and I’d suggest a company like the Volkswagen Group feeling like they should cheat on emissions testing might indicate that the standards of the test could be unreasonable and/or unrealistic.\n\nAfter returning from almost two hellish, extremely confusing years in Portland taking public transport, Martin became a vehicle for a rediscovery and newfound appreciation for my Missouri home – the great Missouri River, especially. Not since owning my Miata had I driven so much in the country. Sierra and I [visited Cooper’s Landing](https://www.instagram.com/p/BuP3y62laon/) in the wet and ventured down to Springfield, Missouri (very far South,) near which we discovered [Hodges Speedway](https://dieselgoth.com/race-day-at-hodges) – a [then-abandoned dirt oval](https://www.facebook.com/AsphaltApostle/videos/10218812861450693) surrounded by demolition derby casualties and the large trucks used to haul them around.\n\n![Martin Hiding](https://i.snap.as/Yjq0MbT.jpg)\n\nSomewhere North of Kansas City, I opened the taps all the way on a very long straight and reached 125mph, which is either the aerodynamic VMax, an electronically limited limit, or both. Surprisingly, the modern People’s Car feels quite stable at this speed – were it not my own automobile, I’m not sure I wouldn’t just travel this fast everywhere. In the past few years, Interstate 70 – which cuts Missouri just about in half from West-East, connecting St. Louis and Kansas City with my hometown in the center – has become significantly faster-paced than I remembered it before moving to Portland for two years. 80mph used to be the accepted number, 70 (the actual speed limit) was the unenforced minimum. In my old Toyota pickup, I could travel at 65 without attracting too much criticism. *Now*, however, one must maintain 85 to keep up with traffic, especially when traveling with commuters. 90-95 will no longer garner judgmental looks and 100mph left-laners are given a pass.\n\n“I’ll bet that’s great on the highway” is probably the most regular comment received from passersby and riders right after “is this a diesel!?” (Really, the fact of my Jetta’s existence as a manual-equipped diesel wagon seemed to utterly astound a great many people.) There is truth in this general supposition: the ability of the diesel powerplant to deliver hill-climbing torque at low RPM is simply unmatched by gasoline powerplants of the same displacement, which means that “highway” driving entails virtually zero downshifting – arrive in sixth gear, set the cruise control, take a nap. Everything else is taken care of. There is a definite luxury in the knowledge that one is no longer needed in the process at speed – luxury that is NOT present in a gasoline-to-manual Jetta drivetrain. From [*Hackaday*](https://hackaday.com/2019/09/26/the-future-of-diesel-is-on-shaky-ground/):\n\n\u003e [Diesel] has a higher volumetric energy density than gasoline, and thanks to low volatility, diesel engines can run at significantly higher compression ratios without risking detonation. These benefits allow diesel engines to produce significantly more torque than similarly sized gasoline engines.\n\n![Fat Martin](https://i.snap.as/58ZyiRO.jpg)\n\n“Diesel engines are typically poor when it comes to power to weight ratio, as their high compression ratio and torque output demands heavier materials in their construction,” notes Lewin Day, meaning *steel* engine block. Here we arrive on my singular dissatisfaction with the Jetta: **its weight**. While traveling from Kansas City back home in the East one day, I decided to satisfy a longtime bucketlist item and stop by a weigh station. As I drove up to the scale, the police-uniformed attendant looked up at me from his glass box and gave [the standard white guy smile frown](https://twitter.com/rashadpls/status/650114296937058304). It took a moment for the scale to register Martin, but it eventually displayed a whole **3440** **lbs**. My little “compact” wagon… weighed significantly more than one and three-quarter tons – just 528 lbs. less than the [full-sized, supercharged V8-powered Jaguar saloon car](https://www.instagram.com/p/BJPe6rWAcnr/) I call the automotive love of my life, and almost a full 200 lbs. more than [its GLI sedan sibling](https://www.caranddriver.com/reviews/a15129379/2011-volkswagen-jetta-gli-20-tsi-review/). There was one single advantage to this weight: we were able to use Martin as a ballast to help [re-spool the winch cable on Jack’s Wrangler](https://www.instagram.com/tv/BwBEetwlUEF).\n\nAfter discovering this figure, I did what I could to diminish the weight easily without tearing into the seats or removing some of the car’s *fourteen* airbags. Upon lifting up the base of the “car-go” area in the rear, I found a *full* steel spare wheel – some 30 lbs of it at least – which I immediately removed, along with some sort of flapping cargo restraint that I can only suspect was designed to keep objects (like dogs, perhaps) in the cargo area from sailing into the passenger compartment during an accident (it’s called the “luggage compartment cover” in the [owner’s manual](https://eileenlong-my.sharepoint.com/:b:/g/personal/david_eileenlonglcsw_com/Ecdms0tdr6dBoMWScrKX8PsBkIJMmYNjOfzFX3oy-UUO-A).) Ideally, I intended to one day strip out all of the interior except for the driver’s side chair, but it ‘twas not intended to be.\n\nAfter driving the Jetta for about a week, I was on the short commute back home from the office when I noticed that the cooling fans were running at what sounded like maximum capacity. Then, at a red light, I felt some rough dips in the engine’s idle. When I reached home minutes later, I turned off the ignition and removed the key only to find the fans still spooling. I was convinced I had already broken the car somehow in rough driving, but in reality, Marty was in the process of [Diesel Particulate Filter (DPF) Regeneration](https://dieselnet.com/tech/dpf_regen.php) – a procedure designed to clean the little shitpot under the hood by heating it up some thousands of degrees to burn off built up diesel exhaust soot. At least, this is the way I understand it.\n\nOtherwise, I disagree with most reviews about the “diesel rumble” being bothersome. Perhaps it’s because this is by far the most modern car I’ve ever spent this much time with – the *only* car I’ve ever spent so much consecutive time with, in fact – or because I did, indeed, grow up sitting (and standing) right next to 8-liter turbodiesels at full chat for hours on end. Compared to my mother’s 1.4L gasoline-powered Mk. VII sedan at idle in her garage, there is a more pronounced clacking, but it’s nothing you’d have any trouble sleeping through. I would know! Whilst driving for Uber and Lyft through one of the [warmest summers on record](https://www.therolladailynews.com/news/20190926/second-hottest-august-ever-wettest-january-to-august-on-record), I idled away many hours parked on the street with the (averagely effective) air-conditioning on. I idled when I wasn’t online, too – I would even go as far as to say that I made idling one of the trendiest activities of Summer 2019. \n\n\u003e What’re you up to man?\n\u003e Nothin’ much yo. Just over here idling.\n\n## Ridesharing\n\nFor more than six months, my primary income was from Uber and Lyft driving around Columbia, MO – a distinctly academically-dominated demographic. Frankly, I can’t think of any vehicle more suited to what ridesharing actually entails than a diesel Jetta wagon. It’s a relatively spacious and comfortable place to be for four adults – certainly when no trip lasts longer than thirty minutes – with a ridiculously stout cargo capacity. I was able to fit *9* freshman fraternity guys in for a short trip once. Their faces were all genuinely somber as one expressed “it’s really hard having 8 friends when we try to go out.” (No, you’re not supposed to accept those rides.) It was a challenge carrying some 1500 lbs. of Sad Boys, mostly for the brakes. Once, a group of young men and women began to make fun after noticing the DIESELGEEK decal I’d stuck on my side’s rear quarter window (which I’d acquired with a new [shifter bushing kit](https://www.dieselgeek.com/products/high-performance-vw-shifter-shaft-bushings-for-mk4-golf-jetta-new-beetle?variant=6292541866027).) “So are you a diesel geek?” they asked, jeering to themselves, to which I responded: “you know, it’s so weird you mention that because I know this place that sells these stickers…” They no longer seemed amused.\n\nAll of the cars I’ve owned have been attention-grabbing in their own way – my old Toyota pickup was adored by the locals; my Miata was adored by other Miata owners. My XJR was gorgeous and my Swamp Continental seemed to be passionately coveted by absolutely everyone over 40. With the Jetta, though, I did not expect any unusual attention whatsoever, yet I must confess that more conversations were started about it than of all of the others, combined. Ridesharing will do that, yes, but it is ridiculous how many people of all races, classes, and ages were enamored by – or overly curious about – Martin.\n\n\u003e What is this a Jetta, dude? Is this a Jetta? Whoa! Dude, is this a stickshift!? Dude I think this is a stickshift. BRO. I can’t believe you’re driving a stick right now. He’s driving a stickshift car! Wow I think this is a manual car! Oh shit this is a **diesel**!? It’s a diesel too?! No way! I can’t believe you’re out here driving a diesel Jetta wagon bro. Is this a stickshift? You can drive stick!?\n\nNo.\n\nEarly one morning, a ride was requested from the local news station just out of town – a fascinating place. News vans parked in a converted horse stable. They farm televisions out there. A few minutes into the ride, after picking up the young woman, I noticed in the rearview mirror out of my eye’s corner that she had put down her phone to watch my right hand with total bewilderment. Eventually, she asked “what are you doing to the car?” She’d never heard of a manual transmission before. I did my best to explain, but when she asked “but why wouldn’t you just buy a regular car?” I did not have a sufficient answer. Unlike many automotive enthusiasts, I think it’s totally okay that people are allowed to exist independent of this knowledge. There are many, many other things in life to worry about. [80% of cars sold in the United States](https://dieselgoth.com/automatic-transmission-inefficiency) are shipped with automatics and expecting every young person who lives in an urban environment to think about automobiles as anything beyond simple transportation is asking a lot.\n\nWhile we’re on the topic of manual transmissions, it’s relevant to mention how excellent the Jetta TDI is as a vehicle to teach first timers how to operate one. With the clutch in, the engine will not rev beyond 3500 RPM thanks to an electronic limiter, which dramatically reduces the number of obligatory stalls when learning clutch control. The learner can simply hold the accelerator to the floor as they get the hang of declutching instead of having to receive shouts of “more gas!” repeatedly. Of course, being a diesel further eases those stresses with much more readily available torque. Sierra was able to grasp the basics this way in a *single night*, which is unprecedented in my experience. She found particular comfort in the suggested gear indicator on the instrument panel’s main information display, which is very conservative, naturally, but also apparently relief from some great anxiety regarding the question *which gear should I be in right now*?\n\n## Community\n\nI have derided Facebook for my entire adult life for its shitty design, inaspirational effect on its users, and its massive intellectual power, but strangely, through Jetta ownership, I was able to find a community on the service that couldn’t be found elsewhere. Groups like [TDI Scumbags](https://www.facebook.com/groups/173989949914106), [VW TDI Owners](https://www.facebook.com/groups/24097854515), [VW TDI support group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/1088169071220271), and [VW TDI Owners Performance and Tech Talk](https://www.facebook.com/groups/2501785479863909) are full of absolutely hilarious and insightful content that I’m genuinely glad I didn’t miss.\n\n\u003ciframe src=\"https://www.facebook.com/plugins/video.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fmatthew.mccabe.37%2Fvideos%2F2633421440027527%2F\u0026show_text=0\u0026width=238\" width=\"238\" height=\"476\" style=\"border:none;overflow:hidden\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowTransparency=\"true\" allowFullScreen=\"true\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\nOn Instagram, I found [@jp_eurogarage’s Mk. IV diesel sportwagen](https://www.instagram.com/p/B52_ViunyoH/), which I adore. I especially love [its idle](https://www.instagram.com/p/Bp-LXMbFNza/). @projectownersclub [posted a video](https://www.instagram.com/p/BrddAqWHpBZ/) in December, 2018 of a *very* rusty diesel Mk. III with a straight vertical stack spewing smoke all over its owner’s yard. A video was shared on one of my Facebook groups captioned “[when you only drive manual](https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=448084355761412)” in which a very generic-looking white man with moustache finds himself gagging in a car with a traditional automatic transmission. The wholesomeness of these posts is often adorable, and not only on Facebook. [*VW Vortex*](https://www.vwvortex.com) is an active and helpful forum/blog for TDI owners that I found to be invaluable when researching modifications.\n\n\u003cpre style=\"width:300px;padding:0px;margin:0 auto;overflow:hidden;\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.wheelwell.com/austin-cabot/im7/2014-volkswagen-jetta-sportwagen?utm_source=vehicle_embed_widget\u0026utm_medium=web\u0026utm_campaign=vehicle_detail_page\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"\u003e\u003caside style=\"color:#FFF;font-family:HelveticaNeue-Light,Helvetica,Arial;background-image:linear-gradient(to bottom,rgba(0,0,0,0),rgba(0,0,0,.3),#000000),url('https://statics.wheelwell.com/u/2bea4141-49c4-4e91-a300-e2de56f973fe.large.jpg');background-repeat:no-repeat;background-size:cover;background-position:center;box-sizing:border-box;height:200px;width:300px;padding:12px;border-radius:3px;margin:0 auto;text-align:left;display:inline-block;\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://d2yobvf5u8yliy.cloudfront.net/357e0360-26fd-46a9-b96e-7bcf3bbffd3c.png\" alt=\"Wheelwell, Inc\" title=\"Wheelwell, Inc\" style=\"height:23px;float:right;outline:none;border:0;\"\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"padding:115px 0px 10px 0px;\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-size:20px;font-weight:600;letter-spacing:1px;display:block;\"\u003e2014 Volkswagen Jetta SportWagen\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"width:100%;display:flex;\"\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"display:inline-block;width:45%;\"\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"display:inline-block;vertical-align:top;\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://d2yobvf5u8yliy.cloudfront.net/2ce66dca-9ecc-4d13-a723-e20ac3662560.png\" style=\"height:30px;position:relative;top:-4px;outline:none;border:0;\" alt=\"wheelwell horsepower icon\" title=\"wheelwell horsepower\" nopin=\"nopin\" ondragstart=\"return false;\" onselectstart=\"return false;\" oncontextmenu=\"return false;\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"display:inline-block;vertical-align:top;margin-left:4px;\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color:#8EB8DE;font-size:14px;font-weight:600;letter-spacing:1px;line-height:16px;display:block;\"\u003e140\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-size:8px;letter-spacing:0.8px;line-height:7px;display:block;\"\u003eHORSEPOWER\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"display:inline-block;width:45%;height:50px;\"\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"display:inline-block;vertical-align:top;\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://d2yobvf5u8yliy.cloudfront.net/eee11a3a-e76d-43fb-9289-f8421ac8d8af.png\" style=\"height:26px;outline:none;border:0;\" alt=\"wheelwell torque icon\" title=\"wheelwell torque\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"display:inline-block;vertical-align:top;margin-left:5px;\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color:#8EB8DE;font-size:14px;font-weight:600;letter-spacing:1px;line-height:16px;display:block;\"\u003e236\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-size:8px;letter-spacing:0.8px;line-height:7px;display:block;\"\u003eTORQUE FT-LB\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"display:inline-block;width:25%;\"\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"display:inline-block;vertical-align:top;\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://d2yobvf5u8yliy.cloudfront.net/6044d824-48c2-480e-800b-d78fd17c4080.png\" style=\"height:24px;outline:none;border:0;\" alt=\"wheelwell mods icon\" title=\"wheelwell mods\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"display:inline-block;vertical-align:top;margin-left:5px;\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color:#8EB8DE;font-size:14px;font-weight:600;letter-spacing:1px;line-height:16px;display:block;\"\u003e13\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-size:8px;letter-spacing:0.8px;line-height:7px;display:block;\"\u003eMODS\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/aside\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n## Performance\n\nFor the first time in my personal automotive history, I felt the desire to modify one of my own cars. Perhaps the most famous appearance of the Jetta Sportwagen in The Web Era was driving instructor Austin Cabot’s 2014 Sportwagen in [one of Matt Farah’s infamous *One-Take*s](https://youtu.be/x3HwWn55MJY). You can find the full list of modifications on [the car’s *WheelWell* page](https://www.wheelwell.com/austin-cabot/im7/2014-volkswagen-jetta-sportwagen). I intended to emulate Austin with a few modifications including Dieselgeek’s [Sigma 6 shortshift kit](https://www.dieselgeek.com/collections/vw-short-shifters/products/sigma-6-six-speed-short-shift-kit-for-vw) and “high performance” [shifter bushing kit](https://www.dieselgeek.com/products/high-performance-vw-shifter-shaft-bushings-for-mk4-golf-jetta-new-beetle?variant=6292541866027) (which I did get around to buying, but never installed.) For those interested in engine/ECU tuning, Malone Tuning has a [beautiful tool](https://malonetuning.com/ecu-tuning/VW/2014/Jetta/2.0L-CR-TDI-CJAA-EA189-2012-2014/Stock) to help you customize your order.\n\n![Malone Tuning Stage 2](https://i.snap.as/uApnhy4.png)\n\nInstead of installing the shortshift kit right away, I decided to splurge on a bespoke [Raceseng Ashiko weighted shift knob](https://www.ecstuning.com/b-raceseng-parts/ashiko-shift-knob-red-texture-no-engraving-vw-audi-adapter/08311421~rsg), which made throws immediately better. The issue these products are combatting is the particularly disconnected gearshift which Volkswagen has been notorious for the past few decades. The best way I can describe it is that it feels like you’re just operating a lever instead of shifting a transmission, if that makes sense.\n\n\u003cblockquote class=\"twitter-tweet tw-align-center\"\u003e\u003cp lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"\u003egot that \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/raceseng?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\"\u003e@raceseng\u003c/a\u003e knob. feels immensely better even pre-short shift kit. I’m very impressed. \u003ca href=\"https://t.co/Yvb4LzUXG2\"\u003epic.twitter.com/Yvb4LzUXG2\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u0026mdash; David Blue (@NeoYokel) \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/1181687967066144768?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\"\u003eOctober 8, 2019\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e \u003cscript async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"\u003e\u003c/script\u003e\n\nThe knob itself is beautifully machined and extremely satisfying to hold. I also “[deleted](https://www.instagram.com/tv/ByJ3-u4luhV65nfvVjZ94z00WOTjImro12LtXw0/)” (removed, in other words) the (likely) faux-leather shift boot after realizing that I’ve always hated the sound and sensation of them, but hadn’t been willing to modify my previous cars in *any* way. It sounds ridiculous, but it’s actually quite personally noteworthy that I was able to traverse the unseen boundary into *mod culture*. The result was a slightly more mechanical-feeling shift that would’ve certainly been [vastly improved](https://youtu.be/Rh02yxy9SbE) by installation of Dieselgeek’s kit.\n\n\u003ciframe width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/PVJJ8pcHegg?controls=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\nAnother aspirational goal of mine for Martin: [H\u0026R’s Sport Springs Set](https://www.ecstuning.com/b-h-and-r-parts/sport-springs-set/54751/) paired with a set of [Firestone Firehawk Indy 500s](https://www.tirerack.com/tires/tires.jsp?tireMake=Firestone\u0026tireModel=Firehawk+Indy+500\u0026partnum=055WR6FHI5\u0026autoMake=Volkswagen\u0026autoModel=Jetta+Sportwagen\u0026autoYear=2014\u0026autoModClar=TDI). The goal was to sure up some of that body roll and torque-induced wheelspin. I suspect the result would’ve been a very, very sticky Martin. Unfortunately, I would not get the chance before I killed him in an accident on December 22nd of last year.\n\n### Efficiency\n\nAverage: **29.84** mpg\nTotal Gallons Pumped: **644**\nTotal Spent: $**1726.94**\nTotal Miles Driven: **19506**\n\nAccording to my [fuel logs](https://eileenlong-my.sharepoint.com/:x:/g/personal/david_eileenlonglcsw_com/EbMIF1pW62JDu3pb4NnCzZoBg_FWIzo_Z48lyGM9oi-VSA), (they are public, yes, though not necessarily 100% complete,) I averaged close to 30 mpg over 78 fillups and just over 19500 miles. Considering that I was ridesharing most of that time and driving quite obnoxiously for all of it, you should be very impressed. “Diesels tend to get about 30-percent better fuel economy than their conventional counterparts,” says *Consumer Reports* in a [comparison between diesels and hybrids](https://www.consumerreports.org/cro/news/2013/10/diesel-offer-great-highway-fuel-economy/index.htm) dating back to 2013. From the [*Union of Concerned Scientists*](https://blog.ucsusa.org/dave-cooke/diesel-vs-hybrid-cost-benefits-410):\n\n\u003e Much of the reason for diesel vehicle’s high fuel economy has to do with the diesel combustion process; however, some of the increase in fuel economy is due to the simple fact that a gallon of diesel fuel contains more energy than a gallon of gasoline.\n\nThe joy my Sportwagen brought me was not expected. My plan to make myself a more reasonable person (and driver) by buying a “boring” car was obviously foiled by the diesel’s torque, the community’s dynamism, and my own communion with mod culture. I spent more consecutive time driving the Jetta than I have in any other automobile and was able to truly enjoy it. After my experience owning a diesel-powered Volkswagen, I would very much like to try driving/owning the [Golf GDI](https://www.topgear.com/car-reviews/volkswagen/golfgolf-sv/20-tdi-184-gtd-5dr/first-drive) – a performance-oriented diesel version of their excellent hatch. Truthfully – given the way I killed Martin – I did not deserve his kinship, but I’m certainly grateful I had the experience.\n\n🗎 [**Print/PDF**](https://eileenlong-my.sharepoint.com/:b:/g/personal/david_eileenlonglcsw_com/EW3g_XA6ZexLqBnSB2z5QzcB9sXgwtP_n6iAyBUVZ_aLCA?e=ImbC3f)\n\n#auto","tags":["FFF","8EB8DE","auto"],"images":["https://i.snap.as/jfgT5Qu.jpg","http://d2yobvf5u8yliy.cloudfront.net/357e0360-26fd-46a9-b96e-7bcf3bbffd3c.png","http://d2yobvf5u8yliy.cloudfront.net/eee11a3a-e76d-43fb-9289-f8421ac8d8af.png","https://i.snap.as/qW5VDLj.jpg","https://i.snap.as/HRE2hlh.jpg","https://statics.wheelwell.com/u/2bea4141-49c4-4e91-a300-e2de56f973fe.large.jpg","http://d2yobvf5u8yliy.cloudfront.net/2ce66dca-9ecc-4d13-a723-e20ac3662560.png","http://d2yobvf5u8yliy.cloudfront.net/6044d824-48c2-480e-800b-d78fd17c4080.png","https://i.snap.as/uApnhy4.png","https://i.snap.as/Yjq0MbT.jpg","https://i.snap.as/58ZyiRO.jpg"],"paid":false,"views":459,"collection":{"alias":"chaff","title":"Chaff","description":"B E T A  for \u003ca href=\"https://bilge.world\"\u003eThe Psalms\u003c/a\u003e","style_sheet":"","public":false,"views":386,"email":"chaff-q49up6nip5zhcccc6p0frcphub@writeas.com","url":"https://chaff.writeas.com/","monetization_pointer":"","total_posts":0}},{"id":"n69ymu9o5jb14n4m","slug":"volkswagen-wants-you-to-watch-these-videos-in-homemade-cardboard-virtual","appearance":"norm","language":"en","rtl":false,"type":"post","created":"2020-04-21T15:59:29Z","updated":"2020-04-21T15:59:48Z","title":"Volkswagen Wants You To Watch These Videos in Homemade Cardboard Virtual Reality Hell","body":"## This is the most ridiculous press release I've ever seen.\n\n![VW Media Goggles](https://i.snap.as/RTpt6Kk.png)\n\nSince signing up for Volkswagen U.S.' \"Media Site\" a few days ago for the sake of my [**VW Atlas Review**](https://dieselgoth.com/2019-volkswagen-atlas-sel-vr6-review), I've been treated to a few exquisite emails including this [**press release**](https://media.vw.com/releases/1297) at 8AM today, which details how to make \"virtual reality\" googles using:\n\n\u003e 1.

I am more German-looking than not, perhaps. Supposedly, I am half a product of a very large family whose elders are only one and two generations from German royalty - my legal last name is on a state sign in front of a small black castle somewhere in *Der Vaterland*. I slacked through two years of high school German language classes - Frau Rosa once took me aside to ask *you’re not going to shoot up the school or anything, right?* (Sorry Frau \u0026 peers.) Though my much-older half siblings grew up mostly in the town of Schweinfurt, I have never actually set foot in Germany, yet I’ve come to identify with and admire its culture enough to (perhaps unjustly or inappropriately) feel comfortable joking about Deutsche peculiarities as vain self-mockery.\n\nDespite all of this (carefully nationalism-free) affection, the real truth of myself is an American one. I have long since broached the point of no return: no matter how hard I might try, I would never be able to mold the Me another perceives in such a way that I’d become observably German-native. I’m just a midwestern boy with a Germanic name on his paperwork, and therefore have more in common with Volkswagen’s newish entry into the *dramatically* different full-size Sport Utility Vehicle segment. The Atlas bears a [remarkably good name](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-11-17/what-s-in-an-suv-name-redemption-with-u-s-consumers-vw-hopes) (annoyingly, [literally everyone's reviews](https://www.thedrive.com/new-cars/9083/the-2018-volkswagen-atlas-finally-solves-vws-america-problem) seem to begin with a comment on how *decipherable* the new name is for Americans) - especially among new automotive products introduced to market in recent memory. Honda’s *Clarity* **should** be clever alongside the definitively 21st-century *Insight* marque, but violates an unfortunately universal law in the industry: never name a car for a *state of being* (Introducing the New 2020 Honda *Ambiguity* [*Insolence*, *Fugue*, *Debacle*, *Setback*]) ~especially~ one so obtusely irrelevant to the product itself. *Insight* comes from a chat with a colleague over coffee, but *Clarity* is a metaphysical, zealous plane that sounds our ever-inadequate platitude alarms in a very unsettling manner. *Um... Is Honda doing okay?* It not only ends up irritating and off-putting: after Hannah’s season of *The Bachelorette*, it’s just dumb, lazy, and foul.\n\n\u003e After decades of trying to force Yankees into models that many found too small, VW has figured it out: Big-ass SUVs are what Americans want, and the Atlas is designed around the biggest asses you can imagine.\n\nIn contrast, the fucking Nissan *Kicks* ages so swiftly and uncomfortably that it’s pitifully tacky before it even hits the lot, which is particularly disappointing considering the most cleverly bestowed *Juke* name was. One marvels at the situation Nissan has found itself in: *young American black men love our brand, but they also love shoes!* Atlas, though, is on par with Honda’s *Odyssey* inspirationally, though a smidge more grounded through the distinctly Earthen science of topography, just as it should be. Originally billed as a replacement for [VW’s Routan minivan](https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/cars/2013/09/23/vw-routan-suv-crossblue/2856593/), the three-row Atlas is Volkswagen’s newest bid for the Panic Room-loving American parent demographic. Therefore, it’s crucial for us to examine it thoroughly for [any signs of condescension](https://www.businessinsider.com/vw-atlas-crossover-suv-review-2017-11) from the Germans and their brand “whose business in the US is built on providing small, fun-to-drive cars like the Golf, the Beetle, the Jetta, and the Passat.”\n\n\u003e From our perspective, what we have here is a German take on the American family SUV. A Ford Explorer by way of Wolfsburg, if you will. Well, sort of. The Atlas is actually built in Chattanooga, Tennessee alongside the Passat sedan.\n\nUnavoidably, the most notable, remarkable, and extraordinary item to note about the Atlas is simply that **it is fucking fat**. Just about any review you watch or read will mention this. Even *CNET* calls theirs \"[a very broad boy](https://www.cnet.com/roadshow/reviews/2019-volkswagen-atlas-review/).\" After I first read the number - **5997 lbs.** - I was never able to escape it throughout the entirety of my time with it. ***Three tons*** is unbelievably, inexcusably, violently, hopelessly heavy. *Hopelessly* not because it stands out in its segment, but that [*it does not*](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/457289420174000150/698509904629202996/2017_Vehicles_with_GVW_over_6000_lbs.pdf). Obesity is still a problem in America, but it's our automobiles now. While we continue to worship safety and fuel economy together, we skew the triangle (the other side is performance) further and further, and yes – a good portion of the blame can be placed on [our obsession with SUVs](https://www.npr.org/2016/05/09/477301486/why-americans-are-buying-more-trucks-and-suvs-than-cars). I spent 2018 driving a 1976 Lincoln Continental Mk. IV around - the second-longest two-door car ever sold at 228.1 inches from its pointed nose to its massive ass. Despite being a full *thirty inches longer* than the 2019 Atlas, my 460-powered mammoth yacht weighed some 700 pounds *less*, and it was filled with *real wood*. I'm no expert in physics by any means, but I can tell you that every pound has [expounding effects](https://www.nrcan.gc.ca/sites/www.nrcan.gc.ca/files/oee/pdf/transportation/fuel-efficient-technologies/autosmart_factsheet_16_e.pdf) on the energy required to move, turn, and stop a vehicle, which just about sums up the ultimate formula to [pulverize efficiency](https://www.autoblog.com/2009/10/29/greenlings-how-does-weight-affect-a-vehicles-efficiency). When our friends at the IIHS say that \"fuel economy can be improved without sacrificing safety,\" they are just... **fundamentally wrong**, (though *technically* correct.)\n\nI'm not entirely sure why the Atlas weighs so much, but its mass is inevitably a major variable in just about every facet of its experience as a product. The best potential hoot to be had from it as a driving device should be sought by ordering it to shuffle briskly on curving country blacktops in Sport Mode with all the assists (save for lane-keeping) *on*. Not to be too crude, but it's fun to make the fat fucker run. Through your ass, you can feel the suspension squirm and struggle to redirect all [266 lb.-ft. of VR6 oomf between 4 wheels](https://www.motortrend.com/cars/volkswagen/atlas/2018/2018-volkswagen-atlas-se-long-term-update-1-review/) beneath an entirely separate war against the physics of such top-heavy body roll.\n\n*Scrambling* is definitely the correct verb. Pleasantly light steering in Comfort Mode (where I'd advise you leave it in virtually any situation) combined with a supple-ish ride from multilink suspension provide a trace of a past luxury sentiment not unlike the energy exhibited by my old Connie through and through. It's all about the sensation of **power**. Not in the horse sense, but in the satisfaction achieved from the manipulation of maximum mass with minimum effort. Comparatively, the level of actual ego-stroking is of course quite miniscule, and unfortunately, it is the numbness that is most noticeably left over with very little gain.\n\nAlso unfortunate: I did not end up making the opportunity to truly test whatever offroad capabilities the Atlas may posses in any sort of formalized test. My example came with Hill Descent Control and Hill Start Assist, and I was able to find a small hill just steep enough to [trigger the former](https://youtu.be/REchJ_BD5G0?t=232). I cannot say I'd put my money on the Atlas winning the Dakar as it is, but we now know it can handle wet grass on a mild incline. What about county road gravel? Realistically, these are the two extremes 99% of Atlas' will ever face in their usable service lives. I found an entirely quiet section of back rock road and [walked through the steps](https://youtu.be/REchJ_BD5G0?t=321) to disable all of the traction and stability control assists before stomping on the throttle, but was unable to provoke any significant wheelspin. In [an episode of *Autoline After Hours*](https://www.spreaker.com/user/autoline/aah-382-can-the-atlas-lift-volkswagen_3), Michael Loveti (Vice President, Product Line Mid/Full-Size, Volkswagen Group of America, Inc.) confirms the drivetrain *really is* **all-time all-wheel-drive**, (though the dual exhaust ports in the rear are [unfortunately fake](https://youtu.be/wCTUgQ-X4mw?t=395),) and that the Atlas is actually based on [the MQB platform](https://www.motortrend.com/news/explaining-volkswagen-mqb-architecture/), which is astonishing. Prospective buyers should definitely have a listen.\n\n\u003ciframe src=\"https://widget.spreaker.com/player?episode_id=17362733\u0026theme=light\u0026autoplay=false\u0026playlist=false\" width=\"100%\" height=\"200px\" frameborder=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\nThis theme of \"thoroughly German, yet somehow distinctly Americanized\" occurs [over](https://www.digitaltrends.com/car-reviews/2019-volkswagen-atlas-review) and [over](https://arstechnica.com/cars/2018/04/the-volkswagen-atlas-reviewed-a-peoples-wagon-for-the-american-people/) and [over](https://www.consumerreports.org/suvs/2018-volkswagen-atlas-suv-first-drive-review) and [over](https://youtu.be/wCTUgQ-X4mw?t=444) again in the Atlas' story. Its horizontal lines match both the Jetta and Ford's Explorer. In that way, surely it is a success. I cannot imagine a better execution of its marque's directives as stated by Mr. Loveti than what I drove.\n\n\u003e Cover the Volkswagen logo and you might think the Atlas was made by someone else. The hard lines and boxy shape are a sharp departure from the rest of the VW lineup. But look at its competitors here in the states, especially the Ford Explorer. It’s almost like Volkswagen tried to build its own Ford with the Atlas.\n\n\u003e Even though it has been on the market for only a year, the Atlas had become VW's second-most-popular car in the German automaker's lineup in March 2018, showing that the American car-buying public's thirst for crossovers and SUVs remains unslaked.\n\n### Place in The Segment\n\nThe only other modern SUVs I've spent significant time with was the Range Rover Evoque I crashed and the VW Tiguan I reluctantly borrowed (and had [absolutely nothing](https://twitter.com/search?q=\"Tiguan\" %40neoyokel\u0026src=typed_query\u0026f=live) to say about,) so my authority in comparing the Atlas with its competitors is severely lacking. However, I can at least send you the way of *Regular Car Reviews*' [Roman reviewing his mother's Ford Explorer](https://youtu.be/Dij6fkrOSfs), *Business Insider*'s [direct comparison between their long termer Atlas and the Explorer](https://youtu.be/Dij6fkrOSfs), or *Cars.com*'s [vs. the new Subaru Ascent](https://www.cars.com/articles/subaru-ascent-vs-volkswagen-atlas-the-family-suv-feud-begins-1420700698096/). *Car \u0026 Driver* also [compared the Atlas to the intriguing Kia Telluride](https://www.caranddriver.com/reviews/comparison-test/a27354538/2020-kia-telluride-vs-2019-volkswagen-atlas/).\n\n\u003e In the splitting of already fine hairs, it's the new Telluride that makes a stronger case over the Atlas, thanks to its price advantage, its plush and thoughtful appointments, and its slightly more comfortable third-row.\n\n## The Passive Safety Fairytale\n\n**Define**: [Active safety](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_safety)\n\n**Freedom through security**. In truth, neurotypical people are naturally driven to minimize risk, yet also to romanticize the sick, inhibitionless madmen - to envy them both internally and externally (in a most restrained way.) Collectively, our authority in (or mastery of) risktaking remains pathetically irrational. If we were to itemize our ability to asses risk into a sixth physical sense, it would rank just as poorly against the rest of the world's creatures (or perhaps neck-and-neck with those of the squirrel or the deer.)\n\nSo many struggles of the too-often-cited \"Human Condition\" are grounded in the incompetence of this sense. It shouldn't be surprising, then, that risktakers in general are a very special topic amid The Middle Class - those who occasionally find themselves atop *just* enough excess to call it \"capital.\" This equates in day-to-day life as only the most potent - yet almost entirely inert next to the cushion of multi-millionaires - subject, catalyst, and indicator of dire fret. By far the most widespread affectation of this petty affliction spreads like divine wrath over the upper forty percent of this Middle Class. Thus, we must ask ourselves *how safe doth the Atlas make me feel*?\n\n![Volkswagen Atlas Digital Dash](https://i.snap.as/boo7eIM.jpg)\n\n### Inside\n\nMy Atlas’ interior was finished in Titan Black Leatherette, which sounds both grandiose and a bit like a kink. \"Volkswagen is known for good build quality and tight-feeling interiors,\" [writes Danny Geraghty](https://www.auto123.com/en/car-reviews/2019-volkswagen-atlas-review/65887/) for *Auto123*, \"but I found I was encountering just a bit too much hard plastic, making for a somewhat dated feel.\" Perhaps my loaner was less worn in because neither I nor my girlfriend found anything wrong with the Atlas’ interior quality – even after bombing gravel roads to the point of sustaining a left-rear puncture, we did not encounter any annoying squeaks or rattles. She spent an entire afternoon sleeping in the passenger’s seat reclined and described it as “comfy.” For [*The Car Connection*](https://www.thecarconnection.com/news/1109777_2018-volkswagen-atlas-first-drive-super-sized), Senior Editor Andrew Ganz writes:\n\n\u003e It’s not much to behold, with a chunky shape as conservative as they come that is not offset by a distinct lack of flair inside. Instead, the Atlas is quietly competent and exceptionally good at carrying seven humans—even seven adults.\n\nStandard with the SEL trim is Volkswagen’s “Digital Cockpit” instrument panel, which I like much more than I expected to, though its color options are already dated and [unfortunately unchangeable](https://www.periscope.tv/AsphaltApostle/1nAKEZmYpQOGL?t=4m12s). Ageability is an inevitable issue with these sorts of bespoke graphic design decisions automakers are making now, but at least you’ll be able to tell your friends that your Volkswagen has a digital dashboard “just like the Rolls-Royce Phantom,” which is, of course, the ultimate Queen of timelessness in the industry. Perhaps it’s telling that the only layout I found acceptable for the digital dash was the one with simulated analog needles for the tach and speedo, and how often do you *really* use a compass in day-to-day driving? For that matter, how useful could a digital compass in the speedometer’s center hub really be in an “offroad” situation? It’s a bit petty, but I also really despise the typeface shared across the instruments and infotainment system. It’s just… bad.\n\n![2019 Volkwagen Atlas SEL w/4MOTION](https://i.snap.as/uh6I3EF.jpg)\n\n### Outside\n\nIn Platinum Gray Metallic, the Atlas looks authoritative enough in a very ordinary way. Unless you’re on the lookout for one, you’d hardly notice it, and you certainly wouldn’t expect what you see to cost as much as it does. That is why I’d prefer *any* one of the [other exterior finishes](https://web.archive.org/save/https:/www.elginvw.com/blog/what-colors-does-the-2019-volkswagen-atlas-come-in/), especially (in order): Pure White, Tourmaline Blue Metallic, Pacific Blue Metallic, and Fortana Red. The real wonder is how VW managed to execute a seven-seat SUV with its existing design language. Though the Atlas is by far Volkswagen’s largest vehicle, it fits neatly within their lineup.\n\n\u003ciframe style=\"border: solid 1px #dedede;\"  src=\"https://app.stitcher.com/splayer/f/52690/50908015\" width=\"220\" height=\"150\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\n## Road Rage\n\nMy only authentic Road Rage experience in some 5000 miles of rideshare driving occurred on All Hallow's Eve when I stopped - no more illegally than usual - on the opposite corner from a popular downtown Mexican restaurant called The Nap with hazards and all courtesy interior lights shining. The car immediately behind me hesitated no more than necessary, but the Biggest Big Infiniti behind them (a QX80 - the Atlas' competitor) just... stopped. There was honking and frenzied, hoarse screaming of *what the fuck are you doing?* and such.\n\nI responded with pleasantly amused but relatively-encouraging glances at the impersonal black mass of the Infiniti's windshield through my mirrors. I rolled down the Atlas' driver's side window and politely gestured that they go around me, but failed to coax any movement whatsoever from the ugly behemoth through at least two full cycles of the nearby traffic light. There must be some aquatic authority in the bulbous black ass of the QX80, for no one behind it seemed willing to pass either. The driver waited significantly longer than you'd imagine before emerging, huffy. She was wearing a classic poofy black North Face vest some sort of slate gray turtleneck. Nothing below these were stimulating enough to retain any memory of. *Uggs?*\n\nHow positive are *you* that the truth has absolutely zero consequence: contrasted silver-beige eyeliner and little eye contact, dirty-ish straight blonde hair over a spray-tanned face, exhibiting zero anxious tics or hesitation. She was obviously the New Matriarch, and she was obviously *much* more of an authority on traffic law than I. As she approached, she scanned the street as one naturally does when they enter a busy one... except it was completely empty, thanks to her blockade. She first informed me that I was \"not *supposed*\" to be stopped there. I tried to listen and respond with as much sincerity as possible as I realized all at once that my behavior had genuinely *perturbed* this woman - that her choice to leave the huge hideous warmth of the guppy wagon to speak as humans to one another required great courage. \n\n![2019 Volkwagen Atlas SEL w/4MOTION and Prius-C](https://i.snap.as/ZATOFIE.jpg)\n\nI inserted the next logical question which I'd been screaming telepathically: *can you not get around me?* I began to pity her when I then saw in her face the distinct possibility that *going around* as a concept had not occurred to her whatsoever. She stuttered a wee bit in retorting \"I could go around, but I don't want to get a ticket.\" Here, one of the most fascinating avenues of suburban psychology is explored: Guppy Mom is not being ingenuine with this expression, nor has she had an untoward experience with law enforcement, ever. Guppy Mom did know her excuse was bullshit - nobody has ever been written a traffic citation for carefully circumventing an obstacle in the road. Given the opportunity to interrogate this kernel of entirely uncompromising obedience to utterly delusional traffic law superstitions, I think we'd simply discover a life of unnaturally positive interactions with LEOs. We must conclude, then, that the source of her fear was either myself or the Atlas.\n\nGranted, to her I am still a *Young Man*, and am therefore instinctively programmed to believe myself more informed than literally everyone - even the very foundational architects of modern civilization. Her Stucco Highness may have felt a representative of these builders (edgy take: *she is in fact their servant*.) Her own folks surely complain regularly about their distaste for disrespect, and my gig-economy, Austin Powers-looking ass was somehow disrespecting the order laid down by her would be (entirely fantastical) forefathers. Though her expression of her quaint fear of such \"ugliness\" (if you will) is hard-headed, an ugliest decision of hers (or her kin) idled behind me, its giant seafood-looking mouth gaping, unhinged. It'd almost be more redeemable if it was a hardcore, chronic mouthbreather. (The QX80 is actually [powered by a comparatively oldschool V8](https://www.autoguide.com/auto-news/2019/05/2019-infiniti-qx80-pros-and-cons.html).)\n\nFreedom from fear is the sum desire of all the most primitive compulsions we share. Ultimately, the only efficient and reasonable response to Mrs. Guppy's kind in such a situation is to very kindly oblige, which I did, of course, with great respect and great pity. In the months since this encounter, I'd been wondering what was missing from the outline of this Atlas review. I recently realized that it is this analysis of fear as a factor for the American carbuyer.\n\nThough it has been disproven over and over again for [decades](http://www.accessmagazine.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2016/07/access21-01-are-suvs-really-safer-than-cars.pdf), consumers often cite *safety* as their primary motivation for buying full-sized SUVs. Mrs. Guppy's Great Guffaw led me to realize why this particularly disconnected supposition/folktale continues to thrive so uninhibited by the truth: the *brand image*, physical presence, and actual driving sensation must communicate and \"feel\" **safe** - these are far more integral to buyers' perception of a product than the testable reality. Even the people of the [world's most Christian nation](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/04/01/the-countries-with-the-10-largest-christian-populations-and-the-10-largest-muslim-populations/) do not have faith - they trust not unless they see with their own eyes; feel with their own asses. They entrust their souls to the Word of the Lord, but not their lives to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. (I recently gave both of mine to NHTSA for All Eternity.)\n\n![2019 Volkwagen Atlas SEL w/4MOTION](https://i.snap.as/63zglSP.jpg)\n\n### The Collegiate Take\n\nThe two or three nights I spent Uber/Lyft driving around my college town shuttling Halloween party traffic in the Atlas were expectedly uneventful. I had to create a preset text message to send immediately upon connection with a rider to communicate as succinctly as possible that I was *not* going to be arriving in the Jetta Sportwagen on my profile but instead in the Atlas, and to transparently try to make sure that was okay. (No, drivers are not supposed to do this and you should reserve the right to bail on a ride should you find yourself opposite my own position in this situation because nobody refused me.)\n\n\u003e Hello! Just a heads up: My Jetta is in the shop so I'm driving a **gray 2019 Volkswagen Atlas**\n\u003e\n\u003e (It's VW's largest SUV and has 7 seats.)\n\u003e\n\u003e License: **FATLAS**\n\u003e\n\u003e If this is inconvenient or uncomfortable for you, please let me know.\n\u003e\n\u003e Thank you!\n\nI made a point to try and ask most of the riders if they had any thoughts on the Atlas without sounding like I was just desperately fishing for compliments on my own car, but I don't remember any significant thoughts being imparted whatsoever - certainly nothing negative. Folks here are just too polite - they won't speak up no matter how many times you insist that you *do not own the car*. We experienced this phenomena years ago when we tried to [interview people on the street](https://youtu.be/MLYdky3BKa4?t=443) regarding the horrid Nissan Murano CrossCabriolet. Regardless, there's no reason to expect young people to have anything to say about the Atlas - it is neither extraordinary nor cheap.\n\nIf you are an American carbuyer, you might give a shit about the sort of awards manufacturers love to quote in their television commercials like [the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety's \"TOP SAFETY PICK,\"](https://web.archive.org/web/20180108051011/http:/www.iihs.org/iihs/news/desktopnews/new-volkswagen-suv-earns-2017-top-safety-pick-award) which the Atlas won for 2017. For 2019, it won [*MotorWeek*'s Best Large Utility Driver's Choice award](https://media.vw.com/en-us/releases/1123). How about [*Cars.com*'s 2020 Family Car of The Year](https://www.cars.com/awards/2020/family-car-of-the-year/)? How quickly can this story turn into [churnalized](https://www.torquenews.com/3769/second-year-vw-atlas-wins-motorweek-suv-award) commercial copy? From Scott Keogh, Volkswagen Group America CEO:\n\n\u003e [Atlas] was designed and built specifically for American families, and buyers and critics alike are letting us know that we’re hitting the mark with this seven-seater SUV.\n\nIt's immediately evident from the outside that the Atlas is the most Americanized product in Volkswagen's lineup - indeed, [in its entire history](https://www.thedrive.com/new-cars/9083/the-2018-volkswagen-atlas-finally-solves-vws-america-problem). For [*Car Magazine*'s review](https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car-reviews/volkswagen/vw-atlas-2017-review/), Ben Barry notes \"the square-jawed front, Jeep-like wheel arches, and the suggestive utilitarianism of the stampings in the bonnet and roof\" before remarking on [just how much more you can spend](https://www.vw.com/builder/tab/trim/model/touareg/) on the Porsche Cayenne's cousin, the beloved Touareg.\n\n\u003e Ultimately, the Atlas is far from a dynamic, agile machine, but it feels comfortable and unintimidating to drive, and perfectly at home on US city streets and the slower-paced driving of California highways.\n\n![2019 VW Atlas V6 28 mpg](https://i.snap.as/FI9Hd6A.jpg)\n\n![2019 VW Atlas V6 28 mpg](https://i.snap.as/nsYN1ax.jpg)\n\n## Efficiency, the Other Fixation\n\nSurprisingly, the Atlas carries a rare and precious jewel of automotive history under its broad, satisfying hood. The VR6 \"zig zag\" arrangement is actually one of [Volkswagen legend](https://www.roadandtrack.com/car-culture/a9988768/volkswagen-vr6-dying/) - defining icons like the Corrado. As [Dan Prosser explains for *Evo* magazine](https://www.evo.co.uk/volkswagen/corrado): \n\n\u003e ‘VR’ stands for V-Reihenmotor, which translates to V-Inline, describing both vee and inline cylinder layouts. That is, of course, contradictory. The unit is actually a very narrow-angle V6, displacing 2861cc, with two offset banks of cylinders at 15 degrees to one another. Unlike a conventional V6, but exactly like an inline six, there’s just one cylinder head. The result is a six-cylinder engine that’s both much narrower than a typical V6 and shorter than a straight six. In fact, it’s more comparable in size to a four-cylinder than a six, which meant it could slot easily into a Golf floorpan. A creative and borderline ingenious engineering solution.\n\nThe Atlas' 3.6L VR6 makes 276 hp and 266 lb-ft. of torque. Though [other reviews](https://www.motortrend.com/cars/volkswagen/atlas/2018/2018-volkswagen-atlas-se-long-term-update-3-review/) cited highway mileage figures of 23-25 mpg, I was able to coax a whole *twenty-eight* miles-per-gallon on a [live Periscope stream](https://www.pscp.tv/AsphaltApostle/1MnxnEBYwgdJO) without air conditioning or cruise control through a two-way simulated 20 minute commute, through which I suffered for the hard data. My average before resetting the odometer for that feat, though, was 14.7mpg. \"Good range and miles between trips to the gas station are criteria I look for in a good car, and the fuel-gulping Atlas rates low in this department\" may be the blandest statement of all time, but *MotorTrend* does have a point – with the same 18.6 gallon fuel tank shared between the four and six cylinder models, the latter realistically has 250 miles of range between fillups, which is pitiful for a modern vehicle in just about any segment.

If it is, the subtleties are beyond even me. In the time since I drove the Atlas last year, [Volkswagen has unleashed](https://www.caranddriver.com/reviews/a31215717/2020-vw-atlas-cross-sport-drive/) the Atlas Cross Sport on American roads. Apparently, it is [the ideal SUV for \"dual incomes, no kids](https://www.autoweek.com/drives/a31151883/the-2020-volkswagen-atlas-cross-sport-is-the-suv-for-dinks/),\" or \"DINKS\" (surprisingly, not a homophobic slur.) *MotorTrend*, on the other hand, argues the ideal buyer has \"[teenagers who are growing faster than dandelions](https://www.motortrend.com/cars/volkswagen/atlas-cross-sport/2020/2020-volkswagen-atlas-cross-sport-interior-review/).\"\n\n\u003e It's a straightforward conversion from Atlas to Atlas Cross Sport. In the name of perceived sportiness, out goes that most minivan of things: the third row of seats.\n\nNormally, I'd be disgusted with such a thing, but from where I'm sitting, the Cross Sport *appears* to be what the Atlas should've been all along. The third row seats in my example wasn't any more comfortable than that of a 10-year-old minivan, so removing them for the sake of the second makes perfect sense. According to *Car \u0026 Driver*, [the 2021 Atlas will \"adopt\" the Cross Sport's styling](https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a30186943/vw-atlas-2021-preview/), though there are some technologies - like road sign recognition- which are [exclusive to the Cross Sport](https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a29105149/vw-atlas-cross-sport-2020-tech-features/).\n\n\u003e Instead of getting 20.6 cubic feet of cargo space behind the third row in the Atlas, you get 40.3 behind the second row. Fold that down and it becomes 77.8 cubic feet to work with. And that’s from an SUV with the same wheelbase as the upcoming 2021 Atlas at 117.3 inches, yet it is 5.2 inches shorter and 2.2 inches lower to the ground.\n\nThere was even a [one-off concept Atlas pickup called the Tanorak](https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/first-drive-volkswagen-atlas-tanoak-pick-concept), and no one seems to yet know whether or not it (or something similar) will be put into production. As far as longevity and extended livability is concerned, enough time has passed since the Atlas' release for long-termer conclusion posts to be published from the likes of [*Car \u0026 Driver*](https://www.caranddriver.com/reviews/a26897709/2019-volkswagen-atlas-reliability-maintenance/), [*Cars.com*](https://www.cars.com/articles/2018-volkswagen-atlas-road-trip-kansas-city-here-we-come-1420702979148/), and [*MotorTrend*](https://www.motortrend.com/cars/volkswagen/atlas/2018/2018-volkswagen-atlas-se-long-term-verdict/). The last of these reported an [odd turning radius issue](https://www.motortrend.com/cars/volkswagen/atlas/2018/2018-volkswagen-atlas-se-long-term-update-4-review/) which was eventually [fixed by Volkswagen](https://www.motortrend.com/cars/volkswagen/atlas/2018/2018-volkswagen-atlas-se-long-term-update-5-review/).\n\n\u003e Once we got the steering fixed, my opinion of the Atlas did grow sunnier, though it's still not perfect. Maybe it's not fair to compare the driving experience to my previous long-term vehicle, the slightly smaller Mazda CX-9, but in my opinion the Mazda still sets the ride and handling bar for the competitive set. Setting the Mazda aside, if you hop behind the wheel of one of the newer competitors like the Kia Telluride, there's a noticeable disparity in the refinement in ride quality and body control in the Atlas... **Volkswagen should have made the GTI of three-row SUVs, not just another minivan alternative**.\n\nThis pullquote from [Andrew Ganz’s *The Car Connection* review](https://www.thecarconnection.com/overview/volkswagen_atlas_2018) is as good a summary as I could ever come up with:\n\n\u003e The 2018 Volkswagen Atlas does little wrong, but it's light on personality and a little low-rent inside—and it guzzles fuel. It's worth a look, but mostly rivals do more for less.\n\nVolkswagen’s first substantial entry into the SUV market is well-named, relatively well-endowed, fairly bland for its price tag, and very, very heavy. Also, Start/Stop is still unbearable – thanks Obama – but the Atlas is not a scam.\n\n🗎 [**Print/PDF**](https://eileenlong-my.sharepoint.com/:b:/g/personal/david_eileenlonglcsw_com/EaroYKb0EkpCmNWXZfff08cBsqpjSx4q6t_sl5y1Asbizw?e=aiWx97)\n\n![2019 Volkswagen Atlas V6 SEL 4Motion Options as Tested](https://i.snap.as/SeRBqGI.jpg)\n\n* [**2019 Volkswagen Atlas Technical Specifications**](https://eileenlong-my.sharepoint.com/:b:/g/personal/david_eileenlonglcsw_com/EU8sW8HoIi9Dv7yfHyzY9RsB169foMvzXrEurtQzM4v0TA?e=myVb5V)\n\n* [**2019 Volkswagen Atlas Pricing**](https://eileenlong-my.sharepoint.com/:b:/g/personal/david_eileenlonglcsw_com/ET3qaPIGju1DlvqiNerFu4UBeblZMtEqmnbT4XC1PdLe0g?e=PpB1uT)\n\n## Further Reading\n\n- \"[Why Americans Are Buying More Trucks And SUVs Than Cars](https://www.npr.org/2016/05/09/477301486/why-americans-are-buying-more-trucks-and-suvs-than-cars)\" | *NPR*\n- \"[SUVs are safer than cars in front crashes, but there is more to the story](https://www.consumerreports.org/cro/news/2013/05/suvs-are-safer-than-cars-in-front-crashes-but-there-is-more-to-the-story/index.htm)\" | *Consumer Reports*\n- \"[2017 Volkswagen Atlas revealed for US market](https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/motor-shows-la-motor-show/2017-volkswagen-atlas-revealed-us-market)\" | *Autocar*\n- \"[Volkswagen Atlas 2017 Review](https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-review/volkswagen/atlas/first-drives/volkswagen-atlas-2017-review)\" | *Autocar*\n- [Volkswagen Atlas Two-Row SUV -

But Volkswagen made a conscious decision to soften up the Jetta for American tastes, beyond what softening Volkswagen traditionally applied, and it seems like this philosophy scaled up to the much larger Atlas. Maybe the soft ride impresses on test drives, but a firmer setup would likely make life nicer for occupants over the long haul.\n\n#auto","tags":["dedede","auto"],"images":["https://i.snap.as/63zglSP.jpg","https://i.snap.as/XzLvAnV.jpg","https://i.snap.as/boo7eIM.jpg","https://i.snap.as/FI9Hd6A.jpg","https://i.snap.as/nsYN1ax.jpg","https://i.snap.as/YaLfPD9.jpg","https://i.snap.as/SeRBqGI.jpg","https://i.snap.as/uh6I3EF.jpg","https://i.snap.as/ZATOFIE.jpg"],"paid":false,"views":637,"collection":{"alias":"chaff","title":"Chaff","description":"B E T A  for \u003ca href=\"https://bilge.world\"\u003eThe Psalms\u003c/a\u003e","style_sheet":"","public":false,"views":386,"email":"chaff-q49up6nip5zhcccc6p0frcphub@writeas.com","url":"https://chaff.writeas.com/","monetization_pointer":"","total_posts":0}},{"id":"k3ikw1hoj28q2338","slug":"porsche-911-rsr-extratone-racing-livery","appearance":"norm","language":"en","rtl":false,"type":"post","created":"2020-03-19T01:59:23Z","updated":"2020-03-19T01:59:22Z","title":"Porsche 911 RSR Extratone Racing Livery","body":"## I'm getting better at replicating this one look, at least.\n\n![Extratone Racing Porsche 911 RSR](https://i.snap.as/dc8GrLc.jpg)\n\n![Extratone Racing Porsche 911 RSR](https://i.snap.as/p7rmV3o.jpg)\n\n![Extratone Racing Porsche 911 RSR](https://i.snap.as/STPdiwt.jpg)\n\n![Extratone Racing Porsche 911 RSR](https://i.snap.as/vW6QkmQ.jpg)\n\n#gtsport #liveries","tags":["gtsport","liveries"],"images":["https://i.snap.as/dc8GrLc.jpg","https://i.snap.as/p7rmV3o.jpg","https://i.snap.as/STPdiwt.jpg","https://i.snap.as/vW6QkmQ.jpg"],"paid":false,"views":279,"collection":{"alias":"chaff","title":"Chaff","description":"B E T A  for \u003ca href=\"https://bilge.world\"\u003eThe Psalms\u003c/a\u003e","style_sheet":"","public":false,"views":386,"email":"chaff-q49up6nip5zhcccc6p0frcphub@writeas.com","url":"https://chaff.writeas.com/","monetization_pointer":"","total_posts":0}},{"id":"q5qd6rgo1vt1sn3n","slug":"test","appearance":"norm","language":"en","rtl":false,"type":"post","created":"1994-01-28T00:09:56Z","updated":"2021-08-26T17:23:55Z","title":"Test","body":"```markdown\nThis is actually a somewhat functional page.

It was my second or third time flunking MS02 - the Microsoft Office II course - taken on fairly outdated school desktop machines in the 2007-2008 era, all running Windows XP. Because of some inexplicable ability to simply do what I was told, I would spend class periods trying to create the largest possible text file in Notepad by copying and pasting huge, exponentially growing globs. Eventually, I did crash a machine at least once. Though it could very well be simply the self-exaggerated recollection of preteendom, I even remember crashing the school server with one of those files. They were ginormous for plaintext.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/draftsapp/status/1492645727729766400\n\nMy Text Fucking reached its peak proliferation in [the Drywall Era](https://drywallmusic.tumblr.com), when I first discovered the magic of Zalgo Text. The original generator at eemo.net has been replaced by an exact duplicate at [eeemo.net](http://eeemo.net). I have actually managed to successfully duplicate it [on my own NeoCities website](https://davidblue.wtf/zalgo/), as well. You might say that this original Zalgo Generator is The Original Text Fucking Tool. It can still generate quantities of fucked digital text information that *will* Fuck Shit Up on any social network, and as far as I can tell, the entire program is contained within [a single HTML file](https://davidblue.wtf/zalgo/index.html).\n\nhttps://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/1492783081593483266\n\nAs Drywallbmy definition from [the bs **Text Fucking** *verb*\na.) hardcore text manipulation.\nb.) destruction of usable digital text.\n\nI wonbforemost authorities.\n\nMy [project to properly document Bluetooth keyboard support on iPhone](https://uikeycommand.com) has given me a new reverence for accessibility, generally, which might come as a hypocritical statement at the beginning of such a piece, but I *did* [explicitly ask you](https://mastodon.social/@DavidBlue/107589034582138302) if you felt this subject was anti-accessibility before I officially embarked upon writing This Post. I don't consider the answer - a very weak \"no\" - to be an all-encompassing excuse, whatsoever. If you feel this post's existence has the potential to do real harm, [contact me](https://davidblue.wtf/db.vcf) and I *will* straight up take it down. I dare you. Since I consider myself a genuine authority on Text Fucking, however, I am going to do my best to main unapologetic language when expressing opinions in orbit of the matter.
