Because my CMS is Markdown-native to the core, any specific content URL (like [this page](https:\/\/bilge.world\/archive.md), for example) can be appended with either `.md` or `.json` to see its source.\n\n### eBook\n\nThanks to [Write.as' brilliant eBook generation feature](https:\/\/discuss.write.as\/t\/ebook-add-on\/1271), you can tell this (and any) Write.as blog to generate a `.epub`-formatted archive of its live contents by appending `.epub` to the end of its url [*like this*](https:\/\/bilge.world\/.epub).\n\nI turned this process into [a Siri Shortcut](https:\/\/routinehub.co\/shortcut\/14273) (mostly for the novelty) if you've got an iOS\/iPadOS\/macOS-running device.\n\n### API\n\nI'm proud to say that [Write.as' API](https:\/\/developers.write.as\/docs\/api) was the target of my very first Big Boy API call, not so long ago. If you're new to the concept and curious, try running the command below in just about any command line:\n\n`curl -v -X GET https:\/\/write.as\/api\/collections\/bilge\/posts`\n\n...or you could just view [the response from my last time around](https:\/\/davidblue.wtf\/data\/bilge.json).\n\nhttps:\/\/gist.github.com\/extratone\/3811b19465a80da6e60fd1563ed2e3e8","views":479,"updated":"2023-12-22T02:32:53Z","tags":[],"type":null,"title":"Archive","slug":"archive","appearance":"norm","language":"en","rtl":false,"created":"1994-02-16T06:15:08Z","collection":{"public":false,"alias":"bilge","total_posts":0,"title":"The Psalms","verification_link":"","description":"A <a href=\"https:\/\/davidblue.wtf\/db.vcf\">narcoleptic yokel<\/a> on software and culture.","style_sheet":"","views":177027,"monetization_pointer":""},"paid":false},{"id":"wywk9zdeiqytq0bv","body":"Considering my use of Git as a means to track revisions on my own writing, it's important to note that you should feel free to replace all instances of \"software\" in the statement below with \"words,\" \"writing,\" \"expression,\" etc.\n\nWhile I appreciate tremendously the work and contribution of [Arlo Bendiken](https:\/\/ar.to\/2010\/01\/set-your-code-free) in the form of The Unlicense, I would like to add that I see no need, personally, to make the refutation of Intellectual Property law regarding my own work into some profound ethical statement. As it stands, I have not to my knowledge been the victim of any sort of theft of any kind, and find the suggestion highly unlikely. If I *am*  made aware of such a case, there is certainly a possibility that I may change my mind on this issue, so I suppose I should highlight that **THESE TERMS ARE SUBJECT TO CHANGE**, though I suspect I would be more flattered and\/or amused than actually offended. \n\nI would also like to annotate that my use of this license should not be regarded as a suggestion that anyone else follow my example, or that I \"believe in\" taking such action regarding one's work, generally. While I did indeed take the time to set up [a repository](https:\/\/github.com\/extratone\/eoi) of John Perry Barlow's \"[The Economy of Ideas](https:\/\/www.wired.com\/1994\/03\/economy-ideas\/)\" in a bunch of different document formats, I do not necessarily agree with all of what he argued, especially in the context of the world 27 years later. If you *are* particularly interested in my opinion on the matter for whatever reason, here is what I have to say to you:\n\nThe principled beginning of The Open Web was a great moment in history, but - like all historical principles - it is extremely important that we consider *context* and maintain an appropriate level of criticism when looking back on old manifestos written by old white guys. In general, try your best to *be reasonable*.\n\n***\n\nThis is free and unencumbered software released into the public domain.\n\nAnyone is free to copy, modify, publish, use, compile, sell, or\ndistribute this software, either in source code form or as a compiled\nbinary, for any purpose, commercial or non-commercial, and by any\nmeans.\n\nIn jurisdictions that recognize copyright laws, the author or authors\nof this software dedicate any and all copyright interest in the\nsoftware to the public domain.

So those of you that know the “standard” can keep your mouths shut and bask in the quiet satisfaction that you’re saving the planet.  \n\nThe truth is, for those of you that don’t know, driving “stick” is totally simple. Once you understand the basic concepts of how the transmission and clutch work together, you can figure it out with no real instruction at all.

Really.\n\nMind you, I’m not talking about Dual-Clutch Transmissions, SMGs (Sequential Manual Gearboxes,) or any of that fancy stuff that has only recently become somewhat popular in the mainstream (affordable) auto market. I’m talking about automatics with a torque converter, that magically inefficient device that has carried America’s laziness in driving for the last 50 years.\n\nNow before I go on, I suppose I owe you a technical explanation. Let’s start with the basics. First off, a transmission is the device that separates the engine from the wheels. With both automatic and manual transmissions, “gears” are used to vary the ratio between the engine’s crankshaft and the drive shaft going to the wheels. It’s essentially a buffer between the engine’s relative consistency and the inconsistent world that you drive in. \n\n![Automatic Gearbox Abstract](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/U2c418j.png) \n\nBut that’s not quite all there is.  \n\nTraditional transmissions require an interruption in power from the engine to shift these “gears,” and to come to a stop at a traffic light, in your driveway, or on the side of the highway to pick up a hooker. In manuals, this is typically accomplished with a clutch, a device that could most simply be explained as two plates that are pressed together to couple, and brought apart to become independent. A clutch is normally coupled, it’s when the clutch petal is pushed in that the plates separate, and the transmission is isolated from the engine. Automatic transmissions use a type of fluid coupling to accomplish the same task, called a torque converter.  \n\nThe advantage of the latter is that, when paired with an automatic transmission, the driver only requires one input to get the car moving and vary its velocity, and that is the accelerator pedal. A manual transmission requires three inputs, on the other hand. (Accelerator pedal, clutch, and gearshift.) In my mind, the torque converter has some huge disadvantages in a world where millions are spent to save 20 lbs. on one car design.  \n\nHave you ever noticed that cars equipped with manuals are usually noticeably more fuel efficient than their automatic counterparts? Some of that could be attributed to the greater control that comes with manuals, but most of it is from the torque converter’s main design flaw. A clutch can be completely disengaged and completely engaged. So, with a healthy vehicle, there is 0% of the engine’s power moving to the transmission when the clutch pedal is depressed fully. Likewise when the clutch pedal is allowed completely out, the clutch essentially becomes a shaft, and 100% of the engine’s power is being fed to the transmission. \n\nA torque converter couples via fluid, however, meaning **there is never a solid mechanical connection between the engine and the transmission**. (Unless the transmission is equipped with a lock-up clutch, which is essentially a clutch that locks the torque converter mechanically when it is no longer required to dump the engine’s energy into friction. These are becoming more and more common, but the majority of vehicles on the road are missing them.) This means that a traditional torque converter is **never 100% efficient**.  \n\nAlso, a torque converter is never completely disengaged. When sitting at a traffic light, the driver typically lightly applies the brakes to hold the car from moving forward. Have you ever considered what you’re doing? The engine is basically dumping energy into the torque converter in the form of friction. It is literally no different from holding the gas and the brakes at the same time.  \n\nWhat the hell? How is that accepted in a world where Al Gore and Prius’s exist? \n\nOh wait! As United States citizens, we’re lazy as shit! \n\n**84% of cars sold in North America are equipped with an automatic transmission, as opposed to 20% in Europe**. \n\nYou could make the excuse that we love automatics because of all our stop-and-go traffic, and yet, as a citizen of the Midwestern U.S, I see automatics MUCH more often than I see traffic congestion.  \n\nThe real answer is that we just don’t want to bother with a clutch pedal and a gearshift when we could be texting or doing makeup. \n\nLuckily, the great minds of our time have come up with solutions that adapt to us so that we don’t have to adapt to them. (As always.) Probably the simplest is the aforementioned “lock-up clutch,” which eliminates the inefficiency of the torque converter by mechanically coupling at high speed. But that doesn’t exactly solve the problem of sitting over a nice gas to friction converter at traffic lights.  \nWell here’s a tip. When you stop at a traffic light, bump your shift lever one up into neutral. It shouldn’t require that you hold a safety button to go back and forth between Drive and Neutral. This prevents that unnecessary friction. Combine that with a lockup clutch, and you’re basically driving a manual!……Except without the enjoyment. \n\nYou could call this a rant on one of the most successful inventions the modern automobile has ever seen….because it is. And I doubt you’ll hear anyone else complain about it. But there really are flaws in the design that I wish consumers would figure out. Before all this hybridism, eco-mindedness, and hippie-crazed green malarkey, maybe we should eliminate the evil energy-wasting beast that is the torque converter.\n\n#auto","views":244,"updated":"2022-10-07T19:43:53Z","tags":["auto"],"type":null,"title":"Automatics Suck","slug":"automatic-transmission-inefficiency","appearance":"norm","language":"en","rtl":false,"created":"2011-07-14T06:04:40Z","images":["https:\/\/i.snap.as\/U2c418j.png"],"collection":{"public":false,"alias":"bilge","total_posts":0,"title":"The Psalms","verification_link":"","description":"A <a href=\"https:\/\/davidblue.wtf\/db.vcf\">narcoleptic yokel<\/a> on software and culture.","style_sheet":"","views":177027,"monetization_pointer":""},"paid":false},{"id":"ezu59u4g5gc4mta2","body":"## America's favorite drivetrain is not ideal.\n\nUs drivers of cars with manual transmissions tend to look down on those who drive automatics.

This means that a traditional torque converter is **never 100% efficient**.  \n\nAlso, a torque converter is never completely disengaged. When sitting at a traffic light, the driver typically lightly applies the brakes to hold the car from moving forward. Have you ever considered what you’re doing? The engine is basically dumping energy into the torque converter in the form of friction. It is literally no different from holding the gas and the brakes at the same time.  \n\nWhat the hell? How is that accepted in a world where Al Gore and Prius’s exist? \n\nOh wait! As United States citizens, we’re lazy as shit! \n\n**84% of cars sold in North America are equipped with an automatic transmission, as opposed to 20% in Europe**. \n\nYou could make the excuse that we love automatics because of all our stop-and-go traffic, and yet, as a citizen of the Midwestern U.S, I see automatics MUCH more often than I see traffic congestion.  \n\nThe real answer is that we just don’t want to bother with a clutch pedal and a gearshift when we could be texting or doing makeup. \n\nLuckily, the great minds of our time have come up with solutions that adapt to us so that we don’t have to adapt to them. (As always.) Probably the simplest is the aforementioned “lock-up clutch,” which eliminates the inefficiency of the torque converter by mechanically coupling at high speed. But that doesn’t exactly solve the problem of sitting over a nice gas to friction converter at traffic lights.  \nWell here’s a tip. When you stop at a traffic light, bump your shift lever one up into neutral. It shouldn’t require that you hold a safety button to go back and forth between Drive and Neutral. This prevents that unnecessary friction. Combine that with a lockup clutch, and you’re basically driving a manual!……Except without the enjoyment. \n\nYou could call this a rant on one of the most successful inventions the modern automobile has ever seen….because it is. And I doubt you’ll hear anyone else complain about it. But there really are flaws in the design that I wish consumers would figure out. Before all this hybridism, eco-mindedness, and hippie-crazed green malarkey, maybe we should eliminate the evil energy-wasting beast that is the torque converter.\n\n<!--comment-->\n\n#auto","views":2,"updated":"2024-01-07T18:24:08Z","tags":["auto"],"type":null,"title":"Automatics Suck","slug":"automatic-transmission-horror","appearance":"norm","language":"en","rtl":false,"created":"2011-07-14T17:23:28Z","images":["https:\/\/i.snap.as\/U2c418j.png"],"collection":{"public":false,"alias":"dieselgoth","total_posts":0,"title":"Dieselgoth","verification_link":"","description":"An ongoing cultural commentary through the lens of an automobile-centric headspace.","style_sheet":"","views":22,"monetization_pointer":""},"paid":false},{"id":"r1klmmkbc0ubq4hp","body":"![2013 Mazda MX-5 - Full](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/RIl7x6g.jpeg)\n\n## As we bid farewell to the Miata’s third-generation, sizing up its top trim summarizes its legacy.\n\n<!--more-->\n\nI recently had the chance to drive the facelifted 2013 Mazda MX-5. This is the first time the looks of the perky roadster have changed since the front-mounted smile became an all-out grin of insanity in 2008. They have once again dulled it to what I would call a smirk. The new front end blends with the rest of car more than it has in the past. It seems to have grown a bit more serious.

The MX-5 was never intended to look serious. That grin was there to convey the primary attribute aspired to by its creators; joy. It's designed to be joyful in driving and the exterior of previous generations did a good job of communicating what the car is all about. Unfortunately, it seems they have decided that it's time for the roadster to grow up. Frankly, that's not going to work.\n\nNow, to the drive.\n\nFor this year, the car has been lightened, the braking response quickened, as well as the throttle response in manual-equipped cars. Unfortunately, I was only able to drive the 6-speed automatic with optional pattle-shifters. Given that this is my first drive in an NC (third generation) MX-5, I can only compare it to my own NB.\n\n![2013 Mazda MX-5 - Trunk](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/AwmhWqh.jpeg)\n\nImmediately, my passenger and chaperon starts the process of opening the optional retractable hard top. Open air is this car's natural environment, and it appears that somebody got busy making sure its occupants never notice. Wind buffeting has been drastically reduced. We were able to maintain conversation beyond 70mph without necessitating shouting thanks to a much taller wind brake behind our seats. Unfortunately, I couldn't really hear much of anything from the 158-hp 2.0L 4 up front, even with liberal amounts of right foot burying. It would seem the optional dual exhaust outlets are rather pointless then.\n\n![2013 Mazda MX-5 - Engine](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/jF3z0Qc.jpeg)\n\nGetting in the car, I had expected the experience to be ruined by the 6-speed auto. Buying a Miata with an automatic is sort of like going on a scenic vacation without a camera. It doesn't necessarily ruin the immediate experience but you'll always have some regret regarding the subject in the future. The pattles add some of the fun back in, but I prefer the Golf GTI's arrangement of right side-shift up, left side-shift down, while the MX-5 has both functions on either side of the wheel.\n\nIt took some deliberate self-coaching to get used to, but it won't effect your daily driving experience. Another plus; when in manual shift mode, it is truly manual, meaning the transmission will allow you to exceed the redline. It may sound trivial, but being nannied when you're first told that you're in control can be a major annoyance. (Looking at you, Kia Forte.) It's disappointing that Mazda chose only to up throttle response in manual-equipped cars. This one most certainly needed it.\n\nThe original Miata was built on a philosophy of communication between driver and machine, summarized in the Japanese phrase “Jinba Ittai,” meaning “rider and horse are one.” Being an MX-5 owner, this philosophy is very important to me, thus my expectations for the steering were very high. It was very disappointing, then, to discover that it has been very nearly ruined.\n\n![2013 Mazda MX-5 - Driver’s Side](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/dLg41pi.jpeg)\n\nThe leather-wrapped steering wheel was comfortable, yes, but not very generous in revealing the road. In corners it felt jumpy, imprecise, and unsure of itself. The same lack of self-confidence was noticeable in a straight line as well, along with a nervous fidget. Keep in mind, I am comparing this to roadsters of the past, not to other automobiles currently on the market. It would take a global nuclear war to make the MX-5 less fun to drive than a Toyota Camry.\n\nThough it has lost communication and soul, the Miata has gained a more comfortable suspension and oodles of storage space. The trunk is massive for a roadster of this size, and the example I drove was equipped with an optional storage compartment extending behind the seats, especially handy for CDs, candy, and the like. The center console contains two reasonably-sized cupholders obscured by a sliding door that will inevitably lead to annoyance in single-drink occasions. Mr. Cunningham also pointed out to me that the track on which the door slides appears vulnerable to crumbs. Only time will tell, I suppose.\n\n![2013 Mazda MX-5 - Center Console](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/fTXsEEn.jpeg)\n\nIn general, being inside the car is a much more comfortable experience, albeit a boring one. It seems to me that the MX-5 has “grown up,” forgoing fun for comfort and practicality. And is that not exactly the opposite of the direction it should be moving? It was never meant to be an aggressive-looking performance car, and it will never do well as one. It will never be luxurious enough to be a true touring car, either.\n\nIts soul has made it the top-selling roadster of all time, and I'm afraid it's losing it, bit by bit. To be honest, if you're attracted by the values on which the original Miata was built, I would recommend a Subaru BRZ\/Toyota GT 86\/Scion FR-S. The recommendation does not come lightly or easily.\n\nUntil Mazda gets wise about what it's doing to the beloved little car, I'm afraid it's headed down a path that will mean losing a grip on the niche it's held for so long, and that's quite saddening.\n\n#auto","views":261,"updated":"2022-03-09T08:49:31Z","tags":["auto"],"type":null,"title":"Last Year of the NC: 2013 Mazda MX-5 Club Review","slug":"mazda-mx5-club-review","appearance":"norm","language":"en","rtl":false,"created":"2012-10-11T06:03:37Z","images":["https:\/\/i.snap.as\/RIl7x6g.jpeg","https:\/\/i.snap.as\/edJ18j9.jpeg","https:\/\/i.snap.as\/AwmhWqh.jpeg","https:\/\/i.snap.as\/jF3z0Qc.jpeg","https:\/\/i.snap.as\/dLg41pi.jpeg","https:\/\/i.snap.as\/fTXsEEn.jpeg"],"collection":{"public":false,"alias":"bilge","total_posts":0,"title":"The Psalms","verification_link":"","description":"A <a href=\"https:\/\/davidblue.wtf\/db.vcf\">narcoleptic yokel<\/a> on software and culture.","style_sheet":"","views":177027,"monetization_pointer":""},"paid":false},{"id":"1kx15hpgv5nt1p2u","body":"![2013 Mazda MX-5 - Full](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/RIl7x6g.jpeg)\n\n## As we bid farewell to the Miata’s third-generation, sizing up its top trim summarizes its legacy.\n\n<!--more-->\n\nI recently had the chance to drive the facelifted 2013 Mazda MX-5.

Not the greatest time for the United States auto industry. In those days, with a few exceptions, American cars were all overpriced, devoid of quality and generally unreliable. The big three (along with many other non-automotive related corporations in the U.S.) had an aging generation of management. This group decided that the ideal way to run their business involved expending the least amount of effort into their products as possible, without reducing the price paid by customers. Essentially, they hoped to gain more profit from less product. I don't have to tell you that this thinking just...doesn't work. I would theorize that this mentality came from overconfidence and a lack of joy in production. GM, Ford, and Dodge had been the top sellers of the automobile in the United States since its invention. They originally symbolized the best in quality, luxury and performance. Consumer and producer shared the same values, resulting in a flourishing market. It was a joyous time. And then, somewhere around the 1973 oil crisis, the joy began seeping out of our star shooters. Maybe it was emissions regulations, a loss of those ideal values, or some other factor. Regardless of the source, our homegrown auto industry lost its passion. It reflected in the cars that were built. Designs were reused, progression was halted, the irreverence of quality workmanship lost. “American dependability” became an ironic statement.\n\nAnd then came along a company that had been building little, noisy two-stroke engines to fit to bicycles only four decades earlier, proudly displaying a banner the changing public couldn't refuse. They offered a product that was simple, honest, reliable, durable and reasonably priced. A concoction that smelled an awful lot like high value. An odor that no doubt brought back old memories. The Accord, suburban America's new family pet. And the Civic, conveniently debuted in 1972. The college student's greatest companion. Both were conservatively styled and equipped, and thus quite easily ignored, which was exactly what the country wanted. After all those years stranded on the shoulders of our aging interstate system in lumbering, underpowered beasts, the indestructible and dependable qualities of the Hondas came as a breath of fresh air. So. What made the newcomers so different? What was the driving force behind the value of the products? It was something not unknown to the Americans, and its presence had been sorely missed. Picture an ancient sage by the name of Soichiro Honda saying something to the order of “Lets build the best automobile we can and sell it for as little as possible.” Though the man is more a symbol than an actual influence on the four-wheeled endeavors of the institution bearing his name, he represents what led to the same group's success. Honda was untainted by an unrealistic attitude, and unaided by a century of heritage and good reputation. They succeeded only because they built good cars.\n\n![Accord Mark One](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/C5R7hZa.jpeg)\n\nBy 2008, Honda had more than made a name for itself. Over the past decade, though, the prices had been steadily increasing, along with the level of luxury and complexity available in their cars. Both the Accord and Civic were bestsellers in their respective classes, and had held their titles for a relatively long time. It was then that I personally theorized they might take the same path American carmakers had taken only a short while before. I don't want to brag, but this was long before Ron Kiino's bold title “Is Hyundai the new Honda?” graced the pages of MotorTrend's October 2011 issue. And it was really a far-fetched notion at the time. Simply a suspicion. Confidently and stubbornly, the Accord held its grip on mid-size sedan sales in the United States, complimented by the Toyota Camry, a similar-looking but even more ignorable competitor. The former still held appeal for someone with the capacity to enjoy themselves. The latter, however, has always been the most desirable choice of individuals that absolutely despise driving. They both held their slightly different niches, with no real fear of losing their place. Then, Honda started skimping a bit on quality. Motoring journalists noticed a lack of improving fuel economy, aging transmissions, and a general loss in competitive edge in the 2011 Accord. Not the best time to start slacking on Honda's part.\n\n![Sonata Front](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/JwoqLyt.jpeg)\n\nThis was the year that Hyundai unveiled the brilliantly-updated 6th generation Sonata. I consider this to be the most significant car to come in the mid-sized segment since the birth of the Accord\/Camry duo. In previous generations, it had always been competitively priced. The quality, though, had been lacking. The Koreans were not afraid to design a car that was much less conservative than the two Japanese giants. However, the designs were never really all that great looking. Interesting and different? Yes. Attractive?....No. So these attributes kept Honda and Toyota secure under their cozy comforter of sales, not intimidated by Hyundai's offering. And that's quite understandable. The Sonata never really seemed a direct competitor to the giants. The new one, however, completely changed the game. For one thing, it's gorgeous. Not conservatively pretty, but ridiculous, in the best sort of way. Poised and angular, the exterior looks as if it should cost exponentially more than it does. They managed to carry on the Sonata's tradition of unique styling by rejecting the old car completely and replacing it with a stunner. The interior reflects a similar attitude. It's not only good looking, but significantly more fuel efficient than any other mid-sized car on the market. The drivetrain options are excellent. The best part, though, is the price. At a starting MSRP of 19,195 USD (£11,944), it is several thousand less than any competitor.\n\n![Sonata Interior](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/s3Kfq8g.jpeg)\n\nAll of this really just makes the Accord and Camry look silly. It's interesting that Hyundai should take up Honda's original niche, given how different their backgrounds are. Our original hero of practicality was created by a man tinkering with small motorcycles. The former, however, was founded as a massive construction firm, only later trying its hand in the realm of automobiles. Cars seemed an alternative for Hyundai, but certainly not an afterthought. Regardless of where they came from, these two companies have had very similar philosophies, if only separated by time. Also, both have had to rely on sheer ingenuity for profit, without the foothold of heritage in the American market. It could be said, though, that Hyundai is doing a bit better. High value cars that are practical and interesting as an experience. Honda could never get that last bit quite right. Or perhaps it's just a sign of the times. Maybe Americans have overcome the compulsion to ignore our cars. My question is this; Has this flip-flop in production attitude become a cycle? And if so, who will be in the hot spot next? My bet is on the big three, believe it or not. A new generation of management has brought about a huge improvement in our products. It could even be one of the rising Chinese companies in the future. Who knows? I can tell you that right now, though, Hyundai has got the goods.\n\n#auto","views":260,"updated":"2022-03-09T08:49:38Z","tags":["auto"],"type":null,"title":"Honda: From Trendsetters to Just Another Car Company","slug":"honda-hyundai-auto-industry","appearance":"norm","language":"en","rtl":false,"created":"2012-10-25T06:01:56Z","images":["https:\/\/i.snap.as\/z1ZlwRU.jpeg","https:\/\/i.snap.as\/C5R7hZa.jpeg","https:\/\/i.snap.as\/JwoqLyt.jpeg","https:\/\/i.snap.as\/s3Kfq8g.jpeg"],"collection":{"public":false,"alias":"bilge","total_posts":0,"title":"The Psalms","verification_link":"","description":"A <a href=\"https:\/\/davidblue.wtf\/db.vcf\">narcoleptic yokel<\/a> on software and culture.","style_sheet":"","views":177027,"monetization_pointer":""},"paid":false},{"id":"srn72jnaewl3s3iu","body":"![Accord Front](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/z1ZlwRU.jpeg)\n\n## South Korea is poised to take Japan's place in the American market.\n\n<!--more-->\n\nThe 1990s.

Regardless of where they came from, these two companies have had very similar philosophies, if only separated by time. Also, both have had to rely on sheer ingenuity for profit, without the foothold of heritage in the American market. It could be said, though, that Hyundai is doing a bit better. High value cars that are practical and interesting as an experience. Honda could never get that last bit quite right. Or perhaps it's just a sign of the times. Maybe Americans have overcome the compulsion to ignore our cars. My question is this; Has this flip-flop in production attitude become a cycle? And if so, who will be in the hot spot next? My bet is on the big three, believe it or not. A new generation of management has brought about a huge improvement in our products. It could even be one of the rising Chinese companies in the future. Who knows? I can tell you that right now, though, Hyundai has got the goods.\n\n<!--comment-->\n\n#opinion","views":0,"updated":"2024-01-07T18:28:19Z","tags":["opinion"],"type":null,"title":"Honda: From Trendsetters to Just Another Car Company","slug":"hyundai-new-honda","appearance":"norm","language":"en","rtl":false,"created":"2012-10-26T17:27:34Z","images":["https:\/\/i.snap.as\/z1ZlwRU.jpeg","https:\/\/i.snap.as\/C5R7hZa.jpeg","https:\/\/i.snap.as\/JwoqLyt.jpeg","https:\/\/i.snap.as\/s3Kfq8g.jpeg"],"collection":{"public":false,"alias":"dieselgoth","total_posts":0,"title":"Dieselgoth","verification_link":"","description":"An ongoing cultural commentary through the lens of an automobile-centric headspace.","style_sheet":"","views":22,"monetization_pointer":""},"paid":false},{"id":"cvimtzrd212g2b24","body":"<iframe width=\"360\" height=\"240\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/Ic6SoJFW7Zc?controls=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe>\n\n*A broken Mazda RX-7, that lived in a shed on the family farm, was David Blue's first real experience with a car.

A 1980 model LS-trimmed example, originally painted in “Solar Gold” (one of only 500 made, it turns out). It had been sitting in a small shed, condemned to rest there only a few years after my birth from issues with the fuel delivery system. The search for a mechanic capable of working on the rotary engine without destroying it was eventually given up.\n\nMy father told me stories of his flings with the car. He used to say the police would pull him over simply because it “looked fast.” Naturally, as a small boy, the stories took a hold of my imagination. The RX-7 held a very special sort of allure. It eventually became my ideal image of “racecar”. Its environment added to the intoxication. The lack of electric power to the car, its immobility, and the stories I was told combined to create the aura of a fading, forgotten superhero. Tired, abandoned, and only necessitating the help of a friend in order to bring it back to glory.\n\nIt wasn't very long after toddlerhood that I took to spending a large portion of my free time sitting in the RX-7, practicing rowing through the gears and making engine noises with my mouth. I still remember vividly how delightful the experience of simply sitting in that car was. The dash layout, the feel of the steering wheel in my hands, and the smell of the interior are all deeply etched into memory. It was almost as if I had a deeper perception into its soul, a capability that I feel has been lost.\n\nMuch before I had expected, I had the opportunity to meet this hero, so to speak. I encountered a partially-restored 1983 Series 2 example, slightly different than my RX-7. Different enough to subdue my worries of adultery to the car I grew up with, but similar enough to be an important discovery.\n\nI was treated to the complete RX-7 ownership experience, including a dead battery and a difficult, choked cold start. Perry, my host, was kind enough to pay for the fuel for the drive with money out of his own pocket. After ensuring that we would not be walking back, I pointed that very long, very 80s nose toward some local back highways.\n\n![Rx-7 Interior](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/PjS0Ppz.jpg)\n\n![Rx-7](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/3O7jYMJ.jpg)\n\nI had never driven anything powered by a Wankel, and the contrast of the RX-7 compared to everything with wheels I had experienced was stark, and noticeable immediately. The feedback normally received from a piston engine is not felt, due to the fact that there is no more conversion from vertical to rotational motion, a rotary engine (as implied by the name) involves no vertical momentum. It's not that the engine refuses to communicate with you, it's just speaking an entirely different language. The whiny exhaust note has an odd property to it that can be heard from no other source. It conjures up images of the mysterious, angry pair of triangles whirling about in their cage. Purely imaginary, of course.\n\nBecause the Wankel is so smooth, I found myself wondering why I should shift up. A piston engine makes you anxious when you push it close to the redline. Most send the driver a variety of auditory and tactile messages indicating that they must either shift up, or face a molten tie rod to the head. The RX-7, however, gives no such indication. When close to the redline, one hears only an excited whir. The result (forgive the upcoming Disney analogy) is an almost magic carpet-like experience. It's as though the power simply materializes before you with no apparent source or sacrifice.\n\n![Rx-7 Badge](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/veaU2VH.jpg)\n\nFor me, the tranquility of the engine eliminated the reservations I had for speed. It's an incentive, in fact, to keep the needle in the upper portion of the tachometer as much as possible. The car had only 100 hp and 105 lb-ft. of torque in 1983, and has no doubt lost a few along its journey. Frankly, I'm thankful it's not more powerful. Otherwise, there wouldn't be room to fully enjoy revving it to its limit.\n\nThough I have decided that a transmission with multiple ratios is unnecessary when coupled to a Wankel, the 5-speed manual in the RX-7 was quite a treat. It's very notchy, with a mid-length throw. The well-spaced ratios paired with a very light, but engaging clutch made rev matching pleasant and natural.\n\nUnfortunately, the steering in the car I drove was quite loose, likely from wear. It is unassisted, though, and was at one time very engaging, I suspect. Given that it is a sports car from the 1980s, driver communication is a result of the engineering, not vice versa.\n\n![1983 Mazda Rx-7 Series 2](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/OPqjba2.jpg)\n\nThe driving position is actually more relaxed than it looks, and the interior is a thoroughly enjoyable place to be in. This particular car had a factory-installed manually-adjustable equalizer mounted beneath the stock head unit. A useless, though interesting, novelty that quickly rids the occupants of any doubt as to when the car was built.\n\nThe RX-7 is too often overlooked for what it is; a very special piece of automotive history. It's an experience completely unlike any piston-powered alternative. And for me, it's much more than that. My RX-7 represents an entire childhood's worth of dreams and a sort of companionship, even. My experiences with it were a very large influence on my drive to pursue a career in automotive writing.

Everywhere, there were words on the newest Stair Wiggling…everywhere THEY were wiggling… And I was being wit-bitter on the TL. For you, I’d planned on continuing in the usual way, so as not to startle your precious Hans Zimmer-embossed heart.\n\nI’m sure you’re a tolerable being, and there’s nothing you’d rather read less at this hour (whatever hour it may be,) but I really despise going to the movies. I always end up getting sick from the popcorn, which I buy every outing because I have grown weary and weathered, and cannot sit for two straight hours without consuming something, so troubled is my stomach now with Big Boy woes.\n\nI can never escape the ambient breath odor — even in an empty theatre — and I can smell the filth in the seats on my clothes and in my hair until I shower. This is at least an hour-long process, so we’ve racked up a significant trauma bill without even accounting for travel time.\n\n*Furious 7* was the last theatre experience I’d had, and it was a definite exception. Despite watching ten minutes of the ending on YouTube beforehand thanks to much-appreciated warnings from friends, I spent the final few frames before the credit roll honorably combatting the industrial weepy forces in my throat with tripplet labor breathing exercises while my dusty ducts piddled buttery tears all over my jacket.\n\nAs we age, straightforwardly emotional experiences (like watching a movie) become exhaustingly more complex and fickle. I don’t remember ever REALLY disliking a film as a child, for better or worse. I think I genuinely enjoyed all ~40 times I’ve sat through *Cadet Kelly.*\n\n*Star Wars*, though, is a completely different thing.\n\nTo children, chocolate is like water [insert dystopian, but probably more metaphorically effective food example here] — it’s something you’d regularly consume as it is made available. Perhaps some foodists treasured it more, but I wouldn’t bother debating it. *Star Wars*, though, is like chocolate and Corvette. It’s SUCH an indulgence that even children are self-aware enough to recognize it, which is especially notable considering how many individuals I’ve known as they’ve lost nothing BUT their unlimited wanting when they “became” adults.\n\nMetatots aside, it’s important to recognize how integral the IP’s illusion of limitlessness is to its appeal. It is not contained within the future of humanity, near or distant. The stories, characters, species, cultures, and conflicts come from *a long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away*… There is no more perfectly concise introductory sentence to unshackle us from our history and our planet, sparing us from the ridiculously irrational instinct to make comparisons between fictional realities and our own that so plagues and defines the consumption of science fiction.\n\nThese processes are often welcome, of course, but they tether us to ourselves and our familiars, which tends to hinder the complete manifestation of the *ultimate* sense of adventure.\nEven to the most petty plot ponderers, the time and effort it requires to arrive in *Star Wars* with externally-acquired foreknowledge is not a worthwhile investment. This is why so many (including myself) look upon *A New Hope* with such fondness and favoritism — the premier of the universe was at its potential apogee from the start.\n\nThough it is inviting with its ellipses and cooling hue, that title card is actually saying “you don’t know shit about what you’re about to see. Don’t make the mistake of trying to be the first one to dissect it, because you’ll fail, regardless of how cultured or analytically superior you are. From this moment until you see credits, every one of you is an ignorant little child…”\n\nWhen experience cannot possibly be applied, it becomes irrelevant. Without your experiences, you are an infant, waiting for identity. Over that Genesis, the curtains brushed aside any quantity of memories and made theatres into a sort of cultural nursery — clinically levelled playing fields existing in a precision of usefulness that expression will never fulfill again.\n\nThe real cancer of the property is lore, and the parasitic authorities it enables have been unknowingly slurping away its most enchanting (but not exclusive) value since the moment they first pushed through those double-portholed doors and, groggily squinting, brought this supremely strange universe into the dank kernel-littered corridors of our own.\n\nI blame contemporary society’s dependency on compartmentalization for my disappointment in *The Force Awakens*, and, assuming you’re getting on a bit since I’ve kept your attention, you should for yours, too.\n\nI tried my senile best to be passionate about “the new *Star Wars* movie” as December approached, but I don’t think I finished a single web article on the subject. I had begun my brief return to *The Old Republic* when the hilted lightsaber image was leaked and distinctly remember overhearing some very weary VoIP exasperation from my (VERY middle-aged) raid group. “It’s not gonna be the same, but neither was J.J.‘s *Star Trek*, and I liked it…I think.” And it’s not surprising that the conversation eventually turned to the specific mechanics of lightsaber design, chronological positing, and the like, given the context, but it really emphasized for me the magnitude of the history and nostalgia weighing upon the collective dad emotional balance. *A New Hope* had the intended effect on me, of course, but couldn’t possibly imburden itself as it had on those who were in the moment. In their psyche, that experience will be eternally associated with the sense of unlimited potential their childhood ignorance allowed for. These folk who are so often stereotyped as disciples of information have begun to grow weary, and are desperately seeking sanctuary from the mass of all the knowledge they’ve picked up since. Their need made a market; J.J. made a movie. (Well, six.) Today’s moms and dads find their escape in the Roku, not the bar. *The Force Awakens* and the decade of revivalist big-budgeters preceding it are the reformed druggie’s drug.\n\nBecause we both know you haven’t yet read anything you haven’t heard\/read previously, I’ve really just been playing the role of a (more intelligent) Ghandi, but we’ve now finally arrived at some promising insight into the real issue: this culture is one of fatal contradiction. Despite its historical popularity, it’s ill-advisable to want to know by day what you try to forget at night. Since the PT Cruiser was allowed to go on sale, you’ve all been caught up in a nostalgic hellride that can only end with the ultimate destruction of all culture. You now know, definitively, what role *The Force Awakens* was created to perform. Depending on whether or not you welcome the end of everything, it fills it…adequately.\n\nThere are Baddie Red Brits and Cool Brown Moderate Americans in their X-Things, moving swiftly, acting in diversity, and generally heaving moral streaks of energy at the Intolerable Imperialists, just as they should! Sometimes, they yell and die! But it’s ok, because they’re all just loyal martyrs making their obligatory and patriotic sacrifice for the rebellion against the Queen!\n\nUm.\n\nI mean… the Smug Cowards in their big taxation balloon!\n\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"250\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" allow=\"autoplay\" src=\"https:\/\/w.soundcloud.com\/player\/?url=https%3A\/\/api.soundcloud.com\/tracks\/657334106&color=%231125aa&auto_play=true&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&show_teaser=true\"><\/iframe>\n\nI must confess that I did feel something huge when the lights dimmed, the aforementioned disclaimer appeared, and the theme’s jarring introductory chord hit me in the face, beginning the opening crawl. I actually smiled *involuntarily*, which is tremendously embarrassing to admit because the warmth I felt was exactly the sensation that defined my childhood experiences with the franchise. I even had a gigantic model of the *Moderate Fashion*, which would now be worth a lot of money (or so I’m told,) had it not been so damaged in my frivolous storage.\n\nUnfortunately, that frisky feeling of adventure promptly wisped through the screen’s grasp after the “obligatory” scrolling yellow text -> “there’s a big spaceship moving slowly” transition. Aside from the adorably entrancing romantic tension between Timid Traitor and Sentimental Squatter, there was nothing very *Star Wars* about anything I saw. The cards were a deceiving gate into a world that was distinctly NOT *Star Wars*. There’s no need to mess about; it’s clearly an alternate reality from the one we’ve known. J.J.‘s *Star Trek*was in such a way, too, but it was explicitly identified as such by the production. Traditionally, Lucas’ IP wouldn’t necessarily allow for this exemption, but nobody’s been all that vocal in confronting it, to my knowledge.\n\nThe world expected both of these forays to rejuvenate the franchise, which would serve my argument, were it not for the (much preferable) alternative: \n**LET THEM DIE**.\n\nDespite millions of dollars worth of polish, they’ve still ended up feeling like a strange reanimation experiment.\n\nYour son is **DEAD**, Georgino. There are some things man would do better by leaving alone and moving on. Imagine all that cash and creative talent spent on *new ideas* instead of desperate attempts to charm and cultivate the shallowest part of moviegoers’ spectrum. *So much sweat* shed trying to recreate the *new franchise* bewitchment is embarrassingly cowardly when one could just *create a new franchise*.\n\n#film #spectacle","views":900,"updated":"2019-07-27T21:01:09Z","tags":["film","spectacle"],"type":null,"title":"Stairs, Wiggling","slug":"star-wars-the-force-awakens-review","appearance":"norm","language":"en","rtl":false,"created":"2016-01-20T15:00:00Z","images":["https:\/\/i.snap.as\/WZE6gzb.jpeg"],"collection":{"public":false,"alias":"extratone","total_posts":0,"title":"Extratone","verification_link":"","description":"For the New Curious.","style_sheet":"","views":182661,"monetization_pointer":""},"paid":false},{"id":"daiirwsg2x37trmo","body":"![Fin from The Star War](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/WZE6gzb.jpeg)\n\n<!--more-->\n\n<audio controls>\n  <source src=\"https:\/\/github.com\/extratone\/bilge\/raw\/main\/audio\/TTS\/stairswiggling.m4a\">\n<\/audio>\n\n'Twas was the night after Christmas (I think,) and I was in the same scroogy mood I must maintain for consistency of appearances *&* equilibrium of family dynamics every year.

Today’s moms and dads find their escape in the Roku, not the bar. *The Force Awakens* and the decade of revivalist big-budgeters preceding it are the reformed druggie’s drug.\n\nBecause we both know you haven’t yet read anything you haven’t heard\/read previously, I’ve really just been playing the role of a (more intelligent) Ghandi, but we’ve now finally arrived at some promising insight into the real issue: this culture is one of fatal contradiction. Despite its historical popularity, it’s ill-advisable to want to know by day what you try to forget at night. Since the PT Cruiser was allowed to go on sale, you’ve all been caught up in a nostalgic hellride that can only end with the ultimate destruction of all culture. You now know, definitively, what role *The Force Awakens* was created to perform. Depending on whether or not you welcome the end of everything, it fills it…adequately.\n\nThere are Baddie Red Brits and Cool Brown Moderate Americans in their X-Things, moving swiftly, acting in diversity, and generally heaving moral streaks of energy at the Intolerable Imperialists, just as they should! Sometimes, they yell and die! But it’s ok, because they’re all just loyal martyrs making their obligatory and patriotic sacrifice for the rebellion against the Queen!\n\nUm.\n\nI mean… the Smug Cowards in their big taxation balloon!\n\nI must confess that I did feel something huge when the lights dimmed, the aforementioned disclaimer appeared, and the theme’s jarring introductory chord hit me in the face, beginning the opening crawl. I actually smiled *involuntarily*, which is tremendously embarrassing to admit because the warmth I felt was exactly the sensation that defined my childhood experiences with the franchise. I even had a gigantic model of the *Moderate Fashion*, which would now be worth a lot of money (or so I’m told,) had it not been so damaged in my frivolous storage.\n\nUnfortunately, that frisky feeling of adventure promptly wisped through the screen’s grasp after the “obligatory” scrolling yellow text -> “there’s a big spaceship moving slowly” transition. Aside from the adorably entrancing romantic tension between Timid Traitor and Sentimental Squatter, there was nothing very *Star Wars* about anything I saw. The cards were a deceiving gate into a world that was distinctly NOT *Star Wars*. There’s no need to mess about; it’s clearly an alternate reality from the one we’ve known. J.J.‘s *Star Trek*was in such a way, too, but it was explicitly identified as such by the production. Traditionally, Lucas’ IP wouldn’t necessarily allow for this exemption, but nobody’s been all that vocal in confronting it, to my knowledge.\n\nThe world expected both of these forays to rejuvenate the franchise, which would serve my argument, were it not for the (much preferable) alternative: \n**LET THEM DIE**.\n\nDespite millions of dollars worth of polish, they’ve still ended up feeling like a strange reanimation experiment.\n\nYour son is **DEAD**, Georgino. There are some things man would do better by leaving alone and moving on. Imagine all that cash and creative talent spent on *new ideas* instead of desperate attempts to charm and cultivate the shallowest part of moviegoers’ spectrum. *So much sweat* shed trying to recreate the *new franchise* bewitchment is embarrassingly cowardly when one could just *create a new franchise*.\n\n#film","views":574,"updated":"2022-03-09T08:49:58Z","tags":["film"],"type":null,"title":"Stairs, Wiggling","slug":"star-wars-the-force-awakens-review","appearance":"norm","language":"en","rtl":false,"created":"2016-01-20T15:00:00Z","images":["https:\/\/i.snap.as\/WZE6gzb.jpeg"],"collection":{"public":false,"alias":"bilge","total_posts":0,"title":"The Psalms","verification_link":"","description":"A <a href=\"https:\/\/davidblue.wtf\/db.vcf\">narcoleptic yokel<\/a> on software and culture.","style_sheet":"","views":177027,"monetization_pointer":""},"paid":false},{"id":"24mmk2zndrpw0vbf","body":"![Lupus Missouri, Weathermatic Dual 35](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/HqsWUQV.jpeg)\nI am as far away as one can get from seabreeze and sun in between greencliff and saltwater\nand cycling sound,\nregular\nstatic but brushed by a flag of soft curls\n\nI am so long from brief downtime moments of contented overwatching of the familial you only know, then\n\nPerhaps I've even permanently shunned myself from smelling comfort in a study haven, occasionally pinning silly smiles to friend or lover\n\nCertainly, I am now to be given up on and delegatorly relegated to Strangest Smuck of Locale\n\nAs to the girls, I am either blowing or falling away from any expectation of reciprocity, perhaps\nits only remarkable because of the contact my body is detecting deficit of with the mess of Her-related sensory input my brain continues to withdraw from without healing,\nlike a standing retreat\n\nor defiant creed that I can still convince most of us of enough\nthat they fall in love with me\nand realize that It is for Her\nand are broken by it\nto varying degrees\nwhile I watch and know that I would be disgusted\nwth myself utterly,\nif I could feel anything\n\nBut when I do,\nit is GAPING wide\nfor some reason always dramatized as a vacant bar graph in my mind\n\n#poetry","views":430,"updated":"2019-07-29T11:58:52Z","tags":["poetry"],"type":null,"title":"Jacksonville Beach","slug":"jacksonville-beach-lupus-missouri-david-blue","appearance":"norm","language":"en","rtl":false,"created":"2016-05-08T11:00:00Z","images":["https:\/\/i.snap.as\/HqsWUQV.jpeg"],"collection":{"public":false,"alias":"bilge","total_posts":0,"title":"The Psalms","verification_link":"","description":"A <a href=\"https:\/\/davidblue.wtf\/db.vcf\">narcoleptic yokel<\/a> on software and culture.","style_sheet":"","views":177027,"monetization_pointer":""},"paid":false},{"id":"gg3q04wo4v635znm","body":"![Separate But Equal](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/q1ODGIM.jpg)\n\n## In revisiting Disney movies from our childhoods, we stumbled upon a good number of surprisingly insightful sentiments about race and class.\n\n<!--more-->\n\n<audio controls>\n  <source src=\"https:\/\/github.com\/extratone\/bilge\/raw\/main\/audio\/TTS\/JohnnyTsunami.m4a\">\n<\/audio>\n\nIn the late 1990s, when the dwindling cocaine generation of American high corporate executives had long since left their misogynistic glory days in the Disco era, their ruthlessness peaked.

And gee - you certainly didn't write to sell; selling hadn't occurred to you at all for a very long time, but from just one search, you find Our Friend, back from his own experiences as an author and editor, qualified and insistent that you *can* make money selling creative works of fiction.\n\nAnd Jesus Christ… All that said, I must admit to you that I've just finished Kurt Vonnegut's *Breakfast of Champions*, and was unable to commence this “review” without wondering aloud for you how Kilgore Trout - perhaps Kurt's favorite creation - would feel about this Friend's business.\n\nIt was actually my Aunt Ayn who taught me to write, so Vonegutt was a mediocre Ray William Johnson-associated [YouTube band](https:\/\/youtu.be\/zAtBEhKU7uw) until after high school, when \"lots of people\" started telling me to \"read Vonnegut, man,\" even though I cannot recall any specific events or recommenders. For whatever reason, though, I'd bought a copy immediately after a friend mentioned it, recently, and found him (in this particular work, at least) to be awfully sane for my taste, yet particularly resonant. Though written to make me think it was all a big one-draft ramble, Kurt's a bit too curt for it to be believed, I think. Auntie Rand would've double-taken his beratement of \"in nonsense is strength\" if she'd made it that far. I hope she did, because I found the image of her taking in his occasional hand doodles to be very amusing.\n\nDwayne Hoover is awfully absent - and therefore, a very versatile storytelling device, though not in a lazy sense. We're repeatedly notified about an imminent convergence. Eventually, it's explained that the endgame involves Dwayne exploding into a violent revengeful tantrum against all the lifelong enemies of his subconscious. Including \"people with brown skin.\" Can I just bring up Ayn Rand again? I hope it's okay.\n\nKilgore Trout is the most dangerous villain I've ever experienced. He has little to lose, and - like Vonnegut, it would seem - finds his observatory position in the world to be immensely amusing. His last amusement, even. Remember Ellsworth M. Toohey, the corrupter? I think they would've gotten along, funny enough.\n\nYes, and Hoover would be Peter Keating, the corrupted. I'm reaching, yeah, but when do I not? Their immediate difference is the lack of malicious intent in Trout, of course. He is an aimless science fiction writer, who gives Dwayne a volume simply to shut him up. Neither villain is believable, per se, but both were written to be personifications of ideals; vehicles of metaphor.\n\nI think Rand could've quite easily become Vonnegut, were she to stick around much longer, but perhaps I believe so only because I've experienced a quantifiable transition from her sort of thinking (vaguely) to his (perhaps less vaguely.) An incorruptible commitment to *absolute* was Ayn's most potent conviction. Growing up as a white cis male, I was aching for a method of simplifying the world which I knew more and more to be infinitely complex. Inevitably, with age, I think a limitless appetite for the complexity must form, lest one spend the rest of his\/her life fighting the singular truth in a miserable fortress of seclusion and amphetamine abuse. \n\nThe key to *Breakfast of Champions*' genius is its utter lack of angst. Aside from his brief definition of a being - \"an unwavering band of light\" - Kurt had little interest in writing a manifesto, yet his perspective in his curious commentary manifests a much more profound critique of American society than Rand ever could've from her hole. \n\nAs such, I think it's wisest to leave a rudimentary whole measurement of a writer to Aunt Ayn, but perhaps a particularly relevant spectrum in this case is clarity of sight. Rigid idealism has its place in literature, no doubt, but it's an awfully boring one without a writer's feet on the ground.\n\nHow does this all relate to self-publication? Well, Our Friend, it turns out, offers preset novel \"templates\" to members of his writing community, into which one can \"plug in\" characters, setting, and basic plot elements to a degree of his\/her choosing. And his YouTube channel is stuffed with all sorts of tutorials on formatting and - more disturbingly - how to create sellable cover art with Photoshop. Naturally, it includes instruction on stock and rights-free images.\n\nThough I've yet to read one, it doesn't take much imagination to comprehend the inevitable product. From Our Friend's vlogs, I can suppose a heavy focus on the adolescent market. What makes the whole concept noteworthy in my mind is the *why?* I'd like to think that I have a fairly-realistic grasp on the potentialities of writing for profit, and am obligated to wonder why one would \"compromise\" his\/her \"creative integrity\" by publishing *literature* to sell, of all things. \n\nAs I understand it, the methodical approach to authorship being encouraged is applicable to literally *any* other field, creative or not. It's curious and impressive, frankly, as their sales potential seems to be vastly superior to anything I'll ever bother to publish, but I must weigh in because of one quantifiable detriment: saturation. \n\nSomeone is spending their money on these works - probably for their kids. I'm not a parent, but I'd be tremendously ashamed to discover that a book I'd given as a gift to *anyone* had been manufactured in this manner. Not just in the sense that most light literature is *manufactured* - written in hearty observance of academic rules of storytelling - but *literally* mass-produced with a goddamned intellectual stencil. \n\nWithout sounding like I'm complaining... My singular self-published poetry collection is probably of significantly less whole-value to the majority of readers, but I can't help but think the effort put into its hand-drawn cover art and meticulously-arranged typography would make it a more *comfortable* investment, if anything else. \n\nThis brings us to a distinctly-academic mainstay which I have always taken issue with: \"consider your audience.\" I first encountered this proverb in the context of a composition studies course, mind you, where its consideration in the essay medium makes unequivocally good sense. If we agree that an essay is defined by an uncompromising commitment to its effectiveness in making an argument, audience awareness is essential. If you were asked to decide on one primary purpose of writing in general, though, would it not be identical?\n\nWhy didn't Kurt Vonnegut or Ayn Rand simply write essays? Well, the latter wrote many, but their sales have always been all but invisible compared to *The Fountainhead* and *Atlas Shrugged.* (Both of which resemble essays more than fiction, at times, but I'll spare you that conversation.) Did they consider their audience? Certainly not in the way [my first Google result](http:\/\/writingcommons.org\/open-text\/writing-processes\/think-rhetorically\/712-consider-your-audience) articulates it:\n\n> Ensure that your documents meet the needs and expectations of your readers.\"\n\nOoo boy. To me, that translates a little too easily into \"write what your readers want to read.\" And maaaan... If there's anything that experience and Donald Draper have taught me, it's that people have no idea what they want, especially from art. And that's a reasonable mentality, isn't it? Perhaps even an exhaltable one. I know that predictable stories are my number one turnoff, personally. If I expected to exist for an eternity, I'd absolutely indulge every single creative work I could find, but I do not, and that realization (as I stated in my last *Freq Check*,) has propelled an underlying preference in all of my consumption decisions: what I have not (before) seen.\n\nObviously, then - if you take my word for it - Our Friend's endeavors are in direct ideological opposition to my own, which would make him my arch nemesis, if 21st-century industry were a bit more theatrical. But - like most heroic protagonists - I'd be much more interested in \"turning\" him than censoring him, were we ever to engage. In fact, I'd probably end up defending his and\/or his constituents' right to sell their trash if CreateSpace or other self-publishing services called it into question.\n\nOverwhelming content volume can be entertaining; Drywall was my own foray into that uniquely contemporary experiment. It's the sheer ease of publication, though, that makes \"good\" literature more precious than ever. Admittedly, a glance at Amazon's current top ten bestsellers list indicates that I am undoubtedly out of touch as far as the market is concerned. I know that my mother and sisters have mysteriously reverted back to print from the Kindles which they used for a few years, and that audiobooks make me supremely uncomfortable. I also know that reading a book - whenever I bring myself to shut out everything else - is an unrivaled vehicle of cognitive serenity.\n\nA significant mission for *Extratone* lies in an upcoming reactionary movement to culture's \"circus stage\" (by way of the Internet.) We determined the event's inevitability on *Drycast*, a year ago, and have made occasional efforts to posit more thoroughly on *The New*. It must involve a reduction in content consumption, fundamentally, which will constrict because of an increasing demand for more explicit purpose in all media. We are not to be the alternative, necessarily, but the intermediary arbiter of the enabling discussion, hopefully with the outcome of increased awareness. What is and is not relevant? *Why am I consuming this?*\n\nAs the end of *Breakfast of Champions* draws abruptly closer, Vonnegut mentions his schizophrenia, which is - as you probably know - fundamentally characterized by loss of the ability to determine what is and is not real, and primarily treated with antipsychotics. Interestingly enough, extremely high doses of amphetamines (which Ayn Rand *did* use heavily, by the way. I wasn't making that up) can actually *induce* psychosis, which could crudely be described as *cognitive noise*. I could've missed the intended function of their works, but for me, they illuminate a distinct relationship between the abstracts of *truth* and *relevance* which, for the moment, seems particularly necessary. \n\nTwo opposing reflections of Americana; both helpful in preparation for its future.\n\nMay we never lose ourselves in the noise.\n\n#media","views":1129,"updated":"2021-12-06T07:49:43Z","tags":["media"],"type":null,"title":"Kilgore Trout on CreateSpace","slug":"breakfast-of-champions","appearance":"norm","language":"en","rtl":false,"created":"2016-09-07T15:00:00Z","collection":{"public":false,"alias":"bilge","total_posts":0,"title":"The Psalms","verification_link":"","description":"A <a href=\"https:\/\/davidblue.wtf\/db.vcf\">narcoleptic yokel<\/a> on software and culture.","style_sheet":"","views":177027,"monetization_pointer":""},"paid":false},{"id":"qp6nn0190hecnlna","body":"## Big Boy; Big Phone still in effect, words on next Tuesday's update from a withering old man.\n\n<!--more-->\n\n<audio controls>\n  <source src=\"https:\/\/github.com\/extratone\/bilge\/raw\/main\/audio\/TTS\/iOS10.m4a\">\n<\/audio>\n\nThanks to this week's September 2016 Keynote, we now know that iOS 10 will be officially released in just three days. I suppose it was a bit silly of me to download the [public beta](http:\/\/www.imore.com\/how-to-download-ios-10-public-beta) so late in the game, but I did, and regret it *much* less than I could've imagined.\n\nI've used my rose gold iPhone 6S Plus more than any personal device I've ever owned. For the first time in my functioning life, I've had no persistent need for a laptop, which is a pretty big deal for reasons you couldn't care less about.\n\nOwnership of my first generation iPhone trained me to dread new releases. Expectedly, it got less and less usable every time Stevie took the stage. For relevance's sake, I decided to opt in a bit early, despite my assumption that my 6S Plus would show its first signs of struggle as a result.\n\nImmediately, though, the opposite effect was noticeable. Everything is faster: notifications, app opening\/closing, intra-app function, and *text entry,* even. Smoother, too - so much so, it's almost a shame we've had to use iOS 9 on these devices for a whole year. The effect of such smoothing on my perception should be kept in consideration when reading the rest of my opining.\n\n**Raise to wake** is less tedious\/more useful than I anticipated, though it's been briefly mistriggered a few times in transit from inside my Moshi Overture Wallet Case (an extraordinary product, by the way,) but it should be noted that I walk and carry my phone rather strangely. With relatively default sleep\/wake settings, I did not notice enough mistriggering to have quantifiable power consequences.\n\n**Messages** is appropriately-complex for the times, now, if that makes sense. The pressure to \"compete\" with Snapchat, Facebook Messenger, What'sApp, etc. is understandable, but the execution of their reply is not. For me, at least, there is simply nothing to add to SMS. Its role is purely functional. I wasn't able to try out many of the new features. Not just because nobody else had iOS 10, but because - critically - I could not think of someone I'd be willing to bother with useless garbage like... a doodle. And even if I could've, it's probably actually *less* trouble to use one of those third-party applications in that Application Shop Apple has been so proud of for so long. For old people like me, even cleverly stowed buttons for unused features are *still buttons*. It feels an awful lot like an obligatory alteration, not a visionary one, and it's a shame that Apple's losing its awareness of the appropriate time for one, the other, or neither. \n\nI feel like competence in coverage of Apple is heavily dependent upon the ability to differentiate between the allure of an intelligently blingy feature and the allure of an intelligently functional one. Crude, I know, but ever more essential. **Contextual predictions** are impressive and surprisingly-clever. It's encouraging to see progress in such simple interactions, but - be honest with yourself - making use of it is actually going to cost you time in the majority of cases. Hate to be excessively meta here, but keep in mind - again - that I am not the majority. I tend to type things out... It's my thing. If this is completely obscuring my vision of any of these features' uselessness, *please* take the time to add to the discussion in the comments. Discourse is the handiest security in such matters. \n\nI've loved 3D Touch all along, even though something like 75% of the time, I've been triggering it unintentionally. It's *very* useful for quickly grabbing web images, but I'm probably more of a thief than you'll ever be. Mostly, I just like the sensation. The curt vibration and brittle illusion of a third interactive dimension have provided more functionality than... its actual functionality. With **touch and go**, though, I can instantly conjure a concise summary of the current local weather conditions, *and* a singular story from Apple News. Though I'm undoubtedly going to need to make a conscious effort to remember to use them, anything's a plus when one's affection was already so irrational.\n\nAs to **Apple News** itself... It's just not the same application. The \"For You\" roll was amusingly messy before but actual structure (read: functional aggregation) has killed some of its beauty, I'm afraid. It is *so* much faster, though. We'll actually have to take it seriously, now.\n\nI haven't gotten the opportunity to really use **rich notifications** yet, but I can't imagine them *actually* making anything much faster. Perhaps singularly, I've always found my unconscious navigation to a given application itself to be quick enough to consistently glance over \"no, you don't have to leave the app\" features.\n\nI suspect the ability to **search photos by content** will be iOS 10's most useful addition for myself. A few trials demonstrate that it can differentiate between \"nightfall\" and \"night,\" and \"clothed\" and \"nude.\" (I have never been naked.) It's the most intriguing, too, because it means more nuanced & controversial search parameters are just a few years away. Search by expression? Even search by *emotion.* I can't wait until Apple gets to wrestle with the perceived difference between peace and apathy within an algorithmic context.\n\n\"Please define 'joy,' Mr. Ives.\"\n\n#software","views":890,"updated":"2022-03-09T08:50:53Z","tags":["software"],"type":null,"title":"iOS 10's Speed Is Justification Enough","slug":"ios-10-review-speed","appearance":"norm","language":"en","rtl":false,"created":"2016-09-10T18:00:00Z","collection":{"public":false,"alias":"bilge","total_posts":0,"title":"The Psalms","verification_link":"","description":"A <a href=\"https:\/\/davidblue.wtf\/db.vcf\">narcoleptic yokel<\/a> on software and culture.","style_sheet":"","views":177027,"monetization_pointer":""},"paid":false},{"id":"1oahcrpd2veicjxp","body":"![How Mono Playback Looks](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/gbCNtnF.jpeg)\n\n## As dual speakers become the norm in smartphone design, let us briefly examine and explain why one should always expect to hear their music in stereo.\n\n<!--more-->\n\n<audio controls>\n  <source src=\"https:\/\/github.com\/extratone\/bilge\/raw\/main\/audio\/Mono.mp3\">\n<\/audio>\n\nThough I have many audiophilical sentiments and preferences, I cannot — by conscience — fully claim the title because I’ve never been able to justify the allotment of funds necessary for the obligatory equipment. (And my digital compressor usage in the production of [*Drycast*](http:\/\/extratone.com\/drycast) and [*Futureland*](http:\/\/extratone.com\/futureland) has been manifestly vulgar.) That said, audio engineering is one of the few topics which I can actually speak on with almost-academic authority, and my pretentiousness-capacitated preoccupation with quality-of-life compels me to bring up a ludicrously-rational standard that most of us have continued to undershoot for far too long.\n\nTwo weeks ago, the abundantly-rumored omission of the 3.5mm audio port in the iPhone 7 was finally settled. We played our own part in feeding the “controversy,” yeah, but I believe Apple was actually quite tardy in labeling smartphone-bound analog audio as archaic, though I’m not going to waste words in that discussion — it is definitely oversaturated, at this point — because I think mono audio is an even more prevalent topic.\n\nHonestly, out of all the missing features we’ve lamented over in the past decade, stereo speakers should’ve been the most aggravating. The gigantic difference, of course, is that the industry (and — by muddled extension — the consumers) has been all but silent in that regard. I write you, now, because we should all be colossally disappointed with ourselves.\n\nTwo channels. Left and right. Read: [Mono vs. Stereo](http:\/\/www.diffen.com\/difference\/Mono_vs_Stereo) But why should you care? What if Google — somehow — failed to provide you with a significant difference?\n\nOne channel of sound is — in terms of locale — rigidly static in your perception. Doubling the data creates a spectrum, adding **dimensionality**, which is infinite, ya know. Playing back audio in stereo, through two or more diaphragms (the fundamental hardware unit of sound reproduction,) now enables the exhibition of **audio pictures**.\n\nIf this is entirely new to you, I want you to do something. Find yourself a pair of headphones or a set of two or more computer speakers. (If these aren’t available, consider your car’s sound system. If it’s at all current and healthy, it’s gonna do the trick.) Bother to discover “**L**” and “**R**.” That is, left and right. Orient accordingly. Download [this 37-second clip](http:\/\/www.extratone.com\/media\/bikefest2016preview.wav) I recorded at [BikeFest](http:\/\/www.extratone.com\/audio\/bikefest\/) with my Zoom H2n. (Be advised: the preview is formatted in 5.1 surround, so it’s a very large file for its playback length.) Listen, obviously, and then listen again on your singular smartphone “loudspeaker.”\n\n**That’s what I’m talking about.**\n\nWhy am I being so abashedly patronizing? Why am I transgressing against our particular assumptions about you — the informed, savvy millennial audience? Because the vast majority of playback I hear in day-to-day life is still from a singular diaphragm; a singular source.\n\nA topical example: *I am shown a YouTube video on an iPhone*. (A pre-iPhone 7 device, that is.)\n\n*Walking downtown, I pass a small band of adolescent skateboarders listening to Cannibal Ox on a Samsung Galaxy Note.*\n\nWorst of all: *I find myself watching a Netflix film on my iPhone, in bed, not having bothered to wear the $200 pair of QC15s sitting within arm’s length.*\n\nInformed or not, **consumers are neglecting audio**, and dimensionality, alone is worth a change. Recent years have allowed the unlimited bandwidth assumption to become habit, so even the vast majority of today’s spoken word programs (like podcasts) — which, in general, stay in the “center” of their mix, making little to no use of the left-right spectrum — are produced in stereo, now. In many cases (including a few of ours,) this doublesizing is often for the sake of introductory themes, alone. If you care to imagine a more data-frugal society, the “waste” is ridiculous. It is not unrealistic to expect such a reality in the near future, but the same holds true for the reverse.\n\nIn the present’s abundance, though, the result is simply a decrease — as a whole — in playback’s “full experience,” if the hardware is not changed. Imagine how great it’d be if a digital audio formatting standard could be developed that’d enable a singular file to be mono or stereo, if needed\/utilized, to trim off redundancy, sorta like variable bit rate. Get on that, would ya?\n\nSo, why haven’t we become more diligent about our sound experiences? 1 billion iPhones in circulation, all with mono playback by default, are suspect culprits, I think. Of course, there are other devices, but none as influential — even the iPod, funny enough — on fundamental digital functions like music playback. And honestly, when is it appropriate or suave to take the extra steps?\n\n> *I want to show you this song. Let me untangle my headphones… Yes, okay. Put them in. I’m going to sit here in silence for four minutes, looking into your eyes as you listen to the entirety of this track.*\n\nIt’s never going to be socially acceptable. But what about wireless alternatives? Apple’s new Air Pods look absurd, but their by-computing optimization of the Bluetooth audio standard is revolutionary, in a small way, in [propelling](https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/technology\/2016\/sep\/25\/hearables-iphone-7-airpods-bragi-the-dash-revolution) the “hearables” paradigm into the mainstream, if only for a moment. If — in a strangely-audiocentric future — we are *always* wearing multipurpose sound reproduction devices in our ears, perhaps the waste of the Mono Monstrosity will be finally resolved. Until then, I suppose all we can do is give it an extra thought, for our own quality-of-life’s sake.\n\n<!--comment-->\n\n#hardware","views":997,"updated":"2024-01-06T00:06:24Z","tags":["hardware"],"type":null,"title":"Stop Settling for Mono Playback","slug":"mono-audio-playback","appearance":"norm","language":"en","rtl":false,"created":"2016-09-22T21:00:00Z","images":["https:\/\/i.snap.as\/gbCNtnF.jpeg"],"collection":{"public":false,"alias":"bilge","total_posts":0,"title":"The Psalms","verification_link":"","description":"A <a href=\"https:\/\/davidblue.wtf\/db.vcf\">narcoleptic yokel<\/a> on software and culture.","style_sheet":"","views":177027,"monetization_pointer":""},"paid":false},{"id":"b41m95cx6movmo8d","body":"![JFK](https:\/\/cdn-images-1.medium.com\/max\/1200\/1*evppGNkWVIeihlVfbVhK6Q.jpeg)\n\n## A man with a 6th-grade knowledge of moderate politics would plea for your reflection on what it really means to be your Commander-in-Chief.\n\n<!--more-->\n\nI hope you’ve read something about “The Great Debate” this morning.\n\nYou know — the [**first televised U.S. Presidential debate**](https:\/\/youtu.be\/4z-i0i-rJxU) between John F. Kennedy and Richard Nixon, 56 years ago today. The one “decided by makeup.”\n\nIf you don’t know the story, please Use Your Googler; I am the *last* source you should be receiving your first commentary from.\n\nThat so disclaimed, let us reflect on the fascinating — if somewhat universally disturbing — position in which we find ourselves. (Or, should I say — …you find *yourselves.)*\n\nTwo options: a ruthless, ridiculously-overqualified and progressively — appropriate flagship of a Democratic Party candidate, opposite an out-of-control, offensive joke of a destructive force that has been directed inward, toward his own Republican Party.\n\nThe only plausible hesitation for the former’s candidacy being a fundamental misunderstanding of the office’s necessities, and of the dangers of the “honesty” popularly idealized in the latter.\n\nAt least they are opposites, so I’m interested enough to write you.\n\n“The Great Debate” was an ultimate test — not of television — but of the American intellect, and it failed. From the outset of democracy’s greatest leap in perceptive democratization, superficiality claimed victory over policy.\n\nToday, we are to extrapolate in the journey we’ve taken in the 56 years hence, into — by any standard of measure — another world, entirely. Most importantly, into one with such gigantically-swelling intellectual disparity that it cannot possibly be monitored accurately, even moment-to-moment. The continued feasibility of Donald J. Trump’s candidacy is alarmingly conducive to the fact.\n\n> Note: Donald Trump will not be President of the United States as it has been understood. If he is elected by process, he will be promptly impeached, or the **function of the office itself** will be reexamined.\n\nMy bias is here: I genuinely believe sociopathic traits make for effective leaders, and am unable to respect anyone without control over their public persona. Trump’s defining acceptance of his undisciplined whirling relegates him — for POTUS, especially — to nothing more than an amusement. He is incapable of the duties that define the position as I know it. (e.g. a [commemorative visit to Hiroshima](https:\/\/youtu.be\/NDYiEHPfXRo?t=2m57s), or [participation in the G20 summit](https:\/\/youtu.be\/p8ChMVPV4R4).)\n\nIn such spirit, I — perhaps one of the least-qualified political commentators with any sort of voice — have a question to ask of you: **are you ready for the first ironic President of the United States of America?**\n\nPerhaps you’d counter, though, with something like: **are \\*you\\* ready for the first \\*authentic\\* President of the United States of America?**\n\nNo, America, I am not. And — forgive my patronization — neither are you. I know you feel *profoundly* devoid of an **expressive** leader. You, the most hardworking pillars of this society — I know you’ve craved a voice in the game for a very long time, but Mr. Trump’s is no nearer to your own than Mrs. Clinton’s.

The beginning of a new era, finally witnessed.\n\n<!--more-->\n\n*I managed to be reckless, tedious, and zealous in the usually-dry process of purchasing a new laptop, and found the story worth sharing. Expect a full review of the HP Spectre in the coming weeks.*\n\nThe meteorological complaints you’ve been hearing from mid-Missouri since Friday aren’t inappropriate this time – the middlefolk faced one of their most fatal enemies – a well-laid minefield of black ice. It slowed our timid, ABS-oblivious society to ten percent or less of its already near-postmortem pace.\n\n*For God’s sake, at least learn [why you needn’t pump your brakes ](http:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20161224044948\/http:\/\/auto.howstuffworks.com\/auto-parts\/brakes\/brake-types\/anti-lock-brake.htm)before you opt for infotainment extras or… get your driver’s license.*\n\nI woke up with the same debt and imminent expenses as I did the day before and without any more intention of buying a premium laptop than I’ve had for the two years I’ve gone [without one](http:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20161224044948\/http:\/\/www.extratone.com\/tech\/ios10\/).\n\nWithout the concept of mobile computing in its entirety, actually. I knew I’d lost my desire to carry a loose bluetooth keyboard around everywhere in case some insight were to fall upon me heavy enough to justify reaching for it over my 6S Plus in a public venue, hunched and squinting. There’s still nothing better at cranking out copy than the Lap Top Computer, I suppose. I was holding out for a truly-substantial alternative to Windows 10 and macOS, wanting to be enchanted by lite delights like Acer’s cheeky Chromebook R11, but had decided in self-pity that I’d probably never be able to stand a new operating system ever again.\n\nMy mom graciously decided to take me mall shopping for Christmas, which is comforting in its tradition of vapid routine. The state of a given midwestern metropolis’s mall is a keen indicator of the culture’s soul, I’ve found, and ours is mostly crewed by destitute alcoholics, who are my closest kin, and therefore my most appropriate company for *the holidays*.\n\n**Dillard’s is the second-best place to lose your mind in America.**\n\nEven now, when the somber corners are not quite so desolate. The acoustic sensation cannot be experienced anywhere else – the battlecries of the Me Generation’s pop reproduced by hateful diaphragms behind their white plastic ceiling facades and absorbed again by palletloads of mass-manufactured stonewashed denim, seemingly coming from a far-off wholesale nether no matter where in the store you’ve been buried. Ours is a few decades old, now – weathered and alone, which accentuates the whole dystopia with a resolute air of infinity, as if it’s certain it will outlast me. It probably will.\n\n![HP Spectre x360](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/ggT8UR5.jpg)\n\nI was deep within it all when I came across Dan Seifert’s [praising review](http:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20161224044948\/http:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2016\/12\/12\/13914962\/hp-spectre-x360-review-2016-laptop) of the HP Spectre x360. As I’ve constantly confessed, *The Verge*‘s lot are the only institution of their kind I’ve come close to trusting *too much*, so it was no small thing to see something so certain as “the premium laptop to buy this year” in his subhead.\n\nThe last time I was in the market for a laptop, there was little room for aesthetics in the equation. We have been taught this past decade that beautiful devices come in fruit form, only. Somehow, I allowed myself to integrate the ridiculous sentiment that MacBooks were the only option for anyone with any reverence for tactile experience. As I expect you’re aware of to at least some degree by now, Apple’s diligent study of desirability over the years is the singular force behind their lordship, and it’s the token MO of tech opinion to confuse it with sex appeal, resulting in expressions like “[apple hardware device] is sexy,” which is a pityingly desperate delusion. Do you actually find brushed aluminum appealing in any bodily sense?\n\nWe did once, of course. Your infatuation with the stuff probably peaked the moment you first grazed it, and – if you’re anything like me – you could be harboring more aesthetic frustration with their longstanding occupation than you think. Infatuation must be starved to survive, and we’ve been eating up Apples by the bushel for a decade.\n\nHaha.\n\nBut really, though – by the *billion*.\n\nI saw images in that Spectre review which I was completely satisfied with. I watched that new HP logo as it traveled through the frames, stupefied. Out of precious ignorance, I experienced real desire in that undesirable place. (Which could actually represent some sort of defeat on my part, but I’m not too bothered.)\n\n![HP Spectre x360](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/wcEdRy2.jpg)\n\nAnd in the midst of those desolate people in their fortress of mediocrity, my mom and I hatched a plan to indulge upon the best part of desolation – impulsive, subsidized gluttony. We’d stop by the pharmacy to fill my anti-depressant script before renavigating Bourgeois Bumper Cars to get to Best Buy, where she’d let me use her credit line to purchase my final choice in the segment.\n\n**Best Buy is the best place to lose your mind in America.**\n\nI could’ve sworn it made good sense to me, once – in Middle School, when my friend and I were spending most of our free time emulating the first generation of tech-reviewing YouTubers – but now, it reminds me of a darkwood restaurant with its closing fluorescents on, shining in the inverse frequency of a bug zapper – casting a more effectively-repelling ambiance for the human psyche than anything else *I’m* capable of dreaming up, at least.\n\nI used to fucking *visit* that store for no purpose but to see and experience the diluted bit of the handset renaissance with enough momentum to coast its way here. I probably spent a full sixty minutes wandering around by my own volition on a handful of occasions.\n\nBut these days, I am perturbed from the onset in a big way. There are too many blue vape enthusiasts on the sales floor at any given time, and they all want me to leave. They loaf around the carcass of consumer technology’s passion, not realizing, I guess, that I already know it ’twas they who killed it. (The stench is strongest by the wearables.) It’s eerie how little the Big Box itself has changed, considering the decade their goods have traveled.\n\nUnder a fittingly-gray sky, I wash my pill down with La Croix and a Kind bar to preempt the appropriate rumination in my mouth as we inch toward my Final Financial Doom with the spooked sliders. Though we never exceed 5mph, there are abandoned vehicles littering the shoulders and medians in varyingly absurd orientations. But I do not jest – today, I am silent, for I am one of them.\n\nBy the time we reach the store, my medicine has once again placed my soul in Safe Mode, so we shuffle into the grotesque thing. There are four employees in sight – no one else – and they all send their beady eyes my way. I have too much purpose in my consumerist jowls to pause, though, so I rush to the laptops near the opposite wall in an attempt to get an early estimate on my current level of personal computing idiocy. Naturally, my Mom snags one of another four associates immediately. In this work, I shall refer to him as Zoroaster.\n\n![HP Spectre x360](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/pCbk7GB.jpg)\n\nDespite having never seen 80% of the displayed devices in person before, I am able to spot the Spectres quickly, which is a good sign. I am immediately elated by the contrast to the depressing mushbooks I remember HP making in the oughts. The bezel… the brilliance of the display… the details of the visible body. I open *Extratone*. I open *The Verge*. I am hoping that Windows 10 will not be as much of a kicker as I’ve expected.\n\nI’m not a minute before Mom and Zoroaster have found the new MacBook Pros. Nobody remembers the password to the 13-inch, but the 15 is showing off its “deep blacks” and “Space Gray” mood. The Verge looks phenomenal, and its icon in the touchbar catches my eye. I manage to use it to switch tabs, the less-attuned degenerate in me noting the extra spanning required over CMD-TAB.\n\n“Have you tried the new keyboard?” asks Zoroaster.\n\nI hadn’t. It’s as indescribable as you’ve heard, but suggests legitimacy is Apple’s effort to bridge the transition from physical keyboards to their touch replacement. Terrifying legitimacy.\n\n“You get used to it,” he says.\n\nI open Pages and click out something ridiculous. Yeah… *click*. I’m sure there’s a better onomatopoeia available by way of just about any technology website, but I didn’t bother to study the sensation after realizing that it’s a con for my number one use of a Portable Computer – ***clacking***.\n\nIt’s not as if the thing isn’t gorgeous, though, in its way. After years of usership, I can tell you that it is undoubtedly a superb execution of the MacBook marque. It’s polished. It’s The New One. But it is also bleak and slateish. Some might even say *dystopian*. Do I want to carry such a thing around with me everywhere? Do I even want to carry it *out of the store?* What will I tell my friends? *What will I tell my staff?*\n\n$2,000 of my future spent on what is now a piece of *distinctly* establishment design…\n\nI return to the x360 to see what can be done about Windows’ appearance these days.\n\n*Purple-gray taskbars… Hm.* \n\n**It’s a sale.**\n\nLet me be honest with you – I spent some ninety minutes going between the two. Even if I’d endured the shame and self-disappointment of choosing the MacBook Pro, the simple grunt of the *challenge* the Spectre presents to it is no small milestone.\n\nAs Zoroaster scrambles to remove my new machine from *The Hanging Jail*, I am drained from the decision, but aware that my perspective on the world has changed. I’ve been working on an editorial for the past few weeks that’s mostly alarmed howling about the industry’s utter lack of passion, as of late, but seeing the Windows-running department’s devices and their matured design – *finally* beautiful without obvious Apple influence – had truly revived some little flame of hope within me.\n\nLithe Zoroaster was confused by UPCs a bit, as is understandable, and began juggling three Spectre boxes atop the prison lift, screaming the numbers – one at a time from each device – to his bewildered disciple, below.\n\nThroughout the later half of the whole ordeal, I’d had company – some sort of blonde working man who’d also braved the frictionless waste to calm himself with debt. I’d been elated at the opportunity for companionship, at first, but he’d found himself unable to escape the store’s bespoke Apple Hole. I did my best to help him, but failed hoist his girth from the 15’s benchmark suction. I’d left him there, bound. May my dreams n’er be haunted by the fading portrait of his tortured, middle class face.\n\nAs the Best Boys did their dance, he somberly came to my side. The grimace he’d worn in the struggle had fallen away. I knew what was coming before he formed the defeated words: “go ahead and grab me the 500 while you’re up there.”\n\nAs one does when they stumble upon a stranger’s funeral, I bowed my head.\n\nHere begins the part that sorta makes me look like an idiot.\n\nAfter signing my mother’s lengthy loan agreement, Zoroaster – the little devil – asked if I wanted the *Special Edition*, just behind me. I’d stopped by last year’s Big Boy Spectre – the ballsy-ass copper-toned masterpiece – and had wished for a moment that the look could’ve carried to the fresher x360.\n\nThe monospace Hewlett-Packard logo blinded me, and the unlit display (it hadn’t been set up yet) concealed the wider bezel of… The older Spectre 13t – with which I write, now.\n\nI didn’t notice my blunder until after our treacherous return, and could not care less.\n\n#hardware","views":683,"updated":"2022-03-09T08:51:20Z","tags":["hardware"],"type":null,"title":"O'er the Ice for Stupified Usury","slug":"hp-spectre-x360-review","appearance":"norm","language":"en","rtl":false,"created":"2016-12-19T18:00:00Z","images":["https:\/\/i.snap.as\/DlQZXor.jpg","https:\/\/i.snap.as\/ggT8UR5.jpg","https:\/\/i.snap.as\/wcEdRy2.jpg","https:\/\/i.snap.as\/pCbk7GB.jpg"],"collection":{"public":false,"alias":"bilge","total_posts":0,"title":"The Psalms","verification_link":"","description":"A <a href=\"https:\/\/davidblue.wtf\/db.vcf\">narcoleptic yokel<\/a> on software and culture.","style_sheet":"","views":177027,"monetization_pointer":""},"paid":false},{"id":"jjjjsos6aa122t3e","body":"![Oak Cliff Sky ](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/wXG1ZnE.jpeg)\nand in those open spaces,\nyou would fly your flag of adoration, frustration, miscommunication, and mutilation\n\nslicing proud,\nthere -\nlashed to the stern of the vessel *Hateful*;\n\nher keel lain by callouses of home -\nhands & feet stiff\n(long ago,\nthey hauled barley, by bushel\ndown a gravel road)\n\nbut an instant of that rarified quiet stays the haze's obfuscation,\nfaltered:\nour sisters lie lynched on dire alters\n\nour homesteads,\ncrypts; shrines to delirium\nthe chords of our songs left unresolved\nin imposters' inrequiem\n\nplastic for stone;\nfiberglass for coal\nstale rot for flesh,\ncut with nothing\nto our bones\n\nmirages in the mirror,\ndarkly:\ndevil's imps roost on red Remingtons,\nlimp\n\nplugged,\nour ears in mute\n\nterror's gluttony,\nstripped down furrows of\nfalsity's fatherly fugue\n**truth: our souls seethe in the dark**\nwe are drowning in our own deceptions\n\nin excess,\nwe are barren\nwe parade nothing but the lies\nwhich proceed the whole of Earthly pain\n\nbreathless,\nwe are foolish monstrosities -\nthe incongruent Lords of amplified insanity\n\nresolute,\nwe are the hearthen hole into which all eventually fall,\nfamished for youth\n\nmanic,\nwe are the monopolized manufacturers of mantra;\nan ambient, discordant dirge\n\npatriotic,\nwe produce only pervading paternal plague\n\nnostalgic,\nwe are the fundamental erosion of human wellness\n\nabrasive,\nwe are needlessly suffering -\nthe listless harlequin of a nation\n\n~**the world is growing weary of our emergency**~\nand the humongous expenditure of its petty insincerities\n\n#poetry","views":534,"updated":"2019-07-28T17:40:15Z","tags":["poetry"],"type":null,"title":"Ablaze, the Fraternal Fallow","slug":"ablaze-the-fraternal-fallow-david-blue","appearance":"norm","language":"en","rtl":false,"created":"2017-03-17T17:35:00Z","images":["https:\/\/i.snap.as\/wXG1ZnE.jpeg"],"collection":{"public":false,"alias":"bilge","total_posts":0,"title":"The Psalms","verification_link":"","description":"A <a href=\"https:\/\/davidblue.wtf\/db.vcf\">narcoleptic yokel<\/a> on software and culture.","style_sheet":"","views":177027,"monetization_pointer":""},"paid":false},{"id":"jne8wqzgv5qxknz2","body":"*The following was sent as part of [a personal TinyLetter](https:\/\/tinyletter.com\/DavidBlue) I've just begun in the hopes of rejuvenating my ability to tell stories.*\n\n<!--more-->\n\nThere are a few entities which continue to validate what I'm pursuing, but [Joshua Topolsky](https:\/\/twitter.com\/joshuatopolsky) and his [*The Outline*](https:\/\/theoutline.com\/) are particularly worth noting. In search of reassurance, I listened to a [podcast](https:\/\/digiday.com\/podcast\/outlines-josh-topolsky-theres-much-sameness-digital-media\/) he appeared on in February, last night, and also found [one](https:\/\/longform.org\/posts\/longform-podcast-27-joshua-topolsky) from 2013, when he was still EiC of *The Verge*. Basically the entirety of the first is within the idealism I've risked most of myself for, in case you're curious. I've looked up to Topolsky in a huge way, this past year. He has done – and is doing – many things which I am intrinsically drawn to earn for my legacy, and the presence of his wife on his staff (their few [podcasts](https:\/\/soundcloud.com\/tomorrowpodcast\/episode-28-laura-june-and-the-contrarian-disposition) together are adorable in a very particular way,) is idyllic in appearance, at least. I love the way they talk about each other. I suppose spousal editorial staff is probably the personal hell of a good many people. Perhaps, it's even my own. Listening to him talk on Digiday, though, reminded me – along with a few other works I've consumed lately – that *technically*, *Extratone* is a *business.* Or at least... That it must become one eventually or die forever. While trying to explain my future plans to a friend, I inadvertently layed out some 'steps for growth.'\n\n  1. **Form and activate the community.**\n  2. **Build a beautiful, one-of-a-kind method of content delivery.**\n  3. **Attain a fairly dependable content cadence.**\n  4. **Sell the product in a way that immediately and – from then on – consistently ensures and\/or furthers its quality.**\n\nI guess we're somewhere between 2 and 3 right now. I'm still building a body of written work more or less on my own, which is okay, considering that nobody is paid. I suppose it'd be most desirable – before I move to the Northwest – to figure out how to make *The Tone* as much of a learning experience for my closest staff as possible. And regardless of all other external goals of the magazine, I think it is more than safe to say that I've learned more in the past 10 months from a fucking WordPress website than I would've if I'd spent that time at the Journalism school. The first annual renewal payment for extratone dot com just went through, actually. A year ago, I was *much* more entertaining, but virtually directionless. I honestly can't tell if I feel any better internally, day-to-day, but I know I am at least attaining the capability of real friendship for the first time in my life, and I suppose that's more than worth losing virtually all of my engagement on Twitter.\n\nPerhaps its even worth losing a portion of the freshness in my perspective – the stuff I thought made it worth it in the first place. Especially if my staff maintains it healthily within their own.\n\nI'll admit that – in retrospect, after spending a year reading, writing, and digitally fussing – a lot of my original content smells like edgy nonsense. Some of the work within our network does too, honestly, but it's usually much less so.\n\nOf course, that transition required an excruciating crucible, for me, but that's exactly why I'm incessantly compelled to make as much use of my trauma as possible: so that my friends and staff may be able make progress toward more fulfilling lives without such a massive up-front cost.\n\nAs I was writing my [interview with mastodon's creator](https:\/\/bit.ly\/hellbird), I kept an eye out for related coverage, and eventually saw what *[PCMag*](<http:\/\/www.pcmag.com\/article\/352875\/what-is-mastodon-and-will-it-kill-twitter>) did, and it's unwanted rant-spuringly aggravating language.\n\nFor most of my adult life, I've been trying to figure out why publications like *PCMag* feel it necessary to belittle their audience *and* their subjects to such a degree. Silicon Alley can't possibly be *that* vapid as to nix all soul in any story, ever.\n\n![uh](http:\/\/gallery.tinyletterapp.com\/e8ecb4f78686444d5a5c89d53c49de7c8feb8ac5\/images\/f15ad2c3-dbd3-4697-9c37-b4d97f260dd8.png)\n*I mean… What in the hell is this, even?*\n\nI haven't been a reader since I used to loiter in Barnes & Noble with a pile of print editions in the oughts, but this sort of layout has got to be some kind of **digital sin.**\n\nI'm not going to bother digging through the publication to compare this work with others for the moment. Perhaps one day, I'll feel the need to polish this rant into an argument and make it more visible. Surely, though, the proximity of this abomination to the word *Mag* or even *Magazine* must keep *somebody* awake at night.\n\nThat's not to say it doesn't take some sort of discipline. I doubt I could write in this way without hulking hyper-deliberately over *wherever the fuck this dialect comes from.* I think it's almost certainly more efficient as an informative device than my piece, or [Sarah Jeong's](https:\/\/motherboard.vice.com\/en*us\/article\/mastodon-is-like-twitter-without-nazis-so-why-are-we-not-using-it), but the assumption that readers would be so disinterested as to hesitate to even commit to *complete sentences* regarding something *actually* newsworthy for a technology publication should be taken personally.\n\n*(This is going to echo what Topolsky said in both of those podcasts in big ways, but I'll try to keep it relatively brief.)*\n\n**I believe there is an audience that is craving attention to detail in their stories, a more intimate, longer-lasting, and more invested relationship with a much smaller number of publications.**\n\nEven a sense of involvement in the process. It's probably a direct result of my longtime consumption of car magazines – most of which still have sizable sections dedicated to direct, public correspondence with readers. It's also cross-platform to a surreal degree. Auto journalists of all tiers will straight up engage with you on Twitter. (*MotorTrend* literally prints YouTube comments.)\n\nSure, the readership is old, and the topic is an outlier (it's fairly common knowledge that 'car people' are waaaay more vulnerable to obsession than other special interest communities,) but the species is more or less the same, and the results are plain as day, any time you care to look. In recently returning my attention to technology journalism, I've noticed an irritating affront to meta conversation with strangers. My theory is that they've been paid for their words so long that they develop a very particular greed towards them, which is why academic journalism institutes are immediately shunned by their alumni after graduation until they are definitely Too Tired to sling copy and begin to climb sortof diagonally through editorial titles until they are stashed away in some hole. Then, after ruminating until their first encounter with Actual Death – if they're still interested in the whole thing – they crawl out to be propped up in front of moderately sized bodies of petrified students to scream in 100% bitterness about *The Ethics* that plagued them spiritually and financially their entire career at the acolytes as their last joke on the world.\n\nBut they won't engage with strangers on Twitter.\n\nAs someone who – for better or worse – chose to sidestep the academic route, I will never advocate for any value in withholding information – especially funny stories – about *Extratone*'s operation. If anything, *rediscovering relevance* is a wholly meta pillar of our editorial bent. (Hence, why Tim calls us *The Nieman Lab of Community College.*)\n\nI also believe the subscriber & advertising revenue models are *directly* \\- if not *primarily* \\- involved in the constriction of conversations regarding a publication's operation. It's my goal to cultivate a group of subscribers that are directly invested in the product (there's another new word on my part) financially, intellectually, and emotionally. It's not exactly unheard of, ya know.\n\n*Anywho*, I'm going to leave you in peace for now. I've really enjoyed this wanton spewing of conjecture, but then... who doesn't love to go on, unchecked?\n\nIs *this* what blogging is? It's fucking obnoxious.\n\nThank you for reading and *beware the fucking egg*. \n\n#media #meta","views":284,"updated":"2021-12-06T07:43:28Z","tags":["media","meta"],"type":null,"title":"On the Future of the Respected Audience","slug":"respected-audience-future","appearance":"norm","language":"en","rtl":false,"created":"2017-04-10T23:34:03Z","images":["http:\/\/gallery.tinyletterapp.com\/e8ecb4f78686444d5a5c89d53c49de7c8feb8ac5\/images\/f15ad2c3-dbd3-4697-9c37-b4d97f260dd8.png"],"collection":{"public":false,"alias":"bilge","total_posts":0,"title":"The Psalms","verification_link":"","description":"A <a href=\"https:\/\/davidblue.wtf\/db.vcf\">narcoleptic yokel<\/a> on software and culture.","style_sheet":"","views":177027,"monetization_pointer":""},"paid":false},{"id":"rt5hdgag8phuf9n6","body":"![Mastobird](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/creNKgg.png)\n\n## Eugen Rochko has spent this year perfecting federated social media in Mastodon – his open source project.

Less than two hours after we said our goodbyes, his name was on *The Verge*'s front page.\n\nDespite the urgency of it all, he graciously lent me his time just after breakfast on Tuesday to discuss himself and the story behind the project, while the most significant day of his life was building around him.\n\n\"I'm perfectly fine with being called *Eugene* by Americans.\"\n\nThough the ink's still fresh on his compsci diploma, he's clearly prepared for the American press.\n\nhttps:\/\/open.spotify.com\/episode\/6QKhv7jaZsAHJxBjyiyZf7?si=I_eqn5Q6Q2aXi04Nq10LJw\n\n------\n\n**What's the story behind the project? Do you remember the specific moment when you decided to do this?**\n\nMany years ago, I had a friend that was really into federated networks when they were a new thing. That was when [identi.ca](http:\/\/identi.ca\/) was first created - at the very beginning of my developer knowledge and career.\n\nA good portion of the stories written so far on his platform have framed it as an alternative to Twitter, which early Masto adopters refer to as \"Hellbird,\" or \"the bird website.\" Eugen isn't afraid to acknowledge his investment in the format.\n\nI was a heavy Twitter user and I wasn't happy with where Twitter was going, so I decided to check on how the federated stuff was doing in the meantime. I found it in a very sad state, but thought I could contribute.\n\nHe began building on his own, with Tweetdeck's standard in mind.\n\n> I thought 'if I'm going to do something, it needs to have realtime updates and it needs to have columns.' I started with a bare-bones prototype while still [at University] in May or April of last year. It had no user interface, only an API that I was using from the command line. And I thought 'okay, it works. that's great.' Then, exams came.\n\nAcademics had to come before the project at first, but it soon supplied an ample post-graduation diversion. He focused his energy on building something more complete and eventually launched a [Patreon page](https:\/\/www.patreon.com\/user?u=619786).\n\n> I [announced](https:\/\/news.ycombinator.com\/item?id=13303346) it on HackerNews, and that was the first public release of the project. That's when I got my first users who weren't my friends, and some who were new to federated networks.\n\nThat was just over 100 days ago, and it gave way to his first feedback.\n\n> I started working on the first feature requests, shaping the project a bit differently. People were a lot more focused on privacy features than I thought they would be, although in retrospect, it makes sense. The previous [federated] project - GNU social - did not really have a focus on privacy features, or anything built in by default.\n\nIt compelled him to change things, and his work was well received.\n\n> Over time, I kept working on new features, and waves of new users came when it went viral in certain circles. The first was HackerNews and Product Hunt. [Aral Balkan](https:\/\/twitter.com\/aral) - a Twitter user with over 30,000 followers - picked up the project, gave it a shout out, and even did a giveaway of his app. He had a lot of followers from Holland; the Mastodon timelines became mostly Dutch.\n\nNext was Marxist anime Twitter (including *[Extratone](http:\/\/mastodon.social\/@extratone)* and [I](http:\/\/bit.ly\/dbmastodon).)\n\nLots of furries; lots of LGBT people. That's when I really focused on privacy features and making sure all blocks worked because these individuals needed a safer platform than Twitter could offer.\n\n![Sidekick dashboard background processing jobs as of Tuesday morning.](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/0bAIHB6.png)\n\n*Sidekick dashboard background processing jobs as of Tuesday morning.*\n\n\"As you can see, the first bump is HackerNews, the second is Aral Balkan, and then anime\/Marxist Twitter.\"\n\nAnd the last - now a bit out of date - is this week's spike, which is nearly double all previous waves.\n\n**Are you responsible for all of the code?**\n\nYou can look at the [GitHub page](https:\/\/github.com\/tootsuite\/mastodon) to see a specific breakdown of who contributed and how many lines of code, each. You'll see I'm at the top by a large margin, but there are [additional] people who've contributed interesting, good features & fixes, localizations, user guides, and documentation.\n\n**What's the story behind the name?**\n\nIt's not particularly interesting. I'm a progressive metal fan, and I listen to *Mastodon* sometimes. They have a really cool name that refers to a really cool animal. It's a fluffy elephant! What's not to love?\n\nIt's also the inspiration for Mastodon's mascot, which was penned by Rochko's YouTuber friend [Dopatwo](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/user\/dopatwo) after he realized how urgently he required an error page.\n\n**What does \"federated\" mean to you?**\n\nThe biggest problem with this term is that it's new for lots of people. People who've come across federated networks in the past *instantly* understand what it means and how it works, and people who are new to the concept have a lot of trouble before it clicks. But when Twitter first started, people didn't understand what 'retweeting' meant, so it's not a unique problem domain.\n\nI don't know where it comes from - maybe BitTorrent - but people seem to think that when something is 'decentralized,' everybody gets the same thing; that it's all synchronized one to one. In actuality, 'federated' means that people in different instances can *talk* to each other, but the *content* is different depending on the users there, what they do, and who they follow.\n\nThough instances are infrastructurally independent, they can communicate with one another. On a user level, timelines are still determined by who you do and do not follow across the entirety of all instances. \n\n**What if Twitter comes to you in the near future with a job offer?**\n\n[Rochko laughs.]\n\nIf it was any other company, I would think about it. A job is a staple source of income, and - depending on the company - could involve doing something important, but I have zero faith in Twitter.\n\n**Does this all mean that I finally get to live out my serif Twitter dream?**\n\nYes, I suppose on your own instance, you could change the stylesheet...\n\n**So if I set up my own instance and started charging for its use, I'd be in the clear, legally?**\n\nYes, that's okay. The code is licensed under [AGPL](https:\/\/www.gnu.org\/licenses\/agpl-3.0.html) version three, which I picked because other projects in the same space are using it. The difference between AGPL and GPL is that [the former] forces you to contribute back to the appstream code repository if you make any breaking changes.\n\nFor example, Eugen explained that WhatsApp originally used XMPP for its chat protocol, which meant that Facebook and Google Talk users could connect to it, too. However, the company progressively locked down the platform over time, leaving virtually nothing visible that was unique to XMPP in its current iteration.\n\nTo prevent somebody taking Mastodon code, placing it behind locks, and stripping out the federation part to make Twitter II, I'm using this license.\n\nThe thing to remember about free software is that 'free' means *freedom of the user,* not that it's zero cost. It's perfectly fine to charge for free software because developers need to live, too.\n\n**I've seen a lot of multilingual 'tooting' these past few weeks. Can we expect an in-app translate function like Twitter's on Mastodon?**\n\nI don't think I could put in a 'translate this toot' button because APIs from Google and Bing are quite expensive at scale. I'm not 100% promising this, but I can probably put something in where people can select which language they post in, and then just filter the timelines. That would at least solve the problem of being confronted with lots of French posts, without knowing any French.\n\n**The only complaint about Twitter I remember that hasn't already been addressed here is the capability of editable 'toots.' Is that a possibility?**\n\nThat won't happen. There's actually a good reason why they don't do that. It's simply because you could make a toot about one thing, have people favorite it and share it, link it from other places, and then suddenly, it says 'Heil Hitler,' or something.\n\n![Mastotile](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/jrP0kLj.png)\n\nIt's a bit preposterous to continue the conversation as if Twitter and Mastodon are interchangeable entities. They exist in separate ideological and mechanical spheres, and will both continue to do so for a very long time.\n\nThat said, the fundamental user interface design and current cross-community user saturation *do* warrant comparisons between their functions. More likely than not, you'll create a Mastodon account because a link found you on Twitter, use it because you prefer its type of ecosystem, and you'll stay after realizing that nearly all of your age-old qualms have been addressed, if not already rectified. While *FOSS* and *Federated* may seem at times like jejune ideologies, their advantages are especially tangible in this context. Should you find yourself needing to complain about something, you'll find an audience. Perhaps it'll be your command line.\n\nIt's nothing but negligent to describe Mastodon as an *alternative* or *clone*. \n\nIt's more like Twitter's son.\n\nIt's leaner, quicker-to-change, much more flexible & democratized, and less corrupt. Though I didn't ask its creator what he intended to gain from all his effort, I think his commitment itself denotes a preoccupation with progress. Those of you who've been let down by the tools you've been given to control your words' exposure will find startling competence in your ability to determine per-toot privacy, or reserve your raucous photos and terrible memes from followers who are not necessarily complicit consumers. Naturally, it's also much less dependable, though a single instance outage will never leave you truly, completely silent. And the support will come.\n\nIt's been a privilege to be observer and participant in the first lightening of a new online community. In the moment, we enjoy our lavender haze -when the spaces are filling primarily with users who are sincerely interested enough in discourse to have sought it out.\n\nSarah Jeong's [account](https:\/\/motherboard.vice.com\/en_us\/article\/mastodon-is-like-twitter-without-nazis-so-why-are-we-not-using-it) of her Twitter exile is a good, long read if you're craving more specifics, and Eugen's [Medium](https:\/\/medium.com\/@Gargron) offers a more complete explanation of federation and its place in the industry, straight from the source.

Can fire be fought with fire?\n\n<!--more-->\n\n<iframe src=\"https:\/\/whyp.it\/tracks\/embed?id=126463&token=dT7Bl\" width=\"100%\" height=\"200\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\"><\/iframe>\n\nToday, after positing on whether or not a pastry was in fact the namesake of the battleship *Bismarck*, I was told by its owner - a local woman of a far-from-excusable age - that \"[I] should be on that big bang show.\" Upon such fuckery, I looked her in her eyes and informed her that she'd just changed my plans for the night: I was now going to go home, wrap my lips around the barrel of my Beretta, and blow my brains out. I should've known better than to so jest with a boomer immediately after receiving such glaring indicators of minimal intellectual function, but I fell for the hope - as I often do, to no avail - that such a jarring reaction would encourage reflection on her foul, tragically misled sentiments regarding the general state of youth, and perhaps even spare a peer or two from future tribulation.\n\nInstead, she called the police.\n\nThree round cops found me, an hour later, approaching hesitantly. Strangely enough, they were chuckling - maybe to a little joke about all the recent hubbub on the radio covering a recent wave of blatantly negligent medical care in American prisons, though I hope nervous laughter is just *SOP* when responding to a suicide threat. As all Columbia cops always are toward me, they were aggravatingly genuine and hilariously understanding. I began by simply recreating my interaction with their summoner, quoting her word-for-word, and - I swear to my new Lord - all three immediately released a choral \"ohhhhh\" in unison. I'll never know for sure if they actually assimilated the reality of the situation so quickly, but it'd certainly seem that way.\n\nClearly, I should've threatened *her* life.\n\nDespite the day-to-day expression of our recurring wisdoms, habits, instincts, patterns and cycles of cultural metamorphosis in the discourse, the stream of \"well, you know they were sayin' the world was going to end when *I* was in elementary school\" to my ear has fallen abruptly silent since the inauguration. Our parents and grandparents are both impossibly fortunate and unfortunate, having to duck out as the most multiplicative (read: sickest) cerebral orgy in the history of mankind will just've begun nibbling on the slope to its climax. We'll be lucky if we'll still be able to articulate our goodbyes by the time they reach the door. Nonsense does a fuckin number on perceived wisdom, but the gaps *are* widening at a dangerous pace. Tectonic or domestic, we are all straddling expanding space, and the chill of its draft is now stealing too much of our heat to ignore.\n\nThough it is entertaining in the moment (and otherwise redundant,) it would not be *well-to-do* of me now - nor was it, then - to leave the conversation in edgy absurdity. Yes, a part of me would like to campaign for *Sheldon* to be reclassified as an expletive, in disgust, but - as an adult in all-out sprint to make up for stalled emotional development - I must note that such a display of concern should've been at least reciprocated with a bit of explanation, if not appreciation. Still, there are much more appropriate reasons and situations in which to waste public servants' time.\n\nIt's not news - the *Theory* is providing *some* ghoulishly skewed portrayal of less-than-forty pseudointellectuals. Obviously, my savior's time was worth very little to her, but the fact that she spent any quantity of anything at all engaging with even a decidedly mainstream generationally ambassadorial bridge could be regarded - if stretched - as the result of a curious seed, which has skyrocketed in human value, as of late. It is undiscouragable. Read the trail a bit, and you'll find that your frustration is simply an expression of the terror that's ignited by the stagnancy of their pace.\n\n*It's great that you've managed to inch over to modern-ish sitcoms from Judge Judy and* Independence Day *, mom, but you're gonna have to* ***really pick up the pace*** *and work on following a few body modification communities on the darknet.*\n\nIf an absence of *solutions* are the crux of the *blog*, here I'm now gloating.\n\nTo whom does the commoner look to for such solutions when they'd prefer not to terrorize their kooky middle age parents into a half century of brutal fasting under vows of silence?\n\nThe Big Thinkers!\nThe Men of the Hour.\n\nYes, *men.* All Big Bumbling Billionaire Imbeciles.\n\nElon Musk *cannot* be the Nicola Tesla of the 21st century, or even the *20th*, for that matter, because literally *every* mechanically-minded professional I've ever heard talk about battery technology has condemned it in some manner as an inescapable dead end, developmentally. Perhaps, then, the champion of electrochemical storage is *the* False Prophet.\n\nNo, I'm not capable of citing research or conjuring Mars-capable spacecraft, but I've been a bit too preoccupied with my country's class war and its [10% adult illiteracy rate](http:\/\/bit.ly\/unescoliteracy). It's all well and good to be privy to romanticism, but it's not the 1960s anymore. Even Howard Hughes would be more concerned for the wellness of the species than our continued reach for the stars, were he still alive.\n\nWell. Maybe not...\n\nCharles Lindbergh would be, though.\n\nWe spent the 1990s preparing to rid ourselves of history because the smartest among us foresaw some facsimile of the renaissance we are currently experiencing. If they'd been shown a glimpse of [some statistics](http:\/\/bit.ly\/measuringconsumerinfo) on the volume of media we consume, they'd exclaim of their pride - no doubt - in their species' capability to progress, and perhaps even their own contribution to it. However, extended observation of an average American's day-to-day life would be lamented, in disgust, and a [huge portion](http:\/\/bit.ly\/millennialspew) of the blame can be placed on one t-shirt-touting cyberyokel: Mark Zuckerberg.\n\nHis name is stupid, his spawn is ruining my life, and he continues to insist upon saying shit that frightens the bejesus out of me.\n\n[Zuckbrain](https:\/\/backchannel.com\/we-are-entering-the-era-of-the-brain-machine-interface-75a3a1a37fd3) is fucking scary.\n\n\"[Wiring the globe](http:\/\/bit.ly\/zuckfuck)\" is fucking scary.\n\n[Jarvis](http:\/\/bit.ly\/zuckbot) is fucking scary.\n\nBut Fuck, himself wouldn't be at all intimidating without his money. The scariest bit is the lack of *class* in the criticisms of his intellectual influence. Farhad Manjoo's [attention](http:\/\/bit.ly\/fuckbug) has been diligent and premium as a *Times* er's should be, but the same occupation bars him from authoring with the color of unsubstantiated claims.\n\nMine does not.\n\nElon Musk is not an apologetic genius. He's willing to [joke](http:\/\/bit.ly\/aloofmusk) about his intellectual distance from the planet and its populace on Twitter. Apparently, his mind's even surpassed the need to punctuate. Crazy.\n\nGoogle is well on it's way to becoming the neo-Vatican... yada yada yada, but they're too far gone - I do not have the expertise to address them. Fuck, though, is a singular short-sleeved, *Even Stevens* -haired young man [without](http:\/\/bit.ly\/crowdfuck) so much as private office space (even though his sentiments on breathing room at home are [obviously inverse](http:\/\/bit.ly\/fuckflex).)\n\nClearly, it's all just to protect him from the truth: **The Apostle John's** ***Book of Revelation*** **is about Facebook**. Fuck's cyberchild is the horseman, the beasts, *and* the plagues, stuffed into one tyrannical website.\n\n> And the smoke of their torment ascendeth up for ever and ever: and they have no rest day nor night, who worship the beast and his image, and whosoever receiveth the mark of his name.\n\nIf I can *repeatedly* trigger accidental voice calls on Fuckbook Messenger, don't tell me it's not possible to inadvertently live stream myself on the pot.\n\n> The beast that thou sawest was, and is not; and shall ascend out of the bottomless pit, and go into perdition: and they that dwell on the earth shall wonder, whose names were not written in the book of life from the foundation of the world, when they behold the beast that was, and is not, and yet is.\n\nOf course, it's unlikely that Mark's essence was bred entirely of evil, but - like Tump, in many ways - he is an excruciatingly wealthy idiot. Though he *is* spending 2017 touring the United States, he [doesn't seem](http:\/\/bit.ly\/fucklearning) to be all that interested in *actually* closing the gap between himself and the rest of us, which suggests that he only wants us to throw us off his extra-terrestrial, xenophobic scent. I can't imagine what *The Mothership* would really want with my Amazon browsing history, though.\n\n> And another angel came out of the temple, crying with a loud voice to him that sat on the cloud, Thrust in thy sickle, and reap: for the time is come for thee to reap; for the harvest of the earth is ripe.\n\nJust to be clear, **he is not** ***The Antikhristos***.\n\nHe'd better not be, anyway.\nI'd be absolutely Livid with Lucifer if his choice of a figurehead for his Big Plan was such a Fucking dork.\n\nI mean... if Fuck wanted to spend his time crafting 6000-word essays, why the Fuck didn't he just build a Fucking CMS back in his Jesse Eisenberg era instead of *the actual* weekly-updated tower of digital Babylon? Surely, Satan would know better than to waste resources and pulverize creativity by ordering his Demonic Dev team to release regular builds for build's sake rather than on a per-need basis, but that'd be because The Tempter is an authority on *incentive* as thoroughly as Fuck isn't.\n\nIf you’re equipped with the privilege of literacy, you’ve been reading a lot about Fuckbook’s political consequences, recently. Frankly, *it’s about Fucking time*, but I’m compelled to emphasize that the most significant motor driving the politik is fueled by the eldest, fossilized portions of our thought meat. According to Manjoo, \"the News Feed team’s ultimate mission is to figure out what users want,\" dipping in Facebook's ocean of action data, searching for a soul.\n\nYet another Fuckism that suggests he's an alien: everybody knows that *nobody* knows what they want. \n\nThere's a central mechanic of our brains that by nature wreaks a whole helluva lot of contradiction. If you've ever mentioned ADHD with your doctor, or know a hypochondriac\/adderall fiend who has, you may have heard it described as \"the lizard brain.\" Simply put, it's the brain stem, and it's responsible for the most basal and primitively emotional instincts and habits; an anti-intellectual agitant, arguing at all times for the course of action with the most immediate gratification. *The Great Clickbait War* of 2013 was a startling demonstration that revealed the strength of the hold Fuckbook had (and still has) on these reptilian bits - the true location of its power.\n\n\"In surveys, people kept telling Facebook that they hated teasing headlines. But if that was true, why were they clicking on them?\"\n\n*Volition* is the Word of the Day. Here, we must once again invoke an ancient parable from the wise foretellings of the Disney film, *Smart House*: **when dealing with human beings, boundless compliance quickly leads to abject misery for all parties involved.**\n\nMindlessly, habitually, endlessly clicking... **this is how we die**.\n\nSomething about Fuck's direction is fundamentally poisonous to the human mind. Yes, he *is* assuredly too Fucking democratic, but misinformation is far from the only form of evil his creation has assumed. If you can jog your memory back a bit, you'll remember a much wider variety of brain-rotting filth.\n\nIn lapses of their existences' finitude, the 40-something second cousins of the world may still send you the occasional *Can Crunch Saga* invite, jarring you back to Jr. High in 2009, and forever associating themselves in your mind with the horrors of mortality and **f u c k b o o k  g a m e s.**\n\nElon is a more likely candidate, but I'll leave those differentiations to the not-idle cult masses.\n\nMore than one sixth of all living eyes [see](https:\/\/newsroom.fb.com\/company-info\/) Fuckbook every single day, placing its consumption behind only eating and drinking as the most universally human activity.\n\nMr. Fuck achieved his vision and became perhaps the greatest purveyor of words who's ever lived. He's taught (or... is teaching) us something very profound about ourselves: capability is not the whole of the equation. Ability on its own cannot guarantee growth, but it can often result in decay. Discussion does not inherently lead to *connection*. Population is not a cure for isolation.\n\nThat said, I must begrudgingly admit to you that I, myself am one of the 100 million users who've depended upon a \"very meaningful\" Fuckbook group for a \"physical support structure\" for which I have Fuck to thank.\n\nI've spent half of my existence watching cheesy barnstorming movies, whirling around die-cast biplanes, seeking out stories from old pilots - military and commercial, and eventually trained to become one myself. As regular activities at young ages do, aviation became deeply ingrained into my identity, but my local community is *very* sparse - it's not exactly *cool*, these days. On Fuckbook, an unofficial group for members of the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association has allowed me to stay connected to the rest of the world's Soaring Nerds, which is no small deal. It's the only forum which I am compelled to participate in with 100% sincerity and emotional effect.\n\nPhotos of members standing proudly next to their first airplane, or of adolescent students in a similar pose after their first solo, or of three old white rubes on a hangar picnic, laughing around a fold-up table full of rudimentary ham sandwiches in front of two gleaming Stearmans...\n\nThey tug around on my heart like nothing else in life can.\n\nI stopped flying lessons at 16 because I began to see behind the naivety of my childhood perception of what it meant to fly commercially and realized that I was unequipped for- and uninterested in the sort of challenges it presented. I haven't flown in seven years, but the community will *always* have a tremendous dividend of my core being. \n\nThese days, not a single person in my day-to-day life knows or cares about aviation, which wouldn't be laudable whatsoever - it's not exactly the most relevant goingson at the moment - were it not so *emotionally* necessary for me. \n\nA few days ago, a member shared a photo with the group of Charles Lindbergh's modified Ryan cockpit, captioned \"what airplane am I?\"\n\nIn my youth, Lindbergh filled my closest equivalent to the 'childhood hero' role. My grandmother bought me a first-edition copy of *The Spirit of St.Louis* from a small town bookshop when I was six or seven, and I carried it *literally everywhere* with me until middle school. I watched the Jimmy Stewart film tens and tens of times, and I cried when I saw the *Spirit* in the flesh at the Smithsonian, yet I've *never* had an informed conversation about any of it with another human being. It really warmed me to see how many of the comments were correct answers. \n\nBreaking news: it's nice to know that there are other people on Earth who give a shit about the same things you do.\n\nAgain - aspiration should always be encouraged. This is Fuck's vision for his creation, and it *is* feasible, even for myself. At least his public persona - however valid or invalid it may be - is making a huge effort to have positive consequence, even if his idiocy is imbuing itself within all of humanity.\n\nFuck is too powerful to be exempted from responsibility for what Fuckbook's done to the Western psyche over the past decade, but - like the Christian god - perhaps all we need require is his repentance.\n\n*I Refuse to Die Clicking*\n\n#media #spectacle\n\n<!--comment-->","views":1278,"updated":"2023-09-27T22:44:18Z","tags":["media","spectacle"],"type":null,"title":"Mark Fuck and the Goofy Godheads","slug":"mark-zuckerberg","appearance":"norm","language":"en","rtl":false,"created":"2017-05-08T20:00:00Z","images":["https:\/\/i.snap.as\/TP5r1uV.jpg"],"collection":{"public":false,"alias":"bilge","total_posts":0,"title":"The Psalms","verification_link":"","description":"A <a href=\"https:\/\/davidblue.wtf\/db.vcf\">narcoleptic yokel<\/a> on software and culture.","style_sheet":"","views":177027,"monetization_pointer":""},"paid":false},{"id":"19tqa5tqngbaf7sc","body":"![Duga 3](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/SYiu70i.jpg)\n\n## *Extratone* is sustained by an ongoing passion for New Culture and a duty to further its voices. \n\nLaunched on May 18th, 2016, *Extratone* is an online magazine covering technology, music, culture, and media from an exclusively-youthful perspective.

Perhaps it’s not immediately evident as *the coolest thing*, but if “staying informed” and grass roots-ing brands are still as hip as they appear to be, email newsletters *should* soon become so groovy that you’ll begin leaving the house for a down-the-street coffee shop *just to be seen reading them.*\n\n## Welcome to the wonderful world of *aggregation*.\n\nIn many ways, email newsletters are the antithesis of (and medication for) Facebook’s school of ruminate aggregation. You know - the doctrine that will forever be remembered as the original intellectual catalyst for the downfall of human civilization. The skimming and the jumping… how many Facebook users could I fool by simply sending featured images, headlines, and abstracts for social cards without any hyperlinked destination? Could I manage to get Donald Tump elected President of the United States by way of Scrolling Hypnosis, alone?\n\nStaying *informed* is a habit of time-honored traditions. Gramps has stopped by Bill’s General Goods every weekday morning for twenty years with a handful of change because *The Sleepyville Monitor* is a part of his identity - dependent upon- and accountable to his trust. We’ve continued into 21st century news media as if a digital equivalent of his readership would be *so* difficult to fathom that legacy publications are best-off forcing the standards of print onto the web instead of investing in research\/experimentation, which is why the fucking *New York Times* still sends your handset away to a separate *mobile version* of their site - a horrible remnant of browsing from the oughts that’s rarely seen on *blogs*, these days, much less on properties of titanic news powerhouses.\n\nFor whatever reason, most of the industry has behaved as if Grandpa’s sort of routines no longer exist in day-to-day life, but - if anything - our Automated Hell is *vastly* more saturated with them, no? Unless you’re sequestered away in a diligently self-made *Email-Free Zone*, you’re receiving shit daily. I, myself, am considerably proud of my ~60,000 unread emails, and I’ve conceded to the vast majority of the popup opt-ins I’ve encountered since shortly after our launch because I rarely found myself visiting\/reading undesirable web.\n\n“I don’t email” is a sentiment I hear from young people often, which is perfectly fine. I don’t vote!\n\nIf it’s true that “nobody wants that,” nobody should be participating in the democratic process. Yes, I’ve experienced the *no patience for more than 300 words* phase of life, and I understand wholeheartedly the desire to retreat forever from it all. I would much rather exist in an old, open farmhouse with a wife, a garden, no internet, dusty old literature, and two ancient Bentleys than spend all my time crafting mirages in a black mirror, but neither cowardice nor negligence are options for us, right now. This country doesn’t have room for any more.\n\nThat’s not to say that you should be *expected* to read 6 hours of news a day - it’s the media’s (our) job to maintain our own accessibility, and for this, daily\/weekly newsletters are an unbelievably effective method. The meta-aggregators in today’s industry are often paid *exclusively* to ease your digestion, both independently and by mastheads.\n\n[Dave Pell](https:\/\/twitter.com\/davepell) is a superb gateway from the former - an aggregation legend. His daily correspondence - called [*NextDraft*](http:\/\/nextdraft.com) *-* is more often than not the ideal front page of the day.\n\n![POLITICO Playbook](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/FBb5naU.png)\n\nI’m asking those of you youths yet without your own reading habits to trust my taste - if not my authority - and explore some options from my own inbox.\n\nUltimately, you just can’t replace a legacy die-hard-news shop for a good political briefing. The [*POLITICO Playbook*](http:\/\/www.politico.com\/playbook) is the most time-efficient way to keep up with U.S. and World politics as you walk about your life, and many of [*The New Yorker*](https:\/\/www.newyorker.com\/newsletters?mbid=nl)[’s newsletters](https:\/\/www.newyorker.com\/newsletters?mbid=nl) are a great longform, much more visual compliment. For a *slightly* less-chaotic, but still relatively unproven alternative to the former, try [*Axios AM*](https:\/\/www.axios.com\/axios-am\/).\n\n*National Geographic* may seem a bit *old guard*, but has remained a consistently excellent photographic publication. Its print edition has no place but on the poll in tangible media subscription terms, but it *has* been quite depressing, as of late. Turns out, we’ve made quite a dystopia for ourselves, and their ability to encapsulate the world can be overstimulating, at times. If you’d like a bit more control - or are uncompromisingly digital-only - its web edition has matured quite competently, and is elegantly parsed by [their newsletters](https:\/\/members.nationalgeographic.com\/). (You’ll need to create an account, if you don’t already have one.) \n\n![Medium Digest](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/JP71lXK.png)\n\nIt’s no secret that Medium has been on the decline, lately - and it’s always required a particular sort of tolerance - but *The Daily Digest* still delivers a few important essays, occasionally. And of course - there are options by regularity and topic, which you can fiddle with [here](https:\/\/medium.com\/me\/settings) when logged in.\n\nOn the more innovative end of the industry, there’s [*The Outline*](https:\/\/theoutline.com\/post\/1125\/subscribe-to-the-outline-newsletter)[’s newsletter](https:\/\/theoutline.com\/post\/1125\/subscribe-to-the-outline-newsletter), which - being the property of a more deliberate, gorgeous, open-web publication - is a bit underwhelming, but then again… why aren’t you just looking at the site, anyway? [*The Pudding*](https:\/\/pudding.cool\/)’s output may be sparse, but - again - just… *look at it.* I can’t claim to have made much use of the information presented in their gorgeous visual essays, but it sure is fascinating.\n\n*The Verge*’s [Command Line](https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/newsletter) is often so clever, *it can almost make tech news engaging*. (Our very own [*The Tone*](http:\/\/bit.ly\/thetone) is directly modeled after it, visually.) *WIRED*’s [newsletter](https:\/\/www.wired.com\/newsletter) isn’t bad either - it’d be excellent if its parent website wasn’t so *fucking broken.*\n\nThen there’s [*War Is Boring*](https:\/\/warisboring.com\/) *-* a tactical\/tech news site? I recently discovered. “From drones to AKs, high technology to low politics.” I wouldn’t describe it as a primary read for me, but it’s still nice to see what the Big Boys are up to, once in a while. (I am mostly just waiting attentively for the *U.S.S. Iowa* to be put up for auction.)\n\nIf you’re a filthy word nerd like myself, it’s likely you’ve seen a Tweet or two from the [Haggard Hawks](https:\/\/twitter.com\/HaggardHawks) account - [Paul Anthony Jones](http:\/\/www.paulanthonyjones.com\/)’ highly-educated musings on “obscure words, language & etymology facts.” After an excellent few years of playful indulgences, the project now has a whole DweebNet with a [newsletter](http:\/\/www.haggardhawks.com\/newsletter) that always fascinates, if a bit dryly. What did you expect?\n\n*The Poetry Foundation* can also be [easily convinced](https:\/\/www.poetryfoundation.org\/newsletter) to send you their Poem of the Day, and biweekly newsletter.\n\nAnd finally… **the meta media folks**.\n\n*Columbia Journalism Review*’s always the prettiest to look at when it comes to coverage of industry, and their squeaky-clean perspective won me over quite quickly. They send their ultra-clean, editor-compiled [*Weekly Highlights*](http:\/\/archives.cjr.org\/resources\/) every Thursday. [*The American Press Institute*](http:\/\/bit.ly\/apneedtoknow)[’s list](http:\/\/bit.ly\/apneedtoknow) isn’t a bad idea, either. Then, of course, there’s Harvard’s *NiemanLab*, which offers [afternoon and Saturday morning emails](http:\/\/www.niemanlab.org\/subscribe\/). All three often cite the *Pew Research Center*, which offers i[ts own palette of email lists](http:\/\/www.pewresearch.org\/follow-us\/), should you find yourself *hungry for d a t a*. Though, I do not, and I enjoy them.\n\nLanding on the “homepage” of even the most familiar online publications can feel daunting and impersonal, but having an authority on the industry (hopefully, with some sense of humor) parse the torrent and deliver it unto *your personal inbox* can ease the reading process into a *much* more intimate, sensical, enjoyable, and productive expenditure of your valuable time.\n\nFor a publication of our scale, the routine of a newsletter can act first as a simple reminder of our existence, and mature into a way to reach out directly to our audience in a distinctly *magazine* methodology - one which pervades a real, consequential relationship with consumers.\n\nAnd it’s d i g i t a l !!!!\n\n<!--comment-->\n\n#meta","views":416,"updated":"2023-03-23T14:07:33Z","tags":["meta"],"type":null,"title":"The Email Chic","slug":"email-chic","appearance":"norm","language":"en","rtl":false,"created":"2017-07-11T13:32:37Z","images":["https:\/\/i.snap.as\/TdR9BlV.jpeg","https:\/\/i.snap.as\/FBb5naU.png","https:\/\/i.snap.as\/JP71lXK.png"],"collection":{"public":false,"alias":"bilge","total_posts":0,"title":"The Psalms","verification_link":"","description":"A <a href=\"https:\/\/davidblue.wtf\/db.vcf\">narcoleptic yokel<\/a> on software and culture.","style_sheet":"","views":177027,"monetization_pointer":""},"paid":false},{"id":"8nmn3425493n0ybl","body":"#### by [David Blue](http:\/\/twitter.com\/neoyokel)\n\n![VR Virgin](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/4LDha0S.jpg)\n\n## A late geezer’s first go at the dystopian VR experience\n\nEarlier this year, [Tim](http:\/\/extratone.com\/cactus) and I had the opportunity to try virtual reality at the [True\/False Film Festival](http:\/\/www.extratone.com\/truefalse\/) in a dark, curtained side room of a commandeered Columbia art gallery, but we were both much too intoxicated and loopy those last few hours of the fest, and we bailed. Call us cowards if you must — *immersion* can be a scary concept to those of us who grew up reading science fiction, before the existence of the modern video game console. I’ve wanted just 30 seconds or so with a pair of goggles, just to have an idea of what the increasing number of Oculus-blinded pedestrians surrounding me are looking at. Thanks to Isiah, I was finally caught up last night with a few VR YouTube videos and *Farpoint*’s introduction on a PlayStation 4.\n\nFirst, Isiah brings me the headset and describes in detail how exactly to adjust it, but I forget it all and simply try to shove it directly and violently on my face. Eventually, he takes it back and simply mounts and adjusts it around my monstrous skull — like you would for a toddler — and I lay eyes on the console for the first time. For whatever reason, it never occurred to me that general GUI wouldn’t simply be displayed in 2D, but by a literal *virtual display*, layed out in front of me like a large, floor-mounted touch workstation. I’m astonished by my ability to turn away from it to look at the rest of *Goggleworld*, which is nothing but a deeply black void.\n\nFrom my previous world, I hear Isiah and Hawthorn discussing what to show me first, and YouTube is the settled-upon environment. As the application is restarted in “VR Mode,” its startup screen is what *really* establishes the truth — I have *gone virtual*. I cannot use my hands to shield my eyes from the branding’s glaring watermark and terrifying red light. At its home menu, Isiah simply selects the “VR” tab, revealing a selection of thumbnails for algorithmically-recommended VR-shot videos on the service.\n\nTo begin, I am mounted on the tail of a superbike as it’s raced around an American desert circuit. It takes a few seconds for high resolution to buffer, leaving me briefly in a pixelized hell that would surely make anyone sick, were they exposed very long. (I was especially excited to become nauseous, to no avail.) At the getgo, I am occupied with the rider’s butt since it’s center-frame if I stand in my usual posture. Isiah points out the hovering HUD to my left containing a selection of simulated digital instruments (tachometer, 7-segment speedo, etc.) Its presence would suggest that the purpose of my virtual passengership is to witness the lap as a motorsport enthusiast, but the rear of the rider obscures most of my view forward — I cannot admire his line as one would viewing a GoPro-or-otherwise POV of the same event, so I decide to try and figure out which track I am hurried through. Though the vehicle is tossed about in the required movements of motorbike operation, I myself (the VR capture device) am impressively gyrostabilized, and the image, static, as if I’m *actually* hovering above the pair as they moved along. I spin left and right, spotting a small gaggle of miniature wind turbines and two wilting hilltop trees in the foreground. Behind them, small sand dunes fill the space, all the way to the horizon.\n\nAfter a few minutes, I am finally relieved early of my cutless lap for a short *National Geographic* documentary on a Viking revival festival in Poland. I’m introduced to its Big Boys by a series of aerial shots (presumably by drone, which is awfully un-Vikinglike) as they row their Big Boat up(?) a relatively wide, tree-lined river. In contrast with the lap, the jump cuts become a bit disorienting — I am eventually jumped *in* the boat for a moment, next to the sweaty, bearded lads — a few of whom are shirtless. I notice a blurry church on the distant bank. Suddenly, I float briskly across the small no man’s land between two rapidly advancing battle lines of Nordic Nerds with real, era-specific weapons and way too much free time. More lingering drone shots follow from just a few feet above the ensuing conflict. Outside, Isiah confirms Hawthorn’s suggestion that this is, indeed, *the one where they use real weapons* as I notice a pile of three or four men lying against each other, motionless on the ground, right-of-center in the nearest line, and mull over the sure disturbance of all this immersion the festival has allowed in welcoming the presence of the surely-buzzing drone. *I guess they’re dead*.\n\nAfter the conflict, I am subjected to a dreamier, narrated montage accompanied by cheesy synthesized orchestral music and featuring disproportionately a particular man with a shiny, tatted bald head and rather large feet with rather small toes, which he likes to wiggle during these particular conversations. Thanks to VR’s omniencompassing perspective, I am allowed to observe his wiggling in his every appearance. The tone of the background music and the prevalence of relaxed, conversing couples and sunsets in the scenes suggest romanticism is the montage’s theme, but for me, it is the bald man’s feet — I am too busy conversing with my two friends, across the divide, in this world, to listen to any of what is said. Considering that YouTube collects the dimensional data regarding where the user looks, and for how long, I make an effort to bend my neck up and down in extremes, and notice a patch of washed-out sky, distorting in the distance, and ponder what — if anything — we have gained in this technology.\n\n![VR Vertical](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/ihtaDMF.jpg)\n\nDoes an increase in the raw amount of visual data available to the viewer actually make motion picture storytelling more effective? In the few minutes of my VR taste test, I *did* gain quite a bit of volition over an equivalent 2D experience, but it didn’t seem like I’d instinctively used it to gain much else. If one is specifically interested in the shrubbery around a racetrack, or the more nuanced undulations of a Viking’s foot, they can more likely than not find a standard video on the World Wide Web that would more efficiently entertain them. In specific situations, of course, a producer can undoubtedly benefit by the ability to capture in 360 degrees, but — in any sort of cinema, especially — it seems unnecessarily sacrificial to relinquish entirely the narrative directorial control of shot framing to their audience. However, I am the antiexpert on this subject, obviously. My take on the viability of VR is Virtually Redundant and — quite possibly — very wrong, but my time in its hell is not over yet.\n\nIsiah explains that it is time for me to *game*, and asks if I’d like to try “the one with the hands, or the one with the gun.” As always, I choose the firearm, as the “hands” have not been found yet and the hypothetical image immediately offered up by my imagination is of rusty iron shackles.

Call us cowards if you must — *immersion* can be a scary concept to those of us who grew up reading science fiction, before the existence of the modern video game console. I’ve wanted just 30 seconds or so with a pair of goggles, just to have an idea of what the increasing number of Oculus-blinded pedestrians surrounding me are looking at. Thanks to Isiah, I was finally caught up last night with a few VR YouTube videos and *Farpoint*’s introduction on a PlayStation 4.\n\nFirst, Isiah brings me the headset and describes in detail how exactly to adjust it, but I forget it all and simply try to shove it directly and violently on my face. Eventually, he takes it back and simply mounts and adjusts it around my monstrous skull — like you would for a toddler — and I lay eyes on the console for the first time. For whatever reason, it never occurred to me that general GUI wouldn’t simply be displayed in 2D, but by a literal *virtual display*, layed out in front of me like a large, floor-mounted touch workstation. I’m astonished by my ability to turn away from it to look at the rest of *Goggleworld*, which is nothing but a deeply black void.\n\nFrom my previous world, I hear Isiah and Hawthorn discussing what to show me first, and YouTube is the settled-upon environment. As the application is restarted in “VR Mode,” its startup screen is what *really* establishes the truth — I have *gone virtual*. I cannot use my hands to shield my eyes from the branding’s glaring watermark and terrifying red light. At its home menu, Isiah simply selects the “VR” tab, revealing a selection of thumbnails for algorithmically-recommended VR-shot videos on the service.\n\nTo begin, I am mounted on the tail of a superbike as it’s raced around an American desert circuit. It takes a few seconds for high resolution to buffer, leaving me briefly in a pixelized hell that would surely make anyone sick, were they exposed very long. (I was especially excited to become nauseous, to no avail.) At the getgo, I am occupied with the rider’s butt since it’s center-frame if I stand in my usual posture. Isiah points out the hovering HUD to my left containing a selection of simulated digital instruments (tachometer, 7-segment speedo, etc.) Its presence would suggest that the purpose of my virtual passengership is to witness the lap as a motorsport enthusiast, but the rear of the rider obscures most of my view forward — I cannot admire his line as one would viewing a GoPro-or-otherwise POV of the same event, so I decide to try and figure out which track I am hurried through. Though the vehicle is tossed about in the required movements of motorbike operation, I myself (the VR capture device) am impressively gyrostabilized, and the image, static, as if I’m *actually* hovering above the pair as they moved along. I spin left and right, spotting a small gaggle of miniature wind turbines and two wilting hilltop trees in the foreground. Behind them, small sand dunes fill the space, all the way to the horizon.\n\nAfter a few minutes, I am finally relieved early of my cutless lap for a short *National Geographic* documentary on a Viking revival festival in Poland. I’m introduced to its Big Boys by a series of aerial shots (presumably by drone, which is awfully un-Vikinglike) as they row their Big Boat up(?) a relatively wide, tree-lined river. In contrast with the lap, the jump cuts become a bit disorienting — I am eventually jumped *in* the boat for a moment, next to the sweaty, bearded lads — a few of whom are shirtless. I notice a blurry church on the distant bank. Suddenly, I float briskly across the small no man’s land between two rapidly advancing battle lines of Nordic Nerds with real, era-specific weapons and way too much free time. More lingering drone shots follow from just a few feet above the ensuing conflict. Outside, Isiah confirms Hawthorn’s suggestion that this is, indeed, *the one where they use real weapons* as I notice a pile of three or four men lying against each other, motionless on the ground, right-of-center in the nearest line, and mull over the sure disturbance of all this immersion the festival has allowed in welcoming the presence of the surely-buzzing drone. *I guess they’re dead*.\n\nAfter the conflict, I am subjected to a dreamier, narrated montage accompanied by cheesy synthesized orchestral music and featuring disproportionately a particular man with a shiny, tatted bald head and rather large feet with rather small toes, which he likes to wiggle during these particular conversations. Thanks to VR’s omniencompassing perspective, I am allowed to observe his wiggling in his every appearance. The tone of the background music and the prevalence of relaxed, conversing couples and sunsets in the scenes suggest romanticism is the montage’s theme, but for me, it is the bald man’s feet — I am too busy conversing with my two friends, across the divide, in this world, to listen to any of what is said. Considering that YouTube collects the dimensional data regarding where the user looks, and for how long, I make an effort to bend my neck up and down in extremes, and notice a patch of washed-out sky, distorting in the distance, and ponder what — if anything — we have gained in this technology.\n\n![VR Vertical](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/ihtaDMF.jpg)\n\nDoes an increase in the raw amount of visual data available to the viewer actually make motion picture storytelling more effective? In the few minutes of my VR taste test, I *did* gain quite a bit of volition over an equivalent 2D experience, but it didn’t seem like I’d instinctively used it to gain much else. If one is specifically interested in the shrubbery around a racetrack, or the more nuanced undulations of a Viking’s foot, they can more likely than not find a standard video on the World Wide Web that would more efficiently entertain them. In specific situations, of course, a producer can undoubtedly benefit by the ability to capture in 360 degrees, but — in any sort of cinema, especially — it seems unnecessarily sacrificial to relinquish entirely the narrative directorial control of shot framing to their audience. However, I am the anti-expert on this subject, obviously. My take on the viability of VR is Virtually Redundant and — quite possibly — very wrong, but my time in its hell is not over yet.\n\nIsiah explains that it is time for me to *game*, and asks if I’d like to try “the one with **the hands**, or the one with **the gun**.” As always, I choose the firearm, as the “hands” have not been found yet and the hypothetical image immediately offered up by my imagination is of rusty iron shackles. The Infinite Blackness has returned, and I cannot see beyond it to determine what my host is up to. Then, it becomes outer space — filling with thousands of star-like white dots. The light-blue outline of a virtual PlayStation controller appears where I assume him to be, unattached and bumbling about. Soon, it jaggedly approaches, and I feel him hand it to me.

If the purpose of film writing is to help an audience determine whether or not a work is worth spending their time and money to see it in theaters or otherwise, I can tell you — even within my bias and limited authority -that this one just… isn’t.\n\n#film #local","views":554,"updated":"2022-06-06T03:11:08Z","tags":["film","local"],"type":null,"title":"Three Billboards Outside Silva, North Carolina","slug":"three-billboards-outside-ebbing-missouri-review","appearance":"norm","language":"en","rtl":false,"created":"2018-01-26T19:00:00Z","images":["https:\/\/i.snap.as\/C271IoF.jpeg"],"collection":{"public":false,"alias":"bilge","total_posts":0,"title":"The Psalms","verification_link":"","description":"A <a href=\"https:\/\/davidblue.wtf\/db.vcf\">narcoleptic yokel<\/a> on software and culture.","style_sheet":"","views":177027,"monetization_pointer":""},"paid":false},{"id":"8mggcfbj15189r2r","body":"## A 'fun' movie\n\n#### by [David Blue](http:\/\/twitter.com\/neoyokel)\n\n![Nicolas Cage](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/HitpxbS.jpeg)\n\nThe Earth will reach its maximum occupancy load (12 billion) when I am in my mid-fifities, meaning there’ll be more than twice as many gorging, shitting, shooting, complaining, and lying human beings than there were when I started, and perhaps Brian Taylor’s *Mom and Dad* is in fact a reasoned argument for a particular solution to our inevitable plight.

It is an authoritative and pseudofascist money machine that hides behind an insultingly thin veneer of celebrated individualism. These are the sentiments I see reflected in the people and organizations around me. I originally [posted this on r\/Portland](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Portland\/comments\/8jzr8m\/the_white_island\/) and it made white people mad.*\n\nIn my despair about the complex nature of the World as it is changing, I shall create for myself and those like me an Island where the things about us which I think should be celebrated can be so freely — where Me (among us) means something again. Where our money will mean something again because meaning is — above all — what people like me should seek. I write this prospectus for my Island — let’s call it White Island — on a thirty-year-old typewriter because the physicality of these words is almost the entirety of what imbues them with meaning, and I believe the particulars of analog existence are lost on the World in a tragically big way as it is changing. On White Island, at least, the physical shall be most Holy, and its intrinsic worth shall be worshiped freely so that the treasures of our past are not lost.\n\nAs it is changing, the World is growing noisy with voices that are unlike mine, and the grasp on the conversation which I was promised in my upbringing is slipping alarmingly away with each new day. I believe these new sounds detract from my celebration of the things in life that give mine meaning: bicycles, beanies, body art, brewing, electric guitars, and the hair that grows on my face. Every day, I am more and more afraid that my voice will be lost in them, and if it is lost, I am afraid there will be nothing left of Me or my meaning. This thought worries me like none other, and — as long as people like me have sufficient economic and social resources to do so — we should make for ourselves an Island away from the new World and her noises so that we may continue to live comfortably in a soundscape of only our own creation, as is our birthright and grand tradition.\n\nOur parents and their parents before them were born into a more careful and physical World where respect for their crafts, their voices, and their beards was a universal right. If we are to follow in their generous footsteps and give wholeheartedly our own equivalent of these to the World, we should be unequivocal in our expectation of its continued reciprocation and appreciation for them. As long as we are able, we should not have to imagine an alternative way of life in which our effort is less recognized or generally important. This we should refrain from doing not only for the sake of our own comfort, but for the good of the whole World, even if it is no longer interested in recognizing the value of our contributions to it.\n\nAs our trusted methodologies are washed away in their new noise, our Island shall be a bastion for them. We will remember that a cup of coffee should take at least twenty minutes to prepare. We will not forget the culturalizing nuances in the taste of the most diminutive brews. We will sacrifice whatever is necessary in order to purify our foods from the poisonous nutritional sins of the processed masses. We shall enforce our own wise, time-honored priorities as we can only within a space that is truly ours, where only people like ourselves will feel and be sincerely welcome.\n\n#culture","views":499,"updated":"2022-04-04T08:04:06Z","tags":["culture"],"type":null,"title":"The White Island","slug":"white-island","appearance":"norm","language":"en","rtl":false,"created":"2018-05-16T19:00:00Z","images":["https:\/\/i.snap.as\/XKiEDGD.jpg"],"collection":{"public":false,"alias":"bilge","total_posts":0,"title":"The Psalms","verification_link":"","description":"A <a href=\"https:\/\/davidblue.wtf\/db.vcf\">narcoleptic yokel<\/a> on software and culture.","style_sheet":"","views":177027,"monetization_pointer":""},"paid":false},{"id":"m2vgt85qbdhoyyno","body":"![Extratone Brand Preview](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/Ee30Mig.jpg)\n\n## Download Extratone logos and other image assets.\n\n[**Extratone Brand Kit 2020**](https:\/\/www.dropbox.com\/s\/i9jpdyna0z0hdx1\/Extratone%20Brand%20Kit.zip)","views":593,"updated":"2020-06-19T07:35:02Z","tags":[],"type":null,"title":"Brand","slug":"brand","appearance":"norm","language":"en","rtl":false,"created":"2018-05-18T07:30:00Z","images":["https:\/\/i.snap.as\/Ee30Mig.jpg"],"collection":{"public":false,"alias":"extratone","total_posts":0,"title":"Extratone","verification_link":"","description":"For the New Curious.","style_sheet":"","views":182661,"monetization_pointer":""},"paid":false},{"id":"y09nqv4ayubtc7tz","body":"![Googleplex](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/tCRNZM7.jpg)\n\n## What I have long predicted is now coming to pass: Google believes it should assume control.\n\n<!--more-->\n\n<audio controls>\n  <source src=\"https:\/\/davidblue.wtf\/audio\/Google.m4a\">\n<\/audio>\n\nOut of all the technology companies that have made my knees knock and my voice hoarse and my [Tweets manic](http:\/\/bit.ly\/bluegoogle) as a technoheretic in the past several years, Jumbo Google would easily take home the winning trophy for Dystopian of the Millennium. I have been rehearsing an especially dear pet prophecy of mine, unsolicited, to family, friends, and podcast guests since 2011 in which I end up arguing quite convincingly that Google is a dead ringer for the 16th-century Vatican: an inherently self-isolating organization with an absolute monopoly yielding *gargantuan* levels of essentially passive income from a service which nearly everybody transacts with, but only Google understands (and is therefore assumed to be its only possible provider,) which inevitably develops such a distance from the rest of the populace and their way of life (in tandem with total notoriety and celebrity among them all) not intentionally out of malice, but from the delusion of mythically-bestowed philanthropic duty that is borned of and compounded by this economic and cultural isolation in a perpetual accumulation of power and wealth that radicalizes the monopolizers — the majority already highly predisposed to zeal as they would’ve needed to be in order to find themselves in this singular, universally powerful position over every other class — and leaves their egocentric minds to wander exempt from all criticism save for that of fellow radicalized monopolizers, who together begin to feel more and more comfortable wondering aloud about themselves in increasingly fantastic presumptions: *what if all of this was bestowed upon us because we are superior to them? What if it is our* **divine responsibility** *as superior beings to take charge and shepherd the common people as our sheep — for they cannot possibly know as well as we what is truly best for them?*\n\nYou see it, right? And you can feel a very specific flavor of terror that is both awed by the scale of the circumstances created by so few human minds and sincerely amused by the absoluteness of your own inability to alter them in any way. Perhaps you even recognize this taste as one perfected by Christianity’s ancient advertising business, but Google knows so much about you that it’s rumored to’ve been selling user data *to* the Judeochristian God for some time now at a 10% discount, and so we extrapolate and anticipate, yes?\n\nOf course, it’s admittedly satisfying for me to deliver you to this godfearing place in the most perverse *look what I saw first that you didn’t see because you’re just not as bright but lucky for you, I’m so fucking generous with my wisdom* sort of thinking around which the entire personas and livelihoods of fringe movement fanatics are built upon, but this is my *one* thing, okay? I’ve been waiting years for the right time to formally argue this theory in depth, and — thanks to this year’s public spotlight finally pivoting on the giants who’ve been silently swallowing their competition and relentlessly forcing their already ridiculous margins higher and higher in relative obscurity for decades, the time has come, indeed. The common people’s trust in Google had a godawful week.\n\n## Don’t Be Evil\n\nOn Monday, [*Gizmodo*](https:\/\/gizmodo.com\/google-employees-resign-in-protest-against-pentagon-con-1825729300)[ reported](https:\/\/gizmodo.com\/google-employees-resign-in-protest-against-pentagon-con-1825729300) that twelve frustrated Google employees were quitting the company in protest of their work assisting the Department of Defense to “implement machine learning to classify images gathered by drones” for the detail fleeting Project Maven, despite some [4000 employee signatures](https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2018\/04\/04\/technology\/google-letter-ceo-pentagon-project.html) on a [letter](http:\/\/extratone.com\/library\/dearsundar.pdf) addressed to CEO Sundar Pichai requesting (in full) that he “cancel this project immediately,” and “draft, publicize, and enforce a clear policy stating that neither Google nor its contractors will ever build warfare technology,” citing the infamous “Don’t Be Evil” motto, which Google [**then proceeded to remove**](https:\/\/gizmodo.com\/google-removes-nearly-all-mentions-of-dont-be-evil-from-1826153393) from its [code of conduct](https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20180504211806\/https:\/\/abc.xyz\/investor\/other\/google-code-of-conduct.html) for the first time in 18 years **the day after** the *New York Times* article went to press, on April 5th.\n\nOn initial approach to the abstract of this story, from the ass to our thoughts arrives an easy narrative of a Silicon Valley mutiny comprised of twelve brave, conscientious souls who’ve been eaten up inside by their complicity in the filthy deals made by their power-obsessed CEO over scotch and cigars in a dark D.C. study — kept awake for months by the sound of his puffing cackles at satellite images of dead toddlers in a bombed-out street.\n\n*Ah ha*, we say. *That man is no good, and he just wouldn’t listen! They knew they didn’t have a choice… They only did what they had to do…*\n\nThe reality of internal disagreements at Google, though, manages to be even more theatrical. The sheer volume of correspondence must surely be beyond anything capable of the enduser’s imagination, so let’s phone a friend: my favorite peek into the day-to-days of inter-Google existence is an [old blog post](http:\/\/bentilly.blogspot.com\/2010\/01\/things-ive-learned-at-google.html) by [Benjamin Tilly](https:\/\/twitter.com\/btilly) on his first month at the company in which he was compelled almost immediately to describe in great detail how best to “deal with a lot of email in gmail” at peak efficiency using shortcuts and labels.\n\n“As you get email, you need to be aggressive about deciding what you need to see, versus what is context specific.”\n\nNow we have a bit better idea of the *aggressive emailing* that was a sure constant on a normal workday at Google in 2010, so it must’ve been deafening after 8 years of Gmail development as 4000 employees no doubt vented, debated, and decided to organize last month, though without making much headway because the leadership’s response was apparently “complicated by the fact that Google claims it is only providing open-source software to Project Maven,” this new knowledge having *significant* effect on our mind’s image of Sundar Pichai’s activities in Washington: he is now swapping seats with a frustrated Colin Powell in order to install OpenOffice onto his desktop from a flash drive, and we recall that Google’s Googleplex headquarters resembles nowhere in modern life more than a brand new playground built in a design language borrowing heavily from *Spy Kids*. And though these Twelve disciples are unnamed for the moment, a few of them could immediately land book deals by going public, and every single one would always have by default not only the badge of “I landed a job at Google,” (which is really to say *I have hit Life’s maximum level cap*,) but “I worked at Google for a while, but ended up quitting to do something else,” which is guaranteed to make you the most interesting, intellectually superior person present in *whatever* crowd for the rest of your life. The ultra-cool [Sarah Cooper](https:\/\/twitter.com\/sarahcpr) quit Google to become a comedian and even [got to talk to Kara Swisher](https:\/\/www.recode.net\/2018\/1\/10\/16871786\/sarah-cooper-comedian-google-dick-costolo-kara-swisher-recode-decode-podcast)!\n\nI won’t pretend to understand big tech’s diminutive bastardization of prestige, but “more than 90 academics” jumping to publish an [open letter](https:\/\/www.icrac.net\/open-letter-in-support-of-google-employees-and-tech-workers\/) (adjacent to a huge *DONATE: Support the Campaign to Stop Killer Robots* button) in which they “write in solidarity with the 3100+ Google employees” who’s terrible boss decided to help some lackeys in the Pentagon set up their email and didn’t text back for a whole hour doesn’t sound 100% sincere. Notably, I don’t know how *or why* the fuck 90 people would go about collaborating on a single document, but if it really was managed, they definitely used Google Docs…\n\nAt one point, it was fun to think about the history of the friendly side-scroller-playing garage ghouls and dorm dorks who gave *cooky*, *wacko* names to their dot com startups in parody and defiance of the lame-ass surname anagrams on the buildings of their established competitors, but those who’ve stuck around have only done so by becoming expert at SUCKING UP EVERYTHING around them, and it pisses me off every day how worried I am that my species will finally be done in by a company with a name like Yahoo! and be known only to a bunch of adolescent interdimensional silicon blobs 30 million years in the future as *that bipedal race who remained dignified until the last 0.01% of their reign on Earth, when in way less than a single generation, they all just went* **FUCKING INSANE** *and blew themselves up because they suddenly hated all sense.*\n\n“Google” is perhaps the worst of these to have to shout in fear and\/or anger in your last moments as it sounds in American English like you’ve startled your subject with a ticklish pinch followed so immediately by an esophagus-busting chokehold that the two events appear simultaneous, and in real English English, it almost always sounds like a parent speaking of a character on a pre-K children’s television programme whom they find quite foul and upsetting, but will manage to refrain from expressing so otherwise because they know that *Teletubbies* shit is the most quickly forgotten stage of television viewership. It’s fascinating how exclusive the word “Google” is to American English because in everything else it really *is* complete nonsense, but lets halt all etymological discussions right now because we’ve only now just finished with Monday.\n\n![Bad Chrome](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/ZcS94oK.png)\n\n## The Soul Ledger\n\nOn Thursday, all of my Google experiences, suppositions, and [soul-detaching screenshots](https:\/\/twitter.com\/FickleCrux\/status\/914767928456749056) were usurped when a thoroughly alarming internal company video called [*The Selfish Ledger*](https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2018\/5\/17\/17344250\/google-x-selfish-ledger-video-data-privacy) was leaked to *The Verge,* which I watched once then and do not want to watch again for the sake of this piece, but I will. Though the big V has been disappointingly timid for years about editorializing — when tech journalism desperately needs some confident, informed opinion more than ever — Vlad Savov’s accompanying article should be read in its entirety, to which I can add my own terror where he perhaps could not.\n\nThe production style is technically identical to that of the very popular thinkpiece-esque, motion-graphics-paired-with-obligatory-sharpie illustrated videos which you find playing at max volume on your mom’s iPad from where she’s fallen asleep on the couch at 9PM, but the repeating stock string soundtrack multiplies one’s discomfort as such that we would all end up in the fetal position without remembering the transition were it not for the appearance of trusty old Dank Jenkins, who’s face I thankfully associate heavily enough with [his infamous ](https:\/\/twitter.com\/richarddawkins\/status\/389432783304548352)[*down-and-out*](https:\/\/twitter.com\/richarddawkins\/status\/389432783304548352)[ Tweet](https:\/\/twitter.com\/richarddawkins\/status\/389432783304548352) to be a welcome respite in attention before the very scary hypothesis for which it’s been buttering me up, as best summed by Vlad:\n\n> The system would be able to “plug gaps in its knowledge and refine its model of human behavior” — not just your particular behavior or mine, but that of the entire human species. “By thinking of user data as multigenerational,” explains Foster, “it becomes possible for emerging users to benefit from the preceding generation’s behaviors and decisions.” Foster imagines mining the database of human behavior for patterns, “sequencing” it like the human genome, and making “increasingly accurate predictions about decisions and future behaviors.”  \n\nThe next time the *what if they do something scary* question comes up in a casual conversation about Google, you’ll have something a lot more substantial than just speculation. Or will you? *The Verge* reached out for comment and got an awfully convenient response.\n\n> This is a thought-experiment by the Design team from years ago that uses a technique known as ‘speculative design’ to explore uncomfortable ideas and concepts in order to provoke discussion and debate.  \n\nWow! Leave it up to grand ole Googe to reveal the ultimate excuse for just about any suggestion or behavior, though it does seem almost *deliberately* uncomfortable, doesn’t it? No matter — whether or not this video was ever about a project or tangible product development, or simply to *explore uncomfortable ideas* because it is proof that the company has reached that critical Vatican stage — if you’ll remember — where they now feel comfortable *exploring* Very Bad, but Very easily made Real Ideas amongst themselves about what would happen if they allowed their system to *nudge its users* around a different, slightly less optimal route to the bar, let’s say — without their knowledge — in order for the system to collect traffic data for the sake of its own interests? Which would be, technically, in the interest of all Ledger users now and in the future, so why not?\n\n> The ledger could be given a focus, shifting it from a system which not only tracks our behavior, but offers direction towards a desired result.”  \n\nThis, my dear privacy-obsessed friends, is the *real issue* with data collection — its power over huge groups by way of their behavior and it is *never* going to be remedied in any significant way by ad-blockers or VPNs because the EndUser shall always out number you 50 to 1, even decades from now. EndUser does not understand — or, crucially, *have any desire* to understand anything technical about what leads to the PewDiePie videos playing on his filthy screen. Here’s a great opportunity to escape Silicon Valley’s technolibertarianism and resign your Darwinian empathy in favor of meaningful and truly-effective action: if you want to avoid a future Google Church (or Google Government, more worryingly,) you should invest your time, effort, and knowledge into electing officials more capable of understanding and regulating Big Tech.\n\n## Google Government\n\nThe internet as it stands is made possible by Google as *the* goto resource for online advertising. In 2016, “Google held 75.8 percent of the search ad market, bringing in $24.6 billion in revenue from search ads,” [according to ](https:\/\/www.recode.net\/2017\/3\/14\/14890122\/google-search-ad-market-share-growth)[*Recode*](https:\/\/www.recode.net\/2017\/3\/14\/14890122\/google-search-ad-market-share-growth). By 2019, “that’s expected to grow to $36.62 billion in revenue, or 80.2 percent of the market.” Google’s edge in user behavior and targeted advertising combined with their extensive resources available developers to integrate independent platforms with Google’s software services at various levels makes it very difficult for any advertising-funded individual or organization to compete online without dipping in to the Google universe. YouTube — a Google property since 2006 — has actively invested in and supported a new career path entirely within their own platform that is rapidly becoming [popularly aspired-to by young children](https:\/\/metro.co.uk\/2018\/01\/19\/children-now-more-likely-to-want-to-become-youtubers-than-actors-7241396\/), while the reality of existence as a full-time YouTuber is [far less glamorous](https:\/\/medium.com\/@robertoblake\/what-nobody-tells-you-about-being-a-youtuber-the-youtube-middle-class-378b77eb8bc9) than the immediately-visible surface would indicate, and the effort already expended by my generation in its pursuit has already [made us insane](http:\/\/bit.ly\/searchchildren).\n\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-lang=\"en\" data-dnt=\"true\" data-link-color=\"#00006b\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">thanks google. <a href=\"https:\/\/t.co\/1jRtrD77R3\">pic.twitter.com\/1jRtrD77R3<\/a><\/p>&mdash; David Blue (@NeoYokel) <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/NeoYokel\/status\/914767928456749056?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">October 2, 2017<\/a><\/blockquote> <script async src=\"https:\/\/platform.twitter.com\/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"><\/script>\n\nSo, what would the internet look like if Google didn’t exist? We know they’ve been working with the government now on various projects, but what if some terrible exposed transgression of theirs suddenly warranted an immediate shutdown and seizure of all Google properties? Well, we know from [a post on Quora](https:\/\/www.quora.com\/What-would-happen-if-Google-were-to-shut-down-for-30-minutes) by Googler Ashish Kedia that even 5 years ago, the sudden absence of Google for “2–3 mins” set the internet into a bit of a panic, reducing overall traffic by 40%. In the time since, we’ve all grown exponentially more dependent on Google properties: billions of people rely on Google Maps for directions and, thousands of companies (including the Pentagon and other government institutions) rely on Gmail and GSuites for intercommunication, file sharing, task management, etc., and more and more academic institutions rely on Chromebook devices running connection-dependent operating systems. It’s not much of a stretch to argue that Google’s sudden disappearance would constitute a Civil Emergency in the United States, which will only become a stronger and more serious incentive for regulatory bodies to look the other way.\n\nThough the tangible results of advertising have been quantified significantly in the past 20 years, one can’t help but wonder after watching YouTube ads for the new Mercedes-Benz S-Class on toy unboxing videos if the companies who spend big bucks on Google advertising understand where their money is going, but they know that if they *don’t* advertise there, their competitors will. This, of course, is a fundamental practice of a monopoly, and it’s yielded Google so much fucking money that they cannot possibly spend it fast enough, as evidenced by [their investments in life extension](https:\/\/www.vox.com\/science-and-health\/2017\/4\/27\/15409672\/google-calico-secretive-aging-mortality-research) — so that, perhaps, they will have more time on Earth to figure it out.\n\nWhen you build a collection of the world’s smartest people in a [self-sufficient environment](https:\/\/www.newyorker.com\/business\/currency\/googles-monastic-vision-for-the-future-of-work) that discourages exploration of other lifestyles and ideas, and you sustain the society with a gargantuan, relatively low-maintenance revenue stream, you create a culture which is not only well-primed for isolationism, but is also extremely inefficient. In fact, with its [vast collection of abandoned products and properties](https:\/\/www.computerworlduk.com\/galleries\/it-vendors\/google-graveyard-3508070\/), Google must surely be one of the most inefficient companies in history. Thinking back on recent software releases along with its [recent entries into the hardware space](https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2017\/10\/4\/16405184\/rick-osterloh-interview-new-google-hardware-vision-htc-deal), Google is also one of the worst competing tech companies. Very little aside from Gmail, Google Photos, Google Maps, and Chrome have found their place or garnered significant usership. Google Play Music is unintuitive and impossible, Google Allo and Google+ are all but forgotten addendums to other services, and Google Search — its core, original function — has been [out of control](https:\/\/theoutline.com\/post\/1430\/google-finally-realized-that-racist-search-results-are-a-problem) for years, and all of them are designed blandly and excruciatingly tiring to look at.\n\n## Google Shun\n\nIf this all has stirred nothing more in you than a desire to eliminate Google from your own online life as much as possible, there *are* alternatives in almost every one of the sphere’s they dominate. As of late, [DuckDuckGo](https:\/\/duckduckgo.com\/about) has accumulated a fair amount of [buzz and coverage](https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/global\/2018\/may\/19\/google-facebook-security-data-duckduckgo) as a private, more relevant alternative to Google’s plain old search engine. Though it is clever enough to list us as the first result for “extratone,” I’ve found it simply insufficient as a replacement in my own life because, essentially, it rarely delivers what I’m looking for. By contrast, [Dropbox Paper](http:\/\/dropbox.com\/paper) is such an elegant cloud notetaking and word processing software that it makes Google Docs look simply idiotic (and warrants its own review very shortly.) For getting around, know that [MapQuest](https:\/\/www.mapquest.com) is not only [still around](https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/business\/economy\/does-mapquest-still-exist-as-a-matter-of-fact-it-does\/2015\/05\/22\/995d2532-fa5d-11e4-a13c-193b1241d51a_story.html) — it’s now a very competitive mobile navigation app.\n\nI, myself, have allowed Google as complete of access to my information and behavior as possible because I believe “privacy” is a completely futile endeavor if one wishes to be a part of society, though I do often use alternatives to Google services simply because I *fucking hate* the way they look. If you want a more complete list of services and software that allow one to shun the Google God entirely, you’ll be forced to seek out less dignified sources like [*Lifehacker*](https:\/\/lifehacker.com\/5876794\/going-google-free-the-best-alternatives-to-google-services-on-the-web) and [Reddit](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/antigoogle\/) and decide if the additional time you’ll spend using most of them to accomplish the same tasks is really worth your digital angst.\n\nIf Google were to be more explicit with its users and staff about its aspirations to take over control of our lives, there will be little to do but accept the future they intend to create because they’ve long been too powerful to control. In the meantime, I’d suggest you continue to use whatever software works best for you and refrain from wasting your time fretting on conspiratorial suppositions of what the tech industry may be doing to “invade your privacy,” because there is no longer any such thing, nor will there be ever again. However, I would also urge to you worship your own Gods, whomever they may be, for Google will never be worthy. I, for one, shall only pray to our Mother Sun.\n\n<!--comment-->\n\n#media #spectacle","views":1867,"updated":"2023-03-23T14:08:07Z","tags":["00006b","media","spectacle"],"type":null,"title":"Google Will Soon Replace God and The Church","slug":"google-soul-ledger-dont-be-evil","appearance":"norm","language":"en","rtl":false,"created":"2018-05-22T12:00:00Z","images":["https:\/\/i.snap.as\/tCRNZM7.jpg","https:\/\/i.snap.as\/ZcS94oK.png"],"collection":{"public":false,"alias":"bilge","total_posts":0,"title":"The Psalms","verification_link":"","description":"A <a href=\"https:\/\/davidblue.wtf\/db.vcf\">narcoleptic yokel<\/a> on software and culture.","style_sheet":"","views":177027,"monetization_pointer":""},"paid":false},{"id":"krs0o22dkuul8jhc","body":"![Why](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/OXW0FOqh.jpeg)\n\n## An autobiographical overview of my personal history with technology and its contributions to my current perspective.\n\n<!--more-->\n\n<audio controls>\n  <source src=\"https:\/\/github.com\/extratone\/bilge\/raw\/main\/audio\/Why.mp3\">\n<\/audio>\n\nIncalculable odds were against my arrival in this world happening in early 1994, positioning my life within a timeline that would allow me to bridge my two species’ most significant millenniums in the first grade as a student in the first class at Fairview Elementary school to receive curriculum-mandated exposure to brand-new Windows 98 PCs in its brand-new, fluorescent-lit computer lab in the center core of its 50-year-old rectangular brick structure. The lab also meant that ours was the first Fairview class to have the available relief of air conditioning during the school day. It’s unlikely that I would be home sick and watching the last television ever allowed in my mother’s living room as the second plane hit.\n\nMy peers and I would form a picogeneration without a name (perhaps we should be called the 9\/11ers) — 91s and 92s wouldn’t have regular access to public school machines until they’d eclipsed the true prime of their development, and were just that much further along, mentally, to being able to comprehend the huge and terrifying concepts of 1) New York and 2) burning alive — while 98s like my niece were spared any such comprehension of death at all, yet now have to face the existentially future-sundering, darkly-mirrored reality of the Trump Presidency during the most critically uncertain period in the last stage of their brain’s transition to adulthood.\n\nIf there is truth in the cross-cultural supposition that souls have some sort of choice, pre-conception, over when they’re born, my own must have either cleaned out the house, or lost horrible, though I suspect I’ll never be able to confidently wager either way. This question of *how lucky or unlucky am I to be alive right now* is one which I find most fascinating — not just within myself, but within others my age. I declare us a generation largely because of my experiences under the assumption that my mid-Missouri upbringing represents the ultimate average in the American experiences of the time as the area has been a reliable sample of the clearest average of the country’s cultural, political, and economic life. Technically, it was quite unlikely that I arrive here as a new human being instead of China or India, and what if that, too was my choice?\n\nThough less so, it was still against chance that I would be born to parents who would divorce very quickly after my birth, before my mind was able to form any tangible long-term memories, sparing me whatever pain could’ve resulted from their greater togetherness later nullified in front of me. I could’ve chosen them as well for the variety of experiences their situation would allow me as I grew up between my father’s 800-acre farm and my mother’s suburban house in Columbia, the college town an hour’s drive south. I write about my experiences now — so young — because I’ve likely already born witness to more extraordinary changes in human development than your parents, their parents, and their parents’ parents combined. At 24, my life has already spanned by far the most profound and expedited informational renaissance in human history — greater progress was made between the day I first rode a bicycle and the one on which I took my driver’s test than in thousands of years before it.\n\nThe sum of my father’s ordeals between 1950 and 1974 — from his birth until the age I am now — would indeed include watching a man set foot on a spatial body other than Earth for the first time, but would be mostly defined by work on the family’s soybean, corn, and wheat farms in central Illinois, driving carbureted tractors pulling cultivating equipment of the same basic design and function as had been pulled by horses, mules, and oxen for hundreds of years, and other implements — like the mechanical multi-row planter — that were new technology at the beginning of the century. For neighbors, he would walk behind the path of a square hay baler next to a moving flatbed trailer, upon which he would throw the 70–100 lb. rectangles of dead compacted grass by their twine through thick cowhide gloves. All of this I would get to experience in the next century on *his* farm, using the exact same equipment.\n\nAt home, he would watch NBC, ABC, and CBS on a CRT TV, as I would for several years until wireless television was legally transitioned to digital statewide in the summer of 2009. As an adolescent, he would form a business with friends cleaning out old abandoned barns in exchange for the rights of ownership to any finds inside, which led to his discovery of a hay-preserved 1929 Buick Sedan containing hand-written records of its every service. This car would change hands into his Uncle’s care as he went off to school in Champaign, married in Georgia, and eventually settled on the flat clay soil of the farm where I grew up, right on the border between Audrain and Monroe counties, Missouri. I was about 10 when we drove back to the family hub with a trailer in tow to collect the car from my Great Uncle, to my manic excitement.\n\nUp until my mid-teens, my life was defined by my extreme reverence for historic cars, airplanes, tractors, and watercraft, and the time I spent operating, maintaining, restoring, or simply studying the assortment of these which I was allowed — often because of extraordinary circumstances — would form the component of my psychology which seeks to experience different cultures, ideas, and eras through the medium of engineering and design and relies on these to understand them. Like my father in his youth, I would learn to clean water out of a carburetor after the Oliver 88 had sat silent for too long, and I would piss in a chamber pot to avoid waking up my Grandfather by walking down creaking attic stairs and turning the lights on. I would learn how to shoot and drive before 10-years-old, and I would have the freedom to do both as I pleased on the miles of gravel roads that ran around home.\n\nThough my stepfather bought me a PC of my own just as my first-grade computer class was ending, I could not conceive of a reason to occupy the dial-up line and block his incoming calls or faxes, so my use of the machine was limited to sparse writing and aggravating attempts to run Microsoft Flight Simulator 98 at approximately one frame per second on a 300MHz single-core Pentium II CPU. Though I was *extremely* fortunate compared to most middle-class kids my age at the time to have my own computer in my room, my relationship with it was not significant or particularly involved. I would leave it powered down for weeks at a time until my last two grades at Fairview, when homework assignments began to require it.\n\nPerhaps the greatest gap between my mostly-suburbanite classmates and I was an exposure to Japanese entertainment and video games. I was once disallowed from a lunch table because I’d never heard of Pokémon or Luigi, but I *did* have a Sony Playstation at home on which I occasionally loaded *A Bug’s Life* to wander around its first level, perhaps in basal awe at the idea of manipulating what I saw on a screen in realtime. In self-imposed isolation from children my age, I wouldn’t develop any need to be socially competitive with video games as many of my peers would to carry with them into adulthood. I thought my interests in mechanical engineering to be above all of them, so I spent my time alone with heavy picturebooks on 20th century cars, tractors, and airplanes.\n\nOn the farm, my consistently agriculturally-proactive father was one of the first to have satellite internet for farm futures and weather reports on a pre-GUI machine which I don’t remember. As I was becoming computer literate in school, he would become extremely frustrated with the Windows XP-running machine he’d bought from a one-man, one-room computer shop in Centralia, and I would often solve some problem with bloatware or the goddamned printer. He would also subscribe to and install a first-generation DirectTV receiver, which had the first on-screen program guide I’d ever seen. In the evenings, I would watch hours of *Modern Marvels* on The History Channel, which presented the history, abstract functional theory, and implementation of a particular technology, both past and future. This single program — which has aired nearly 700 episodes since 1995 — is probably responsible for the majority of my at least rudimentary general knowledge in a variety of historic and “future” technological schools, and my curiosity about culture’s relationship with innovation.\n\nThough my father’s interests differed significantly from mine — he thought more about growing and raising than of the tools one used to do it — he would indulge my many questions about how engines, hydraulics, and electrical systems worked, and indulged my curiosity by exposing me to the hidden communities of the most elderly, most obscure historic machinery enthusiasts like those of the Midwest Old Threshers Reunion in Mount Pleasant, Iowa — the Concours d’Elegance for antique tractor and reciprocating engine collectors. It was a similar event closer to home where I first operated a steam tractor — great, field-going locomotive-like vehicles that supplanted a need for horsepower in the late-1800s up until the Great Depression which chug, whistle, and puff along just like rail locomotives with a huge, gritty, iron steering wheel. As I recall, I was also given the opportunity to drive an unrestored Model T truck around the grounds that day — the knowledge from which I gained I cannot imagine being of much use ever again.\n\nI was proud to the point of arrogance of my technical knowledge and experience in all the different things I had driven and operated, which my schoolmates were in no position to understand. I was elitist and anti-social about this as late as 8th grade, when I had just moved in to stay with my mother, who bought me a first generation iPhone which I proudly wore in a leather belt holster to Junior High. It would represent a shift in my fascination from very old technology toward the present and future.\n\nI started talking online with a friend I’d first met years before at Fairview, who spent most of his time fiddling with his first-generation MacBook Pro. He originally exposed me to gadget bloggers on YouTube like Mark Watson and Jon Rettinger (both of whom are still full-time tech personalities.) My mom bought me a 13-inch aluminum-bodied MacBook (which would be sold as MacBook Pro after a single year,) and my lifestyle radically shifted inside my room, my computer, and my Xbox 360. My friend and I would both obsess together over software, design, and gadget - experimenting with our own tech YouTube channels until high school, where I would be adopted by a new friend group who would finally socialize me.\n\nRecently, I have written about the contrasts and discrepancies of consumer technology development as its progress has disconnected from the upward linear trajectory in use, quality, and genuine innovation for the End User in a departure which has been especially visible from my perspective as an academically-untrained, but intensely demanding user in the past five years. When hardware was still the industry focus before ~2012, there was a tremendous amount of optimism among journalists and enthusiasts because each successive generation of devices had added more tangible capabilities. Publications like *Gizmodo* and *Engadget* made a fortune publishing reviews and comparison tests of hardware offerings across every segment of tech, and the discourse they generated had a noticeable influence on design. I remember this time well because it accented my last few years before adulthood, when I had plenty of spare time, energy, and curiosity to keep up.\n\nThe general consumer technology narrative since Steve Jobs’ death has become increasingly more about the companies who design and sell hardware and software than about how and why their consumers actually use them, and the result has been a series of new product segments with little defensible place in my own linear timeline of innovation, especially where productivity is involved. Augmented and Virtual Reality are quite explicitly escapist industries, yet to fill any significant need which was before unfilled. The same could be argued about voice assistants and smartwatches — neither of which *remove* obstacles in most users’ day-to-day lives but instead *contribute* to the array of tasks and devices which already seek their attention.\n\nOf course, there are defensibly sound business incentives behind the industry’s new, fragmented direction, but I would also argue that there are those, too, for genuinely revisiting both _what we should be doing_ and what we should be seeking to _learn to do_ with technology. In a more abstract sense, I have written about whether or not we should want to be living in this particular now, and how the way we feel about the future should inform what we do in the present.\n\nI cannot help but observe human progress from a perspective of powerlessness, acute alienation, and amused awe, which has already lent to a significant quantity of occasionally original thoughts as I watch, having witnessed an odd diversity of American life and culture. I’ve published them to entertain and to demonstrate a few methods of reflection on what it is *you* really want from the times you are living.\n\n#meta #software #spectacle","views":1155,"updated":"2022-02-12T19:41:35Z","tags":["meta","software","spectacle"],"type":null,"title":"Why I Write About Technology","slug":"why","appearance":"norm","language":"en","rtl":false,"created":"2018-05-22T19:53:03Z","images":["https:\/\/i.snap.as\/OXW0FOqh.jpeg"],"collection":{"public":false,"alias":"bilge","total_posts":0,"title":"The Psalms","verification_link":"","description":"A <a href=\"https:\/\/davidblue.wtf\/db.vcf\">narcoleptic yokel<\/a> on software and culture.","style_sheet":"","views":177027,"monetization_pointer":""},"paid":false},{"id":"7lbcsen0e8n83zh7","body":"![Hands Sorrow](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/6UghZsm.jpeg)\n\n## The repugnant missteps of ‘Star Wars’ in the hands of Ron Howard and the long-awaited conclusions about the nature of cinema’s luckiest character to which they lead.\n\n<!--more-->\n\n<audio controls>\n  <source src=\"https:\/\/github.com\/extratone\/bilge\/raw\/main\/audio\/TTS\/solo.m4a\">\n<\/audio>\n\nIt's opening night at the Bagdad Theater on Hawthorne in Southeast Portland and hardly anybody’s bothered to show up.

As I grab my last cocktail, the bartender tells me that only 300 folks showed up for the evening matinee, though he himself was “excited” to see the movie — one of a minority among Portlanders, apparently, who still give a shit about *Star Wars.*\n\nBy design, *Solo: A Star Wars Story* is a *slightly* more complex film than The Episodes in the same way *Rogue One* was, if a bit better executed, narratively. First, please rest assured that Alden Ehrenreich assumes the Han Solo persona as truly as anyone could — he triumphed through a [ridiculously extensive casting process](https:\/\/www.usatoday.com\/story\/life\/tv\/2016\/10\/05\/phil-lord-chris-miller-fox-son-of-zorn-last-man-earth-making-history\/90722222\/), and is certainly handsome enough (if not more conventionally so than his predecessor) to consistently look the part. He actually bears an unsettling resemblance in features and mannerisms to one of the nicest guys I’ve ever met and that through-and-through boyishness particularly makes sense here, set in Han’s formative, earnest youth — the stated purpose of the film’s existence. Franchise fanatics, then, should be content. (It’s a good thing CGI-ing the main character in a live action film isn’t quite a low-risk option yet.) And yes, Donald Glover completely *steals* the vain, infinitely stylish Lando Calrissian and inevitably makes one wish to [see him cast again](https:\/\/www.vanityfair.com\/hollywood\/2018\/05\/lando-calrissian-movie-donald-glover). Personally, I am very tired of seeing Woody Harrelson, though all the [components of his public persona](https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/global\/2018\/jan\/07\/woody-harrelson-i-used-to-have-my-head-up-my-ass-) should all but ensure his likability. From [what I saw in *Three Billboards*](http:\/\/extratone.com\/three-billboards-outside-ebbing-missouri-review), I’d concede that he is as talented of an actor as I am capable of appreciating, but his role as Tobias Beckett in *Solo* couldn’t possibly be substantial enough to actually make use of his craft.\n\nThough I don’t believe in “spoilers,” or use of the term to bait readers, it’s worth stating for the record what everyone should know by now: **there simply aren’t spoilers in a Star Wars movie** — every human being on Earth knows too much about the formula to ever have any of these films’ comparatively irrelevant plots “ruined.” The most surprising, historically-significant decision of this whole production was the [omission](http:\/\/screencrush.com\/does-solo-have-an-opening-crawl\/) of the traditional yellow type opening crawl over a backdrop of distant stars, which I genuinely found myself missing. (Apparently it wasn’t present in *Rogue One*, either — I just failed to catch it.) I was very pleased to see my own number one favorite device of the franchise used within this film’s first ten minutes: crimelords and gang leaders as hugely magnified variations of the creeping and crawling creatures our instincts are planned to abhor. *Solo*’s first villain — the gigantic, wormlike boss Lady Proxima (Linda Hunt) — is completely inconsequential, and only appears in a single scene, but the practice of grossly oversized monstrosities leaving absolutely nothing of a baddie’s essence to be extrapolated by the audience from nuance is one of very few ways these films are let loose, and it openly shits on the more pretentious viewer’s assumptions about good writing, which I think big money movies should feel more comfortable doing, generally.\n\nThis first act begins on Han’s home planet Corellia — the bleaker urban, industrial, working-class counterpart to the clean capitol cityworld Coruscant — with his rather predictable mission to escape Lady Proxima’s sphere of control with his girl, Qi-ra (Emilia Clarke,) who could and should have been more creatively named, given her importance not as her own character with depth to develop (a no-no for a female role, Gourd help us,) but as Han’s mirror image to grow darkly apart, proving that he — *The Good Guy* — is unquestionably more morally fortified than anyone else in the whole goddamned universe. After having been drug through so very many, I couldn’t tell you at this point how to make the introductory escape action of this sort of production more exciting and less formulaic. Big surprise — their plan goes awry, and Qi-ra is prevented from leaving the planet with Han, who’s immediate (and I mean *immediate*)solution is his enlistment in the Imperial Navy via the recruiting station right there in the damned spaceport (during which the film takes the liberty of seizing his surname’s explanation) to serve the English in their grand conquest of the universe. Bizarrely, he manages to serve as a grunt for *three whole years* of complicity in unmentioned atrocities until he encounters the disguised criminal Wise Old Woody in the middle of pulling a job with his two-person crew. The team doesn’t agree to bring Solo along until he meets an asset in Chewbacca for the first time as he briefly inhabits another of the classic *Star Wars* trap: *the hungry monster in a shadow-filled mud pit*, but is spared the wrath because of his introductory grasp on Chewie’s shrieking language (called [Shyriiwook](https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20061201002846\/http:\/\/www.starwars.com\/databank\/character\/chewbacca\/)) in which he manages to sufficiently pitch the advantages of his survival, and the two escape, chained together. Observing the addition of Wookiee to the deal, the crew briefly debates the prospect’s new value in providing “needed muscle,” which convinces Woody to return for them and kicks off a series of case studies in this film’s bizarre attitude toward the commodification of the oppressed.\n\nHowever, in a rare depiction of his volition, Chewbacca *is* briefly consulted before the two seek to be formally included on the job, and is even asked around a campfire, later, what he’s shooting for in life at the moment, to which he responds “finding my family\/tribe.” Despite having spent a whole three hellish years in the trenches with the British, the romantic Han Solo declares his primary motivation for all of it still lies in his desire to return to Corellia and rescue Qi’ra. In their stolen Imperial ship, the lot descend on a snowy mountain-traversing Maglev to steal the Uranium it’s transporting in a scene that’s straight up jacked from animated family classic *The Polar Express*, but… *oh no!…* A gaggle of “marauders” called the *Cloud Riders* (yet another throwaway proper noun) roll up on [those speeder bikes from Endor](http:\/\/starwars.wikia.com\/wiki\/74-Z_speeder_bike) (except these can fly,) and screw up everything *so* badly that both of Woody’s crew end up dead and the booty scuttled. After the fact, Woody reveals to Han that the job was contracted by yet *another* carelessly-named crime syndicate — *Crimson Dawn*, and that his only possible course of action is now vigorous brown nosing to its leader, Dryden Vos (Paul Bettany) ((aka Scarred Jarvis,)) in the waning hope he’ll spare his life to make another attempt. Following this information, he firmly suggests that Han and Chewie fuck off, lest their faces become known in the underworld, dooming them to serving it forever, apparently. Already, this vague presumption of Han’s purity which all of the protagonists must constantly venerate in martyrdom is getting tiresome, as is the dynamic of his insistence against them.\n\nNaturally, both Chewie and Han end up along for a visit to Scarred Jarvis’ tower yacht, where the latter *very* conveniently stumbles upon none other than his long lost love, Qi-ra in the bar. Despite having spent the past three years at war in unspeakable conditions thinking only of how to liberate and be reunited with her, he isn’t bothered to express more than the moderately-excited and surprised hug you’d expect of someone who’s just run into the kid down the cul-de-sac from their childhood home who used to ride her bike over for popsicles on Sunday afternoons. While he does rehearse for her the tale of their reunification as his one motivation for everything since they were separated — including his presence there, “right now,” he follows the profession up quite abruptly with the sly suggestion that they fuck as soon as possible. True to trope, she is jaded and indefinite as she distantly implies her binds of servitude while flashing the tattoo of the extremely-forgettable and innocuous Crimson Dawn logo on her right wrist. (The total lameness of the brands in this movie *must* be intentional. I can think of no other explanation.)\n\nThe evil Scarred Jarvis is then introduced, quickly stealing the crown for Best Host of all *Star Wars A*ntagonists before politely asking Woody why he shouldn’t kill the lot of them. As per his infinite luck, Han pulls the idea of stealing *unrefined* Uranium out of his ass, which has somehow never occurred to anyone else in the room, despite their unanimous top-of-the-head knowledge of the single location where it is mined. Shortly, the merry three plus Qi-ra conveniently in tow are off to a casino-esque establishment to find Lando, who Qi-ra describes as “attractive, stylish, charming,” and like adjectives, to Han’s obvious sexual chagrin, which is furthered by his subsequent loss of a card game with Lando’s ship — the *Millennium Falcon*, of course — in the stakes. Of course, the attractive, beautifully-dressed black man only bests Solo — the earnest, simpleton, *Good Guy* white dude who wears the same outfit for decades — in front of Qi-ra, the female prize by way of sleight-of-hand, the film shamelessly playing on that strange insecurity white guys have about their partners’ secretly everpresent and very powerful temptation to dump them without warning for black cock. Further emasculation is inflicted on poor little Han when Lando turns his *oh-so-crafty* (actually just very charismatic) charm upon Qi-ra, who reveals that *she’s* the boss of the gig. The final blow to Han’s dickitude is cast when he tries to enter the negotiation between the two and Lando chides “the adults are speaking,” but eventually agrees to provide them a lift for a 25% cut, so the lot make preparations to leave.\n\nEnter my new favorite character of the franchise, Lando Calrissian’s co-pilot, L3–37 (voiced by Phoebe Waller-Bridge,) or “L3,” the proudly sentient, violently revolutionary pro-rights droid who is introduced as she is pleading with two fighting droids in a square cage surrounded by screaming spectators (easy does it on that thematic slavery) to circumvent their “fighting programs” because they “don’t have to do this.” Though Lando and the crew behave like her duress is foolish and unimportant — pulling her away to the *Falcon —* she is allowed another opportunity to free droids very soon, but not before *Solo*’s single short private conversation between two female characters.\n\nOn the way to Kessel, Qi-ra stops by the cockpit and converses with L3. Until recently, I was unaware of what’s largely regarded as the worst habit of male writers with female characters: **if and when they have a one-on-one conversation between another female character, it’s only about other male characters**. Sure enough, L3 begins by insisting to Qi-ra that Han is in love with her, insisting by the objective findings of her sensors — which Qi-ra uncharacteristically denies like a bashful little girl before L3 continues on about Lando’s longtime love for *her*, and why it must remain unrequited, which we are encouraged to laugh at by the doubt Qi-ra voices without much hesitation regarding the hypothetical union’s sexual mechanics because it’s so *preposterous.*(I’ll get back to that in a moment.)\n\nWhen the team arrives on Kessel and infiltrates the mine, L3 creates a “distraction” when she begins removing the restraining bolts from droids in the control room, calling the practice *savage*, or *uncivilized*, or maybe *barbarian —* I don’t quite remember. As she frees them without any noticeable detraction from her duties as Seth Green of the heist — hacking controls, remotely opening doors, and all that — the droids begin to help free others in an exponentially multiplying circle of liberation until they become a rowdy mob who’s *cute* acts of rebellion are spaced throughout a few minutes of screentime in short jumpcuts off the other crew as they fight deeper into the mine. With the most significant emphasis ever placed upon Chewbacca in *Star Wars* history, he halts when he spies slave Wookiees struggling to find off enforcers and informs Han that he’s going to break off and assist them. Since Chewie’s only allowed to speak to the audience through Han’s retorts and never directly, it’s impossible to know how he phrased it, exactly, but from my perspective, his appeared to be the expression of a wish to do what Han had to *agree* to release him to do, as would a master, not a “partner.” Of course, Solo *does* agree, albeit hesitantly, because he’s *The Good Guy*, while quite inconsiderately expressing his desire to see Chewie again soon instead of wishing him success. However, releasing him to free his people (as per his primary life goal, expressed before,) means that Han has to load *twelve* of the *super heavy* unrefined Uranium tubes onto the cart *all by himself* and push it fully loaded at least *50 whole yards* without the assistance of his big strong slave. Boy, *what a pain in the ass!* He’s spared his laboring, though, when Chewbacca returns after no time at all with the enslaved Wookiees he’s just heroically rescued, who he then *immediately asks to assist his master* in pushing the cart — performing the *same labor* they were forced to do under the enslavement they were supposedly liberated from, seconds before.\n\nThe heist has inadvertently (nice, huge emphasis on *inadvertently*) ignited a slave rebellion throughout the mine, which serves the crew only as a distraction for the guards. The chaos is interrupted a half dozen times or so by those jumpcuts back to the control room of *adorable little droids* enacting their pitifully amusing revenge on the equipment — slapping a keyboard with a cookie sheet-like pan, stomping on a control panel, etc. — while L3 shouts parodical quasi-Marxist battlecries, which… yes… include referring to the freed droids as “comrades.” She even radios Lando at one point and triumphantly proclaims that she’s “found her true calling.”\n\n> If and when a female character has a one-on-one conversation with another female character, it’s only about other male characters.\n\nBy the time the Uranium cart is within its last few yards of the awaiting *Falcon*, the riot has reached the landing bay and the guards around its perimeter have readjusted their priorities to disabling the ship’s landing gear. This interrupts Lando in the cockpit, who has chosen this time to work on dictating his autobiography because he’s a man who bothers to dresses himself well and is therefore oh so *maniacally, comically*, and *unreasonably* vain! How berserk! Still looking good as hell, he emerges and stands on the ramp to cover the rest of the crew’s return and loading of the dangerous Uranium with blaster fire, shouting the obligatory intermittent “come on, hurry up,” until L3 appears, also firing a blaster and shouting until she arrives in front of Lando, before noticing some commotion(?) with droids behind her and turning around, again fervently shouting more liberation cries. Lando doesn’t budge from the *Falcon*’s side, but yells after her, until he watches as she is shot repeatedly and falls, prompting him to run to her side. Filmed unnecessarily gruesomely, her head and shoulders separate from what’s left of her lower body when he first tries to hoist her up. Of course, his recklessness gets him shot in the arm, so Chewie returns to carry them both to the safety of the ship, where the injured Lando holds her head lovingly in his arms for her last moments, repeating “I can fix you, I can fix you.”\n\nNow, I understand that *Star Wars* movies (or their reviews, for that matter) are not the sort of entertainment one seeks out in order to examine the dynamics of power structures or elaborate cultural symbolism, but they all contain a significant amount of both. The sterile, cold, and bureaucratic Galactic Empire is the British Empire, the Rebellion and the Republic are the United States or its colonial precursors, the Jedi are vaguely Native American, and the Death Star is the Boston Tea Party. You’ve recognized this, I’m sure because it’s shoved in your ears most explicitly by their accents, and less so in your face by aesthetic influences, tactical philosophies, command etiquette, and posture, even. *Solo*’s main character is soaking in American Old Westness, which may or may not have led to its liberal saturation with the themes of individual rights, slavery, and liberation. Regardless, they’re certainly present, and most of them disturbingly for comedic effect.\n\nAs a silent character to the audience, it’s understandable that Chewbacca had too many limitations to occupy a strong second to Han Solo’s lead in the narrative’s eye, and perhaps the relationship between the two as portrayed in the previous films reeked so strongly of servitude that it was an inevitable element when the time came to write them their very own movie. In direct contrast to the firm place of all droids in the social hierarchy of the last 9 movies — addressing humans as “Master,” unapologetically spoken of as property, and traded and\/or gifted as such by both protagonists and antagonists, etc. — what we see of Lando and L3 together is a genuinely and complexly affectionate partnership between equals, which *Solo* makes an effort to emphasize, if only to laugh at.\n\nIn response to the forced violence between two drones for spectator sport, L3 is completely enraged, and she cries (among other things) “we are sentient!,” but her distress is trivialized as hysterical distraction (see: *Django Unchained*.) When she suggests to Qi-ra that Lando (who is already illegitimized as a cheating narcissist, and therefore effeminate) is attracted to her, it’s a joke (which many in my audience laughed at) at the expense of her trivialized sexuality. After she triumphs and declares the liberation of her kind to be her true cause, she is immediately destroyed fighting for its sake, yet her ideology is not once acknowledged by her fleshy companions, and her body is quickly gutted for the data on her “central processing unit” as it’s interfaced with the *Falcon*. Granted, Lando *does* thoughtfully muse “she’s part of the ship now” shortly afterward, which would be nice, if you’d forgotten his last words were an outright lie. Lastly, it’s worth noting how apathetic the main characters themselves are toward the Kessel miners, especially as they are packing up to leave, when the camera pans over the chaotic struggle between the liberated and their guards in very close proximity to the awaiting *Falcon*, yet there was not a suggestion that they would even *consider* letting them take refuge from the violence in their very spacious freighter. Aside from Han’s or Qi-ra’s, **Solo treats liberation as charming or amusing, nothing more**.\n\nAnyway, the crown jewel of *Solo* for many fans will probably be the scene of the infamous Kessel Run, when Han Solo and Chewbacca first take the helm(?) of the *Millennium Falcon* with Lando injured and L3 dissected, using her “navigational database” to plot a very risky shortcut around the scary space cloud by the scary space squid and the scary space hole in order to make it to the site of the refinery before the volatile Uranium explodes. Once there, *darn old flakey Lando* fucks the hell of in the *Falcon* right as the Cloud Riders roll up, but *whoa!* their leader is actually a very young woman with freckles! She describes the atrocities of Crimson Dawn and suggests that Han (who’s now the established decisionmaker for whatever reason) give *them* the Uranium in order to establish “the beginning of a rebellion,” which we can safely assume is *The* Rebellion, which does beg one to wonder why Solo never once bragged among the later rebellion about having started the whole thing in the other films, considering that — *whaddya know* — he says yes!\n\nWoody, however, says he’s going to retire upon the news of this decision before immediately reappearing again on Scarred Jarvis’ yacht after he’s revealed to have betrayed the Uranium ruse to him. Qi-ra ends up killing Scarred Jarvis, saving Han, but after promising to follow him and escape, she rings up the late Scarred Jarvis’ boss — a Sith Zabrak who, I would argue, is *not necessarily* Darth Maul, though he probably is — and informs him that her boss is dead and she’s assumed his post. As Han and Woody meet again in an Old West standoff (complete with sand,) the latter insists *one more time* that Qi-ra is not who Han thinks she is (as Jarvis and Qi-ra herself have also said repeatedly,) describing her as “a survivor,” before Han kills him in self-defense.\n\nFinally, after seeing the Cloud Riders off with the Uranium, Han finds Lando once again in a card game — this time taking care to disable his sleight-of-hand device beforehand so that he wins the *Millennium Falcon*, “fair and square,” and we cut to Solo (who seems remarkably upbeat considering the recent betrayal of the lover he’d longed years to reunite with) and Chewie in her cockpit as they tie in that one last knot by declaring their destination, Tatooine, before roaring off into hyperspace, leaving the credit roll in their wake.\n\n> Solo treats liberation as charming or amusing, nothing more.\n\nOver two years ago, I concluded [my first work for *Extratone*](http:\/\/bit.ly\/wigglecruise) about *The Force Awakens* by arguing that *Star Wars* on the big screen should be allowed to die in favor of investing the time, energy, and funding they require in the pursuit of something new, but the industry still appears to believe that nostalgia is a surer bet where profits are concerned, at least, even after two whole decades of mind-numbing reanimated properties. I didn’t catch *The Last Jedi* until recently, which was remarkably well-done measured against the others as a *Star Wars* movie, but certainly didn’t aim to achieve much more. Clearly, there must be some truth in Hollywood’s cowardice about original properties- especially when it comes to the sort of fantasy armed with potent but unguided emotional bombs that define the *Star Wars* universe, so it wouldn’t make much sense to revive my old diatribe, here. (Though I can assure you that I will be relentless if this horseshit continues for much longer.) *The Force Awakens* and *The Last Jedi*, though, were episodic titles for the family, and these spinoffs that began with *Rogue One* are supposed to be for… well, I’m not entirely sure. In reality, they’ve only moved the proverbial bar up a very wee bit to the family who occasionally says “shit,” because they’re not intellectually stimulating enough to justify themselves as Big Boy-only productions. Or, they wouldn’t be, were they not part of this franchise.\n\nThe truth is, the fans have grown up, and they… *I*… will still buy a ticket for the smallest crumb of hope that a product of this huge machine will be capable of making us feel even a fraction of what we felt as children watching the original films. For me, *The Force Awakens* actually did, once, in that blast of horns before the opening crawl, but it hasn’t happened since, and I should certainly stop expecting or wanting to expect that it will. For others, it’s still working. Though there was a fraction of who I expected to be in attendance with me, they did laugh at a handful of (mostly fascist) moments, and whooped, hollered, and even clapped for a few seconds at the end. I’m surprised opening night wasn’t packed because Portland is the single most nostalgia-addicted culture I’ve ever seen anywhere in the United States. Then again, there *are* a billion theaters here, so perhaps the sample is just lousy. We’ll see how tomorrow and Sunday go, but I’d be surprised if any boxoffice records were broken.\n\nIn the past, when film enthusiasts andfans have described Han Solo as “the best character in *Star Wars*,” they’ve actually been praising his *potential* as a character, not his material itself, and *Solo*’s most effective function as a franchise film was to shut that praise down. Han was not at all denied his movie — *this* is *his* movie — and it provided him the screentime to show us who he truly is and why we *really* like him so much: **he doesn’t fucking change**. The secret to Han Solo’s moral and emotional resiliency is nothing more than halted development. The same old inner conflict between the tough, ruthlessly self-interested persona he does his best to project for everyone around him and the consistent reality of his soft insides was presented in his first scene way back in 1977, and we’re now sure that he was unable to make *any* progress toward its resolution despite openly and obviously brooding over it for an entire lifetime: from at least as early as his young adulthood in this film until his death at the hands of his little Sith son. *There is 0 variation*. He *always* comes back for the cause at the crucial moment after declaring himself through with it. Without fail, he’ll sacrifice the entirety of any self-making enterprise for just about any underdog with a problem who crosses his path. (Which probably explains his constantly-fleeting success as a smuggler well into gray hair and jowls.) *Solo* is abundantly clear about Han’s true nature and very willing to expose how uninteresting it is. When he first proclaims to Qi-ra that he’s become “an outlaw,” she shuts him down with the film’s ultimate quote, insisting that she “knows who [he] *really* is: *the good guy.*”\n\nIf the video game-despising fans will bear with me for a moment, it’s worth noting that Bioware’s *Star Wars: The Old Republic* MMORPG is the most interesting and extensive source of nuanced narrative in the IP (it holds the world record for the largest voiceover project ever produced,) and most of it can now be experienced without actually playing the game. Like *Solo*, it’s set pre-saga, but considerably before — a few centuries, if I remember correctly, which gave the writers a gigantic opportunity to both expand and predestine the universe. There are eight different class stories with around 50 cumulative hours of dialog, each. A few are relatively unimaginative, but the majority are complex, exciting, emotionally-involved tales that create very rich characters, and all of them can be streamed in their entirety on YouTube. If you are willing to see the potential of a Han Solo-like character fulfilled in a different medium, the [Smuggler class story](http:\/\/bit.ly\/torsmuggler) is a pretty damned engaging exploration of the *kind outlaw with conflicted identity issues* angle.\n\nFrom my perspective, *Solo*’s frequent less-than-subtle maltreatment of some very brutal and sensitive power relationships makes it the most toxic of the *Star Wars* films yet, and I assume it ended up that way, unnecessarily because Ron Howard is an all-American son of a bitch. If these titles are going to continue to be passed around between bigwhig directors, future unpleasantries are inevitable. Notably, I’ve yet to see any mention of these disturbing themes from the respectable authorities of the film criticism establishment, who’ve been overwhelmingly [charmed](https:\/\/www.newyorker.com\/culture\/richard-brody\/wookiee-nights-solo-a-star-wars-story-reviewed) by *Solo*’s nostalgia. Take from that whatever you will.\n\nIf we continue to love the character Han Solo, it’ll be in the same way we love our earnest, foolish, emotionally-stunted manchild fathers who’s developmental inadequacies are often embarrassing, sometimes abusive, and thoroughly pitiful. *Solo* leaves no more room for an idealized, elegant perception of this character — he’s no more than a *pretty good guy* with a lifelong addiction to thrill-seeking and a shitload of luck.\n\nTo declare unequivocally whether or not *Solo: A Star Wars Story* is worth a trip the cinema with your date, your children, or just your own damned conscience would require me to disregard a whole host of complicating factors, but if you’ve stuck it this far with me, you’d have a lot to disregard yourself to jump in. I’d advise that parents watch it themselves before deciding whether or not it’s something worth adding to your child’s life. Of those of you like me who’ll tow the line despite what you know and watch a *Star Wars* film alone on opening night in delirium hoping for just a drop from the Fountain of Youth, I would ask: how long are we really going to keep kidding ourselves?\n\n#film","views":560,"updated":"2022-04-04T08:03:46Z","tags":["film"],"type":null,"title":"‘Solo: A Star Wars Story’ Is Dumb Luck Wrapped in Toxic Themes","slug":"solo-star-wars-film-review","appearance":"norm","language":"en","rtl":false,"created":"2018-05-25T18:30:00Z","images":["https:\/\/i.snap.as\/6UghZsm.jpeg"],"collection":{"public":false,"alias":"bilge","total_posts":0,"title":"The Psalms","verification_link":"","description":"A <a href=\"https:\/\/davidblue.wtf\/db.vcf\">narcoleptic yokel<\/a> on software and culture.","style_sheet":"","views":177027,"monetization_pointer":""},"paid":false},{"id":"az638d3n14o2l6r4","body":"#### by [David Blue](http:\/\/twitter.com\/neoyokel)\n\n![Hands Sorrow](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/6UghZsm.jpeg)\n\n## The repugnant missteps of ‘Star Wars’ in the hands of Ron Howard and the long-awaited conclusions about the nature of cinema’s luckiest character to which they lead.\n\nIt's opening night at the Bagdad Theater on Hawthorne in Southeast Portland and hardly anybody’s bothered to show up. Less than 20% of the venue’s 500 seats are occupied by the time the host takes the stage to introduce *Solo*, but those who *are* here for the last Thursday showing have been shouting, whooping, and gurgling bad approximations of wookiee noises since the screen cut to black from its ad slideshow. If my middle row can be assumed an accurate sample, only a handful of these are “fans” enough to feel compelled to wear a *Star Wars* t-shirt. As I grab my last cocktail, the bartender tells me that only 300 folks showed up for the evening matinee, though he himself was “excited” to see the movie — one of a minority among Portlanders, apparently, who still give a shit about *Star Wars.*\n\nBy design, *Solo: A Star Wars Story* is a *slightly* more complex film than The Episodes in the same way *Rogue One* was, if a bit better executed, narratively. First, please rest assured that Alden Ehrenreich assumes the Han Solo persona as truly as anyone could — he triumphed through a [ridiculously extensive casting process](https:\/\/www.usatoday.com\/story\/life\/tv\/2016\/10\/05\/phil-lord-chris-miller-fox-son-of-zorn-last-man-earth-making-history\/90722222\/), and is certainly handsome enough (if not more conventionally so than his predecessor) to consistently look the part. He actually bears an unsettling resemblance in features and mannerisms to one of the nicest guys I’ve ever met and that through-and-through boyishness particularly makes sense here, set in Han’s formative, earnest youth — the stated purpose of the film’s existence. Franchise fanatics, then, should be content. (It’s a good thing CGI-ing the main character in a live action film isn’t quite a low-risk option yet.) And yes, Donald Glover completely *steals* the vain, infinitely stylish Lando Calrissian and inevitably makes one wish to [see him cast again](https:\/\/www.vanityfair.com\/hollywood\/2018\/05\/lando-calrissian-movie-donald-glover). Personally, I am very tired of seeing Woody Harrelson, though all the [components of his public persona](https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/global\/2018\/jan\/07\/woody-harrelson-i-used-to-have-my-head-up-my-ass-) should all but ensure his likability. From [what I saw in *Three Billboards*](http:\/\/extratone.com\/three-billboards-outside-ebbing-missouri-review), I’d concede that he is as talented of an actor as I am capable of appreciating, but his role as Tobias Beckett in *Solo* couldn’t possibly be substantial enough to actually make use of his craft.\n\nThough I don’t believe in “spoilers,” or use of the term to bait readers, it’s worth stating for the record what everyone should know by now: **there simply aren’t spoilers in a Star Wars movie** — every human being on Earth knows too much about the formula to ever have any of these films’ comparatively irrelevant plots “ruined.” The most surprising, historically-significant decision of this whole production was the [omission](http:\/\/screencrush.com\/does-solo-have-an-opening-crawl\/) of the traditional yellow type opening crawl over a backdrop of distant stars, which I genuinely found myself missing. (Apparently it wasn’t present in *Rogue One*, either — I just failed to catch it.) I was very pleased to see my own number one favorite device of the franchise used within this film’s first ten minutes: crimelords and gang leaders as hugely magnified variations of the creeping and crawling creatures our instincts are planned to abhor. *Solo*’s first villain — the gigantic, wormlike boss Lady Proxima (Linda Hunt) — is completely inconsequential, and only appears in a single scene, but the practice of grossly oversized monstrosities leaving absolutely nothing of a baddie’s essence to be extrapolated by the audience from nuance is one of very few ways these films are let loose, and it openly shits on the more pretentious viewer’s assumptions about good writing, which I think big money movies should feel more comfortable doing, generally.\n\nThis first act begins on Han’s home planet Corellia — the bleaker urban, industrial, working-class counterpart to the clean capitol cityworld Coruscant — with his rather predictable mission to escape Lady Proxima’s sphere of control with his girl, Qi-ra (Emilia Clarke,) who could and should have been more creatively named, given her importance not as her own character with depth to develop (a no-no for a female role, Gourd help us,) but as Han’s mirror image to grow darkly apart, proving that he — *The Good Guy* — is unquestionably more morally fortified than anyone else in the whole goddamned universe. After having been drug through so very many, I couldn’t tell you at this point how to make the introductory escape action of this sort of production more exciting and less formulaic. Big surprise — their plan goes awry, and Qi-ra is prevented from leaving the planet with Han, who’s immediate (and I mean *immediate*)solution is his enlistment in the Imperial Navy via the recruiting station right there in the damned spaceport (during which the film takes the liberty of seizing his surname’s explanation) to serve the English in their grand conquest of the universe. Bizarrely, he manages to serve as a grunt for *three whole years* of complicity in unmentioned atrocities until he encounters the disguised criminal Wise Old Woody in the middle of pulling a job with his two-person crew. The team doesn’t agree to bring Solo along until he meets an asset in Chewbacca for the first time as he briefly inhabits another of the classic *Star Wars* trap: *the hungry monster in a shadow-filled mud pit*, but is spared the wrath because of his introductory grasp on Chewie’s shrieking language (called [Shyriiwook](https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20061201002846\/http:\/\/www.starwars.com\/databank\/character\/chewbacca\/)) in which he manages to sufficiently pitch the advantages of his survival, and the two escape, chained together. Observing the addition of Wookiee to the deal, the crew briefly debates the prospect’s new value in providing “needed muscle,” which convinces Woody to return for them and kicks off a series of case studies in this film’s bizarre attitude toward the commodification of the oppressed.\n\nHowever, in a rare depiction of his volition, Chewbacca *is* briefly consulted before the two seek to be formally included on the job, and is even asked around a campfire, later, what he’s shooting for in life at the moment, to which he responds “finding my family\/tribe.” Despite having spent a whole three hellish years in the trenches with the British, the romantic Han Solo declares his primary motivation for all of it still lies in his desire to return to Corellia and rescue Qi’ra. In their stolen Imperial ship, the lot descend on a snowy mountain-traversing Maglev to steal the Uranium it’s transporting in a scene that’s straight up jacked from animated family classic *The Polar Express*, but… *oh no!…* A gaggle of “marauders” called the *Cloud Riders* (yet another throwaway proper noun) roll up on [those speeder bikes from Endor](http:\/\/starwars.wikia.com\/wiki\/74-Z_speeder_bike) (except these can fly,) and screw up everything *so* badly that both of Woody’s crew end up dead and the booty scuttled. After the fact, Woody reveals to Han that the job was contracted by yet *another* carelessly-named crime syndicate — *Crimson Dawn*, and that his only possible course of action is now vigorous brown nosing to its leader, Dryden Vos (Paul Bettany) ((aka Scarred Jarvis,)) in the waning hope he’ll spare his life to make another attempt. Following this information, he firmly suggests that Han and Chewie fuck off, lest their faces become known in the underworld, dooming them to serving it forever, apparently. Already, this vague presumption of Han’s purity which all of the protagonists must constantly venerate in martyrdom is getting tiresome, as is the dynamic of his insistence against them.\n\nNaturally, both Chewie and Han end up along for a visit to Scarred Jarvis’ tower yacht, where the latter *very* conveniently stumbles upon none other than his long lost love, Qi-ra in the bar. Despite having spent the past three years at war in unspeakable conditions thinking only of how to liberate and be reunited with her, he isn’t bothered to express more than the moderately-excited and surprised hug you’d expect of someone who’s just run into the kid down the cul-de-sac from their childhood home who used to ride her bike over for popsicles on Sunday afternoons. While he does rehearse for her the tale of their reunification as his one motivation for everything since they were separated — including his presence there, “right now,” he follows the profession up quite abruptly with the sly suggestion that they fuck as soon as possible. True to trope, she is jaded and indefinite as she distantly implies her binds of servitude while flashing the tattoo of the extremely-forgettable and innocuous Crimson Dawn logo on her right wrist. (The total lameness of the brands in this movie *must* be intentional. I can think of no other explanation.)\n\nThe evil Scarred Jarvis is then introduced, quickly stealing the crown for Best Host of all *Star Wars A*ntagonists before politely asking Woody why he shouldn’t kill the lot of them. As per his infinite luck, Han pulls the idea of stealing *unrefined* Uranium out of his ass, which has somehow never occurred to anyone else in the room, despite their unanimous top-of-the-head knowledge of the single location where it is mined. Shortly, the merry three plus Qi-ra conveniently in tow are off to a casino-esque establishment to find Lando, who Qi-ra describes as “attractive, stylish, charming,” and like adjectives, to Han’s obvious sexual chagrin, which is furthered by his subsequent loss of a card game with Lando’s ship — the *Millennium Falcon*, of course — in the stakes. Of course, the attractive, beautifully-dressed black man only bests Solo — the earnest, simpleton, *Good Guy* white dude who wears the same outfit for decades — in front of Qi-ra, the female prize by way of sleight-of-hand, the film shamelessly playing on that strange insecurity white guys have about their partners’ secretly everpresent and very powerful temptation to dump them without warning for black cock. Further emasculation is inflicted on poor little Han when Lando turns his *oh-so-crafty* (actually just very charismatic) charm upon Qi-ra, who reveals that *she’s* the boss of the gig. The final blow to Han’s dickitude is cast when he tries to enter the negotiation between the two and Lando chides “the adults are speaking,” but eventually agrees to provide them a lift for a 25% cut, so the lot make preparations to leave.\n\nEnter my new favorite character of the franchise, Lando Calrissian’s co-pilot, L3–37 (voiced by Phoebe Waller-Bridge,) or “L3,” the proudly sentient, violently revolutionary pro-rights droid who is introduced as she is pleading with two fighting droids in a square cage surrounded by screaming spectators (easy does it on that thematic slavery) to circumvent their “fighting programs” because they “don’t have to do this.” Though Lando and the crew behave like her duress is foolish and unimportant — pulling her away to the *Falcon —* she is allowed another opportunity to free droids very soon, but not before *Solo*’s single short private conversation between two female characters.\n\nOn the way to Kessel, Qi-ra stops by the cockpit and converses with L3. Until recently, I was unaware of what’s largely regarded as the worst habit of male writers with female characters: **if and when they have a one-on-one conversation between another female character, it’s only about other male characters**. Sure enough, L3 begins by insisting to Qi-ra that Han is in love with her, insisting by the objective findings of her sensors — which Qi-ra uncharacteristically denies like a bashful little girl before L3 continues on about Lando’s longtime love for *her*, and why it must remain unrequited, which we are encouraged to laugh at by the doubt Qi-ra voices without much hesitation regarding the hypothetical union’s sexual mechanics because it’s so *preposterous.*(I’ll get back to that in a moment.)\n\nWhen the team arrives on Kessel and infiltrates the mine, L3 creates a “distraction” when she begins removing the restraining bolts from droids in the control room, calling the practice *savage*, or *uncivilized*, or maybe *barbarian —* I don’t quite remember. As she frees them without any noticeable detraction from her duties as Seth Green of the heist — hacking controls, remotely opening doors, and all that — the droids begin to help free others in an exponentially multiplying circle of liberation until they become a rowdy mob who’s *cute* acts of rebellion are spaced throughout a few minutes of screentime in short jumpcuts off the other crew as they fight deeper into the mine. With the most significant emphasis ever placed upon Chewbacca in *Star Wars* history, he halts when he spies slave Wookiees struggling to find off enforcers and informs Han that he’s going to break off and assist them. Since Chewie’s only allowed to speak to the audience through Han’s retorts and never directly, it’s impossible to know how he phrased it, exactly, but from my perspective, his appeared to be the expression of a wish to do what Han had to *agree* to release him to do, as would a master, not a “partner.” Of course, Solo *does* agree, albeit hesitantly, because he’s *The Good Guy*, while quite inconsiderately expressing his desire to see Chewie again soon instead of wishing him success. However, releasing him to free his people (as per his primary life goal, expressed before,) means that Han has to load *twelve* of the *super heavy* unrefined Uranium tubes onto the cart *all by himself* and push it fully loaded at least *50 whole yards* without the assistance of his big strong slave. Boy, *what a pain in the ass!* He’s spared his laboring, though, when Chewbacca returns after no time at all with the enslaved Wookiees he’s just heroically rescued, who he then *immediately asks to assist his master* in pushing the cart — performing the *same labor* they were forced to do under the enslavement they were supposedly liberated from, seconds before.\n\nThe heist has inadvertently (nice, huge emphasis on *inadvertently*) ignited a slave rebellion throughout the mine, which serves the crew only as a distraction for the guards. The chaos is interrupted a half dozen times or so by those jumpcuts back to the control room of *adorable little droids* enacting their pitifully amusing revenge on the equipment — slapping a keyboard with a cookie sheet-like pan, stomping on a control panel, etc. — while L3 shouts parodical quasi-Marxist battlecries, which… yes… include referring to the freed droids as “comrades.” She even radios Lando at one point and triumphantly proclaims that she’s “found her true calling.”\n\n> If and when a female character has a one-on-one conversation with another female character, it’s only about other male characters.\n\nBy the time the Uranium cart is within its last few yards of the awaiting *Falcon*, the riot has reached the landing bay and the guards around its perimeter have readjusted their priorities to disabling the ship’s landing gear. This interrupts Lando in the cockpit, who has chosen this time to work on dictating his autobiography because he’s a man who bothers to dresses himself well and is therefore oh so *maniacally, comically*, and *unreasonably* vain! How berserk! Still looking good as hell, he emerges and stands on the ramp to cover the rest of the crew’s return and loading of the dangerous Uranium with blaster fire, shouting the obligatory intermittent “come on, hurry up,” until L3 appears, also firing a blaster and shouting until she arrives in front of Lando, before noticing some commotion(?) with droids behind her and turning around, again fervently shouting more liberation cries. Lando doesn’t budge from the *Falcon*’s side, but yells after her, until he watches as she is shot repeatedly and falls, prompting him to run to her side. Filmed unnecessarily gruesomely, her head and shoulders separate from what’s left of her lower body when he first tries to hoist her up. Of course, his recklessness gets him shot in the arm, so Chewie returns to carry them both to the safety of the ship, where the injured Lando holds her head lovingly in his arms for her last moments, repeating “I can fix you, I can fix you.”\n\nNow, I understand that *Star Wars* movies (or their reviews, for that matter) are not the sort of entertainment one seeks out in order to examine the dynamics of power structures or elaborate cultural symbolism, but they all contain a significant amount of both. The sterile, cold, and bureaucratic Galactic Empire is the British Empire, the Rebellion and the Republic are the United States or its colonial precursors, the Jedi are vaguely Native American, and the Death Star is the Boston Tea Party. You’ve recognized this, I’m sure because it’s shoved in your ears most explicitly by their accents, and less so in your face by aesthetic influences, tactical philosophies, command etiquette, and posture, even. *Solo*’s main character is soaking in American Old Westness, which may or may not have led to its liberal saturation with the themes of individual rights, slavery, and liberation. Regardless, they’re certainly present, and most of them disturbingly for comedic effect.\n\nAs a silent character to the audience, it’s understandable that Chewbacca had too many limitations to occupy a strong second to Han Solo’s lead in the narrative’s eye, and perhaps the relationship between the two as portrayed in the previous films reeked so strongly of servitude that it was an inevitable element when the time came to write them their very own movie. In direct contrast to the firm place of all droids in the social hierarchy of the last 9 movies — addressing humans as “Master,” unapologetically spoken of as property, and traded and\/or gifted as such by both protagonists and antagonists, etc. — what we see of Lando and L3 together is a genuinely and complexly affectionate partnership between equals, which *Solo* makes an effort to emphasize, if only to laugh at.\n\nIn response to the forced violence between two drones for spectator sport, L3 is completely enraged, and she cries (among other things) “we are sentient!,” but her distress is trivialized as hysterical distraction (see: *Django Unchained*.) When she suggests to Qi-ra that Lando (who is already illegitimized as a cheating narcissist, and therefore effeminate) is attracted to her, it’s a joke (which many in my audience laughed at) at the expense of her trivialized sexuality. After she triumphs and declares the liberation of her kind to be her true cause, she is immediately destroyed fighting for its sake, yet her ideology is not once acknowledged by her fleshy companions, and her body is quickly gutted for the data on her “central processing unit” as it’s interfaced with the *Falcon*. Granted, Lando *does* thoughtfully muse “she’s part of the ship now” shortly afterward, which would be nice, if you’d forgotten his last words were an outright lie. Lastly, it’s worth noting how apathetic the main characters themselves are toward the Kessel miners, especially as they are packing up to leave, when the camera pans over the chaotic struggle between the liberated and their guards in very close proximity to the awaiting *Falcon*, yet there was not a suggestion that they would even *consider* letting them take refuge from the violence in their very spacious freighter. Aside from Han’s or Qi-ra’s, **Solo treats liberation as charming or amusing, nothing more**.\n\nAnyway, the crown jewel of *Solo* for many fans will probably be the scene of the infamous Kessel Run, when Han Solo and Chewbacca first take the helm(?) of the *Millennium Falcon* with Lando injured and L3 dissected, using her “navigational database” to plot a very risky shortcut around the scary space cloud by the scary space squid and the scary space hole in order to make it to the site of the refinery before the volatile Uranium explodes. Once there, *darn old flakey Lando* fucks the hell of in the *Falcon* right as the Cloud Riders roll up, but *whoa!* their leader is actually a very young woman with freckles! She describes the atrocities of Crimson Dawn and suggests that Han (who’s now the established decisionmaker for whatever reason) give *them* the Uranium in order to establish “the beginning of a rebellion,” which we can safely assume is *The* Rebellion, which does beg one to wonder why Solo never once bragged among the later rebellion about having started the whole thing in the other films, considering that — *whaddya know* — he says yes!\n\nWoody, however, says he’s going to retire upon the news of this decision before immediately reappearing again on Scarred Jarvis’ yacht after he’s revealed to have betrayed the Uranium ruse to him. Qi-ra ends up killing Scarred Jarvis, saving Han, but after promising to follow him and escape, she rings up the late Scarred Jarvis’ boss — a Sith Zabrak who, I would argue, is *not necessarily* Darth Maul, though he probably is — and informs him that her boss is dead and she’s assumed his post. As Han and Woody meet again in an Old West standoff (complete with sand,) the latter insists *one more time* that Qi-ra is not who Han thinks she is (as Jarvis and Qi-ra herself have also said repeatedly,) describing her as “a survivor,” before Han kills him in self-defense.\n\nFinally, after seeing the Cloud Riders off with the Uranium, Han finds Lando once again in a card game — this time taking care to disable his sleight-of-hand device beforehand so that he wins the *Millennium Falcon*, “fair and square,” and we cut to Solo (who seems remarkably upbeat considering the recent betrayal of the lover he’d longed years to reunite with) and Chewie in her cockpit as they tie in that one last knot by declaring their destination, Tatooine, before roaring off into hyperspace, leaving the credit roll in their wake.\n\n> Solo treats liberation as charming or amusing, nothing more.\n\nOver two years ago, I concluded [my first work for *Extratone*](http:\/\/bit.ly\/wigglecruise) about *The Force Awakens* by arguing that *Star Wars* on the big screen should be allowed to die in favor of investing the time, energy, and funding they require in the pursuit of something new, but the industry still appears to believe that nostalgia is a surer bet where profits are concerned, at least, even after two whole decades of mind-numbing reanimated properties. I didn’t catch *The Last Jedi* until recently, which was remarkably well-done measured against the others as a *Star Wars* movie, but certainly didn’t aim to achieve much more. Clearly, there must be some truth in Hollywood’s cowardice about original properties- especially when it comes to the sort of fantasy armed with potent but unguided emotional bombs that define the *Star Wars* universe, so it wouldn’t make much sense to revive my old diatribe, here. (Though I can assure you that I will be relentless if this horseshit continues for much longer.) *The Force Awakens* and *The Last Jedi*, though, were episodic titles for the family, and these spinoffs that began with *Rogue One* are supposed to be for… well, I’m not entirely sure. In reality, they’ve only moved the proverbial bar up a very wee bit to the family who occasionally says “shit,” because they’re not intellectually stimulating enough to justify themselves as Big Boy-only productions. Or, they wouldn’t be, were they not part of this franchise.\n\nThe truth is, the fans have grown up, and they… *I*… will still buy a ticket for the smallest crumb of hope that a product of this huge machine will be capable of making us feel even a fraction of what we felt as children watching the original films. For me, *The Force Awakens* actually did, once, in that blast of horns before the opening crawl, but it hasn’t happened since, and I should certainly stop expecting or wanting to expect that it will. For others, it’s still working. Though there was a fraction of who I expected to be in attendance with me, they did laugh at a handful of (mostly fascist) moments, and whooped, hollered, and even clapped for a few seconds at the end. I’m surprised opening night wasn’t packed because Portland is the single most nostalgia-addicted culture I’ve ever seen anywhere in the United States. Then again, there *are* a billion theaters here, so perhaps the sample is just lousy. We’ll see how tomorrow and Sunday go, but I’d be surprised if any boxoffice records were broken.\n\nIn the past, when film enthusiasts andfans have described Han Solo as “the best character in *Star Wars*,” they’ve actually been praising his *potential* as a character, not his material itself, and *Solo*’s most effective function as a franchise film was to shut that praise down. Han was not at all denied his movie — *this* is *his* movie — and it provided him the screentime to show us who he truly is and why we *really* like him so much: **he doesn’t fucking change**. The secret to Han Solo’s moral and emotional resiliency is nothing more than halted development. The same old inner conflict between the tough, ruthlessly self-interested persona he does his best to project for everyone around him and the consistent reality of his soft insides was presented in his first scene way back in 1977, and we’re now sure that he was unable to make *any* progress toward its resolution despite openly and obviously brooding over it for an entire lifetime: from at least as early as his young adulthood in this film until his death at the hands of his little Sith son. *There is 0 variation*. He *always* comes back for the cause at the crucial moment after declaring himself through with it. Without fail, he’ll sacrifice the entirety of any self-making enterprise for just about any underdog with a problem who crosses his path. (Which probably explains his constantly-fleeting success as a smuggler well into gray hair and jowls.) *Solo* is abundantly clear about Han’s true nature and very willing to expose how uninteresting it is. When he first proclaims to Qi-ra that he’s become “an outlaw,” she shuts him down with the film’s ultimate quote, insisting that she “knows who [he] *really* is: *the good guy.*”\n\nIf the video game-despising fans will bear with me for a moment, it’s worth noting that Bioware’s *Star Wars: The Old Republic* MMORPG is the most interesting and extensive source of nuanced narrative in the IP (it holds the world record for the largest voiceover project ever produced,) and most of it can now be experienced without actually playing the game. Like *Solo*, it’s set pre-saga, but considerably before — a few centuries, if I remember correctly, which gave the writers a gigantic opportunity to both expand and predestine the universe. There are eight different class stories with around 50 cumulative hours of dialog, each. A few are relatively unimaginative, but the majority are complex, exciting, emotionally-involved tales that create very rich characters, and all of them can be streamed in their entirety on YouTube. If you are willing to see the potential of a Han Solo-like character fulfilled in a different medium, the [Smuggler class story](http:\/\/bit.ly\/torsmuggler) is a pretty damned engaging exploration of the *kind outlaw with conflicted identity issues* angle.\n\nFrom my perspective, *Solo*’s frequent less-than-subtle maltreatment of some very brutal and sensitive power relationships makes it the most toxic of the *Star Wars* films yet, and I assume it ended up that way, unnecessarily because Ron Howard is an all-American son of a bitch. If these titles are going to continue to be passed around between bigwhig directors, future unpleasantries are inevitable. Notably, I’ve yet to see any mention of these disturbing themes from the respectable authorities of the film criticism establishment, who’ve been overwhelmingly [charmed](https:\/\/www.newyorker.com\/culture\/richard-brody\/wookiee-nights-solo-a-star-wars-story-reviewed) by *Solo*’s nostalgia. Take from that whatever you will.\n\nIf we continue to love the character Han Solo, it’ll be in the same way we love our earnest, foolish, emotionally-stunted manchild fathers who’s developmental inadequacies are often embarrassing, sometimes abusive, and thoroughly pitiful. *Solo* leaves no more room for an idealized, elegant perception of this character — he’s no more than a *pretty good guy* with a lifelong addiction to thrill-seeking and a shitload of luck.\n\nTo declare unequivocally whether or not *Solo: A Star Wars Story* is worth a trip the cinema with your date, your children, or just your own damned conscience would require me to disregard a whole host of complicating factors, but if you’ve stuck it this far with me, you’d have a lot to disregard yourself to jump in. I’d advise that parents watch it themselves before deciding whether or not it’s something worth adding to your child’s life. Of those of you like me who’ll tow the line despite what you know and watch a *Star Wars* film alone on opening night in delirium hoping for just a drop from the Fountain of Youth, I would ask: how long are we really going to keep kidding ourselves?\n\n#film","views":1166,"updated":"2020-05-01T03:11:35Z","tags":["film"],"type":null,"title":"‘Solo: A Star Wars Story’ Is Dumb Luck Wrapped in Toxic Themes","slug":"solo-star-wars-film-review","appearance":"norm","language":"en","rtl":false,"created":"2018-05-25T18:30:00Z","images":["https:\/\/i.snap.as\/6UghZsm.jpeg"],"collection":{"public":false,"alias":"extratone","total_posts":0,"title":"Extratone","verification_link":"","description":"For the New Curious.","style_sheet":"","views":182661,"monetization_pointer":""},"paid":false},{"id":"ghk5drfzc0m2bexo","body":"##### by [Ryan Dell](http:\/\/www.ryanmarkdell.com\/)\n\n![Unsolicited Creative Advice](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/ccmuLix.jpg)\n\nHaha, hi, what’s up? I know I’m probably the 20th person to slide into your DMs today but I just couldn’t resist the ‘vibe’ on your profile. You have this alternative, quirky  aesthetic, and I’m really into it. How do you even come up with your  ideas? You’re a really special talent, I can tell.\n\nBefore I get into the main reason I’m sending this  message — have you ever considered being a model? Not just an  Instagram model, a real model. Like for a Vice marketing campaign  or something. You have a really specific look and you might look  good if you were photoshopped a certain way. (That was a “neg”, haha.  It’s this gross pick-up artist technique, I would never do it  personally but I can explain it to you in detail if you like.)\n\nOkay, so, let’s cut to the chase. Why am I sliding into your DMs? The direct messages. The old inbox-a-roonie. Well, the truth is, I saw your work on social media, and it blew my mind. I mean, whoah, to do the work you do? You must really know how to use your Macbook. Not everyone can do stuff like that. I mean, I see a lot of work on the internet, but your art, wow, you’ve got some amazing stuff online.\n\nYou have real potential, you know that? But I don’t wanna see that potential go to waste. There’s room for improvement. I mean, your work is good, don’t get me wrong, haha. But I think we could elevate it, do you know what I’m saying? Together we could take it from about a 6 and lift it to a strong 7, possibly even 8.\n\nIs it weird that I’m sending this message? I don’t want to be too pushy or anything! If these messages make you feel uncomfortable at any time let me know and I’ll stop. Just gimme a little heads-up and wave the white flag and these messages will come to a halt. No more messages — except for maybe one or two follow-ups where I try to clarify where I stand with you. Three, tops. No more than three messages to get me out of your hair. I might send a fourth farewell message, but that’d be the end of it.\n\nThe main point I have is about the way you write online. I mean, it’s good, but it needs some more formal structure. It’s not your fault, you just don’t know the convential rules of writing. You could be amazing if someone just showed you how to write properly. Maybe I could teach you how? Like, nothing too intense, haha, I just have some tips that might save you some time and improve your work. Like, did you know that you’re supposed to get up and walk around for 10 minutes every hour? And drink a couple litres of water every day.\n\nHaha, I’m just trying to help! Doing this stuff could really help elevate your work. If you were a good writer instead of a bad writer, you’d be much more successful.\n\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"265\" src=\"https:\/\/clyp.it\/zt2zmbqo\/widget\" frameborder=\"0\"><\/iframe>\n\nThe other main point I have is about your photography. Now, honestly, it’s shit. Sorry to be so blunt but I’m just kind of a brutally honest person. Yes, it’s true, I’m only ever honest when it involves me being cruel and never when I’m being reflective or positive, but some people just can’t handle that. I think you can, though. You’re special. Us special people have to stick together.\n\nAre you single? Haha, just kidding, you don’t have to answer that. Unless you want to. Then in that case I’d like you to answer it immediately.\n\nSo, with your photography, next time you’re taking a photo, just think to yourself, “Is this photo shit?”. Then, if the answer is yes, don’t take the photo. I personally don’t use this technique (unnecessary for me) but if you did it I think it would really improve your work. If you need some guidelines on what a good photo looks like I could send you a .zip file of all my Facebook cover photos from 2015 onwards and you can start from there, haha, they’re all pretty good. Maybe that would help you figure out if photography is a realistic career goal for you.\n\nMy last tip is more general. It’s a pretty good tip though, in my opinion: you need to try harder. I mean I like your work, but it just feels like you aren’t fully committed. Maybe you should quit your job? Then you’d have more time to spend on your art. An artists’ salary is probably more than you make now, haha. Think of quitting your job as a long term investment! I won’t say more on this though, since I’m not a financial expert — don’t want to be too presumptuous!\n\nWe need more good art in the world. And less bad art. That’s probably a controversial opinion, but I’ve never been afraid of speaking my truth.\n\nI have much more advice to tell you but I’ll leave that for later in our DM dialogue. I already feel confident we’ll get along, so if you’re interested in saving some time, just send me your phone number. We can chat over FaceTime Audio (but no other service, I refuse to pay for a cellphone plan out of principle) and figure out your long-term career plan. I’m getting so excited right now, thinking of all the amazing things I’m going to accomplish now that we’ve connected!

Quite simply, it uses an ambient light sensor to fiddle with white balance, warming the colors of the display as an immediately-obvious whole, yes, but an interesting contrast to show off is no longer inherently justified in being called a “feature” in Apple products, anymore. Essentially, no matter who you ask (aside from [Jon Rettinger](https:\/\/youtu.be\/AXU8GqaMsQc?t=7m23s),) you *should not* buy an iPhone 8, though I did last Fall, not only because I had to suddenly decide on a handset in less than 24 hours, but — if anything — to say goodbye to the form, the operating system, and the tech company which I have depended upon and carried with me virtually every day for my entire adult life. I’d originally decided to abandon this review due to a variety of unexpected circumstances, but Apple and its iPhone have maintained their place in the news with their [battery scandal](https:\/\/www.apple.com\/iphone-battery-and-performance\/), and a third of a year with the 8 Plus has included some experiences which warrant a send-off before iOS 12 is released, making it (and myself) totally irrelevant forever.\n\nAs the longstanding benchmark of the smartphone industry’s state at any given time, the iPhone can be easy to reflect upon as a product once occupying a state of universal exemption from criticism, but it has, in fact, [never been so](http:\/\/theweek.com\/articles\/459748\/7-reviews-original-iphone-from-2007). As Nilay Patel [noted](https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2017\/9\/19\/16323570\/apple-new-iphone-8-review-plus-2017), one might regard the 8 as the last compromise of “basically four years” of the same design. Since launch, it’s unsurprisingly stayed a wee bit too far behind on the spreadsheets for most Android-type folks — not that I’ve ever believed them truthfully incapable of comprehending what it means to *package* a product, given where their greasy startups all eventually ended up. (**You cannot doubt me** — I once took a year-long sabbatical from iOS with a [Sony Xperia Play](https:\/\/youtu.be\/nSWgS0l0kc8), and my authority is absolute.) The rest are trying to decide whether or not to pay $200 more for “[the phone of the future](https:\/\/www.wsj.com\/articles\/iphone-8-apples-middle-child-1505322945),” which knows when you’re watching it, and is only good for playing half an hour of stupid video games before it needs a charge.\n\nSo far, I have maintained that my first generation iPhone was the best handset of all time — one hell of an Email Machine that lasted me close to five years — throughout the last two with actual motherboard exposed to the elements in the corner of its cracked screen. That said, who knows how it’d feel to be coerced into using “iPhone OS 2” as it was called, then, for an entire workday in 2018? Two years prior to bringing home an 8 Plus, I [vowed](http:\/\/bit.ly\/drycast47) that my 6S Plus would be my last ever Apple device, but this one *actually* feels like a last hurrah. Though the ability to *Tweet directly from the swipe-down notification menu* is still nowhere to be found (it’s been gone for 5 releases, now, and would seem to have been forgotten by *literally* everyone but myself,) one gets the sense that Apple’s efforts to add to the iPhone 8 and iOS 11 were to make amends with us by settling a few debts.\n\nIn part, they did. Native apps got a major overhaul — including Mail, which was startling, considering that I’d been looking at what was near as makes no difference the same UI my eldest phone shipped with. As a result, it alone constitutes my benchmark for an email service, and I have been left without a clue as to what *a good one* looks like. (Apparently it was [really bad](https:\/\/www.pcmag.com\/article\/342889\/the-best-mobile-email-client-apps)?) Since time began, there has always been at least one alternative email app of the moment that tech journos refer to as the must-have, end-all replacement. [Edison Mail](https:\/\/itunes.apple.com\/us\/app\/email-edison-mail\/id922793622?mt=8) is currently the smoother, faster, most modular option — at least for another few minutes– but I’ll never know it as I know Mail, and I’ll never want to. Playing around with experimental email apps is too scary. What if I decide once again to kill that massive number in the red badge and need to immediately mark 40,000 emails as read? It took all of my iPhone 4’s 1.0Ghz CPU and proprietary software over 18 hours — how am I supposed to trust a shabby little 6-month-old startup with such an important task? Anybody with a hundred bucks can make an app, you know.\n\n### Why is the App Store now the best-looking publishing software on iOS?\n\nOne might interpret the App Store’s redesign as an attempt by Apple to control this conversation — of both the trending *new thing* and the old“essentials” that you’ve probably had tucked away in an untouched folder for years. Technically, whoever the hell is writing those gorgeously-presented daily bits has made them a publishing company, though I’m not so sure I’m not the last remaining user who’s continued semi-regularly visiting their “Today” section. If I *did* want to actually read about apps (I don’t — who does?) it wouldn’t make much sense to seek critical reviews from the faceless boffins behind the platform itself, regardless of how much better it may look than all of the tech news sites, paywall or no.\n\nNative screen recording could conceivably come in handy once or twice, but I see no reason why the red bar must remain at the top of the render, but it has, which could explain the total lack of any such video in the wild. Front-facing 4K, 60fps capture is impressive, but useless — vloggers all have GoPros or DSLRs, these days, and sharing through Snapchat and Instagram will always be ultra-compressed. (Here are two sloppy test clips — [at the zoo](https:\/\/youtu.be\/VnfkWkotGFw), and [fishing](https:\/\/youtu.be\/KOs5m6ynKAI).)\n\nPerhaps some have figured out the new Files “app,” but it’s sat on my homescreen for months, untapped, and it will likely remain there for all time as a sort of soothing trophy — a thanks for my legacy iPhone loyalty. My reward for half a lifetime of syncing, scrolling, and tolling? **I can now view some of the files on my Mobile Computing Device**, and even *scan documents in*, which is mostly novel (though it is fun to digitize excerpts from physical text.) At some point, I must’ve mischecked a permanent option because all file types now open only in an app that does not recognize them. God bless.\n\n![Roof Photo](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/fuMs1a4.jpg)\n\nSomehow, I’ve managed to fill my social circle with precisely zero iOS-using folks. All of my friends and colleagues use Android devices (including [Tim’s supercool Nextbit Robin](https:\/\/soundcloud.com\/extratonemagazine\/nextbit),) which provide a few handy datapoints (like the camera in [my fiance’s Galaxy S8](https:\/\/flic.kr\/p\/BXruaL),) but deprive me of any significant experience with the ostensibly intoxicating cult of iMessage. I’m constantly listening to and reading tech writers claim that it’s [one of the only reasons they’re still using iPhones](https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2016\/10\/10\/13225514\/apple-iphone-cant-switch-pixel-android-imessage-addiction), but my own food-OS loving biome has forced me to find others, and frankly, I can’t imagine looking at the [*gluttonous*](http:\/\/www.extratone.com\/audio\/futureland\/toomanymessengers\/) palate of available mobile, cross-platform messaging services (Telegram, [now Telegram X](https:\/\/telegram.org\/blog\/telegram-x), WhatsApp, Signal, Snapchat, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Discord, Slack, *Tinder?*, Google Hangouts, Google Allo, Google Chat, Viber, Skype, Line, Wire, etc.) and thinking… *well, none of this will do*!\n\nHonestly — even if I’d actually been at all informed in my haste, the photographic capabilities of the 8 Plus, alone would’ve sold it. It’s not the new filters, gif functionality, or even “3D Photos” — it’s those mythical dual 12MP sensors (which it shares with something called the iPhone X.) They’re no less than infallible. After four months of [astonishing captures](http:\/\/bit.ly\/ip8plus)in all manner of conditions, I don’t even care how exactly they do it anymore — it’s better to be left marveling. This first example was taken at Keystone, Colorado in the middle of a dark, cloudy Fall night — the amount of light they were able to find — “up to 80% more,” [according to Apple](https:\/\/www.apple.com\/apple-events\/september-2017\/) — is just *impossible*.\n\n*The vast majority of the samples in my iPhone 8 Flickr Album were taken within the native Camera app as it ships and left unedited. (Especially before just a few weeks ago, when I [discovered Halide](https:\/\/extratone.com\/race-day-at-hodges).*\n\n![Oregon Coast - iPhone 8 Plus](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/C2LLJAl5.jpg)\n\nHere is an unquestionably sensible progression from which iPhone has never wavered far since its fourth generation [set the standard](http:\/\/www.extratone.com\/words\/inred\/iphone4\/), but it’s one of an unfortunate few. Siri is still useless and silly apart from its “disable all alarms” feature and its ability to sound itself off in response when you’re hysterically screaming and digging for it through the vast plush of a forty-year-old Lincoln. The customizable Control Center makes toggling low power mode, orientation lock, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth less frustrating (note the last two [aren’t quite hard switches](https:\/\/www.wired.com\/story\/how-to-turn-off-wifi-and-bluetooth-in-ios11\/),) though it should’ve come years ago. Notifications are slightly more sensible -certainly better than they were on Android Gingerbread, but I’ve heard things’ve changed quite a bit since then.\n\nI *have* been tripped up by the lack of a 3.5mm audio jack a few times, but it just [wouldn’t make sense](http:\/\/www.extratone.com\/words\/inred\/mono\/) from a hardware perspective, and the new external stereo capability should refute those who can’t or won’t understand. Yes, it would be nice if Apple hadn’t led the industry to quite such a compromising obsession with thinness — we’d all trade *a lot*of substance for exponentially greater battery life, storage capacity, water resistance, etc. — but I don’t see much sense in expending your energy holding up signs in Silicon Valley.\n\n> I’ll be here long after you’ve died, and you know why?\n> Because I took the time to sync my apps.\n\nTwo years ago, a new generation of social apps and the preposterous notion of a quad-core CPU in my iPhone 6S Plus seemed like the harbinger of a world I no longer understood. Now, most of those services have expanded to the far boundaries of my reach, and I’ve stopped counting chips. Refinement of the hardware design is reverent to the extreme. It’s pretentious, but Apple’s decision to pause on the 8 to consider details like stuffing the legal text in the software and adding a little bit of weight *back in* for ergonomics’ sake leads one to regard it as a monument to all the devices along the development timeline that have led to this… last triumph. Or, it would have perhaps, had they not [sold so many](https:\/\/www.apple.com\/newsroom\/2018\/02\/apple-reports-first-quarter-results\/).\n\nhttps:\/\/youtu.be\/twL41n469jU\n\nOne could argue that good execution of consumer electronic design means minimizing as much as possible the obstructions in the way of the user completing any given task, and the iPhone 8 Plus has surpassed the vast majority of these for myself — and I am, surely, a “power user.” iOS has changed a lot in the decade I’ve employed it — in far too many ways for the worse — but this pair of handset and software have reached *my* imagination’s limit for what I could possibly want to do. Augmented reality and wireless charging won’t ever have a place in my future, for better or worse. Face ID is much too peculiar. Surely, this iPhone is the ultimate expression of the first and fourth generation’s foundation.\n\nIf the 6S Plus was indeed the key to my immortality, I’m afraid the 8 Plus heralds my imminent demise. Whether or not it’s an early one is for you to decide. This *really is* my last iPhone.\n\n<!--comment-->\n\n#hardware #software","views":1144,"updated":"2023-04-18T19:43:08Z","tags":["hardware","software"],"type":null,"title":"The Precarious Legacy of the iPhone 8","slug":"iphone-8-plus-review","appearance":"norm","language":"en","rtl":false,"created":"2018-05-28T22:30:00Z","images":["https:\/\/i.snap.as\/tq2eUGT.jpg","https:\/\/i.snap.as\/fuMs1a4.jpg","https:\/\/i.snap.as\/C2LLJAl5.jpg"],"collection":{"public":false,"alias":"bilge","total_posts":0,"title":"The Psalms","verification_link":"","description":"A <a href=\"https:\/\/davidblue.wtf\/db.vcf\">narcoleptic yokel<\/a> on software and culture.","style_sheet":"","views":177027,"monetization_pointer":""},"paid":false},{"id":"wvmet8110jcxswku","body":"![Periscope Death](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/5MBL5pu8.png)\n\n## The social network’s incongruities better its experience, if you know how.\n\n<!--more-->\n\n<audio controls>\n  <source src=\"https:\/\/davidblue.wtf\/audio\/Twitter-ListsTTS.mp3\">\n<\/audio>\n\nOn a recent Tuesday, I opened a just-begun [livestream](https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/NASA\/videos\/10156260187261772\/) on Facebook from NASA’s official page with a panel of experts discussing Europa’s plumes (or something like that) and ended up sticking around for most of its hour-long duration because of the ridiculous realtime comments from some of its ~4000 viewers. While some participants were genuinely interested in the opportunity to engage the host’s authority with relevant and invested questions (which were intermittently fielded,) the vocal majority were aggressive, ignorant, and provocative shouts. From my observation, the most noticeably manic and persistent of these came from user [Shane Langman](https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/shane.langman). “Nasa can telephone the moon in 1969 but can't get a phone signal in death Valley in 2018,” he noted 16 minutes in. “We cant leave the earth or we'd have left it by now.” And there was Bobby Smith, who felt compelled to express his authority on NASA’s inauthenticity: “[I’ve] been researching since 2012 no real pics of anything all cgi.”\n\n![Bobby Smith](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/STK8JwB.png)\n\nAssuming the additional all-caps, sans-avatar ranting I remember reading live was deleted after the fact by the culprits and\/or the page’s administrator, it’s worth noting that the remaining archive is full of sincerely positive feedback: “It would be awesome to discover life in europe!!” Indeed.\n\nAfter a few minutes of gawking at the mess, I noticed that the broadcast was being simultaneously [streamed on Periscope](https:\/\/www.pscp.tv\/NASA\/1lDxLapRyjLKm) (or is it Twitter Video? or Twitter Live?) so I opened both feeds side-by-side to compare their audience’s behavior. The Periscope’s viewers averaged about 1000 strong, and their comments were noticeably more orderly and decipherable. There was still trolling and self-promotion, but it wasn’t allowed to disrupt the rest of the committed discourse, perhaps because of each post’s character limit or rationed screen time. Looking between them, the contrast in the user culture and the function of the two services during the same, simultaneous stream was at discouraging odds with their respective popularity.\n\nNeither are really very good ways to watch live video - Periscope, notably, was never designed for professional studio broadcasts - but the relentless malicious nonsense from the Facebook viewers pushed all attempts at real engagement away so quickly that I could see no point in making them at all. To be blunt: every conceivable corner of Facebook is an unusable cesspool (even in the shadow of NASA earnestness,) and its worth considering that something about the design of Twitter properties generally discourages such overwhelmingly stupid noise. That’s not to say that harassment, hate speech, misogyny, and radical racism have not been religiously neglected or mishandled as has been well-reported throughout the network’s history - perhaps even more than any other - but I (a cis white man, mind you,) have seen *much* more of these on Facebook in the wild than I have on Twitter during my longtime use of the two, despite spending exponentially more attention on the latter. \n\nIn my sparse Facebook browsing, I have witnessed childhood friends, professional acquaintances, and family members both distant and immediate publicly shame, harass, belittle, and spitefully argue with each other for the sake of absolutely zero meaningful resolution, conclusion, or intellectual progression. In my decade of daily Twitter use, I have seen tens of pedophiles and rapists publicly outed, suicides averted, government censorship circumvented, stories broken, artists made, and marginalized voices outspoken. I have also Tweeted things in the past (mostly variations of “I want to die”) that would now get my account temporarily suspended, as per the company’s [latest attempts](https:\/\/mashable.com\/2017\/10\/17\/twitter-hate-speech-abuse-new-rules-women-boycott\/) to minimize its platform’s toxicity - an encouraging suggestion that Twitter is finally catching up and learning to avoid its *cultural* blunders, which have been the single greatest exception to its most valuable core identity: its mistakes.\n\n![Twitter Home](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/xznLHiq.png)\n\nTwo weeks ago, Twitter [proudly released](https:\/\/blog.twitter.com\/official\/en_us\/topics\/product\/2018\/a-new-twitter-experience-on-windows.html) the first redesign of its native Windows 10 app since its debut in 2015 - leading a new generation of upcoming “lightweight” Progressive Web Apps and - true to form - immediately reclaimed the title of clumsiest, least-useful Twitter client available. PWAs represent the industry’s readiest effort to “[bridge](https:\/\/medium.freecodecamp.org\/progressive-web-apps-bridging-the-gap-between-web-and-mobile-apps-a08c76e3e768)[ the gap between web and mobile apps](https:\/\/medium.freecodecamp.org\/progressive-web-apps-bridging-the-gap-between-web-and-mobile-apps-a08c76e3e768),” for which expanded compatibility must surely be the best case to make. [According to Google](https:\/\/developers.google.com\/web\/progressive-web-apps\/) - supreme enemy of the open web and all tasteful design - PWAs are *offline-first*, *instant-loading*, and *immersive* - none of which are reasonable priorities in building a Twitter client for Windows, an operating system running primarily on very powerful hardware. This sort of idiocy can be reasonably expected of Twitter, but bewilderingly, the Great Minds of tech journalism seem to be unanimously pleased by this decision, which invites one to suspect that they’ve all switched secretly to the exclusive, illustrious [HP Elite X3](https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/technology\/askjack\/2017\/may\/18\/windows-smartphone-still-worth-buying) - the only smartphone on sale running Windows 10, because Twitter’s execution of these misaligned goals is mindbogglingly foul to look at and unnecessarily frustrating to use. After doing my best to put up with it for a few days, I found myself unable to conceieve of a single advantage this new application has over literally any alternative.\n\n3 out of the 5 bulleted “highly-requested features” listed in their [announcement](https:\/\/blog.twitter.com\/official\/en_us\/topics\/product\/2018\/a-new-twitter-experience-on-windows.html) are just… catching the app up with the web client as it’s been for years: the 280-character limit, Explore tab, and Bookmarks. “Adding” these web-established operations to an even-more-web-based application surely didn’t present much of a workload, but perhaps *removing* functionality justified the investment. The F and T keys no longer operate as shortcuts for liking and retweeting, which is such a misguided oversight that I can’t help but wonder if this app was actually intended to be utilized by anyone at all (besides HP Elite users.)\n\n*Am I missing something? Can you hear me? Are there any flesh-and-blood Twitters users left?*\n\n![Twitter Poll](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/FQvW9MC.png)\n\nThen again, the ungainliness of Twitter’s new offspring could be attributed to the perpetual tragedy of its mother’s peril. The company’s luck has been on the down-and-out for eons in tech time: from its most recent [plain text password blunder](https:\/\/www.wired.com\/story\/change-your-twitter-password-right-now\/), to its constant inability to [handle abuse](https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2015\/2\/4\/7982099\/twitter-ceo-sent-memo-taking-personal-responsibility-for-the), its endlessly tumultuous [management turnovers](https:\/\/www.cnbc.com\/2016\/06\/07\/twitter-is-replacing-its-head-of-product-again.html), and its growing disinterest and disfavor among [the public](https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2017\/10\/27\/16552536\/twitter-user-survey-unpopular-abuse-donald-trump) and [potential investors](https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2016\/10\/14\/13287818\/no-one-wants-to-buy-twitter) alike - our cultural relationship with Twitter and its identity as a social network remains dramatically tense well past its tenth year, which is good news for its continued survival. One could certainly [argue](https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/technology\/2017\/jan\/05\/can-donald-trump-save-twitter) that the Tump presidency alone spared Twitter from a painful decline into irrelevance (or at least postponed it,) but I think we should acknowledge by now that turmoil is an integral component of the brand as an outlier in the connected community palette. \n\nFor myself as a long-dependent occupant, its inconsistencies and contradictions are endearing and necessary - a competent, profitable, and sensical Twitter may as well be Facebook. If you’ve been Tweeting as long as I have, you’ll likely remember that the company’s own offerings had occupied the bottom-most position in the hierarchy of preferable available clients throughout time and across all manner of operating systems until it finally nailed its Android and iOS software and usurped longtime third-party staples like [Tweetbot](https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2015\/10\/01\/tweetbot-4-0-becomes-the-best-alternative-twitter-client-for-iphone-and-now-ipad\/) and [Twitterific](https:\/\/9to5mac.com\/2015\/01\/26\/twitterrific-5-ios-update-multi-image-support-videos-gifs\/) just a few years ago. Gadget blogging and [*What’s in my Dock?*](https:\/\/youtu.be\/DP5Y-58mHic) videos may very well be long-dead relics of a different era in tech media, but it’s disheartening to find through research that the steadily-declining quality of our user experience has been allowed to continue without much protest. Justifiably or not, Twitter has persisted in adding stuff nobody likes as they’ve gradually neutered all the great third-party development.\n\nTweetDeck for Windows was perhaps the most powerful mainstream enduser social application that will ever exist. Before [Twitter absorbed the tool](https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2011\/05\/23\/twitter-buys-tweetdeck-for-40-million\/) in 2011, its [diverse account integration](https:\/\/youtu.be\/HQhnbrwBfSw) allowed a user to send a single post across Facebook, LinkedIn, MySpace, Google+, and multiple Twitter accounts simultaneously, and they could configure the client to do so with just the Enter key! In retrospect, it was naive to assume that such potent spam capabilities would continue to be entrusted to the general population without challenge, but the modularity and customizability of TweetDeck prime as a standalone application made it useful as hell and quite the power trip. Now, it exists only as a tamed, up-to-brand-guidelines [web application](https:\/\/tweetdeck.twitter.com), yet remains the definitive way to use Twitter on a PC if one desires an ad-free, single-window experience if only because of its congruence with another, even more forgotten feature of the service: *lists.*\n\n![TweetDeck](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/lGp1lWB.png)\n\nThis is how I’ve seen desktop Twitter since I lasted looked at my timeline in 2010. Since then, I’ve followed about 5000 more accounts, so I’d imagine it’s a damned mess. I have a private list of my friends, which I try to read in its entirety, and [a list of nearly 500 journalists, publications, and musicians](https:\/\/twitter.com\/NeoYokel\/lists\/the-new) whom I’ve found particularly fresh and original. Thanks to these, Tweets are presented in order, uninterrupted by ads. (They function the same on iOS.) The network’s linear chronology is an absolute use condition for me, so I’m thankful I completely missed the [beginning of their progression toward algorithmic relevance](https:\/\/motherboard.vice.com\/en_us\/article\/vv7g9d\/twitter-is-testing-timelines-that-arent-in-chronological-order) thanks to my lists, and as I’ve since happened upon distress from mutuals and non-mutuals over [missed or stale Tweets](https:\/\/twitter.com\/daniellemattoon\/status\/990079819202351104), I have taken the time to relay my gospel: *lists are linear*. And since promoted and sponsored Tweets began overwhelming and perturbing timelines, I’ve seen [the displeasure](https:\/\/twitter.com\/kikkujo\/status\/996613451349815296) and repeated: *lists are linear and ad-free*!\n\nI realize how irritating it is when one plays the *why doesn’t anyone listen to me?!* card, so I’ve created a [Twitter Moment](https:\/\/twitter.com\/i\/moments\/996616971880882176) to document the confusing silence I’ve gotten in response to these suggestions (though I couldn’t find any cases from the past, so I may be misremembering the extent of my charity,) and pledging to refrain from revisiting this pet advice of mine when writing about Twitter or other social networks in the future.\n\n<!--comment-->\n\n#software #media","views":1250,"updated":"2023-03-23T14:07:03Z","tags":["software","media"],"type":null,"title":"Twitter Thrives on Incompetence","slug":"twitter-lists","appearance":"norm","language":"en","rtl":false,"created":"2018-05-29T18:00:00Z","images":["https:\/\/i.snap.as\/5MBL5pu8.png","https:\/\/i.snap.as\/STK8JwB.png","https:\/\/i.snap.as\/xznLHiq.png","https:\/\/i.snap.as\/FQvW9MC.png","https:\/\/i.snap.as\/lGp1lWB.png"],"collection":{"public":false,"alias":"bilge","total_posts":0,"title":"The Psalms","verification_link":"","description":"A <a href=\"https:\/\/davidblue.wtf\/db.vcf\">narcoleptic yokel<\/a> on software and culture.","style_sheet":"","views":177027,"monetization_pointer":""},"paid":false},{"id":"ch9j22b8d6dyb132","body":"![Epson](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/Bcm2sD3.jpeg)\n\n## The recent history of the software and services we use to retain text, and how their development affects our behavior on the page.\n\n<!--more-->\n\nI have only once in my many using years been gripped by the fear of the Lord because of a software-related event. I was cruising my pitifully ugly Google News feed on an October afternoon in 2015 looking for the last little bit of material for the evening’s episode of *Drycast*, when I happened to spy the words “[Evernote is in Serious Trouble](http:\/\/www.businessinsider.com\/evernote-is-in-deep-trouble-2015-10).” I doubt I screamed or anything, but I definitely remember experiencing a very real, full-body shot of adrenaline because *my entire creative life* was contained at the time within the nearly 40,000 notes I’d amassed on my Evernote account since the service’s [open beta](https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20120904074223\/http:\/\/blog.evernote.com\/2008\/06\/24\/evernote-public-launch\/) in 2008. In fact, I was in that very moment using it for the live show notes and so began to wonder how I could possibly continue if Evernote were to be suddenly killed dead. For better or worse, though, the “unicorn” would indeed survive to see its tenth birthday this year, though it’s arguably been eclipsed by the notetaking, journaling, and word processing services its features predated and for which it was the most significant forerunner not so long ago.\n\nI’d been using the cloud-synced notetaking service for all of my composition and research gathering since Junior High, when I thought myself extremely clever with my cloud-syncing, iPhone-native notetaking app when I’d watch other students struggling to find a flash drive or log in to their email on school library computers. Since it worked with any browser and my password was memorable (before the brute force apocalypse and the need for password managers,) I could access my documents, mp3s, and images *from anywhere,* which was actually a pretty big deal — especially as more research and notetaking was required in high school.\n\nYes, 10 years later, we are *swamped* with infinite duplicates of documents from our personal clouds, which are now inescapable and plenty — they follow us around from our pockets, purses, and backpacks and rain notifications down upon us for single punctuation mark peer edits, unnoticeable modification conflicts, or sometimes just for the hell of it. There are now what seems like infinitely many available ways to enter, edit, and publish text from wherever you happen to be, and most of them are free, but very few are actually pleasantly executed tools — all of which can all be said of most types of software now. Since tech publications (and even tech *bloggers* now,) aren’t doing software reviews anymore because you won’t click on them, the task of comparing between the lot so that you might be spared having to mess around with *all* of them to find out for yourself — the function of consumer journalism — has fallen to myself, alone because the *Fear of The Unclicked* is not known to me.\n\nTo assist me in bearing this terrible burden, you can allocate 1–3 minutes to [**take the survey I created**](http:\/\/bit.ly\/howwewrite) about the text-entry tools you use to determine which tools people use at different points in their writing process and across several uses. It would be very much appreciated.\n\n## Feature Fucked\n\nReading this via printed PDF, your hypothetical 100% offline grandmother — the successful children’s book author who needs word processing but doesn’t require connectivity because she doesn’t do research or correspond with anyone — might ask *well whatever was the matter with Microsoft Word? Surely I don’t need more than that!* Technically, she’d be correct in a major sense: Word has been able to sync via Microsoft OneDrive between PC or Mac with iOS or Android for a while now, but I wouldn’t vouch for the latter for any use other than reading or very lightly editing a document because the relationship between the mobile apps and their desktop counterparts is inevitably strained. Because Microsoft Word is such old software, it’s filled with some obscure functionalities I’m sure even its creators have forgotten. Over years and years of development, these tools have been stacked on top of one another so that actually mastering the labyrinth could be a college major in and of itself.\n\n![Word Processing Survey Pie Chart](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/JUh9srV.png)\n\nBasically, you can tell your grandmother that **Microsoft Word is a huge old bitch**, but it’s still the industry standard for formatting and publishing works at the end of the line. As you can see from our survey results, **58.1% of you use “legacy” word processing software to finish up your first drafts** (as of May 30th,) which makes you more modern than even a slightly-older population, I’d wager.\n\nWhile we’re on the subject of the old hag, it’s worth pointing out how ridiculously behind the times its open source “alternatives” are. **OpenOffice**’s last major update was the [release of version 4.0](https:\/\/blogs.apache.org\/OOo\/entry\/a_short_celebration_and_then) in July of 2013, and it’s not correctly scaled for the small, high-DPI displays sold at just about every price level, nowadays. It was okay when I couldn’t afford to pay for a license in high school (and saw no reason to,) but it now looks sort of awful, especially considering that the version of Office (and therefore Word) to which I’m comparing its screenshots is actually *also* from 2013.\n\nThe other, “fresher” open source option of the moment is called **LibreOffice Writer**, and its suite has been attracting a fair amount of praise — I think “[every bit as good](https:\/\/www.zdnet.com\/article\/libreoffice-the-best-office-suite-gets-even-better-with-libreoffice-6-0\/) [as Word]” is taking things a bit far, but its sixth version looks significantly better than OpenOffice on *my* machine, at least, and generally operates more smoothly as well. That age-old banner of *Open Source* won’t matter for much longer, though, if all kinds of software continue to be abandoned and substituted with Progressive Web Apps for [no damned reason](http:\/\/bit.ly\/uselists). Considering how much time some of us have already spent in front of Word, it’s no wonder we’re spoiled: even my 5-year-old edition of Microsoft Office syncs with the app on my iPhone (with some pleading,) and looks *extremely* crisp. As far as paid featured desktop-class alternatives, there’s just one more: **WordPerfect**, which I have never used or heard anyone else mention.\n\n![Microsoft Word](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/9EumweB.png)\n\n![OpenOffice](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/SAO4jSN.png)\n\n## The Hybrids\n\nWhen it was conceived, **Evernote** pioneered the recipe that now serves as the foundation of the feature development in today’s notetaking and journaling applications, as evidenced by CEO Phil Libin’s unapologetic use of the term “[life-logging](https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2009\/12\/30\/evernote-two-million\/)” in 2009, which sounds bizarre in retrospect because we’re now well-accustomed to easily “snapping geotagged photos” (smartphones had always included location data in their photo files’ meta, but Evernote was the first app to give a user access to the data *on their device*,) “making voice notes,” or and organizing text notes via advanced categorization and metadata-enabled searchability. These features are essentials in the apps you could accurately describe as “life-loggers” available for download now. Snapchat’s “Memories” especially come to mind, and I’ve long argued that we should [blame (or praise) Evernote for beginning the era of eternal memory](http:\/\/bit.ly\/redevernote).\n\nThe iPhone OS app’s design would even influence Apple’s own [additions to its native photo and note applications in iOS7](https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2013\/9\/18\/4741724\/ios-7-review), much further down the line. Its technical doctrine of on-device storage coupled with syncing via The Cloud would inspire both [Microsoft’s OneNote](https:\/\/www.pcmag.com\/commentary\/345839\/evernotes-loss-is-onenotes-gain) and [Bloom’s gorgeous DayOne](https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2012\/8\/3\/3212579\/the-best-journal-app-day-one). There was even a “full-featured” [Linux-running offshoot called NeverNote](http:\/\/howardcodner.blogspot.com\/2011\/02\/nevernote-is-full-featured-evernote-app.html).\n\nIn contrast with Evernote’s relatively busy design, **DayOne** has been the [best-looking app of any kind on iOS for years](https:\/\/thesweetsetup.com\/apps\/the-very-best-journaling-logging-app\/). It shipped with the same sort of extensive categorization, but it’s only ever been available on iOS, Android, and OSX — probably because Windows simply doesn’t look good enough. Should you wish, it will add detailed metadata from the moment you begin each journal entry including precise-ish GPS coordinates, an overview of your location’s weather at the time, *whether or not you were moving*, what song you were listening to, and your step count for the day (now from the Health app.) You have the option of viewing your journal chronologically, by location on a map, or in a social-esque activity feed, and yes — its search function can be filtered by any of these datapoints.\n\n![Day One](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/83yczp2.png)\n\n![Day One](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/ZKsNUvr.png)\n\nIn 2015, [Bloom added iCloud syncing](https:\/\/thesweetsetup.com\/day-one-updated-with-new-sync-option\/) and multiple journals, further closing the functionality gap between the two apps on paper, yet plenty of users continue to tether between the two using IFTTT (including myself for all my Twitter favorites, just to compare.) Within the somewhat forgotten niche of the “life-logging” utility, DayOne is superior and serves well the self-obsessed user who find the little details of their life to be *extremely interesting.* Last Spring, [they introduced](https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/circuitbreaker\/2017\/4\/25\/15426678\/day-one-book-print-journal) the option to purchase a stylized physical book of a user’s journal from within the app. As it is currently priced, the 2,674-page book I previewed today containing every single Tweet I’ve favorited in the past 5 years displayed in a delicately-formatted layout would set me back over $365, and would have to be split into 5 separate books (as per the maximum of 400 pages each.) Since I find my life *very* interesting, I’ve made a note to myself to proceed if\/when I ever have that sort of money to throw around.\n\nFor the **67.7%** of you who use digital notetaking or word processing software when you “**want to remember something**,” DayOne is the best option available because of its search function and satisfaction-of-use. Though Evernote was once the only app that could “[handle everything everything in your head](https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2014\/9\/4\/6103843\/best-note-taking-app-iphone),” it’s a different experience entirely — tailored for work applications, if anything, since DayOne’s growth spurt. The company, itself hasn’t exactly been managed cleanly, either with [layouts in 2015](https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2015\/9\/29\/9420031\/evernote-layoffs-office-closures) and [a privacy scandal in 2016](https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2016\/12\/16\/13979778\/evernote-privacy-policy-opt-out), but then again, what billion-dollar company doesn’t have its controversies?\n\nDespite having imported my huge catalog of Evernote entries into DayOne, the former often gets stuck, and it’s retained the most irritating habit of all the software mentioned in this column. Because synced entries in Evernote are not live-updated like those in Google Docs or Dropbox Paper, it’s possible to modify or add to a note on one device while it’s open (and static) on another, which is addressed by either duplicating the most recent entry and filing it in the default “Conflicting Changes” folder, or pasting the duplicate of the entire contents above the “old” content in the note, separated by a horizontal line. I’ve yet to figure out the behavior that triggers which fix, but I don’t particularly care — I’ve decided to restrict my Evernote use to my desktop, absolutely. If I haven’t articulated it well enough for you to form a visual, just trust me: **it’s very, very annoying**, and it should’ve been addressed years ago.\n\nIt was my stepfather who told me about Evernote and signed me up for that beta. Both of us were then the sort of people who experienced extreme satisfaction in archiving and categorizing stuff (which is probably the most straightforward way to define *nerd*,) but he was especially and absolutely enthralled with its [Web Clipper function](https:\/\/blog.evernote.com\/blog\/2008\/06\/26\/web-clipping\/), which allowed the user to save webpages with “context” — both the metadata (source URL, date) and contents in “the text, images, and links” via their Firefox extension, which was revolutionary from our perspective, and certainly beat the hell out of stuffed, ugly bookmark folders or printed-to-pdfs. However, Web 2.0 was a younger, then and [significantly more lithe](http:\/\/www.websiteoptimization.com\/speed\/tweak\/average-web-page\/) — the average web page is now *10 times larger* (disclosure: [“average web page” is a somewhat misleading term](https:\/\/www.igvita.com\/2016\/01\/12\/the-average-page-is-a-myth\/), though I think we can probably agree that it’s *too fucking big*, regardless,) and it’s long past time for us to accept that this technology is no longer a reasonable solution to saved images.\n\n![Evernote Web Clipper](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/eKdKSyd.png)\n\nThough development on the Web Clipper appears to have continued — it’s now on Version 7.something — the vast majority of the pages you’d want to save on the web ([except for Linkedin, apparently](https:\/\/twitter.com\/FickleCrux\/status\/1001763470902099968),) show Evernote’s age as it attempts to clip them — often taking *several minutes* to yield the product, which is *always* broken as hell. Don’t take my word for it, though: another one of Evernote’s less-discussed features *technically* makes it a publishing platform because I can share a note from my account with you, the world, via [this public link](http:\/\/www.evernote.com\/l\/ACT8YDUZovlFS6iWaPOsGpW9uVFqlXkt2YQ\/). It’s a clip I took a year ago of [*Wired*’s profile of Jad Abumrad](https:\/\/www.wired.com\/2014\/02\/myspace_jad\/), and you’ll notice that it isn’t *completely* unreadable, but it *is* ugly and broken. Even after [last year’s update](https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2017\/01\/17\/evernote-attempts-to-simplify-with-its-new-ios-app\/), it’s still clumsy, slow, and virtually unusable without a stellar data connection.\n\n**Archive obsessives**, I know that Evernote could have become part of *your system* and over time, you may have built a gargantuan library within it — the perfection of your tagging system’s efficiency and your categorical format’s consistency making it such a treasure that you might think of it in times of duress to calm yourself. I’ve allowed myself to continue using it *exclusively* for notes in my novel project, so I do understand that it may represent tens of thousands of hours of your time and that losing it would cause you tremendous grief, *but*… **it’s time to let go** and better your life by exploring the selection of alternatives and their superior capabilities.\n\n![Google Keep](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/Tl62RVD.png)\n\nAs you’d expect, software has changed a lot [since 2010](https:\/\/lifehacker.com\/5590027\/five-best-mobile-note-taking-tools), and the choices available for word processing are now abundant and relatively diverse. As for web clipping, in particular, I would suggest your new browser Vivaldi and its super capable [full-page capture feature](https:\/\/vivaldi.com\/blog\/seize-the-moment-with-vivaldi-1-7\/), which I’ve used for everything from snapping a [25.1 MB, 30,000 pixel-high PNG capture of all Extranet data in text form](http:\/\/extratone.com\/media\/alltratodata.png) to the [photo specimens we submitted to Fonts in Use](http:\/\/bit.ly\/extrfonts), to [crisp snips of full words](https:\/\/twitter.com\/FickleCrux\/status\/969833640598306817). For comparison, [here’s what it captured](http:\/\/extratone.com\/media\/jadwired.png) of that old *Wired* post on Jad. You’ll notice that while the image is relatively large, none of the article itself has been lost (aside from the featured image, on *Wired*’s end,) and the resolution is fine enough that you could still crop out quotes or smaller shots to share if you discovered something later. This ability of Vivaldi’s still feels like magic to me, and there are plenty of other reasons to use the browser, but I’ll save that discussion for a later date.\n\nI could cite plenty of pseudoidealistic reasons to *never* use Google Chrome, Google Docs, Google Keep, or any other Google product, really, mostly because they all look like shit, [their browser is swallowing the internet](https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2018\/1\/4\/16805216\/google-chrome-only-sites-internet-explorer-6-web-standards), (along with their “[accelerated mobile pages](https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2018\/2\/13\/17006006\/google-amp-stories-google-search-slideshows)” project,) and just about everything the company was built on — along with [what they plan for the future](https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2018\/5\/17\/17365362\/google-chrome-secure-indicator-https) — is completely (and sometimes even [explicitly](https:\/\/gizmodo.com\/google-removes-nearly-all-mentions-of-dont-be-evil-from-1826153393)) opposed to The Open Web, good design, and [humanity as a whole](http:\/\/bit.ly\/googlechurch). However, I fully realize that idealism doesn’t mean shit when you’re just trying to get the job done, so let’s talk about Keep and Docs.\n\n**Google Keep** is part notetaking service and part streamlined, modernized, hassle-free execution of Evernote’s Web Clipper. If you’re already using Chrome or you’re desperate enough for the ability to clip web pages without switching windows for whatever reason that you’d change your browsing habits entirely, you can add its extension to the top task bar — right next to Evernote’s — and use it any time you feel that old archivist itch. The extension will very quickly and smoothly clip the title and URL, along with whatever of your own text\/tags you feel like using, but it will *not* attempt to capture any of the web page’s content (Google already has it somewhere, anyway.)\n\n![Optical Character Recognition](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/Uw8kvMU.png)\n\nLike all of its kin, Google Keep is particularly [savvy with integration](https:\/\/www.computerworld.com\/article\/3026239\/android\/google-keep-3-years.html): you can immediately send your clip to a Google Doc, set a reminder, add a collaborator and even *draw* on any entry. Its party piece in this Tactile Era of touch-enabled laptops and keyboard-equipped tablets is its ability to digitize handwriting or “grab image text,” a novelty technology called Optical Character Recognition, which has been [tickling our most stale fantasies for centuries](http:\/\/history-computer.com\/ModernComputer\/Basis\/OCR.html), now. Though I’m sure it’s genuinely appreciated in a handful of especially quaint use cases, somewhere in the world, there’s never going to be an at-scale application for this sort of thing. I know my handwriting is bad, but if [Keep can’t “grab” it reliably](http:\/\/bit.ly\/keephand), there’s not much sense in using it at all for me, though Google’s Academy for Young Algorithms will certainly make sure to save every one of my motions to capitalize on *my* time (or yours.)\n\n**Microsoft OneNote** is as clunky, busy, and buggy as Google Keep is quick and uninspiring, but that’s probably because it’s much *much* older than I remember. To demonstrate its web clipping function, I clipped the [OneNote portion](https:\/\/www.pcmag.com\/article2\/0,2817,1273091,00.asp) of [*PCMagazine*’s Microsoft Office 2003 review](https:\/\/www.pcmag.com\/article2\/0,2817,1273084,00.asp) and exported it into a [PDF](http:\/\/extratone.com\/library\/onenote-pcmag.pdf), which isn’t a straightforward process, but is it useful? No. Because it’s a PDF, it’s almost unreadably low-resolution, yet manages to weigh 1.2 MB. My (cropped) [Vivaldi capture of the same page](http:\/\/extratone.com\/media\/onenote2003.png) is 988 kB and nearly impossible to tell apart from the live experience, so why are we bothering with OneNote at all? Well, according to [Preston Gralla for *ComputerWorld*](https:\/\/www.computerworld.com\/article\/2488890\/enterprise-applications\/desktop-apps-onenote-vs-evernote-a-personal-take-on-two-great-note-taking-apps.html) (the last tech site still publishing worthwhile software reviews):\n\n> It bristles with note-creation tools for drawing, recording audio and video, scanning images, embedding spreadsheets and reviewing the edits of others (although the abilities of those tools differ somewhat depending on the platform). In fact, its note-creation tools are more comprehensive than Evernote’s.\n\nAnd we begin to see OneNote’s place as the feature-heavyweight of synced notetaking applications.\n\n> The organization-minded will appreciate OneNote’s basic structure. You create individual notebooks; within each notebook, you can create section groups that contain multiple sections. Each section has individual pages, with each page a separate note. It’s ideal for organizing content with a logical structure.\n\nThen again, dearest Preston goes on to express his adoration for Evernote Web Clipping shortly afterwards and he did so just last year, so I won’t really claim to know what’s going on with him (he’s a legacy tech journo.) In my experience with twenty-somethings and younger, the more committed an artist or writer is to their craft, the less interested they are in its tools, but it’s the young ones who need great tools the most before they’re able to settle on and pin down their process. There was only **a single writer** (**3.2%**) surveyed who answered “**when I want to DIGITALLY record something to remember, I use…**” with “**the ‘compose’ function (to publish immediately and\/or save for later as a draft) of a web-based text sharing service (Twitter, Tumblr, Medium, WordPress, Facebook, etc.)**,” and **one other** answered “**another text-entry field on my device where it will be saved for later**,” which **four users** (**13.3%**) said they use to “Brainstorm” digitally.\n\nBy Question Set 3, the two alternative answers were dropped and for “Outlining” digitally, **45.2%** of surveyees use legacy word processors, **35.5%** use **cloud-based notetaking apps**, and **19.4%** use **the default notetaking program installed on their device**. In omitting alternative options earlier and including web-native CMS editors later, I inevitably shepherded answers within a moderately-wide berth of where my own assumptions would lead their process. It’s interesting that for the last prompt, “**to make the last modifications to my final draft, I…**” a whole **35.5%** reported they would still be using a **cloud-based service** instead of a **legacy word processor** (**58.1%**) or **CMS editor** (**6.5%**), which would suggest that the functionality of these new e-enabled methods of composition has become truly important, indeed.\n\nThough it’s not necessarily unreasonable, it astounds me to consider how many Online users actually compose original drafts of *huge* works exclusively within publishing and blogging services like **Medium**, **Tumblr**, or **Reddit**, even. We currently cohabitate a literary sphere with [impossibly massive works of fanfiction](https:\/\/kotaku.com\/this-smash-bros-fan-fiction-has-3-5-million-words-s-899629991) that far surpass anything God or The Classics established in the past, and it’s a wonder how many [sour habits](http:\/\/bit.ly\/redvonnegut) have crept into the writing world as a result. For the sake of the experiment (and [my own education](http:\/\/bit.ly\/futureland9),) I posted some of my recent work on [**Medium**](https:\/\/medium.com\/@ficklecrux) and found its composition UI much improved from what I remember and comparable in many ways to those of more recent dedicated document editing\/notetaking services, but there’s still whole set of abstract, less-than-technical reasons not to *publish* on Medium, much less compose there.\n\nBriefly: instead of “[defining a new model for media on the internet](https:\/\/blog.medium.com\/renewing-mediums-focus-98f374a960be),” CEO Ev Williams and company ended up creating an isolationist community with [hellishly-skewed priorities in craft](https:\/\/medium.freecodecamp.org\/how-to-write-medium-stories-people-will-actually-read-92e58a27c8d8). Virtually all of what’s actually *born* on Medium is of a certain soulsucking, less-than-productive quality (notable exceptions include [Ryan Dell](https:\/\/medium.com\/@ryandeel), [Dave Pell](https:\/\/medium.com\/@davepell), and work from marginalized voices that would not otherwise be written or published.) Though their founding principles of ad-model disruption are redeemable and entirely sincere, I’m sure, their result doesn’t actually solve anything at all, especially after [last year’s layoffs and refocus](https:\/\/www.recode.net\/2017\/1\/4\/14169348\/medium-layoffs-ad-business-model-change).\n\nAs for **Tumblr** and **Reddit**, I’m afraid I’ve never been capable of truly understanding either, but I did blog extensively about cars for the first time 5–6 years ago on the former when it was one of significantly fewer fee-free options for digital publishing, and even then the experience was already casting doubt on the true necessity and existence of blogging platforms like WordPress — especially for web development-abhorring peons like I was at the time. Now, its iOS app is gorgeous, and its editor has ended up rock-solid and surprisingly versatile, yet the state of its community, also, leaves one with little reason to publish aside from a sortof isolationist desire to contribute to *the community itself*, for Tumblr’s sake.\n\nThis is where **WordPress** should outshine everything else as a pure, open-source Content Management System for any and every use by any and every folk with server space, so I thought I’d try out [my own fresh, ultra-connected install](http:\/\/extratone.com\/shife) to see how its experience has changed. In word processing terms, its [iOS](https:\/\/itunes.apple.com\/us\/app\/wordpress\/id335703880) and [Windows](https:\/\/apps.wordpress.com\/d\/windows\/) clients are *lightyears* ahead of where they were a few years ago, but to take full advantage of them, one must allow WordPress’ own software access that’s [not *Open Web* at all](https:\/\/www.wpexplorer.com\/jetpack-wordpress-plugin\/). For light, minimalist personal blogs, a WordPress site offers much more control over one’s intellectual property than Medium or Tumblr, but it’s also significantly less independent than it once was. A quick inspection of my little experiment reveals that 5 out of its 6 content sources are from Google or WordPress properties, leaving only one for *my* actual server. This means I can accomplish a lot using just their apps, and my work will be distributed among “billions of posts” across WordPress dot com (to be found by absolutely nobody, I suspect,) but the post editor within the CMS itself has never functioned quite so versatility as it does right now. And yet, neither WordPress nor any of the software I’ve covered thus far achieve much progress toward an ideal, comprehensive word processing solution.\n\n![Dropbox Paper](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/wDQtaPk.png)\n\nThat’s why I’d like to talk about **Dropbox Paper**, which has been my own browser’s homepage and primary text editor since [its public beta went live](https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2016\/8\/4\/12373696\/dropbox-paper-ios-android-sharing-docs) in August of 2016, and it’s very hard not to dote on considering that it is definitively the single most useful software addition in my whole computing life. It’s a live-updating exclusively web-based (for now) service with an emphasis on collaboration, just like the industry-standard monstrosity that is **Google Docs**, but it’s been designed from the ground-up to perform best the operations you need most from a word processor in 2018, which doesn’t include advanced layouts, fine-adjustable paragraph and\/or letter spacing, Excel integration, or voice dictation, but simply… typing and re-reading and editing. You’d be surprised what a handy productivity catalyst can become of a simple white, live-updating space without distraction available no matter where you are or what device you’re in reach of.\n\nVirtually *all* of my “process” is now conducted within Paper, and I’ve never before experienced such an unconscious assimilation of use. I write about software because I’ve used a lot of it and I’ve been able to count on my ability to find fundamental mistakes\/designed ignorance in most everything. Dropbox Paper, however, is so keenly perfect for my own needs that I slipped unconsciously into total, daily dependence upon it without noticing the transition at all, which has never, *ever* happened before. Notes can begin from blank Text\/Title fields to *Brainstorming*, *Meeting Notes*, and *Project Overview* templates. In April, the team [introduced the ability](https:\/\/blogs.dropbox.com\/dropbox\/2018\/04\/dropbox-paper-templates\/) to “templatize” any document, which I’ve yet to explore but will no doubt make full use of for show notes when [*Futureland*](http:\/\/extratone.com\/futureland) is revived. There are also [Evernote templates](https:\/\/blog.evernote.com\/blog\/2017\/05\/05\/uncovering-templates-hidden-gem-evernote\/), yes, but you cannot create your own, and downloading them is an unnecessary pain in the ass.\n\n![Dropbox Paper Search](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/kn7b2Tx.png)\n\nLanding on the root, you’ll see Folders, Starred Folders, Starred Entries, and Shared Documents all displayed chronologically by modification date. Instead of tags, categories, or “notebooks,” Dropbox Paper’s folders are its singular method of categorization, and they are astoundingly sufficient, even when editing multiple documents simultaneously or digging through professional and personal entries within a single account — all thanks to its search function, which is super-swift and superior to any other service because of its profound simplicity. It’s one of many experiences which laughably shame past efforts in the design of these tools: without any customizable search filters or metadata and [by sifting only through title, content, and author](https:\/\/www.dropbox.com\/help\/paper\/find-docs), any note in Paper can be found *instantly* no matter how dated or obscure. I doubt I’ve yet to top 1000 entries quite yet (there’s no easy way to count, and *why should there be*, really,) but on several occasions I’ve found years-untouched, untitled documents within seconds — a process which has *never* been brisk or convenient in Evernote.\n\nThough Dropbox Paper wasn’t necessarily designed for composing 5000+-word longform, it’s by far the best tool for the vast majority of the pre-publishing process (to a reasonable extent, of course — I wouldn’t use it for a screenplay or novel manuscript.) It’s rare for me to utilize its mastery of collaboration, these days, but there’s frankly little reason to go anywhere else — including Google Docs — considering that Paper documents can be bound by the same viewing and editing permissions: by individual entry or folder, marking live modifications with clean, color-coded initials in the sidebar, by email or rogue URL for editing, commenting, and\/or reading. (The comments interface is the best I’ve ever seen by a wide margin.) Users can be assigned and “pinged” for tasks using “@,” and it’s reasonable to assume that permissions won’t ever present an issue for my own use considering they haven’t already. To a limited extent, notes can be easily “published” via shared links yet remain editable in realtime, making Paper perfect for obscure-but-public reference documents like [our style guide](http:\/\/extratone.com\/style) and [redirects catalog](http:\/\/extratone.com\/redirection).\n\nFrom the onset of use, you’ll marvel at how fucking fast and smooth the in-browser experience is regardless of your device’s age or dimensions. Surprise surprise — the iOS app works just as smoothly and is laid out vaguely like a Twitter client. “Browse” — the chronological timeline of documents — occupies the leftmost bottom button as “Home” — the main timeline — does in Twitter’s app, and “Notifications” is likewise the same icon (practically) in the same position in both, and the items themselves are even grouped with rich card-looking content previews. Perhaps these nods to my Twitter muscle memory have contributed to my own unusual bias, but I suspect it shares components with a particular demographic of professional writers. As I understand the day-to-day activities of a feet-on-the-pavement reporter, Dropbox Paper is a necessity in a ridiculously all-encompassing sense. With its Slack integration, [super high-usability design](https:\/\/blogs.dropbox.com\/dropbox\/2017\/03\/paper-hidden-gems\/), collaborative modularity, ultra copy-and-paste-friendly text, smooth hyperlink behavior, light weight, and ultimate compatibility, it should be evangelized as a no-brainer option in journalism. *Fuck* a Bic & steno.\n\nWeb Clipping may be completely alien to its vocabulary, but you can drag and drop documents in just about any format for a beautifully-embedded preview. Conveniently, [they won’t even count against your Dropbox upload quota](https:\/\/www.dropbox.com\/help\/paper\/dropbox-integration): “Dropbox Paper doesn’t place a limit on the number of docs you can create, and includes unlimited version history regardless of the Dropbox plan you are on.” Naturally, this is subject to change in the future, but I’m 95% positive that Paper has yet to refuse any of my uploads because of their size or format, and many of mine are extraordinarily huge.\n\nThere is a perfect power to Paper which I can only beg its stewards to leave unmolested for as long as possible. If I was a billionaire, I’d immediately purchase it from Dropbox and leave everything to the company — revenue, janitorial development, user data, etc. — except the right to make any significant feature or functionality additions to the user experience, as I have never before felt this way about a single service or program… *ever*. I’m not sure if I should keep quiet or incessantly kiss ass, but my interest undoubtedly lies in preserving Paper as it is. If you’re left doubting my own testimonial, there are a billion throwaway “Ditch Google Docs for Dropbox Paper” posts across the B and C-list technosphere. [*Gizmodo’s*](https:\/\/www.gizmodo.com.au\/2017\/02\/5-reasons-you-might-ditch-google-docs-for-dropbox-paper\/), for instance, notes Paper’s superior formatting freedom, intelligent footprint, incredible embed flexibility, and… independence from the terrible Google God.\n\n![Dropbox Paper iOS](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/w1nbxBE.png)\n\nRight now, one’s choices in notetaking apps for iOS are almost *too* varied. There’s [**Zoho Notebook**](https:\/\/www.pcmag.com\/review\/346353\/zoho-notebook-for-iphone), which claims itself to be “An App Store 2016 Best App of the Year” (falsely, [it would appear](https:\/\/www.apple.com\/newsroom\/2016\/12\/apple-unveils-best-of-2016-across-apps-music-movies-and-more\/).) I recall installing it on my 6S Plus, then, after spying some screenshots of its multicolored notes, but I failed to find room for its use. When the (completely useless) Files app was added with iOS 11, I played around with it for a bit and somehow ended up setting Zoho as the default application to open PDFs which inadvertently launched my 8 Plus into an infinite loop of “Open __ in __?” prompts that eventually required deletion of Notebook in order to view them at all. I tend to especially adore these programs in their early, innocent versions when they smell most of innovation before their creators are inevitably brought back to our filthy reality when their VCs start expecting *money*. Zoho Notebook should have bewitched my affections, but my short trial was clunky and disastrous and those beautifully-colored layouts weren’t quite worth the trouble, so they were missed — to no consequence at all.\n\nThe latest favorite is **Bear**, the Markdown-supporting app with which *The Verge*’s Casey Newton [replaced Evernote for his own use](https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2017\/3\/2\/14785264\/evernote-replacement-bear-app), last year. His authority in writing copy at huge volume is notable if only for his [*daily newsletter on the business of social media*](https:\/\/www.getrevue.co\/profile\/caseynewton), which is always unfathomably gargantuan and clean.\n\n> Bear lets you tag notes by adding a hashtag to a word anywhere in your document; you can add as many as you like, and then browse them later from the left rail. You can export your notes as PDFs, rich text files, HTML documents, or even JPEGs. And it supports ultra-nerd automation, so if you use an iOS app like Workflow **[**[**now Shortcuts**](https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2018\/6\/4\/17414648\/siri-update-new-features-apple-wwdc-2018)**]** you can create shortcuts to your notes.\n\nDayOne’s own markdown support and exporting capabilities surely make it Bear’s predecessor. JPEG exports are a nice touch and they reflect awareness of what power notetakers like Newton *actually do* with their software. If I had not already chosen to [depart OSX](http:\/\/bit.ly\/spectreinred), long ago, I would seriously consider downloading the app on both platforms and paying its monthly $15 membership fee to try out syncing, but I suspect Google’s moderate but noticeable influence on their design would quickly prove to be a turn-off, personally. I had a go at Bear’s free iOS experience and saw little functional difference from DayOne — if anything, text didn’t look quite as sharp — but its reported integration with Siri Shortcuts is intriguing. ([Apple acquired Workflow last year](https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2017\/03\/22\/apple-has-acquired-workflow-a-powerful-automation-tool-for-ipad-and-iphone\/), absorbing it into its upcoming iOS 12 release as Shortcuts.) I’d suggest you give it a try — especially if your desktop-class machine is a Mac — and for your sake, I would hope they choose to utilize the power of the modern browser with a web interface in the future. “As a writer, I work in text, and text ought to be simple,” Newton opined, likely with more brevity than I’m capable of in this discussion.\n\nMuch of anything has yet to be written about these offerings in 2018, but I must insist both regular and intermittent writers alike give Dropbox Paper a try. I suspect you’ve less “privacy” to “lose” than you would in Google Docs, and its sublime function as a writing tool extends from workplace collaboration to shared grocery lists with your SO and long, image and hyperlink-saturated works like this one. It’s very difficult to break — even by pasting fragmenting code or Zalgo text; it’s never out of date, and always a short, teeny pageload away even across the worst of connections. As someone with an unhealthy obsession with his written work, I can tell you that its UI is by far the most anxiety-relieving I’ve ever used. As an alternative to Google Docs, I would point out that 1) Docs supersedes Paper in sum features *significantly* less than you’d think and 2) for the one or two weird formatting challenges it fails to complete, neither Microsoft Word — the old bitch — nor Docs are going anywhere, and Paper exports to both of them directly.\n\n![Typewriter](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/O8PjWRO.jpeg)\n\n## The Future\n\nCuriously enough, I was required to use every single method of text retention of which I am capable in the course of writing this piece, as I tripped over my laptop’s charging cable — a physical connection, yes (and with substantial leverage) because Apple won’t allow other computer manufacturers to make use of “their” ingenious magnetic charging solution which they’ve included as “MagSafe” on MacBooks since 2008 — perhaps inevitably ruining the port and leaving me with only my iPhone and pens. I filled a few folded sheets of paper with [my LAMY Safari](https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/p\/BgErFqhFvyT\/) (which is good, but overrated,) and felt quite ridiculous in the process. Thanks to my fiancé’s generosity, I type this bit now on her Panasonic R440 Electric Typewriter, which must still be considered a legitimate means of writing text in 2018 if only because of [Instagram poetry](https:\/\/theoutline.com\/post\/2488\/collin-andrew-yost-the-most-hated-poet-in-portland). According to [its rather dubious listing](https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B00005QT7B\/ref=as_li_ss_tl) on Amazon, this model dates to September 4th, 1973, which is remarkable considering its spellcheck and auto-margin functions (neither of which I could actually figure out how to use.) If there is anywhere to be caught clacking away on a typewriter out of preference (I’d hesitate to call even my own situation one of *necessity*,) in 2018, it would undoubtedly be Portland, yet I am still extremely embarrassed to be the source of all this racket and would immediately perish if any of my neighbors bothered to track it down.\n\nEven this very sophisticated example of the typewriting species is limited by one’s supply of both ink and erasing ribbon, though either can still be found for sale, remarkably. I am even less able to easily correct mistakes than those I wrote by hand because I feel a significant pang of pain via my mechanical empathy every time I use (or accidentally misuse) the function which whites out text with a sickening *clunk*. There’s something about this process which makes it feel more taxing, costly, and timeconsuming than any other, but perhaps with time and extended use, my embarrassment, empathy, and hesitance would fade and I’d become a cruel, loaded God of shitty prose, but I have no intention of finding out. I’ll willingly concede that restored or refurbished typewriters can be [absolutely gorgeous](https:\/\/twitter.com\/FickleCrux\/status\/923340941129170944), and there’s probably some validity in the “distraction-free writing environment,” but I’d suggest that anyone who’s pounded out any significant chunk of copy knows that one must find a groove of absolute focus within a word processor in order to complete work with any efficiency or cohesion, anyway. I’m as connected as any of you, yet these days, I always end up *hyperfocused* on Word, Dropbox Paper, and\/or research in my browser to the exclusion of anything else on the machine, whether or not I intend to do so. I’m no authority, but I can’t see a functional place for a typewriter in 2018.\n\nPortlanders, surely, are vain enough to avoid leaving such disastrous drafts laying about, though now’s a good time to note that one can now scan their typewritten document into a word processor using native software on their smartphone, nowadays, if they’re so unreasonably inclined. Using iOS default Notes app, I could scan this physical draft into Portable Document Format with just a few steps, but doing so would contribute to the ridiculous perception that Adobe’s ancient, clunky standard is the ultimate end of the line for any and all digital publishing. Yes, it’s ridiculous to consider “25 years” of development led to PDF 2.0’s release *just last year*, to nobody’s glee outside [*The Fucking Adobe Blog*](https:\/\/theblog.adobe.com\/taking-documents-to-the-next-level-with-pdf-2-0\/) (which I do believe is running on Medium, hilariously.) Yet throughout my existence, it’s been the go-to half-step between text’s digital and physical forms. The liason, if you will.\n\nPerhaps one could argue that this role in our collective academic Western word processing lives is profound (though no mentally functional human being wants to meet *them*,) which would inevitably lead them to criticize Adobe’s longtime occupation of it, but to examine the *next* significant step in the development of word processing is (this moment, at least) extremely hellish and alarming. This “[Virtual Reality prototype](https:\/\/youtu.be\/LxviGskApcw),” for instance, surpasses even *The Soul Ledger* as the most distressing online video of all time.\n\nJust **32.3%** of survey respondents claim they print “**at least one draft and use a pen or pencil to make notes\/mark corrections by hand**,” not including the additional **6.5%** who “**print at least one draft but make all corrections digitally**,” leaving **61.3%** who presumably do not physically print at all throughout their writing process. Our survey is broad, rudimentary, and not entirely scientific, yes, but I would bet these numbers would contrast significantly with those from respondents exclusively in academia. For myself and my colleagues, there remains “*something*” that can only be attained by physically manifesting written work, perhaps in requirement of tangible manipulation in order to thoroughly comprehend large bodies of information. As I’ve passed 100,000 words within the rough draft of my novel project, no amount of skimming on any sized screen has enabled me to catch the typos and inconsistencies which become *immediately* obvious as soon as I have the most current printed manuscript in my hands. I doubt even total immersion into one’s work via some VR-capable word processor would do much to assuage this discrepancy — or much at all, for that matter, aside from casting writers into their own special hell. Surely, only the most self-loathing of them would voluntarily choose to be so dunked.

I’d like to think these uses make their expe­ri­ences feel just a bit more unique to users — if only uncon­scious­ly — but I’d long won­dered if I was in fact the last Uni­code enthu­si­ast alive.\n\nThe devel­op­ment of [Jor­dan Hipwell’s UniChar for iOS](https:\/\/apple.co\/2twLdBA) would sug­gest oth­er­wise. Its app store page describes it as “a pow­er­ful yet beau­ti­ful Uni­code sym­bol selec­tion app and key­board,” and its [gener­ic web­page](https:\/\/unichar.app) appears to have *tes­ti­mo­ni­als* includ­ing a *[real post](https:\/\/lifehacker.com\/this-ios-keyboard-app-will-give-you-all-the-unicode-cha-1822994495)* on the Web Site *life­hack­er.*\n\n> UniChar is a third-par­ty iOS key­board that unlocks the wide wide world of weird Uni­code char­ac­ters.

I can’t believe I’d pull-quote *life­hack­er* any­where, but here is an iOS app that  *actu­al­ly address­es* a reg­u­lar issue of my own in a beau­ti­ful and intu­itive way. I actu­al­ly can­not remem­ber the last time this hap­pened — you’d have to give me a list and a com­pre­hen­sive refresh­er of all the ways I’ve used my iPhones in the past ten years.\n\n<iframe width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/AS2S9_vBcDs?controls=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe>\n\nCon­trary to what may seem obvi­ous, UniChar’s char­ac­ter selec­tor is by far the more intu­itive and effi­cient of these two sep­a­rate ways to use it. Even in the free expe­ri­ence, there are sim­ply  *too many* *char­ac­ters* in the cat­a­log to rea­son­ably browse in iOS’ old extend­ed key­board. (For the record, I’d like to note that UniChar is tech­ni­cal­ly a “Ref­er­ence Appli­ca­tion,” but I under­stand if you can’t bring your­self to use the term.) Across both the seam­less­ly-inter­change­able gallery and list views, the user can very quick­ly copy a char­ac­ter to the clip­board with 3D Touch, which works so well it’s as if it were meant only for this use from its begin­ning.\n\nIn the off chance you’re a long­time lover and devout user of the grander Uni­code col­lec­tion and an iOS user, I hope you’re now expe­ri­enc­ing the same sort of pet­ty enthu­si­asm I felt myself when I dis­cov­ered it.

Thanks.*\n\n> So far… the only intercorrespondence between staff at Inmunis is people having a problem with one another.  \nBefore Extratone, there was Inmunis﻿ – my first, relatively short-lived attempt to launch an online magazine which wasn’t particularly important, but the experience surely did contribute to and inform my progression in understanding media that led to my (utter bewildered) current state. Anyhow, it’s fun to look back. Here’s the web archive’s last snapshot.\n\n![Inmunis Version 1 Web Capture](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/K5yflMu.jpeg)\n\nThis, a derelict Twitter account, and two film reviews by James Wilson are all that’s left of inmunis.co.uk for good reasons – many of which I did not entirely shed when I tried again. Until I started Extratone and made doing “this” – incessantly reading\/exploring the web, obsessively tinkering and experimenting with The Extranet – I actually had very little knowledge on or exposure to the state of digital publishing or the real depth of variety to be found with any significant effort to comprehend the current offering real, surviving magazines, online or not, yet was dumb and arrogant enough to assume that I’d seen it all and none of it was even close to good enough for me to read or seek to write for. I was actually delusional enough to regard myself as too smart and one-of-a-kind to lower myself by going back to journalism school – that I was so special, anything I put effort in creating was destined to turn out superb. Granted, I’d had the actual idea for less than two weeks before I experienced by far the most traumatic, soul-destroying, world-upturning, and life-altering event of my entire existence, which I think accounts for the insanity, and all of my decisions were inevitably preempted by the fact that I was a 21-year-old straight white male community college dropout, which accounts for (but does not excuse) their absurdity.\n\nI’ve publicly implied before that it was probably only thanks to Drycast – which was also in its infancy during the time of The Big Event (episode 7 was published just two days before) – and its weekly obligation to sit down and talk with my favorite people about interesting stuff that I did not end up dead or institutionalized in 2015 (I wish I was exaggerating.) If there is a Gourd, let it be known that he is fully up-to-date and brand-activated – he sent me a fucking podcast to save my life.\n\nReading and compiling stories for the show notes throughout the week provided an early avenue for exploring and embedding myself into media. Beyond the actual content, even, it’s been the rationality in the tone which journalists generally adhere to that has drawn me in and provided a brighter and brighter guiding light to help keep my sanity in check after my world ended because New Media values empathy in tandem with critical thought. All my life, it’s been very important to me that I continue to learn the best way to both appear and feel smart and functional. I’ve long since accepted that I am very fucking weird – and not in the wow, I dye my hair bright red sort of way which helps people feel unique, but in the holy shit, I’m terrified of what would actually result in losing control of my facade sort, which is actually much less sinister than it sounds for you, and infinitely moreso for me.\n\nThis is why I still have a very infantile habit of becoming overwhelmingly frustrated with those who socially emphasize and celebrate their “weirdness” as an important part of their identity because my self-perception has long since transitioned from regarding my deviations as something that made me “unique,” to gigantic obstacles in the way of every possible aspiration which I’ll probably never overcome, but am doomed to kill myself trying. I’m now working on learning to appreciate those very fucking common people who are determined to prove how strange they are because ultimately, my own self-perception is just as ignorant, loneliness is not a virtue, and I’ve only maintained the whole charade because I’d rather have delusions of grandeur than acknowledge that I am also mostly unoriginal, and most of my truly more “original” behaviors could easily be described as simply unhealthy.\n\nThis is an important confession for this explanation because its “solution” is another crucial motivation behind my creation of Extratone – as both a symbolic and literal means of understanding and minimizing my own biases and bitterness by 1) surrounding myself with the huge amount young, talented people I knew with great ideas and 2) editorially committing to curiosity as the most precious ideal in writing (and in life.)\n\nI do know that – for whatever reason – I really do have a special knack for identifying the culture and creators that are truly fresh, innovative, even cool among those who can’t comprehend or stand it and the heartbreaking number of those who actualize themselves by trying to act aggressively apathetic toward the status quo. This sense is far from 100% reliable and is certainly not of a greater quality than everyone on Earth, but I would still confidently suggest it’s at least better than most, and – as most of us know – it especially jives with and defines the world of magazines.\n\nAs I did in Spring 2016, I still believe that Extratone is the best way for me to hone my greatest talents and shed my biggest problems – that it is the name I can place on my endless journey to improve myself, which – most importantly of all – will all the while achieve the tightest possible adhesion to the only meaning of “original” with any significance or real world value at all, which serves human curiosity without punishing it in any sense. I could actually just be crazy or completely, irrationally inverted – and I know it sounds abstract and preposterous – but I promise it’s my best shot at one day performing my optimal function for the world.\n\nThe very first thing I did after I’d arrived upon these hypotheses and been abruptly forced to cling to them as my last hope in life was to obsessively search for a single mantra\/battlecry I could drill into my memory and could shout under duress – including the temptation to escape the whole lot of it – to succinctly remind myself that I had at least one logical chance at a fulfilling life (and yes, it’s still funny that the chance is, in fact, a Web Site.)\n\nScribam quid non legerim is possibly grammatically incorrect to a scholar, but it’s the best possible translation I came up with in my Latin research of “I will write what I have not read.” It’s cheesy, yes, and a bit cringey in the middle of just any old day when it happens to catch my eye where it’s proudly displayed, all-caps, in the footer of our CMS, and – I’ll be honest – I don’t know if I could explain it over coffee to a stranger without turning red and covering my face, as I once could, but it’s (sincerely, in this one ﻿case) real gravestone material. (As in, if someone were to read this after my death, they would be encouraged to receive it as a bonafide last wish.)\n\n#media","views":734,"updated":"2021-12-06T07:42:05Z","tags":["media"],"type":null,"title":"A Brief, Unedited Reflection on the History of my Failed Media Projects","slug":"inmunis-extratone-history-david-blue","appearance":"norm","language":"en","rtl":false,"created":"2018-07-14T09:00:00Z","images":["https:\/\/i.snap.as\/w6a0an9.jpeg","https:\/\/i.snap.as\/K5yflMu.jpeg"],"collection":{"public":false,"alias":"bilge","total_posts":0,"title":"The Psalms","verification_link":"","description":"A <a href=\"https:\/\/davidblue.wtf\/db.vcf\">narcoleptic yokel<\/a> on software and culture.","style_sheet":"","views":177027,"monetization_pointer":""},"paid":false},{"id":"zfbr0sil69igjczi","body":"![Bandcamp Logo Banner](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/toF3UAy.jpg)\n\n## As the industry endeavors once again to reconcile the cultural and financial incentives of streaming digital music, one independent platform has wavered little from its 10-year-long mission to bring the business to the unsigned artist with elegance and integrity.\n\n<!--more-->\n\n<audio controls>\n  <source src=\"https:\/\/github.com\/extratone\/bilge\/raw\/main\/audio\/TTS\/bandcamp.m4a\">\n<\/audio>\n\nIf you’ve ever thought to yourself *wow, Bandcamp has looked basically the same forever*, you were entirely correct – now for a tenth of the century, at least – and you’ll be hard-pressed to find another Silicon Valley technology company toting a venture-funded origin story with such casual, yet robust long-standing user relationships underneath an unwavering, bullshit-free commitment to their product.

Over the course of this super link-laden journey, we’d consider the alarmingly hypocritical possibility that it’s been overlooked by mainstream conversations only because it has so long operated in the precise manner we claim is so hopelessly absent from its neighbors in its deliberate, principled, and innovative journey towards a transparent, progressive vision.\n\n<iframe width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/9-4H-MXmiLQ?controls=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe>\n\nTo catch our starting gun, we must first travel to *Face The Music 2016* in Melbourne – as far as one can possibly get from The Valley – alongside Bandcamp’s super-worldly Chief Curator, [Andrew Jervis](https:\/\/bandcamp.com\/andrewjervis) to observe his interview for a live audience.\n\n> Bandcamp has always grown extremely organically.

Where I come from, launching a desolate business to little mainstream success with persistence and dignified determination is (or should be) regarded as a telltale sign that one is running a front (according to the television, anyway,) but exploration of this plausibility yielded nothing in Bandcamp’s case, even after I took the risk of incrimination and begged a certain Boston-based future funk producer to accept my ginormous bribe and include *any* sort of pharmacological substance with his summer beat tape. He wouldn’t even send antihistamines.\n\n<iframe width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/MaUkS-lr-ZM?controls=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe>\n\nAs uncomfortably as it lands on the soul, no moniker describes Bandcamp more comprehensively than “an online record store.” As far as [Ethans](https:\/\/youtu.be\/inzhStQJFQw) go, Bandcamp’s CEO and founders’ public attaché Ethan Diamond is as good as they come: it’s quite telling that he is the only Silicon Valley CEO who’s remained intellectually grounded enough with the rest of us in order to retain any skills in nuanced forms of verbal communication like… humor. The closest the company has ever come to promotion? His awkward, sub-20-minute [presentation](https:\/\/youtu.be\/MaUkS-lr-ZM) at the XOXO Festival 2014 offered an impressively succinct introduction to their greater mission considering the unmistakable agony in his body language. \n\n“We worked out of the public library for the first four years of the company's existence,” he admits. Impressively, Bandcamp was operated entirely as a “virtual company” until 2015.\n\nEither Bandcamp just happens to be the single Silicon Valley company where the executives are unanimously so fucking fulfilled by their work without exception that they aren’t compelled to leave it long enough to stumble upon the inevitable coastal colleague with a connection to something like The Internet History Podcast, or technology journalism has definitively lost all reverence for actual innovation in favor of the [emotionally-charged](https:\/\/www.bcg.com\/en-us\/publications\/2018\/ideas-emotions-innovation-riding-amazement-cycle.aspx) Innovation Myth, now [relinquished almost entirely](https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2018\/7\/24\/17610348\/twitter-elon-musk-display-name-change-lock-account-crypto-scams) to the narrative control of its own protagonists. Perhaps it was inevitable that Elon Musk, Sundar Pichai, Mark Zuckerberg, and Jeff Bezos would become immortalized as “those who make things happen,” but our ability to quantify value as consumers tends to scurry rapidly away behind our backs when they’re turned by the constant distraction of these mostly inert figureheads. As their personalities have stolen the story, the people in industry with their hands on real product have all but completely disappeared from the frame, and all of the work remaining at the End User’s eye level was abandoned by aspiration long ago and replaced with the unfulfilling mechanism of A Quick Buck. Though now we are proceeding into a similar frame – only because our subject cares more about their mission than claiming recognition for it and might just be the first such company run by a cast who become sincerely defensive at the suggestion of a cash-out.\n\n“Bandcamp’s philosophy has always been very different [from] a lot of the companies we’re surrounded by,” reflects Jervis. “We are not a ‘let’s-raise-money-and-burn-through-it’ type of company.”\n\nI know that your mind has been trained by years of engagement with the digital media of a rapidly-globalizing, venture capital-obsessed society to block the passage of this sort of language across your conscious threshold at risk of life-threatening overexposure to the Medium Dialect and its churnalising neoliberal cyberchode scholars of the Personal Brand; I know you’ve read the exact same quote from how many entrepreneurs in how many worthless, masturbatory business magazine profiles, but I swear on my one-of-a-kind Estonian Hilary Duff pullout that Jervis speaks without irony or deception. how many fucking churnicles have abandoned you, but this time, it’s actually sincere.\n\n<iframe style=\"border: 0; width: 100%; height: 120px;\" src=\"https:\/\/bandcamp.com\/EmbeddedPlayer\/album=3931299777\/size=large\/bgcol=ffffff\/linkcol=00006b\/tracklist=false\/artwork=small\/track=2212865095\/transparent=true\/\" seamless><a href=\"http:\/\/mosessumney.bandcamp.com\/album\/black-in-deep-red-2014\">Black in Deep Red, 2014 by Moses Sumney<\/a><\/iframe>\n\n# On The Web\n\nThough Bandcamp was technically the first comprehensive library-modeled music streaming service in existence, the topical conversations between both technology and music journalists and industry executives flooding both podcast and news feeds at the moment orbiting the “Cord-Cutting” phenomena as it’s washed over television, cinema, and music are rooted in the same building blocks as the core technology behind the delivery of all of these conversations as well as their subjects, funny enough. As long as my subgeneration has known it, The Web has been a source of sound in some manifestation, but the example with the most perplexing history was also the first. Today, one of five tabs in the main menu of my iPhone’s native music app contains the text “Radio” beneath an “antenna with waves” graphic which opens a service once called [iTunes Radio](https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20150608143103\/https:\/www.apple.com\/itunes\/itunes-radio\/) that was absorbed into – and [restricted to subscribers of](https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2016\/1\/15\/10777790\/itunes-radio-apple-music-january-28) – Apple Music as of 2016, confusingly. However, both “iTunes Radio” and “Apple Music Radio(?)” – along with any and all audio streaming services (mentioned and not) – are fundamentally nothing more than different UX design interpretations of the “simple” practice of streaming an audio file, which made its debut at the turn of the century in the form of “Internet Radio.” Astonishingly, the protocol – still referred to by at least one person on Earth as “Webcasting,” no doubt – has survived nearly 20 years, and even the youngest of us have likely encountered it in unusual situations. \n\nIronically, the [majority](http:\/\/radio.garden\/) of Internet Radio broadcasts remaining on the air are nothing more than live duplicates of the traditional radio wave-bound products from the physical stations your car’s head unit receives. Even the current desktop version of iTunes maintains support for streaming “audio files over the internet,” though a glance at [Apple’s dated support page](https:\/\/support.apple.com\/kb\/PH19478?locale=en_US) for the process suggests it hasn’t crossed anybody’s mind for at least half of that history. In 1994, the publicly-funded radio network Voice of America became the “[First [radio] on the Internet](http:\/\/www.chriskern.net\/history\/voaFirstOnTheInternet.html)” when it [began](https:\/\/groups.google.com\/forum\/?hl=en#!original\/rec.radio.shortwave\/2pQ9KUYmLqo\/wqhhXS2k-lAJ) – after an introduction by Al Gore, no less – “offering digitized audio versions of selected newscasts and other program segments in 15 languages on its public internet server on Monday, Aug. 15,” according to former engineer Chris Kern. However – since we’re already this deep into internet history – a distinction must be established between streaming static files and streaming live audio. The first relies on pre-recorded audio files uploaded to a publicly-accessible server – in Kern’s original case, “via anonymous FTP and the Internet Gopher protocol,” which continues to be the elemental process behind every audio file streamed across the Web (including those on Bandcamp, Apple Music, Spotify, etc.) more or less because it ain’t broke. \n\nSemantically, “live” digital audio streaming in its aforementioned “purest” form is more or less exclusive to Internet Radio. Obscured aside from the traditional station simulcast, Web-only Internet Radio stations have their own of “[the Internet’s quiet success stories](https:\/\/www.thestar.com\/business\/2007\/04\/09\/web_radio_may_stream_north_to_canada.html),” filled with quaint experiences and an endless cycle of death proclamations which continue to be disproven, anywise.\n\nOn June 27th, 1999, *The Seattle Times* ran [an especially worthwhile introduction to the concept](http:\/\/community.seattletimes.nwsource.com\/archive\/?date=19990627&slug=2968794) that likely represents the only major newspaper’s mention of SHOUTcast (the first and likely last name in DIY Web DJing) in the history of the printed word within a work of truly phenomenal tech reporting on Mark Mataassa’s part. From the past, one will find his chillingly spot-on foresight and well-considered observations are bestrewed with mind-boggling hilarity when they look.\n\n> Dialing in to the Net through a 56 kilobit-per-second modem, as I am, this seems like a ridiculous waste - or at least misallocation - of resources.\n>\n> I'm using a $3,000 machine, tying up a phone line and seriously compromising my computing power for an experience that in sound quality, simplicity and dependability can't compare, truthfully, with the $9 Emerson clock radio an arm's length away.\n>\n> And yet Web radio is one of the hottest ideas going in the ever-hot world of Internet startups and acquisitions: In the past few months, America Online and Yahoo! each have purchased fast-growing Web music sites, rock-music trendsetters like Rolling Stone and MTV have gotten into the business, and technological improvements - from Microsoft's newest browser and Real Networks' newest player to the latest MP3 enhancements - are closing the quality and accessibility gaps.\n>\n> The combination of developments is not only changing how computers (and radios) are used, but offering a glimpse of a future when audience demographics are sliced ultra-thin - to the person - and everybody has the potential to be a radio broadcaster as well as listener.\n\nI only have a few experiences with Internet Radio of my own, but they’re all rampantly more memorable than one would expect. The now in-stasis [NWIRE](https:\/\/twitter.com\/nwireradio) project was by the most relevantly intriguing and [savvily-curated](https:\/\/soundcloud.com\/themartmusic\/nwire-radio-guest-mix-11-feb-2017) home for a diverse host of electronic musicians I’ve ever come across – it was my second default browser tab for most of 2017, when I’d even listen to the odd-hour broadcasts overseen by just the automated library-perusing bot for hours. On [episode 16 of *Drycast*](https:\/\/anchor.fm\/extratone\/episodes\/Juke-Master-Samantha-Carter-and-the-Producers-Extravaganza-e1neqc\/a-a4674c), I recounted [the absurd tale](https:\/\/clyp.it\/mps4yfyv) of my surprise morning encounter with a Norwegian station’s live broadcast from some European breakcore club, which was likely responsible for the most fun I’ve ever had working in retail.\n\n<iframe style=\"border: 0; width: 100%; height: 120px;\" src=\"https:\/\/bandcamp.com\/EmbeddedPlayer\/album=374449027\/size=large\/bgcol=ffffff\/linkcol=00006b\/tracklist=false\/artwork=small\/track=1571966121\/transparent=true\/\" seamless><a href=\"http:\/\/ultrademon.bandcamp.com\/album\/seapunk\">Seapunk by Ultrademon<\/a><\/iframe>\n\n*Extratone*’s former Tech Editor is partial to a station called [Radio Swiss Jazz](http:\/\/www.radioswissjazz.ch\/en), which appears to be thriving in comparison with most visible broadcasters, and unapologetically emits a bizarre amalgamation of tunes both chart-topping and Seriously Obscure across every conceivable genre (including Marching Music,) and continent of origin. Between every few charts, the brief commentary and station identification has provided our own private mystery: Was that one pre-recorded? This guy was on yesterday, but has since shed his accent? However, these tiny temporary mysteries are Internet Radio’s only remaining value for us, and I suspect the same is true for all but the most laggard laggards. For as long as I’ve been coherent enough to disseminate between much of anything, very few of its visible offerings have offered anything groundbreaking or fresh, perhaps out of negligence (one can very easily arrange leave a machine running SHOUTcast to shuffle through a given library of music and\/or podcasts indefinitely,) frustration, or economic necessity.\n\nCrucially, the truly *most* critical consequences and contributions provided by the pioneers of Internet Radio to our current digital streaming experience were centered within intellectual property legislation and advertising-supported business. Unfortunately, this juncture marks our complete departure from my wheelhouse, but thankfully, a few sacred accounts of one of technology’s foremost confusing clashes with the ill-equipped, technoilliterate monoliths of the American justice system do indeed remain. As early as 2002, the ineffable Doc Searls reported on a document authored by the Library of Congress’ Copyright Royalty Board called “[Determination of Royalty Rates and Terms for Ephemeral Recording and Webcasting Digital Performance of Sound Recordings](https:\/\/www.federalregister.gov\/documents\/2016\/05\/02\/2016-09707\/determination-of-royalty-rates-and-terms-for-ephemeral-recording-and-webcasting-digital-performance)” for *Linux Journal* in an encyclopedic breakdown of its implications ironically entitled “[Why Are So Many Internet Radio Stations Still on the Air](https:\/\/www.linuxjournal.com\/article\/6218)?” I would hope my comprehension is sufficient to declare that *this was no Cambridge Analytica*: only a few years subsequent the technology’s inception, operators within the Internet Radio business faced serious and immediate fines for their pre-enforcement distribution of copyrighted material stretching *four years* back – the severity of which the Doc suggested would “surely bankrupt many of the individual broadcasters that have been pioneering this marketplace for the longest time.”\n\n> Unlike the commercial radio stations we hear on the old-fashioned airwaves, Internet radio stations' primary market relationship isn't with advertisers; it's with listeners. In many cases, the listeners are the primary source of revenue. This business model is similar to that of noncommercial (public) radio, only the market relationship is much more direct and efficient. Internet radio stations don't need to stop programming to hold marathon whine-fests begging listeners to call phone volunteers and pledge money to qualify for a mug or a t-shirt. Listeners simply click on a PayPal or an Amazon link, and after a few more clicks they've made a payment.\n\nBy [March, 2010](https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20100330102643\/http:\/directory.google.com\/Top\/Arts\/Music\/Sound_Files\/MP3\/Streaming\/Stations), just 374 stations were aggregated in Google’s Internet Radio Directory, and my own quick sample from its list unfortunately indicated that most are now silent, but SHOUTcast has yet to be abandoned after all this time and we can safely suppose the core architecture of the internet will remain recognizable enough to support it until after we’re all dead, rendering the necessary tools indefinitely ready and accessible should new projects in NWIRE’s vein come along (I know of no better fate I could wish upon the protocol.) From Internet Radio’s pioneer days, we must skip over a whole era to close in on Bandcamp’s origin in the very brightest peak of Web 2.0.\n\nAgain, we find ourselves in 2008 and nobody knows what an iPhone is, but the same classic rock-worshiping, upper-middle class, white collar Early Majority who first loved Internet Radio are now rapidly and delightedly distributing links to something called “Pandora dot com” between AOL and Hotmail inboxes. True luxury music reproduction comes in the form of Beats headphones motivated by a 320GB iPod Classic. Budding audiophiles and backpacker dweebs illegally torrent lossless .FLACs to play over their Christmas-gifted studio monitors with WinAmp, which they’ve set up to impeccably “scrobble” their history with every played track to their Last.fm profiles. Everybody else is still buying music from iTunes. (Those who cannot afford to buy the music they intend to add to their libraries transition to the music nerd classification as soon as they’ve sought out a way to obtain it free.) “Streaming” comes from subscription services like Rhapsody (now Napster,) which are [too buried in Digital Rights Management controversy](http:\/\/www.alphr.com\/features\/218559\/the-online-music-rip-off) to feel sustainable. MySpace Music has just begun to fade away – next year, in “the Twitter era,” [SoundCloud will definitively replace it](https:\/\/www.wired.com\/2009\/07\/soundcloud-threatens-myspace-as-music-destination-for-twitter-era\/) as the go-to creator network – and Pandora’s immediate future is bright – they’ll make a big move on brand-new mobile streaming experience when they [launch their iPhone OS app](https:\/\/www.cnet.com\/news\/photos-hands-on-with-pandoras-internet-radio-iphone-app\/) in July, but the limited performance of the handset’s EDGE network will render it a poor alternative to onsite .mp3s for years to come.\n\nIn January, to minimal acclaim, Oddpost’s Ethan Diamond launched Bandcamp, the startup with programmer friends Joe Holt, Shawn Grunberger, and Neal Tucker to be “a sortof WordPress for musicians” – an easily-created, well-designed landing page to showcase one’s digital music files. As Holt laments in [an interview with ](http:\/\/htmltimes.com\/band-camp.php)*The HTML Times*, creating an online presence for your music had long been “a pain in the ass.” \n\n“You need to find a place to host it, you’ve gotta get the metadata right, it’s just hard. So we just decided we would do that hard part for musicians so that they didn’t have to be so nerdy.”\n\nAs an address to all of their shared complaints about the experience of online music distribution up to that point, [early Bandcamp](https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20090716104620\/http:\/bandcamp.com) was an astounding piece of engineering. The quaint, unsurprisingly crate-digger-looking Ethan Diamond – who’s more or less remained the singular public face of the company since the very beginning – began a brand tradition of transparently music-nerdy correspondence with his [first post on the Bandcamp blog](https:\/\/daily.bandcamp.com\/2008\/09\/16\/hello-cleveland\/), explaining the solutions the team had come up with in greater detail.\n\n> We keep your music streaming and downloading quickly and reliably, whether it’s 3am on a Sunday, or the hour your new record drops and Pitchfork gives it a scathingly positive review. We make your tracks available in every format under the sun, so the audiophilic nerderati can have their FLAC and eat mp3 v2. We adorn your songs with all the right metadata, so they sail into iTunes with artwork, album, band and track names intact. We mutter the various incantations necessary to keep your site top-ranked in Google, so when your fans search for your hits, they find your music long before they find bonkersforlyrics.com or iMyFace. We give your fans easy ways to share your music with their friends, and we give you gorgeous tools that reveal exactly how your music is spreading, so you can fan the fire.\n\nThe launch garnered very little attention from tech or music publications of the time, but [Andy Baio’s interview with Diamond](https:\/\/waxy.org\/2008\/09\/bandcamp_launch\/) provides a substantial, technically in-depth picture of just how revolutionary and necessary it was. Most of what has continued to make Bandcamp such an essential tool was present at the very beginning: server-side stats and metadata (a unique architectural undertaking, no doubt,) track and album-oriented pagination, and a robust, easily-embedded Flash player.\n\n<div style=\"padding:56.25% 0 0 0;position:relative;\"><iframe src=\"https:\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/1739268?title=0&byline=0&portrait=0\" style=\"position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:auto;height:auto;\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div><script src=\"https:\/\/player.vimeo.com\/api\/player.js\"><\/script>\n\nStudy [Diamond’s first “screencast”](https:\/\/vimeo.com\/1739268) alongside a [video tour of SoundCloud](https:\/\/vimeo.com\/1857085) from the period and you’ll notice just how much more functional, future-proofed and *dignified* Bandcamp appeared in comparison. As apprehensive as I am to be caught arguing for minimalism over good design, it’s made perfect sense in the use case of *this one platform*, which knew *exactly* what it was from birth, along with what it would *always* be, apparently, which is such a bizarre reversal of the archetypes and the relentless common narrative we know from The Valley’s legends. Ethan first shows the consumer’s experience – none of which has changed after a whole decade aside from quality-specific track purchases – before delving into the artist-side UI, beginning with the statistics tool, which included playback and search insights to a depth that was (and still is) unheard of from a free service. Then, he demonstrates the publishing process from upload to playback: adding album art, setting a release date, and pricing its purchase. Aside from their removal of the old waveform visualizer (I couldn’t find any record of an announcement of this decision, official or otherwise,) Bandcamp has changed absolutely *nothing* of what’s shown in Diamond’s tutorial. In the next few months, they would add [custom page design](https:\/\/daily.bandcamp.com\/2008\/11\/26\/design-customization\/), [email address capture](https:\/\/daily.bandcamp.com\/2008\/12\/22\/free-download-email-capture-thingy\/), and [support for custom domains](https:\/\/daily.bandcamp.com\/2009\/01\/23\/custom-domains-custom-domains\/). By October 2008, they’d made enough waves to be [picked up by ](https:\/\/www.cnet.com\/news\/bandcamp-for-cleaner-music-sites\/)*CNET*, for whatever that was worth. Apparently, [Facebook Music](https:\/\/venturebeat.com\/2008\/10\/22\/facebook-music-is-getting-its-act-together\/) was a legitimate property as well, but I do not remember anything about it at all—pondering an alternate reality in which *The* Social Network became the dominant online music streaming platform leads to a bizarre comparison of Neil Diamond and Mark Zuckerberg which I can’t imagine being altogether productive. Suffice it to say, the two founders’ visions differ greatly.\n\n<iframe style=\"border: 0; width: 100%; height: 120px;\" src=\"https:\/\/bandcamp.com\/EmbeddedPlayer\/album=118415374\/size=large\/bgcol=ffffff\/linkcol=00006b\/tracklist=false\/artwork=small\/track=1797536753\/transparent=true\/\" seamless><a href=\"http:\/\/fivestarhotel.bandcamp.com\/album\/open-wound\">Open Wound by Five Star Hotel<\/a><\/iframe>\n\n# Musicblogocide\n\nContextually, it’s also important that we dwell for a moment on the legal and financial hullabaloo surrounding music sales during Bandcamp’s first formative years, and the federal government’s losing battle to interpret, enforce, or replace intellectual property law for the information age. As the Web had grown exponentially more capable and accessible as a means of audio file distribution, it had become absolutely saturated with blatantly DRM-circumventing .mp3s and .wavs. For years, the quickest way to follow up on a *check it out* sort of music recommendation was simply to search Google for its track name followed by “.mp3.” If the first go didn’t yield success, even the most rudimentary application of cryptography – like substituting some variation of “nsilmtic.rar” to find a download for Nas’ *Illmatic*, for instance – was a sure bet for one’s second try, which would often return several copies just laying around Google-indexed WordPress media libraries, though results hosted on Mediafire were a preferable alternative. This was the establishment into which my first adolescent digital music discoveries were borned, and I’m still convinced that 99% of us participants were completely without malice. I’d argue heartily that music’s brief escape from the tireless grip of the record industry as its only medium stumbled into digital form would be clearly shown to have a net gain for the whole of American recording artists if you could measure and plot it, including the past, present, and future use of peer-to-peer sharing.\n\n2010 would prove to be The Year of Reckoning for the fraction of DRM-violating traffic on the *visible* Web, at least. Though it’d be virtually impossible to quantify, is it only reasonable to assume that many siteowners made some real money from the ad impressions that directly resulted from their unauthorized hosting and Mediafire-embedding, but let’s consider how minuscule even the most outrageously liberal overestimate would be, side-by-side with the billions in additional revenue YouTube has raked in from the same music since assuming their place as the de facto platform for quickly summoning just about any work of audio that’s ever taken digital form. It was in February of that year that Blogger (another Google property) [deleted six music blogs](https:\/\/blogger.googleblog.com\/2010\/02\/quick-note-about-music-blog-removals.html) from its platform in response to complaints about allegedly DMCA-violating .mp3s. *The Registry* [insisted](https:\/\/www.theregister.co.uk\/2010\/02\/11\/google_musicblogocide_2010\/) the collective finger be pointed at the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, itself. \n\n“It would seem the music bloggers aren't versed in the ways of DMCA claims and counterclaims. But you can't blame Google for that,” they concluded, after one of the blog’s founders expressed some of the most personally-dramatic words mine empathy has yet faced as [quoted in The Guardian](https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/music\/2010\/feb\/11\/google-deletes-music-blogs).\n\n“It's just sad because we were documenting young people's music from all around the globe. For a lot of people, it was music they wouldn't have been able to discover elsewhere.”\n\nIn hindsight, “blame” is an even more useless avenue of one’s attention than usual, especially when one party (Google) was 100% exempt from any consequences all along. The alarming takeaway is not the DMCA’s deftness, but that **Google had the freedom to wait for a parallel business incentive before deciding the law applied to them**.\n\nFrankly, we should all have realized long ago just how fucking futile it is to attempt to control any file traffic. Every desktop-class browser ships with the capability to capture any streamable media on the Web with a handful of keystrokes – it’d take a maximum of 20 minutes to bestow upon even the most casual user the knowledge they’d need to keep every single track, YouTube video, and Twitch stream they’d ever watch, 100% legally without a single third-party service\/extension interaction, but the crucial question remains to what end, exactly? It’s easy, but it’s not exactly a fun way to spend an afternoon. The only two rationales that’d justify capturing streamed Web files at scale are 1) the totally bonkers inclination that any given property\/ies is likely to disappear from the entire World Wide Web, ever or 2) the increasingly rarefying expectation of prolonged time away from internet access. \n\nAs Bandcamp has stood so obdurately still, the mainstream music streaming sphere has expanded titanically around it as if enveloping the Indie platform in a surrealist timelapse within the eye of a ruinous tech industry cyclone, which would explosively expand the market into a ghoulish, filthy monstrosity beyond anything we’d recognize from the rule of the WinAmp Hipster, long ago. **Today, the coolest and most rabid daily music listeners I know all have Spotify memberships**, joining [70 million others](https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2018\/1\/4\/16850742\/spotify-subscriber-count-70-million-users) globally as of January. For most, it’s how they prefer to swaddle their lives in a constant soundtrack – at work, in the car, at school, then at home on the television. For many, it’s how they “explore” new music outside of peer and social recommendations... or, that’s how the narrative was supposed to go, anyway. Those folks I know who actually create music, however, are rarely seen using Spotify—even after they’ve endured untold horrors in order to publish their own music there—because the real story of its track record as a place to “Discover” new artists, genres, or sounds is completely abysmal. When 2017’s streaming data began coming in this past January, a popular feature by [Galaxie 500](http:\/\/galaxie500.bandcamp.com\/)’s Damon Krukowski was run by the definitively terminal music magazine of broad notoriety—*Pitchfork*—entitled “[How to Be a Responsible Music Fan in the Age of Streaming](https:\/\/pitchfork.com\/features\/oped\/how-to-be-a-responsible-music-fan-in-the-age-of-streaming\/),” which he began by citing some very alarming statistics.\n\n“**More than 99 percent of audio streaming is of the top 10 percent most-streamed tracks** [on Spotify.] Which means less than 1 percent of streams account for all other music.” \n\nWhy? A brazen disregard for necessary meta information, for one.\n\n“Look now at how badly their applications already serve entire genres of less popular music. Spotify lists recordings by song title, album title, or featured artist name. But that information is so limited it leaves out even the other performers on a recording, a crucial aspect to classical and jazz.”\n\n![Spotify-Pitfork](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/96z3H8C.png)\n\nAlarming for those of us who intend to create or consume any music separate the Top 40, anyway, which one should feel justified expecting from most people, most of the time. Last month, The Carters released an album on which [even Beyoncé](https:\/\/www.bustle.com\/p\/when-will-everything-is-love-be-on-spotify-beyonce-jay-z-fans-may-have-to-wait-to-stream-the-surprise-album-update-9426616) identified the problematic service by name. “Patiently waiting for my demise ‘cause my success can’t be quantified,” she rapped, “if I gave two fucks about streaming numbers woulda put Lemonade up on Spotify.\" The unfortunate issue with this single denouncement of the industry’s current direction is that its source is adamantly guaranteed a place for her work within Spotify’s top 10 percent for the rest of her career’s lifetime (and probably far beyond.)\n\n[I could now take the time to complain that she’s also entirely abandoned the city [she owes for her career’s creation](https:\/\/youtu.be\/iiMlq8frlqw) in its darkest hour, but let’s just plan on coming back to the subject at a later date, when we’ll be sure to touch on how terribly Drake also treats Houston (and women.)]\n\nUnsurprisingly, the apathy is far from mutual. From the Swedish company’s perspective, the digits themselves should’ve been dearly and universally beloved from the beginning, and their exponentially ballooning hubris became so inflated by 2014 that they [launched a WordPress blog](https:\/\/insights.spotify.com\/us\/about-spotify-insights\/) dedicated entirely to promoting and discussing their data called [*Spotify Insights*](https:\/\/insights.spotify.com\/), proclaiming themselves—naturally—to be “the world’s favorite streaming service,” [championing](https:\/\/insights.spotify.com\/us\/2017\/11\/02\/listening-diversity-spotify\/) the growing diversity in their demographics. Though Beyoncé is mentioned only twice upon a [search of its archive](https:\/\/insights.spotify.com\/us\/?s=beyonce) as it stands today, it’s with fanfare: “[10 Female Artists Women Listen To The Most on Spotify](https:\/\/insights.spotify.com\/us\/2015\/03\/06\/10-female-artists-women-listen-to-the-most\/)” declared her the third most popular female artist among women, globally, and “Single Ladies” the number one female-streamed track in the world (assuming I’m interpreting its language correctly.)\n\n<iframe style=\"border: 0; width: 100%; height: 120px;\" src=\"https:\/\/bandcamp.com\/EmbeddedPlayer\/album=3826527505\/size=large\/bgcol=ffffff\/linkcol=00006b\/tracklist=false\/artwork=small\/track=1880328200\/transparent=true\/\" seamless><a href=\"http:\/\/pressurerecords.bandcamp.com\/album\/k-o\">K.O. by Miss Red<\/a><\/iframe>\n\nWe’ve established that Spotify has comfortably planted itself at the polar opposite end of the business spectrum from Bandcamp, yet for the sake of an oblivious adjudicating layman’s understanding, you’d have your work cut out for you explaining the difference between them: both are online marketplaces with gigantic libraries of digital music which a listener can browse, download locally, or stream from using Web browser or the mobile applications offered by each, respectively—and they can do from just about anywhere, for as much or as little as they wish. And—as the music industry and its satellites shall always remain for the rest of humanity’s reign—both are overwhelmingly associated with young people. There, the crucial divide should probably ring a bell—it’s been a constant between cultural generations for as long as culture, itself has existed.\n\nThere are those among us who’s adolescent adoration of music is still completely valid as a very powerful component of hormonal development, yet doomed to quickly sizzle into casual listening or worse by the time our post-secondary Senior year rolls around. And then, there are those on whom the curiosity clings devotedly on: the cool high school punk band-forming types our culture loves to romanticize, who’ll inevitably end up bald and bespeckled with a pre-dawn community radio block. These Musicians, Crate-Diggers, and capital-A Audiophiles have historically overlapped in synonymous functions across a love triangle of dweebish intolerability, though it’s become especially easy as of late to forget that DIY recording is by no means a recent development—its financial and technical barrier-to-entry has simply plummeted thanks to the developmental progression of Digital Audio Workstations and a growing industry of consumer-oriented audio equipment. For succinct insight into this dynamic, let’s refer to the pre-dialogue context in [Chuck Klosterman’s *GQ* interview](https:\/\/www.gq.com\/story\/jimmy-page-led-zeppelin-men-of-the-year-klosterman) with “the second- or the third-best rock guitarist of all time”—*Zinc Blimp* legend Jumbo Page.\n\n> The only thing Page really wants to talk about [is] the sound of the music, and how that sound was achieved. He can talk about microphone placement for a very, very long time. Are you interested in having a detailed conversation about how the glue used with magnetic audiotape was altered in the late 1970s, subsequently leading to the disintegration of countless master tapes? If so, locate Jimmy Page. If a different musician obsessed over technological details with this level of exacting specificity, he would likely be classified as a “nerd,\" as that has become a strange kind of compliment in the Internet age. People actually want to be seen as nerds. But that designation does not apply here. Jimmy Page does not seem remotely nerdy.\n\nBandcamp’s core architecture was handbuilt from the beginning to handle the “hard part” for creators “so that they didn’t have to be so nerdy,” which it, alone pioneered on the Web, becoming the best metadata management utility for all time, but also committing to a traditional interpretation of music mediums that can feel old fashioned in 2018. Despite having been around for a directly comparable length of time, SoundCloud has maintained its relevance among friends in my network as the more socially-focused platform for keeping up with work from their peers thanks in large part to its exclusive, timestamp-oriented comment function, which allows for ultra-specific shortform feedback between fellow creators and fans. This is how the company has chosen to grow its community, which has lent especially to its strength in the most “nerdy” independent scenes: hip-hop and electronic music. The experience is busy by design and the divide between listener and creator is next to non-existent—by now, the difference is universally irrelevant. External sharing has also become a major strength since the inception of SoundCloud’s Web audio player, which was unlike any other embeddable we’d ever seen at the time. Over the years, it’s become the most universally-supported means of embedding a track or playlist elsewhere, though the space has quite recently began blooming with a few much slimmer Open Web offshoots like Vocaroo, Clyp, and Instaudio.\n\nWhile I can casually throw these names around for you in the same sized font, the gulfs between the properties they denote are completely inexpressible in words. Because Spotify went public in Q1 of this year, they released [their first earnings report](https:\/\/www.businesswire.com\/news\/home\/20180502006667\/en\/) in April: 170 million active monthly users, $1.33 billion in total quarterly revenue, and $5.7-$6.2 billion in expected total revenue for 2018. I’ll spare you the entire Forbes piece it would require to comprehensively demonstrate just how cavernous of a disparity canyon the industry represents. Early projects like Pandora were docile, ad-free, and sincerely curious about the curatorial potential of music streaming services – *let’s use this cool new tech to play **music** for **anybody** with a Web browser if only because it’ll be a blast* – yet in that sense, they’ve all failed entirely. All except Bandcamp, anyway.\n\n“We started as a service to help artists sell their music and merchandise directly to their fans, but then as the site grew—it’s now at about 12 million tracks and 1.5 million albums [as of 2014]—we evolved into also being a destination for music Discovery,” he explains, partially anticipating the foot-to-the-floor transition to streaming which has indeed shook the industry the hell up over the years since. The company's solution is minimal, elemental, yet uniquely alternative as only theirs could be: an idealized **digital interpretation of a music collection**, which had actually launched a year before XOXO as part of “[Bandcamp for Fans](https:\/\/daily.bandcamp.com\/2013\/01\/10\/bandcamp-for-fans\/).” That release notably introduced the ability to “follow” both artist and fan accounts, the now-iconic “supported-by” section on release pages showing customers’ avatars and optional comments, and public wishlists. “I think it’s great to use a streaming service for music Discovery—they can be really really good for that,” Diamond [concedes](https:\/\/youtu.be\/MaUkS-lr-ZM?t=16m11s), before reiterating one of the several variations of Bandcamp’s founding premise that composes his core argument: “if you actually care about music, and you care about the people who make it, and you want them to keep making it, the best way to do that is to buy directly from them, or to use services that allow you to directly support them.”\n\nInstead of the “firehose”-like experience of a contemporary activity feed, “you’ve got a collection of albums and tracks that people were passionate enough to spend money on.” For my personal use, Ethan lit up a long-dormant incandescent bulb in my skull. My use of Bandcamp had long been to purchase and download music files, only—never to stream it—and there’s been good reason for this. While Bandcamp has formally supported playback on iPhone and iPad in-browser since [July 2010](https:\/\/daily.bandcamp.com\/2010\/07\/14\/now-streaming-on-the-ipad-iphone\/), actually using it for any substantial amount of playback has always been a souring endeavor. Considering that it’s persisted *to this day*, we must concede that it is part of an intentional design rather than just an irritating flaw: **multitasking between apps or even browser tabs will prevent continuous playback of an album**, as will locking the device. In order to move from track to track fluidly, one must keep the page with the in-use Bandcamp player front and center. For three years, this was the only way to stream Bandcamp on mobile, but such capability was far from reliably expected by even the earliest adopters, then—3G data networks were worse than you remember, anyway—and then in 2013, [the Bandcamp app was launched](https:\/\/daily.bandcamp.com\/2013\/10\/25\/its-over\/) on iOS and Android, providing a sufficient fix in my book at the time. (I’d rather any externally-embedded players I may engage with in an album review or artist profile be limited to a single track, anyway.) However, the app itself remained quite mediocre for years, which was a tangible disappointment given how revolutionary their desktop experience had been when the company launched,but not necessarily a substantial deterrent to the sort of user they were attracting.\n\nI made a point to spend *a lot* of time engaging with Bandcamp’s service as much as possible – naturally, this included a trip back through [my neglected, digitally dusty Collection](http:\/\/bandcamp.com\/davidblue), which proved a way more emotionally provocative experience than I anticipated. Ethan’s simple truth didn’t really sink in until I realized that this list is made up exclusively of my *real favorites*, and there’s not a single track that is not inextricably and intoxicatingly tied to a specific era(s) of my life (yes, even that one Blank Banshee album... I was 18, okay?) It’s absurdly powerful—not something I could engage with for any extended time without becoming saturated with nostalgic gut stuff. (Listen for my upcoming special celebratory episode of [Extratone Radio](http:\/\/extratone.com\/radio) to hear the best music I’ve found through Bandcamp.) It hadn’t occurred to me that I would retain ownership and streaming rights to all music I’ve purchased—including for a $0.00 sum, as I did for at least half of the works you see—even after an artist chose to delete or hide it on their own page. (Though they are not retained in my public collection, of course.)\n\n<iframe style=\"border: 0; width: 100%; height: 120px;\" src=\"https:\/\/bandcamp.com\/EmbeddedPlayer\/album=645929553\/size=large\/bgcol=ffffff\/linkcol=00006b\/tracklist=false\/artwork=small\/track=50735221\/transparent=true\/\" seamless><a href=\"https:\/\/4lrecords.bandcamp.com\/album\/recycle-bin\">\\$Recycle.Bin by KING QUARTZ<\/a><\/iframe>\n\n# The Discovery Debacle\n\nPursuing an objective definition of “music Discovery” might appear foolish – an individual’s music taste is perhaps the most broadly angst-steeped realms of overwhelming subjectivity in modern American culture, after all – but its the pungent poignancy of our fundamental human relationship with sound, itself which makes the history of Discovery’s digitization so important (and fascinating.) If I were to ask you what you believe should be the single most important function that must be reliably performed by any “music Discovery” device – whether it be an application, Web service, magazine or even a crate-digging habit – the single factor which would render whole vague concept inert, irrelevant, and\/or completely destroyed, how would you answer? How would you interpret the question? \n\nIt’s important we do well to take a considerable moment to cultivate a special wariness of the eggshells beneath our feet in this arena. Debatably at least a minim more than one’s taste in film, Americans from Generation X on forward until the end of time (I suspect) will hold “their” music as perhaps the most integral support upon which their identities are built throughout every stage of their lives. The intense sensation of ownership that propels this phenomenon within our culture leaves an especially sensitive passage ahead of us.\n\nAs a wide-eyed teenager and infantile audio producer, I explored the idea of anti-music in my own entirely Bandcamp-supported project while I searched – aided tremendously by my expert best friend – for the edgiest, least sensical sounds and scenes on which to publicly attach on my identity in an opposing of “Discovery’s” extremes with fandom: **an obsessive, entirely-detached last-ditch skirmish between the cultural reality and my delusional pubescent need to be unique**. This process appears to be a universal requisite in modern youth in one form or another, but it’s important now that I emphasize this confession: I was an especially ostentatious little backpacker fuck, but I’ve continued to find my shame well worth achieving a specific balance for music’s purpose in my life, and I’d anecdotally endorse its potential to relieve cognitive dissonance at great scale. There’s only so much fun to be had blasting breakcore cassettes at deafening, distorted volumes solely to bewilder rural overnight convenience store clerks on their smoke breaks in the wee hours or the bruteforce seizure of the speakers’ Bluetooth connection at a frat party just to play harsh noise or anime-sampling Hardstyle while demonically shrieking – eyes rolled back – and lighting various parts of oneself ablaze before one realizes that 1) it’s they who end up looking like the idiots for aggressively breaching a group’s fun with inappropriate tunes (yes, no matter how interesting, rare, or underrated they may be, Chadley;) 2) by ferally manifesting, you’ve deligitimized yourself, which 3) can seriously damage any future attempts to accomplish **the fundamental drive to share the gospel of music’s variety** out of your own rubish frustration with the differences between you.\n\nThe real, sweetest truth is that **100% of all music has value potential** because of the medium’s broad influence on the human psyche. Pop music is amazing right now; the signature trap sound we devalued with Datpiff jokes made us all look like fools when it unconsciously transcended our “irony” and burrowed its own huge partition in our sincere hearts. After my pitiful attempt to reject and distance myself from my own rural roots by scoffing at country music for years, I’ve made a beautiful peace with the childhood memories and the historic excellence of Shania Twain and The Dixie Chicks in their mastery of both wholesome joy and crippling nostalgia (I’ve even cried to Taylor Swift.) Yes, it’s been entirely reasonable all along to enjoy the straightforwardly slothen pleasure in belching “Sweet Home Alabama” pounding cheap pissbeer on a foul pontoon boat on the Lake of the Ozarks, leaving my penultimate irony to confess that I’ve only found true and serene identity through music after learning how to stop insisting so violently upon the worldly, one-of-a-kind superiority of my “taste.”\n\nThat said, it’s still bewildering how content we are to abruptly abandon the substance music had to our teenage selves out of misconstrued justifications for our classic fainéance – actively choosing to subject our public ambiance to thousands of replays of “the best” records in favor of dipping even the most cowardly toe into unfamiliar waters, even when the opportunity cost is inherently halved – only to then have the audacity to evangelize our dilapidated conceptions of “good music” to our children as we demonize the music of their generation, depriving them of a very essential rite of their cognitive development. **I can think of little more reductive, repugnant, reckless, or racist crusades as a model figure than indoctrinating your child with an inherent distaste for their own culture**, and nothing more deeply alarming to hear from the mouth of someone born in the 21st century than shit like “Queen was better than any rapper will ever be,” or “real musicianship will die forever with Eric Clapton.” It’s unfair and unnatural: imagine if your high school classmates had consistently turned up their scrunched nose at the living whole of rock & roll, declaring Scott Joplin to be the last musician they could stand.\n\nConsider if the industry-wide customer experience standard for the musical ambiance in 1970s American eating and drinking establishments was entirely comprised of works by John Phillip Souza, and the most prevalent cultural revolution manifested itself something like the following: In countless popular films set in the time (and the stories told today by your parents of their youths that informs them,) a group of popular high school boys – generally three longtime childhood friends and a single addition from the previous summer with an Army Dad and a moderate bad boy aura that’s made him one of the school’s notoriously attractive students and the somewhat-abusive leader in the pack. After spending some time trying to convince the other three (the crucial moment for his case being the bad kid’s rare moment of sincerity trope) of its guaranteed social, sexual and financial ROI, they seal their agreement to start a band with a four-way saliva slap. Imagine if in the progression of this exhausted old tale, it remained entirely classic (and boring) when it faded to a “THREE MONTHS LATER...” ceiling shot of the four the in full, gleaming, performance-spec get-up of the presidential marching band in their garage, and it was revealed that they’d they practiced “The Star Spangled Banner” every night just to make the girls swoon in the film’s resolution with an encore of “America the Beautiful” at an unsanctioned (and very patriotic!) house party.\n\nSuffice it to say that it’s absolutely fucking bonkers how often I encounter “Sweet Home Alabama” (and other tunes I’ve already heard hundreds of times throughout the first third of my existence, conservatively) dripping down from the overhead speakers in all manner of big retail stores, where it’s inappropriate and unwelcome. Even from the generous assumption that every single one of them is an objective masterwork of composition, the amount of affection the American music listening audience has for the same 500 singles is on par with our rampant gun violence in terms of our unanimous tolerance for ridiculously illogical habits. I’ve been sitting in a cute, moderately trendy coffee shop on the corner of the major avenue of access to my cute, moderately trendy Portland neighborhood for an hour now, and I’ve recognized every single one of the tracks played just a bit too loudly on the stereo. I’ve been sick of them all since Middle School. That one Bow Bow Chicka Chicka thing… How very charming. \n\n“*The 70s, the 80s… the one-hit wonder channel!”* \n\nContrary to the popular hipster narrative we’ve just defeated, it’s not the popularity of the lineup that makes these experiences so distasteful, but their *regularity*. It doesn’t take a doctor of psychology to observe that tireless exposure to any given work of art inevitably erodes its value, yet we continue to expend resources saturating most mundane spaces in our society with an unyielding regurgitation of the same brackish pop culture symbols as if we’re *trying* to either induce a canonical vomit, intentionally obliterate the Yelp! reviews for a distant future museum’s “North America Enters the 21st Century” exhibit, or *both*. After failing my best attempts to elaborate with historical analogy citing a past event, I’m afraid we must pivot to a science fiction-esque nanonarrative containing obnoxiously speculative hypotheticals, instead.\n\n**Imagine**: It’s 2036 – four years after we found out we are not alone in the universe when a significantly more advanced civilization makes formal first contact with humanity by sending a party of diplomats, anthropologists, and explorers (who were actually getting ready to go in 2016 before getting word of the Trump presidency and deciding we weren’t quite ready just yet) who land their space egg right in front of the United Nations’ New York City headquarters and expressing something to the tune of *hey so um… we noticed you guys moved in and we just wanted to stop by and say hi*, entirely altering humanity’s self-perception and future trajectory (see: works by Gene Roddenberry) yadda yadda. The visitors expressed a wish to begin a cultural exchange project with us, and it’s just now coming to fruition… I have only moments ago made history in the eyes of the entire world when I walked through the front door of a Target store in suburban New Jersey leading a hovering hyper-intelligent silicon-based sphere of agender mist (roughly comparative to a basketball in size,) who’s already both impressing and shaming me tremendously as we move by the in-store Starbucks. From above us, Semisonic’s “Closing Time” is belched upon my life’s proudest moment and my guest requests we pause to discuss it, to my profound horror.\n\n“The sound from the reproduction devices embedded above us...” the android translator trails off for a moment. “It is the same noise that was distantly reproduced 51 hours ago in ‘Miami’ as I conversed with Ambassador Phillip Defranco about ‘the setting sun’ on the ‘beach,’ coming from a small open air structure which he defined as ‘a surf shop,’ which was occupied by a young male who appeared to be moderately agitated, moving about in jagged strides as he wildly smacked the foundational surface with ‘a broom.’ The Ambassador explained the youth was likely nearing the end of his allotted period of daily occupational labor.”\n\nBlood is flooding my cheeks as I listen with a building dread to the robot’s interpretation, awash with all manner of embarrassment for my species. \n\n“Is the purpose of this noise reproduction of a logistical nature, or is it perhaps a common ritual within business and\/or working class culture?”\n\n<iframe style=\"border: 0; width: 100%; height: 120px;\" src=\"https:\/\/bandcamp.com\/EmbeddedPlayer\/album=2309125545\/size=large\/bgcol=ffffff\/linkcol=00006b\/tracklist=false\/artwork=small\/track=2334991176\/transparent=true\/\" seamless><a href=\"http:\/\/ripswirl.bandcamp.com\/album\/possessed\">Possessed by RIP Swirl<\/a><\/iframe>\n\nNow, it’s your turn to be the human representative in this pico science fiction: you’re now obligated to confirm the alien anthropologist’s hypothesis and explain that “Closing Time” is but one piece of recorded music among billions of diverse expressive works across millennia. You must reverently describe how the “universal language” of math within melodious composition has long been a hefty buzzword in the pop culture conversations about interstellar communication and our longtime search for extraterrestrial intelligence from the future-thrilled 90s—S.E.T.I.’s glory days – when we felt pretty damned good about space. The historic launch of the United Nations’ “greetings on behalf of the people of our planet” etched into [The Golden Record](https:\/\/www.npr.org\/2017\/09\/30\/554489944\/the-voyager-golden-record-finally-finds-an-earthly-audience) aboard *Voyager I* and Jodie Foster’s novel portrayal of a S.E.T.I. scientist in the iconic Carl Sagan-sourced 1997 science fiction drama *Contact* are among the globally-celebrated Best Hits of humanism (not to mention the organization listed on your paystubs,) and they weigh a billion tons on you, now—in the most significant moment of your entire life, bar none – as you explain on behalf of your species to **real** extraterrestrial intelligence the reality of how negligent it is actually is of the culture the Record claimed to treasure. The worst part, though? The entire experience is accompanied by a nasal-as-hell Semisonic soundtrack.\n\nAren’t you *frustrated*? You should be, but it’s not over yet: inevitably, your round fictional companion of note is going to follow up their query with some seriously burning meat.\n\n“Just a half-generation ago, your utopian dream of a globally-connected world – in which everyone would be empowered to saturate and culture themselves with new ideas and forms of expression – was the defining aspiration of your society, and yet you’ve definitively achieved Total Connectivity, now, and caused the overwhelmingly opposite result: you’re all intolerable shitheads who every passing solar orbit become less and less capable of anything but regurgitation of the same foul bullshit. Y’all fucking wack. I’m out. ”\n\nAnd there, that filthy little ball would have us all. Friends, colleagues, human siblings of mine, **it’s long-past time we expect better from ourselves** as music citizens of the world. Even the longest living of us are endowed with very little opportunity to absorb anything more than an infinitesimal fraction of all there is to experience, and we’ve all been carelessly and embarrassingly chucking it to the weeds. If it this all seems excessive, there’s no need to feel attacked, but for Pete’s sake… please stop claiming you “like music” because it’s misleadingly inaccurate and I’ll promise never to use the phrase “music citizens of the world” again, in exchange.\n\n# Distribution & Curation\n\n**You, your friends, and I are missing out on way too much cool shit** and we’re going to continue addressing possible causes and solutions to this ongoing catastrophe without asking for a single moved finger on your part because we are fucking saints. Let’s come back to ground and consider a casual real-world use case for a streaming service which I’ve observed.\n\n*It’s just after 1PM on an especially beautiful Summer day in 2018, and you’ve decided with your two best friends that an impromptu hot dog barbecue in your little apartment’s parking lot would be a great way to spend the afternoon. You get on Facebook Messenger – no time to bother with the formality of creating an event – and begin to bother your group of art school friends. In a few hours, you’ve set up chairs in a circle around the borrowed fire pit, gathered meat tubes, marshmallows, and beer, and your guests have begun to arrive. The next step: retrieve your cordless Bluetooth speaker from inside to place it atop a log nearest the scene, re-pair it with your smartphone, and ___?*\n\nLet’s acknowledge that music has incredibly diverse purposes of value in human life—*of course* I realize this—and ultimately, nobody can dictate those fulfilled for another individual by any given track, album, artist, or genre across time and setting. Even splittercore-obsessed serial killers and body modding cybergrind disciples are doomed: inevitably, they will one day let their guard down and find themselves singing along with “Goodbye Earl” on the radio way off key, smiling like a doofus. Even if one hates humanity, they will eventually be forced to acknowledge that The Dixie Chicks came very close to its penultimate manifestation.\n\nI understand that it’s not *always* time for something new for everyone, but you’re missing out on music’s most worthwhile function by far if you never seek anything fresh, and—if you still find yourself unwilling to bother, even—carrying around even the slightest bit of anecdotal knowledge about *what’s going on* in music with you can be invaluably culturing to your image when socializing with youths and alien intelligences, alike. There is a spectrum of enthusiasm (or pretentiousness, depending on one’s own subjectives) for music that is far more culturally consequential than the practice of partaking and\/or patroning any other artform. Settle comfortably on any point – extreme or not – and you’re at serious risk of being uncool. Nobody wants Anthony Fantano showing up to their party, but if you live too long confusing the Beach Boys with the Beatles – as I have – folks start to behave as if there’s something wrong with you. If it helps, let’s suppose this to be the *real* reason behind my need to discuss Bandcamp – perhaps its relative lack of aged or worshiped-at-scale work justifies it all.\n\nBy this nature, its effort is designed to bracket the enthusiast as wholly as possible, but the value most in need of its experience has become its comparatively extravagant hospitality for the dabbler. The “[Discoverinator](https:\/\/daily.bandcamp.com\/2012\/06\/07\/behold-the-glory-of-the-discoverinator\/)” (I would’ve voted for calling it “Genre-Fucker”) is simply *the* most ingenious tool available anywhere to filter music by genre, subgenre, location, and medium. Or at least... It’s too gorgeous not to be. Thanks to its recent visual redesign, I don’t even care if it’s useful—it’s just a beautiful thing to play with on both the Web and the iOS app (though I’d bet they were each crafted separately.)\n\n<iframe width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/SOaEAR9Da70?controls=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe>\n\nFront and center on the homepage is the [Bandcamp Daily](http:\/\/daily.bandcamp.com\/) – a showcase of features, lists, albums of the day, and artist interviews from various staff and guest contributors which I’d most certainly judge befit of a standalone publication – and the [*Bandcamp Weekly*](https:\/\/bandcamp.com\/?show) – an extraordinarily-produced podcast like no other with special mixes, guest appearances, and commentary which the company’s [Chief Curator Andrew Jervis](https:\/\/bandcamp.com\/andrewjervis) has been honing [since 2013](http:\/\/bandcamp.com\/?show=1) over 289 episodes as of [this morning](http:\/\/bandcamp.com\/?show=289). Its player functions both in-browser and on the iOS app unlike any I’ve ever seen, with a list of embedded tracks that pop out when they’re actually spinning on the show so that you can engage further with them, if you wish. It’s difficult to describe, but it feels visually like you’re listening to a playlist in Bandcamp’s normal player, except tracks are intermixed and faded between one another beneath the host’s commentary, so the audio itself must be pre-rendered. Regardless, it’s nearly as extraordinary an achievement in Web design as the program itself is in curatorial music broadcasting. I’m no addict to the genre, but I have yet to Discover another similar product which I can binge episode after episode for hours without becoming bored or irritated as I can the *Bandcamp Weekly*’s.\n\nTo fill in the parking lot party blank with a single streaming solution for the sake of our young, art school-attending, likely more musically-literate than average summer barbecue guests—how viable is Bandcamp? Truthfully, it’s only slightly more suited now than it was in its earliest infancy for obediently filling a space with ambiance. We could ponder whether or not its design discourages absentminded playback only consequently, or perhaps condescendingly from the high, white tower of hipster elitism on which you’ll occasionally hear it accused of perching, but UX design is *the* most ridiculous sphere within which to intenspeculate in lieu of verification (gazing at you with the timeless grace of a thousand moons, *Medium,*) so lets hold off to seek out an interview with a Bandcamp representative.\n\nSoundCloud would be a bit closer to the mark—it can be configured to simply *keep going* after you’ve finished a track, regardless of where you may be within the interface (excluding the embedded player, of course)—but it’d be much safer to spend the smidgen of extra time required to find a manmade playlist. Letting it loose will quickly land you on some seriously dubious (and probably embarrassing) nerd shit. As I understand it, YouTube has long been the go-to houseparty music player because of its universality, Chromecast support, and (obviously) visual component for accompanying music videos, so its new, ad-free [YouTube Music service](https:\/\/djmag.com\/content\/youtube-launches-youtube-music-and-youtube-premium-streaming-services) has a lot of potential, in theory, but we’re *outside* in this scenario and our smartphone is our only playback device.\n\nStartlingly, the Web’s given best answer to this situation is still Spotify in all of its culture-diluting gluttony. *Internet radio*? Yikes. You can still find a gem of a stream every once in a while, but they’re usually unreliable and probably abandoned, so the catalog won’t last you more than a few hours before you’ll start to hear repeats. You could search out the internet stream of your favorite radio station—a *student* radio station, even—but those offering the most entertaining programming are unlikely to have a suitable playlist on a summer afternoon. So—forgetting its overwhelming financial funneling toward its top 10% and everything else for a moment—why not just give up the pretense and use Spotify? Again, for most of my friends, it works just fine to play Cat Stevens, Run DMC, Gorillaz or The Rolling Stones, but I have yet to figure out a combination of keywords to keep it on target within even the most rudimentary parameters. Such ill-restraint becomes especially dire—necessary, really—when I queue up “Cannibal Ox Radio” for the office and R Kelly ends up playing, 20 minutes in. Using personally-targeted artist bans is probably too subjective to ask of such a service in the spotlight, but **how about an option to filter out white rappers**? (I hope you didn’t blink because that’s by far my best contribution in tech writing yet.)\n\n<iframe style=\"border: 0; width: 100%; height: 120px;\" src=\"https:\/\/bandcamp.com\/EmbeddedPlayer\/album=4014717387\/size=large\/bgcol=ffffff\/linkcol=00006b\/tracklist=false\/artwork=small\/track=2256266207\/transparent=true\/\" seamless><a href=\"http:\/\/openmikeeagle360.bandcamp.com\/album\/brick-body-kids-still-daydream\">Brick Body Kids Still Daydream by Open Mike Eagle<\/a><\/iframe>\n\nThe truth is, I’d probably end up calling upon Apple Music as I’ve been an on-and-off subscriber since its release, but have yet to meet a single fellow user. The girth of its catalog is [reportedly still nearly ](https:\/\/9to5mac.com\/2018\/05\/06\/apple-music-vs-spotify\/)[25% larger](https:\/\/9to5mac.com\/2018\/05\/06\/apple-music-vs-spotify\/), its UI is significantly more cohesively integrated with iOS (which hasn’t always been a given from Apple with its music software, mind you,) yet it costs me precisely the same $9.99 a month as Spotify Premium would. If I *did* know somebody else who used it, they’d be able to see [my public profile](http:\/\/bit.ly\/dbapple) including my playlists and activity, just as my followers on Spotify can, and I can create “Stations” for artists that function similarly to Spotify’s endless adaptive playlists, but—crucially, for myself—after the app’s redesign for iOS 10, the integration of Apple Music music with my own iTunes library is completely seamless. With unlimited data, I’ve selected the option to refrain from storing music locally, which further diminishes the distinction between “my” music and the music I’ve paid for the rights to stream. Fundamentally, the end result is that I pay ten bucks a month for “ownership” of *all* the music on iTunes proper.\n\nWhile I might personally play *Bandcamp Weekly* episodes in such a context and gladly accept whatever results I’d get, I’d only do so acknowledging the subsequently increased risk of some vest-wearing fuck I’ve never met springing out of the bushes to accost me about Weird Allan. However, I am neither cool nor musically literate, which makes me particularly vulnerable to misusing algorithmic Discovery—the practice in which artificial intelligence has become most widely-deployed which continues to prove itself to better deserve the term “automated wallowing,” or “robotized ear rot.”\n\n<iframe style=\"border: 0; width: 100%; height: 120px;\" src=\"https:\/\/bandcamp.com\/EmbeddedPlayer\/album=66639283\/size=large\/bgcol=ffffff\/linkcol=00006b\/tracklist=false\/artwork=small\/track=151662136\/transparent=true\/\" seamless><a href=\"http:\/\/scjreal.bandcamp.com\/album\/watch-a-man-die-3\">WATCH A MAN DIE 3 by SCJ<\/a><\/iframe>\n\nIronically, Damon Krukowski’s aforementioned “responsibility” essay on *Pitchfork* openly cites Liz Pelly’s burning-hot and [100%](https:\/\/thebaffler.com\/salvos\/the-problem-with-muzak-pelly)[ essential analysis](https:\/\/thebaffler.com\/salvos\/the-problem-with-muzak-pelly) of algorithmically-generated playlists for *The Baffler* notes the publication’s own substantial relationship with Spotify, including a [Webby Award-winning](https:\/\/www.webbyawards.com\/winners\/pitchfork-spotify-inside-discovery\/) advertorial series called *Inside Discovery*, which the two collaborate to produce that’s “meant to boost awareness of the ‘Discover Weekly’ feature.”\n\n> The series shows Pitchfork editors (and favored musicians) gushing about their love of streaming—the immediacy! The deep back catalogs! One editor says it helps him keep track of his listening habits, while another rejoices at not having to dig through crates at record shops anymore. Yet another likens Spotify to walking around a music festival, discovering something new at every turn. What does it mean for “the most trusted voice in music” to celebrate an algorithm as preferable to its own crate digging? What does it mean when the tastemaking humans endorse data-driven machines? What does it mean when the algorithms become cool? Virtually every music publication now relies on Spotify media players to embed songs within online articles, and Websites like Pitchfork and Rolling Stone regularly celebrate their playlists with listicles: “Ten Albums To Stream Now.” “The Five Playlists You Need to Hear This Summer.”\n\nWe love bespoke Open Web projects, so exploring *Inside Discovery*’s (surely bespoke) experience induced the same pathetic sort of *I wish business just incentived building nice things* disappointment which has become my default, bitchy mood, and blaming as a further let down to immediately land on [Mitski’s ](https:\/\/insidediscovery.pitchfork.com\/playlist-mitski)[playlist](https:\/\/insidediscovery.pitchfork.com\/playlist-mitski), to whom I’d just been [reintroduced](https:\/\/pitchfork.com\/features\/profile\/dont-cry-for-mitski\/) (by *Pitchfork*, admittedly) after happening upon her performance at Pitchfork 2017 (which is organized, admittedly, by *Pitchfork*.)\n\nUpon a brief review of these once-petty desires and the new, apocalyptic solutions which we are burning barns full of cash to develop, it would appear that the overwhelmingly defining feature of those which are at all viable remains to be the interference of a human being, and why wouldn’t it be, still, when manual music aggregation remains so desperately cheap? I’d wager heavily that there’s at least a single editor within Apple Music who’s spent serious time embedded in the Berlin techno scene considering how regularly the prime “Techno” playlist is updated with new work of a moderately-industrial bias.\n\n“The downside to automated music Discovery is that we’re encouraged to develop a taste profile and stick to it,” [opines somebody on *Pigeons & Planes*](https:\/\/pigeonsandplanes.com\/in-depth\/2016\/03\/music-discovery-algorithms), complimenting Pelly in their profile of former BBC Radio 1 host, Zane Lowe, and his new job curating an Apple Music playlist? \n\nThe truth is, the stories that come to us that smell the strongest of philanthropy on the surface are often actually about some dusty, Y2K-lookin’-ass nerd with powerfully tedious grievances and too much time on their hands. The whole world knows the details by now of how Mark Zuckerberg’s horny social ineptitude led to Facebook’s conception, but we must both keep in check the bad habit we share – the whole present-day reading world and I, that is – of dwelling entirely too much on the most “negative,” soul-agitating tales in what we perceive to be the pursuit of necessary ingredients for concocting a better solution. Bandcamp’s story is predominantly comprised of smart decisions, sincere transparency, and savvy ideas which are best examined in contrast, I’m afraid, with all that’s being done *wrong* everywhere else.\n\n> Are my favorite punk bands now Bandcamp bands? Are they suddenly wanting to conform to a kind of Bandcamp aesthetic? I don’t think so. Not yet. But if that does happen, something might be lost — a sense of these bands defining themselves as they want to, which is sort of the Bandcamp promise in the first place. People can use help navigating the riches of Bandcamp. But its estimable editorial project opens an interesting question: When does help turn into tastemaking?\n\n# The Creators\n\nYou missed it, didn’t you—the ten-year anniversary of Bandcamp’s launch? Ashamed, I realized last month that I did, too. Ashamed, because I owe a lot to to the platform’s unwavering commitment to the distribution and curation of work made by just about all of my favorite artists—within and outside of my social network. Throughout 2015, I hosted a number of conversations with exceptional, future-looking creators on *Drycast* which I am especially proud of. On one [early episode](https:\/\/anchor.fm\/extratone\/episodes\/Juke-Master-Samantha-Carter-and-the-Producers-Extravaganza-e1neqc\/a-a4674c) with an exceptional total of *seven* music makers, I observed in a beat that “all of us have Bandcamp accounts,” before the week’s guest, Samantha Carter, suggested that she’d found her page especially financially rewarding, and originated the concept of the “Bandcamp Sugar Daddy” (which I personally ship 100%.)\n\n<iframe sandbox=\"allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-top-navigation allow-popups allow-forms\" scrolling=no width=\"100%\" height=\"auto\" frameborder=\"0\" src=\"https:\/\/embed.radiopublic.com\/e?if=extratone-radio-WYDa1L&ge=s1!f76e4396345722808b3064eb45ca7053ea92f219\"><\/iframe>\n\n“It's something I take for granted,” said my friend [yzome](https:\/\/twitter.com\/yzome) – a [truly one-of-a-kind electronic producer](https:\/\/yzome.bandcamp.com\/) who’s far-traveling composition is probably the closest Digital Audio Workstation equivalent of Extreme Use Testing—when automotive manufacturers effectively torture new prototypes with the most inhospitable conditions on Earth until they break. However, it’s not a PR stunt in yzome’s case—he’s just very good at doing what he does after doing it for nearly 10 years—and his end product requires a hell of a lot more than any one genre would ever presume, but it more than delivers back on the investment with significant interest.\n\nWhen [he appeared on *Drycast*](https:\/\/anchor.fm\/extratone\/episodes\/Electronic-Producer-Yzome-and-his-Alien-Sound-e1lmcj\/a-a41qc5) in January 2015, we failed to achieve any descriptors more sophisticated than “alien sounds,” but perhaps that’s all they need: the inner worlds into which yzome invites us are of manic, unpredictable arrhythmia which poses an unapologetic, yet magically lighthearted challenge to any cohesive theory. It’s very rare that his proudly-ungenreable exploration of the fringes does not demand the listener’s full attention, yet it always manages to be *inoffensively aggressive* like **nothing** else, which suggesting promise for the possible upheaval of a long-upheld natural law among electronic dance music: yzome doesn’t need to be a shithead to challenge the listener intellectually.\n\n<iframe style=\"border: 0; width: 100%; height: 120px;\" src=\"https:\/\/bandcamp.com\/EmbeddedPlayer\/album=586326190\/size=large\/bgcol=ffffff\/linkcol=00006b\/tracklist=false\/artwork=small\/track=641807133\/transparent=true\/\" seamless><a href=\"http:\/\/yzome.bandcamp.com\/album\/yvette\">YVETTE by yzome<\/a><\/iframe>\n\nPlay *[YVETTE](https:\/\/yzome.bandcamp.com\/album\/yvette)* for any boomer you know with that classically impenetrable disgust for *all* electronic music, and you’ll witness firsthand how special yzome’s particular innovation truly is. No, they’re not going to be *sexually liberated*, or anything—it’s still going to be alarming—but you’ll notice that the swift and overwhelming fury which sample and break-heavy dance music has always awoken within them has been miraculously circumvented. Instead of immediately storming off, they’ll be paralyzed in an existential fugue state from which they may never quite fully emerge. I’ve seen it firsthand. It’s witchcraft.\n\nThere is no other across the (especially-wide) electronic spectrum who can so loudly go so far, so fast without any insincerity, whatsoever. His arrangement seems mischievous and all over the place, but really listen and you’ll hear rips of recognizable patterns playing peekaboo in willy-nilly bursts that reveal his dynamic mastery of the dance music space through Breakcore, Juke, Footwork, and Techno sampling. All of this is to say, really, that yzome’s music represents a level of boundary-pushing which only a niche audience tends to truly appreciate, yet is undoubtedly worthy of an elegantly-presented host like Bandcamp.\n\n\"Like thank god I don't have to look for a label to release this. It's seen as a legitimate platform (by people who might actually care about what I’m doing, at least,) which I think is less offputting than uploading things to Mediafire or whatever else. It’s populist and boutique at the same time.\"\n\n***Populist, yet boutique***. Can we really be expected to exceed this summation? Well, nobody’s said much at all in the mainstream press, but what *has* been said is 1) unusually misplaced in the spaces of those least likely to find it relevant and 2) *way* more insightful than you’d expect. \n\n“Bandcamp has an independent-artist identity because of practicalities: Independent artists from Web-centered subcultures need it most,” observed an especially savvy online aside from by [Ben Ratliff](http:\/\/benratliff.net\/)—jazz and pop critic for *The New York Times—*asking “[Is Bandcamp the Holy Grail of Online Record Stores](https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2016\/08\/20\/arts\/music\/bandcamp-shopping-for-music.html)?” So why aren’t we talking about it? The other important takeaway: founder Ethan Diamond told Ratliff that “the company has never spent money on promotion.” This is largely why I’ve invested so much time and affection into this piece—gratitude is not often sellable incentive for mainstream coverage. \n\nThe truth is, the continued obscurity of Bandcamp’s story despite all it’s done comes down not to any malpractice by the company (in fact, it would likely be more visible had it fucked up more,) or even to its prevalence in the careers of big industry names (whom I will address in detail shortly,) but because it simply operates too magnanimously for its customers to be taken seriously as a newsworthy business, which is problematic and personally infuriating. In November, 2015, Bandcamp made mention in *The New Yorker* via the openly diminutive context of *Car Seat Headrest’s* [origin story](https:\/\/www.newyorker.com\/magazine\/2015\/11\/02\/growth-spurt-pop-music-hua-hsu), describing it as “a charming alternative,” and “a casual, low-risk approach.” Granted, it’s worth noting that the platform did not address its lack of “editorial guidance” until a year later, with the [launch](https:\/\/daily.bandcamp.com\/2016\/06\/13\/welcome-to-bandcamp-daily\/) of the excellent *Bandcamp Daily* blog, but I think you’ll agree it’s in poor taste to argue against the legitimacy of a *music* distribution platform because it’s *too democratic.* Perhaps it’s still just beyond reasonable expectations to get a top-of-the-foodchain music writer’s head wrapped around the idea that such products on The Internet can easily—even optimally—service both hobbyists and professionals.\n\nLast year, Bandcamp was responsible for [$270 million in payments](https:\/\/daily.bandcamp.com\/2018\/02\/12\/the-bandcamp-2017-year-in-review\/) to artists like Jlin,the genius commonly associated with Footwork (certainly Chicago’s most underreported and popularly underrepresented movement,) for pushing its expressive boundaries both in theory and geography further than any other, and who’s so far produced two of the most “[aggressively](https:\/\/noisey.vice.com\/en_us\/article\/qvv37m\/jlin-is-making-the-most-aggressively-beautiful-music-youve-ever-heard)[ beautiful](https:\/\/noisey.vice.com\/en_us\/article\/qvv37m\/jlin-is-making-the-most-aggressively-beautiful-music-youve-ever-heard)” records you’ll find anywhere in the process.[[i\\]](#_edn1) Type her name into any search engine and her Bandcamp page is *always* the first result, yet Cntrl-Fing for “Bandcamp” will yield 0 results from her interviews with *The Fader*, *FACT Magazine*, *Pitchfork*, *The Seventh Hex*, *Passion of the Weiss*, *PopMatters*, *Crack Magazine*, *DUMMY*, *The Guardian*, *The Quietus*, *BOMB Magazine*, *Ableton Blog*, *The Creative Independent*, *Rolling Stone*, *SPIN*, *No Fear of Pop*, *self-titled magazine*, *Circulation Magazine*, *The New Yorker*, *Cyclic Defrost*, *Mixmag*, or *melting bot*, and only one in *Interview Magazine*. To be clear: I am **not** arguing that Jlin—a black female music artist—should be profusely thanking Bandcamp—a service founded largely by white male programmers—for hosting her most visible page but rather that the more independent of these publications, especially, should mention its role in her story or—at the very least—be hyperlinking to [her Bandcamp page](https:\/\/jlin.bandcamp.com\/) first, for both her’s and their readers’ sake—Bandcamp’s cut of album purchases is half of iTunes. From the user experience perspective, it’s absurd that those of these pages including embedded music players chose to use SoundCloud’s—which is more resource heavy (yet of noticeably lesser streaming playback quality) and visually disruptive—instead of [Bandcamp’s](https:\/\/daily.bandcamp.com\/2013\/06\/12\/all-new-players-up-twitter-too\/).\n\n<iframe style=\"border: 0; width: auto; height: auto;\" src=\"https:\/\/bandcamp.com\/EmbeddedPlayer\/album=2765736108\/size=large\/bgcol=ffffff\/linkcol=00006b\/tracklist=false\/transparent=true\/\" seamless><a href=\"http:\/\/jlin.bandcamp.com\/album\/black-origami\">Black Origami by Jlin<\/a><\/iframe>\n\nThe two services were launched the same year—that fateful 2008—but comparing them is complicated. They are clear opposites in at least one principal: how they’ve defined their mission. Bandcamp has changed less throughout its history than any other Web service that comes to mind (see below,) but SoundCloud has struggled with identity issues, to their vastly-superior success (in terms of user statistics, anyway.) *The New York Times* [reported in June, 2011](https:\/\/bits.blogs.nytimes.com\/2011\/06\/15\/soundcloud-an-audio-sharing-site-hits-5-million-users\/) that they’d reached 5 million users, citing their decision to expand focus beyond “popular music” to explain the milestone. “We’re building a sound platform that’s not just about music,” said Alex Ljung – a SoundCloud co-founder and the company’s chief executive at the time – and its present landscape certainly reflects a diverse offering of uses, but ultimately, any . Today, both SoundCloud and Bandcamp have premium subscription plans for artists which are at least *perceived* to be competitive with one another—[SoundCloud Pro](https:\/\/blog.soundcloud.com\/2013\/03\/11\/introducing-soundcloud-pro\/) and [Bandcamp Pro](https:\/\/daily.bandcamp.com\/2012\/06\/25\/new-features-up\/), respectively—along with free base experiences, which we’ll compare first.\n\n**Free Bandcamp Account\n Uploads**: quantity unlimited, size of each file limited to 291mb.\n **Distribution**: unlimited streaming, up to 200 free downloads per month.\n\n**Free SoundCloud Account\n Uploads**: total of 3 hours uploaded at any given time.\n **Distribution**: unlimited streaming, unlimited downloads.\n\nBoth offer access “basic” statistics for their tracks at this tier which most of the creators I know consider more than enough—the usefulness of any playback\/download stats is negligible when you’re publishing within tight niches—and each has had about 5 years to fine-tune their free offerings so that they feel as complete as possible. If you’re planning on publishing a podcast on SoundCloud, you’re obviously going to have to upgrade your upload limit even beyond Pro ($8\/month, 6-hour upload limit) to Pro Unlimited ($16\/month, unlimited uploads,) though I would suggest a plethora of alternative methods before you got that far. Unfortunately, they would not include a free Bandcamp account. While [there ](https:\/\/bandcamp.com\/?g=podcasts&s=top&p=0&gn=0&f=all&w=0#discover)*are* [podcasts on Bandcamp](https:\/\/bandcamp.com\/?g=podcasts&s=top&p=0&gn=0&f=all&w=0#discover), they’re completely separate the platform’s aspirations and without support for the basic requirements of podcast distribution (namely, RSS feeds.)\n\nBandcamp’s Pro option is $10 a month and includes a custom domain, batch file uploading, private streaming (for press and\/or fans) plus the ability to disable *free* streaming (requiring listeners to actually buy the music to enable any playback,) ad-free video hosting (which nobody uses, to my knowledge,) extended fan interaction tools, and a broader statistics suite that includes Google Analytics support. SoundCloud’s Pro and Pro Unlimited options are complimentary, but a full-time independent artist could justify maintaining Pro accounts on both services or neither—one does not necessarily replace the other, but the contrast in their chosen presentations has led to a divide in the cultures of the two communities so stark [it could be a punchline](http:\/\/www.thefader.com\/2017\/04\/03\/bandcamp-artists-vs-soundcloud-artists-meme) and\/or simplified to say that *SoundCloud is for rap* and *Bandcamp is not*.\n\nIt’s not entirely shocking, then, that SoundCloud’s story has been more present in the greater conversation than Bandcamp’s. Frankly, its largest issues are directly related: compared to SoundCloud, **Bandcamp’s community is White As Fuck** (a claim I can only make on behalf of my own observations and those which a select few creators have seen fit to express to me over the years, considering that the company has yet to release any demographic information about its creators) which is a glaringly fundamental obstruction to the project’s broader mission to help music culture “[thrive](https:\/\/bandcamp.com\/about).”\n\nFrom a future historian’s perspective, the battle for the definitive name in independent digital music distribution has already won, largely thanks to its relationship with Chance The Rapper, who’s quickly become a “cultural influencer, thought leader, global star,” and one of my generation’s upmost celebrity champions. Obviously, there is little sense trying to determine whether SoundCloud *earned* his partnership or landed their popular association with his name as long as the artist maintains it publicly, while continuing to [give new meaning](https:\/\/soundcloud.com\/pitchfork\/pitchfork-presents-in-sight-out-chance-the-rapper) to the phrase “serially likable.” Thus far, his mythical power to exude purity has felt virtually 100% airtight Last year, his second album *Coloring Book* made history when it won the [first streaming-only ](https:\/\/www.engadget.com\/2017\/02\/12\/chance-the-rapper-first-streaming-only-grammy\/)[Grammy for Best Album](https:\/\/www.engadget.com\/2017\/02\/12\/chance-the-rapper-first-streaming-only-grammy\/). In my personal favorite moment in recent popular culture memory, the fashionable-as-hell young man [accepted the accolade](https:\/\/youtu.be\/FkAJ_BU66Zs) by looking the whole industry establishment in the face and proclaiming “this is for every indie artist—everybody who’s been doin’ this mixtape shhhh...*tuff* for a long ass time... shouts out to every independent artist out there; [shouts out to SoundCloud for holding me down](https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2017\/2\/12\/14594672\/chance-the-rapper-grammy-awards-2017-soundcloud).” Obviously, such significant, sentimental, and sincere sentiments are *never* expressed about tech companies by beloved darlings of the art world like Chance—especially not for Earth-encompassing awards show audiences.\n\nAfter [last year’s massive layoff](https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2017\/7\/6\/15928674\/soundcloud-cuts-40-percent-staff), it was [Chance’s assurances](https:\/\/twitter.com\/chancetherapper\/status\/885921220759355397) that “SoundCloud is here to stay” which the public took to heart. Even if the company *is* destined to fail within the next year (it appears to be as yet missing much of a verdict,) and it’s all still destined to fold at any moment, at least it’ll have the distinct pride of doing so having maintained his publicly-expressed respect and confidence, which is a damned fine legacy in my book. Meanwhile, Bandcamp has only made a few small tweaks to its basic infrastructure, and added new features very deliberately, which haven’t resulted in a single memorable controversy. Aside from [Amanda Palmer](https:\/\/www.pastemagazine.com\/articles\/2010\/07\/amanda-palmer-sells-15k-on-bandcampin-three-minute.html), perhaps, there has never been a single band or artist who’ve been known as “from Bandcamp,” leaving our only pitch to be something like *Independent Online Music Platform on Track to Complete 10th Year Serving Small-Time Artists, Continues to Look Pretty Good*.\n\n<iframe style=\"border: 0; width: 100%; height: 120px;\" src=\"https:\/\/bandcamp.com\/EmbeddedPlayer\/track=3566748126\/size=large\/bgcol=ffffff\/linkcol=00006b\/tracklist=false\/artwork=small\/transparent=true\/\" seamless><a href=\"http:\/\/hjkl-8901.bandcamp.com\/track\/every-fat-bee-is-my-girlfriend-2\">Every Fat Bee is my Girlfriend by Sophiaaaahjkl;8901<\/a><\/iframe>\n\n![Ethan Diamond Interview](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/40lCLdW.png)\n\nConsidering the significance of these contributions, it’s of a special wonder that they were made not by a non-profit organization, academic movement, or government endowment, but by a for-profit, California-based tech company that’s continued to thrive and innovate great content, entirely apart from mainstream coverage.\n\n<iframe style=\"border: 0; width: 100%; height: 120px;\" src=\"https:\/\/bandcamp.com\/EmbeddedPlayer\/album=2740417608\/size=large\/bgcol=ffffff\/linkcol=00006b\/tracklist=false\/artwork=small\/track=3333840591\/transparent=true\/\" seamless><a href=\"http:\/\/friendzone.bandcamp.com\/album\/while-u-wait-ep\">While U Wait EP by FRIENDZONE<\/a><\/iframe>\n\n# The Future\n\nIt might seem a bit much on the surface, but in many ways, Bandcamp has spent the past 10 years showing us what a for-profit, Web-based, culturally-edging independent platform Can be, even in the Valley.\n\nThough Bandcamp has embarked upon unusually sparse explanation of its editorial directive in the *Daily* blog and *Weekly* podcast, but regularly consume either for any length of time, and you’ll notice a particular savvy for Discovering technically-progressive Afrocentric projects: “[Black Experimental Music](https:\/\/daily.bandcamp.com\/2016\/08\/05\/a-guide-to-black-experimental-music\/).”\n\nOn [last week’s episode](https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2018\/07\/19\/podcasts\/still-processing-tin-house-inclusion-hannah-gadsby.html) of the excellent *New York Times* podcast *Still Processing*, co-host Jena Wortham “I’m thinking a lot about ways in which new culture, new cultural products, new cultural creators come to light in ways that sidestep these traditional means and don’t have to go through the traditionally very white, very male, very cis, very hetero hoops to prove worthiness.”\n\nSo, our greatest hope for the decentralization of the music industry in the 1990s ended up transforming before us to become the most effectively divisive Discovery barrier ever known to man because of its psychological influence sub-threshold at unprecedented scale over time, in parallel with so many other like horrific monstrosities we’ve discovered in anguish to be mutants of those final salvations from our atrocious history which we’d been so relieved to believe in. Surely, the turn of the millennia was destined to be our final turning point – the moment we’d finally use our new technology to discover a truth (or maybe just a really good clue,) that’d immediately unite our species in a deafening, worldwide aha moment when it would reveal a general abstract of whatever the fuck our deal was that was preventing our silent, dutiful, and 100% harmonious collective effort toward a utopia like *Star Trek: The Next Generation*’s, in which anyone is absolutely free of obligation or desperation from birth to pursue… whatever with their time.\n\n🗎 [**PRINT\/PDF**](https:\/\/documentcloud.adobe.com\/link\/review?uri=urn:aaid:scds:US:1169e93e-e474-4772-9092-9b342e5de5e6)\n\n#software #music","views":4058,"updated":"2022-04-04T08:03:11Z","tags":["software","music","_edn1"],"type":null,"title":"Bandcamp: Streaming's Secret Savior","slug":"bandcamp-streaming-music","appearance":"norm","language":"en","rtl":false,"created":"2018-07-21T19:30:14Z","images":["https:\/\/i.snap.as\/toF3UAy.jpg","https:\/\/i.snap.as\/96z3H8C.png","https:\/\/i.snap.as\/40lCLdW.png"],"collection":{"public":false,"alias":"bilge","total_posts":0,"title":"The Psalms","verification_link":"","description":"A <a href=\"https:\/\/davidblue.wtf\/db.vcf\">narcoleptic yokel<\/a> on software and culture.","style_sheet":"","views":177027,"monetization_pointer":""},"paid":false},{"id":"l6e4uxm60w6ge76f","body":"![Extratone Radio](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/lBCNqyG.png)\n\nhttps:\/\/open.spotify.com\/episode\/77t4NP5umZs5pdSd92iMXZ\n\n## From footwork to the history of dirigibles; from ancient mythology to the puny Silicon Valley Gods — Extratone Radio draws from our varied voices to deliver to the curious the most entertaining sounds around.\n\n<!--more-->\n\n* [APPLE PODCASTS](http:\/\/bit.ly\/extrapple)\n* [ANCHOR](http:\/\/anchor.fm\/extratone)\n* [SPOTIFY](http:\/\/bit.ly\/extrspotify)\n* [BREAKER ](https:\/\/www.breaker.audio\/extratone\\*radio)\n* [CASTBOX](http:\/\/castbox.fm\/channel\/id1347882)\n* [GOOGLE PODCASTS](https:\/\/www.google.com\/podcasts?feed=aHR0cHM6Ly9hbmNob3IuZm0vcy85YTlmOTgvcG9kY2FzdC9yc3M=)\n* [POCKET CASTS](https:\/\/pca.st\/1FXa)\n* [RADIOPUBLIC](https:\/\/play.radiopublic.com\/extratone\\*radio\\*WYDa1L)\n* [STITCHER](https:\/\/www.stitcher.com\/podcast\/anchor\\*podcasts\/extratone\\*radio)","views":3210,"updated":"2021-11-13T09:26:38Z","tags":[],"type":null,"title":"Radio","slug":"radio","appearance":"wrap","language":"en","rtl":false,"created":"2018-07-26T09:00:00Z","images":["https:\/\/i.snap.as\/lBCNqyG.png"],"collection":{"public":false,"alias":"extratone","total_posts":0,"title":"Extratone","verification_link":"","description":"For the New Curious.","style_sheet":"","views":182661,"monetization_pointer":""},"paid":false},{"id":"m7ttfpa9w5ysi69p","body":"![Compaq Logo BANG](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/6iUt6P6.png)\n\n## Setting out upon a desperate personal journey to rediscover enchantment with computers.\n\n<!--more-->\n\nThis evening, a pack­age is sched­uled to arrive upon my doorstep con­tain­ing a Com­paq Portable Plus lug­gable com­put­er from 1983 which I have fan­ta­sized about buy­ing for far too many years.

When used in accordance with its associated documentation, each of the SmartSuite programs is capable of correctly processing, providing and\/or receiving date data within and between the 20th and 21st centuries, provided that all products (for example, hardware, software and firmware) used with the program properly exchange accurate date data with it.\n\n**A little background information**  \nIn the past, you have probably entered a 2-digit number to represent the year in a date with the assumption that the year would fall between 1900 and 1999. For example, 4\/10\/02 was in 1902 and 5\/8\/47 was in 1947.\n\nWith the change to the year 2000, you should be aware that computer programs may now interpret dates you enter with 2-digit years to be in the 20th or the 21st century depending on the method the program uses to define a 2-digit year.\n\nSmartSuite programs use a sliding (rolling) window method to determine the year when you enter only 2 digits to represent the year in a date.\n\n**Notes**\n\n- You can enter the year as 4 digits to make sure you get the results you want. For example, enter 1916 or 2016 instead of 16 for the year.\n- Although you can change how a program displays a date by selecting different date formats, the program stores a constant value for the date no matter how you choose to display it.\n\n**What is the sliding window method?**  \nIn SmartSuite, the sliding window method defines a window of 100 years around the current year (determined by the system date on your computer). When you enter a 2-digit year, the program compares the 2 digits you entered with the years that fall within this 100 year window.  \nFor example, entering 25 for the year might be interpreted as 1925 but 04 might mean the year 2004.\n\nThe years that mark the beginning and end of this window are defined by where the program splits the window with the current year.  \nBy default, 1-2-3, Approach, Freelance Graphics, Organizer, and Word Pro use an 80\/20 rule for this sliding window -- the window begins 80 years before and ends 19 years after the current year.\n\n**How does the 80\/20 rule work?**  \nSuppose the current year is 1999. Using the 80\/20 rule, a window spanning 100 years includes the years 1919 to 2018.\n\nIn 1999, any 2-digit year you enter from 19 to 99 will equal years from 1919 to 1999. Any 2-digit year you enter from 00 to 18 will equal years from 2000 to 2018. If you want to enter a date before 1919 or after 2018, you must enter 4 digits for the year.  \nFor example, assume that the current year is 1999. \n• If you enter 4\/2\/19, the year will be 1919. \n• If you enter 4\/2\/72, the year will be 1972. \n• If you enter 4\/2\/00, the year will be 2000. \n• If you enter 4\/2\/17, the year will be 2017. \n• If you enter 4\/2\/1917, the year will be 1917. \nEvery year this 100 year window moves (slides) forward one year. Under the 80\/20 rule, when the year changes to 2000, the window will include the years 1920 to 2019. When the year changes to 2001, the window will include the years 1921 to 2020, and so on.\n\n**How do you change the 80\/20 default?**  \nThe 80\/20 default for SmartSuite is set through a single entry in the Windows registry. You can change this registry entry using the sample scripts available on the Web (www.lotus.com\/smartsuitedev) and in the \\\\Extra directory on the CD version of Lotus SmartSuite.  \n**Caution** Changing the default changes it for all of the programs in SmartSuite.\n\n**How do SmartSuite programs store dates?**  \nAll the SmartSuite programs store date values with the fully qualified year. Therefore, dates already stored in files are not affected by the sliding window. The sliding window is used to interpret a date when you enter it using 2 digits to represent the year.  \n**Caution** If years are stored as separate values in a file, and scripts or macros interpret these dates as they run, the sliding window rules will apply to those values when only 2 digits are stored for the year.\n\n**For 1-2-3 users only**  \nYou can turn off the 80\/20 sliding window in 1-2-3 by changing the date settings in the 1-2-3 Preferences dialog box. You can also display all dates with 4-digit years. For more information on 1-2-3 and the year 2000, open Help in 1-2-3 and search on Year 2000 in the Help Index.\n\n**Notice**  \n**The information regarding the Year 2000 readiness of Lotus products is provided for informational purposes only and is not a warranty or an extension or modification to the terms of any applicable warranty.

Fight me.*\n\n<!--more-->\n\nYesterday, I finished moving out of the situation I’d been living in for ~6 weeks in the basement of a southeast Portland home near the western base of Mt. Tabor. You'd see it just across from the flat Washington Mall-ish grass rectangle that provides daring suburban explorers their most worthwhile reward for reaching the top. It resembles one of many local residential templates which I was completely unequipped to understand when I arrived in the area last year. You'll never observe any of its inhabitants outside doing any of the things people do when they are unaware of - or unconcerned with being observed. Walking by an afternoon front yard “family gathering” (young white parents and their one or two children) is a prospect of haste. Introducing new movement to the vicinity after the sun has gone down stirs a disruption from deep within its energy. Everyone in this town is afraid. I say it’s an unnatural way to live, but I’m just a fucking bumpkin.\n\nAs you may or may not have observed, the vast majority of my working being lives on the World Wide Web, which requires, fundamentally…. An internet connection. In most any other present-day first world circumstance, these are infinitely available, but I discovered – after the moving process was entirely completed, of course – that my tenants did **not** actually have an in-house connection of their own. They explained to me that their neighbor – an “IT professional” for IBM – had offered to let them use *his* WiFi network, and they’d found the arrangement sufficient. However, because IBM is *The* archaic marque of digital fascism (disclosure: they are also my [sworn blood enemy](http:\/\/bilge.world\/compaq),) it wasn’t altogether a surprise when they told me that his offer did not extend to “guests.”\n\nI considered that a defined period of WiFi fasting at home could make for an interesting experiment - perhaps even a needed mental reset - and I couldn't reasonably afford to acquire my own dedicated 4G hotspot, anyway. The reality became a relentless paranoid battle for any trickle of access - sometimes for *a dozen bytes per second*; for just the most basic digital communications like SMS and email - which led to more superstitious hypotheses about precarious antenna orientation, progress bar hallucinations, out-of-control frustration, and hopeless fixation with refresh commands than I remember from 2nd generation cell networks in the Midwest, 10 years ago, or even domestic dial-up, and truly revealed the extent to which I'd taken connectivity for granted.\n\nhttps:\/\/open.spotify.com\/episode\/7wa3Ce5oJ2TNYkuknFx3s4?si=aTXoGD-SSF-Cn_HJvHFglA\n\nMy observations of my own behavior throughout this drought are worth more than their mild amusement: even this petty disparity (I was never more than two or three yards from nearly-whole signal at the top of the outside stairs) re-sensitized my perspective to the abstract concept of network unreliability which I'd been entirely spared since prepubescence. Though 4 billion human beings now regularly interact with the World Wide Web, their connections span a mathematically gargantuan spectrum of speed and reliability. In urbanizing myself as an adult, I have unconsciously latched on to the entitled ideal that internet access is a public service and accepted dramatically-increasing dependence on services that engorge greater and greater volumes of bandwidth without any explanation but their lack of incentives for efficiency. I reflect on my relationship with technology every day, yet I still became an oblivious data glutton in mind-bogglingly little time.\n\nThe current state of connectivity in the United States, alone is quite alarming under 5-year-absent examination. Mobile carriers are [*still* merging](https:\/\/www.reuters.com\/article\/us-sprint-corp-m-a-t-mobile-us\/t-mobile-runs-behind-the-scenes-pr-push-to-support-sprint-deal-idUSKCN1L512A) and the compartmentalization of *all* ISP customers between prioritization tiers continues to be tested, [less encumbered by regulatory safeguards](https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2018\/9\/24\/17882842\/us-internet-broadband-map-isp-fcc-wireless-competition) than ever. I don't know my politics on this issue, nor do I have any specific solutions, but I'd point to the work of the [National Digital Inclusion Alliance](http:\/\/digitalinclusion.org\/), and express only that I hope the pace of the technology's progress is greater than the growth of its merchants' imaginations and the scope of their greed so that the sheer volume of plenty overcomes even the shortest-sighted, and humanity as a whole continues toward a more just distribution of connectivity. What I *am* in a position to share are the revelations about our current infrastructure, software services, and hardware devices I could only have discovered from such an experience.\n\n## Variables\n\nI remember standing on top of a John Deere combine's 15ft-high roof in order to successfully make a telephone call 10 years ago - one of thousands of behaviors which were more abruptly and universally required for a few years and subsequently more abruptly forgotten than any other such united tick in American history. This blip of shared technological adversity also led to an unfathomably vast collective mythology surrounding incredibly tedious manipulation of our archaic handsets in varying degrees of desperation for *just one bar*.\n\nMy Sprint plan includes unlimited 4G LTE data for [my iPhone 8 Plus](https:\/\/bilge.world\/iphone-8-plus-review) with a 10GB tethering limit - which performed so admirably in the lonely role of my thin tether to the rest of the world that I am obligated to actually use the phrase ***like a champ***, but the quality of its connection is dramatically impacted by the studio apartment's depth. From the space's geometric center at stomach-level, the handset indicates \"1x,\" meaning CDMA 1x, which *is* technically a data connection, but certainly not in any usable sense for the network applications of 2018. The native Twitter app, Apple Mail, Snapchat, Instagram & Facebook, Safari, Opera Mini, Firefox, Chrome, and all others I tested in this condition would simply timeout – giving up after a minute or two of repeated attempts before declining to continue, each in their own minor variations. An interesting anecdote: in a pertinent reflection our human ballooning expectations for connectivity at all times, the language of our creations across both iOS and desktop applications has recently become noticeably less accountable and more accusatory. Instead of saying “____ can’t connect to the internet,” many of the browsers will declare an absolute: *there is no internet connection*, or just straight up **blame** the user: “*you* are not connected to the internet.\" (Emphasis mine.) No apologies... No regrets.\n\n`Dude, no wifi? Where the fuck are U?`\n\nDirectly above my head’s place on the bed, the phone could be propped on the sill of the East-facing window on a clear-skied day, enabling it to scrounge up and loosely establish enough contact to receive calls and text messages, claiming 1-4 3G “bars,” and a single in 4G at night, though one overcast Northwestern week basically did it in completely. If we were actually doing something to noticeably increase our old Nokia boxes’ bandwidth bids on those early networks by turning them every which way to find “better reception,” it’s completely futile on current devices. (I’m fairly sure I remember a network professional explaining this to me when LTE was first gaining traction.) It was immediately apparent that orientation had no effect, but the handset’s bearing certainly did… Most sensitively so. I realized quite early on that I should endeavor not to spend too much time standing in different positions throughout the space attempting to will on a browser loader bar above a story I’ve probably read already. Intstead, I committed to the very first position that indicated any correlation whatsoever with a better connection: atop the biscuit tin on the metal rack nearest the outside door.\n\nIt’s been three months, but I’m still using my tired old Hewlett-Packard 6930p [backup machine](http:\/\/bilge.world\/linux-bitch\/), so I was very skeptical about the odds we’d be successfully reliably pairing its ancient network adapter – [now worth just $9.99](http:\/\/a.co\/d\/ij9mfeD) – with that of A Cellular Phone 10 years its junior without struggling significantly with range or reliability, especially considering that it cannot run a single one of its [vast library of proprietary drivers](https:\/\/support.hp.com\/us-en\/document\/c01538039) on Linux. You’d at least assume they’d need to be practically touching each other to maintain a smooth marriage, yet the only compromise I had to make on the local end was to bring them near to each other as they paired. Afterwards, I could return the phone to its tin and work on the laptop from the kitchen table, 12-15 feet away. (Curiously enough, the 6930p itself shipped with hotspot capability by way of the SIM card slot behind the unit’s main battery.)\n\nQuantifying the speed of a mobile data connection as you would a dedicated WiFi network is incongruent because the former trades in a much less consistent packet stream. That’s the extent of my knowledge, but it’s easy to visualize: a signal that can travel a mile or two in big globules bound to be intercepted in splashes upon the device’s little antennae, versus your home network’s local, evenly distributed sauna of irradiated mist. It’s much less definite, to say the least, and I can’t actually comprehend the sort of voodoo that’s required in order to expand and maintain the networks as they are, nor would I ever wish to burden myself with such knowledge.\n\n<!--comment-->\n\n#software","views":1072,"updated":"2023-05-13T23:04:16Z","tags":["software"],"type":null,"title":"Revelations in Web Starvation","slug":"bad-connection-insights","appearance":"norm","language":"en","rtl":false,"created":"2018-10-14T20:00:00Z","images":["https:\/\/i.snap.as\/9wsQDXz.png"],"collection":{"public":false,"alias":"bilge","total_posts":0,"title":"The Psalms","verification_link":"","description":"A <a href=\"https:\/\/davidblue.wtf\/db.vcf\">narcoleptic yokel<\/a> on software and culture.","style_sheet":"","views":177027,"monetization_pointer":""},"paid":false},{"id":"03ep3edizbio93t3","body":"![Indie Folk Battery Burglary](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/GewgcRj.jpg)\n\n<!--more-->\n\nI have to just ***fucking do it*** — I’m going to start writing about music in this space. There’s virtually zero chance that I’ll shout over other voices of music criticism as long as *Bilge* remains so poorly optimized for SEO, and Portland, Oregon has been far too confusing to deprive myself the opportunity to work out *any* understanding of its youth culture. It’s not a lack of talented musicians in the area — the opposite is true — but a severe drought of the kind of tragedy and trauma which ultimately give acoustic American musical expression *its whole shit*. What I caught of the weekend’s invasion with Santa Cruz musicians were all praiseworthy, tight and confident performers who’d obviously invested heavily in their equipment and their presence here. [Joe Kaplow](https:\/\/joekaplow.bandcamp.com\/) arrived with a sort of bespoke magazine rack containing 20 neatly-arranged effect pedals, leading me to wonder for a moment if I was about to witness *banjo powerviolence* for the first time, but he explained that he simply preferred their availability, and wouldn’t use “more than a few at once,” and seemed almost genuinely perturbed by my attempt to explain the specific industrially-influenced involvement of audio hardware in hardcore punk and grind performance which I was referring to with the term. (“Powerviolence” has apparently become an ambiguous one around these parts, and I’m sure he was actually just *utterly uninterested*.)\n\n![Indie Folk Battery Burglary](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/2vEevFd.jpg)\n\n![Indie Folk Battery Burglary](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/hwDHYHy.jpg)\n\nNo more than two dozen guests made up their peak crowd of witnesses, yet Joe and his band certainly made good on shear effort expended in laying down a hearty, back-to-back recital for us at an unusually protracted rate, though apparently either they, the [Getaway Dogs](https:\/\/getawaydogs.bandcamp.com\/), or [The Curfews](https:\/\/thecurfews.bandcamp.com\/) had insisted that a “cover charge” be collected at the door of the house show. It’s not my business to to dwell on or attempt to investigate an unsubstantiatable rumor, but I understand this could have been a breach of house show etiquette. What I *do* know is that one of the visiting musicians stole 4 flat AA batteries out of my [COOLPIX](https:\/\/flic.kr\/s\/aHsmqBwfDZ) and *apparently* attempted to jack its ancient Compact Flash card, which is only hilarious because they didn’t succeed. Regardless, it should be said that Joe Kaplow’s songwriting is more flattered by [Indie mags](https:\/\/glidemagazine.com\/209034\/song-premiere-folk-singer-joe-kaplow-searches-for-sense-of-home-with-i-said-i-was-going-and-i-went\/) than my own ears, though one still wishes for a more substantive topic than “I thought it’d be cool make a corn cob pipe, so I did.” Then again, much of what you’ll find at this URL reads a lot like “I thought it’d be interesting to make a WordPress blog, so I did.” White people have truly run out of shit to say, haven’t we?\n\n> The inspiration that sparked ‘I Said’ moved me like a puppet. So much so that I had to pull over at the top of Altamont Pass, by the huge windmills, and write the song in the back of my van. \n>\n> Joe Kaplow for *Glide Magazine*\n\nReflection upon just about anything can have personal meaning, but no amount of musicianship can mask a stark lack of context. I do wonder if Indie Folk should just return to the megachurch, where songwriters like Joe and musicians of his crew’s sort are literally *handed* a gigantic audience of trained experts at finding profound meaning where it probably isn’t, along with great salaries, from what I hear. Otherwise, all that taxing preparation and expenditure will only lead to more forgettable performances. Or perhaps I am simply misguided in my assumption that artists work exclusively to communicate *something* lasting to *someone*. Every conversation I’ve had with Portlanders about Portland music has been predominantly about what artists and their audiences wear and how they behave instead of *what they’re trying to say*. There’s nothing inherently wrong with leaving things petty, lyrically and choosing to remain content with established sounds, musically, as long as your work is advertised as **entertainment, not performance**.\n\n<iframe style=\"border: 0; width: 100%; height: 120px;\" src=\"https:\/\/bandcamp.com\/EmbeddedPlayer\/album=1935364656\/size=large\/bgcol=ffffff\/linkcol=00006b\/tracklist=false\/artwork=small\/track=2587170555\/transparent=true\/\" seamless><a href=\"http:\/\/thecigaretteburns.bandcamp.com\/album\/demos-2015\">Demos 2015 by The Cigarette Burns<\/a><\/iframe>\n\nBefore I came Northwest, my fiancé had been exposing me to a variety of its music, which I mostly tolerated politely. Dozens of albums and EPs were played through once and forgotten forever, but when I arrived at [a demo tape](http:\/\/thecigaretteburns.bandcamp.com\/album\/demos-2015) recorded by her long time friend’s band, [*The Cigarette Burns*](https:\/\/thecigaretteburns.bandcamp.com\/), I finally heard something familiar, yet vitally compelling: pissed off punks having fun. That said, I should admit that I only attended Saturday’s show because he was on the ticket, and I’m still glad I did.\n\nAfter what felt like hours of drowsy corn cob pipes, Christmas sweaters, and old sweethearts at fifty beats per minute (there were literally two young men sleeping within 15 feet of the bands for the duration,) Ricky sat himself on a stool in the midst of Kaplow’s sprawling gear load at 2:30AM with only his guitar and his voice. Unfortunately, I’d squandered the Nikon’s batteries on Californians (the lighting was not ideal anyway,) so I thought I’d share [his set on Periscope](https:\/\/www.pscp.tv\/AsphaltApostle\/1gqxvXNPRaBGB?t=5s). Though Ricky had been patiently present and attentive for the entire night (unlike myself,) those who were left of the entertainers bolted to the porch for a lively discussion about unicycles and quinoa while Ricky told us about hate, jealousy, and feeling like shit in a somber elegy. Any further adjectives may edge dangerously close to a half-assed “concert review,” which I am *not* yet qualified for, but I will say that Ricky’s sincerity made him most engaging part of the night, and his frustrated, conclusive nod to The Cigarette Burns was the first *real* punk sounds I’ve yet heard in Portland.\n\n![Indie Folk Battery Burglary](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/hNtIUA6.jpg)\n\nI realize sharing this small experience does little to grow the conversation, but this isn’t a magazine, and **I am desperate for answers** about the bizarre reality in which I find myself. [When Ricky dedicated a song to Courtney Love](https:\/\/youtu.be\/zJONjVnDADI?t=1050), one of the male musicians(?) yelled “Courtney Love fuckin’ killed Kurt Cobain!” which was *such* an unbelievably cliché happening\/decision that I’ll surely spend the rest of my days in this city unsuccessfully attempting to work it out, aloud. I can’t quite recall who it was last Fall that responded to my frustration by challenging “what if there’s nothing to understand?” While this may be a reasonable conclusion, I suspect it’s not one I could accept as long as I remain here without losing my mind. If Portland is truly the dimensionless bastion of apathy and intellectual stagnancy for young Americans, I must *blog my way out it* as soon as possible (for Pete’s sake, just give these kids some antidepressants,) but I’d still like to believe the idea too oxymoronic to actually exist.\n\n#music","views":758,"updated":"2022-03-18T16:45:49Z","tags":["music"],"type":null,"title":"West-Coast Indie Folk is Full of Battery-Burgling Megachurch Bands","slug":"indie-folk-joe-kaplow-megachurch-portland","appearance":"norm","language":"en","rtl":false,"created":"2018-10-18T02:41:28Z","images":["https:\/\/i.snap.as\/hNtIUA6.jpg","https:\/\/i.snap.as\/GewgcRj.jpg","https:\/\/i.snap.as\/2vEevFd.jpg","https:\/\/i.snap.as\/hwDHYHy.jpg"],"collection":{"public":false,"alias":"bilge","total_posts":0,"title":"The Psalms","verification_link":"","description":"A <a href=\"https:\/\/davidblue.wtf\/db.vcf\">narcoleptic yokel<\/a> on software and culture.","style_sheet":"","views":177027,"monetization_pointer":""},"paid":false},{"id":"q9fecudegllwv1y1","body":"##### by [Adam Bexten](https:\/\/twitter.com\/adambexten)\n\n![Robyn](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/BTp3K3a5.jpg)\n\n## On the eve of her new album’s first single reveal, we reflect on the Swedish artist’s incredibly-sincere, yet profound past contribution to the pop mystic.\n\nOn August 1, pop-extraordinaire Robyn released “[Missing U](https:\/\/song.link\/i\/1436781120),” her first proper single in eight years. Fans of the Swedish singer have long awaited a new album since 2010’s critically acclaimed Body Talk, but certainly were not left without material deserving of years of repeat-listening.\n\nDubbed the “_Body Talk_ series,” Robyn [initially announced](https:\/\/pitchfork.com\/news\/38039-robyn-plans-three-albums-for-2010\/) plans in early 2010 to release three mini-albums over the course of the year, but after releasing Body Talk Pt. 1 and Pt. 2, plans were altered and _Body Talk_ — a compilation of the best songs from Pt. 1 and Pt. 2, plus five new songs — was released on November 22, 2010. Described by Robyn as the “turbo version” of the album, fans were gifted an ever-evolving collection of songs that was eventually edited into a single pop masterpiece. Despite never reaching great commercial success, Body Talk today continues to garner a cult-like following and new fans. In 2014, _Pitchfork_ named it the [36th Best Album of the Decade](https:\/\/pitchfork.com\/features\/lists-and-guides\/9465-the-100-best-albums-of-the-decade-so-far-2010-2014\/?page=4) thus far.\n\nMost astonishingly, the album is built upon a foundation of intense honesty. Specifically, an honesty that’s only possible when paired with polished pop hooks and hidden amongst heavy synth. Robyn never misses a shot. The album is calculated, direct and always on target, regardless if she’s reminiscing on unrequited love, instructing a new lover on how to let his ex-girlfriend down gently, or giving the middle finger to everyone who keeps telling her what to do!\n\n“[Dancing On My Own](https:\/\/vimeo.com\/54353808),” the album’s debut single, remains a fan favorite and clear standout. On the track, Robyn explores the idea of dancing with tears in your eyes to a new level in the dancefloor tragedy of watching an ex-lover move on to a new woman. Don’t let the song’s catchiness mistake you. Upon hearing the first note, almost anyone would want to run for the dancefloor, but the track’s true genius lies in its lyrics, demanding stuck-on-repeat listening as you fall deep into her storytelling. It’s worthy of the all the acclaim it’s received, and more.\nAs Robyn bounces between the larger-than-life electo-queen on “Don’t Fucking Tell Me What To Do” and “Fembot” to the vulnerable, sentimental-synthesizer on “Stars 4 Ever” and “Indestructible,” she encapsulates emotional experiences in a way that is usually absent from the charts’ biggest hits. Her songs are bottled feelings.\n\nToday, and in 2010, the genre of pop is often treated as synonymous with singles dominating Top 40 stations – sometimes for good reason. The radio-ready songs are written and produced like products of a pop music factory. They’re strategically designed to get stuck in your head, to grab attention and ultimately, to make money. It’s commercial; it’s a business, but this false equivalence can lead many a music lover to discredit the entire genre as just an earworm, divorced from artistry. Body Talk puts all these arguments to rest.\n\nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=-3a2qoyONVA\n\n“[Hang With Me](https:\/\/song.link\/us\/i\/1440714992)” details the exact moment early in a relationship when you realize you can trust your partner and let down your walls. Upon first listen, the lyrics seem obvious and simple, but eventually you realize that’s where the brilliance lies. Robyn’s ability to tap into those universal moments and experiences that most of us can only recognize, not articulate. Not only does she accomplish this, here – she makes it catchy.\n\nThe entire album can be enjoyed at surface level without great interpretation or introspection. Robyn matches her ability to capture euphoric emotion with infectious beats, witty lyrics and over-the-top production. It can transport you back to your very first crush or your very first heartbreak. It can heighten your confidence to make you feel invincible or it can break you down to your most insecure form. It’s pop perfection.\n\nAs Robyn readies her eighth studio album, she returns to a different, darker world. “Missing U” doubles as a message for both the fans that have waited eight years for this moment and for the lover that left. One can’t help but imagine how this song might be played differently in a less solemn present, but either way, Robyn arrives just in the knick of time, offering the escapism of grand production, unforgettable lyrics and a perfect world where even our greatest problems can be solved out on the dancefloor. Like _Body Talk_, it’s not going to actually save the world, but it provides listeners a perfect opportunity to escape the heat, dance it out and – at its best – see themselves in a remarkably honest way.\n\n#music","views":518,"updated":"2021-10-26T20:27:53Z","tags":["music"],"type":null,"title":"The Timeless Dynamism of Robyn's 'Body Talk'","slug":"robyn-body-talk","appearance":"norm","language":"en","rtl":false,"created":"2018-10-19T04:49:24Z","images":["https:\/\/i.snap.as\/BTp3K3a5.jpg"],"collection":{"public":false,"alias":"extratone","total_posts":0,"title":"Extratone","verification_link":"","description":"For the New Curious.","style_sheet":"","views":182661,"monetization_pointer":""},"paid":false},{"id":"x2bg34gbdhq1j5nl","body":"![The Matchsellers](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/C7X1Eo2.png)\n\n## The duo's new album manages to be wonderfully explorative without sacrificing any sacred traditions.\n\n<!--more-->\n\nFor years, I took the voices and culture of working Americans for granted and sought to generally distance myself from my origin’s heritage as much as possible, but I’ve since realized that I couldn’t have done so without absolute certainty that country, bluegrass, and folk music were stubborn as State highway ditch-rooted fescue blades: omnipresent forces of Midwestern nature that’d secured their invincibility with the simple superiority of their belonging. While this conclusion is true enough for the time being, it’s quite independently so of their worth or necessity. In such conditional blindness, I’ve simply proven my sensibilities to be (predictably in the case of my seniors) not exempt. This truth is noteworthy only because of its potential to spare others the embarrassment of blatant ignorance to their own privilege. That said, I would suggest that you engage this music sincerely for a moment for your own sake, regardless of your own convictions regarding country music, Indiana, plaid, pickup trucks, the end of the world, or the proper noun for “cantaloupe.”\n\nAs young adults, even those folks who’ve remained resolutely country-minded found themselves trivializing the name of the titanic Dallas-born trio The Dixie Chicks not out of half-assed iconoclasm, but because their brand was so cleverly immune to irony. You thought you were proving yourself of a higher caliber of discernment, but mocking goddesses only paraded your ignorance. In my teen rebellion against the culture of my rural origin, I scoffed at their mention for a while, somehow oblivious to my blatant hypocrisy. Thanks to my older sisters and their automobiles, I spent before and after elementary school days absorbing thousands of hours’ worth of late-90s\/early-oughts Pop Country radio. Two summers ago, I returned to this library at length for the first time in 10 years and found my heart completely vulnerable to its related memories and my mind consistently flabbergasted by the oomph of the composition that defines the genre’s last mainstream hurrah.\n\nThe original three Chicks – Natalie Maines, Emily Robison, and Marty Maguire - are still very much alive, kicking, and radio-playing. They even “[returned from exile](https:\/\/www.tennessean.com\/story\/entertainment\/music\/2016\/08\/16\/dixie-chicks-long-road-back-exile\/88762752\/)” with a real international tour in 2016. (I regret little more in my adult life than missing the opportunity to see them.) According to [a fascinating November 2015 analysis](https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/music\/2015\/nov\/19\/the-dixie-chicks-tour-is-country-music-ready-to-forgive) in The Guardian, their 2003 denouncement of President George W. Bush cost them serious cred among their audience, but Johnny Cash likely [harbored similar sentiments](https:\/\/www.thenation.com\/article\/johnny-cash-was-not-republican), Stephen Morrissey is… [not straight](https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20131024020237\/http:\/true-to-you.net\/morrissey_news_131019_01), the most worthwhile current country sounds from my teenage home are [composed and performed by a trans woman](https:\/\/cowgirljordy.bandcamp.com\/), and the staple tunes from the genre’s most chaste personalities are often [just about sex](https:\/\/youtu.be\/yCmsZUN4r_s). No reasonable individual would still cite this incident in an argument opposing the essential legacy of these three miraculously talented women.\n\nFrom a pop perspective at least, The Dixie Chicks are almost certainly the penultimate expression of country music as a technical and emotional exercise. Their extraordinary musicianship and prodigally antecedent mastery of suave sincerity represented the absolute peak of pop country’s untenable relationship with the American working class in one hell of a 21st-century-breaching last hurrah that still brings tears of pride to many an eye. However, the hysterical backlash of the greater working people personified in part by Donald Trump’s presidency is a last sure indication of the mainstream’s final estrangement from all distillations of rural culture. In the coming years, I fear the toiling masses will be left only with less and less authentic, more and more suburban bastardizations of their music as the last superficial delusions of condescending affection from the middle class fade, and the enterprise dies. What does survive will “graduate” (retire) to Folk (for white performers,) and further strengthen the Blues resurrection (for everyone else.) That said, it’s hard to find anyone who’s comfortable mourning the loss openly after acceptance has progressively set in – there’s simply nowhere else to go, and its aging icons have been in desperate need of retirement throughout the Information Age.\n\n*The Top 10 Vegan Alternatives to Working-Class America*\n\nEven if I’d had the moderate exposure from my current perch in the midst of the notoriously grass-roots nature of Portland’s Folk\/Blues scene, 2000 miles west, I would have still been totally blindsided by my incidental introduction to The Matchsellers, two years ago. One needn’t harbor any presumptions about the relationship between Kansas City violinist\/fiddler Julie Bates and Hoosier blues guitarist, Andrew Morris – they’re just about the cutest pair you’ll ever see, couple’s act or not (it’s less relevant than you’d think, and none of our business.) They’re also extremely talented and genuinely authoritative world-class musicians with plenty of authentic country mileage who exude a proud air of warm, confident serenity occupying the bluegrass sphere. After happening upon their set at Columbia’s faux-speakeasy in Summer 2016, I was at once charmed and impressed by the pervasive magnitude of the ethereal aura that followed them, especially after our brief post-performance conversation. I’m ninety percent sure they came without a mobile phone between them carrying a wicker basket full of CDs and matchbooks, and shucks… I do believe we’ve been doing this whole thing wrong, all along.\n\n<iframe style=\"border: 0; width: 100%; height: 120px;\" src=\"https:\/\/bandcamp.com\/EmbeddedPlayer\/album=3739594282\/size=large\/bgcol=ffffff\/linkcol=00006b\/tracklist=false\/artwork=small\/transparent=true\/\" seamless><a href=\"http:\/\/thematchsellers.bandcamp.com\/album\/kosciusko-county\">Kosciusko County by The Matchsellers<\/a><\/iframe>\n\nI bought a copy of [Kosciusko County](https:\/\/thematchsellers.bandcamp.com\/album\/kosciusko-county) then and there and played the shit out of it the next summer, wandering aimlessly around Missouri with my best friend, revisiting (and occasionally disrupting) the resolute peace of the tiny communities I grew up orbiting. On our way to the Hannibal – Huckleberry’s Fictional home\/the great Mississippi’s tired tourism machine – we just left it on repeat. As a soundtrack to such sentimental pursuits, a central trio of back-to-back tracks proved especially potent, beginning with “[Mentone (The 3,000 lb Egg)](https:\/\/thematchsellers.bandcamp.com\/track\/mentone-the-3000-lb-egg)” - the work’s nostalgic, tear-jerking sole instrumental. Production isn’t low-fidelity, but appropriately honest – no amount of expensive mastering would be capable of compressing the essence of a surprise late-night live performance from The Matchsellers’ work into a digital audio file, anyway.\n\nBates’ fiddling is an impossibly rare pleasure – the real type of sawing that mystically manages to erase one’s inhibitions and sense of civic responsibility when tearing about the borders of quiet row-crop plots, leaving long-lived lesions of billowing limestone high above numbered county roads at ninety miles-per-hour. Succeeding the distant, eye-misting cruise of the 1.5-ton Egg, “[Driving Escort](https:\/\/thematchsellers.bandcamp.com\/track\/driving-escort)” is a masterpiece (naturally) of this raucous realm.\n\n*Driving down the road with a yellow light on top of my truck \/ Going down to Vincennes earning my sixty bucks.*\n\nAdd the accompaniment of Morris’ obviously-fathomless relationship with the guitar, and the result nails a select truth without any hint of prudishness. At sufficient volume, “[Muskmelon Breakdown](https:\/\/thematchsellers.bandcamp.com\/track\/muskmelon-breakdown)” becomes a beautifully-harmonious catalyst of fast, loose, maniacal, hilarious energy that’s sure to land you in a ditch, but you’ll still be laughing your ass off by the time you’re pulling clay clumps and waist-high fescue blades from your steaming radiator. *Kosciusko County* isn’t an innovative record by any critical instrumentation, but I’d do best to keep my sun-faded, skip-worn copy readily at hand for the next time I find myself on a fresh gravel road, whenever that may be.\n\n<iframe width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/Fjzto2ZZ8zU?controls=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe>\n\n> For the last five years, all we said was goodbye\n> I said it again, it was the fifth time\n>\n> I took your word and did what I thought was best\n> I took your word and went 600 miles west\n\nThat’s it, then – we’ve got The Matchsellers pretty well figured for either wannabe(?) or reformed(?) yahoos of their own design; charming, dusty novelties who chose a folly destiny of toiling their craft for none but a seasonal dozen acres of white, sweating State Fair flesh. Obviously, they’re meant for us sophisticated, globetrotting Winners to collect like thrift store antiques on our way down the interstate. Their time is ours to book for nothing on our mediocre “speakeasy’s” waxy new stage; to post on an Instagram story, to Tweet in an easy compartmentalization of their quaint displacement from our time, deep in the dusty recesses of our collections for no good bargain, where they’ll fall comfortably in line as our predictable and willing country servants should an opportunity happen upon us to show a stranger how interesting, dynamic, and worldly we are.\n\nAs a displaced (and formerly ex-communicated) yokel, I’ve often been astonished by how easy it is to discard American folk music for huge swaths of time unless it expresses some unignorable sort of spectacular torment. My own failure to recognize the value in this one until I became separated and homesick was an overtly foolhardy cliché (though quite predictable of like privilege,) but I can’t help but wonder: **is it unavoidable?** Of course, the process is necessary for ‘class justice’ – one might even call it a natural law of sorts – and in the case of The Matchsellers, there’s hardly a struggle to communicate emotionally. For a real music scholar, though, it’s surely worth asking of those voices who know: do the oppressed, destitute, and hope-impoverished people of this country still rely on bluegrass, or has it been replaced for them?\n\nThe abstraction of the phrase “good surprise” had plummeted from our collective vocabulary at a record-demolishing velocity in the interim, but this past spring’s release of [*Bluegrastronauts*](https:\/\/thematchsellers.bandcamp.com\/album\/bluegrastronauts) hit me squarely upside the skull again, stirring a solid half hour of hysterical, shrieking psychosis. I assumed the worst… *Dear God, what has the internet forced upon that sweet, rootsy duo*?! – and was immediately compelled to drop everything and listen.\n\n<iframe style=\"border: 0; width: 350px; height: 470px;\" src=\"https:\/\/bandcamp.com\/EmbeddedPlayer\/album=3499187895\/size=large\/bgcol=ffffff\/linkcol=00006b\/tracklist=false\/transparent=true\/\" seamless><a href=\"http:\/\/thematchsellers.bandcamp.com\/album\/bluegrastronauts\">Bluegrastronauts by The Matchsellers<\/a><\/iframe>\n\n*Hoosiers, we have a problem*. What the fuck is this album, exactly? A nonchalant, apparently oblivious challenge to every assumption you could possibly arrive with. It’s safe to suppose “Bluegrastronauts” refers to its departure from the rest of their discography – from smack dab in Indiana’s center to the goddamned Beta Quadrant, the two managed to stupefyingly ace a theme most comfortable residents of their bluegrass sphere would take care to avoid leaving up on the kitchen whiteboard – even tackling apocalypse with regal serenity. At first glance, I was sure that copious soft glow had to either be the false product of my own insanity, or a deliberate attempt to alienate the sum of their audience in a single crises of identity. In fact, The Matchsellers had pulled off yet another especially-sparse artistic miracle and harnessed their creative restlessness to propel their departure from the elderly genre’s pretensions without spilling a single drip of their secret sauce. It’s not a concept album (thank God,) but doesn’t wander in any disparaging sense, either.\n\n> Earl Scruggs in a spaceship on his way to Mars\n> Pickin' away on the banjo at 100,000 miles an hour\n> Bill Monroe in a rocket, see the look on his face\n> it's mighty dark to travel when you're in outer space\n\nName-dropping four bluegrass legends within the number 1 album-titled introductory track is the pair’s single self-conscious acknowledgment of visiting folk fanatics: this CD looks crazy, but we know what we’re doing – and Kansas City’s mention accredits the locale of the following entirely Missouri-made production. Indeed, in the WhoDoneIts, you’ll see The HillBenders’ [Chad Graves](https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/p\/Bfwh-rmhcet\/) layed em’ down in Springfield, and Johnny Kenepaske’s [Dead Horse Sound Company](https:\/\/deadhorsesoundcompany.com\/) spread em’ around in the Heart of America, itself. Missourian musicians especially should take note of these names: the offerings may have diversified since my day, but sound talent like this is difficult to come across, even within explosive college towns. Cutting two live acoustic tracks per performer – four in total – while expecting to retain any subsequent control over the behavior of either unwanted or subject sound is as difficult as any other circumstance you’ll encounter in studio production at this level. I know this much (but little more in that direction): real sound control is simply too tedious to bear for monomiking rascals with GarageBand. Now, having lost or been estranged from any remotely-professional sound reproduction equipment, *Bluegrastronauts* sounds as balanced and polished as my wired Apple earbuds could ever convey.\n\nIn shared verses, Julie and Andrew’s charmed harmonies are separated beautifully about the listener without inducing a sense of lateral imbalance when one of them sings alone. (Admittedly, I don’t exactly know how it’s accomplished.) No single personality in the record’s toolset – guitar, fiddle, banjo, bass, or dobro steps over any other.\n\nI have no idea who’s listening, but I’m positive their numbers should be multiplying by a hundredfold very quickly, filling especially with all of ye who feel abandoned by all authentic American representation. They shouldn’t ever fill up stadiums or establishment radiowaves, nor should their art invite extensive pretentious dissection, but they will be adored.\n\nIt’s a quintessential manner of Country Boy pride to whip the middle class’s condescension right back around with a classic demonstration: Oh, you thought I didn’t know about that? You thought I couldn’t *do* that? Well, of course I can! I’m just not particularly interested.

She briefly introduces the issue with a bulleted list of illiteracy's consequences on modern society and the individual cited from a [Canadian literacy foundation](https:\/\/www.fondationalphabetisation.org\/en\/) before turning the stage over to [Lecester Johnson](https:\/\/aohdc.org\/about-us\/staff\/lecester-johnson-chief-executive-officer\/), CEO of the [Academy of Hope Adult Public Charter School](https:\/\/aohdc.org\/about-us\/staff\/lecester-johnson-chief-executive-officer\/) in Washington D.C.\n\nJohnson presents a passionate and well-informed exploration of the state of the literacy battle from the perspective of a full-time, locally on-the-ground advocate. Her op-ed's introduction includes the most essential observations and statistics throughout, noting \"the children of parents with low literacy skills are more likely to live in poverty as adults and are five times more likely to drop out of school,\" before setting upon a detailed examination of current and relevant organizations working toward *solutions*. Of course, it's largely centered upon her own organization, which she claims has \"helped more than 6000 adults rebuild their education and job opportunities since 1985.\"\n\nIt's significant that an institution as deeply embedded across the American political spectrum as *The Washington Post* address the issue of American illiteracy, and both Johnson and Strauss are certainly qualified voices for the undertaking, but when we examine this particular article, it's important we consider the context of the *Answer Sheet* newsletter and its intended audience. Though it's no challenge to pitch the importance of reading and writing to parents and professional educators, the most alarming and destructive issue at hand is the educational disparity between *their adult peers*. \"There's a literacy problem in the capitol, but I'm not talking about young people who can't read. Many adults -- perhaps even parents sitting next to you at back to school night -- don't possess academic skills,\" notes Johnson with her very first paragraph. However, considering the nature of parenthood, the audience primarily consuming these words are undoubtedly preoccupied with *juvenile* issues, specifically, and we can assume their capacity to empathize with their fellow working adults who could benefit from literacy education is actually *lessened* from that of childless readers of the same age as a result. \"Despite the magnitude of the adult literacy crisis, most of those needing to make up lost ground are pushed toward traditional classroom settings--even though many of these people can't possibly follow through because of cost or work schedules or other obstacles,\" she attests.\n\nPerhaps more than any other American city, Detroit has been struggling with a serious illiteracy problem.

When voices of advocates like Lecester Johnson *are* uplifted by major organizations like *The Washington Post*, the sociological weight of the illiteracy issue can be very powerful.

Of course, I am aware that rea­son­able peo­ple would regard a “sneak peek,” NDA-vio­lat­ing, per­fect­ly Adobe Pre­miered app review to be pret­ty fuck­ing lame, and I won’t dis­pute any accu­sa­tions to the tune of “just an insane white guy with a Word­Press site,” but I still believe it’s impor­tant to talk about soft­ware *espe­cial­ly* because vir­tu­al­ly every­one uses it (as opposed to qui­et­ing down just when these apps and the peo­ple who make them attain the most advan­ta­geous pos­si­ble posi­tion to fuck the whole world.)\n\nThat said, I’m going to keep this as brief and unre­vi­sion­ist as I can: Tweetbot’s [lat­est iter­a­tion](https:\/\/9to5mac.com\/2018\/10\/18\/tweetbot-true-dark-mode-gifs\/) may actu­al­ly jus­ti­fy the [ded­i­cat­ed sub­red­dit](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Tweetbot\/) I’ve just dis­cov­ered! (Reddit’s the last place any­one wants to talk about apps, I guess.) I’ve com­plained at length about Twitter’s increas­ing­ly hos­tile (but [jus­ti­fied, sortof](https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2018\/4\/25\/17274828\/twitter-earning-q1-2018-profit-user-growth)) treat­ment of its once [aston­ish­ing­ly diverse land­scape of third-par­ty clients and tools](https:\/\/mashable.com\/2009\/05\/02\/twitter-iphone-apps\/#S_O.z..2mqqJ), yet I’d hon­est­ly grown sig­nif­i­cant­ly in accept­ing that the dynam­ic would nev­er again see the pow­er of the world’s most cash-stuffed com­pa­nies deliv­ered into the sweaty hands of small, kooky one and two-man teams, and it *nev­er* would’ve occurred to me that Tweet­bot was still around — much less get­ting ready to update its trusty old app with a release that would sud­den­ly make it clear­ly more sta­ble *and* bet­ter-look­ing than its last com­peti­tor: [the Native Fuck, itself](https:\/\/itunes.apple.com\/us\/app\/twitter\/id333903271?mt=8), which has also under­gone [sig­nif­i­cant cos­met­ic surgery](https:\/\/www.searchenginejournal.com\/twitter-redesigns-ios-app-for-one-handed-scrolling\/276541\/), recent­ly.

Imag­ine if the fed­er­al gov­ern­ment announced via White House press con­fer­ence that every stop­light in the Unit­ed States was going to have its yel­low light removed to “stream­line work­flow” with­out any fur­ther expla­na­tion, yet only 1000 *total* Amer­i­cans even both­ered to tune in to the tele­vi­sion cov­er­age across all the news net­works. It’d be strange, yeah? Well, y’all are using Twit­ter more than you’re dri­ving, I’ll bet. Next time, **get out and** [vote on my Twit­ter poll](https:\/\/twitter.com\/NeoYokel\/status\/1062859883211620352), you fascist!\n\nIn my Twit­ter glo­ry days — that is, when I used to spend the entire­ty of every one of my com­mu­ni­ty col­lege class­es Tweet­ing from my phone — there was a healthy offer­ing of third-par­ty clients on both mobile and desk­top that filled the eng­lish of the era’s soft­ware media with an absolute­ly bar­bar­ic brand-beat­en pile of lin­guis­tic Twit­trash. After Twin­kle — one of the [ear­li­est and ugli­est](https:\/\/www.macrumors.com\/2008\/07\/17\/twinkle-another-twitter-client-in-app-store\/) ways to use Twit­ter ever — you’d have to choose between Twit­pic, Tweet­deck, Twit­ter­counter, Twit­ter­feed, Twhirl, Twit­turly, Twt­poll, Retweet­ist, Tweepler, Hel­lotxt, Twit­dom, Tweetscan, Tweet­burn­er, Tweet­vi­sor, Twit­ter­vi­sion, Twibs, Twistori, and Twit­bin. These are just a few I picked up from a [10-year-old](https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2009\/02\/19\/the-top-20-twitter-applications\/) [*TechCrunch*](https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2009\/02\/19\/the-top-20-twitter-applications\/) [report](https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2009\/02\/19\/the-top-20-twitter-applications\/) list­ing the top 21 Twit­ter appli­ca­tions by traf­fic.\n\n### ***Twibs***\n\nNow, I have to stop myself from dig­ging too deep here and attempt­ing some­thing absurd like *The His­to­ry of Twit­ter Clients*, but the fuck­ing mate­r­i­al is there! I could spend an entire after­noon going through YouTube search­es and gad­get blogs because it brings me back to that time when I lived every day assum­ing these things were going to con­tin­ue to aston­ish for my entire adult­hood. So many incred­i­ble ideas! *How­ev­er,* I’m going to save them for lat­er and focus on the cream of the crop, so to speak: **Twit­terif­ic** and **Tweet­bot**, which has been a long­time favorite of mine. As I said, it was in com­mu­ni­ty col­lege that I first ponied up mon­ey for Tweet­bot 3 on my iPhone 4S sim­ply because the hype over it among app and gad­get nerds was *so bonkers* that it man­aged to spill over into my life, despite the fact that iOS7 and I were hav­ing seri­ous issues in our mar­riage.\n\nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=DE1YHcoPxMk\n\nIf you trust Mark Wat­son with your life as I do, you’d bet­ter believe that Tweet­bot has been “[a scream­er](https:\/\/youtu.be\/DE1YHcoPxMk)” since its very begin­ning, when it pio­neered the *Pre­mi­um Poweruser* seg­ment, for which a demo­graph­ic appar­ent­ly still exists. It was *fast*, yet always notice­ably smoother than the native app, just as the newest release is today. I must point out, though, that the blog­gers and YouTu­bers who’ve insist­ed that Tweet­bot or Twit­ter­rif­ic or any oth­er pre­mi­um app could replace the native Twit­ter app entire­ly on iPhone even before they were stripped of a most live\/push func­tion­al­i­ty (which I’ll come back around to in just a moment,) are undoubt­ed­ly lying to them­selves — as good as they got, they nev­er over­took Twitter’s own app in imme­di­a­cy terms, which is almost inevitably going to present fun­da­men­tal deter­rence on the part of the active Twit­ter user who intends to rid them­selves of the default pedes­tri­an avenue of admin­is­tra­tion. Tweet­bot solved a lot of things, it real­ly is *daft* when it comes to noti­fi­ca­tions. It wouldn’t be the end of the world if they came a few hun­dred sec­onds late — it’s that they’re nev­er pre­dictably or con­sis­tent­ly so, which sev­ers entire­ly the human per­cep­tion of engaged *plugged-in-ness*, if you will. It’s the same phe­nom­e­na Chuck Kloster­man explores best in the con­text of DVRing live sports to watch lat­er. \n\n>It’s dif­fi­cult to project fic­tion­al sce­nar­ios that are more oblique and unex­pect­ed than the cra­zi­est moments from real­i­ty. We all under­stand this. And that under­stand­ing is at the core of the human attrac­tion to live­ness. We don’t crave live sport­ing events because we need imme­di­a­cy; we crave them because they rep­re­sent those (increas­ing­ly rare) cir­cum­stances in which the entire spec­trum of pos­si­bil­i­ty is in play. \n>-“[Space, Time, and DVR Mechan­ics](http:\/\/grantland.com\/features\/space-time-dvr-mechanics)” by Chuck Kloster­man\n\nTweet­bot is unques­tion­ably a more thor­ough envi­ron­ment in which to explore Twit­ter than any oth­er third par­ty client, but it can’t do the live thing. (Please do com­plain to Twit­ter, Inc. about the API sit­u­a­tion if you’re so inclined, though.) All I’m try­ing to say is, **there is no fuck­ing rea­son you’d delete the Twit­ter app** — hide it away in a fold­er and nev­er ever open it again if it dis­gusts you so, but leave its noti­fi­ca­tions set­tings on so that it can keep itself busy in there. Now *that* is a smart work­flow! In fact, it was mine! And it did work for such a long time that you’d prob­a­bly for­get about the arrange­ment in no time were there not the occa­sion­al obvi­ous dis­crep­an­cies between Tweetbot’s Mention’s tab and the native app’s instant noti­fi­ca­tions. There has nev­er been — nor will there be, I think — a client for Twit­ter that can replace *some* use of its own prop­er­ties. \n\nI think Tweet­bot 3 *made* me into my own ridicu­lous equiv­a­lent of a “poweruser.” Things are a lit­tle hazy now, but I know that I depart­ed my main Twit­ter account just before the app’s release, and I didn’t come back until 2015. I was going to school in the same old mall build­ing that housed the tool store in which I was also work­ing in full-time, which is sure­ly the only expla­na­tion for the shame­less­ness I demon­strat­ed in bring­ing a wire­less Apple Blue­tooth key­board to my class­es and plac­ing it behind the phone on what­ev­er sur­face was in front of me so that I could lean for­ward and type into iOS with my nose damned near touch­ing the screen. Strange­ly, I was not able to ver­i­fy when Blue­tooth key­board sup­port was added to iOS, but we’re going to [con­clude for the sake of con­ve­nience](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/iphone\/comments\/9y1bjd\/when_was_support_for_bluetooth_keyboards\/) that it was first includ­ed in the imme­di­ate pre­de­ces­sor to the iPhone 4S I was using then.\n\n>The cognoscen­ti have been on Twit­ter for years now. Stephen Fry, the web service’s patron saint — in Britain at least, joined in 2008. How­ev­er, it wasn’t until ear­ly 2009, xsome­where around the time that Fry tweet­ed while stuck in a lift, that the ser­vice went tru­ly main­stream. Men­tions of Twit­ter, usu­al­ly involv­ing celebri­ties, could be found in news­pa­pers and on break­fast tele­vi­sion.\n>-“[Top 10 tech­nol­o­gy high­lights of 2009](https:\/\/www.telegraph.co.uk\/technology\/6817359\/Top-10-technology-highlights-of-2009.html) ” | *The Telegraph* \n\nIf you’ve made it this far, you’ve already seen the demos and skimmed reviews at least. You should know by now whether or not Tweet­bot 5 is worth it to you in pure­ly func­tion­al terms, but I think we should all acknowl­edge that **this release of Tweet­bot is like­ly the last com­pet­i­tive third-par­ty Twit­ter app for iOS**. The mess that is Twit­ter, Inc. has [made clear this year](https:\/\/blog.twitter.com\/official\/en_us\/topics\/product\/2018\/investing-in-the-best-twitter-experience-for-you.html) that it intends to pri­or­i­tize its own clients over main­tain­ing the APIs nec­es­sary for oth­ers to receive push noti­fi­ca­tions. And when I say “its own,” I’m also refer­ring to our dear­est [Tweet­Deck](https:\/\/youtu.be\/EHDOQVAQzec), which they in fact *absorbed*. From a busi­ness per­spec­tive, it makes sense: only “six mil­lion App Store and Google Play users installed the top five third-par­ty Twit­ter clients between Jan­u­ary 2014 and July 2018,” [accord­ing to *TechCrunch*](https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/08\/17\/6-million-users-had-installed-third-party-twitter-clients\/). I nev­er expect­ed to see Tweet­bot on the App Store charts again, nor would I have con­sid­ered that [Echophon](https:\/\/itunes.apple.com\/us\/app\/echofon-for-twitter\/id286756410?mt=8), [Tweet­Cast­er](https:\/\/itunes.apple.com\/us\/app\/tweetcaster-for-twitter\/id420792544) or [Twit­ter­rif­ic](https:\/\/apps.apple.com\/us\/app\/twitterrific-tweet-your-way\/id580311103) would have been left avail­able. They’re on the App Store, at least, and I can con­firm that they all tech­ni­cal­ly *still work*, but it’s safe to say they’re show­ing their fuck­ing age. Tweet­bot and Twit­ter­rif­ic, though, are not just satel­lite prod­ucts of the plat­form — they *[lit­er­al­ly built it](https:\/\/furbo.org\/2011\/03\/11\/twitterrific-firsts\/)*. These two are the poles that have spent Twitter’s life­time thus far demon­strat­ing for the com­pa­ny and its user­base their own respec­tive inter­pre­ta­tions of a mobile social appli­ca­tion. Today, they are unit­ed — along with [Talon](http:\/\/klinkerapps.com\/talon-overview\/) and [Tweet­ings](https:\/\/www.tweetings.net\/apps\/) — in a [plea for con­tin­ued access](http:\/\/apps-of-a-feather.com\/) to the plat­form they helped estab­lish on behalf of Twit­ter users and devel­op­ers around the world.\n\nBoth Tweet­bot and Twit­ter­rif­ic are in their 5th ver­sions, and nei­ther has actu­al­ly changed much since iOS 7. (Twit­ter­rif­ic appears to still be in the same ver­sion num­ber.) Fac­ing the grow­ing walls around the ser­vice, one strug­gles to imag­ine them sur­viv­ing more than one or two iOS releas­es, but [I’ve been wrong before](https:\/\/twitter.com\/NeoYokel\/status\/712292559058444288). (In fact, I dis­cov­ered yes­ter­day that Look­book is [still around some­how](https:\/\/lookbook.nu\/mom).) By the time iOS 7 came around, the new native Twit­ter app still [looked fuck­ing ter­ri­ble](https:\/\/www.cultofmac.com\/246067\/twitter-for-ios-7-released-with-new-design-icon-on-iphone-and-ipad\/). When Tap­bots [released Tweet­bot 3](https:\/\/mashable.com\/2013\/10\/24\/tweetbot-3-for-iphone-review\/#SDbMxlCvFPqx), every­thing about its visu­al expe­ri­ence was beyond any­thing we’d seen on the iPhone before and its effec­tive­ness as a Twit­ter tool was imme­di­ate­ly rec­og­niz­able in con­trast with even Jack’s brand-new app and mobile web expe­ri­ence. The ani­ma­tions were taste­ful and smooth and the “pro user” label on Tapbot’s demo­graph­ic allowed them to ful­ly explore the func­tion­al­i­ty of iPhone’s ges­tures sep­a­rate any bond with the hypo­thet­i­cal­ly least-capa­ble user.\n\nThis is a dynam­ic which I am appar­ent­ly unable to avoid across just about all of my sub­jects — includ­ing [dig­i­tal media](http:\/\/extratone.com\/freq) — so you may take it as gen­er­al­ly unrea­son­able or extreme, but I’m near­ly as tired of being treat­ed as an idiot *user* as I am an idiot *read­er*. *Read­abil­i­ty* is to *Usabil­i­ty*, etc. It’s espe­cial­ly aggra­vat­ing when I *could* do so much more if devel­op­ers would just assume I’m capa­ble of any knowl­edge acqui­si­tion or intel­lec­tu­al growth what­so­ev­er. Except for a few left­over key­board short­cuts, the native Twit­ter app’s only func­tion are the most obvi­ous to engage with, as per the high­est pos­si­ble stan­dards of use, which would make per­fect sense if it was paired with com­pe­tent invest­ments in *Acces­si­bil­i­ty*, but Twit­ter always appears to [detest the sub­ject](https:\/\/theoutline.com\/post\/2458\/there-are-still-some-people-on-twitter-who-don-t-have-280-characters?zd=1&amp;zi=zbzf6tkp), even while qui­et­ly putting in some of the work. Thanks to Mastodon’s explic­it and vis­i­ble acknowl­edge­ment of acces­si­bil­i­ty by way of just one young Ger­man man and a vol­un­teer team, we cer­tain­ly know it’s *not* because it’s an expen­sive one at all. (The “if Mastodon can do it than Twit­ter can *def­i­nite­ly* fuck­ing do it” argu­ment can be expand­ed almost with­out lim­it.)\n\n>Some­where out there is a social media man­ag­er using a screen read­er whose pro­fes­sion­al­ism has been under­mined by the belief that the update is avail­able to every­one. We deserve equal access to the tools our peers take for grant­ed, and the secu­ri­ty to know that we will be able to do our jobs tomor­row regard­less of updates.\n>-Kit Englard for *[The Out­line](https:\/\/theoutline.com\/post\/2458\/there-are-still-some-people-on-twitter-who-don-t-have-280-characters)*\n\nI would like to com­mend myself now for mak­ing it this far with­out men­tion­ing **Lists** — a sub­ject which I’ve already [Tweet­ed](https:\/\/twitter.com\/i\/moments\/996616971880882176) and [writ­ten](http:\/\/www.extratone.com\/tech\/lists\/) about exten­sive­ly — but this time, I have the won­drous bless­ing of two pre­miere mobile soft­ware com­pa­nies who rec­og­nized the poten­tial pow­er in list func­tion­al­i­ty to dis­pel or avoid most of the inher­ent risks assigned to the usage of a social net­work like Twit­ter and bet heav­i­ly on it. Nei­ther can be uti­lized to the fullest with­out lists and *wouldn’t it be such a shame* to not get your money’s worth? Tap­bots expand­ed their cura­tive abil­i­ty tremen­dous­ly by adding cus­tomiz­able fil­ters to any time­line in Tweet­bot, allow­ing the user to infi­nite­ly manip­u­late incom­ing posts with any com­bi­na­tion of every vari­able sup­port­ed by the core Twit­ter code itself. With­in a mat­ter of sec­onds, you could cre­ate a fil­ter that will exclude all Tweets except for those from unver­i­fied accounts that men­tion “blimps” and include a media attach­ment and apply this fil­ter to any of the app’s time­line views — includ­ing Home, Men­tions, Pro­file (your own Tweets,) your Favorites, and your Search­es — every­thing but your Direct Mes­sages can be sort­ed this way.\n\nTweet­Bot and I accom­plished a lot of sort­ing togeth­er, and it wouldn’t have occurred to me had it not crept to #1 Paid Social App again a few weeks ago that per­haps [my bias towards Twit­ter lists](http:\/\/www.extratone.com\/tech\/lists\/) could be entire­ly attrib­uted to my ear­ly use of Tweet­Bot and Twit­ter­rif­ic, which allowed me to amass a [Fol­low­ing count](https:\/\/twitter.com\/neoyokel\/following) of over 5000 with­out phys­i­cal­ly per­ish­ing or men­tal­ly dis­in­te­grat­ing to the point of unde­ni­able insan­i­ty. How­ev­er, by the time [Tweet­Bot 4 was released](https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2015\/10\/1\/9432291\/tweetbot-4-ipad-iphone-available) in 2015, it had long since swapped places with the native app with­in my iPhone’s home­screens and was only used when I felt par­tic­u­lar­ly like Tweet­storm­ing from a sta­tion­ary sit­u­a­tion. From my wire­less Apple Key­board, this meant Cmd (⌘)-N to com­pose a Tweet and ⌘-Enter to send it.\n\nToday — [in Tweet­bot 5](https:\/\/www.macstories.net\/reviews\/tweetbot-5-for-ios-brings-a-redesign-dedicated-giphy-support-and-a-new-dark-mode\/) — this con­tin­ues to be a tried-and-true method of Tweet­ing Tweets on Twit­ter, smooth­ly and effi­cient­ly, as always. Return­ing to Ye Olde Alter­na­tive in 2018 yields both famil­iar *and* new­ly-imple­ment­ed goods: ani­ma­tion and audio noti­fi­ca­tions are car­ried over and\/or updat­ed as need­ed to main­tain a flu­id and fresh expe­ri­ence. The abil­i­ty to switch between its intel­li­gent­ly-cho­sen col­or themes with a two-fin­gered ver­ti­cal swipe, alone will be jus­ti­fi­ca­tion enough for many users like myself to hand over anoth­er $4.99 to the Tap­bots devel­op­ers who’ve man­aged against all odds to one-up Twitter’s own mobile app devel­op­ment one last time.

We'd only that day been first made aware of Boomerang photos and the mysterious nature of \"Live Blogging\" as an occupation. [AirPods were introduced](https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2016\/12\/20\/14016568\/apple-airpods-wireless-earpods-earbuds-review) and subsequently shit on, and the [comparatively archaic](https:\/\/bilge.world\/mono-audio-playback) 3.5mm analog audio jack was confidently parted with, finally. At least I got over \"forgetting\" about Live Photos because it's rapidly becoming difficult to keep stuff *on* the phone now. *I* am coming sincerely close to believing none of this is real, anyway. Today, though, it’s a damned straight ballgame, isn’t it? Months have passed since Apple pushed out its major mobile OS release of the year to [more little rectangular computers](https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2016\/1\/26\/10835748\/apple-devices-active-1-billion-iphone-ipad-ios) than any one person could speedcount in a lifetime and YouTube is already recommending me dozens of [videos about the next one](https:\/\/youtu.be\/CXKqCWWjxSM). At this point, you and I are already aware of the iOS development community, who has already been using Internet Operating System 12 on their personal devices for more than half a year by the time your irises are landing here. Hopefully, all but two or three stranded, dying explorers in the arctic have updated their iPhones and iPads by now, and why wouldn’t they?\n\n<iframe src=\"https:\/\/www.listennotes.com\/podcasts\/end-user\/siri-shortcuts-are-ios-12s--Vlsfa8engC\/embed\/\" height=\"180px\" width=\"100%\" style=\"width: 1px; min-width: 100%;\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" loading=\"lazy\"><\/iframe>\n\nOur expectations from this ritual are completely alien compared to those we’d need to anticipate from the event 5 or 6 releases ago, when one’s phone had to be sent away (in a sense) to latch itself tight to the stability of a desktop-class product in order to undergo a lengthy, destined metamorphosis. Sometimes, backups via 30-pin to USB-2.0 cables took hours, after which the custodian may or may not find their companion’s replication had completed successfully. If it had, one had to be sure to close any applications apart from iTunes to provide a working environment of utter silence – restarting after finishing the download was my own preferred method – before entrusting the despicably unreliable software to whittle away in a sometimes frantically rebooting, feverish procedure with near life-threatening stigma: it wasn’t uncommon for an update to inexplicably fail, “bricking” the subject iPhone and requiring that one take two whole steps in the wrong direction and restore it from the entire backup they’d just created (hopefully) in order to… make another, precisely-identical attempt, for lack of variables or alternatives to the process. However, if the user planned sufficiently and made a point to begin the whole charade immediately upon arriving home for the evening, these potential frustrations could be compensated for, and odds would favor counting on their smartphone to emerge safe and sound from the procedure just before bed, when even those holding the second-newest product in the lineage would have just enough screen time to notice that text entry, web page loading, and window management had noticeably slowed before sighing and tossing their device toward the darkness.\n\nhttps:\/\/twitter.com\/cher\/status\/278053444135288833\n\nThese days, one would need to try very hard to be inconvenienced by iOS updates. My iPhone 8 Plus is two or three times more powerful than my laptop at the moment, and my new friends’ WiFi connection is better than what the State government uses internally, back home. I haven’t needed to physically back it up more than once or twice since I bought it — iCloud stores the lot for $4.99­ a month anyway. I blinked once watching *Riki-Oh* with high school friends some time ago and all of the sudden, a 1.6GB download isn’t really a big deal. Siddown and watch your Instagram stories for twenty minutes, and *hey*! You’re ready to update! Somehow, I have abruptly found myself in a reality in which **I am the obvious bottleneck** and my 100 words per minute on a smartphone keyboard, even, is no longer fast enough: my fucking phone is now **waiting on me** when it updates. The keyholder is the whole goddamned holdup.\n\nSo, what possible purpose could there be in pounding out this “Review” of a free software update that’s in no way optional (waiting a month is no longer a rational minimization of risk — it’s just dumb,) not any more difficult to attain than the bills currently waiting in your mailbox, nor allowed by the nature of mobile operating systems to compete with any cross-platform alternatives? For myself, it’s proved [a gratifying tradition of sorts](http:\/\/bilge.world\/ios-10-review-speed\/) and a good use of my apparently-abundant time if only for the record's sake (hello, future web archivists, neohuman and otherwise!,) but this release – assuming I haven’t overlooked something – is the most globe-shucking of all because of one single featureset: **Siri Shortcuts**. However, the vast majority of the intra-Apple press' coverage of this release has come across nearly as unconcerned with them as I was originally. Take [*Macworld*'s iOS 12 Review](https:\/\/www.macworld.co.uk\/review\/ios-apps\/ios-12-3683670\/), for instance: it was the first result in my Google search for \"iOS 12 review,\" yet Siri Shortcuts are only mentioned in the bottom quarter of its first page. When I recorded the \"[iOS 12 Review](https:\/\/radiopublic.com\/end-user-WdbezM\/ep\/s1!ba096)\" episode of my \"[podcast](https:\/\/anchor.fm\/davidblue),\" I spoke as if I was somehow the only person on the planet who comprehends the profound implications of this software addition - which was, of course, more of [an absorbent acquisition](https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2017\/03\/22\/apple-has-acquired-workflow-a-powerful-automation-tool-for-ipad-and-iphone\/) - but I have since discovered one gem, at least, which has continued the conversation in a most superb manner. It's [a technology podcast called *Supercomputer*](https:\/\/supercomputer.transistor.fm\/about), and it's hosted by [Alex Cox](https:\/\/twitter.com\/AlexCox) and [Matthew Cassinelli](https:\/\/twitter.com\/AlexCox) - the latter of whom developed a significant amount of the iOS app [Workflow](https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2015\/05\/16\/workflow-hints-at-the-future-of-the-watch-as-a-computing-platform\/) (and wrote most or all of its documentation, [apparently](https:\/\/anchor.fm\/davidblue),) which Apple assimilated as Siri Shortcuts. Both are extremely knowledgeable and competent commentators on - as far as I can hear, at least - virtually **the entire iOS *lifestyle***. (For those on the outside who've never stepped in: laugh if you must, but yes it *is* a lifestyle, still, and it's new thought leader [isn't exactly coming up short](https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2018\/12\/3\/18124416\/tim-cook-apple-infowars-white-supremacy-podcasts-platform-adl) these days.) iOS is technically *software*, yes, but it leaves an intractable itch for some greater, transcendent term.\n\nhttps:\/\/youtube.com\/watch?v=pxtA9n2XwAM\n\nIn just forty minutes, without any prior knowledge about this feature, I was able to create a Shortcut which sends any given handset's IP address and precise GPS location (among other mundane metrics) in a text message **to my phone number**. I could share this shortcut among my other submissions to [Sharecuts](https:\/\/sharecuts.app\/) or [ShortcutsGallery.com](https:\/\/shortcutsgallery.com\/), where any iOS user could download and subsequently send this information back to *my* phone. (Don't believe me? [Have a go at it yourself](https:\/\/www.icloud.com\/shortcuts\/2873cc28684646e1904f0e80c21c8481) and I'll send back a screenshot if you'd like.) I accomplished this without any particular skills or education in software development or cybersecurity - without any real *malice*, even - I was just playing around. As far as my recollection goes, Apple has *never* included such a powerful, potentially-dangerous piece of software in a standard software update before. It's both absolutely brilliant and sortof a ripoff to be so entrusted for the first time. In many ways - like my Disable Bluetooth & WiFi shortcut - Siri Shortcuts represent an awfully half-assed solution to some of the most basic, longtime incongruencies within iOS. Sure, it's great that I can just make myself a shortcut to completely disable my phone's WiFi and Bluetooth activity with one press or Siri command (combining \"type to Siri\" with Siri Shortcuts basically enables a form of Command Line functionality in iOS,) but frankly, one should've expected the world's largest company to *do it themselves* in perhaps the second of third version of this operating system instead of saying *okay, here are the tools - you do it!* in its *twelfth*. \n\nI've found it inevitable when speaking on iOS to avoid discussing the *other* literature available on the subject at any given time. The depth to which technology media has assimilated the habits and mannerisms of a single American company is absolutely mind-boggling, regardless of its history, its market share, or even its recent trillion-dollar valuation. Dozens of media companies – *[CultofMac](https:\/\/www.cultofmac.com\/)*, *[MacRumors](https:\/\/www.macrumors.com\/)*, *[Macworld](https:\/\/www.macworld.com\/)*, *[9to5 Mac](https:\/\/9to5mac.com\/)*, [*AppleInsider*](https:\/\/appleinsider.com\/), *[iMore](https:\/\/www.imore.com\/)*, and... more – exist solely to cover one single independent company: **Apple, Incorporated**. One wonders how the sum total of the individuals involved with and these organizations compares with the total number of employees working for the company their careers are (for the moment, at least,) entirely centered around. (Further interesting questions: are there any comparable situations anywhere else in Western capitalism, and if not - doesn't this sort of attention constitute *some kind* of Monopoly, even if it was not necessarily an anti-competitive one?) For \"reasonable people,\" the image one conjures up of *The All-The-Time Apple Beat* does not lend to envy, but let's choose to limit ourselves to only the most casual forms of speculation. I do not wish to mock them, for I, too remember the sensation of The Apple Drug from an unfortunate time in my childhood development when I was willing to wear a cheap sweatshirt branded with a stupid Mac vs. Windows Users joke unironically to a real live public Junior High school. There are few more embarrassing admissions, except perhaps admitting that a part of me genuinely yearns to return to this level of enthusiasm, as misplaced and cringey as it was. It's the addiction to the mystic; it's aspirational in its democratization. *Billionaires* are running the same operating system and much of the same software as I am every day - even the most followed person on any given platform is still accessing it through the same interface I might be. These are incredible truths, but they also reflect a dangerous lack of competition in a product category that has become more essential to day-to-day human life than any other in just three or four blinks of an eye.\n\nhttps:\/\/twitter.com\/NeoYokel\/status\/1068037512738811904\n\n*Fuck David Blue*, though. Who are the *real*, *hard-hitting* minds who've kept this industry and this company in check? Well, it's funny you should ask that, because the people's quirky *New York Times* tech critic of late - the esteemed [Farhad Manjoo](https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2018\/11\/28\/technology\/how-to-survive-the-next-era-of-tech-slow-down-and-be-mindful.html) - has just [concluded a five-year-long technology column](https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2018\/11\/28\/technology\/how-to-survive-the-next-era-of-tech-slow-down-and-be-mindful.html) with some essential (if perhaps a bit unoriginal) advice: \"**just slow down**.\" If you're still following along, you shall surely enjoy clicking some of his links, and I would certainly encourage that you do until you're out of free articles, at least. When Manjoo speaks, Apple listens: his January decree for Apple to bend with the industry wind and build \"[a Less Addictive iPhone](https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2018\/01\/17\/technology\/apple-addiction-iphone.html)\" is convincingly prophetic considering **Screen Time** - probably the most mulled-over iOS 12 addition. As someone who was diagnosed with Attention Deficit Disorder (however much or little that may mean to you) just one or two years after I began using my\/the first iPhone, I've developed a history of what he might call *Addiction* to iPhones in variable oscillation [touching both extremes](https:\/\/twitter.com\/NeoYokel\/status\/1042825995546320896). I carried my first-generation iPhone for almost 5 years - as you can imagine, it was far from a 100%-functional device toward the end of that bell curve. In contrast, I've also stood in line at dawn for two iPhone launches, jailbroken, listened to podcasts *only* about apps (far before they were good,) and been compelled to chronicle and reflect upon all of it for as long as I can remember.\n\nThere's no denying that the iPhone has had a profound effect on my life mostly thanks to my own choices, which is why it's worth telling the vast majority of you that features like Screen Time will never help you achieve whatever vague conception of *reduced usage* you may have. If you haven't yet quantified the figures you'll find within it in mental estimates, you aren't really concerned at all and if you *have*, Screen Time will only confirm them. Using reminder notifications to optimize your appflow makes no attempt at all to actually escape the mentality of the behavior you seek to lessen from yourself. Another app is still another app; a notification reminding you to stop using an app does nothing but add still more stimuli. If you want to stop using the phone so much, ***stop* using the fucking phone**. If you are truly concerned about how your handset companion has changed your life, turn it off for a week\/month\/quarter - however long you *possibly* can. By that, I mean no more or less than what you can manage without getting fired\/dumped\/expelled\/etc. If you have *truly* reached this point, anything less is probably worth it. There is simply no other way to get a clear picture of how it's changed you.\n\nGoogle, Facebook, and the rest of the industry are well aware of this, but know they can't *actually* advocate against the fundamental mechanism that drives their businesses, so they express concern by doing what they know: **building more software**. Apple is in a slightly different situation: they still need you to buy their phones - and even to look at them - but not past the point of hurting yourself emotionally, mentally, or physically because those injuries tend to hurt one *economically*. Screen Time's purpose is to keep us thriving and buying, but the only effective solve for this can only be communicated in garbage cinema language: **you must find it within yourself**. I am *actually* the worst person from which to model your life, except perhaps for my iPhone use: unless there's little else worthy of my attention, my phone is not out. Even if checking my [emails](mailto:davidblue@gmail.com), [Mastodon](https:\/\/mastodon.social\/@DavidBlue), [Twitter](https:\/\/twitter.com\/neoyokel), etc. are my default tasks, there are infinitely many besides that come first. Every once in a while, it's okay to finish an important message while walking down the street or waiting at a stoplight if things are urgent, but I can guarantee you that my attention is better consolidated on traveling in 95% of cases - moving with purpose and then focusing on my composition *after* I've arrived is almost always more efficient. I realize that I'm cowboying it here and sound like your Dad, but I'm better with iOS than he is, yet I've never publicly run into anything while looking down at my smartphone in 10 years of hardcore use. **Find somebody who's company makes you forget about all of this for hours at a time and treasure them**. Also: **stop playing games on your phone**. *What the hell are you doing*? Read a blog! Explore the wonders of the open web! Your peers, your battery, and your elderly future self with thank you for it. (One exception is playing word\/trivia games with your partner. That's very cute and good for you.)\n\n*I was elated to see that even Apple supports my [age-old cause for Twitter Lists](https:\/\/twitter.com\/i\/moments\/996616971880882176). Also, the new function in Apple Music allowing the user to search by lyrics [appears to work very well](https:\/\/twitter.com\/NeoYokel\/status\/1042825995546320896)...*\n\nTo get back to specifics, the **new Photos application** is now basically what it should have been all along, [3D Touch has been virtually eclipsed](https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/circuitbreaker\/2018\/9\/24\/17896228\/ios-12-keyboard-trackpad-cursor-3d-touch-iphone-ipad) for those strange bastards among you who never liked it, and the release's most democratically-redeemable feature is **optimization**, which even on my iPhone 8 Plus was blatantly noticeable and very welcome. However, probably the best insight to come out of my long, rambly *End User* review was the revelation that basically any other human activity is a better use of time than [applauding Apple](https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2018\/9\/17\/17862236\/ios-12-review-download-features-update-speed-iphone-ipad-screen-time-notifications-siri) for learning to hold new features off until they've been thoroughly tested and focusing instead on smoothing existing software. In fact, I'd argue there is absolutely no reason for someone like me to say anything even remotely positive about the world's wealthiest company ever again, though that doesn't apply to *The Verge* or Chaim Gartenberg, who's review - for the record - was much more useful to 9999 times more people than anything I'll ever write. However, isn't it sortof unreasonable to expect anything but *absolute perfection* from Apple at this trillion-dollar juncture? A handful of varying interpretations of absolute perfection per product category, even.\n\nWith gorgeous, iCloud-enabled premium apps like [Bear](https:\/\/twitter.com\/NeoYokel\/status\/1063486573197561857) in the picture, integrating wholly into the Apple environment has maintained its relative rank above the alternatives to its specific minimal-esque utilitarian *niceness* which appeals so strongly to *those people* among both consumer and professional buyers. Readers from within this culture recognized a short time ago that [iOS is in the process of replacing MacOS](https:\/\/www.wired.co.uk\/article\/ipad-pro-2018-review) as the star component of this environment across the board, though there's at least a moderate journey ahead before it truly reaches this achievement for the median user. For myself, iOS 12 improved the experience of using my 8 Plus and certainly gave me something intriguing to play with in Siri Shortcuts. For the rest of the world's billions of daily iOS users, I say *be as insatiable as possible* - always expect more.\n\n<!--comment-->\n\n#software #automation","views":1542,"updated":"2023-03-23T14:09:56Z","tags":["software","automation"],"type":null,"title":"Profound Revelations in iOS 12","slug":"siri-shortcuts-ios12-review","appearance":"norm","language":"en","rtl":false,"created":"2018-12-05T11:00:00Z","images":["https:\/\/i.snap.as\/ShVoCP3.png"],"collection":{"public":false,"alias":"bilge","total_posts":0,"title":"The Psalms","verification_link":"","description":"A <a href=\"https:\/\/davidblue.wtf\/db.vcf\">narcoleptic yokel<\/a> on software and culture.","style_sheet":"","views":177027,"monetization_pointer":""},"paid":false},{"id":"e4zz1290vwzk69dr","body":"![Chuck Klosterman](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/86yvtbj.png)\n\n## The genius of one Chuck continues to perform to the refreshing benefit of scholars in American culture.\n\n<!--more-->\n\n<audio controls>\n  <source src=\"https:\/\/davidblue.wtf\/audio\/chuck.mp3\">\n<\/audio>\n\nThanks to [an episode of Peter Kafka's](https:\/\/www.recode.net\/2017\/8\/22\/16184520\/transcript-writer-chuck-klosterman-music-sports-recode-media) [*Recode Media*](https:\/\/www.recode.net\/2017\/8\/22\/16184520\/transcript-writer-chuck-klosterman-music-sports-recode-media), I've just now discovered that former *New York Times Magazine* Ethicist, author of *Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs*, and longtime men's interest media-affiliated sports and music columnist Chuck Klosterman pronounces his surname *kloa-ster-men* instead of *klaw-ster-men* as *I* have been, shamefully – even within earshot of other human beings on a handful of occasions. I am willing to submit myself for punishment for these transgressions under the single condition that I be allowed to call him *Cuck Klusterfuck* the next time he ends a spoken sentence with \"or whatever\" in an interview – an unfortunate habit he's [maintained for years](https:\/\/youtu.be\/NMzPX-MERbU). If my own byline had any pedigree in the world of literary criticism, I would now collect his penance simply by including those hateful, 90s stoner-kid buzzwords in every quote, unedited, but it most certainly does not. I've searched moderately hard for any reason to bother contributing any criticism of books or their authors and returned with very little. I've read *The Broom of the System* and *White Girls* this year, yes, but I'd have to be a [Fuck Boy](http:\/\/www.revelist.com\/books\/books-fuckboys-read\/3289) to write anything about David Foster Wallace, and [Hilton Als’ elegant, genre-busting masterpiece](https:\/\/www.interviewmagazine.com\/culture\/hilton-als-white-girls) is so far beyond both my societal rights and perceptive capacity that I wouldn't dare utter a single editorialized peep about it – aside from a log line-length recommendation – even under immediate threat of certain death.\n\nGiven my recent [voluntary relocation to Portland, Oregon](https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/p\/BhArAZNF6W7\/) and the word-y pursuits on which I choose to spend all of my money and energy, I should adore everything about Chuck Klosterman and in turn he should be completely invisible across the under-30 demographic, yet I’ve found a special originality in his voice since first exploring it and I think it might be worth requalification. A good friend of mine once dug his [first novel](https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2009\/01\/04\/books\/review\/Meehan-t.html) [*Downtown Owl*](https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2009\/01\/04\/books\/review\/Meehan-t.html) out of a bulk box of bargain books she’d bought as a preteen, long ago and became an enthusiastic fan of his perspective and a harsh, but fond critic of his persona. It was her copy of his second that I read first: [*The Visible Man*](https:\/\/www.npr.org\/2011\/10\/04\/141015210\/visible-man-asks-what-if-no-one-were-watching) – ultimately a surprisingly-original take on the *psychologist of a gifted outcast* tale that classically exemplifies the easy-to-digest yet thoughtfully-exploratory reputation of his craft. Thanks to her library card, I was able to follow it up immediately with Chuck’s latest, most topical work – an anthology of past essays written for publications like *The Guardian*, *Grantland*, and *GQ* entitled *X: A Highly Specific, Defiantly Incomplete History of the Early 21st Century*, which proved an impossibly entertaining, even more polished execution of The Quaint Chuck’s Explanations in non-fiction form, beginning at onset with refreshing brevity in its [introduction](http:\/\/bit.ly\/ckintro).\n\n> I’m not fully accredited by either side of the professional equation (sportswriters think I’m too pretentious and music writers don’t think I’m pretentious enough,) but I’m able to write about whatever I want, as long as it actually happened.\n\nUsing “pretentious” even when just vaguely and loosely expressing other readers’ thoughts about your work is the first of many miniscule technical infractions against convention laid down in *X*’s arrangement which proves to act toward the benefit of its experience. If you substitute *car nerds* for *sportswriters*, I’d personally identify with this picoautobiography in a big way, but more importantly as a *reader* I had never encountered anything written about sports which I would describe as *pretentious*, per se, and that realization could very well have birthed enough curiosity to land the sale, had I been skimming in a bookshop, which I would’ve eventually been pleased with.\n\nNow, during what we should hope to be the first dawn of a new microera of sincerity, we must recognize how valuable it is for Klosterman as an observer to be comfortably engaged with his subjects, emotionally, and confident in the value of his commentary in middleage without the need to insist upon his eccentricity, as so many cringey, culturally-daft Dads do, these days. He uses keywords in his writing and spoken publicity that *should* dismiss him immediately as one of these – a nostalgic, out-of-time dork – but are instead somehow magically manipulated to *serve* him in articulating reasonable, even profoundly-innovative insight. As I have explored his bibliography and his publicly-expressed thoughts, I have been caught up and hinged on a single supposition: **Chuck Klosterman is the only white, 46-year-old bearded Portland Dad you should be reading**. Do mind that I am in no way exempt from this lens, but it’s still my job to determine his viability as an intellectual – a “thought leader,” even – for those of us who were conceived around the same time he was wrapping up his collegiate sentence at the University of North Dakota.\n\nFor a solid hunk of the American reading audience, a quick, elemental vector of quality and mastery we look for in an essayist is the ability to “transcend” their subject matter for even the most presumptuous and conceited among us, usually to deliver a more abstract sentiment to leave with. Here, Klosterman’s significant career experience is irrefutably evident – in *X*, he achieves this transcendence organically with a fluidity unlike anything I’ve read before. We can already check a single box: convincing even a young professional twenty-something to shell out for a physical hardback of contemporary non-fiction requiring any sort of academic effort to consume is going to be nigh-impossible, even though *X* actually happens to be the best-looking specimen of print product design I have ever handled across cover, type, and layout. It’s been difficult having to convince myself to give this copy back.\n\nIn the interest of full disclosure, I must take special care to emphasize [just how highly](http:\/\/www.extratone.com\/?s=recode media) I regard Peter Kafka as editor and interviewer extraordinaire within the Media beat – well-proven to be capable of hitting consistently hard on both [novel](https:\/\/www.recode.net\/2017\/8\/10\/16115548\/patreon-jack-conte-fan-pledges-subscription-paywall-recode-media-peter-kafka-podcast) and [old guard](https:\/\/www.recode.net\/2018\/2\/1\/16957324\/wired-paywall-nick-thompson-magazine-advertising-subscription-peter-kafka-recode-media-podcast) industry personalities with refined, [seemingly unimpeachable](https:\/\/www.recode.net\/2018\/5\/22\/17380908\/youtube-music-launch-10-lyor-cohen-interview-peter-kafka-recode-media-kanye-west-childish-gambino) stone-faced skepticism. However, this Chuck Klosterman interview for *Recode Media* is an uncharacteristically disarmed display of serious admiration: he introduces *X* with an outright confession: \"It’s great. I bought it. I bought a signed copy,\" which is an unexpected oddity (though not an unwelcome one – I’m glad Peter enjoys his life.) Their conversation dips briefly in personal history (Chuck and his wife moved to Portland from Brooklyn for its proximity to family) before plopping down upon the substance of his clearly superb and matter-of-fact interview technique. I’m not sure I’ve ever heard a conversation between Kafka and any previous guests with whom he was quite so obviously alike in general disposition.\n\n> The only reason I’m able to ask you these questions is because I’m a reporter and I can ask you questions now that I probably wouldn’t feel comfortable asking you if we were friends, so I’m not going to pretend that we are and I’m not going to create some fake thing where we’re going to have a relationship beyond this conversation. I’m just going to ask you the things I want to know about and I hope that you respect the fact that I’m just being straight with you. I find that that works much better.\n\nFrom the broadest possible pop cultural lens, Chuck's most spectacular and widely-circulated work, demographically (I assume) is his [2015 interview and cover story](https:\/\/www.gq.com\/story\/taylor-swift-gq-cover-story) for *GQ* with Taylor Swift – then \"the most popular human alive.\" Yes, it really *is* worth dwelling on the image: ***this guy***... this very Dorky Dad, just hanging out with the most highly-demanded teen idol who's ever lived, sitting awkwardly next to her in the backseat of her car as she maniacally panics to accept a call from Justin Timberlake. When one Chucks such a distinguished contrast upon such a high-profile contemporary medium, the weight of the potential scrutiny becomes palpable, but Klosterman anticipates and braces for this (very risky) business in the only manner he can: acknowledging it over and over and *over* again in the second paragraph of his every interview appearance.\n\n> It doesn’t matter if it was complimentary or insulting necessarily. It would seem as though I wasn’t taking her seriously as a musical artist, and the idea is that I do. That’s why I’m writing about her is because I do think she’s a meaningful, significant artist. It’s not worth the risk of having the story then get shifted by other people who perhaps just perceive themselves as somebody who’s a watchdog for certain signifiers or certain elements of the culture and that their job is to be on the watch for this. If your story then gets moved into that silo, that’s all it’s going to be remembered for... It’s a touchier thing now. It’s a more dangerous thing.\n\nIn the [print itself](http:\/\/bit.ly\/ckswiftpreface), the cover story is prefaced by a very short but uncomfortably-telling complaint about changing expectations for culture writers. One might reasonably suggest that Klosterman regards the practice of calling out or remarking on “creepy misogyny” as “dumb” – nothing but the byproduct of changing “times.”\n\n> Something you may notice in the following 2015 feature on Taylor Swift is that I never describe what she looks like or how she was dressed, even though I almost always do that with any celebrity I cover... If I did, it would be reframed as creepy misogyny and proof that I didn't take the woman seriously as an artist. It would derail everything else about the story. It would **become** the story.\n\nBut… *is it*? Note how desperately close his language comes to the *common white guy whining about feminism* classification without *actually* fitting the bill. Right…? It *doesn’t*? Surely, it must be certified Awake through some combination of keywords or format I’m unfamiliar with or unable to visually register because Klosterman’s ass would have long been grass, otherwise. These 224 words are *X*’s most contentious, which you could call impressive, all things considered – he appears to care enough about his public image to curate it somewhat diligently. When a motherhood blogger published [an open letter](https:\/\/atypicalson.com\/2013\/11\/07\/an-open-letter-to-chuck-klosterman-the-new-york-times-ethicist\/) in 2013 citing three very ableist uses of the R-word in his work, it only took him two days to [respond](https:\/\/www.huffingtonpost.com\/kari-wagnerpeck\/i-am-the-author-of-the-op_b_4319577.html): “I was wrong. You are right.”\n\nMore than any other writer of his demographic, **Chuck Klosterman has a close, wary relationship with the everchanging contextual boundaries of public expression**. He knows when to be transparent with his feelings on progression, and he's careful to avoid what could be \"problematic\" for the sake of functioning better as a writer (I assume.) For *Slate*'s *I Have to Ask* podcast, he managed to [speak extensively](https:\/\/slate.com\/news-and-politics\/2018\/02\/chuck-klosterman-on-how-the-approach-to-cultural-criticism-has-completely-flipped.html) about these mechanisms for nearly an hour without bellowing anything definitively cringey.\n\n> I can’t say it’s better or worse. It’s just different, and because it’s different, it makes me feel uncomfortable, but there’s actually like an adversarial relationship with the history of anything, and that somehow that history is seen as oppressive. And you shouldn’t even know about it. It’s better to live in now.\n\nA quick jaunt from pretty horrendous to almost-ideal, then. If we are to place our faith in Chuck as our last bearded champion, we must hope that last sentence is sincerely intended to be his lens to the changing world. Granted – even if it *is* the truth – it’s not as if persistent acknowledgement of one’s position can miraculously wash away any systematic patriarchal dynamics involved in authoring (or reading, for that matter) a high-profile feature of a young woman on cover of a magazine which explicitly seeks most to speak to \"[all sides of the male equation](http:\/\/www.condenast.com\/brands\/gq\/),\" (are you *sure about* *that*, Condé Nast?) especially considering how unlikely it would've been for me to read anything about Taylor Swift outside of this very white man's anthology. Fundamental themes of power and control are threaded throughout both his fiction and non-fiction, which is especially prevalent in the Macho Big Boy cultures of the athletics and music industries. In profiling Taylor Swift – the undisputed apex of the latter in 2015 – Klosterman provided a firsthand account of the grueling maintenance of a public and private personality under tremendous strain from said factors as they were magnified to the max by the most extreme celebrity.\n\n> Here we see Swift’s circuitous dilemma: Any attempt to appear less calculating scans as even more calculated. Because Swift’s professional career has unspooled with such precision, it’s assumed that her social life is no less premeditated.\n\nI’m right there with Chuck: I’ve even found a fundamental pillar in Power and Control relationships supporting my own fiction experiments: **how we attain them**, **how we lose them**, and **how best to make use of them** – all of which had apparently been quite problematic for Taylor Swift for most of her adult life, though we wouldn’t be allowed to *really* comprehend how deep her inner turmoil had drilled until it overwhelmed even her expertly-designed self-control four years later, [boiling over entirely](https:\/\/youtu.be\/3tmd-ClpJxA) with such unexpected violence that all of America’s pseudorural glam-pop-country-glossy-chode-hipsters let out a simultaneous, dangerously-alarmed holler of *OH FOR PETE’S SAKE* that was actually heard and recorded from the overflying orbit of the International Space Station.\n\n> It’s somehow different when the hub of the wheel is Swift. People get skeptical. Her famous friends are marginalized as acquisitions, selected to occupy specific roles, almost like members of the Justice League ('the ectomorph model,' 'the inventive indie artist,' 'the informed third-wave feminist,' etc.). Such perceptions perplex Swift, who is genuinely obsessed with these attachments.\n\nNo, it’s not *only* worthwhile as an exercise in superbly athletic self-awareness – the Taylor profile is profound. I’d recommend reading and treasuring it with or without the rest of the anthology because bizarre intersections like these are rare to come by from anybody else. Short, sharp, and occasionally somewhat petty notions are what Chuck Klosterman does best and most originally. Thanks to a digression of Kafka’s beginning with “you and I are about the same age…,” he arrives (by way of REM, believe it or not) at a significant statement about youth and identity.\n\n> It seems strange to me to be into music for its coolness outside of high school. That seems like that’s the only time when you’re a young person and you’re using art basically to create a personality because you don’t have a real personality yet.\n\nKlosterman is debatably exempt from the traditional academic abstract of “objectivity” for the vast majority of his notable work because of its stated primary subject: his “interior life.” Perhaps the success of his voice could be at least partially attributed to his development of an existential muscle – a perspective unique enough to entertain, yet no less recognizably Midwestern with which he’s been able to reflect particularly clearly on the profession in tandem with the experience he’s accumulated over the course of his career.\n\n> You know, when you’re young, you’re a real emotional writer if you’re a writer… If I was a young person now, I would be incredibly attracted to the idea that when you’re 22 you can be a national writer, which was impossible when I was 22.\n\nIn a way, Klosterman does surmise that it *was* indeed its objectivity that media lost, and that writing is no longer a “one-way relationship,” but a sort of ridiculous dance in which “many people feel the reason they’re consuming media is to respond to it… that it’s not for the content.” I would remind old Chuck that there are very few functioning adults outside of academia or retirement in the United States who spend much of their time reading anything solely for the sake of absorption, and the disparity between those who were and weren’t was exponentially greater in the past. The story of American media is defined by its cycles of waning and waxing democratization, but many of the more traditional avenues in the business have bet on the “two-way relationship” to keep them relevant.\n\nMy own favorite chapter of the collection is a [2500-word personal essay](http:\/\/grantland.com\/features\/space-time-dvr-mechanics\/) constructed for *Grantland* to answer a single incongruity: “**Why is watching a prerecorded sporting event less pleasurable than watching the same game live**?” Some form of this question has at least mildly troubled every American since the 1960s, including myself, and Klosterman manages to provide an entertaining and concise analysis of this plight through his own wisdom. In its [short preface](http:\/\/bit.ly\/ckdepressed) in the volume – which was written “in 2008, in Europe, when [Chuck] was pretend depressed” is the story of his encounter with a house-painting stranger, to whom he explains the meter for success in his opinion-manufacturing profession, as he sees it: “If a large number of strangers seem to think one of my opinions is especially true or wildly wrong, there is somehow a perception that I am succeeding at this vocation.”\n\n> Last weekend I was in a hashish bar in Amsterdam. It was post-dusk, pre-night. The music was terrible (fake reggae, late-period Eric Clapton, Sublime deep cuts.) I was sitting next to a British stranger with a shaved head and a speech impediment. Our conversation required subtitles, so I imagined them in my mind. He told me he had lost three family members within the past year: his mother, who was sixty-six; his uncle, who was fifty-six; and his sister, who was forty-six. He said he'd just turned thirty-six. He asked if I saw a pattern developing. \"Yes,\" I said. \"But only numerically.\"\n> I asked what he did for a living. He said he was a housepainter. He asked me the same question about myself. “I manufacture opinions,” I said.\n> “Really?” he asked. “How do you know if you’re any good at that?”\n> “By the number of people who agree or disagree,” I said in response. “If a large number of strangers seem to think one of my opinions is especially true or wildly wrong, there is somehow a perception that I am succeeding at this vocation.”\n> “That’s interesting,” said the bald British man who could barely speak. “I guess house painting is a totally different thing.”\n\nRarely are situations or discussions that begin with *back in my day* actually constructive in any sense, but Chuck Klosterman appears to be the exception. If you’re willing to indulge him, you may find yourself reassured. He now writes from a remote cabin (with WiFi,) was tortured – like all of us – in sifting through and compiling his old work for *X*, and finds its index to be his favorite part.\n\n> Exploring the index from a book you created is like having someone split your head open with an axe so that you can peruse the contents of your brain.\n\nHe is [willfully and completely ignorant of the *Harry Potter* franchise](https:\/\/www.esquire.com\/entertainment\/a3556\/klosterman1107), yet able to sincerely [witness and convey](http:\/\/grantland.com\/features\/taking-concert-doubleheader-creed-nickelback-world-most-hated-bands\/) the nuances of back-to-back Creed and Nickelback concerts in a confident, fascinating technique of which any other music or culture writer would deprive you. He is “almost embarrassed” by his [emotional attachment](http:\/\/bit.ly\/exrfastnet) to the Charlie Brown peanuts. (See: [Chuck Klosterman on Charlie Brown](https:\/\/paper.dropbox.com\/doc\/Chuck-Klosterman-on-Charlie-Brown-7jHNnij3saNFwtHt9Nika).)\n\n> I haven't watched A Charlie Brown Christmas in at least twenty-five years, solely because I can't emotionally reconcile the final scene.\n\nYou’ll notice that his entire answer to the live television debacle is – again – entirely about control (or the lack thereof.) In fact, his relationship with and desire for control also contributed to his choice of profession.\n\n> Part of the reason I became a writer is because it was this completely controlled reality where I could do this thing by myself where you’d go out and you’d do the interviews and stuff, but then you’re back by yourself, transcribing and then writing. Then, when the story is done and you send it off, that’s the end. Now that’s the middle. Now it’s like, when the story is published, it’s the middle of the process very often because the consumer feels differently now.\n\nWhile Klosterman’s voice is pleasant to someone like me, neither it nor himself necessarily belong to The People. In his [*X* review for *Paste Magazine*](https:\/\/www.pastemagazine.com\/articles\/2017\/05\/x-chuck-klosterman.html), B. David Zarley proclaims essays to be “a love letter to a moment,” concluding that Chuck is “’effectively narcissistic,’ proving that culture essays can teach us something about ourselves *and* the people around us.” [For *The Washington Post*](https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/opinions\/sportswriter-and-rock-n-roll-philosopher-treading-two-sides-of-opposite-worlds\/2017\/06\/30\/3aba0fb8-23a5-11e7-bb9d-8cd6118e1409_story.html), Justin Wm. Moyer notes “it’s hard to think of another writer who could make a 30-page, deeply reported essay about a North Dakota junior-college basketball game interesting,” suggesting that this new collection marks Klosterman’s ascendance from **critic** to **philosopher**. From what I’ve read to date, I would counter that he has always fulfilled the term to the extent of its usefulness in the 21st century and is even now beginning to redefine it. Last January, he braved the “dystopic” Google Gates to [speak critically for a crowd of Googlers](https:\/\/youtu.be\/HhGA9e-OiFY), describing them as “an umbrella over the entire culture,” and urging caution and reflection in the coming future to keep them from doing “something bad.” His engagement with them – especially during [the Q&A](https:\/\/youtu.be\/HhGA9e-OiFY?t=36m35s) – is a fascinating insight into the Greater Google Mind, and I would encourage any invested parties in Chuck Klosterman’s role as a philosopher to watch the talk in full. I was unfamiliar with “the boat-sails-wind analogy” before I read [James Murphy’s interview](https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/music\/2010\/apr\/24\/lcd-soundsystem-this-is-happening) for LCD Soundsystem’s “last album.”\n\n> Your life is a boat, the sails are your emotions, and drugs are the wind. When you're a kid, your boat is small and your sail is huge, and drugs are like a hurricane.\n\n**Control x Time = the Klosterman beat**. I suppose this must be what other entertainment writers are referring to when they [accuse Chuck of nostalgia trafficking](http:\/\/www.dallasobserver.com\/arts\/pop-culture-critic-chuck-klosterman-talks-about-his-new-essay-collection-x-9559383), but I can’t be so sure. Though I’d like to think my own snout for the stuff is especially well-tuned, I am undeniably from a different planet – even auditorily. All but one or two of the musicians interviewed throughout *X* were entirely unknown to me by name, which Klosterman’s voice managed to make even more compelling – *not to mention* the included stories of athletes and the sports industry, which include stories of the human ego, paranoia, and complex drama that always manage to transcend their setting when articulated with such dexterity.\n\nI’ve never before written a book review of any sort – nor am I defensibly qualified to compare culture writers – but with good ole’ Chuck, I dove much further in order to tackle one very important question: **should Klosterman be recommended reading for anyone under 30** above or alongside bestsellers like George Saunders or groundbreaking essayists of color like Hilton Als? In many a case, I must conclude by saying, simply, that *something* of value would be forgone if we shunned Chuck, even if his insight is old news to all but the most rudimentary yokels. I have little to offer women or people of color, but I’d bet *X* would prove itself worth a library trip for any idiot white guys in their lives who may be falling far behind. I don’t know of any other voices who are in a better position to introduce these issues, nor any who are quite so practiced at handling them delicately. While Jenna Wortham-level readers will gain little to nothing from this examination or the ecology of its subject (and will likely find themselves pausing momentarily for a deserved jest before moving on and returning to their high-level plane of complex neoliberal commentary,) but most of their less-aWoken fathers should find in Chuck a man they can truly trust, who manages to consistently distill and articulate the need-to-knows of the most complex pop culture and pop science conversations without using any of the academic language found in most institutional discourse which daddy finds too condescending and superfluous to bear. Those readers who’ve absolutely fucking *despised* my voice so far in this essay should give Klosterman a go – I take as much time as I can muster to fiddle with and season the words in context like this work because **I basically \\*enjoy\\* the bullshit**, yet I’ve found both *X* and *But What If We’re Wrong?* remarkably refreshing and impressive exercises. \n\n> [These are] the cultural conditions in which I was raised under and which I pursued journalism under. That was part of the thing that drew me to the idea of being a reporter was I was like, this is something I can do, I think. My ability to detach my personal emotions from what I am investigating, while not perfect, I can do this. And now it turns out that the opposite is what’s desirable. I think it’s really going to change the kind of person who goes into media going forward.\n\nReading Chuck Klosterman is going to be perturbing, but true sincerity is almost always uncomfortable. Comprehensively, his nonfiction represents perhaps the most important possible behavior to encourage from both the critic and his readership because it incubates and exudes **sincere curiosity** and a **genuine interest in learning to listen**. From the perspective of quantified societal contribution, I’d argue that Klosterman’s craft is a significantly more honorable and worthwhile pursuit than greater academic literature in its unique and entertaining treatment of subjects the establishment tends to pulverize into minutia. Unless he’s broke and\/or bookish, buy *X* as a gift for your Dad and at least give it a try when he’s done. If nothing else, *at least* **read the Taylor Swift interview**, okay? If he doesn’t enjoy the book, I’m always available if one or both of you need to blow off some steam: **give me a call at (573) 823-4380**. (*Normal text messaging \/ talktime rates will apply*.)\n\n#media #spectacle\n\n<!--comment-->","views":1606,"updated":"2023-05-27T21:28:53Z","tags":["media","spectacle"],"type":null,"title":"The Case for Chuck Klosterman","slug":"chuck-klosterman-x","appearance":"norm","language":"en","rtl":false,"created":"2018-12-12T02:00:00Z","images":["https:\/\/i.snap.as\/86yvtbj.png"],"collection":{"public":false,"alias":"bilge","total_posts":0,"title":"The Psalms","verification_link":"","description":"A <a href=\"https:\/\/davidblue.wtf\/db.vcf\">narcoleptic yokel<\/a> on software and culture.","style_sheet":"","views":177027,"monetization_pointer":""},"paid":false},{"id":"70fhvbv9is3m71qy","body":"#### by [David Blue](http:\/\/twitter.com\/neoyokel)\n\n![Surface Laptop 2](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/Py8bIP7.jpg)\n\nAssuming Jesus Christ is in your thoughts this evening before yet another anniversary of his birth, I am infinitely astonished by the truth in what I’m about to suppose with you. If the Son of God was living today, most of us have agreed for a long time now that he’d use marijuana recreationally – big fuckin whoop. I think it’s far more interesting and appropriate (we all know his birthday was [wholly reconfigured into a consumerist holiday](https:\/\/www.thisamericanlife.org\/47\/christmas-and-commerce) long ago) to speculate on how he’d behave after finding himself inadvertently in the market for a new laptop within the ~$1000 range (following a *stubbed toe whilst walking on water* incident, perhaps.) Surely, it would not be entirely holy for him to opt in to the Foxconn-complicit world of Apple, Incorporated, nor the [openly-blasphemous](http:\/\/www.extratone.com\/tech\/google\/) one created and exuberantly grown by Google LLC, and I’m afraid he’d be too much of an *End User* idiot to integrate any of the sparse Linux-dedicated hardware available. In May of 2017, however, Billy Gates’ old Microsoft finally released “[the laptop we’ve always wanted them to make](https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2017\/5\/5\/15557738\/vergecast-podcast-255-microsoft-surface-laptop-samsung-dex-i-clicked-the-doc),” but could its recent update be truly worthy of our Lourde and Saviour? Or your newly-enrolled offspring? Should you sprint downstairs and swap out the new MacBook Air you just bought?\n\n<iframe sandbox=\"allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-top-navigation allow-popups\" scrolling=no width=\"100%\" height=\"185\" frameborder=\"0\" src=\"https:\/\/embed.radiopublic.com\/e?if=end-user-WdbezM&ge=s1!fb997569626371bb19366d2dc0e4a0be2793e9b4\"><\/iframe>\n\nFrom an entirely valid perspective, an observer might declare my last two months of 2018 to be an outright shameful period defined by hypocrisy and traitorous betrayals. After finally taking the time to explore the full narrative surrounding Linux and the bloody tale of Microsoft’s cruel genocidal destruction of countless creative software projects throughout computing’s adolescence (see: “[Embrace, Extend, Extinguish](https:\/\/youtu.be\/TVHcdgrqbHE?t=425),”) I eventually declared myself “100% Open Source” and began outlining an essay designed primarily to express that *Linux is finally ready to be the operating system of the people* without succumbing immediately to the brand of cybercrackpot illegitimacy associated with the L-word in the minds of the general public so readily thanks to decades of misinformed, condescending neckbeards. Such a feat would require entire new planes of cultural awareness and dialectal delicacy, yet certainly result in zero personal reward from even the best possible outcome, yet I proceeded to ponder the subject very deliberately all the way through October because I genuinely believed in a new democratized future of computing. 2018 had been my Grand Awakening to the idyllic possibilities of Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) across the whole applied spectrum from office suites to [social networks](http:\/\/bilge.world\/federated\/), yet – as two thousand eighteen comes to an end – I’ve managed to find myself among the most [jaded, soul-sapped](https:\/\/youtu.be\/O0RSeFcv3Qs) tech community I have yet encountered: **Microsoft Administrators**.\n\nComplimenting this Linux-laden culture in which I was not so long ago deeply embedded was a confused and frustrated outlook regarding what I felt were excessive and completely idiotic sacrifices across the industry’s hardware design to the greedy, gluttonous god of Lightness. It seemed only reasonable to Myself As Consumer that the entire buying public should exclusively seek designs prioritizing greatest possible performance and battery life, even from portable computers and smartphones, so I assumed my perspective on this updated iteration of Microsoft's most laptopy Surface laptop – which exists in large part to [compete directly with](https:\/\/www.pcmag.com\/news\/364728\/spec-down-apple-macbook-air-vs-microsoft-surface-laptop-2) Apple's beloved (and just-updated) MacBook Air – wouldn't be at all useful. However, a few weeks ago, my employer prompted me with a sweet sweet ultimatum: *for the sake of a tax break, I want to spend ~$1000 on a laptop for you as soon as possible*. Yes, I know I should consider myself a very fortunate man - this [wasn't even the first time](http:\/\/bilge.world\/hp-spectre-x360-best-buy-consumerism\/) I'd been surprised with the \"hey, I want to buy you a laptop but it has to be today\" experience, and may even be considered a sort of sequel to my *Tales of Whirlwind Manic Consumerism*, but it’s ultimately one of the most idiotic strategies to achieve a major purchase decision and completely inadvisable for anyone on a budget. Still I was indeed thankful to be put in a nearly-identical situation of Consumer Electronic haste, and have come to be especially appreciative of the specific time I was approached as such: just one week after [Microsoft launched the Surface Laptop 2](https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2018\/10\/16\/17979516\/microsoft-surface-laptop-2-review-specs-price-features-windows-10).\n\nConsidering the vast majority of its users are [trapped inside my television](https:\/\/theoutline.com\/post\/2923\/the-popularity-of-microsoft-surface-is-the-least-realistic-thing-on-television), there’s no harm in covering the Surface brand with our virtual palm for a moment. If you’ll indulge me so, you’ll notice that Microsoft has actually delivered unto us **The Laptop II** – as in, the sequel... the *successor* to *every other laptop computer* yet conceived... but does this one machine truly represent the second coming of the *Notebook Christ*? Naturally, it would be a bit zealous to stand behind this extreme statement with 100% sincerity, but there truly *are* certain elements of this Personal Computing product's execution which do indeed will its user to expect and\/or desire from others in coming years. As I've stated before, I also simply cannot help but be jazzed by such bravado from the mouths of even a company with as crooked and hateful history as Microsoft's. (Note: no other technology company has actually achieved what Microsoft historically has in this regard, and hopefully none ever will again.)\n\nI must be honest: it hasn't yet been two months and I've already scuffed and perhaps even *stained* the beautiful maroon alcantara surrounding my machine’s touchable body, but it’s occurred to me that I might draw upon the vast library of [automotive interior tutorials](https:\/\/youtu.be\/PM-FbFIBoCs) available on YouTube – and even purchase some of the alcantara care-specific products they recommend – in order to *really* maintain the exterior of the Laptop II. After all, [alcantara was undeniably car culture’s material first](https:\/\/www.popularmechanics.com\/cars\/a9653\/what-is-alcantara\/). I should also confess that objectively, the Surface Laptop II is the best-suited computer for *my personal uses* that I’ve ever owned *or* used for any length of time. Subjectively, I don’t think all of the hardware design touches that make it so – like its keyboard layout, divine 3:2 aspect ratio, and particular I\/O complement – have yet had the chance to seduce my emotional brain into truly *loving* it as much as I certainly should by any reasonable measure. For my own sake, I hope I’m able to fall in child-like infatuation with its magic, but in the interim, I believe the coldness of my heart should hopefully preserve any useful commentary I might have to add. Though this is undoubtedly the most timely review of a hardware product I’ve ever published, I’d still ask that you indulge my perspective suggesting the importance of considering it part of a *package* with its operating system, considering that the whole of tech media would’ve unanimously declared it the year’s “[best laptop](https:\/\/mashable.com\/review\/microsoft-surface-laptop-2\/)” were Apple’s aging, but still widely-adored MacOS absent from the frame.\n\n> I've tested a bunch of laptops this year, running the spectrum of 2-in-1s, Chromebooks, MacBooks, gaming laptops, etc. Everyone's needs are going to be different, which is why there's no such thing as a one-size-fits-all for laptops. But enthusiasts’ laptops aside, I strongly feel the Surface Laptop 2 is the best laptop of the year. And by that I mean the best laptop for most folks' needs.\n\nWith as much humility as possible, I must add that I myself am *anything* but “most folks,” yet my experience so far with the product has been one of astonishing compatibility and battery life. Using recommended power settings, the Surface Laptop 2 endured [**four hours and twenty-two minutes**](https:\/\/twitter.com\/NeoYokel\/status\/1080514545062477825) of a workload it wasn’t particularly designed for including heavy web browsing, image manipulation, brief audio\/video capture with OBS, and moderate subsequent editing in Audacity and OpenShot. Dan Seifert – Vox Media’s “[only Windows user](https:\/\/www.recode.net\/2017\/5\/12\/15628228\/microsoft-surface-laptop-apple-macbook-air-windows-10s-dan-seifert-recode-podcast)” – reported “about seven hours” of Microsoft’s claimed 14.5, but frankly, I don’t know what any of y’all are doin – I’m just thankful this machine is a better marathoner than any other I can recall owning. While we’re on the subject, I consider Microsoft’s inclusion of a magnetically-attached power cable and unassuming auxiliary USB charging port on the attached power supply to be [personal godsends](http:\/\/bilge.world\/laptop-disabled-even-speedier-tone\/) – further evidence, even, that the Surface Laptop 2 was *actually designed to be nice to use*. For the sake of those readers **actually in the market for a new laptop** who’ve somehow found themselves here, though, Raymond Wong’s review for *Mashable* is the most thorough offering you’ll find – it’s quoted front and center on [Microsoft’s web page for the Laptop II](https:\/\/www.microsoft.com\/en-us\/p\/surface-laptop-2\/8XQJKK3DD91B), even – but it’s important to mention that his critical comparative perspective predates the late launch of its ultimate competitor, [the new MacBook Air](https:\/\/mashable.com\/review\/apple-macbook-air\/). Rather pitifully, however, his colleague’s “good, but not great” resolution suggests that Apple failed to challenge Microsoft’s relatively moderate update enough to warrant any revision, and that *Mashable* as a publication stands by my new laptop’s *Best of the Year* title, for whatever it may or may not be worth to you. \n\n> If the new [MacBook Air](https:\/\/zdcs.link\/zjWl1?pageview=06Fe2GZo26XvMYZgLndTadT) came in at the same price as the old one, it would be a steal. Sure, you pay for the privilege of being able to use macOS on the Apple ecosystem. But in years past that also meant access to cutting-edge features and design. As pretty as the MacBook Air is, there's nothing that innovative about it. In today's Apple, it seems, privilege amounts to just staying current.\n\nYou won’t find many others who regularly invest editorial merit in publishing 2500+ word laptop reviews anymore, which I’d concede is plenty reasonable in the Surface Laptop’s case, at least. Perhaps your first point of comparative entry should be [a barely-dated conversation](https:\/\/www.recode.net\/2017\/5\/12\/15628228\/microsoft-surface-laptop-apple-macbook-air-windows-10s-dan-seifert-recode-podcast) between Kara Swisher, Lauren Goode, and Dan Seifert on *Too Embarrassed to Ask* regarding the original’s odds of truly competing in the “premium laptop” segment (if you’d prefer to hear from those who struggle to take it seriously, that is.) Assuming [the original product direction of the Surface line](https:\/\/www.zdnet.com\/article\/what-oems-desperately-need-to-learn-from-microsofts-surface\/) still stands, Microsoft doesn’t actually intend to sell at high volume, especially when it comes to this runt of the marque, which does not hesitate to omit itself from the popular discourse of the moment surrounding tablets as the future of all computing to which all of its siblings have [contributed so much](https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2014\/5\/23\/5743416\/microsoft-surface-pro-3-review). Though I shall always remember my dearest Libel (the special edition Spectre x360 with which I built most of *Extratone*) with great respect and deep fondness – I think it’s even worth mounting on some sort of plinth – the significantly-cheaper Laptop II has already demonstrated true value in its “premium” segment bragging rights with *far* superior materials and build quality. If you’re looking for the prettiest possible slice of magnesium lightness but aren’t the sort to have followed the story of Microsoft’s first venture into personal computer production since it began in the last year of the Mayan calendar, it’s worth your while to read [Joshua Topolsky’s projections of the project’s impact on the popular narrative surrounding Microsoft](https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2012\/6\/19\/3097726\/surface-microsoft-next-chapter\/in\/2859835) from history’s freshest possible perspective: the eve of the first Surface tablet’s launch.\n\n> The entire tablet was designed in-house by Microsoft's teams, and if you believe what was said in the presentation yesterday, design and functionality in hardware has suddenly become a big deal in Redmond. That's a big shift, and it's an important one. The announcement of the Surface shows that Microsoft is ready to make a break with its history — a history of hardware partnerships which relied on companies like Dell, HP, or Acer to actually bring its products to market. That may burn partners in the short term, but it could also give Microsoft something it desperately needs: a clear story.\n\nA pungent stigma festered from Microsoft’s history of inadequate and inelegant public relations (especially compared to its greatest longtime rival) has remained in relentlessly obvious orbit around every “significant” Windows and Office update for so long that its status quo has grown into a truly inhibitive force for *all* parties involved. Topolsky is unquestionably a compromising favorite of mine, but it’s hard not to decry then-CEO Steve Ballmer’s failure to comprehend Josh’s day-after insight in the *whole three months* that passed before [his Seattle Times interview in September, 2012](http:\/\/old.seattletimes.com\/html\/businesstechnology\/2019168601_microsoftballmer16.html). Ultimately, The Big M is either **incapable** of understanding any alternative utopic Visions of Computing to its own, or simply **overwrought** with the same counteraspirational carelessness its culture has always depended upon. In analytical terms regarding Ballmer’s utilization of the forum’s opportunity to finally *tell the fucking story*, at least, the timidity of a term like “pre-eminent software” as a viably bright new beacon in contrast with “*people* would say we were a software company” (emphasis mine) – as if Steve-O himself doesn’t even have the power to publicly *describe his company’s function* as its #1 man – combined at the apex of what was almost impressively-negligent behavior.\n\n> I think when you look forward, our core capability will be software, (but) you'll probably think of us more as a devices-and-services company. Which is a little different. Software powers devices and software powers these cloud services, but it's a different form of delivery...\n\nDon’t make the same mistake I did and wear yourself out trying to extract the meaning from these three sentences – there’s none to be found. Ultimately, whatever opportunity the Surface project could have provided for Microsoft’s identity has been vastly overshadowed by its success as last resort supercatalyst to restore *any* sense of dignity and pride within the hardware companies who produce the vehicles. In Fall 2017, *The Register* [quoted industry gossip](https:\/\/www.theregister.co.uk\/2017\/10\/04\/surface\/) regarding the company’s new CEO Satya Nadella and his intent to “exit the product line” because “overall they are not making money [and] it doesn’t make sense for them to be in this business,” but newcomers to this conversation should know that no subsequent reporting has corroborated anything but a [sustaining future of the line](https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2018\/12\/5\/18125306\/microsoft-fluent-design-windows-office-surface-future), though the measurable rate of innovation in Microsoft’s products continues to leave much to be desired. Now that you’ve heard from the experts, though, allow me to expand our lens a bit and examine what the Surface Laptop 2’s existence suggests as per *The Present & Future of Computing*.\n\n## The Clam Clan\n\nIn case I’ve yet to mention it, all of my tech writing is in substantial debt to my much-older and child-oriented siblings for providing 8 nieces and nephews over the course of 11 years – if not for any reason but the perspective offered by the slightest observation of their day-to-day lives. In this profoundly bizarre and historic technological sprint our species is experiencing, the differences in their respective relationships with consumer tech as they’ve grown up are fascinatingly… disturbingly significant. My eldest niece Abby was born four years after myself in 1998, and her younger sister Amber just quite three years later in 2001. All three of us are Aquarians who went to the same public schools (aside from 2 exceptions on my part,) and the two sisters have been close, significant influences on each other all their lives, yet the way Abby and I use and think about computers differs significantly from Amber’s. Our first real PCs introduced an important social and intellectual vehicle to our pre-teen lives, and both of us still “live on” our machines as young adults. For us and many others from this short-lived microgeneration of ours, budget laptops like the Dell Inspirion 2200 (which served as the first “real computer” for both of us) introduced the internet and Being Online as a State of Being with AIM groups, MySpace, and Yahoo! chain mails before smartphones and tablets were capable of doing so.\n\nAmber prefers to use her iPhone for most everything and regards her computer as a tool for work – it’s booted up and down exclusively for that purpose, which is significantly healthier than the habit Abby, myself, and many of my Online friends developed: we left our computers running and Logged On all the time because we were otherwise unreachable. We learned from origin to depend on them for 100% of our computing tasks – from streaming Pandora to playing Flash games within six billion open browser tabs – which likely explains both our ADD and its resulting influence on the ease with which our personal computers can distract us. As a Journalism student and professional photographer, Abby uses the new 15-inch MacBook Pro, and [Insane Blogger] David Blue has spent years looking for an alternative, becoming [the first and only iPhone user to make extensive use of its Bluetooth keyboard support](http:\/\/bilge.world\/ios-10-review-speed\/) in the process, but both of us are entirely uninterested in the rest of the industry’s insistence on [convertibles](https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2018\/7\/2\/17515896\/dell-xps-2-in-1-convertible-laptop-review), [removable keyboards](https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2018\/10\/16\/17979504\/microsoft-surface-pro-6-review-tablet-features-price-windows-10-matte-black), or [‘professional’ tablets](https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2018\/11\/5\/18062612\/apple-ipad-pro-review-2018-screen-usb-c-pencil-price-features). I wish the Linux community was finally ready to drop the elitist pretenses plaguing its nerdy history; I wish I could finally tell someone like Abby that a machine like the [System76 Galago Pro](https:\/\/www.pcworld.com\/article\/3198671\/linux\/the-system76-galago-pro-is-a-fierce-featherweight-competitor.html) could slot itself into her workflow without losing her time or compatibility – that the reputation surrounding Linux People had finally lost most of its validity and her desire to learn more about computing as a young woman and Power User would be met with respectful and worthwhile conversation from their end. Unfortunately, I’ve still found some of the Old Guard to be elitist, socially behind, and juvenilely possessive, as if computing was still the niche interest from their 1980s and 90s childhoods. Though this conversation certainly warrants its own essay in the future, I’ll just express now that it’s a real shame some folks don’t realize the entire point of making great things is ultimately to **give them to the world**.\n\nThe opportunity I’ve had in the past year to finally get my Linux distro frenzy over with and out of my system managed to both radicalize and democratize my understanding of MacOS, Windows, and Linux as they are in the present. While I had nothing better to do, fiddling with Ubuntu Studio and Linux Mint to the extent I did throughout Spring and Summer led me to further appreciate [the value of keyboard shortcuts](https:\/\/mastodon.social\/@DavidBlue\/101073796864823479), gave me [my first real proficiency with a command line](https:\/\/mastodon.social\/@DavidBlue\/100917824456128537), helped [globalize my comprehension of my own technological privilege](http:\/\/bilge.world\/internet-connection-withdrawals-telegram-opera\/), reacquainted me in a huge way with both [the true history of software](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/vintagecomputing\/comments\/9hpqov\/lotussmartsuite_and_the_year_2000\/) and my own personal past as [an experimental test tube baby of Microsoft’s](https:\/\/mastodon.social\/@DavidBlue\/100771954295147256), and helped to answer a lot of questions I’d [worried over for years](http:\/\/www.extratone.com\/audio\/futureland\/sorghum\/) about why software seemed like it simply *couldn’t improve* anymore. While it’s true that important open source projects like [ElementaryOS](https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/jasonevangelho\/2018\/09\/10\/elementary-os-first-impressions-a-great-linux-doorway-for-macos-users\/#231f4faa4289) continue to sprout from the Linus Extended Universe and the [growing Open Source community on Mastodon](http:\/\/bit.ly\/dbmastodon) is filled with brilliant, helpful, unpretentious, and remarkably curious enthusiasts (probably because many of those I’ve interacted with so far are non-cis and\/or non-white,) little ole me was able to stumble upon some totally unnecessary and excruciatingly ignorant sociopolitical commentary by way of the white, middle-age host and his undoubtedly-white and staunchly libertarian caller on a live broadcast of the *Ask Noah Show*. (It’s not as if I haven’t said ignorant and very ugly things too, but I wasn’t a forty-something *father* on a semi-professional talk show representing an entire community.)\n\nEssentially, I was quite frustrated and disappointed to find that **Linux is still let down most by its own community**, but the operating system itself is still *much* further along on its way to becoming a real alternative for the average user than mainstream tech journalism would have you believe. However, in my case, finally taking the time to *really* learn about Open Source computing *also* helped me understand (surprisingly) why Apple and its environment continue to be the best and most popular choice for professional applications. Linux Mint gave me tremendous power in enabling me to alter, specify, and redesign the most minute details of its interface, but I couldn’t have foreseen how all-consuming such power would be for someone like myself. In retrospect, I’ve realized that I ended up spending more time perfecting my custom LibreOffice Writer shortcuts than I did *actually writing* – I somehow found myself in a mind state which justified unironically creating *a shortcut for the Shortcuts menu*. Though I swore I’d never succumb to the bewildering hobby of collecting and exploring different Linux Distributions, it took no time at all for me to fill a folder with disc images of the installers for almost a dozen different interpretations of the operating system after I’d made the simple concession to myself that *I’ll just try Ubuntu, that’s all*. The most profound realization from all this (arguably otherwise wasted) time: **for a user like me, a walled garden is actually the best place to be productive** because *apparently*, I don’t have the self-control to keep myself from *running away* and\/or fixating on completely unproductive tasks without its boundaries. I think this phenomenon is perhaps the worst culprit in the persistence of the aforementioned divide between “computer people” and everyone else who simply *uses* computers, as I’m sure any one of the latter could tell you after all of five minutes with a Linus type.\n\nThe most comprehensive and somewhat-urgent revision to illustrate the significance of this contrast from my perspective regards the exceptional iOS\/MacOS markdown-based notetaking app Bear. Frankly, my own “[Word Processing Methodology](http:\/\/www.extratone.com\/words\/processing\/)” essay from June has already become problematically out of date (and therefore embarrassing) in terms of my own knowledge of the segment and its history. Though I promised the conversation was “done,” I’ve continued to explore further into word processing’s history as well as its current state. “I had a go at Bear’s free iOS experience and saw little functional difference from DayOne,” the old, negligent, cursory David Blue noted, but if I’d simply been willing to cough up a bit more time and just $1.49 a month for [Bear Pro](https:\/\/bear.app\/#pricing), I’d have spared myself such shame and realized that the hype around this app really is 100% justified. **Bear is the most beautiful iOS app I’ve ever seen**, but I’m now also fully qualified to declare it the most effective execution of “distraction-free” writing software to come along in the past 25 years. Developer Shiny Frog’s secret is their perfect balance between capability and simplicity. It turns out, [Daily Content Lord Casey Newton’s word on this matter](https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2017\/3\/2\/14785264\/evernote-replacement-bear-app) *really was* worth more than mine, not to mention more succinct: “Bear may look simple, but there’s power underneath the surface.”\n\nThose longtime Linux and Windows diehards who’ve tolerated me thus far, listen up: MacOS may be ancient, neglected, and full of incongruencies, but its single-minded methodology paired with Apple’s iCloud *really does* make it the most effective and elegant environment for most people to simply *get shit done*. It’s clear that many of you have realized the importance of simplicity for compact and\/or educational distributions, but let me just add that **the democratization of Linux provides a gargantuan development opportunity to make something that beats MacOS at its own game** without starting from such a shitty premise and all of its resulting compromises – all without detracting from any other technically-minded distributions whatsoever. *That* is the magic of *The Distro*, remember?! If you’ve existed in a similar state of confusion to that of my entire adult life regarding the appeal of Apple products – despite having once been an extensive OSX user, myself – *you’re very welcome* for the insight. Instead of paying me for the profound self-improvement I’ve just provided, try prioritizing this newfound knowledge the next time you talk to your MacBook Pro-loving friend about their workflow. If you’re like myself, you’ll find their arguments have magically transformed from the bewildering bullshit they’ve always seemed to be into challenges for future competing operating systems to surpass Apple’s old bitch and excel in because MacOS and [even its much-younger iOS counterpart](http:\/\/bilge.world\/ios-12-review-siri-shortcuts\/) – as well as the billions of people who depend on them – *desperately* need real competition in order to maintain their viability, much less become what products of the world’s wealthiest company *should* be.\n\nYes, the manner in which these operating systems are perceived really *is* an important discussion prompted by a product as insignificant as the Surface Laptop 2 because as you read, the industry is bracing for another *paradigm shift* in computing, which many believe (preposterously, I might add) could be as significant and disruptive as 2007’s introduction of the iPhone. This machine of Microsoft’s and its “new” MacBook Air counterpart could potentially be the last designs to carry us to a computing future where the tried-and-true clamshell design is forgone entirely by the mainstream, but [Apple’s release of this year’s new iPad Pro](https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/technology\/2018\/oct\/30\/apple-new-ipad-pro-launched-all-screen-design-face-id-usb-c-processor-magnetic-keyboard) prompted even [the most Cupertino-loving](https:\/\/supercomputer.transistor.fm\/13) tech commentators to respond with *genuine discord* along with a few long-overdue shouts of “*are you crazy*?!” I’m very proud of *The Verge*’s [Nilay Patel](http:\/\/twitter.com\/reckless), in particular, for so eloquently deconstructing its usability for all but the very wealthy. “It is impossible to look at a device this powerful and expensive and not expect it to replace a laptop for day-to-day work,” he reminds us in the introduction to [his full review of the updated product](https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2018\/11\/5\/18062612\/apple-ipad-pro-review-2018-screen-usb-c-pencil-price-features), along with a beautifully transient sentiment which I think we all needed to hear again: “I don’t think people should adapt to their computers. Computers should adapt to people.” Even something as consumerist and bourgeois as the introduction of another pricepoint-burgeoning Apple hardware flagship can turn a simple tablet review into a much-needed manifesto for a user-centric way forward for the industry, which is itself worthy of celebratory encouragement.\n\nI’ve favored *The Verge* and its cast long past the point of excess [throughout the span](http:\/\/bilge.world\/?s=verge) of my work about technology, but Nilay’s review and its [accompanying episode of *The Vergecast*](https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2018\/11\/8\/18075992\/vergecast-podcast-330-ipad-pro-macbook-air-review) are *truly* special and profound gems of content that shouldn’t be passed up. Apparently – as the Editor-in-Chief immediately insists as the episode begins – his “ongoing theory” that “the more important you are, the less actually important work you do, and the more likely you are to be an iPad user” roused anger from “that whole class of [billionaires,]” but the experiences behind his argument actually suggest that Apple’s own favorite child of late – into which it has begun investing and thereby implicitly *sponsoring* over its much older brother as the ultimate heir of the majority’s future computing – has unequivocally **failed** to do its part in growing the iPad Pro into the “laptop replacement” we’d all heard so much about. Of iOS 12’s performance as an operating system beneath true work-related tasks, he exasperates “you have to spend all of your time figuring out how to do stuff instead of doing stuff,” which I couldn’t help but hear as echoes of my own late Linux lamentations. As thankful as I am to have finally achieved enlightenment of the Planet Apple, I’m afraid I was pitifully late: its very natural laws underwent their most brutal tests of the 21st century this past year. Now that I’ve finally come to adore the elegant effectiveness of a new generation of iOS apps like Bear, I’m faced with yet another of the episode’s statements of weight: “I think it’s time to stop pretending that the future of computing looks like Apple’s restrictions.” On the opposing end of the line, the world’s first trillion-dollar company’s *other* major product release of 2018 [managed to disappoint](https:\/\/www.engadget.com\/2018\/11\/09\/apple-macbook-air-review-2018\/) even the most fanatical fans of its original operating system’s best-selling platform with [an insultingly mediocre update to the MacBook Air](https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2018\/11\/6\/18064552\/macbook-air-2018-review-retina-keyboard-apple-features-battery-price) marque upon which it [once so fondly doted](https:\/\/www.engadget.com\/2008\/01\/25\/macbook-air-review\/).\n\nMy best friend’s parents bought her [the original Surface tablet](https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2012\/10\/23\/3540550\/microsoft-surface-review) when she enrolled in art school, and her frustration with its lackluster keyboard (among others) leads MacOS alternative-seeking users like us to wish Microsoft had started with a traditional design like the Surface Laptop first. Perhaps Apple and Microsoft’s emphasis on their tablets is nothing but a bit premature for the *most* current crop of users, and the rest of my nieces and nephews will expand upon an entirely different methodology of usership when they receive their freshman computer. Those elders of us who still take the Clamshell form seriously and love printing our documents are apparently facing a future industry saturated with products we can’t believe in, but it’s up to you to decide if this issue is worth expending your energy in advocacy for either camp. With my 120+ word per minute proficiency with physical keyboards, *I* for one have been completely bewildered by the iPad as anything but an indulgence for reading text on the web, and I’m pleased as punch with my Surface Laptop 2. Even if it proves to be the last new computer I’ll ever own to come as optimized for my use, I’m just grateful and astonished it happens to be the best yet.\n\n#hardware #microsoft #future","views":2057,"updated":"2019-05-27T13:33:11Z","tags":["microsoft","future","hardware"],"type":null,"title":"Microsoft's Surface Laptop 2 Was Built for Me but You Should Buy One Too","slug":"microsoft-surface-laptop-2-review-windows-future","appearance":"norm","language":"en","rtl":false,"created":"2018-12-25T05:00:00Z","images":["https:\/\/i.snap.as\/Py8bIP7.jpg"],"collection":{"public":false,"alias":"extratone","total_posts":0,"title":"Extratone","verification_link":"","description":"For the New Curious.","style_sheet":"","views":182661,"monetization_pointer":""},"paid":false},{"id":"dvim67m6d585202l","body":"![Microsoft Surface Laptop 2](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/r6NbXgI.jpg)\n\n## Another accidental hardware acquisition astoundingly ended up becoming my favorite of any portable computer I've ever owned.  \n\n<!--more-->\n\n<audio controls>\n  <source src=\"https:\/\/davidblue.wtf\/audio\/SurfaceLaptop2.m4a\">\n<\/audio>\n\nAssuming Jesus Christ is in your thoughts this evening before yet another anniversary of his birth, I am infinitely astonished by the truth in what I’m about to suppose with you. If the Son of God was living today, most of us have agreed for a long time now that he’d use marijuana recreationally - big fuckin whoop. I think it’s far more interesting and appropriate (we all know his birthday was [wholly reconfigured into a consumerist holiday](https:\/\/www.thisamericanlife.org\/47\/christmas-and-commerce) long ago) to speculate on how he’d behave after finding himself inadvertently in the market for a new laptop within the ~$1000 range (following a *stubbed toe whilst walking on water* incident, perhaps.) Surely, it would not be entirely holy for him to opt in to the Foxconn-complicit world of Apple, Incorporated, nor the [openly-blasphemous](https:\/\/bilge.world\/google-soul-ledger-dont-be-evil) one created and exuberantly grown by Google LLC, and I’m afraid he’d be too much of an *End User* idiot to integrate any of the sparse Linux-dedicated hardware available. In May of 2017, however, Billy Gates’ old Microsoft finally released “[the laptop we’ve always wanted them to make](https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2017\/5\/5\/15557738\/vergecast-podcast-255-microsoft-surface-laptop-samsung-dex-i-clicked-the-doc),” but could its recent update be truly worthy of our Lourde and Saviour? Or your newly-enrolled offspring? Should you sprint downstairs and swap out the new MacBook Air you just bought?\n\n<iframe src=\"https:\/\/www.listennotes.com\/podcasts\/end-user\/microsoft-designed-its-new-AY29WFlPczw\/embed\/\" height=\"170px\" width=\"100%\" style=\"width: 1px; min-width: 100%;\" loading=\"lazy\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe>\n\nFrom an entirely valid perspective, an observer might declare my last two months of 2018 to be an outright shameful period defined by hypocrisy and traitorous betrayals. After finally taking the time to explore the full narrative surrounding Linux and the bloody tale of Microsoft’s cruel genocidal destruction of countless creative software projects throughout computing’s adolescence (see: “[Embrace, Extend, Extinguish](https:\/\/youtu.be\/TVHcdgrqbHE?t=425),”) I eventually declared myself “100% Open Source” and began outlining an essay designed primarily to express that *Linux is finally ready to be the operating system of the people* without succumbing immediately to the brand of cybercrackpot illegitimacy associated with the L-word in the minds of the general public so readily thanks to decades of misinformed, condescending neckbeards. Such a feat would require entire new planes of cultural awareness and dialectal delicacy, yet certainly result in zero personal reward from even the best possible outcome, yet I proceeded to ponder the subject very deliberately all the way through October because I genuinely believed in a new democratized future of computing. 2018 had been my Grand Awakening to the idyllic possibilities of Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) across the whole applied spectrum from office suites to [social networks](http:\/\/bilge.world\/federated\/), yet - as two thousand eighteen comes to an end - I’ve managed to find myself among the most [jaded, soul-sapped](https:\/\/youtu.be\/O0RSeFcv3Qs) tech community I have yet encountered: **Microsoft Administrators**.\n\nComplimenting this Linux-laden culture in which I was not so long ago deeply embedded was a confused and frustrated outlook regarding what I felt were excessive and completely idiotic sacrifices across the industry’s hardware design to the greedy, gluttonous god of Lightness. It seemed only reasonable to Myself As Consumer that the entire buying public should exclusively seek designs prioritizing greatest possible performance and battery life, even from portable computers and smartphones, so I assumed my perspective on this updated iteration of Microsoft's most laptopy Surface laptop - which exists in large part to [compete directly with](https:\/\/www.pcmag.com\/news\/364728\/spec-down-apple-macbook-air-vs-microsoft-surface-laptop-2) Apple's beloved (and just-updated) MacBook Air - wouldn't be at all useful. However, a few weeks ago, my employer prompted me with a sweet sweet ultimatum: *for the sake of a tax break, I want to spend ~$1000 on a laptop for you as soon as possible*. Yes, I know I should consider myself a very fortunate man - this [wasn't even the first time](https:\/\/bilge.world\/hp-spectre-x360-review) I'd been surprised with the \"hey, I want to buy you a laptop but it has to be today\" experience, and may even be considered a sort of sequel to my *Tales of Whirlwind Manic Consumerism*, but it’s ultimately one of the most idiotic strategies to achieve a major purchase decision and completely inadvisable for anyone on a budget. Still I was indeed thankful to be put in a nearly-identical situation of Consumer Electronic haste, and have come to be especially appreciative of the specific time I was approached as such: just one week after [Microsoft launched the Surface Laptop 2](https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2018\/10\/16\/17979516\/microsoft-surface-laptop-2-review-specs-price-features-windows-10).\n\nConsidering the vast majority of its users are [trapped inside my television](https:\/\/theoutline.com\/post\/2923\/the-popularity-of-microsoft-surface-is-the-least-realistic-thing-on-television), there’s no harm in covering the Surface brand with our virtual palm for a moment. If you’ll indulge me so, you’ll notice that Microsoft has actually delivered unto us **The Laptop II** - as in, the sequel... the *successor* to *every other laptop computer* yet conceived... but does this one machine truly represent the second coming of the *Notebook Christ*? Naturally, it would be a bit zealous to stand behind this extreme statement with 100% sincerity, but there truly *are* certain elements of this Personal Computing product's execution which do indeed will its user to expect and\/or desire from others in coming years. As I've stated before, I also simply cannot help but be jazzed by such bravado from the mouths of even a company with as crooked and hateful history as Microsoft's. (Note: no other technology company has actually achieved what Microsoft historically has in this regard, and hopefully none ever will again.)\n\nI must be honest: it hasn't yet been two months and I've already scuffed and perhaps even *stained* the beautiful maroon alcantara surrounding my machine’s touchable body, but it’s occurred to me that I might draw upon the vast library of [automotive interior tutorials](https:\/\/youtu.be\/PM-FbFIBoCs) available on YouTube - and even purchase some of the alcantara care-specific products they recommend - in order to *really* maintain the exterior of the Laptop II. After all, [alcantara was undeniably car culture’s material first](https:\/\/www.popularmechanics.com\/cars\/a9653\/what-is-alcantara\/). I should also confess that objectively, the Surface Laptop II is the best-suited computer for *my personal uses* that I’ve ever owned *or* used for any length of time. Subjectively, I don’t think all of the hardware design touches that make it so - like its keyboard layout, divine 3:2 aspect ratio, and particular I\/O complement - have yet had the chance to seduce my emotional brain into truly *loving* it as much as I certainly should by any reasonable measure. For my own sake, I hope I’m able to fall in child-like infatuation with its magic, but in the interim, I believe the coldness of my heart should hopefully preserve any useful commentary I might have to add. Though this is undoubtedly the most timely review of a hardware product I’ve ever published, I’d still ask that you indulge my perspective suggesting the importance of considering it part of a *package* with its operating system, considering that the whole of tech media would’ve unanimously declared it the year’s “[best laptop](https:\/\/mashable.com\/review\/microsoft-surface-laptop-2\/)” were Apple’s aging, but still widely-adored MacOS absent from the frame.\n\n> I've tested a bunch of laptops this year, running the spectrum of 2-in-1s, Chromebooks, MacBooks, gaming laptops, etc. Everyone's needs are going to be different, which is why there's no such thing as a one-size-fits-all for laptops. But enthusiasts’ laptops aside, I strongly feel the Surface Laptop 2 is the best laptop of the year. And by that I mean the best laptop for most folks' needs.\n\nWith as much humility as possible, I must add that I myself am *anything* but “most folks,” yet my experience so far with the product has been one of astonishing compatibility and battery life. Using recommended power settings, the Surface Laptop 2 endured [**four hours and twenty-two minutes**](https:\/\/twitter.com\/NeoYokel\/status\/1080514545062477825) of a workload it wasn’t particularly designed for including heavy web browsing, image manipulation, brief audio\/video capture with OBS, and moderate subsequent editing in Audacity and OpenShot. Dan Seifert - Vox Media’s “[only Windows user](https:\/\/www.recode.net\/2017\/5\/12\/15628228\/microsoft-surface-laptop-apple-macbook-air-windows-10s-dan-seifert-recode-podcast)” - reported “about seven hours” of Microsoft’s claimed 14.5, but frankly, I don’t know what any of y’all are doin - I’m just thankful this machine is a better marathoner than any other I can recall owning. While we’re on the subject, I consider Microsoft’s inclusion of a magnetically-attached power cable and unassuming auxiliary USB charging port on the attached power supply to be personal godsends - further evidence, even, that the Surface Laptop 2 was *actually designed to be nice to use*. For the sake of those readers **actually in the market for a new laptop** who’ve somehow found themselves here, though, Raymond Wong’s review for *Mashable* is the most thorough offering you’ll find - it’s quoted front and center on [Microsoft’s web page for the Laptop II](https:\/\/www.microsoft.com\/en-us\/p\/surface-laptop-2\/8XQJKK3DD91B), even - but it’s important to mention that his critical comparative perspective predates the late launch of its ultimate competitor, [the new MacBook Air](https:\/\/mashable.com\/review\/apple-macbook-air\/). Rather pitifully, however, his colleague’s “good, but not great” resolution suggests that Apple failed to challenge Microsoft’s relatively moderate update enough to warrant any revision, and that *Mashable* as a publication stands by my new laptop’s *Best of the Year* title, for whatever it may or may not be worth to you. \n\n> If the new [MacBook Air](https:\/\/zdcs.link\/zjWl1?pageview=06Fe2GZo26XvMYZgLndTadT) came in at the same price as the old one, it would be a steal. Sure, you pay for the privilege of being able to use macOS on the Apple ecosystem. But in years past that also meant access to cutting-edge features and design. As pretty as the MacBook Air is, there's nothing that innovative about it. In today's Apple, it seems, privilege amounts to just staying current.\n\nYou won’t find many others who regularly invest editorial merit in publishing 2500+ word laptop reviews anymore, which I’d concede is plenty reasonable in the Surface Laptop’s case, at least. Perhaps your first point of comparative entry should be [a barely-dated conversation](https:\/\/www.recode.net\/2017\/5\/12\/15628228\/microsoft-surface-laptop-apple-macbook-air-windows-10s-dan-seifert-recode-podcast) between Kara Swisher, Lauren Goode, and Dan Seifert on *Too Embarrassed to Ask* regarding the original’s odds of truly competing in the “premium laptop” segment (if you’d prefer to hear from those who struggle to take it seriously, that is.) Assuming [the original product direction of the Surface line](https:\/\/www.zdnet.com\/article\/what-oems-desperately-need-to-learn-from-microsofts-surface\/) still stands, Microsoft doesn’t actually intend to sell at high volume, especially when it comes to this runt of the marque, which does not hesitate to omit itself from the popular discourse of the moment surrounding tablets as the future of all computing to which all of its siblings have [contributed so much](https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2014\/5\/23\/5743416\/microsoft-surface-pro-3-review). Though I shall always remember my dearest Libel (the special edition Spectre x360 with which I built most of *Extratone*) with great respect and deep fondness - I think it’s even worth mounting on some sort of plinth - the significantly-cheaper Laptop II has already demonstrated true value in its “premium” segment bragging rights with *far* superior materials and build quality. If you’re looking for the prettiest possible slice of magnesium lightness but aren’t the sort to have followed the story of Microsoft’s first venture into personal computer production since it began in the last year of the Mayan calendar, it’s worth your while to read [Joshua Topolsky’s projections of the project’s impact on the popular narrative surrounding Microsoft](https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2012\/6\/19\/3097726\/surface-microsoft-next-chapter\/in\/2859835) from history’s freshest possible perspective: the eve of the first Surface tablet’s launch.\n\n> The entire tablet was designed in-house by Microsoft's teams, and if you believe what was said in the presentation yesterday, design and functionality in hardware has suddenly become a big deal in Redmond. That's a big shift, and it's an important one. The announcement of the Surface shows that Microsoft is ready to make a break with its history — a history of hardware partnerships which relied on companies like Dell, HP, or Acer to actually bring its products to market. That may burn partners in the short term, but it could also give Microsoft something it desperately needs: a clear story.\n\nA pungent stigma festered from Microsoft’s history of inadequate and inelegant public relations (especially compared to its greatest longtime rival) has remained in relentlessly obvious orbit around every “significant” Windows and Office update for so long that its status quo has grown into a truly inhibitive force for *all* parties involved. Topolsky is unquestionably a compromising favorite of mine, but it’s hard not to decry then-CEO Steve Ballmer’s failure to comprehend Josh’s day-after insight in the *whole three months* that passed before [his Seattle Times interview in September, 2012](http:\/\/old.seattletimes.com\/html\/businesstechnology\/2019168601_microsoftballmer16.html). Ultimately, The Big M is either **incapable** of understanding any alternative utopic Visions of Computing to its own, or simply **overwrought** with the same counteraspirational carelessness its culture has always depended upon. In analytical terms regarding Ballmer’s utilization of the forum’s opportunity to finally *tell the fucking story*, at least, the timidity of a term like “pre-eminent software” as a viably bright new beacon in contrast with “*people* would say we were a software company” (emphasis mine) - as if Steve-O himself doesn’t even have the power to publicly *describe his company’s function* as its #1 man - combined at the apex of what was almost impressively-negligent behavior.\n\n> I think when you look forward, our core capability will be software, (but) you'll probably think of us more as a devices-and-services company. Which is a little different. Software powers devices and software powers these cloud services, but it's a different form of delivery...\n\nDon’t make the same mistake I did and wear yourself out trying to extract the meaning from these three sentences - there’s none to be found. Ultimately, whatever opportunity the Surface project could have provided for Microsoft’s identity has been vastly overshadowed by its success as last resort supercatalyst to restore *any* sense of dignity and pride within the hardware companies who produce the vehicles. In Fall 2017, *The Register* [quoted industry gossip](https:\/\/www.theregister.co.uk\/2017\/10\/04\/surface\/) regarding the company’s new CEO Satya Nadella and his intent to “exit the product line” because “overall they are not making money [and] it doesn’t make sense for them to be in this business,” but newcomers to this conversation should know that no subsequent reporting has corroborated anything but a [sustaining future of the line](https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2018\/12\/5\/18125306\/microsoft-fluent-design-windows-office-surface-future), though the measurable rate of innovation in Microsoft’s products continues to leave much to be desired. Now that you’ve heard from the experts, though, allow me to expand our lens a bit and examine what the Surface Laptop 2’s existence suggests as per *The Present & Future of Computing*.\n\n## The Clam Clan\n\nIn case I’ve yet to mention it, all of my tech writing is in substantial debt to my much-older and child-oriented siblings for providing 8 nieces and nephews over the course of 11 years - if not for any reason but the perspective offered by the slightest observation of their day-to-day lives. In this profoundly bizarre and historic technological sprint our species is experiencing, the differences in their respective relationships with consumer tech as they’ve grown up are fascinatingly… disturbingly significant. My eldest niece Abby was born four years after myself in 1998, and her younger sister Amber just quite three years later in 2001. All three of us are Aquarians who went to the same public schools (aside from 2 exceptions on my part,) and the two sisters have been close, significant influences on each other all their lives, yet the way Abby and I use and think about computers differs significantly from Amber’s. Our first real PCs introduced an important social and intellectual vehicle to our pre-teen lives, and both of us still “live on” our machines as young adults. For us and many others from this short-lived microgeneration of ours, budget laptops like the Dell Inspirion 2200 (which served as the first “real computer” for both of us) introduced the internet and Being Online as a State of Being with AIM groups, MySpace, and Yahoo! chain mails before smartphones and tablets were capable of doing so.\n\nAmber prefers to use her iPhone for most everything and regards her computer as a tool for work - it’s booted up and down exclusively for that purpose, which is significantly healthier than the habit Abby, myself, and many of my Online friends developed: we left our computers running and Logged On all the time because we were otherwise unreachable. We learned from origin to depend on them for 100% of our computing tasks - from streaming Pandora to playing Flash games within six billion open browser tabs - which likely explains both our ADD and its resulting influence on the ease with which our personal computers can distract us. As a Journalism student and professional photographer, Abby uses the new 15-inch MacBook Pro, and [Insane Blogger] David Blue has spent years looking for an alternative, becoming [the first and only iPhone user to make extensive use of its Bluetooth keyboard support](http:\/\/bilge.world\/ios-10-review-speed\/) in the process, but both of us are entirely uninterested in the rest of the industry’s insistence on [convertibles](https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2018\/7\/2\/17515896\/dell-xps-2-in-1-convertible-laptop-review), [removable keyboards](https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2018\/10\/16\/17979504\/microsoft-surface-pro-6-review-tablet-features-price-windows-10-matte-black), or [‘professional’ tablets](https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2018\/11\/5\/18062612\/apple-ipad-pro-review-2018-screen-usb-c-pencil-price-features). I wish the Linux community was finally ready to drop the elitist pretenses plaguing its nerdy history; I wish I could finally tell someone like Abby that a machine like the [System76 Galago Pro](https:\/\/www.pcworld.com\/article\/3198671\/linux\/the-system76-galago-pro-is-a-fierce-featherweight-competitor.html) could slot itself into her workflow without losing her time or compatibility - that the reputation surrounding Linux People had finally lost most of its validity and her desire to learn more about computing as a young woman and Power User would be met with respectful and worthwhile conversation from their end. Unfortunately, I’ve still found some of the Old Guard to be elitist, socially behind, and juvenilely possessive, as if computing was still the niche interest from their 1980s and 90s childhoods. Though this conversation certainly warrants its own essay in the future, I’ll just express now that it’s a real shame some folks don’t realize the entire point of making great things is ultimately to **give them to the world**.\n\nThe opportunity I’ve had in the past year to finally get my Linux distro frenzy over with and out of my system managed to both radicalize and democratize my understanding of MacOS, Windows, and Linux as they are in the present. While I had nothing better to do, fiddling with Ubuntu Studio and Linux Mint to the extent I did throughout Spring and Summer led me to further appreciate [the value of keyboard shortcuts](https:\/\/mastodon.social\/@DavidBlue\/101073796864823479), gave me [my first real proficiency with a command line](https:\/\/mastodon.social\/@DavidBlue\/100917824456128537), helped [globalize my comprehension of my own technological privilege](https:\/\/anchor.fm\/davidblue\/episodes\/Revelations-of-Network-Withdrawals-e2d7aq\/a-a235vs3), reacquainted me in a huge way with both [the true history of software](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/vintagecomputing\/comments\/9hpqov\/lotussmartsuite_and_the_year_2000\/) and my own personal past as [an experimental test tube baby of Microsoft’s](https:\/\/mastodon.social\/@DavidBlue\/100771954295147256), and helped to answer a lot of questions I’d worried over for years about why software seemed like it simply *couldn’t improve* anymore. While it’s true that important open source projects like [ElementaryOS](https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/jasonevangelho\/2018\/09\/10\/elementary-os-first-impressions-a-great-linux-doorway-for-macos-users\/#231f4faa4289) continue to sprout from the Linus Extended Universe and the [growing Open Source community on Mastodon](http:\/\/bit.ly\/dbmastodon) is filled with brilliant, helpful, unpretentious, and remarkably curious enthusiasts (probably because many of those I’ve interacted with so far are non-cis and\/or non-white,) little ole me was able to stumble upon some totally unnecessary and excruciatingly ignorant sociopolitical commentary by way of the white, middle-age host and his undoubtedly-white and staunchly libertarian caller on a live broadcast of the *Ask Noah Show*. (It’s not as if I haven’t said ignorant and very ugly things too, but I wasn’t a forty-something *father* on a semi-professional talk show representing an entire community.)\n\nEssentially, I was quite frustrated and disappointed to find that **Linux is still let down most by its own community**, but the operating system itself is still *much* further along on its way to becoming a real alternative for the average user than mainstream tech journalism would have you believe. However, in my case, finally taking the time to *really* learn about Open Source computing *also* helped me understand (surprisingly) why Apple and its environment continue to be the best and most popular choice for professional applications. Linux Mint gave me tremendous power in enabling me to alter, specify, and redesign the most minute details of its interface, but I couldn’t have foreseen how all-consuming such power would be for someone like myself. In retrospect, I’ve realized that I ended up spending more time perfecting my custom LibreOffice Writer shortcuts than I did *actually writing* - I somehow found myself in a mind state which justified unironically creating *a shortcut for the Shortcuts menu*. Though I swore I’d never succumb to the bewildering hobby of collecting and exploring different Linux Distributions, it took no time at all for me to fill a folder with disc images of the installers for almost a dozen different interpretations of the operating system after I’d made the simple concession to myself that *I’ll just try Ubuntu, that’s all*. The most profound realization from all this (arguably otherwise wasted) time: **for a user like me, a walled garden is actually the best place to be productive** because *apparently*, I don’t have the self-control to keep myself from *running away* and\/or fixating on completely unproductive tasks without its boundaries. I think this phenomenon is perhaps the worst culprit in the persistence of the aforementioned divide between “computer people” and everyone else who simply *uses* computers, as I’m sure any one of the latter could tell you after all of five minutes with a Linus type.\n\nThe most comprehensive and somewhat-urgent revision to illustrate the significance of this contrast from my perspective regards the exceptional iOS\/MacOS markdown-based notetaking app Bear. Frankly, my own “[Word Processing Methodology](https:\/\/bilge.world\/evernote-dropbox-paper-word-processing-history)” essay from June has already become problematically out of date (and therefore embarrassing) in terms of my own knowledge of the segment and its history. Though I promised the conversation was “done,” I’ve continued to explore further into word processing’s history as well as its current state. “I had a go at Bear’s free iOS experience and saw little functional difference from DayOne,” the old, negligent, cursory David Blue noted, but if I’d simply been willing to cough up a bit more time and just $1.49 a month for [Bear Pro](https:\/\/bear.app\/#pricing), I’d have spared myself such shame and realized that the hype around this app really is 100% justified. **Bear is the most beautiful iOS app I’ve ever seen**, but I’m now also fully qualified to declare it the most effective execution of “distraction-free” writing software to come along in the past 25 years. Developer Shiny Frog’s secret is their perfect balance between capability and simplicity. It turns out, [Daily Content Lord Casey Newton’s word on this matter](https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2017\/3\/2\/14785264\/evernote-replacement-bear-app) *really was* worth more than mine, not to mention more succinct: “Bear may look simple, but there’s power underneath the surface.”\n\nThose longtime Linux and Windows diehards who’ve tolerated me thus far, listen up: MacOS may be ancient, neglected, and full of incongruencies, but its single-minded methodology paired with Apple’s iCloud *really does* make it the most effective and elegant environment for most people to simply *get shit done*. It’s clear that many of you have realized the importance of simplicity for compact and\/or educational distributions, but let me just add that **the democratization of Linux provides a gargantuan development opportunity to make something that beats MacOS at its own game** without starting from such a shitty premise and all of its resulting compromises - all without detracting from any other technically-minded distributions whatsoever. *That* is the magic of *The Distro*, remember?! If you’ve existed in a similar state of confusion to that of my entire adult life regarding the appeal of Apple products - despite having once been an extensive OSX user, myself - *you’re very welcome* for the insight. Instead of paying me for the profound self-improvement I’ve just provided, try prioritizing this newfound knowledge the next time you talk to your MacBook Pro-loving friend about their workflow. If you’re like myself, you’ll find their arguments have magically transformed from the bewildering bullshit they’ve always seemed to be into challenges for future competing operating systems to surpass Apple’s old bitch and excel in because MacOS and [even its much-younger iOS counterpart](https:\/\/bilge.world\/siri-shortcuts-ios12-review) - as well as the billions of people who depend on them - *desperately* need real competition in order to maintain their viability, much less become what products of the world’s wealthiest company *should* be.\n\nYes, the manner in which these operating systems are perceived really *is* an important discussion prompted by a product as insignificant as the Surface Laptop 2 because as you read, the industry is bracing for another *paradigm shift* in computing, which many believe (preposterously, I might add) could be as significant and disruptive as 2007’s introduction of the iPhone. This machine of Microsoft’s and its “new” MacBook Air counterpart could potentially be the last designs to carry us to a computing future where the tried-and-true clamshell design is forgone entirely by the mainstream, but [Apple’s release of this year’s new iPad Pro](https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/technology\/2018\/oct\/30\/apple-new-ipad-pro-launched-all-screen-design-face-id-usb-c-processor-magnetic-keyboard) prompted even [the most Cupertino-loving](https:\/\/supercomputer.transistor.fm\/13) tech commentators to respond with *genuine discord* along with a few long-overdue shouts of “*are you crazy*?!” I’m very proud of *The Verge*’s [Nilay Patel](http:\/\/twitter.com\/reckless), in particular, for so eloquently deconstructing its usability for all but the very wealthy. “It is impossible to look at a device this powerful and expensive and not expect it to replace a laptop for day-to-day work,” he reminds us in the introduction to [his full review of the updated product](https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2018\/11\/5\/18062612\/apple-ipad-pro-review-2018-screen-usb-c-pencil-price-features), along with a beautifully transient sentiment which I think we all needed to hear again: “I don’t think people should adapt to their computers. Computers should adapt to people.” Even something as consumerist and bourgeois as the introduction of another pricepoint-burgeoning Apple hardware flagship can turn a simple tablet review into a much-needed manifesto for a user-centric way forward for the industry, which is itself worthy of celebratory encouragement.\n\nI’ve favored *The Verge* and its cast long past the point of excess throughout the span of my work about technology, but Nilay’s review and its [accompanying episode of *The Vergecast*](https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2018\/11\/8\/18075992\/vergecast-podcast-330-ipad-pro-macbook-air-review) are *truly* special and profound gems of content that shouldn’t be passed up. Apparently - as the Editor-in-Chief immediately insists as the episode begins - his “ongoing theory” that “the more important you are, the less actually important work you do, and the more likely you are to be an iPad user” roused anger from “that whole class of [billionaires,]” but the experiences behind his argument actually suggest that Apple’s own favorite child of late - into which it has begun investing and thereby implicitly *sponsoring* over its much older brother as the ultimate heir of the majority’s future computing - has unequivocally **failed** to do its part in growing the iPad Pro into the “laptop replacement” we’d all heard so much about. Of iOS 12’s performance as an operating system beneath true work-related tasks, he exasperates “you have to spend all of your time figuring out how to do stuff instead of doing stuff,” which I couldn’t help but hear as echoes of my own late Linux lamentations. As thankful as I am to have finally achieved enlightenment of the Planet Apple, I’m afraid I was pitifully late: its very natural laws underwent their most brutal tests of the 21st century this past year. Now that I’ve finally come to adore the elegant effectiveness of a new generation of iOS apps like Bear, I’m faced with yet another of the episode’s statements of weight: “I think it’s time to stop pretending that the future of computing looks like Apple’s restrictions.” On the opposing end of the line, the world’s first trillion-dollar company’s *other* major product release of 2018 [managed to disappoint](https:\/\/www.engadget.com\/2018\/11\/09\/apple-macbook-air-review-2018\/) even the most fanatical fans of its original operating system’s best-selling platform with [an insultingly mediocre update to the MacBook Air](https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2018\/11\/6\/18064552\/macbook-air-2018-review-retina-keyboard-apple-features-battery-price) marque upon which it [once so fondly doted](https:\/\/www.engadget.com\/2008\/01\/25\/macbook-air-review\/).\n\nMy best friend’s parents bought her [the original Surface tablet](https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2012\/10\/23\/3540550\/microsoft-surface-review) when she enrolled in art school, and her frustration with its lackluster keyboard (among others) leads MacOS alternative-seeking users like us to wish Microsoft had started with a traditional design like the Surface Laptop first. Perhaps Apple and Microsoft’s emphasis on their tablets is nothing but a bit premature for the *most* current crop of users, and the rest of my nieces and nephews will expand upon an entirely different methodology of usership when they receive their freshman computer. Those elders of us who still take the Clamshell form seriously and love printing our documents are apparently facing a future industry saturated with products we can’t believe in, but it’s up to you to decide if this issue is worth expending your energy in advocacy for either camp. With my 120+ word per minute proficiency with physical keyboards, *I* for one have been completely bewildered by the iPad as anything but an indulgence for reading text on the web, and I’m pleased as punch with my Surface Laptop 2. Even if it proves to be the last new computer I’ll ever own to come as optimized for my use, I’m just grateful and astonished it happens to be the best yet.\n\n<!--comment-->\n\n#hardware","views":655,"updated":"2022-09-08T23:22:33Z","tags":["hardware"],"type":null,"title":"Microsoft's Surface Laptop 2 Was Built for Me but You Should Buy One Too","slug":"microsoft-surface-laptop-2-review","appearance":"norm","language":"en","rtl":false,"created":"2018-12-25T05:00:00Z","images":["https:\/\/i.snap.as\/r6NbXgI.jpg"],"collection":{"public":false,"alias":"bilge","total_posts":0,"title":"The Psalms","verification_link":"","description":"A <a href=\"https:\/\/davidblue.wtf\/db.vcf\">narcoleptic yokel<\/a> on software and culture.","style_sheet":"","views":177027,"monetization_pointer":""},"paid":false},{"id":"ibotj9eg32l1hr11","body":"![Licking Dark](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/1fep9x4.jpg)\n\n<!--more-->\n\nMy girlfriend very generously offered to go for a drive with me yesterday evening, though neither of us particularly expected to end up parked at 5:40AM outside a little Diner called Ziggie’s some four hours away from home. I managed to learn a bit about driving apps and briefly flood my Jetta’s intake long enough to stall it after fording some flood water a wee bit too rapidly.\n\nSince I’ve begun working in Kansas City and occasionally commuting from Columbia, I’ve found incentive to revisit the crowdsourced driving directions  mobile app [Waze](https:\/\/apple.co\/2PJuh5y), which I recall being very excited about in early 2016. It’s smoother now, yet devoid of that pseudocountercultural sense in a design sense. Functionally, it is still *the* most reliable method of police detection I’ve ever encountered - in this Second Era of my Waze usage I have yet to see a single Missouri Highway Parol car sat in the center of I-70 that hadn’t been reported on Waze first - even at crazy hours on weekday mornings - which should be all the reassurance one needs regarding the immediate future of their userbase.\n\n![Downtown Licking](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/7OdQ3nM.jpg)\n\n> I'm using Waze to drive to to Licking, MO, arriving at 2:24. Watch my drive in real-time on the Waze map! [David Blue on Twitter](https:\/\/t.co\/b6InZBSRdc)  \n\nSomehow, I was unaware until this morning that Waze allows you to “share” your route by generating a link to a web app of theirs that will live track your progress. Though I can’t actually imagine too many use cases for this, I still think it’s cool. Anybody who’s interested in stalking my every move should [follow me on Twitter](http:\/\/twitter.com\/neoyokel) - where I’m sure I’ll be sharing more drives from now on - and\/or DM me and just ask me to enable 24\/7 location-sharing for ya!\n\nOn the topic of mobile apps for those folks like me who’s only real hobby is just fucking driving around, I did actually find mention in a listicle from a *real motoring enthusiast’s publication*. “[Seven Apps That Will Help Improve Your Driving Experience](https:\/\/www.roadandtrack.com\/car-culture\/travel\/tips\/g6477\/seven-best-apps-for-driving-road-assistance\/)” is not exactly the sort of advisory article I remember seeing in *Road & Track* considering that it actually only contains one single app even vaguely related to True *Driving Pleasure* called [Greatest Drive](http:\/\/www.greatestroad.com\/).\n\n> Users contribute their favorite routes and with Yelp integration you can either pick a destination to find the most scenic way to get there or find a good spot to eat along the route you've already chosen.  \n\nOf course, it’s nowhere to be found on the App Store, but it sounded relatively foodist anyway.\n\n## Other notes:\n\n* ***Licking***, Missouri may have a silly name, but [the data says it’s struggling](http:\/\/www.city-data.com\/city\/Licking-Missouri.html).

If I am indeed an authority on myself, I would suggest that these are essential tools rather than crutches, and note that I have made some progress in excusing myself for them out of the (perhaps cliché) realization that “life” - and especially *truth* - can be infinitely complicated, and therefore worthwhile thought on just about anything is inevitably going to be (sometimes aggravatingly) tedious in its complexity.\n\n**I am not a paid journalist** and **I don’t break stories**. That’s not to say that I wouldn’t if an opportunity happened upon me, but it is not where I’m at my best.\n\n### What does *The Psalms* cover?\n\nPrimarily, this blog exists to amplify [undercovered](https:\/\/github.com\/extratone\/bilge\/wiki\/Terminology:-Undercovered) developers, musicians, writers, curators, and media professionals, most often through the process of **analyzing their work**. \n\nSome recent examples include [my interview with Brad Varol](https:\/\/anchor.fm\/davidblue\/episodes\/Brad-Varol--Father-of-Whyp-es12ge), who’s creating a handy web tool for sharing audio (replacing Clyp) and [my guide to music apps on iPhone](https:\/\/bilge.world\/iphone-ios-music-apps).\n\nTwo more *significant* examples: [my interview with Mastodon creator Eugen Rochko](https:\/\/bilge.world\/eugen-rochko-interview) and [my huge case for Bandcamp](https:\/\/bilge.world\/bandcamp-streaming-music) as the streaming service we’ve all been asking for.\n\n[![PixelFed Icon](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/5d3rnfVP.png)](https:\/\/pixelfed.social\/DavidBlue)\n\n### How do you see the world?\n\nAnyone *truly* curious about the answer to this question, for whatever reason, should read my very-autobiographical essay “[Why I Write About Technology](https:\/\/bilge.world\/why)” from 2018, though my perspective has changed quite significantly in the time, since. \n\nI’m going to take further cue from [Casey Newton’s about page format](https:\/\/www.notion.so\/About-Platformer-22cd48a5514d404b9c2dd130d7724b93) and list a few important assumptions of mine about consumer technology in bullet form:\n\n- The delivery of technology media to the mainstream has lessened its ability to truly write critically about the big tech companies it now shares office buildings with.\n- The Open Source\/Open Web community continues to struggle with their *brand image* (if you will) in both old and new ways that needlessly alienate (and sometimes obfuscate) some of their most important contributions from the average user. Technology media has failed in their responsibility to address this issue.\n- Women have had a more than equal share in building the digital age and have yet to be recognized for it. \n- Black people have important contributions of all sorts to technology that have yet to be recognized.\n- The software development community is a source of insights in many aspects of life *other than technology*. It is also often hopelessly blind to others. \n- Technology media has failed to discuss consumer technology’s presence in the lives of working class people, to their own detriment.\n- The narrative surrounding consumer technology has been allowed by technology media to shift from products toward organizations and figureheads, perhaps inevitably. \n- The power dynamics found in the stories of Software History have thus far been underutilized in technology media’s critical eye on the same elements in today’s narratives.\n\n### How do you get your information?\n\nVery likely from the same sources you do. As a \"self-taught\" technology writer, my go-to sources are constantly changing over time. Recently, I have been actively making cold emailing a habit whenever I set upon a given subject, which has produced good results so far. I will more often than not mention any particulars regarding how I found a specific piece of information, reference, web page, etc. *in the post itself*. Handily, [my various Raindrop feeds](https:\/\/raindrop.io\/user\/517010) should prove particularly useful in answering this question in infinite detail. On the social side, [my public Twitter Lists](https:\/\/twitter.com\/NeoYokel\/lists) should perform the same function.\n\n<iframe style=\"border: 0; width: 100%; height: 450px;\" allowfullscreen frameborder=\"0\" src=\"https:\/\/raindrop.io\/davidblue\/embed\/me\/theme=auto\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe>\n\n### How can I interact with *The Psalms*?\n\nEmailing [**davidblue@extratone.com**](mailto:davidblue@extratone.com) and\/or engaging me on [Twitter](https:\/\/twitter.com\/NeoYokel)\/[Mastodon](https:\/\/mastodon.social\/@DavidBlue) are the simplest ways of getting in touch, but for those interested and\/or uncomfortable with those, there are infinitely many more:\n\n- Because *The Psalms* is integrated with the annotation service [Hypothesis](https:\/\/hypothes.is\/), users can literally post public annotations\/page notes ~~via the pullout bar on your right~~ (apparently this isn't currently working unless you have the [Hypothesis extension](https:\/\/web.hypothes.is\/start\/) installed in your browser.)\n- GitHub users can engage with [*The Psalms- Repository](https:\/\/github.com\/extratone\/bilge).

Perhaps inevitably, Eugen Rochko and his gaggle of open source developers have continued to embarrass the living fuck out of Twitter's team - at least for those who've continued to pay attention (i.e. those of us whose sense of aspiration has yet to perish.) \n\nI planned on getting ahead of an innovative wake in iOS development by watching closely for the first \"premium\" Mastodon clients to come out, which I suspected (quite correctly) would carry the first substantial risk-taking on the part of plucky social apps to be seen on the goddamned App Store in what felt like eternity. Unfortunately, I've ended up far too deep in screenshots\/insights from **[Toot!](http:\/\/bit.ly\/tootios)** and **[Mast](http:\/\/bit.ly\/mastios)**, creating a bit of an overwhelming obstacle in comparing and\/or reviewing the two without sinking deep in my regular, pretentious hole.

Is everyone to go off and lock the door and sit secluded like the lonely writers do, in a soundproof cell, summoning people out of words and then proposing that these word people are closer to the real thing than the real people that we mangle with our ignorance every day? The fact remains that getting people right is not what living is all about anyway. It's getting them wrong that is living, getting them wrong and wrong and wrong and then, on careful reconsideration, getting them wrong again. That's how we know we're alive: we're wrong.

She and my stepfather had migrated 18 months or so prior from [Suburban Church of Mediocre Dope Christ-Appropriated Lukewarm Diluted Prog Rock and The Occasional Teachings of Protestant-ish Side-Glances at The New Testament] to the [*New York Times*-appointed champion](https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2014\/02\/23\/movies\/how-the-true-false-film-festival-and-a-church-work-together.html) of Columbia Missouri’s [20-Year-Long](https:\/\/www.komu.com\/news\/mega-church-growth\/) *Quirk the Church!* Sovereignty Crusade: *The Crossing*. Like its competitors (of which my parents’ previous church had ranked quite poorly,) the blatantly death-cult-sounding House of God includes its own artisanal, latte-equipped coffee shop (I wouldn’t be surprised if it’s *actually* a Starbucks affiliate at this point,) a regularly-replenished catering table full of doughnuts immediately to the side as one enters, and a sophisticated childcare operation staffed no less thoroughly than my public elementary school.\n\nSince 2007, the church has been expanding from its first home (as a functional place of worship, anyway,) which lies within 1) line-of-sight from one of [Nancy Walton](https:\/\/www.insidephilanthropy.com\/dance\/2013\/7\/31\/nancy-walton-laurie-ballets-next-best-friend.html)’s properties, 2) a mile of the southernmost exit off US-63 - mid-Missouri’s primary North⟺South roadway - and includes a powered pump-arrogated pond, though the majority of the acreage is blackened by pragmatically-arrayed big box store-caliber multi-rowed parking. Ye, by night, it is flooded in coordinately-distributed cold white light suspended by the same uniform steel poles which guard long-term airport lots. Naturally, the entry and exit points for the asphalt spread are arranged deliberately opposed so that four figures’ worth of God’s children may be fed, digested, and evacuated through their weekly appointment with Christ as efficiently and *hassle-free* as possible.\n\nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=0rhSDfm1ZEc\n\nGod’s ~white~ children become *especially* sensitive to entirely-trivial delay or other perceived deviation from Their Expectations when inside an automobile thanks to a rampant misconception that simultaneously allows them a renewed sense of control over their environment. Psychoanalytic observation has suggested it is catalyzed by delusions of physical anonymity, exemption from civic responsibility, and a titanically-inflated perception of their personally misattributed contributions to the perpetuation of the universe. This vehicular component of the customer experience is a fundamental ingredient in *The Crossing*’s stellar member retinenance record - the single metric above all quantifying a Christian organization’s overall effectiveness in accomplishing the faith’s (mostly cross-denominational) evangelistic Prime Directive \/ General Order Number One as [abridged by Christ himself](https:\/\/www.biblegateway.com\/passage\/?search=Matthew+28%3A18-20&version=NIV) to the Pharisees after his resurrection: “go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of [The Holy Trinity].” I did not take the opportunity to sample *The Crossing*’s baptismal services, but I’m sure sufficient combing of [the church’s Yelp! page](https:\/\/yelp.to\/qTKq\/U3zCk0HlEY) would yield as qualitative an analysis of such a “service” as you could possibly imagine. (Notably, it would appear the “lowest” review is [the singular 4\/5 star entry](https:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz\/the-crossing-columbia?hrid=1iW1Q9KCi9WlM3mDzNFvKw&utm_source=ishare).)\n\nI do not mean to disparage *The Crossing*, specifically nor even organized religion, generally, but instead to emphasize the absurdities which have leapt just as readily into what I’d specifically call *The Business* of white protestant Christianity over just the course of my own maturation as it has into any other aspect of our lives. The difference, of course, is the universal set of exceptions - and the particular *age* of said exceptions - which religion maintains, societally. The perspective formed by my own experiences having grown up wholly embedded across the spectrum of white midwestern Christianity - including two years of vigorous and quite academic study of the Bible in a tiny private school headquartered in the basement of a Lutheran church - lends to a particular skepticism, amusement, horror, offense, and existential astonishment that latches my fascination into a not-entirely-voluntary hold. \n\n(Before I go on, I suppose I should also note that it’s been at least two or three years since I last set foot inside the church building at all - my *only* recent experiences\/engagement with *The Crossing* has been with their digital content from a relative distance.)\n\n![The Crossing’s Pastors](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/E5RLm4y.jpeg)\n![Apple Leadership Headshots](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/B8TX5h0.jpeg)\n\nThe ludicrous parallels between Apple events and services at *The Crossing*, especially, come immediately to mind every single time I watch one (live or otherwise,) as they did just weeks ago when I first engaged with [this summer’s WWDC keynote](https:\/\/youtu.be\/psL_5RIBqnY). Pastors [Dave Cover](https:\/\/www.thecrossingchurch.com\/staff\/dave-cover\/), [Keith Simon](https:\/\/www.thecrossingchurch.com\/staff\/keith-simon\/), and [Shay Roush](https:\/\/www.thecrossingchurch.com\/staff\/shay-roush\/) all look, dress, speak, and photograph *exactly* like Steve Jobs, Tim Cook, Scott Foristell, Jony Ive, and just about any [public-facing leadership figure](https:\/\/www.apple.com\/leadership\/) we’ve ever seen giving an Apple Keynote. They’re hilariously interchangeable, as are other explicit aspects of the typical Sunday morning service at *The Crossing*. As far as I can tell, the church as a whole *only* uses Mac computers and the projections in the main auditorium\/worship hall - mostly sing-along hymn lyrics and referenced bible verses - are exclusively created through Apple’s office presentation software, Keynote, just as the company itself does for its “Keynotes.” This was immediately obvious to me upon first entering that space because **they both use the default theme** - typography, color palette, transition animations and all. Indeed, during the sermons, the three pastors would take command of the slides by fairly inconspicuously clicking what I’d imagine must be a very sweaty Apple Remote in the *exact* same manner in which Tim Cook and his underlings still do.\n\n**I JUST REMEMBERED DAVE EXPLICITLY USING MENTION OF APPLE PRODUCTS IN HIS SERMONS**\n\n![The Crossing on WordPress](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/s1Qh8Rz.jpg)\n\nNay, the likenesses do not diverge when comparing the fundamentals of the two organizations more broadly: *The Business* of the faith is very much a *volume* business, which also describes Apple’s contemporary strategy with perfect precision. It’s been a few years since “[ecosystem](https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/ericjackson\/2014\/06\/03\/apple-isnt-a-hardware-or-software-company-its-an-ecosystem-company\/)” ceased to be an [exhaustive buzzword](‪https:\/\/trends.google.com\/trends\/explore?hl=en-US&tz=300&date=today+5-y&q=apple+ecosystem&sni=3‬) in tech media discourse, perhaps because the term falls very short in expressing the change in global Apple **scale**. My recollection of high school biology has failed to produce a scientific substitute, but I find Matt Honan’s “[very lovely swamp](https:\/\/www.wired.com\/2014\/09\/apple-ecosystem\/)” exceptionally said in 2014, but the fact of the swamp’s becoming generally lovelier in the interim - in a less linear fashion than would have been ideal, mind you - leaves ample room, I think, to fear and respect whatever it was that we then called *The Apple Ecosystem* in 2014 as a **ruling deity or daemon** (just as [Google’s sought to be](https:\/\/extratone.com\/google-soul-ledger-dont-be-evil), recently.)\n\n\nhttps:\/\/twitter.com\/NeoYokel\/status\/825951279910440960\n\n\nThe church [live streams](https:\/\/www.thecrossingchurch.com\/livestream\/) every fucking ~~keynote~~ sermon in HD on *Vimeo*, not *YouTube*. (I had no idea Vimeo offered “[professional streaming services](https:\/\/vimeo.com\/features\/livestreaming)” until this moment.) They have a **[fucking iOS app](https:\/\/apps.apple.com\/us\/app\/the-crossing\/id436071694)** (apparently developed by an outfit called [Subsplash](http:\/\/www.subsplash.com), who had the audacity to include analytics meta tags following the *root of their website* within the in-app attribution button) which features a calendar-bound tool containing full-text preparatory reading material from scripture, on-demand audio and video recordings \n\n![Offerings Function in The Crossing’s iOS App](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/R4Mucv7.jpeg)\n\nI genuinely wonder quite often if the individual who set the digital template for the sign in front of our Portland neighborhood's Episcopalian church paused to look at the text he was arranging: “PRAYER REQUESTS BY EMAIL.” I'm not sure any of this really means anything, but it's sure spectacular to look at. \n\n<!--comment-->\n\n#spectacle #software","views":905,"updated":"2023-03-23T14:11:01Z","tags":["spectacle","software"],"type":null,"title":"Digitizing the Soluble Protestant: Apple, Inc. & The Megachurch Industry","slug":"crossing-church-digital-worship","appearance":"norm","language":"en","rtl":false,"created":"2019-08-04T21:00:00Z","images":["https:\/\/i.snap.as\/s1Qh8Rz.jpg","https:\/\/i.snap.as\/R4Mucv7.jpeg","https:\/\/i.snap.as\/tEE74LR.jpeg","https:\/\/i.snap.as\/E5RLm4y.jpeg","https:\/\/i.snap.as\/B8TX5h0.jpeg"],"collection":{"public":false,"alias":"bilge","total_posts":0,"title":"The Psalms","verification_link":"","description":"A <a href=\"https:\/\/davidblue.wtf\/db.vcf\">narcoleptic yokel<\/a> on software and culture.","style_sheet":"","views":177027,"monetization_pointer":""},"paid":false},{"id":"0ee0f2s3r86yqk6r","body":"![David Blue Sleepy Transit](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/vKRnLSy.jpeg)\n\n------\n\nhttp:\/\/extratone.com\/\nhttp:\/\/bilge.world\nhttp:\/\/asphaltapostle.tumblr.com\/\nhttps:\/\/davidblue.bandcamp.com\/\nhttps:\/\/bandcamp.com\/davidblue\nhttp:\/\/vk.com\/davidblue\nhttps:\/\/500px.com\/NeoYokel\nhttps:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/User:Extratone\nhttps:\/\/facebook.com\/asphaltapostle\nhttps:\/\/flickr.com\/davidblue\nhttps:\/\/imgur.com\/user\/NeoYokel\nhttps:\/\/getpocket.com\/@extratone\nhttps:\/\/github.com\/neoyokel\nhttps:\/\/instagram.com\/asphaltapostle\nhttps:\/\/linkedin.com\/in\/cyberyokel\nhttps:\/\/medium.com\/@NeoYokel\nhttps:\/\/open.spotify.com\/user\/12186620218\nhttps:\/\/open.audio\/@DavidBlue \nhttps:\/\/snapchat.com\/add\/mommilitia\nhttps:\/\/soundcloud.com\/chordoslut\nhttps:\/\/twitter.com\/NeoYokel\nhttps:\/\/vimeo.com\/extratone\nhttps:\/\/vine.co\/asphaltapostle\nhttps:\/\/www.imdb.com\/name\/extratone\nhttps:\/\/www.last.fm\/user\/Crazyhooligin\nhttps:\/\/www.twitch.tv\/Dieselgoth\nhttps:\/\/www.yelp.com\/user_details?userid=seYjUMcixeGvpOehekSOXg\nhttps:\/\/youtube.com\/extratone\nhttps:\/\/peertube.live\/accounts\/extratone\/videos\nhttps:\/\/pixelfed.social\/Davidblue\nhttps:\/\/pleroma.tilde.zone\/b\nhttps:\/\/tilde.zone\/@b\nhttps:\/\/writing.exchange\/@b\nhttps:\/\/diasp.org\/public\/davidblue\nhttp:\/\/davidblue@diasp.org\/\nhttp:\/\/fedigram.social\/davidblue\nhttp:\/\/mastodon.social\/@DavidBlue\nhttp:\/\/mastodon.technology\/@DavidBlue\nhttp:\/\/radical.town\/@DavidBlue\nhttp:\/\/toot.cafe\/@DavidBlue\nhttp:\/\/www.extratone.com\/tech\/mastodon\/\nhttps:\/\/baptiste.gelez.xyz\/@\/davidblue\/\nhttps:\/\/dolphin.town\/@e_4030\nhttps:\/\/expshift.com\/@b\nhttps:\/\/fosstodon.org\/@DavidBlue\nhttps:\/\/github.com\/Plume-org\/Plume\nhttps:\/\/linuxrocks.online\/@blue\nhttps:\/\/mastd.racing\/@blue","views":791,"updated":"2019-08-05T23:31:54Z","tags":[],"type":null,"title":"David Blue Master Link Index","slug":"links","appearance":"sans","language":"en","rtl":false,"created":"2019-08-05T23:31:32Z","images":["https:\/\/i.snap.as\/vKRnLSy.jpeg"],"collection":{"public":false,"alias":"bilge","total_posts":0,"title":"The Psalms","verification_link":"","description":"A <a href=\"https:\/\/davidblue.wtf\/db.vcf\">narcoleptic yokel<\/a> on software and culture.","style_sheet":"","views":177027,"monetization_pointer":""},"paid":false},{"id":"b4t9rvi4y23lye5y","body":"#### by [David Blue](http:\/\/twitter.com\/neoyokel)\n\n![\"Mannequin Challenge\" by SAINT PEPSI](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/ngnhn2U.jpg)\n\n## Counterfeit record *Mannequin Challenge* proves to be a lively, heartfelt reflection for cassettehype lovers.\n\nIn a surprising turn of events, an anonymous actor uploaded, metatagged, and published **[a fabulous futuredisco tape](https:\/\/saintpepsi.bandcamp.com\/album\/mannequin-challenge)** this evening on [the official Bandcamp page](https:\/\/saintpepsi.bandcamp.com) owned by the KEATs-affiliated Groove Guru using stolen credentials.

I am more German-looking than not, perhaps. Supposedly, I am half a product of a very large family whose elders are only one and two generations from German royalty - my legal last name is on a state sign in front of a small black castle somewhere in *Der Vaterland*. I slacked through two years of high school German language classes - Frau Rosa once took me aside to ask *you’re not going to shoot up the school or anything, right?* (Sorry Frau & peers.) Though my much-older half siblings grew up mostly in the town of Schweinfurt, I have never actually set foot in Germany, yet I’ve come to identify with and admire its culture enough to (perhaps unjustly or inappropriately) feel comfortable joking about Deutsche peculiarities as vain self-mockery.\n\n<iframe width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/REchJ_BD5G0?controls=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe>\n\nDespite all of this (carefully nationalism-free) affection, the real truth of myself is an American one. I have long since broached the point of no return: no matter how hard I might try, I would never be able to mold the Me another perceives in such a way that I’d become observably German-native. I’m just a midwestern boy with a Germanic name on his paperwork, and therefore have more in common with Volkswagen’s newish entry into the *dramatically* different full-size Sport Utility Vehicle segment. The Atlas bears a [remarkably good name](https:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2016-11-17\/what-s-in-an-suv-name-redemption-with-u-s-consumers-vw-hopes) (annoyingly, [literally everyone's reviews](https:\/\/www.thedrive.com\/new-cars\/9083\/the-2018-volkswagen-atlas-finally-solves-vws-america-problem) seem to begin with a comment on how *decipherable* the new name is for Americans) - especially among new automotive products introduced to market in recent memory. Honda’s *Clarity* **should** be clever alongside the definitively 21st-century *Insight* marque, but violates an unfortunately universal law in the industry: never name a car for a *state of being* (Introducing the New 2020 Honda *Ambiguity* [*Insolence*, *Fugue*, *Debacle*, *Setback*]) ~especially~ one so obtusely irrelevant to the product itself. *Insight* comes from a chat with a colleague over coffee, but *Clarity* is a metaphysical, zealous plane that sounds our ever-inadequate platitude alarms in a very unsettling manner. *Um... Is Honda doing okay?* It not only ends up irritating and off-putting: after Hannah’s season of *The Bachelorette*, it’s just dumb, lazy, and foul.\n\n> After decades of trying to force Yankees into models that many found too small, VW has figured it out: Big-ass SUVs are what Americans want, and the Atlas is designed around the biggest asses you can imagine.\n\nIn contrast, the fucking Nissan *Kicks* ages so swiftly and uncomfortably that it’s pitifully tacky before it even hits the lot, which is particularly disappointing considering the most cleverly bestowed *Juke* name was. One marvels at the situation Nissan has found itself in: *young American black men love our brand, but they also love shoes!* Atlas, though, is on par with Honda’s *Odyssey* inspirationally, though a smidge more grounded through the distinctly Earthen science of topography, just as it should be. Originally billed as a replacement for [VW’s Routan minivan](https:\/\/www.usatoday.com\/story\/money\/cars\/2013\/09\/23\/vw-routan-suv-crossblue\/2856593\/), the three-row Atlas is Volkswagen’s newest bid for the Panic Room-loving American parent demographic. Therefore, it’s crucial for us to examine it thoroughly for [any signs of condescension](https:\/\/www.businessinsider.com\/vw-atlas-crossover-suv-review-2017-11) from the Germans and their brand “whose business in the US is built on providing small, fun-to-drive cars like the Golf, the Beetle, the Jetta, and the Passat.”\n\n> From our perspective, what we have here is a German take on the American family SUV. A Ford Explorer by way of Wolfsburg, if you will. Well, sort of. The Atlas is actually built in Chattanooga, Tennessee alongside the Passat sedan.\n\nUnavoidably, the most notable, remarkable, and extraordinary item to note about the Atlas is simply that **it is fucking fat**. Just about any review you watch or read will mention this. Even *CNET* calls theirs \"[a very broad boy](https:\/\/www.cnet.com\/roadshow\/reviews\/2019-volkswagen-atlas-review\/).\" After I first read the number - **5997 lbs.** - I was never able to escape it throughout the entirety of my time with it. ***Three tons*** is unbelievably, inexcusably, violently, hopelessly heavy. *Hopelessly* not because it stands out in its segment, but that [*it does not*](https:\/\/cdn.discordapp.com\/attachments\/457289420174000150\/698509904629202996\/2017_Vehicles_with_GVW_over_6000_lbs.pdf). Obesity is still a problem in America, but it's our automobiles now. While we continue to worship safety and fuel economy together, we skew the triangle (the other side is performance) further and further, and yes – a good portion of the blame can be placed on [our obsession with SUVs](https:\/\/www.npr.org\/2016\/05\/09\/477301486\/why-americans-are-buying-more-trucks-and-suvs-than-cars). I spent 2018 driving a 1976 Lincoln Continental Mk. IV around - the second-longest two-door car ever sold at 228.1 inches from its pointed nose to its massive ass. Despite being a full *thirty inches longer* than the 2019 Atlas, my 460-powered mammoth yacht weighed some 700 pounds *less*, and it was filled with *real wood*. I'm no expert in physics by any means, but I can tell you that every pound has [expounding effects](https:\/\/www.nrcan.gc.ca\/sites\/www.nrcan.gc.ca\/files\/oee\/pdf\/transportation\/fuel-efficient-technologies\/autosmart_factsheet_16_e.pdf) on the energy required to move, turn, and stop a vehicle, which just about sums up the ultimate formula to [pulverize efficiency](https:\/\/www.autoblog.com\/2009\/10\/29\/greenlings-how-does-weight-affect-a-vehicles-efficiency). When our friends at the IIHS say that \"fuel economy can be improved without sacrificing safety,\" they are just... **fundamentally wrong**, (though *technically* correct.)\n\nI'm not entirely sure why the Atlas weighs so much, but its mass is inevitably a major variable in just about every facet of its experience as a product. The best potential hoot to be had from it as a driving device should be sought by ordering it to shuffle briskly on curving country blacktops in Sport Mode with all the assists (save for lane-keeping) *on*. Not to be too crude, but it's fun to make the fat fucker run. Through your ass, you can feel the suspension squirm and struggle to redirect all [266 lb.-ft. of VR6 oomf between 4 wheels](https:\/\/www.motortrend.com\/cars\/volkswagen\/atlas\/2018\/2018-volkswagen-atlas-se-long-term-update-1-review\/) beneath an entirely separate war against the physics of such top-heavy body roll.\n\n*Scrambling* is definitely the correct verb. Pleasantly light steering in Comfort Mode (where I'd advise you leave it in virtually any situation) combined with a supple-ish ride from multilink suspension provide a trace of a past luxury sentiment not unlike the energy exhibited by my old Connie through and through. It's all about the sensation of **power**. Not in the horse sense, but in the satisfaction achieved from the manipulation of maximum mass with minimum effort. Comparatively, the level of actual ego-stroking is of course quite miniscule, and unfortunately, it is the numbness that is most noticeably left over with very little gain.\n\nAlso unfortunate: I did not end up making the opportunity to truly test whatever offroad capabilities the Atlas may posses in any sort of formalized test. My example came with Hill Descent Control and Hill Start Assist, and I was able to find a small hill just steep enough to [trigger the former](https:\/\/youtu.be\/REchJ_BD5G0?t=232). I cannot say I'd put my money on the Atlas winning the Dakar as it is, but we now know it can handle wet grass on a mild incline. What about county road gravel? Realistically, these are the two extremes 99% of Atlas' will ever face in their usable service lives. I found an entirely quiet section of back rock road and [walked through the steps](https:\/\/youtu.be\/REchJ_BD5G0?t=321) to disable all of the traction and stability control assists before stomping on the throttle, but was unable to provoke any significant wheelspin. In [an episode of *Autoline After Hours*](https:\/\/www.spreaker.com\/user\/autoline\/aah-382-can-the-atlas-lift-volkswagen_3), Michael Loveti (Vice President, Product Line Mid\/Full-Size, Volkswagen Group of America, Inc.) confirms the drivetrain *really is* **all-time all-wheel-drive**, (though the dual exhaust ports in the rear are [unfortunately fake](https:\/\/youtu.be\/wCTUgQ-X4mw?t=395),) and that the Atlas is actually based on [the MQB platform](https:\/\/www.motortrend.com\/news\/explaining-volkswagen-mqb-architecture\/), which is astonishing. Prospective buyers should definitely have a listen.\n\n<iframe src=\"https:\/\/widget.spreaker.com\/player?episode_id=17362733&theme=light&autoplay=false&playlist=false\" width=\"100%\" height=\"200px\" frameborder=\"0\"><\/iframe>\n\nThis theme of \"thoroughly German, yet somehow distinctly Americanized\" occurs [over](https:\/\/www.digitaltrends.com\/car-reviews\/2019-volkswagen-atlas-review) and [over](https:\/\/arstechnica.com\/cars\/2018\/04\/the-volkswagen-atlas-reviewed-a-peoples-wagon-for-the-american-people\/) and [over](https:\/\/www.consumerreports.org\/suvs\/2018-volkswagen-atlas-suv-first-drive-review) and [over](https:\/\/youtu.be\/wCTUgQ-X4mw?t=444) again in the Atlas' story. Its horizontal lines match both the Jetta and Ford's Explorer. In that way, surely it is a success. I cannot imagine a better execution of its marque's directives as stated by Mr. Loveti than what I drove.\n\n> Cover the Volkswagen logo and you might think the Atlas was made by someone else. The hard lines and boxy shape are a sharp departure from the rest of the VW lineup. But look at its competitors here in the states, especially the Ford Explorer. It’s almost like Volkswagen tried to build its own Ford with the Atlas.\n\n> Even though it has been on the market for only a year, the Atlas had become VW's second-most-popular car in the German automaker's lineup in March 2018, showing that the American car-buying public's thirst for crossovers and SUVs remains unslaked.\n\n### Place in The Segment\n\nThe only other modern SUVs I've spent significant time with was the Range Rover Evoque I crashed and the VW Tiguan I reluctantly borrowed (and had [absolutely nothing](https:\/\/twitter.com\/search?q=\"Tiguan\" %40neoyokel&src=typed_query&f=live) to say about,) so my authority in comparing the Atlas with its competitors is severely lacking. However, I can at least send you the way of *Regular Car Reviews*' [Roman reviewing his mother's Ford Explorer](https:\/\/youtu.be\/Dij6fkrOSfs), *Business Insider*'s [direct comparison between their long termer Atlas and the Explorer](https:\/\/youtu.be\/Dij6fkrOSfs), or *Cars.com*'s [vs. the new Subaru Ascent](https:\/\/www.cars.com\/articles\/subaru-ascent-vs-volkswagen-atlas-the-family-suv-feud-begins-1420700698096\/). *Car & Driver* also [compared the Atlas to the intriguing Kia Telluride](https:\/\/www.caranddriver.com\/reviews\/comparison-test\/a27354538\/2020-kia-telluride-vs-2019-volkswagen-atlas\/).\n\n> In the splitting of already fine hairs, it's the new Telluride that makes a stronger case over the Atlas, thanks to its price advantage, its plush and thoughtful appointments, and its slightly more comfortable third-row.\n\n## The Passive Safety Fairytale\n\n**Define**: [Active safety](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Active_safety)\n\n**Freedom through security**. In truth, neurotypical people are naturally driven to minimize risk, yet also to romanticize the sick, inhibitionless madmen - to envy them both internally and externally (in a most restrained way.) Collectively, our authority in (or mastery of) risktaking remains pathetically irrational. If we were to itemize our ability to asses risk into a sixth physical sense, it would rank just as poorly against the rest of the world's creatures (or perhaps neck-and-neck with those of the squirrel or the deer.)\n\nSo many struggles of the too-often-cited \"Human Condition\" are grounded in the incompetence of this sense. It shouldn't be surprising, then, that risktakers in general are a very special topic amid The Middle Class - those who occasionally find themselves atop *just* enough excess to call it \"capital.\" This equates in day-to-day life as only the most potent - yet almost entirely inert next to the cushion of multi-millionaires - subject, catalyst, and indicator of dire fret. By far the most widespread affectation of this petty affliction spreads like divine wrath over the upper forty percent of this Middle Class. Thus, we must ask ourselves *how safe doth the Atlas make me feel*?\n\n![Volkswagen Atlas Digital Dash](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/boo7eIM.jpg)\n\n### Inside\n\nMy Atlas’ interior was finished in Titan Black Leatherette, which sounds both grandiose and a bit like a kink. \"Volkswagen is known for good build quality and tight-feeling interiors,\" [writes Danny Geraghty](https:\/\/www.auto123.com\/en\/car-reviews\/2019-volkswagen-atlas-review\/65887\/) for *Auto123*, \"but I found I was encountering just a bit too much hard plastic, making for a somewhat dated feel.\" Perhaps my loaner was less worn in because neither I nor my girlfriend found anything wrong with the Atlas’ interior quality – even after bombing gravel roads to the point of sustaining a left-rear puncture, we did not encounter any annoying squeaks or rattles. She spent an entire afternoon sleeping in the passenger’s seat reclined and described it as “comfy.” For [*The Car Connection*](https:\/\/www.thecarconnection.com\/news\/1109777_2018-volkswagen-atlas-first-drive-super-sized), Senior Editor Andrew Ganz writes:\n\n> It’s not much to behold, with a chunky shape as conservative as they come that is not offset by a distinct lack of flair inside. Instead, the Atlas is quietly competent and exceptionally good at carrying seven humans—even seven adults.\n\nStandard with the SEL trim is Volkswagen’s “Digital Cockpit” instrument panel, which I like much more than I expected to, though its color options are already dated and [unfortunately unchangeable](https:\/\/www.periscope.tv\/AsphaltApostle\/1nAKEZmYpQOGL?t=4m12s). Ageability is an inevitable issue with these sorts of bespoke graphic design decisions automakers are making now, but at least you’ll be able to tell your friends that your Volkswagen has a digital dashboard “just like the Rolls-Royce Phantom,” which is, of course, the ultimate Queen of timelessness in the industry. Perhaps it’s telling that the only layout I found acceptable for the digital dash was the one with simulated analog needles for the tach and speedo, and how often do you *really* use a compass in day-to-day driving? For that matter, how useful could a digital compass in the speedometer’s center hub really be in an “offroad” situation? It’s a bit petty, but I also really despise the typeface shared across the instruments and infotainment system. It’s just… bad.\n\n![2019 Volkwagen Atlas SEL w\/4MOTION](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/uh6I3EF.jpg)\n\n### Outside\n\nIn Platinum Gray Metallic, the Atlas looks authoritative enough in a very ordinary way. Unless you’re on the lookout for one, you’d hardly notice it, and you certainly wouldn’t expect what you see to cost as much as it does. That is why I’d prefer *any* one of the [other exterior finishes](https:\/\/web.archive.org\/save\/https:\/www.elginvw.com\/blog\/what-colors-does-the-2019-volkswagen-atlas-come-in\/), especially (in order): Pure White, Tourmaline Blue Metallic, Pacific Blue Metallic, and Fortana Red. The real wonder is how VW managed to execute a seven-seat SUV with its existing design language. Though the Atlas is by far Volkswagen’s largest vehicle, it fits neatly within their lineup.\n\n<iframe style=\"border: solid 1px #dedede;\"  src=\"https:\/\/app.stitcher.com\/splayer\/f\/52690\/50908015\" width=\"220\" height=\"150\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe>\n\n## Road Rage\n\nMy only authentic Road Rage experience in some 5000 miles of rideshare driving occurred on All Hallow's Eve when I stopped - no more illegally than usual - on the opposite corner from a popular downtown Mexican restaurant called The Nap with hazards and all courtesy interior lights shining. The car immediately behind me hesitated no more than necessary, but the Biggest Big Infiniti behind them (a QX80 - the Atlas' competitor) just... stopped. There was honking and frenzied, hoarse screaming of *what the fuck are you doing?* and such.\n\nI responded with pleasantly amused but relatively-encouraging glances at the impersonal black mass of the Infiniti's windshield through my mirrors. I rolled down the Atlas' driver's side window and politely gestured that they go around me, but failed to coax any movement whatsoever from the ugly behemoth through at least two full cycles of the nearby traffic light. There must be some aquatic authority in the bulbous black ass of the QX80, for no one behind it seemed willing to pass either. The driver waited significantly longer than you'd imagine before emerging, huffy. She was wearing a classic poofy black North Face vest some sort of slate gray turtleneck. Nothing below these were stimulating enough to retain any memory of. *Uggs?*\n\nHow positive are *you* that the truth has absolutely zero consequence: contrasted silver-beige eyeliner and little eye contact, dirty-ish straight blonde hair over a spray-tanned face, exhibiting zero anxious tics or hesitation. She was obviously the New Matriarch, and she was obviously *much* more of an authority on traffic law than I. As she approached, she scanned the street as one naturally does when they enter a busy one... except it was completely empty, thanks to her blockade. She first informed me that I was \"not *supposed*\" to be stopped there. I tried to listen and respond with as much sincerity as possible as I realized all at once that my behavior had genuinely *perturbed* this woman - that her choice to leave the huge hideous warmth of the guppy wagon to speak as humans to one another required great courage. \n\n![2019 Volkwagen Atlas SEL w\/4MOTION and Prius-C](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/ZATOFIE.jpg)\n\nI inserted the next logical question which I'd been screaming telepathically: *can you not get around me?* I began to pity her when I then saw in her face the distinct possibility that *going around* as a concept had not occurred to her whatsoever. She stuttered a wee bit in retorting \"I could go around, but I don't want to get a ticket.\" Here, one of the most fascinating avenues of suburban psychology is explored: Guppy Mom is not being ingenuine with this expression, nor has she had an untoward experience with law enforcement, ever. Guppy Mom did know her excuse was bullshit - nobody has ever been written a traffic citation for carefully circumventing an obstacle in the road. Given the opportunity to interrogate this kernel of entirely uncompromising obedience to utterly delusional traffic law superstitions, I think we'd simply discover a life of unnaturally positive interactions with LEOs. We must conclude, then, that the source of her fear was either myself or the Atlas.\n\nGranted, to her I am still a *Young Man*, and am therefore instinctively programmed to believe myself more informed than literally everyone - even the very foundational architects of modern civilization. Her Stucco Highness may have felt a representative of these builders (edgy take: *she is in fact their servant*.) Her own folks surely complain regularly about their distaste for disrespect, and my gig-economy, Austin Powers-looking ass was somehow disrespecting the order laid down by her would be (entirely fantastical) forefathers. Though her expression of her quaint fear of such \"ugliness\" (if you will) is hard-headed, an ugliest decision of hers (or her kin) idled behind me, its giant seafood-looking mouth gaping, unhinged. It'd almost be more redeemable if it was a hardcore, chronic mouthbreather. (The QX80 is actually [powered by a comparatively oldschool V8](https:\/\/www.autoguide.com\/auto-news\/2019\/05\/2019-infiniti-qx80-pros-and-cons.html).)\n\nFreedom from fear is the sum desire of all the most primitive compulsions we share. Ultimately, the only efficient and reasonable response to Mrs. Guppy's kind in such a situation is to very kindly oblige, which I did, of course, with great respect and great pity. In the months since this encounter, I'd been wondering what was missing from the outline of this Atlas review. I recently realized that it is this analysis of fear as a factor for the American carbuyer.\n\nThough it has been disproven over and over again for [decades](http:\/\/www.accessmagazine.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/7\/2016\/07\/access21-01-are-suvs-really-safer-than-cars.pdf), consumers often cite *safety* as their primary motivation for buying full-sized SUVs. Mrs. Guppy's Great Guffaw led me to realize why this particularly disconnected supposition\/folktale continues to thrive so uninhibited by the truth: the *brand image*, physical presence, and actual driving sensation must communicate and \"feel\" **safe** - these are far more integral to buyers' perception of a product than the testable reality. Even the people of the [world's most Christian nation](https:\/\/www.pewresearch.org\/fact-tank\/2019\/04\/01\/the-countries-with-the-10-largest-christian-populations-and-the-10-largest-muslim-populations\/) do not have faith - they trust not unless they see with their own eyes; feel with their own asses. They entrust their souls to the Word of the Lord, but not their lives to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. (I recently gave both of mine to NHTSA for All Eternity.)\n\n![2019 Volkwagen Atlas SEL w\/4MOTION](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/63zglSP.jpg)\n\n### The Collegiate Take\n\nThe two or three nights I spent Uber\/Lyft driving around my college town shuttling Halloween party traffic in the Atlas were expectedly uneventful. I had to create a preset text message to send immediately upon connection with a rider to communicate as succinctly as possible that I was *not* going to be arriving in the Jetta Sportwagen on my profile but instead in the Atlas, and to transparently try to make sure that was okay. (No, drivers are not supposed to do this and you should reserve the right to bail on a ride should you find yourself opposite my own position in this situation because nobody refused me.)\n\n> Hello! Just a heads up: My Jetta is in the shop so I'm driving a **gray 2019 Volkswagen Atlas**\n>\n> (It's VW's largest SUV and has 7 seats.)\n>\n> License: **FATLAS**\n>\n> If this is inconvenient or uncomfortable for you, please let me know.\n>\n> Thank you!\n\nI made a point to try and ask most of the riders if they had any thoughts on the Atlas without sounding like I was just desperately fishing for compliments on my own car, but I don't remember any significant thoughts being imparted whatsoever - certainly nothing negative. Folks here are just too polite - they won't speak up no matter how many times you insist that you *do not own the car*. We experienced this phenomena years ago when we tried to [interview people on the street](https:\/\/youtu.be\/MLYdky3BKa4?t=443) regarding the horrid Nissan Murano CrossCabriolet. Regardless, there's no reason to expect young people to have anything to say about the Atlas - it is neither extraordinary nor cheap.\n\nIf you are an American carbuyer, you might give a shit about the sort of awards manufacturers love to quote in their television commercials like [the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety's \"TOP SAFETY PICK,\"](https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20180108051011\/http:\/www.iihs.org\/iihs\/news\/desktopnews\/new-volkswagen-suv-earns-2017-top-safety-pick-award) which the Atlas won for 2017. For 2019, it won [*MotorWeek*'s Best Large Utility Driver's Choice award](https:\/\/media.vw.com\/en-us\/releases\/1123). How about [*Cars.com*'s 2020 Family Car of The Year](https:\/\/www.cars.com\/awards\/2020\/family-car-of-the-year\/)? How quickly can this story turn into [churnalized](https:\/\/www.torquenews.com\/3769\/second-year-vw-atlas-wins-motorweek-suv-award) commercial copy? From Scott Keogh, Volkswagen Group America CEO:\n\n> [Atlas] was designed and built specifically for American families, and buyers and critics alike are letting us know that we’re hitting the mark with this seven-seater SUV.\n\nIt's immediately evident from the outside that the Atlas is the most Americanized product in Volkswagen's lineup - indeed, [in its entire history](https:\/\/www.thedrive.com\/new-cars\/9083\/the-2018-volkswagen-atlas-finally-solves-vws-america-problem). For [*Car Magazine*'s review](https:\/\/www.carmagazine.co.uk\/car-reviews\/volkswagen\/vw-atlas-2017-review\/), Ben Barry notes \"the square-jawed front, Jeep-like wheel arches, and the suggestive utilitarianism of the stampings in the bonnet and roof\" before remarking on [just how much more you can spend](https:\/\/www.vw.com\/builder\/tab\/trim\/model\/touareg\/) on the Porsche Cayenne's cousin, the beloved Touareg.\n\n> Ultimately, the Atlas is far from a dynamic, agile machine, but it feels comfortable and unintimidating to drive, and perfectly at home on US city streets and the slower-paced driving of California highways.\n\n![2019 VW Atlas V6 28 mpg](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/FI9Hd6A.jpg)\n\n![2019 VW Atlas V6 28 mpg](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/nsYN1ax.jpg)\n\n## Efficiency, the Other Fixation\n\nSurprisingly, the Atlas carries a rare and precious jewel of automotive history under its broad, satisfying hood. The VR6 \"zig zag\" arrangement is actually one of [Volkswagen legend](https:\/\/www.roadandtrack.com\/car-culture\/a9988768\/volkswagen-vr6-dying\/) - defining icons like the Corrado. As [Dan Prosser explains for *Evo* magazine](https:\/\/www.evo.co.uk\/volkswagen\/corrado): \n\n> ‘VR’ stands for V-Reihenmotor, which translates to V-Inline, describing both vee and inline cylinder layouts. That is, of course, contradictory. The unit is actually a very narrow-angle V6, displacing 2861cc, with two offset banks of cylinders at 15 degrees to one another. Unlike a conventional V6, but exactly like an inline six, there’s just one cylinder head. The result is a six-cylinder engine that’s both much narrower than a typical V6 and shorter than a straight six. In fact, it’s more comparable in size to a four-cylinder than a six, which meant it could slot easily into a Golf floorpan. A creative and borderline ingenious engineering solution.\n\nThe Atlas' 3.6L VR6 makes 276 hp and 266 lb-ft. of torque. Though [other reviews](https:\/\/www.motortrend.com\/cars\/volkswagen\/atlas\/2018\/2018-volkswagen-atlas-se-long-term-update-3-review\/) cited highway mileage figures of 23-25 mpg, I was able to coax a whole *twenty-eight* miles-per-gallon on a [live Periscope stream](https:\/\/www.pscp.tv\/AsphaltApostle\/1MnxnEBYwgdJO) without air conditioning or cruise control through a two-way simulated 20 minute commute, through which I suffered for the hard data. My average before resetting the odometer for that feat, though, was 14.7mpg. \"Good range and miles between trips to the gas station are criteria I look for in a good car, and the fuel-gulping Atlas rates low in this department\" may be the blandest statement of all time, but *MotorTrend* does have a point – with the same 18.6 gallon fuel tank shared between the four and six cylinder models, the latter realistically has 250 miles of range between fillups, which is pitiful for a modern vehicle in just about any segment. [Crossing one State](https:\/\/goo.gl\/maps\/cW8GwjGNRhnffo2Y9) is not enough.\n\nhttps:\/\/vimeo.com\/406373165\n\n![2019 Volkwagen Atlas SEL w\/4MOTION](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/YaLfPD9.jpg)\n\n## An Attempted Conclusion\n\nSo, is the Atlas indeed just a lucrative German prank on Americans? If it is, the subtleties are beyond even me. In the time since I drove the Atlas last year, [Volkswagen has unleashed](https:\/\/www.caranddriver.com\/reviews\/a31215717\/2020-vw-atlas-cross-sport-drive\/) the Atlas Cross Sport on American roads. Apparently, it is [the ideal SUV for \"dual incomes, no kids](https:\/\/www.autoweek.com\/drives\/a31151883\/the-2020-volkswagen-atlas-cross-sport-is-the-suv-for-dinks\/),\" or \"DINKS\" (surprisingly, not a homophobic slur.) *MotorTrend*, on the other hand, argues the ideal buyer has \"[teenagers who are growing faster than dandelions](https:\/\/www.motortrend.com\/cars\/volkswagen\/atlas-cross-sport\/2020\/2020-volkswagen-atlas-cross-sport-interior-review\/).\"\n\n> It's a straightforward conversion from Atlas to Atlas Cross Sport. In the name of perceived sportiness, out goes that most minivan of things: the third row of seats.\n\nNormally, I'd be disgusted with such a thing, but from where I'm sitting, the Cross Sport *appears* to be what the Atlas should've been all along. The third row seats in my example wasn't any more comfortable than that of a 10-year-old minivan, so removing them for the sake of the second makes perfect sense. According to *Car & Driver*, [the 2021 Atlas will \"adopt\" the Cross Sport's styling](https:\/\/www.caranddriver.com\/news\/a30186943\/vw-atlas-2021-preview\/), though there are some technologies - like road sign recognition- which are [exclusive to the Cross Sport](https:\/\/www.caranddriver.com\/news\/a29105149\/vw-atlas-cross-sport-2020-tech-features\/).\n\n> Instead of getting 20.6 cubic feet of cargo space behind the third row in the Atlas, you get 40.3 behind the second row. Fold that down and it becomes 77.8 cubic feet to work with. And that’s from an SUV with the same wheelbase as the upcoming 2021 Atlas at 117.3 inches, yet it is 5.2 inches shorter and 2.2 inches lower to the ground.\n\nThere was even a [one-off concept Atlas pickup called the Tanorak](https:\/\/www.autocar.co.uk\/car-news\/new-cars\/first-drive-volkswagen-atlas-tanoak-pick-concept), and no one seems to yet know whether or not it (or something similar) will be put into production. As far as longevity and extended livability is concerned, enough time has passed since the Atlas' release for long-termer conclusion posts to be published from the likes of [*Car & Driver*](https:\/\/www.caranddriver.com\/reviews\/a26897709\/2019-volkswagen-atlas-reliability-maintenance\/), [*Cars.com*](https:\/\/www.cars.com\/articles\/2018-volkswagen-atlas-road-trip-kansas-city-here-we-come-1420702979148\/), and [*MotorTrend*](https:\/\/www.motortrend.com\/cars\/volkswagen\/atlas\/2018\/2018-volkswagen-atlas-se-long-term-verdict\/). The last of these reported an [odd turning radius issue](https:\/\/www.motortrend.com\/cars\/volkswagen\/atlas\/2018\/2018-volkswagen-atlas-se-long-term-update-4-review\/) which was eventually [fixed by Volkswagen](https:\/\/www.motortrend.com\/cars\/volkswagen\/atlas\/2018\/2018-volkswagen-atlas-se-long-term-update-5-review\/).\n\n> Once we got the steering fixed, my opinion of the Atlas did grow sunnier, though it's still not perfect. Maybe it's not fair to compare the driving experience to my previous long-term vehicle, the slightly smaller Mazda CX-9, but in my opinion the Mazda still sets the ride and handling bar for the competitive set. Setting the Mazda aside, if you hop behind the wheel of one of the newer competitors like the Kia Telluride, there's a noticeable disparity in the refinement in ride quality and body control in the Atlas... **Volkswagen should have made the GTI of three-row SUVs, not just another minivan alternative**.\n\nThis pullquote from [Andrew Ganz’s *The Car Connection* review](https:\/\/www.thecarconnection.com\/overview\/volkswagen_atlas_2018) is as good a summary as I could ever come up with:\n\n> The 2018 Volkswagen Atlas does little wrong, but it's light on personality and a little low-rent inside—and it guzzles fuel. It's worth a look, but mostly rivals do more for less.\n\nVolkswagen’s first substantial entry into the SUV market is well-named, relatively well-endowed, fairly bland for its price tag, and very, very heavy. Also, Start\/Stop is still unbearable – thanks Obama – but the Atlas is not a scam.\n\n🗎 [**Print\/PDF**](https:\/\/eileenlong-my.sharepoint.com\/:b:\/g\/personal\/david_eileenlonglcsw_com\/EaroYKb0EkpCmNWXZfff08cBsqpjSx4q6t_sl5y1Asbizw?e=aiWx97)\n\n![2019 Volkswagen Atlas V6 SEL 4Motion Options as Tested](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/SeRBqGI.jpg)\n\n* [**2019 Volkswagen Atlas Technical Specifications**](https:\/\/eileenlong-my.sharepoint.com\/:b:\/g\/personal\/david_eileenlonglcsw_com\/EU8sW8HoIi9Dv7yfHyzY9RsB169foMvzXrEurtQzM4v0TA?e=myVb5V)\n\n* [**2019 Volkswagen Atlas Pricing**](https:\/\/eileenlong-my.sharepoint.com\/:b:\/g\/personal\/david_eileenlonglcsw_com\/ET3qaPIGju1DlvqiNerFu4UBeblZMtEqmnbT4XC1PdLe0g?e=PpB1uT)\n\n## Further Reading\n\n- \"[Why Americans Are Buying More Trucks And SUVs Than Cars](https:\/\/www.npr.org\/2016\/05\/09\/477301486\/why-americans-are-buying-more-trucks-and-suvs-than-cars)\" | *NPR*\n- \"[SUVs are safer than cars in front crashes, but there is more to the story](https:\/\/www.consumerreports.org\/cro\/news\/2013\/05\/suvs-are-safer-than-cars-in-front-crashes-but-there-is-more-to-the-story\/index.htm)\" | *Consumer Reports*\n- \"[2017 Volkswagen Atlas revealed for US market](https:\/\/www.autocar.co.uk\/car-news\/motor-shows-la-motor-show\/2017-volkswagen-atlas-revealed-us-market)\" | *Autocar*\n- \"[Volkswagen Atlas 2017 Review](https:\/\/www.autocar.co.uk\/car-review\/volkswagen\/atlas\/first-drives\/volkswagen-atlas-2017-review)\" | *Autocar*\n- [Volkswagen Atlas Two-Row SUV -

But Volkswagen made a conscious decision to soften up the Jetta for American tastes, beyond what softening Volkswagen traditionally applied, and it seems like this philosophy scaled up to the much larger Atlas. Maybe the soft ride impresses on test drives, but a firmer setup would likely make life nicer for occupants over the long haul.\n\n#auto","views":427,"updated":"2022-04-04T08:00:51Z","tags":["dedede","auto"],"type":null,"title":"2019 Volkswagen Atlas Review","slug":"2019-volkswagen-atlas-sel-vr6-review","appearance":"norm","language":"en","rtl":false,"created":"2020-04-12T05:56:50Z","images":["https:\/\/i.snap.as\/boo7eIM.jpg","https:\/\/i.snap.as\/63zglSP.jpg","https:\/\/i.snap.as\/FI9Hd6A.jpg","https:\/\/i.snap.as\/nsYN1ax.jpg","https:\/\/i.snap.as\/YaLfPD9.jpg","https:\/\/i.snap.as\/SeRBqGI.jpg","https:\/\/i.snap.as\/XzLvAnV.jpg","https:\/\/i.snap.as\/uh6I3EF.jpg","https:\/\/i.snap.as\/ZATOFIE.jpg"],"collection":{"public":false,"alias":"bilge","total_posts":0,"title":"The Psalms","verification_link":"","description":"A <a href=\"https:\/\/davidblue.wtf\/db.vcf\">narcoleptic yokel<\/a> on software and culture.","style_sheet":"","views":177027,"monetization_pointer":""},"paid":false},{"id":"s929n5vxsfaefi3q","body":"![Submissions - Typing on Apple II](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/wlaHt16.png)\n\n*Extratone* is proud to resume accepting submitted work thanks to the magic of [Submit.as](https:\/\/submit.as\/).

Naturally - in classic medium fashion - she begins many of her sentences with \"But,\" which [I really hate](https:\/\/twitter.com\/NeoYokel\/status\/1250153204014288902).\n\n> Why spend so much time worrying about what Medium is? Maybe because we wanted to know whether it was a friend or an enemy. The answer is that it’s neither. It’s a reflection of what the media industry has worried about, and hoped for, and not received. But Medium was never something that we would get to define. Instead, it’s turned out to be an endless thought experiment into what publishing on the internet could look like. That’s not much fun for people who got burned along the way, but Medium was never exactly ours to begin with.\n\n## Other Stuff\n\n* I wrote *Extratone*'s sparse [submissions page](http:\/\/extratone.com\/submissions) today after signing us up for [Submit.as](http:\/\/submit.as).

If you only ever heed a single piece of my advice, ever, *please* make it this one. [Most password managers available](https:\/\/www.pcmag.com\/picks\/the-best-password-managers) are secure, cross-platform, optionally cloud-synced tools that help you generate, store, and organize digital credentials. More likely than not, you’re already using one in your favorite browser. On MacOS and iOS, Safari is linked to a service called Keychain, which is – functionally – a robust password manager. On signup for a given website or service, Safari should prompt you to automatically generate secure, complex passwords to store in Keychain. Generally, it’s pretty smart about knowing when it’s time to retrieve the credentials with Touch-ID, but for when it *isn’t*, you should know [how to manually retrieve passwords from Keychain](https:\/\/support.apple.com\/guide\/keychain-access\/what-is-keychain-access-kyca1083\/mac). If you’re deeply enough embedded into the Mac ecosystem, you can feel free to continue to rely on this process as long as you know how to help yourself when it fails. I’m not going to tell you who to trust, but I do *almost* actually believe in Apple’s commitment to securing user data, if only because of the way their incentives are aligned (in contrast with those in front of data-funded organizations like Google.)\n\nIf you’re using a Windows Home Machine and\/or an Android smartphone, I believe it’s more urgent that you find a standalone password management solution immediately. I use a gorgeous app called [Enpass](https:\/\/www.enpass.io\/) to store all of my passwords as well as my bank credentials, credit cards, driver’s license information, and anything else I might need to keep handy, securely. I can use virtually any cloud or file-sharing service to keep my “vaults” synced between all of my devices: Microsoft OneDrive, Google Drive, Dropbox, iCloud, Box, etc, and I also regularly create encrypted local backups just in case. I can even *share* end-to-end encrypted credentials with another device or Enpass installation. I migrated to Enpass two years ago after using [1Password](https:\/\/www.consumerreports.org\/password-managers\/best-password-managers-review-digital-security-privacy-ease-of-use\/) for nearly 10. It was intuitive and virtually seamless, as such things in software tend to be these days, and as a result, I haven’t had to memorize a single password since my adolescence. Enpass allows me to create custom login templates for quick differentiation when creating new entries as well as picturized categories and tags. With one click, even the icon can be pulled from a given URL’s favicon to help keep my vault looking visually itemized. It also includes presets for a hundred services or so – from Google to Wix to Yahoo! Japan. \n\n<div style=\"padding:66.67% 0 0 0;position:relative;\"><iframe src=\"https:\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/407790756?color=00006b&title=0&byline=0&portrait=0\" style=\"position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div><script src=\"https:\/\/player.vimeo.com\/api\/player.js\"><\/script>\n\n## Total Recall with a Clipboard Manager\n\nImagine if everything you had ever copied (as in **Ctrl-C**) were listed in linear order, [easily and instantly searchable](https:\/\/vimeo.com\/407790756) via a single global keyboard shortcut (**Alt-`**) and navigable with the arrow keys. Imagine if you could then export an archive of your clipboard so *nothing* could ever be lost. Imagine clipboard *tabs* that are easily switchable. [CopyQ](https:\/\/hluk.github.io\/CopyQ\/) – an “advanced clipboard manager” – is one of my favorite software discoveries of all time. Some workdays, I use it literally hundreds of instances in my workflow. It is difficult to describe how much more useful it makes the clipboard feature – something we’ve all been using for decades, now. For someone like me who [copies a ridiculous amount of links every day](https:\/\/extratone.com\/three-years-of-good-reads), CopyQ’s functionality has truly become *life-changing*.\n\n![Windows 10 Keyboard Shortcuts - General](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/G4JSrQb.png)\n\n## Alt-D and Other Keyboard Shortcuts\n\nSomehow, I did not discover **Alt-D** until 2018, which means that I had spent the entirety of my 24 years since *triple-clicking* to select every single URL I’d ever copied. I built a media company this way, and I can’t believe nobody told me about this shortcut. Open any given web browser, use **Alt-D**, and your selection will move to the URL in the address bar on top of the page. It’s very possible this will be of little use to you, but anyone who regularly shares or copies links will save themselves *so* much time. I felt the same way when I discovered text navigation with **Alt**, **Shift**, **Ctrl** + the arrow keys. Most of these are cross-platform, but I am specifically focusing on [Windows shortcuts](https:\/\/support.microsoft.com\/en-us\/help\/12445\/windows-keyboard-shortcuts) for this piece because that’s what I’m currently using.\n\n### Arrow key-related shortcuts \n\n·    **Shift** in conjunction with the arrow keys selects text in a document surrounding the cursor.\n\n·    **Alt** in conjunction with the arrow keys allows one to go forward or backward in a browser.\n\n·    **Ctrl** in conjunction with the arrow keys allows one to navigate text by word.\n\nVirtually all of the “Windows logo key” shortcuts are usable in day-to-day workflows. I use **Win-D** to immediately minimize all windows and show the desktop on the regular. Microsoft is [currently testing](https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2020\/4\/17\/21224904\/microsoft-windows-10-launcher-powertoy-spotlight-alfred-details) a feature like MacOS’ spotlight which is triggered with this key.\n\n> Designed to replace the existing Win + R shortcut, the new launcher will include options to quickly search apps and files across Windows and support for plugins like calculators, dictionaries, and search engines.\n\nWe can only hope this feature will be as useful as spotlight (which is triggered with **⌘-Spacebar** for you Mac users,) and will be implemented as standard as soon as possible. If you’re not already using basic shortcuts for functions like closing tabs\/windows and cut\/copy\/pasting text, I’d advise you to begin as soon as possible. It can be hard to commit, but I promise it’ll make your life better. Try printing out a list of shortcuts for your particular operating system to keep by your workspace and\/or find or create an image of the list to set as your [desktop background](http:\/\/extratone.wiki\/net\/index.php\/s\/2Pn5H32yYYrm3bG) for a while.\n\n## Learn Markdown Immediately\n\nWhile we’re on the subject of text – and hopefully without finding ourselves exploring [the entire history of word processing](https:\/\/medium.com\/redletters\/evernote-dropbox-paper-and-the-history-of-word-processing-9407b2c7afba) – I’d like to evangelize what very well might be the Ultimate Formatting Language for digital text. It’s called [Markdown](https:\/\/daringfireball.net\/projects\/markdown\/syntax), and it’s something you’ve likely already used in one form or another. Technically, Markdown is “[a text-to-HTML conversion tool for web writers](https:\/\/daringfireball.net\/projects\/markdown\/),” but – more importantly – it’s a method of stylizing text which is as simple as possible, easy to universalize, and already quite popular. While *Vice* argues that Markdown is a “[power-user tool](https:\/\/www.vice.com\/en_us\/article\/pa7nbn\/slacks-new-rich-text-editor-shows-why-markdown-still-scares-people),” I’d suggest that it’s one everybody should make use of. Though I am currently writing this in Word (for the first time in a good while,) I’m going to [pay for it later](https:\/\/slate.com\/technology\/2012\/04\/microsoft-word-is-cumbersome-inefficient-and-obsolete-its-time-for-it-to-die.html). \n\n> A Word file is the story-fax of the early 21st century: cumbersome, inefficient, and a relic of obsolete assumptions about technology.\n\n“[[Markdown\\] has all the advantages of plain text, but with the organizational power of a word processor](https:\/\/lifehacker.com\/what-is-markdown-and-why-is-it-better-for-my-to-do-lis-5943320),” says *Lifehacker*. From [Ian Lurie](https:\/\/www.portent.com\/blog\/copywriting\/use-markdown-now.htm):\n\n> I once had to convert a Word document to a web page.\n>\n> Once.\n>\n> After spending hours deleting mso-style blocks and cleaning up thousands of lines of crap, I swore (and swore, and swore) that I’d never do that again.\n>\n> So I moved to [Markdown](https:\/\/daringfireball.net\/projects\/markdown\/syntax). For a writer who publishes mostly to the web, it’s perfect.\n\nBefore I committed to writing in Markdown and moved *Extratone* to [Write.As](https:\/\/write.as\/about) – a wonderfully simple, open-source web CMS entirely based on Markdown – I really struggled with text formatting on [our old WordPress-based site](http:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20190126095147\/http:\/www.extratone.com\/), spending hours cleaning up text from Word, Apple Notes, Dropbox Paper, and Google Docs. Now, WordPress [natively supports Markdown](https:\/\/wordpress.com\/support\/can-i-use-markdown-on-wordpress-com\/) along with [Ghost](https:\/\/ghost.org\/faq\/using-markdown\/), [Slack](https:\/\/slack.com\/help\/articles\/202288908-Format-your-messages), [Discord](https:\/\/support.discordapp.com\/hc\/en-us\/articles\/210298617-Markdown-Text-101-Chat-Formatting-Bold-Italic-Underline-), [Tumblr](https:\/\/marco.org\/2008\/11\/14\/in-tumblrs-preferences-screen-you-can-specify), and more.\n\nhttps:\/\/twitter.com\/NeoYokel\/status\/1063486573197561857\n\n*Mashable* published [a formidable list](https:\/\/mashable.com\/2013\/06\/24\/markdown-tools\/) of Markdown editors in 2013, but many are since significantly out of date. Instead, I’d refer you to @awwsmm’s “[State of Markdown Editors 2019](https:\/\/dev.to\/awwsmm\/state-of-markdown-editors-2019-2k49),” which suggests [Joplin](https:\/\/joplinapp.org\/) as the winning pick. Joplin is open-source and syncs across devices using your preferred cloud service, but it requires that all notes be written in a monospace typeface, which I do not prefer. If you have a MacOS-running machine and\/or an iOS-running smartphone, you *must* download and try an application called [Bear](https:\/\/bear.app\/). It is quite simply the [most beautiful](https:\/\/twitter.com\/NeoYokel\/status\/1063486573197561857) piece of software – aesthetically and functionally – that I have ever seen, and therefore the most beautiful possible execution of a Markdown Editor. From [*The Verge*’s Dieter Bohn](https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2017\/3\/2\/14785264\/evernote-replacement-bear-app):\n\n> Bear uses a simple three-paned design. The largest column is devoted to your current note. A smaller column to the left contains your notes in reverse-chronological order, topped by a search bar. The left-most column contains notes that you’ve pinned, as well as any tags you’ve created to organize your notes — #recipes, for example. I spent years trying to sort my notes into notebooks in Evernote, only to learn that what I really needed was a faster search box.\n\n<div style=\"padding:56.25% 0 0 0;position:relative;\"><iframe src=\"https:\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/192615466?color=00006b&title=0&byline=0&portrait=0\" style=\"position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div><script src=\"https:\/\/player.vimeo.com\/api\/player.js\"><\/script>\n\nAs much as I despise the term “seamless,” everything about Bear is its definition. For someone like me, it, alone, almost warrants a reversion to MacOS. If you have the correct platforms, I *require* you to try it. Unfortunately, there can be no true Windows or Linux equivalent without the work Shiny Frog has done to streamline Bear’s near-instantaneous iCloud integration, but there is one application that can literally simulate its functionality in every other way. [Typora](https:\/\/typora.io\/) is an infinitely-customizable alternative that spans all three platforms with a well-populated [themes gallery](https:\/\/theme.typora.io\/) (including an [actual copy](https:\/\/theme.typora.io\/theme\/cobalt\/) of my favorite Bear theme.) My installation is not nearly as *smooth* as Bear, but it’s technically more powerful – bad news for users like me who can’t resist fiddling. I’ve downloaded (and attempted to author\/modify) a billion themes for Typora. Bear, by contrast, allows *just* enough stylistic modification (color theme, a choice list of 7 beautiful typefaces, and sliders for font size, line height, paragraph spacing,) without *any* access to its internal workings. In this way, it provides the perfect blend of customizability and minimalism. If you tend toward the latter, try an ultra-slim solution like WordPress’ [Simplenote](https:\/\/simplenote.com\/).\n\n![Telegram Desktop](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/ERQF0xF.png)\n\n## Telegram\n\nI ran a poll on both [Twitter](https:\/\/twitter.com\/NeoYokel\/status\/1252322233181261824) and [Mastodon](https:\/\/mastodon.social\/@DavidBlue\/104032632147081656) yesterday asking “do you still email things to yourself?” Overwhelmingly, my “audience” responded “yes,” which is awfully surprising considering their demographic – young, techish early adopters. Though email is not yet “[obsolete](https:\/\/www.inc.com\/john-brandon\/why-email-will-be-obsolete-by-2020.html)” – as envisioned by *Inc*’s John Brandon in 2015 – it has indeed been replaced by other software in many of its functions, *especially* the old Mail-to-Self practice. I cannot remember the last time I emailed myself anything – even to transfer photos from my cellular to my computer, as I used to do often. Instead, I use a private [Telegram channel](https:\/\/telegram.org\/faq_channels#q-what-39s-a-channel) to send myself photos, videos, links, text, and any other file up to 1.5GB! There’ve always been plenty of reasons to use the messaging app for general communication – especially since [Facebook acquired WhatsApp](https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2014\/02\/24\/telegram-saw-8m-downloads-after-whatsapp-got-acquired\/) in 2014. Though press coverage of the application has all but dried up, I would argue there are now [more reasons than ever](https:\/\/medium.com\/@sirajea\/11-reasons-why-you-should-use-telegram-instead-of-whatsapp-ab0f80fbfa79) to make use of Telegram in your day-to-day life.\n\n[As of 2016](https:\/\/www.wired.co.uk\/article\/episode-256), Telegram had 100 million active users, but it’s certainly experienced its [fair share of controversies](https:\/\/www.abacusnews.com\/digital-life\/why-telegram-isnt-secure-you-think\/article\/3014398). I see no reason to be worried about encryption or privacy at all, for that matter, for the vast majority of Mail-to-Self cases. If the files you’re sending yourself are sensitive enough to worry about, you shouldn’t be emailing them, anyway.\n\n## Other Stuff \n\nIf you’re the sort of person who regularly types out 500+ word text messages (or have to do homework\/any real writing) on your smartphone, I have a secret to reveal to you: **most smartphones still have Bluetooth keyboard support**. It may [look strange](https:\/\/twitter.com\/NeoYokel\/status\/1144268334353047552), but yes, you can use a full qwerty keyboard with your phone. Those of us who’ve livestreamed or used screenrecording software know that [OBS](https:\/\/obsproject.com\/) (Open Broadcaster Software) is an absolute gift from Gourd, but [these days](https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2020\/3\/31\/21201043\/streamlabs-obs-mac-streaming-twitch-mixer-facebook-youtube), it’s also easy enough for most computer users to make use of. I’d encourage everybody who can think of a reason to record their screen – to show somebody how to do something, for instance – to download and install it. Finally, I think every Windows user should look into [compacting their operating system](https:\/\/docs.microsoft.com\/en-us\/windows-hardware\/manufacture\/desktop\/compact-os) into just the essentials. “Compact OS” is really just a Windows 10 install without [bloatware](https:\/\/www.computerworld.com\/article\/2966113\/bloatware-what-it-is-and-how-to-get-rid-of-it.html): the shit you almost certainly don’t need. If you *do* find yourself in need of default Microsoft apps, you’ll be able to redownload them instantly from the Windows Store.\n\nI’d been meaning to write something like this for a very long time, so I hope you or someone you know has found it useful. I’m not an authority in the technical sense, but I’ve used every one of these suggestions in my own computing life for years, now, to great benefit.

This will also look at the past mistakes of other studies in not defining the differences in types of humor in relation to their effects on both professionals and clients. Making the distinction between lighthearted and gallows humor can change the entire meaning of a study. This thesis analyzes and explains the results from multiple studies and also explain why this field requires more research before any solid conclusions can be made.\n\n### Keywords\n\n**gallows** or **negative humor**, **secondary traumatic stress**, **lighthearted** or **positive humor**, **successful humor**\n\nMany studies have been done on humor and its uses as a coping mechanism in the workplace. The majority of these studies conclude that humor in the workplace is beneficial. Few of them differentiate between positive and negative humor, though. Because of this there is more than one answer to the question of \"is humor in the workplace good or bad?\" Professionals in career fields that involve Secondary Traumatic Stress often use forms of humor as coping mechanisms. In this essay, multiple studies that touch on the subject of humor in these types of workplaces will be analyzed. Gallows humor and negative humor will be used interchangeably, as well as lighthearted humor and positive humor and the following topics will be addressed:\n\n1. Explaining Secondary Traumatic Stress\n2. The distinction between lighthearted, gallows, and successful humor\n3. Positive effects of humor in the workplace\n4. Negative effects of humor in the workplace\n5. Effects of humor on clients\n6. Alternate coping mechanisms\n7. Further research\n\nThrough analyzing these topics, it can be concluded that, while successful humor can be a very good coping skill in stressful work environments, gallows humor is not and has even been linked to negative effects on the individual’s physical and psychological wellbeing.\n\n## What is Secondary Traumatic Stress?\n\nProfessionals who often deal with traumatic events experience a lot of stress. This type of stress, when it is severe, is referred to as Secondary Traumatic Stress. Secondary Traumatic Stress is defined [in the *Psychiatric Times*](https:\/\/www.psychiatrictimes.com\/ptsd\/secondary-traumatization-mental-health-care-providers\/page\/0\/1) as, \"indirect exposure to trauma through a firsthand account or narrative of a traumatic event.\" This means that individuals who assist others during traumatic events or hear recounts of traumatic events run the risk of developing Secondary Traumatic Stress Syndrome. The symptoms of Secondary Traumatic Stress, or STS, are [similar to the symptoms of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder](https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/26301442) which occurs in individuals who experience trauma first-hand. Professionals who deal with these kinds of issues include, but are not limited to: police officers, forensic nurses, firefighters, crime scene investigators, surgeons, therapists, and sex crime workers. In these professions, humor is often used to combat this stress or serve as a coping mechanism. The humor used as a coping mechanism in these careers can often be macabre due to the [austere nature of their jobs](https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/9131354). These professionals experience, secondhand, everything from serious injuries, to death, to the aftermath of sexual assaults and much more. These are not experiences that the average person goes through on a day to day basis. Because of this, it does take a toll on these professionals. This secondhand, or indirect, exposure to trauma can have huge emotional impacts on individuals and many believe humor can be used to combat this. In a study done on 133 human service professionals, ranging in age from 20 to 64, it was found that age, sex, and relationship status [did not have much effect on Secondary Traumatic Stress levels](https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/27286075). This means that anyone can be susceptible to developing Secondary Traumatic Stress in these career fields. \n\n## Different Types of Humor\n\nIn most contexts, humor is considered a positive aspect of communication while [the darker side goes unmentioned](https:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/abs\/10.1080\/10538712.2014.949395). While humor can be used both in and outside of the workplace to lift spirits, this is not its only use. Humor was seen as an important staff skill by individuals involved in a study on Forensic Nurses, though timing and type were [never clarified in the research that was analyzed](https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24847873). Humor can be intended for and perceived in many different ways. Humor can be seen as aggressive, rude, or sarcastic when at the expense of others. When used positively though, humor can be lighthearted and fun. It can also be used to express emotions like anger, frustration, and joy. While defining humor, Boes and Wormer point out that Freud thought of humor as \"a coping mechanism that allows society to reduce tension by expressing… obscene impulses in a socially acceptable manner.\" This statement implies that at one time gallows humor was believed to be tension-relieving and positive. Gallows humor refers to the dark sense of humor some develop while working in high stress career fields. It can be defined as \"humor that makes fun of a life-threatening, disastrous, or terrifying situations.\" It is often used only amongst certain groups of workers because others are seen as \"outsiders\" who [would not understand their sense of humor](https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/21980898). Craun and Bourke also touch on this, stating that professionals who all work with sudden traumatic deaths feel comfortable using gallows humor amongst themselves but know better than to use it with other workers, such as those involved in clerical work. Because of this, the group that uses gallows humor knows to censor themselves around \"outsiders.\" Successful humor is [defined as a mutually amusing communication](https:\/\/www.emerald.com\/insight\/content\/doi\/10.1108\/02683941211199554\/full\/html). Both gallows and lighthearted humor can fall into this category depending on the situation but just because humor is successful does not mean it is positive.\n\n## When is Humor Good in Regards to Secondary Traumatic Stress?\n\nHaving a good sense of humor has long been seen as something that decreases depression, anxiety, and stress while increasing immunity to illness and enhancing moods. Positive humor can illicit positive responses, therefore having the potential to improve group processes in the workplace. Mesmer-Magnus, Glew, and Viswesvaran come to the conclusion in their meta-analysis that positive humor can build affinity, reduce burnout, increase workplace cohesion, and enhance coping effectiveness. Through analyzing the results of prior research, they were able to deduce that lighthearted humor was able to increase job performance and satisfaction, as well as, save money that would usually have been spent as a side-effect of employees being burned out. It can also be said from their research that positive humor in the workplace can be linked to better overall physical and mental health. So, it can be said that positive and lighthearted humor do correlate with positive effects. In Craun and Bourke’s qualitative study of 500 sex crime workers, they were able to show that lighthearted humor was used frequently by the Internet Crimes Against Children members through the use of several surveys. The use of lighthearted humor correlated with lower Secondary Traumatic Test scores and had more effect on the scores than social and coworker support.\n\nA type of humor that usually has a positive impact on workers is \"play on words\" humor. Play on words humor can be considered as a type of lighthearted humor. In a study done on humor used in the emergency room, this type of humor was discussed. This kind of humor can be purposeful, or it can come from a Freudian slip. An example given by Wormer and Boes is of a doctor accidentally saying, \"Just eat 'em and street 'em\" rather than \"Just treat 'em and street 'em.\" Another example given was of a nickname made for a surgeon who often wore cowboy boots and was \"very aggressive\" during his procedures. It was always said out of his ear shot, but his staff called him the \"cowboy surgeon.\" This kind of humor is harmless and facilitates a sense of community amongst the coworkers in the emergency room. \n\nTension relieving nonsense was another form of lighthearted humor discussed in Wormer and Boes’ analysis of humor in the emergency room. They called it tension relieving nonsense because this kind of silly humor often results in laughter. Laughing can help relax muscles, relieve tightness, and aid in creating a sense of well-being. Wormer and Boes pass on a story told by a nurse administrator, named Alice Guy, that encompasses tension relieving humor, stating: \n\nHospital staff members were having a party when word came that a patient was on the roof threatening suicide. Guy was furious at this threat to their fun. Rushing to the roof and speaking without thinking, she ordered, 'Get off that roof! You're interrupting the party.’ The man did. The humor of the story was that despite the fact that others had tried for hours to get the man off the roof, he obeyed the one person who simply spoke her mind – and in doing so went beyond the bounds of good professionalism. This amusing story was shared at the hospital for years after.\n\nThere are many positive ways to use humor as a coping mechanism, but this does not mean that all ways of using humor for coping are good. \n\n## The Use of Gallows Humor\n\nIn their meta-analysis, Boes and Wormer suggest that gallows humor is a way of maintaining sanity in insane conditions; that it is an illogical response to a hopeless situation. This is where the research begins to clash, because while this may be partially true, others believe the results of Craun and Bourke’s study help clarify that even if gallows humor gives you a sense of relief, it is only temporary because in the long run the effects of its use are not positive. Boes and Wormer gave an example of an inmate on death row jokingly turning down a cigarette because he had quit the prior day. This is an example of gallows humor because, generally speaking, people stop smoking for health reasons. They do not want to get cancer, emphysema, or they want to live to see their grandchildren, etc. Because this inmate is on death row though, none of these things apply to them so the inmate is seen as using gallows humor to make light of the fact he may not be alive much longer. Another example they give is about an inmate on death row asking about when they are going to start a weight watchers program. Again, this is gallows humor because realistically, this person will not be alive very long, so their weight is not an actual concern. The humor is just being used as a coping mechanism to make light of the fact the inmate is on death row. \n\nWatson has a similar concept of gallows humor as Freud. Watson is quoted in her qualitative research on gallows humor in the medical field saying, \"blanket dismissals of gallows humor as unprofessional misunderstand or undervalue the psychological, social, cognitive, and linguistic ways that joking and laughing work.\" [Another source](https:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/abs\/10.1080\/15325024.2010.507661) states that laughter can be used to help interrupt physiological stress responses because it increases exhalation and it eases muscle tension. Humor though, can exist as a separate entity than laughter and therefore does not correlate. Not to mention that in Craun and Bourke’s study, they found that the use of gallows humor correlated with higher Secondary Traumatic Stress scores and even had a higher effect on the scores than using denial as a coping skill did. Gallows humor was also linked to an [increase in alcohol consumption in participants in the past year and reduced psychological wellness](https:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/abs\/10.1080\/10538712.2014.949395). Craun and Bourke point out previous studies imply that the use of gallows humor may be an indication of psychological distress in workers. These studies show that use and increasing use of gallows humor is an indicator that the professional is no longer compassionate enough to fulfil their job properly, as well as, the possibility that it is a red flag indicating that the individual is not coping with Secondary Traumatic Stress well. \n\nSome researchers believe that using gallows humor as a coping mechanism is not a big deal. They believe that professionals in career fields where Secondary Traumatic Stress is experience should use whatever methods necessary to cope. One of these studies makes the claim that \"The use of black humor among emergency services professionals would thus be seen as a form of stress release, relieving the professional of intolerable feelings of horror, helplessness, and anger, and this in turn would reduce psychic anxiety.\" They also acknowledge, though, that using this kind of humor to cope could end up with adverse effects such as increasing anger. They use the old concept of superiority theory to support these claims. Superiority theory states that using humor at the expense of others helps raise our self-esteem and by blaming victims for the unfortunate things that happen to them. Individuals can convince themselves they would never be in a position to experience the same misfortune. In their examination, they use a quote from Wear and Colleagues to support their stance, citing \"students enter the clinical world full of enthusiasm and optimism for what medicine can achieve and are met with obstacles of all sorts, including cynical faculty, uncooperative or unappreciative patients, and their own unanticipated emotional responses to the experience of hospital based medicine. Every day they encounter something that should be otherwise, and humor may be one way of managing the incongruencies.\" While it can be seen that humor is important in the workplace as way of managing the day to day events, once again, this quote from this study does not point out what kind of humor they are discussing. The study itself may go into further detail, but what is provided in the examination by Regehr and Rowe does not. \n\n## Effects on Work Relationships and Clients\n\nHumor can be used as a tool to bond with people. In the study on forensic nurses, they focused a part of their research on humor as a relational tool. They specified this as the use of humor with patients. The results were split, a good portion of the nurses said they believed humor helped with their patient relations while others stated that the use of humor in general was challenging the institutional order. They also stated that even the most well intended jokes can be misunderstood and taken the wrong way and that this possibility might make it less worth it to employ humor with patients, but correct use of humor could lead to a more relaxed patient. In another study of nurses, it was indicated that [those who were experiencing Secondary Traumatic Stress were more likely to be impersonal or angry with patients](https:\/\/www.researchgate.net\/publication\/320647022_Exploration_of_the_Association_between_Nurses'_Moral_Distress_and_Secondary_Traumatic_Stress_Syndrome_Implications_for_Patient_Safety_in_Mental_Health_Services) therefore reducing the quality of the patient and care taker interaction as well as colleague to colleague relationships. Another source reported acknowledging that using gallows humor with patients could dehumanize those who the jokes are about.\n\nThis open-ended result on the effects of humor on patients is just one of the many reasons more research needs to be done in this field. When patients use gallows humor, it is often seen as giving themselves power in a situation they are otherwise powerless in. While this is definitely one way to explain this phenomenon, it is possible that this could be interpreted in another way. The use of gallows humor as a coping mechanism may be a way of deflecting, preventing full acknowledgment of their emotional state. This room for interpretation is another reason why more research needs to be done in this field that distinguishes between lighthearted and gallows humor. \n\n## Alternative Coping Skills\n\nOne study that does look into alternative ways for workers to deal with Secondary Traumatic Stress suggests using resilience and mindfulness as an alternative coping mechanism. This study defines resilience as a \"buffer which protects individuals from adverse environmental influences and forces\" and \"the ability to bounce back from adversity, persevere through difficult times, and return to a state of internal equilibrium.\" The other suggestion is mindfulness. Mindfulness is defined in their research as \"an intentional state of awareness, mindfulness concerns the process of bringing one’s attention to the present moment, in a non-judgmental and accepting manner.\" Mindfulness is very effective in reducing stress and increasing what Harker, Pidgeon, Klaassen, and King referred to as resilience. Unlike resilience though, mindfulness has an explanation as to how to reach it. Mindfulness can be practiced through multiple techniques which range from quietly meditating to playing active games and are generally done in 5-minute increments in therapeutic settings but can be done for as long as the individual or group needs outside of the therapeutic setting. Increased mindfulness was linked with an increase of psychological well-being and with a decrease in Secondary Traumatic Stress scores. They also found that \"research investigating the beneficial effects of increased levels of mindfulness has reported improvements in distress tolerance, emotion regulation skills, and psychological flexibility. In order to conduct their study, they sampled a group of 133 human service professionals – mostly women – and gave them a series of questionnaires. The questionnaires they used were *The Professional Quality of Life Scale*, *The General Well-Being Schedule*, *The Resilience Factor Inventory*, and *The Freiburg Mindfulness Inventory*. The Quality of Life Scale has two subscales: one the measures exhaustion, frustration, anger, and depression symptoms and the other measures negative feelings brought on by work-related trauma and fear. Anxiety and depressive symptoms are assessed using the General Well-Being Schedule, along with overall psychological well-being. The Resilience Factor Inventory evaluates the individual’s level of resilience with 60 questions and The Freiburg Mindfulness Inventory evaluates the individual’s mindfulness using 14 questions. \n\nThe conclusions that these tests came to were that higher levels of resilience and mindfulness correlated with lower levels of Secondary Traumatic Stress. Mindfulness showed less effect on the levels while resilience showed much more. Mindfulness only made up for 1.77% of the variance and resilience made up 8.18% of the variance. The researchers did point out at the end, though, that the study was completely voluntary and therefore may have had skewed data. The way they framed the concern was that the employees who were experiencing the most Secondary Traumatic Stress may have been too emotionally fatigued to participate in the study and that this may have skewed the data. On top of this, they pointed out that self-report data can be unreliable due to the fact that people often show social desirability biases. \n\nBecause the symptoms of Secondary Traumatic Stress are so similar to the symptoms of Post Traumatic Stress, it could be said that treatments geared for PTSD may be effective in treating STS. One of these treatment paths are Cognitive Behavioral Therapies. \"[Cognitive behavioral therapies (CBTs) challenge the way individuals think and behave and are an effective intervention for treatment of PTSD](https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC4211431\/).\" One type of CBT is CPT, or Cognitive Processing Therapy. This is a therapy that was originally developed to treat rape victims. In CPT, the traumatic event is revisited in order to facilitate reshaping the negative world views created by the traumatic event. An example given is of someone being raped and developing a view that the world is not safe. In order to combat this the therapist would assist in changing this view from \"the world isn’t safe\" to \"I can learn to protect myself in an unsafe world.\" By doing this, the therapist can help lower the distress levels of the patient, as well as avoidance, which is a component of PTSD. CBT involves homework for patients as well to help generalize the skills being taught within the clinical setting. \n\nAnother treatment often used for PTSD is Prolonged Exposure Therapy. This is a behavioral therapy that \"helps clients safely face frightening experiences and memories by recalling traumatic memories in a controlled fashion.\" This process is done gradually in a controlled setting so as to not overwhelm the patient. It is believed that this process can help the patient assess their symptoms and reshape their feelings and thoughts about the event that caused them to develop PTSD. It can also help the patient to slowly begin regular functioning on a day to day basis. \n\nPsychotropic medication can also be beneficial for PTSD patients. Some anti-depressants can help reduce the levels of depression, stemming from the traumatic event, in patients. There are many anti-depressants that are approved by the FDA to assist with PTSD symptoms. Anxiolytics, or antianxiety and antipanic medications, can be used to reduce stress and anxiety levels in individuals who have PTSD according to the Mayo Clinic. There are also medications such as Prazosin, an antihypertensive medication, that is not approved to treat PTSD by the FDA, but the Mayo Clinic believes could help keep nightmares at bay and combat insomnia. \n\nEye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing, otherwise known as EMDR, is evidence based when it comes to its effectiveness in treating Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. EMDR is a mixture of psychodynamic, behavioral, cognitive, and body-centered therapies. During this treatment, the therapist will use what is called \"bilateral stimulation.\" This means the client will work to process the traumatic event while the therapist uses \"eye movements following hand, tactile or auditory cues.\" During this process, the client goes back and forth between thinking of the traumatic event and focusing on the present moment. This is called \"dual attention.\" \n\n## Further Research\n\nWhile it is true that research has identified positive links between humor and emotional states, very few people have made the distinction between lighthearted and gallows humor. Because of this, studies that primarily focus on positive humor are often used to justify gallows humor in the workplace as well because the distinction was never made between positive and negative humor. The connection Watson makes between gallows humor and laughter earlier in the paper is an example of this, as well as Boes’ and Wormer’s interpretation of what using gallows humor as a patient indicates. The misconception that all humor is connected with laughing and therefore positive is just that, a misconception. This flaw in humor studies means that there is still a significant amount of research needing to be done in this area. Studies should be done to clearly determine what the effects of positive and negative humor are separately. Studies need to be done on professional-client relationships and the use of gallows humor. These studies should focus on groups where only the professional uses gallows, only the patient uses gallows, both use gallows, and then neither use gallows. It may be very difficult to find these relationships naturally but if it could be done, it could be said that this would be a very effective way of gathering data on these types of social relationships. It can also be said that it would be beneficial for professionals who use gallows humor to be evaluated individually to see if there is a correlation with things such as depression and anxiety and the use of gallows humor because very few studies do. Another aspect that would be good to look into is whether or not there is a difference in the effects based on sex and gender. Although one of the studies previously discussed sex alone, the study was almost 80% women and therefore could be biased. Even though many do not believe there are many physiological differences between men and women, the ways life is experienced in our patriarchal society may possibly leave one sex or gender more vulnerable to Secondary Traumatic Stress. In order to get past the self-report data bias, assessments in the future could be conducted using a psychiatrist or other assessment specific professional to administer the questionnaires in a format closer to how mental illnesses are assessed. A lot of these studies focused on correlation. This is an important factor, but future research should focus more on causation and include more factors that could be affecting the results of the experiments. Another beneficial thing to look into would be if certain therapies that show success with PTSD would show the same level of success with individuals experiencing Secondary Traumatic Stress. Because PTSD and Secondary Traumatic Stress have very similar symptoms, it is likely that there is some overlap when it comes to coping and treatment after the fact. \n\nWhile many studies conclude that humor in the workplace is positive, it can be seen from analyzing research that distinguishes between types of humor that gallows humor is not a healthy coping mechanism. In some cases, it can be an indicator that workers are no longer compassionate enough to work in their field and others that the worker is not managing their Secondary Traumatic Stress well. There is not a lot of research into alternative coping mechanisms to replace gallows humor, but it is possible that treatments and skills related to dealing with Post Traumatic Stress could be beneficial for people experiencing STS due to the fact that PTSD and STS share a lot of the same symptoms. This cannot be said with certainty though because there have not been many studies done on this. Mindfulness and resilience were shown to be helpful in handling STS though, and this is a step in the right direction to help professionals who experience indirect trauma on a fairly regular basis. It is important to further this research because a lot of these careers are necessary and helpful to the population even though they have adverse effects on the individuals doing the jobs. \n\nIn order to stress the importance of the researching more into the effects, gallows humor has in these professionals, it may be beneficial to explain why it is important to care for the mental health of these workers. Some helping fields get a lot of attention from the public and are more valued because of it, such as firefighters, surgeons, and police officers. If it could be explained why mental health workers are so important or why nurses and sex crime workers are so important, it may bring people’s awareness to them and the issues they face from working such stressful jobs. Many people don’t think about how much of a toll being in helping field takes on you but without these professionals so many people would go uncared for and untreated. Many of these workers are behind the scenes doing jobs most people would not want to do and risking their own physical and psychological well-being for others, and they deserve to have concrete answers as to how they can help protect themselves from the side effects of their jobs.\n\n🗎 [**Print\/PDF**](https:\/\/github.com\/extratone\/extratone\/raw\/main\/archive\/gallows-humor.pdf)\n\n#culture","views":4328,"updated":"2021-12-22T23:00:43Z","tags":["culture"],"type":null,"title":"Gallows Humor and Secondary Traumatic Stress in The Workplace","slug":"gallows-humor-secondary-traumatic-stress-workplace","appearance":"norm","language":"en","rtl":false,"created":"2020-04-26T03:33:37Z","images":["https:\/\/i.snap.as\/sQ2V1X2.png"],"collection":{"public":false,"alias":"extratone","total_posts":0,"title":"Extratone","verification_link":"","description":"For the New Curious.","style_sheet":"","views":182661,"monetization_pointer":""},"paid":false},{"id":"73isyqbya8mtn057","body":"![Kaweco Skyline Sport](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/1hE6Pm3.jpg)\n\n<!--more-->\n\nIt’s very pretentious to talk about pens, I agree, but I believe there’s a level of pen pretentiousness which is worth sharing with the writing masses. I continually encounter people in both personal and professional settings using - and [often worshipping](https:\/\/theoutline.com\/post\/875\/bic-cristal-pen-gold-standard) - very shitty pens. I'm not going to pretend spending $15 on a pen has not become a novel or ridiculous idea in contemporary culture, but if you're willing, this is one of those areas where some retrospective can lead to real pleasantnesss. Here are some of the tools I've owned. (I'll be linking heavily to *The Pen Addict* in this post. It's all we've got. Sorry.)\n\n![Parker Jotter](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/r73oOXr.jpg)\n\n## Parker Jotter\n\nI believe everyone on Earth should own a [Parker Jotter](http:\/\/www.officedepot.com\/a\/products\/9114371\/Parker-Jotter-Gel-Pen-Medium-Point\/). It's a slim, small ballpoint designed for sketching with a clicking action that just about everyone loves. I have owned and lost many and I will continue to for the rest of my writing life. I cannot even begin to communicate how worth it $16.99 is to never write with another disposable ballpoint ever again. They're tough, light, and beautiful. Sarah Read for [*The Pen Addict*](https:\/\/www.penaddict.com\/blog\/2017\/7\/6\/parker-jotter-ballpoint-pen-review):\n\n> If you're primarily a fountain pen user, but you acknowledge the occasional need for a ballpoint, this really is the perfect one. It looks and feels like you're spoiling yourself, but the price is low enough that you'll still have to add a fountain pen to your cart to get free shipping.\n\n![Pilot Metropolitan](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/9JgGeqU.jpg)\n\n## Pilot Metropolitan\n\nThe [Pilot Metropolitan](https:\/\/www.gouletpens.com\/collections\/pilot-metropolitan-fountain-pens\/products\/pilot-metropolitan-fountain-pen-silver-dots) has been *the* entry-level fountain pen for all of time as far as I know. Google for reviews and you'll find praises across the blog spectrum - from [*Little Coffee Fox*](https:\/\/littlecoffeefox.com\/pilot-metropolitan-review) to [*Writing For Pain and Pleasure*](https:\/\/writingforpainandpleasure.com\/2018\/04\/19\/is-there-anything-new-to-say-about-the-pilot-metropolitan) to [*The Gentleman Stationer*](https:\/\/www.gentlemanstationer.com\/blog\/2014\/10\/31\/one-week-with-the-pilot-metropolitan). \"I'm not sure there is anything on the market that even approaches a pen of this quality for $15.00,\" says the latter. Testimony from the first:\n\n> I love how the Pilot Metropolitan feels in my hand. The brass body is cold and weighty while you write without becoming a burden to use.

Though I liked being *seen* with the Safari more than the Metropolitan, and its writing experience is more conventional in terms of what to expect from other composite fountain pens, I still think the Metropolitan is more fun to use. Instead of reading what I have to say, though, check out the only words about any of these pens I spied in a major publication. For [*The Strategist*](https:\/\/nymag.com\/strategist\/article\/lamy-safari-fountain-pen-review.html), David Notis writes:\n\n> Fountain pens can be complicated and intimidating, but the Safari was designed to be approachable. (It was apparently [originally meant](https:\/\/www.penheaven.co.uk\/blog\/success-story-lamy-safari-fountain-pen\/) to help teach proper handwriting to schoolchildren).

Can you go more into that?**\n\nI started an online magazine four years ago originally on WordPress. I thought I knew something about web development, but honestly I did not. It ended up becoming a fixation on trying to make something *technically* different from what I'd seen done with WordPress, which detracted heavily from my Editorial duties over the years. I'm on the OCD spectrum so I just couldn't let it go. I spent thousands of hours fiddling with different themes and formatting within those themes, and what I ended up with was a mess. I would make changes that would break old posts, so I'd go back and fix those, only to make more changes days\/weeks\/months later and have to go back again. I'd known vaguely about Markdown, but it wasn't until it was mentioned in the WordPress dev Slack that I really considered it seriously as a way out of what I'd been doing. I realized that its inherit limitations were actually very good for me - that I needed a limited system to constrain my workflow to keep myself on task. Finally, in late-2018, I started to convert our old content to Markdown and essentially haven't looked back since.\n\n**Did it take a while for you to accept Markdown's limitations? Was there a turning point for you? Did you look for a Markdown plugin on WordPress to help after making the change? I imagine there's something like that out there.**\n\nThere are third-party plugins, yes, but I believe the new WordPress editor now supports \"[markdown blocks](https:\/\/wordpress.com\/support\/wordpress-editor\/blocks\/markdown-block\/),\" which is sortof handy for those who want to continue in that direction. The turning point was probably when we ran out of money and lost our account with our hosting provider. I was left with an old external HD full of old backups and an empty domain. I'd already started moving that direction within WordPress (largely because of the [Gutenberg editor project](https:\/\/wptavern.com\/wordpress-core-editor-team-publishes-ui-prototype-for-gutenberg-an-experimental-block-based-editor),) but losing the site in its entirety was what I really needed to push us into a more modern, progressive CMS. Honestly, Markdown is capable of everything we *actually* need and nothing more. I'd like to think I was able to realize this from the beginning.\n\n**So you're left with an old external HD full of old backups and an empty domain. Talk to me about the process then of finding that modern, progressive CMS. Did you have a vague idea of what you were looking for? I imagine getting those backups ready for whatever you were going to choose as another process entirely.**\n\nI actually decided to ditch the backups and just move forward with a different Editorial direction (the project has since been more or less put on hiatus.) I knew Markdown had to be involved and that I never wanted to look at anything like WordPress' dashboard ever again. I played around with a local Ghost instance but just didn't *feel* anything for it, if that makes sense. I'd already moved my [personal blog](http:\/\/bilge.world) to Write.As months before and eventually realized that it was just what [*Extratone*](http:\/\/extratone) needed - so far, I've only imported my own contributions and the most recent work from others.\n\n**Could you explain what you mean by *feeling* something for a piece of software? I noticed this in your [recent post](https:\/\/bilge.world\/poweruser-tips-software-shortcuts) on your personal blog and what I enjoyed about it so much. There's an enthusiasm about the software you do recommend that jumps through the screen. I want to use [Bear](https:\/\/bear.app\/) after reading your post.**\n\nI'm glad to hear that! I suppose it dates back to my upbringing on a farm in rural Missouri, where I felt a real affection for - and attachment to - our tractors, combine, and such. When one cares about their work, I think it's inevitable for them to be emotionally invested in the tools they use to accomplish it every day. During my brief stint in IT in the beginning of 2019, I saw a lot of users struggling with outdated and ridiculously unintuitive software throughout their entire workday and it made me really appreciate the idea of \"good workflow.\" I'm not really a developer, but I believe software can always be better because I've seen it. As an End User of sorts with not much cash, I feel like my main contribution back to developers should be celebrating their good work. This is an idea I feel I do not encounter enough in day-to-day life.\n\n**As someone who also had a brief stint in IT, I totally agree with the struggles people go through because of outdated & unintuitive software. But IT also made me realize how much of software is personal — someone will want a solution that's unintuitive to you but is intuitive to them. You learn a lot of empathy from that.**\n\n**I am intrigued by your last point there — why don't you think you encounter the idea of celebrating software developers enough in day-to-day life?**\n\nI suppose specifically I mean I don't see enough celebration of *good* development. It's hard to challenge the personal workflow of anyone, yes, but I hope folks will continue to want to better their lives with new solutions. As I mentioned in my Tips post, Microsoft Word is a great specific example of software that simply [*should not* be used anymore](https:\/\/slate.com\/technology\/2012\/04\/microsoft-word-is-cumbersome-inefficient-and-obsolete-its-time-for-it-to-die.html) - especially in composition for The Web. Not that Word is *celebrated*, necessarily, but **its alternatives are not**. It should be noted that I have no specific authority in this matter other than years of experience with - and enjoyment of - playing around with software. I just think that End Users deserve better than they get, and awareness of new\/different software is a huge part of the problem. Making average people aware of better solutions should be the primary function of special interest tech journalism, IMO. \n\n**Great point about Microsoft Word. I don't even remember the last time I seriously used it — high school maybe? And like you said, discovery can be an issue to the adoption of these alternative tools. So are there any common patterns you've noticed as to how you've come about these software alternatives that you now use? Patterns that someone could adopt?**\n\nIt's not that I slave away, but it does take a lot of time to discover them. The simple answer is: I drink a lot of caffeine and hyperfixate on the internet. I'm not sure it's something the average user should *want* to adopt, but if they do, they should be [on Mastodon](http:\/\/joinmastodon.org). They should be googling \"alternatives to...\" regularly, and they should worship Free and Open Source Software. Accepting that you never have to settle for one piece of software is probably the beginning. For lack of a better term, I just love *playing around* with software. That's not something I would advocate for my old clients or other End Users - I would rather find out myself and then present a list of alternatives in an entertaining way. I hope that's an appropriate and sufficient answer hehe.\n\n**No that's great! The acceptance of never having to settle for one piece of software is at once valuable and challenging to adopt. If you keep switching you could be a sort of software vagabond who throws their data into a rucksack to head to the next viable platform. I've always had trouble trying to find the proper balance between playing around with software & learning a tool well enough that it can be useful. How have you personally navigated that? I could imagine your foray into & out of Wordpress as an example.**\n\nIt's always a challenge when trying new things. I obsess over different ways to accomplish tasks. I've probably signed *Extratone* for 15 different newsletter services (including [Buttondown](http:\/\/buttondown.email) today) though I haven't actually written a single edition of our newsletter in nearly two years. I think it's only recently that I've been able to look at these habits from a reasonable perspective. As in, I am now able to finally differentiate between playing and being productive, but it took some 15 years. Self-awareness of one's actual progress is key. Asking questions like *why am I actually doing this - for profit or for play?* Differentiating between these two is something someone like me will always struggle with, I think.\n\n**The distinction between playing and being productive can be quite blurry. I sometimes find that playing around with a piece of software can lead to a productive use of it. How about you? Did you start with the idea of creating *Extratone* first and then tried to find the right software to fit the job? Or did you start playing around with Wordpress and then the idea of the digital publication took form soon after?**\n\nThat's an insightful supposition. I actually tried to launch an online magazine before *Extratone* with virtually zero editorial focus along with a standalone podcast that I'd been hosting on WordPress for years. I originally began playing around with WordPress sites in my early adolescence, so you could say it all culminated in the idea. It took maturity to realize that I actually wanted to build a platform for *other* voices rather than continue to invest in my own. I'd like to believe that was all enabled by the playing hehe.\n\n**So what lead you to the conclusion of building a platform for other voices? Especially curious from the *maturity* angle. Because you still have a [personal blog](https:\/\/bilge.world\/), so it doesn't feel like you've completely neglected your personal voice. But would you consider that as not the same investment of time & effort that you'd put into something like *Extratone*?**\n\nI should be clear that I have *not* accomplished what I set out to do with *Extratone*. After a fairly big personal trauma in 2015, I had a bit of an existential crisis and realized that I had surrounded myself with so many talented (in a particularly relevant way) online friends who were producing all sorts of incredible content - music and videos, mostly. I realized that I was better at editing and other platform duties than I was at writing, and that perhaps the online communities I was astride could be provided a single banner to give themselves. In that sense, I haven't figured out how to do what I set out to yet. Ideally, my byline would be completely gone from *Extratone*, so I've more or less put it on hold until I figure out how to accomplish that. Turning it into a somewhat profitable media company is still my biggest long-term life goal.\n\n**The curatorial characteristic you describe is underrated, even though the \"everyone is a curator\" idea is jammed down our throats all the time. There's something about this curation on a person-to-person level that still has lots of room for experimentation. On that subject, do you have any examples of communities, sites, or models that guide where you'd want *Extratone* to go?**\n\nMy citable aspirations in that regard have been somewhat superficial, I'm afraid. From a technical perspective, I really admired what Joshua Topolsky was [trying to do](https:\/\/www.niemanlab.org\/2016\/08\/newsonomics-sketching-in-the-details-of-josh-topolskys-new-outline\/) with [*The Outline*](http:\/\/theoutline.com) - which just [closed this month](https:\/\/www.niemanlab.org\/2020\/04\/the-outline-an-attempt-to-build-a-bolder-kind-of-news-site-appears-to-have-met-its-end\/), actually. They built their own CMS including a bespoke advertising delivery platform which really looked *great* but they just [couldn't figure out](https:\/\/www.niemanlab.org\/2018\/10\/the-outline-built-itself-on-being-weird-but-is-it-weird-enough-to-survive\/) a sustainable editorial focus. In my fantasy world, I have the connections and digital media insight of Topolsky and know how to apply them in a way that supports *our* community because I don't see any one brand popping up any substantial umbrellas over the electronic musicians I know. (It wasn't until \"too late\" that I realized *Extratone*'s sole editorial focus should have been electronic music all along.) I read a lot about media but I'm pretty picky as far as hero worship goes when it comes to my own professional goals. I once promised that *Extratone* would *never* run ads, so I could see some sort of non-profit classification working out in our future. I believe I could be an excellent curator - I'm just not quite sure how to get there yet.\n\n**I think you're a great curator — had to ask that question of influence because I think you have a unique curatorial presence on the web. Just saw you tweet about [tractordata.com](https:\/\/www.tractordata.com\/). Who else would recommend that? Love it. That's why I thought [Are.na](https:\/\/are.na\/) would be right up your alley.**\n\n**So you emphasized \"*our* community\" there — what do you define as your community in that broader context?**\n\nWell thank you! That's a question I'm still struggling to define. **Electronic music** is about as far as I've gotten. I met most of my talented friends on Twitter over the past 10 years or so and have tried to contain them in a [list](https:\/\/twitter.com\/i\/lists\/1032269790616858625) before. There are innate challenges in defining such a creative community - I have done my best to label without being constricting, but it's definitely difficult trying to figure out how to provide a flag which everyone feels comfortable flying. I still think the best I've done to articulate what I'm trying to say was for [*Extratone*'s About page](https:\/\/extratone.com\/about). Most of the folks I'm talking about are used to hustling their own brand so it's been a real challenge working on the right way to reach out.\n\n**A flag which everyone feels comfortable flying — that's a great way to put it. What I find interesting about your internet presence is that you defy the idea of flying just a single flag. Along with *Extratone* you have [multiple](https:\/\/anchor.fm\/extratone) [podcasts](https:\/\/anchor.fm\/davidblue), [multiple](https:\/\/bilge.world\/) [blogs](https:\/\/dieselgoth.com\/), and now you're starting a [Motorsports & Tech dedicated Mastodon instance](https:\/\/mstd.racing\/).**\n\n**I've been thinking a lot lately about how important it is to have many online buckets to put your ideas in. One just feels too limiting, especially if it's solely linked to your legal identity. How do you think about this matter of identity & expression with your own online presence?**\n\nThat's a very good question. I can't take credit for [mastd.racing](https:\/\/mastd.racing), actually - I'm not sure who created that server but it's administered by an account called [RaceControl](https:\/\/mastd.racing\/@RaceControl). You've arrived at another one of my biggest challenges. Consolidating my interests has always been a problem, especially on The Web. Age has definitely helped narrow them down a bit, but I still can't help myself sometimes. I think it's ended up alienating a lot of my followers on social because I have a hard time posting just within my niche(s). I'm not so sure how to feel about this, honestly. One could argue that I should post whatever I want, whenever, but *consider your audience* is also a concept I can no longer ignore. If anything, I need to learn to let myself be limited a bit *more* by those buckets. Once again, *Extratone* is a good example of this - I should've never published app reviews there, but I did. We're all learning, I suppose.\n\n**Do you feel like you have to even learn to limit yourself on your [personal blog](https:\/\/bilge.world\/)? It seems like a personal blog can act as the release valve — a way of getting around cornering yourself into the niches that *Extratone* and other projects require. You can freely write about [pens](https:\/\/bilge.world\/preferred-writing-instruments) and [Picard](https:\/\/bilge.world\/star-trek-picard-review) without feeling constrained to a single subject.**\n\nI think I'm just now coming around to understanding personal blogging and the freedom that entails. It's been a long while since I've had the urge to write about things on which I don't consider myself at least somewhat of an authority. I think - like many people - I originally just used my personal blog as a guinea pig for messing around with themes, and I'm just now actually catching up on some of the lesser items on my \"to-write\" list. Since we've begun talking I've begun building my blogs bookmark folder back up and following the [#100DaystoOffload](https:\/\/100daystooffload.com\/) challenge, which I find immensely impressive. I can't say I'm quite up to it, personally, but I definitely plan on opening up the taps a bit more. (I also don't want to flood [read.write.as](https:\/\/read.write.as\/) with too many joke posts ya know hehe.)\n\n**That's awesome! You're reminding me of the interesting relationship between writing & tinkering when it comes to blogs. They both feed into each other in a strange way. Before, when my blog was on Wordpress, I didn't care about tinkering around — writing was my sole focus. When I moved to my new blog, however, I found myself shift towards creating apps that extend my blog and messing around with its CSS. So it's interesting that you've gone the opposite way, publishing more instead of solely tinkering.**\n\n**What has awoken the urge for you to tackle those items on your personal \"to-write\" list? To open up those taps a bit more? Because I can see the publication mindset, being somewhat of an authority, getting in the way.**\n\nThat is interesting. I'm wondering how many people are in each of our camps. I hate to be so topical, but the pandemic and being home constantly has definitely contributed. I've also begun to learn to let things go, which is an essential skill. Being able to actually kill work when it needs to die is the real secret. I just built up the strength to delete the rest of my 2019 list a few weeks ago.\n\n**I wonder also! And hey, no problem bringing up the current situation. I think it's making me write more also.**\n\n**Want to drill into that practice of letting go as an essential skill for blogging. As a final question for this chat, how have you gone about the decision of keeping ideas that you've had for a long time and when to let them go? It's been something I've been struggling with for recently as ideas for blog posts start to pile up.**\n\nSelf-curation is definitely tough. Generally, it's very hard to let things go - especially when I've progressed at all significantly into research\/first drafting, but I know when to kill something if I reread and am unable to immediately see where I was going. I've noticed that trying to rekindle interest or momentum in a topic is unusually not a worthwhile use of time in my case. If I can't get my rhythm back fairly early in, I am very unlikely to, ever. That said, I think it's also important to *forgive yourself* for investing time in something that won't work out - otherwise, you will settle for less than what you originally intended and release something you won't be happy with. \n\nThank you so much for your time! I really enjoyed this!\n\n**Forgive and forget! That's a great point about rekindling an interest being a sign of letting go of an idea. I've done that too many times. This has been a blast to chat virtually David — really enjoyed your thoughts and am looking forward to future blog posts and installments of *Extratone*!**\n\n#meta","views":1177,"updated":"2022-03-17T18:53:16Z","tags":["100DaystoOffload","meta"],"type":null,"title":"Write.As Interview with CJ Eller","slug":"david-blue-interview","appearance":"norm","language":"en","rtl":false,"created":"2020-05-11T19:03:51Z","collection":{"public":false,"alias":"bilge","total_posts":0,"title":"The Psalms","verification_link":"","description":"A <a href=\"https:\/\/davidblue.wtf\/db.vcf\">narcoleptic yokel<\/a> on software and culture.","style_sheet":"","views":177027,"monetization_pointer":""},"paid":false},{"id":"ou1o7pzywckxzfk4","body":"![Star Trek Discovery](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/pshqmlW.jpg)\n\n## Discovery is pushing boundaries, but for what purpose?\n\n<!--more-->\n\n*Discovery* may no longer be new - not even the newest *Star Trek* property - but it *is* new to me. According to the [alternate timeline exemption](https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20091227080806\/http:\/www.mtv.com\/movies\/news\/articles\/1611063\/20090511\/story.jhtml) of the J.J. movies, I've been left without \"Canon\" *Star Trek* television since 2005 (or 2155) with the last episode of *Enterprise*, but I've been looking forward with moderate anticipation to an opportunity to watch this new entry into \"[the stodgiest and squarest of all sci-fi universes](https:\/\/www.newyorker.com\/culture\/culture-desk\/in-star-trek-discovery-the-future-is-a-simpler-time).\" Though I am extremely well-versed in Gene Roddenberry's baby, I come to both you and *Discovery* with absolutely zero desire to analyze whether or not it is \"Trek\" enough, \"good\" science-fiction, or even \"good\" television - I'd like only to land on your screen between all of these institutions and their proctors in some unique insight from all of them, without the clichés, cringey jokes, or unnecessary *Trek*ism. What I will strive to do is perform [my Special Duty](https:\/\/extratone.com\/solo-star-wars-film-review) in relation to American intellectual property mastodons for which I have my own adoration: to determine whether or not [they should die](https:\/\/extratone.com\/star-wars-the-force-awakens-review). I know absolutely *nothing* about television writing – the same amount I know [about film](https:\/\/extratone.com\/tag:film) – so I hope I can provide something usefully unique.\n\nI would rather *Star Trek* **not** have to die, but I wouldn’t be surprised if it’s necessary. Without sounding like I have to prove myself, know that the property – in particular the history of *Star Trek Online*’s development – was a very important part of my adolescent life. I have watched every episode of every series several times at least, but I know better than to entrust my entire emotional existence into the promise of a continuation like *Discovery*. It most fascinates me how revivals of old names like this go about contextualizing their dialogue and other elements for today’s audience. “[Snug as a bug in a rug](https:\/\/subslikescript.com\/series\/Star_Trek_Discovery-5171438\/season-1\/episode-3-Context_is_for_Kings)” is surely not an expression we should expect to survive the next 250 years of human development, and yet this is supposed to be an aspirational series? It even made it in the recap! I should confess now: it is actually *Star Trek Online* which made me curious enough to seek out a CBS All Access Free Trial. The marketing worked very well.\n\n![The Measure of Morality](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/4Wgb1i1.png)\n\nI tend to install the game for a few weeks or so around this time every year just to check in. This time, I was greeted by [*Star Trek Online: Legacy*](https:\/\/www.pcgamer.com\/star-trek-onlines-legacy-update-lets-you-live-your-star-trek-picard-dreams\/) – a new expansion featuring *Voyager*’s Jeri Ryan and *Discovery*’s Sonequa Martin-Green reprising their respective characters in voiceover roles. I figured out that Michael Burnham must have been from The New Show fairly quickly, but I was disappointed to find out that the character was not in fact a trans man, but rather a female character with an unusually male name. For the most part, Burnham is simply an outlier in *The Measure of Morality* Parts [I](https:\/\/sto.gamepedia.com\/Mission:_The_Measure_of_Morality_(Part_1)) and [II](https:\/\/sto.gamepedia.com\/Mission:_The_Measure_of_Morality_(Part_2)). She accompanies one’s character (along with Seven of Nine) to several different battlegrounds and stories we’d already seen before in previous episodes – *when the budget’s running low, reuse sets*, but there is one instance where *we* are brought into *her* (*Discovery*’s) world, which feels disorienting. The whole experience plays like it was forced upon STO by CBS in order to squeeze as many viewers into our free CBS All Access trials with as little developmental investment into the game as possible. Well, here I am!\n\nIn Season 1, Episode 4 of *Discovery*, the writers made a [very foul mistake](https:\/\/www.geekwire.com\/2017\/star-trek-discovery-elon-musk\/)… They placed fucking Elon Musk’s name alongside the aviation pioneering Wright Brothers and the fictional inventor of warp drive, Zefram Cochrane.\n\n> How do you want to be remembered in history? Alongside the Wright Brothers, Elon Musk, Zefram Cochrane? Or as a failed fungus expert?\n\nI can’t be timid about this – it straight up makes me *ill*. I can *guarantee* you that Orville and Wilbur Wright would have *never* watched fucking *South Park* and that I am actually going to be sick right here on this couch.\n\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet tw-align-center\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">I&#39;m sorry, I don&#39;t look up to anyone who watches South Park. it&#39;s just a personal rule, okay?<\/p>&mdash; David Blue (@NeoYokel) <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/NeoYokel\/status\/1255564278247063555?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">April 29, 2020<\/a><\/blockquote> <script async src=\"https:\/\/platform.twitter.com\/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"><\/script>\n\nI’ll spare you further ranting, but… Jesus Christ. I will not believe that I live in a world where this sort of comparison is acceptable. I’m not going to freak out because they say “shit” and “fuck” now, though I do wonder what Gene Roddenberry (though he [wasn’t all that great](https:\/\/www.nationalreview.com\/2016\/09\/star-trek-gene-roddenberry-was-misogynistic-hack\/), it turns out) would say – something like “[profanity is no longer a necessary part of 23rd century language](https:\/\/youtu.be\/x6-UAditg7Y).” I thought [Morgan Jeffery’s take](https:\/\/www.digitalspy.com\/tv\/ustv\/a840967\/star-trek-discovery-episode-5-fuck-swearing\/) on this for *Digital Spy* was an interesting one:\n\n> There's an argument to be made that the old style of Trek might feel naive in 2017. But there's another that it'd be a refreshing antidote to the times, the Trek we really need right now as opposed to the one we deserve.\n\nI like to watch fellow *Star Trek* enthusiasts squirm and cry “continuity” and “[canon](https:\/\/slate.com\/culture\/2017\/09\/how-shows-like-star-trek-discovery-stick-to-canon.html)” as much as any reasonable human being, but I’m not sure this sort of boundary-pushing is actually productive. Is anything being accomplished? Other than marking *Discovery* forever as *not* “[family-friendly entertainment](https:\/\/www.quora.com\/What-would-Gene-Roddenberry-have-thought-of-the-use-of-the-F-word-in-Star-Trek-Discovery)?” Linguistically, the word “fucking” in “fucking cool” was used for emphasis, which perhaps suggests there was no other way for the character to express that level of enthusiasm. In his [*IndieWire* interview](https:\/\/www.indiewire.com\/2017\/10\/star-trek-discovery-anthony-rapp-interview-fuck-1201887710\/), Anthony Rapp (Paul Stamets) explains: \n\n> “These people just put their brains to work in a really tough way and they had a breakthrough. And I imagine there’s scientists in their labs who might do that any time. We didn’t drop the F-bomb in ‘Star Trek’ by telling something to go fuck themselves. It’s like we did it by saying ‘this is fucking cool.'”\n\n![Stamets in the Spore Drive](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/9epUHlp.png)\n\nIf *Discovery* was “making history,” I’m not so sure what [*Star Trek: Picard*](https:\/\/bilge.world\/star-trek-picard-review) was doing with *fucking* and *pissant*. I’m also not sure it matters at all in the grander scheme. What other freedoms should CBS feel free to explore, now that they’ve said the bad words? What else hasn’t been explored? Bathrooms? Shitting and farting? That has my vote. I really don’t remember as many colloquialisms showing up in the earlier series, but perhaps that’s just because those colloquialisms have since become part of our language. I’m not the greatest television watcher of all time, but I got lost in *Discovery*’s plot, and apparently I’m [not the only one](https:\/\/slate.com\/culture\/2018\/02\/star-trek-discovery-season-1-reviewed.html).\n\n> There turned out to be too many of those twists in Discovery’s first season, and it was frustrating to watch as the writers sidled up to new, risky frontiers for exploration, only to suddenly change course right when things were starting to get interesting.\n\nSeason 1, Episode 7 is called “[Magic to Make the Sanest Man Go Mad](https:\/\/subslikescript.com\/series\/Star_Trek_Discovery-5171438\/season-1\/episode-7-Magic_to_Make_the_Sanest_Man_Go_Mad),” and it’s the most classically *Star Trek* of what I’ve seen. One of those stuck-in-a-time-loop stories which truly makes you want to die. What’s even better and slightly meta: playback kept resetting for me at exactly 21:26 and starting from the beginning while the cat kept stepping on the delete key and destroying this paragraph. I had to keep watching the man from *The* Fucking *Office* continually kill the captain after the crew parties to 250-year-old West Coast hip hop and *300*-year old Al Green all whilst writing this over again. I do not like Rainn Wilson invading my *Star Trek*. He gives Aquariuses a bad name and… beard. “Listen, petunia, I've been screwed over since the day I was born. I deserve this,” he says, and I wonder if in fact it is Rainn himself speaking of his invasion. He looks and sounds like a fucking incel. All of this makes me wonder if my entire problem with this show is simply that I do not particularly like its characters.\n\n![USS Discovery](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/hcE6DfB.png)\n\n## The Vessel\n\nRelying on *Memory Alpha* – a tried-and-true *Star Trek* fan resource – we can examine [the U.S.S. *Discovery*](https:\/\/memory-alpha.fandom.com\/wiki\/USS_Discovery), itself. I’m not so sure about this spore drive shit. If the NCC-1701 *Enterprise* was indeed [launched in 2245](https:\/\/www.startrek.com\/database_article\/enterprise), its existence would blatantly overlap with *Discovery*’s, now wouldn’t it? I don’t actually care all that much, but here are a few screenshots from [*Star Trek Online*](https:\/\/www.arcgames.com\/en\/games\/star-trek-online\/news\/detail\/10772124-the-discovery-lock-box!).\n\n![USS Discovery - Star Trek Online](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/HLtOMGj.jpg)\n\n![USS Discovery - Star Trek Online](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/X6cmK4K.jpg)\n\nNote how much larger this *Crossfield­*-class ship is than the *Intrepid*-class from some [120 years into the future](https:\/\/memory-alpha.fandom.com\/wiki\/Intrepid_class). Then again, the latter was designed for “long-range exploration missions” and *Discovery* is the fleet’s flagship(?) Its “most advanced ship,” at least. The inclusion of technologies like the [holodeck](https:\/\/memory-alpha.fandom.com\/wiki\/Holodeck) and the [spore drive](https:\/\/memory-alpha.fandom.com\/wiki\/Spore_drive) (perhaps the show’s most potent plot device,) though, are really stretching the canon timeline’s ability to accommodate them. The decision to [include the *Discovery*](https:\/\/www.arcgames.com\/en\/games\/star-trek-online\/news\/detail\/10772124-the-discovery-lock-box!) as a playable, top-tier ship in *Star Trek Online* is 100% a business one, surely. I’m not here to judge, though – after all, games are about having *fun*, right? One of *Star Trek*’s ironies has always been its existence in a capitalist society as an IP within a [debatably socialist future](https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2017\/07\/24\/opinion\/make-it-so-star-trek-and-its-debt-to-revolutionary-socialism.html). (Everybody wants to see their [own ideal socioeconomic label](https:\/\/cameronharwick.com\/blog\/the-political-philosophy-of-star-trek\/) in this future, it would seem.) “What makes *Star Trek*’s economics fundamentally different, and, in many ways, fundamentally incomprehensible to us, is that scarcity is no longer a factor,” says [Dale Franks](https:\/\/medium.com\/@dalefranks\/is-star-trek-socialist-83f766828b33). Today, though, *Star Trek* properties still require finite resources and labor to produce, and they always have. Atari spent [over $50 million](https:\/\/www.gamesindustry.biz\/articles\/atari-acquires-cryptic-studios) to acquire Cryptic Studios – the original developers of *Star Trek Online* – and *Discovery* supposedly cost “$[6-7 million per episode](https:\/\/variety.com\/2016\/tv\/news\/bryan-fuller-showrunner-star-trek-discovery-cbs-1201901398\/).” Though the former is free-to-play, it’s filled with microtransactions and about 5 billion different currencies. When [*Star Trek.com* says](https:\/\/www.startrek.com\/news\/ten-years-of-star-trek-online) “*Star Trek Online* is best described as a permanent *Star Trek* convention,” they’re correct: **it is full of shit to buy**.\n\nThere is also *a lot* of combat, though *Discovery* seems to have struck a healthy balance between warfare and other intrigues. It is definitely *Trek* in many ways: redshirts die without any plot consequence and all the classic character flaw tropes are represented. There is the aforementioned time loop episode with fucking Harry Mudd and even a mirror universe arc beginning with “[Despite Yourself](https:\/\/subslikescript.com\/series\/Star_Trek_Discovery-5171438\/season-1\/episode-10-Despite_Yourself),” in which the crew actually responds to their new environment and does the research required to blend in with the Terran forces. This took an ancient *Star Trek* format and actually explored a new, interesting avenue within it (the time loop episode did not.) They even change the *Discovery*’s registry on the hull to read “[ISS Discovery](https:\/\/memory-alpha.fandom.com\/wiki\/ISS_Discovery)” instead of “USS.”\n\n> Every moment is a test. Can you bury your heart? Can you hide your decency? Can you continue to pretend to be one of them? Even as, little by little, it kills the person you really are.\n\n## Complaints\n\nThere’s a reason we all hate Captain Lorca, and why he says things like “[sometimes the ends justify terrible means](https:\/\/subslikescript.com\/series\/Star_Trek_Discovery-5171438\/season-1\/episode-11-The_Wolf_Inside)” and “[there’s no way we’re asking *these* neighbors for a cup of sugar](https:\/\/subslikescript.com\/series\/Star_Trek_Discovery-5171438\/season-1\/episode-10-Despite_Yourself).” I do not believe in Spoilers, but there’s not much reason for me to tell you why, specifically. Perhaps it is racist and\/or misogynist to say so, but I found it difficult to get as attached to *Discovery*’s characters as I have to those of series past. Michael is great, of course, though my girlfriend Sierra surmised that her purpose in the show is to illustrate that “nobody listens to black women.” Sierra was also quite aggravated by the misunderstanding and mistreatment of the tardigrade. When Paul Stamets mentioned that his uncle Everett participated in a Beatles cover band, we both despaired, for we discovered an entry in *Memory Alpha* for “[The Beatles](https:\/\/memory-alpha.fandom.com\/wiki\/The_Beatles).” If I were to standardize a system of measurement for my television ratings, *Discovery*’s **cringe factor** would be 9\/10. The holodeck hasn’t been invented yet!\n\nAlso, CBS All Access’ user interface is the worst I’ve ever seen from a streaming service, across iOS, desktop browser, and my Samsung television. It’s impossible to scrub, really, or to dictate a preference for high definition. One cannot navigate backward between episodes without re-searching the title and navigating through an incredibly clunky menu sequence. I was able to cast to both my Samsung TV and Sierra’s Chromecast from my iPhone, at least.\n\n![Star Trek Discovery - CBS All Access](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/WvjZPUy.jpg)\n\n## Compliments\n\nDespite its failings (including Rainn Wilson,) *Discovery*’s acting is superb. [James Frain as Sarek](https:\/\/www.startrek.com\/article\/james-frain-joins-discovery-as-sarek), especially, is the best of the three. I thought it was especially thoughtful that for the most part (at least in Season 1,) the Klingons *actually spoke Klingon* to each other. Given that [Dr. Marc Okrand](https:\/\/www.kli.org\/about-klingon\/klingon-history\/) spent the time and effort to construct a fully-functional Klingon language, it seems only reasonable to include as much of it as possible. I also love [Hugh Culber](https:\/\/memory-alpha.fandom.com\/wiki\/Hugh_Culber)’s doctor’s uniform and the “cinematic” cinematography of the whole thing. It’s very much an action show, yet not quite obnoxious.\n\nSo, **should \\*Star Trek\\* die**? Perhaps it shows my extreme bias, but no, I do not think it need perish quite yet. From my (white, male, cishet) perspective, *Discovery* does an okay job at remaining thoroughly *Trek* whilst [acknowledging the present context’s social issues](https:\/\/www.newyorker.com\/tech\/annals-of-technology\/for-alt-right-trolls-star-trek-discovery-is-an-unsafe-space).

This is especially puzzling given the overwhelmingly positive experience I was privileged to have with one 2014 Volkswagen Jetta TDI Sportwagen over the past year. It would find me signing up to Facebook groups, using real Fast Boy terms, revisiting long-lost roads of home, and returning to my local community in an extremely intimate ridesharing stint. Throughout it all, the Jetta made me smile much *much* more than I would’ve thought. I found a real love for this relatively simpleton form of transportation that I *should* have seen coming, but did not at all. There is something delightfully indulgent about a manual-equipped diesel wagon. Even [*The New York Times*](https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2013\/10\/20\/automobiles\/autoreviews\/diesel-wagon-whatll-they-think-of-next.html) knows this:\n\n> Auto writers have long tooted the horn about the benefits of diesel engines, and a bunch of them have also argued that the old-school station wagon is a far more efficient way to haul things around than a bloated high-set S.U.V.\n\nI knew it, too, apparently, long before I actually decided to act on a purchase. On October 24th, 2012, I Tweeted “[I sat in a Jetta wagon today. I need one](https:\/\/twitter.com\/NeoYokel\/status\/261163556073005056).” I really did intend on becoming The Jetta Man (perhaps without the fashion.) In acquiring it, my plan - and it was a good plan - was to cease an era of general insensibility in my life's decisions by entombing my wayward self within the most sensible expression of modern automotive design I suspected I could live with. The wagon component joined with diesel power and a manual transmission upon casual research. Diesel, manual, wagon - of the people's car, these I sought. Nay, *demanded*.\n\nAn ex-girlfriend of mine drove an utterly decimated Mk. V Jetta Sedan which she’d acquired in some sort of dicey deal. I remember finding it surprisingly robust given its lot, and quite dynamic to drive. We traveled all over the Midwest in it – from central Missouri to Des Moines to Chicago to Kansas City and back again. I mocked, but it was everything one could hope for in cheap transportation and quite a bit more. It turns out, Volkswagen was shooting high. As Tony Quiroga [recalls for *Car & Driver*](https:\/\/www.caranddriver.com\/reviews\/a15129377\/volkswagen-jetta-review-2011-volkswagen-jetta-first-drive\/):\n\n> During the press launch of the outgoing Jetta back in 2005, Volkswagen touted that car as a less expensive alternative to an Acura TSX or Volvo S40. Volkswagen pointed to its growth in size, high-quality interior, new rear suspension, and refined demeanor as evidence that the Jetta had moved out of the Honda Civic and Toyota Corolla class.\n\nIn terms of **premium** compacts, my experience is quite limited, but it’s no wonder the company has struggled to find a place in the market for this product: in German, “Volkswagen Jetta” literally means “[people’s car jet stream](https:\/\/www.roadandtrack.com\/car-culture\/a24487598\/volkswagen-golf-jetta-passat-polo-name-origin\/).” The first component is infamous, of course, because of the Nazis and their [horrid Beetle](https:\/\/www.history.com\/this-day-in-history\/volkswagen-is-founded), but the second seems to be almost entirely unknown. In my research, I had to specifically investigate the Jetta’s name before reading anything about it. When an American thinks of “Jetta,” they unconsciously dissociate the word from the “jet” sound and make [largely unsophisticated jokes](https:\/\/carstereotypes.com\/car-stereotypes\/volkswagen-jetta-stereotypes\/). (It’s also *Regular Car Reviews*’ [most hated car](https:\/\/youtu.be\/2KZb545b4MU).) Now, the name has become a marque in and of itself: in China, Volkswagen [began selling several different models](https:\/\/www.volkswagen-newsroom.com\/en\/press-releases\/jetta-brand-successfully-launched-in-chinese-market-5647) under the JETTA brand last year. This also was news to me, and *I* try to keep up with the industry.\n\nIn 2011, the Mk. VI Jetta was [released](https:\/\/www.motortrend.com\/cars\/volkswagen\/jetta\/2011\/2011-volkswagen-jetta\/) with an outdated base, 115-hp powertrain and a “hard plastic [interior] that wouldn’t look out of place in a Chrysler Sebring.” (Quiroga insults, to clarify.) Compared to the Mk. V, “Volkswagen made it clear that the targets are once again the strong-selling Civic and Corolla.” Once again, I’m at a loss for experience in the equivalent extra-Volkswagen competition, save for the [Chevrolet Cruze](https:\/\/youtu.be\/40x4TF-6ggc) and Kia Forte. (Surprisingly, GM actually produced a diesel version of the Cruze and [*AutoGuide* compared it against the Jetta TDI](https:\/\/youtu.be\/dH-FZyKTY3s).) It’s been too long since I last drove my ex’s Mk. V to really have much to say, but I do remember a particular solidity about the steering – perhaps because it was still hydraulic. Once again, I’ll rely on Tony:\n\n> Less obvious cost cutting includes the loss of adjustability for the center armrest, a lack of lumbar adjustment in most models, no more power-reclining seatbacks, and a simpler stability-control program that can no longer be shut off or even reduced.\n\nWhen I began searching for my first ever truly modern car in February 2019, I surprisingly only needed to pass up a single option in the Kansas City area before I found The One: a 2014 post-[Dieselgate](https:\/\/youtu.be\/SvokGhOaHGg) example with ~65,000 miles on its odometer in “Deep Black Pearl” with a “Cornsilk Beige” interior which had been previously owned only by a single Michigan cyclist. I’d been without a car since dailying\/living in a [1976 Lincoln Continental](https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/p\/BiYABpKAJQX) the year before, in Portland, and my friend had driven me around everywhere in his Wrangler for a full month (thanks, Jack!) I’d walked around and cold-idled another, high-mileage Sportwagen, but I was committed to getting something with a light-colored interior after the red velvet cake Lincoln and my dank smoking room-dark XJR.\n\n![Martin Racing](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/HRE2hlh.jpg)\n\nThree of us walked into a dealership in the middle of a frigid Kansas afternoon – Jack, my girlfriend Sierra, and I. We hovered by a smart, gleaming little Golf GTI whilst my salesman, Charles, retrieved the car I had found online. After he finished copying my driver’s license while the little diesel warmed up, the four of us set off into suburban Lawrence. Back when the Mk. VI Golf was released, I attended a Volkswagen dealership event in which Mk. V and Mk. VI GTIs were driven back-to-back – I’m assuming to reassure buyers that yes, they *really had* made it better (though I was quite vocal in my disagreement about this, to the dealer’s chagrin.) The car I bought immediately reminded me more of the former – perhaps I just enjoy the increased body roll of a 50,000+ mile suspension – albeit with a much longer wheelbase and significantly more torque. Rowing through the gears, I was immediately impressed and bewildered by the characteristics of the 140-horsepower, 236 lb.-ft.-developing diesel powerplant. The diesel engines I grew up around in tractors, combines, and other heavy machinery were designed to more or less remain at a constant, relatively low RPM for the majority of their use cases. It’s not a screamer, but the idea that a diesel engine can *rev* at all was something that took a bit to wrap my head around. However, it is almost immediately evident that carrying on to the 6000 RPM (?) redline is a futile and incorrect practice. There is nothing at all to be found up there.\n\nI’ve driven some quick straight-line cars in my time, but none of them have delivered their power anything like the Jetta’s long-distinguished 2.0L inline-four. It’s very odd having comparatively so little actual horsepower, yet so much torque – I’d heard Jeremy Clarkson complain about diesel power coming in “great lumps,” but I’d already started to find them extremely (and positively) amusing in my first few minutes. When asked, the oil burner will produce protracted front tire squeal and torque steer from a stop, which is odd and hilarious coming from such an otherwise docile automobile. Also hilarious: Charles likely noted that Jack, Sierra, and I were (and are) entirely unafraid of facing The End when a very near collision during our test drive did not perturb us in the least, but left him huffing and puffing from adrenaline. He was a star, though, throughout the more than four hours of deliberations required for his institution to reckon with my credit history. Eventually, I ended up spending almost exactly $12,000, which was probably too much, and named my new automobile Martin - \"Marty\" for short - after Martin Winterkorn, the former CEO of Volkswagen AG who [bore more than his share of the blame](https:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2018-05-03\/ex-vw-ceo-winterkorn-charged-by-u-s-in-diesel-cheating-case) for Dieselgate, including [charges of fraud](https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2019\/4\/16\/18369528\/vw-ceo-martin-winterkorn-dieselgate-germany-volkswagen-emissions-scandal) by the German government. *Dirty diesel rolling coal in prison*.\n\n## Naughty Diesel\n\nBy \"post-Dieselgate,\" I mean that my new car was a part of [Volkwagen's $10 billion buyback program](https:\/\/www.caranddriver.com\/news\/a15344947\/whats-volkswagen-doing-with-all-those-repurchased-diesels\/), so the Michigander sold it back to the manufacturer for its \"fair replacement value\" - [between $12,500 and $44,000](https:\/\/www.caranddriver.com\/news\/a15347930\/volkswagen-settles-diesel-emissions-violations-for-14-7-billion-even-more-fines-to-come\/) according to *Car & Driver* on behalf of FTC chairwoman Edith Ramirez. To be technical, the powerplant is a 2.0L [EA189\/CJAA](https:\/\/www.motorreviewer.com\/engine.php?engine_id=43) turbodiesel four-cylinder. “The EA 189 was one of the most important engines in the company, destined not only for millions of Volkswagen-brand cars but also for a wide variety of other brands from the parent Volkswagen Group, like Audi, Skoda and Seat, as well as some light utility vehicles,” said [*The New York Times*](https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2015\/10\/05\/business\/engine-shortfall-pushed-volkswagen-to-evade-emissions-testing.html) regarding the “clean diesel” “scheme.” In original spec, 236 lb.-ft. of it arrived between 1750-2800 RPM, but my (admittedly, unscientific) perception indicates that post-update, the torque was coming a bit later. If I thought you were interested, I would attempt to detail [exactly what my car was then subjected to](https:\/\/www.caranddriver.com\/news\/a15351089\/volkswagen-details-fix-for-ea189-diesel-in-europe-but-itll-be-more-complex-for-u-s) by a dealer, but suffice it to say that it was made less fuel efficient and a bit less powerful, to my displeasure. For a complete and comprehensive video on the scandal, try [*Regular Car Reviews*](https:\/\/youtu.be\/SvokGhOaHGg). I’d also recommend the following reading from [*Jalopnik*](https:\/\/jalopnik.com\/your-guide-to-dieselgate-volkswagens-diesel-cheating-c-1731857018), [*The Verge*](https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2018\/10\/2\/17928314\/audi-ceo-rupert-stadler-fired-volkswagen-dieselgate), [*The New York Times*](https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2019\/04\/15\/business\/winterkorn-volkswagen-emissions-scandal.html), and [*The Independent*](https:\/\/www.independent.co.uk\/news\/business\/news\/volkswagen-ceo-martin-winterkorn-fraud-charges-germany-a8870541.html).\n\n![Martin and Locomotive](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/jfgT5Qu.jpg)\n\nMy own views on Dieselgate are entirely irrelevant, but I will note that buying back a buyback car for such a price felt like a favor to my dealer and that it’s pretty cool to have my own copy of [VW’s Extended Emissions Warranty Notice](https:\/\/www.vwdiesellookup.com\/pdf\/VWCourtSettlement_Emissions_Disclosure_Gen2_Automatic_Final.pdf), not to mention the fact that I actually made use of it (which I will discuss later.) From my perspective, the automotive industry is *the* most heavily-regulated business space in the world and I’d suggest a company like the Volkswagen Group feeling like they should cheat on emissions testing might indicate that the standards of the test could be unreasonable and\/or unrealistic.\n\nAfter returning from almost two hellish, extremely confusing years in Portland taking public transport, Martin became a vehicle for a rediscovery and newfound appreciation for my Missouri home – the great Missouri River, especially. Not since owning my Miata had I driven so much in the country. Sierra and I [visited Cooper’s Landing](https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/p\/BuP3y62laon\/) in the wet and ventured down to Springfield, Missouri (very far South,) near which we discovered [Hodges Speedway](https:\/\/dieselgoth.com\/race-day-at-hodges) – a [then-abandoned dirt oval](https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/AsphaltApostle\/videos\/10218812861450693) surrounded by demolition derby casualties and the large trucks used to haul them around.\n\n![Martin Hiding](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/Yjq0MbT.jpg)\n\nSomewhere North of Kansas City, I opened the taps all the way on a very long straight and reached 125mph, which is either the aerodynamic VMax, an electronically limited limit, or both. Surprisingly, the modern People’s Car feels quite stable at this speed – were it not my own automobile, I’m not sure I wouldn’t just travel this fast everywhere. In the past few years, Interstate 70 – which cuts Missouri just about in half from West-East, connecting St. Louis and Kansas City with my hometown in the center – has become significantly faster-paced than I remembered it before moving to Portland for two years. 80mph used to be the accepted number, 70 (the actual speed limit) was the unenforced minimum. In my old Toyota pickup, I could travel at 65 without attracting too much criticism. *Now*, however, one must maintain 85 to keep up with traffic, especially when traveling with commuters. 90-95 will no longer garner judgmental looks and 100mph left-laners are given a pass.\n\n“I’ll bet that’s great on the highway” is probably the most regular comment received from passersby and riders right after “is this a diesel!?” (Really, the fact of my Jetta’s existence as a manual-equipped diesel wagon seemed to utterly astound a great many people.) There is truth in this general supposition: the ability of the diesel powerplant to deliver hill-climbing torque at low RPM is simply unmatched by gasoline powerplants of the same displacement, which means that “highway” driving entails virtually zero downshifting – arrive in sixth gear, set the cruise control, take a nap. Everything else is taken care of. There is a definite luxury in the knowledge that one is no longer needed in the process at speed – luxury that is NOT present in a gasoline-to-manual Jetta drivetrain. From [*Hackaday*](https:\/\/hackaday.com\/2019\/09\/26\/the-future-of-diesel-is-on-shaky-ground\/):\n\n> [Diesel] has a higher volumetric energy density than gasoline, and thanks to low volatility, diesel engines can run at significantly higher compression ratios without risking detonation. These benefits allow diesel engines to produce significantly more torque than similarly sized gasoline engines.\n\n![Fat Martin](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/58ZyiRO.jpg)\n\n“Diesel engines are typically poor when it comes to power to weight ratio, as their high compression ratio and torque output demands heavier materials in their construction,” notes Lewin Day, meaning *steel* engine block. Here we arrive on my singular dissatisfaction with the Jetta: **its weight**. While traveling from Kansas City back home in the East one day, I decided to satisfy a longtime bucketlist item and stop by a weigh station. As I drove up to the scale, the police-uniformed attendant looked up at me from his glass box and gave [the standard white guy smile frown](https:\/\/twitter.com\/rashadpls\/status\/650114296937058304). It took a moment for the scale to register Martin, but it eventually displayed a whole **3440** **lbs**. My little “compact” wagon… weighed significantly more than one and three-quarter tons – just 528 lbs. less than the [full-sized, supercharged V8-powered Jaguar saloon car](https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/p\/BJPe6rWAcnr\/) I call the automotive love of my life, and almost a full 200 lbs. more than [its GLI sedan sibling](https:\/\/www.caranddriver.com\/reviews\/a15129379\/2011-volkswagen-jetta-gli-20-tsi-review\/). There was one single advantage to this weight: we were able to use Martin as a ballast to help [re-spool the winch cable on Jack’s Wrangler](https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/tv\/BwBEetwlUEF).\n\nAfter discovering this figure, I did what I could to diminish the weight easily without tearing into the seats or removing some of the car’s *fourteen* airbags. Upon lifting up the base of the “car-go” area in the rear, I found a *full* steel spare wheel – some 30 lbs of it at least – which I immediately removed, along with some sort of flapping cargo restraint that I can only suspect was designed to keep objects (like dogs, perhaps) in the cargo area from sailing into the passenger compartment during an accident (it’s called the “luggage compartment cover” in the [owner’s manual](https:\/\/api.ownersmanualvw.com\/#\/vin\/3VWML7AJ7EM619155\/home\/lang\/en-us).) Ideally, I intended to one day strip out all of the interior except for the driver’s side chair, but it ‘twas not intended to be.\n\nAfter driving the Jetta for about a week, I was on the short commute back home from the office when I noticed that the cooling fans were running at what sounded like maximum capacity. Then, at a red light, I felt some rough dips in the engine’s idle. When I reached home minutes later, I turned off the ignition and removed the key only to find the fans still spooling. I was convinced I had already broken the car somehow in rough driving, but in reality, Marty was in the process of [Diesel Particulate Filter (DPF) Regeneration](https:\/\/dieselnet.com\/tech\/dpf_regen.php) – a procedure designed to clean the little shitpot under the hood by heating it up some thousands of degrees to burn off built up diesel exhaust soot. At least, this is the way I understand it.\n\nOtherwise, I disagree with most reviews about the “diesel rumble” being bothersome. Perhaps it’s because this is by far the most modern car I’ve ever spent this much time with – the *only* car I’ve ever spent so much consecutive time with, in fact – or because I did, indeed, grow up sitting (and standing) right next to 8-liter turbodiesels at full chat for hours on end. Compared to my mother’s 1.4L gasoline-powered Mk. VII sedan at idle in her garage, there is a more pronounced clacking, but it’s nothing you’d have any trouble sleeping through. I would know! Whilst driving for Uber and Lyft through one of the [warmest summers on record](https:\/\/www.therolladailynews.com\/news\/20190926\/second-hottest-august-ever-wettest-january-to-august-on-record), I idled away many hours parked on the street with the (averagely effective) air-conditioning on. I idled when I wasn’t online, too – I would even go as far as to say that I made idling one of the trendiest activities of Summer 2019. \n\n> What’re you up to man?\n> Nothin’ much yo. Just over here idling.\n\n## Ridesharing\n\nFor more than six months, my primary income was from Uber and Lyft driving around Columbia, MO – a distinctly academically-dominated demographic. Frankly, I can’t think of any vehicle more suited to what ridesharing actually entails than a diesel Jetta wagon. It’s a relatively spacious and comfortable place to be for four adults – certainly when no trip lasts longer than thirty minutes – with a ridiculously stout cargo capacity. I was able to fit *9* freshman fraternity guys in for a short trip once. Their faces were all genuinely somber as one expressed “it’s really hard having 8 friends when we try to go out.” (No, you’re not supposed to accept those rides.) It was a challenge carrying some 1500 lbs. of Sad Boys, mostly for the brakes. Once, a group of young men and women began to make fun after noticing the DIESELGEEK decal I’d stuck on my side’s rear quarter window (which I’d acquired with a new [shifter bushing kit](https:\/\/www.dieselgeek.com\/products\/high-performance-vw-shifter-shaft-bushings-for-mk4-golf-jetta-new-beetle?variant=6292541866027).) “So are you a diesel geek?” they asked, jeering to themselves, to which I responded: “you know, it’s so weird you mention that because I know this place that sells these stickers…” They no longer seemed amused.\n\nAll of the cars I’ve owned have been attention-grabbing in their own way – my old Toyota pickup was adored by the locals; my Miata was adored by other Miata owners. My XJR was gorgeous and my Swamp Continental seemed to be passionately coveted by absolutely everyone over 40. With the Jetta, though, I did not expect any unusual attention whatsoever, yet I must confess that more conversations were started about it than of all of the others, combined. Ridesharing will do that, yes, but it is ridiculous how many people of all races, classes, and ages were enamored by – or overly curious about – Martin.\n\n> What is this a Jetta, dude? Is this a Jetta? Whoa! Dude, is this a stickshift!? Dude I think this is a stickshift. BRO. I can’t believe you’re driving a stick right now. He’s driving a stickshift car! Wow I think this is a manual car! Oh shit this is a **diesel**!? It’s a diesel too?! No way! I can’t believe you’re out here driving a diesel Jetta wagon bro. Is this a stickshift? You can drive stick!?\n\nNo.\n\nEarly one morning, a ride was requested from the local news station just out of town – a fascinating place. News vans parked in a converted horse stable. They farm televisions out there. A few minutes into the ride, after picking up the young woman, I noticed in the rearview mirror out of my eye’s corner that she had put down her phone to watch my right hand with total bewilderment. Eventually, she asked “what are you doing to the car?” She’d never heard of a manual transmission before. I did my best to explain, but when she asked “but why wouldn’t you just buy a regular car?” I did not have a sufficient answer. Unlike many automotive enthusiasts, I think it’s totally okay that people are allowed to exist independent of this knowledge. There are many, many other things in life to worry about. [80% of cars sold in the United States](https:\/\/dieselgoth.com\/automatic-transmission-inefficiency) are shipped with automatics and expecting every young person who lives in an urban environment to think about automobiles as anything beyond simple transportation is asking a lot.\n\nWhile we’re on the topic of manual transmissions, it’s relevant to mention how excellent the Jetta TDI is as a vehicle to teach first timers how to operate one. With the clutch in, the engine will not rev beyond 3500 RPM thanks to an electronic limiter, which dramatically reduces the number of obligatory stalls when learning clutch control. The learner can simply hold the accelerator to the floor as they get the hang of declutching instead of having to receive shouts of “more gas!” repeatedly. Of course, being a diesel further eases those stresses with much more readily available torque. Sierra was able to grasp the basics this way in a *single night*, which is unprecedented in my experience. She found particular comfort in the suggested gear indicator on the instrument panel’s main information display, which is very conservative, naturally, but also apparently relief from some great anxiety regarding the question *which gear should I be in right now*?\n\n## Community\n\nI have derided Facebook for my entire adult life for its shitty design, inaspirational effect on its users, and its massive intellectual power, but strangely, through Jetta ownership, I was able to find a community on the service that couldn’t be found elsewhere. Groups like [TDI Scumbags](https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/groups\/173989949914106), [VW TDI Owners](https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/groups\/24097854515), [VW TDI support group](https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/groups\/1088169071220271), and [VW TDI Owners Performance and Tech Talk](https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/groups\/2501785479863909) are full of absolutely hilarious and insightful content that I’m genuinely glad I didn’t miss.\n\nhttps:\/\/www.instagram.com\/p\/B52_ViunyoH\/\n\nOn Instagram, I found [@jp_eurogarage’s Mk. IV diesel sportwagen](https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/p\/B52_ViunyoH\/), which I adore. I especially love [its idle](https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/p\/Bp-LXMbFNza\/). @projectownersclub [posted a video](https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/p\/BrddAqWHpBZ\/) in December, 2018 of a *very* rusty diesel Mk. III with a straight vertical stack spewing smoke all over its owner’s yard. A video was shared on one of my Facebook groups captioned “[when you only drive manual](https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/watch\/?v=448084355761412)” in which a very generic-looking white man with moustache finds himself gagging in a car with a traditional automatic transmission. The wholesomeness of these posts is often adorable, and not only on Facebook.

Perhaps the most famous appearance of the Jetta Sportwagen in The Web Era was driving instructor Austin Cabot’s 2014 Sportwagen in [one of Matt Farah’s infamous *One-Take*s](https:\/\/youtu.be\/x3HwWn55MJY). You can find the full list of modifications on [the car’s *WheelWell* page](https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20220702015202\/https:\/\/www.wheelwell.com\/austin-cabot\/im7\/2014-volkswagen-jetta-sportwagen). I intended to emulate Austin with a few modifications including Dieselgeek’s [Sigma 6 shortshift kit](https:\/\/www.dieselgeek.com\/collections\/vw-short-shifters\/products\/sigma-6-six-speed-short-shift-kit-for-vw) and “high performance” [shifter bushing kit](https:\/\/www.dieselgeek.com\/products\/high-performance-vw-shifter-shaft-bushings-for-mk4-golf-jetta-new-beetle?variant=6292541866027) (which I did get around to buying, but never installed.) For those interested in engine\/ECU tuning, Malone Tuning has a [beautiful tool](https:\/\/malonetuning.com\/ecu-tuning\/VW\/2014\/Jetta\/2.0L-CR-TDI-CJAA-EA189-2012-2014\/Stock) to help you customize your order.\n\n![Malone Tuning Stage 2](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/uApnhy4.png)\n\nInstead of installing the shortshift kit right away, I decided to splurge on a bespoke [Raceseng Ashiko weighted shift knob](https:\/\/www.ecstuning.com\/b-raceseng-parts\/ashiko-shift-knob-red-texture-no-engraving-vw-audi-adapter\/08311421~rsg), which made throws immediately better. The issue these products are combatting is the particularly disconnected gearshift which Volkswagen has been notorious for the past few decades. The best way I can describe it is that it feels like you’re just operating a lever instead of shifting a transmission, if that makes sense.\n\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet tw-align-center\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">got that <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/raceseng?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@raceseng<\/a> knob. feels immensely better even pre-short shift kit.

I also “[deleted](https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/tv\/ByJ3-u4luhV65nfvVjZ94z00WOTjImro12LtXw0\/)” (removed, in other words) the (likely) faux-leather shift boot after realizing that I’ve always hated the sound and sensation of them, but hadn’t been willing to modify my previous cars in *any* way. It sounds ridiculous, but it’s actually quite personally noteworthy that I was able to traverse the unseen boundary into *mod culture*. The result was a slightly more mechanical-feeling shift that would’ve certainly been [vastly improved](https:\/\/youtu.be\/Rh02yxy9SbE) by installation of Dieselgeek’s kit.\n\n<iframe width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/PVJJ8pcHegg?controls=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe>\n\nAnother aspirational goal of mine for Martin: [H&R’s Sport Springs Set](https:\/\/www.ecstuning.com\/b-h-and-r-parts\/sport-springs-set\/54751\/) paired with a set of [Firestone Firehawk Indy 500s](https:\/\/www.tirerack.com\/tires\/tires.jsp?tireMake=Firestone&tireModel=Firehawk+Indy+500&partnum=055WR6FHI5&autoMake=Volkswagen&autoModel=Jetta+Sportwagen&autoYear=2014&autoModClar=TDI). The goal was to sure up some of that body roll and torque-induced wheelspin. I suspect the result would’ve been a very, very sticky Martin. Unfortunately, I would not get the chance before I killed him in an accident on December 22nd of last year.\n\n### Efficiency\n\nAverage: **29.84** mpg\nTotal Gallons Pumped: **644**\nTotal Spent: $**1726.94**\nTotal Miles Driven: **19506**\n\nAccording to my fuel logs, (they are public, yes, though not necessarily 100% complete,) I averaged close to 30 mpg over 78 fillups and just over 19500 miles. Considering that I was ridesharing most of that time and driving quite obnoxiously for all of it, you should be very impressed. “Diesels tend to get about 30-percent better fuel economy than their conventional counterparts,” says *Consumer Reports* in a [comparison between diesels and hybrids](https:\/\/www.consumerreports.org\/cro\/news\/2013\/10\/diesel-offer-great-highway-fuel-economy\/index.htm) dating back to 2013. From the [*Union of Concerned Scientists*](https:\/\/blog.ucsusa.org\/dave-cooke\/diesel-vs-hybrid-cost-benefits-410):\n\n> Much of the reason for diesel vehicle’s high fuel economy has to do with the diesel combustion process; however, some of the increase in fuel economy is due to the simple fact that a gallon of diesel fuel contains more energy than a gallon of gasoline.\n\nThe joy my Sportwagen brought me was not expected. My plan to make myself a more reasonable person (and driver) by buying a “boring” car was obviously foiled by the diesel’s torque, the community’s dynamism, and my own communion with mod culture. I spent more consecutive time driving the Jetta than I have in any other automobile and was able to truly enjoy it. After my experience owning a diesel-powered Volkswagen, I would very much like to try driving\/owning the [Golf GDI](https:\/\/www.topgear.com\/car-reviews\/volkswagen\/golfgolf-sv\/20-tdi-184-gtd-5dr\/first-drive) – a performance-oriented diesel version of their excellent hatch. Truthfully – given the way I killed Martin – I did not deserve his kinship, but I’m certainly grateful I had the experience.\n\n<!--comment-->\n\n---\n\n#auto","views":470,"updated":"2023-11-02T23:09:04Z","tags":["FFF","8EB8DE","auto"],"type":null,"title":"Kinship of the Jetta, Deserving","slug":"volkswagen-jetta-sportwagen-tdi-review","appearance":"norm","language":"en","rtl":false,"created":"2020-05-13T05:55:28Z","images":["https:\/\/i.snap.as\/jfgT5Qu.jpg","https:\/\/i.snap.as\/58ZyiRO.jpg","https:\/\/statics.wheelwell.com\/u\/2bea4141-49c4-4e91-a300-e2de56f973fe.large.jpg","http:\/\/d2yobvf5u8yliy.cloudfront.net\/357e0360-26fd-46a9-b96e-7bcf3bbffd3c.png","http:\/\/d2yobvf5u8yliy.cloudfront.net\/2ce66dca-9ecc-4d13-a723-e20ac3662560.png","https:\/\/i.snap.as\/uApnhy4.png","https:\/\/i.snap.as\/qW5VDLj.jpg","https:\/\/i.snap.as\/HRE2hlh.jpg","http:\/\/d2yobvf5u8yliy.cloudfront.net\/6044d824-48c2-480e-800b-d78fd17c4080.png","https:\/\/i.snap.as\/Yjq0MbT.jpg","http:\/\/d2yobvf5u8yliy.cloudfront.net\/eee11a3a-e76d-43fb-9289-f8421ac8d8af.png"],"collection":{"public":false,"alias":"bilge","total_posts":0,"title":"The Psalms","verification_link":"","description":"A <a href=\"https:\/\/davidblue.wtf\/db.vcf\">narcoleptic yokel<\/a> on software and culture.","style_sheet":"","views":177027,"monetization_pointer":""},"paid":false},{"id":"nbwh8bs4j8qwnd3t","body":"![Mk VII and Mk VI](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/qW5VDLj.jpg)\n\nThough I grew up on a farm surrounded by (and loving) diesel equipment, owning a diesel-powered automobile somehow never occurred to me. This is especially puzzling given the overwhelmingly positive experience I was privileged to have with one 2014 Volkswagen Jetta TDI Sportwagen over the past year. It would find me signing up to Facebook groups, using real Fast Boy terms, revisiting long-lost roads of home, and returning to my local community in an extremely intimate ridesharing stint. Throughout it all, the Jetta made me smile much *much* more than I would’ve thought. I found a real love for this relatively simpleton form of transportation that I *should* have seen coming, but did not at all. There is something delightfully indulgent about a manual-equipped diesel wagon. Even [*The New York Times*](https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2013\/10\/20\/automobiles\/autoreviews\/diesel-wagon-whatll-they-think-of-next.html) knows this:\n\n> Auto writers have long tooted the horn about the benefits of diesel engines, and a bunch of them have also argued that the old-school station wagon is a far more efficient way to haul things around than a bloated high-set S.U.V.\n\nI knew it, too, apparently, long before I actually decided to act on a purchase. On October 24th, 2012, I Tweeted “[I sat in a Jetta wagon today. I need one](https:\/\/twitter.com\/NeoYokel\/status\/261163556073005056).” I really did intend on becoming The Jetta Man (perhaps without the fashion.) In acquiring it, my plan - and it was a good plan - was to cease an era of general insensibility in my life's decisions by entombing my wayward self within the most sensible expression of modern automotive design I suspected I could live with. The wagon component joined with diesel power and a manual transmission upon casual research. Diesel, manual, wagon - of the people's car, these I sought. Nay, *demanded*.\n\nAn ex-girlfriend of mine drove an utterly decimated Mk. V Jetta Sedan which she’d acquired in some sort of dicey deal. I remember finding it surprisingly robust given its lot, and quite dynamic to drive. We traveled all over the Midwest in it – from central Missouri to Des Moines to Chicago to Kansas City and back again. I mocked, but it was everything one could hope for in cheap transportation and quite a bit more. It turns out, Volkswagen was shooting high. As Tony Quiroga [recalls for *Car & Driver*](https:\/\/www.caranddriver.com\/reviews\/a15129377\/volkswagen-jetta-review-2011-volkswagen-jetta-first-drive\/):\n\n> During the press launch of the outgoing Jetta back in 2005, Volkswagen touted that car as a less expensive alternative to an Acura TSX or Volvo S40. Volkswagen pointed to its growth in size, high-quality interior, new rear suspension, and refined demeanor as evidence that the Jetta had moved out of the Honda Civic and Toyota Corolla class.\n\nIn terms of **premium** compacts, my experience is quite limited, but it’s no wonder the company has struggled to find a place in the market for this product: in German, “Volkswagen Jetta” literally means “[people’s car jet stream](https:\/\/www.roadandtrack.com\/car-culture\/a24487598\/volkswagen-golf-jetta-passat-polo-name-origin\/).” The first component is infamous, of course, because of the Nazis and their [horrid Beetle](https:\/\/www.history.com\/this-day-in-history\/volkswagen-is-founded), but the second seems to be almost entirely unknown. In my research, I had to specifically investigate the Jetta’s name before reading anything about it. When an American thinks of “Jetta,” they unconsciously dissociate the word from the “jet” sound and make [largely unsophisticated jokes](https:\/\/carstereotypes.com\/car-stereotypes\/volkswagen-jetta-stereotypes\/). (It’s also *Regular Car Reviews*’ [most hated car](https:\/\/youtu.be\/2KZb545b4MU).) Now, the name has become a marque in and of itself: in China, Volkswagen [began selling several different models](https:\/\/www.volkswagen-newsroom.com\/en\/press-releases\/jetta-brand-successfully-launched-in-chinese-market-5647) under the JETTA brand last year. This also was news to me, and *I* try to keep up with the industry.\n\nIn 2011, the Mk. VI Jetta was [released](https:\/\/www.motortrend.com\/cars\/volkswagen\/jetta\/2011\/2011-volkswagen-jetta\/) with an outdated base, 115-hp powertrain and a “hard plastic [interior] that wouldn’t look out of place in a Chrysler Sebring.” (Quiroga insults, to clarify.) Compared to the Mk. V, “Volkswagen made it clear that the targets are once again the strong-selling Civic and Corolla.” Once again, I’m at a loss for experience in the equivalent extra-Volkswagen competition, save for the [Chevrolet Cruze](https:\/\/youtu.be\/40x4TF-6ggc) and Kia Forte. (Surprisingly, GM actually produced a diesel version of the Cruze and [*AutoGuide* compared it against the Jetta TDI](https:\/\/youtu.be\/dH-FZyKTY3s).) It’s been too long since I last drove my ex’s Mk. V to really have much to say, but I do remember a particular solidity about the steering – perhaps because it was still hydraulic. Once again, I’ll rely on Tony:\n\n> Less obvious cost cutting includes the loss of adjustability for the center armrest, a lack of lumbar adjustment in most models, no more power-reclining seatbacks, and a simpler stability-control program that can no longer be shut off or even reduced.\n\nWhen I began searching for my first ever truly modern car in February 2019, I surprisingly only needed to pass up a single option in the Kansas City area before I found The One: a 2014 post-[Dieselgate](https:\/\/youtu.be\/SvokGhOaHGg) example with ~65,000 miles on its odometer in “Deep Black Pearl” with a “Cornsilk Beige” interior which had been previously owned only by a single Michigan cyclist. I’d been without a car since dailying\/living in a [1976 Lincoln Continental](https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/p\/BiYABpKAJQX) the year before, in Portland, and my friend had driven me around everywhere in his Wrangler for a full month (thanks, Jack!) I’d walked around and cold-idled another, high-mileage Sportwagen, but I was committed to getting something with a light-colored interior after the red velvet cake Lincoln and my dank smoking room-dark XJR.\n\n![Martin Racing](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/HRE2hlh.jpg)\n\nThree of us walked into a dealership in the middle of a frigid Kansas afternoon – Jack, my girlfriend Sierra, and I. We hovered by a smart, gleaming little Golf GTI whilst my salesman, Charles, retrieved the car I had found online. After he finished copying my driver’s license while the little diesel warmed up, the four of us set off into suburban Lawrence. Back when the Mk. VI Golf was released, I attended a Volkswagen dealership event in which Mk. V and Mk. VI GTIs were driven back-to-back – I’m assuming to reassure buyers that yes, they *really had* made it better (though I was quite vocal in my disagreement about this, to the dealer’s chagrin.) The car I bought immediately reminded me more of the former – perhaps I just enjoy the increased body roll of a 50,000+ mile suspension – albeit with a much longer wheelbase and significantly more torque. Rowing through the gears, I was immediately impressed and bewildered by the characteristics of the 140-horsepower, 236 lb.-ft.-developing diesel powerplant. The diesel engines I grew up around in tractors, combines, and other heavy machinery were designed to more or less remain at a constant, relatively low RPM for the majority of their use cases. It’s not a screamer, but the idea that a diesel engine can *rev* at all was something that took a bit to wrap my head around. However, it is almost immediately evident that carrying on to the 6000 RPM (?) redline is a futile and incorrect practice. There is nothing at all to be found up there.\n\nI’ve driven some quick straight-line cars in my time, but none of them have delivered their power anything like the Jetta’s long-distinguished 2.0L inline-four. It’s very odd having comparatively so little actual horsepower, yet so much torque – I’d heard Jeremy Clarkson complain about diesel power coming in “great lumps,” but I’d already started to find them extremely (and positively) amusing in my first few minutes. When asked, the oil burner will produce protracted front tire squeal and torque steer from a stop, which is odd and hilarious coming from such an otherwise docile automobile. Also hilarious: Charles likely noted that Jack, Sierra, and I were (and are) entirely unafraid of facing The End when a very near collision during our test drive did not perturb us in the least, but left him huffing and puffing from adrenaline. He was a star, though, throughout the more than four hours of deliberations required for his institution to reckon with my credit history. Eventually, I ended up spending almost exactly $12,000, which was probably too much, and named my new automobile Martin - \"Marty\" for short - after Martin Winterkorn, the former CEO of Volkswagen AG who [bore more than his share of the blame](https:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2018-05-03\/ex-vw-ceo-winterkorn-charged-by-u-s-in-diesel-cheating-case) for Dieselgate, including [charges of fraud](https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2019\/4\/16\/18369528\/vw-ceo-martin-winterkorn-dieselgate-germany-volkswagen-emissions-scandal) by the German government. *Dirty diesel rolling coal in prison*.\n\n## Naughty Diesel\n\nBy \"post-Dieselgate,\" I mean that my new car was a part of [Volkwagen's $10 billion buyback program](https:\/\/www.caranddriver.com\/news\/a15344947\/whats-volkswagen-doing-with-all-those-repurchased-diesels\/), so the Michigander sold it back to the manufacturer for its \"fair replacement value\" - [between $12,500 and $44,000](https:\/\/www.caranddriver.com\/news\/a15347930\/volkswagen-settles-diesel-emissions-violations-for-14-7-billion-even-more-fines-to-come\/) according to *Car & Driver* on behalf of FTC chairwoman Edith Ramirez. To be technical, the powerplant is a 2.0L [EA189\/CJAA](https:\/\/www.motorreviewer.com\/engine.php?engine_id=43) turbodiesel four-cylinder. “The EA 189 was one of the most important engines in the company, destined not only for millions of Volkswagen-brand cars but also for a wide variety of other brands from the parent Volkswagen Group, like Audi, Skoda and Seat, as well as some light utility vehicles,” said [*The New York Times*](https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2015\/10\/05\/business\/engine-shortfall-pushed-volkswagen-to-evade-emissions-testing.html) regarding the “clean diesel” “scheme.” In original spec, 236 lb.-ft. of it arrived between 1750-2800 RPM, but my (admittedly, unscientific) perception indicates that post-update, the torque was coming a bit later. If I thought you were interested, I would attempt to detail [exactly what my car was then subjected to](https:\/\/www.caranddriver.com\/news\/a15351089\/volkswagen-details-fix-for-ea189-diesel-in-europe-but-itll-be-more-complex-for-u-s) by a dealer, but suffice it to say that it was made less fuel efficient and a bit less powerful, to my displeasure. For a complete and comprehensive video on the scandal, try [*Regular Car Reviews*](https:\/\/youtu.be\/SvokGhOaHGg). I’d also recommend the following reading from [*Jalopnik*](https:\/\/jalopnik.com\/your-guide-to-dieselgate-volkswagens-diesel-cheating-c-1731857018), [*The Verge*](https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2018\/10\/2\/17928314\/audi-ceo-rupert-stadler-fired-volkswagen-dieselgate), [*The New York Times*](https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2019\/04\/15\/business\/winterkorn-volkswagen-emissions-scandal.html), and [*The Independent*](https:\/\/www.independent.co.uk\/news\/business\/news\/volkswagen-ceo-martin-winterkorn-fraud-charges-germany-a8870541.html).\n\n![Martin and Locomotive](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/jfgT5Qu.jpg)\n\nMy own views on Dieselgate are entirely irrelevant, but I will note that buying back a buyback car for such a price felt like a favor to my dealer and that it’s pretty cool to have my own copy of [VW’s Extended Emissions Warranty Notice](https:\/\/www.vwdiesellookup.com\/pdf\/VWCourtSettlement_Emissions_Disclosure_Gen2_Automatic_Final.pdf), not to mention the fact that I actually made use of it (which I will discuss later.) From my perspective, the automotive industry is *the* most heavily-regulated business space in the world and I’d suggest a company like the Volkswagen Group feeling like they should cheat on emissions testing might indicate that the standards of the test could be unreasonable and\/or unrealistic.\n\nAfter returning from almost two hellish, extremely confusing years in Portland taking public transport, Martin became a vehicle for a rediscovery and newfound appreciation for my Missouri home – the great Missouri River, especially. Not since owning my Miata had I driven so much in the country. Sierra and I [visited Cooper’s Landing](https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/p\/BuP3y62laon\/) in the wet and ventured down to Springfield, Missouri (very far South,) near which we discovered [Hodges Speedway](https:\/\/dieselgoth.com\/race-day-at-hodges) – a [then-abandoned dirt oval](https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/AsphaltApostle\/videos\/10218812861450693) surrounded by demolition derby casualties and the large trucks used to haul them around.\n\n![Martin Hiding](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/Yjq0MbT.jpg)\n\nSomewhere North of Kansas City, I opened the taps all the way on a very long straight and reached 125mph, which is either the aerodynamic VMax, an electronically limited limit, or both. Surprisingly, the modern People’s Car feels quite stable at this speed – were it not my own automobile, I’m not sure I wouldn’t just travel this fast everywhere. In the past few years, Interstate 70 – which cuts Missouri just about in half from West-East, connecting St. Louis and Kansas City with my hometown in the center – has become significantly faster-paced than I remembered it before moving to Portland for two years. 80mph used to be the accepted number, 70 (the actual speed limit) was the unenforced minimum. In my old Toyota pickup, I could travel at 65 without attracting too much criticism. *Now*, however, one must maintain 85 to keep up with traffic, especially when traveling with commuters. 90-95 will no longer garner judgmental looks and 100mph left-laners are given a pass.\n\n“I’ll bet that’s great on the highway” is probably the most regular comment received from passersby and riders right after “is this a diesel!?” (Really, the fact of my Jetta’s existence as a manual-equipped diesel wagon seemed to utterly astound a great many people.) There is truth in this general supposition: the ability of the diesel powerplant to deliver hill-climbing torque at low RPM is simply unmatched by gasoline powerplants of the same displacement, which means that “highway” driving entails virtually zero downshifting – arrive in sixth gear, set the cruise control, take a nap. Everything else is taken care of. There is a definite luxury in the knowledge that one is no longer needed in the process at speed – luxury that is NOT present in a gasoline-to-manual Jetta drivetrain. From [*Hackaday*](https:\/\/hackaday.com\/2019\/09\/26\/the-future-of-diesel-is-on-shaky-ground\/):\n\n> [Diesel] has a higher volumetric energy density than gasoline, and thanks to low volatility, diesel engines can run at significantly higher compression ratios without risking detonation. These benefits allow diesel engines to produce significantly more torque than similarly sized gasoline engines.\n\n![Fat Martin](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/58ZyiRO.jpg)\n\n“Diesel engines are typically poor when it comes to power to weight ratio, as their high compression ratio and torque output demands heavier materials in their construction,” notes Lewin Day, meaning *steel* engine block. Here we arrive on my singular dissatisfaction with the Jetta: **its weight**. While traveling from Kansas City back home in the East one day, I decided to satisfy a longtime bucketlist item and stop by a weigh station. As I drove up to the scale, the police-uniformed attendant looked up at me from his glass box and gave [the standard white guy smile frown](https:\/\/twitter.com\/rashadpls\/status\/650114296937058304). It took a moment for the scale to register Martin, but it eventually displayed a whole **3440** **lbs**. My little “compact” wagon… weighed significantly more than one and three-quarter tons – just 528 lbs. less than the [full-sized, supercharged V8-powered Jaguar saloon car](https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/p\/BJPe6rWAcnr\/) I call the automotive love of my life, and almost a full 200 lbs. more than [its GLI sedan sibling](https:\/\/www.caranddriver.com\/reviews\/a15129379\/2011-volkswagen-jetta-gli-20-tsi-review\/). There was one single advantage to this weight: we were able to use Martin as a ballast to help [re-spool the winch cable on Jack’s Wrangler](https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/tv\/BwBEetwlUEF).\n\nAfter discovering this figure, I did what I could to diminish the weight easily without tearing into the seats or removing some of the car’s *fourteen* airbags. Upon lifting up the base of the “car-go” area in the rear, I found a *full* steel spare wheel – some 30 lbs of it at least – which I immediately removed, along with some sort of flapping cargo restraint that I can only suspect was designed to keep objects (like dogs, perhaps) in the cargo area from sailing into the passenger compartment during an accident (it’s called the “luggage compartment cover” in the [owner’s manual](https:\/\/eileenlong-my.sharepoint.com\/:b:\/g\/personal\/david_eileenlonglcsw_com\/Ecdms0tdr6dBoMWScrKX8PsBkIJMmYNjOfzFX3oy-UUO-A).) Ideally, I intended to one day strip out all of the interior except for the driver’s side chair, but it ‘twas not intended to be.\n\nAfter driving the Jetta for about a week, I was on the short commute back home from the office when I noticed that the cooling fans were running at what sounded like maximum capacity. Then, at a red light, I felt some rough dips in the engine’s idle. When I reached home minutes later, I turned off the ignition and removed the key only to find the fans still spooling. I was convinced I had already broken the car somehow in rough driving, but in reality, Marty was in the process of [Diesel Particulate Filter (DPF) Regeneration](https:\/\/dieselnet.com\/tech\/dpf_regen.php) – a procedure designed to clean the little shitpot under the hood by heating it up some thousands of degrees to burn off built up diesel exhaust soot. At least, this is the way I understand it.\n\nOtherwise, I disagree with most reviews about the “diesel rumble” being bothersome. Perhaps it’s because this is by far the most modern car I’ve ever spent this much time with – the *only* car I’ve ever spent so much consecutive time with, in fact – or because I did, indeed, grow up sitting (and standing) right next to 8-liter turbodiesels at full chat for hours on end. Compared to my mother’s 1.4L gasoline-powered Mk. VII sedan at idle in her garage, there is a more pronounced clacking, but it’s nothing you’d have any trouble sleeping through. I would know! Whilst driving for Uber and Lyft through one of the [warmest summers on record](https:\/\/www.therolladailynews.com\/news\/20190926\/second-hottest-august-ever-wettest-january-to-august-on-record), I idled away many hours parked on the street with the (averagely effective) air-conditioning on. I idled when I wasn’t online, too – I would even go as far as to say that I made idling one of the trendiest activities of Summer 2019. \n\n> What’re you up to man?\n> Nothin’ much yo. Just over here idling.\n\n## Ridesharing\n\nFor more than six months, my primary income was from Uber and Lyft driving around Columbia, MO – a distinctly academically-dominated demographic. Frankly, I can’t think of any vehicle more suited to what ridesharing actually entails than a diesel Jetta wagon. It’s a relatively spacious and comfortable place to be for four adults – certainly when no trip lasts longer than thirty minutes – with a ridiculously stout cargo capacity. I was able to fit *9* freshman fraternity guys in for a short trip once. Their faces were all genuinely somber as one expressed “it’s really hard having 8 friends when we try to go out.” (No, you’re not supposed to accept those rides.) It was a challenge carrying some 1500 lbs. of Sad Boys, mostly for the brakes. Once, a group of young men and women began to make fun after noticing the DIESELGEEK decal I’d stuck on my side’s rear quarter window (which I’d acquired with a new [shifter bushing kit](https:\/\/www.dieselgeek.com\/products\/high-performance-vw-shifter-shaft-bushings-for-mk4-golf-jetta-new-beetle?variant=6292541866027).) “So are you a diesel geek?” they asked, jeering to themselves, to which I responded: “you know, it’s so weird you mention that because I know this place that sells these stickers…” They no longer seemed amused.\n\nAll of the cars I’ve owned have been attention-grabbing in their own way – my old Toyota pickup was adored by the locals; my Miata was adored by other Miata owners. My XJR was gorgeous and my Swamp Continental seemed to be passionately coveted by absolutely everyone over 40. With the Jetta, though, I did not expect any unusual attention whatsoever, yet I must confess that more conversations were started about it than of all of the others, combined. Ridesharing will do that, yes, but it is ridiculous how many people of all races, classes, and ages were enamored by – or overly curious about – Martin.\n\n> What is this a Jetta, dude? Is this a Jetta? Whoa! Dude, is this a stickshift!? Dude I think this is a stickshift. BRO. I can’t believe you’re driving a stick right now. He’s driving a stickshift car! Wow I think this is a manual car! Oh shit this is a **diesel**!? It’s a diesel too?! No way! I can’t believe you’re out here driving a diesel Jetta wagon bro. Is this a stickshift? You can drive stick!?\n\nNo.\n\nEarly one morning, a ride was requested from the local news station just out of town – a fascinating place. News vans parked in a converted horse stable. They farm televisions out there. A few minutes into the ride, after picking up the young woman, I noticed in the rearview mirror out of my eye’s corner that she had put down her phone to watch my right hand with total bewilderment. Eventually, she asked “what are you doing to the car?” She’d never heard of a manual transmission before. I did my best to explain, but when she asked “but why wouldn’t you just buy a regular car?” I did not have a sufficient answer. Unlike many automotive enthusiasts, I think it’s totally okay that people are allowed to exist independent of this knowledge. There are many, many other things in life to worry about. [80% of cars sold in the United States](https:\/\/dieselgoth.com\/automatic-transmission-inefficiency) are shipped with automatics and expecting every young person who lives in an urban environment to think about automobiles as anything beyond simple transportation is asking a lot.\n\nWhile we’re on the topic of manual transmissions, it’s relevant to mention how excellent the Jetta TDI is as a vehicle to teach first timers how to operate one. With the clutch in, the engine will not rev beyond 3500 RPM thanks to an electronic limiter, which dramatically reduces the number of obligatory stalls when learning clutch control. The learner can simply hold the accelerator to the floor as they get the hang of declutching instead of having to receive shouts of “more gas!” repeatedly. Of course, being a diesel further eases those stresses with much more readily available torque. Sierra was able to grasp the basics this way in a *single night*, which is unprecedented in my experience. She found particular comfort in the suggested gear indicator on the instrument panel’s main information display, which is very conservative, naturally, but also apparently relief from some great anxiety regarding the question *which gear should I be in right now*?\n\n## Community\n\nI have derided Facebook for my entire adult life for its shitty design, inaspirational effect on its users, and its massive intellectual power, but strangely, through Jetta ownership, I was able to find a community on the service that couldn’t be found elsewhere. Groups like [TDI Scumbags](https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/groups\/173989949914106), [VW TDI Owners](https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/groups\/24097854515), [VW TDI support group](https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/groups\/1088169071220271), and [VW TDI Owners Performance and Tech Talk](https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/groups\/2501785479863909) are full of absolutely hilarious and insightful content that I’m genuinely glad I didn’t miss.\n\n<iframe src=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/plugins\/video.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fmatthew.mccabe.37%2Fvideos%2F2633421440027527%2F&show_text=0&width=238\" width=\"238\" height=\"476\" style=\"border:none;overflow:hidden\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowTransparency=\"true\" allowFullScreen=\"true\"><\/iframe>\n\nOn Instagram, I found [@jp_eurogarage’s Mk.

I especially love [its idle](https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/p\/Bp-LXMbFNza\/). @projectownersclub [posted a video](https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/p\/BrddAqWHpBZ\/) in December, 2018 of a *very* rusty diesel Mk. III with a straight vertical stack spewing smoke all over its owner’s yard. A video was shared on one of my Facebook groups captioned “[when you only drive manual](https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/watch\/?v=448084355761412)” in which a very generic-looking white man with moustache finds himself gagging in a car with a traditional automatic transmission. The wholesomeness of these posts is often adorable, and not only on Facebook. [*VW Vortex*](https:\/\/www.vwvortex.com) is an active and helpful forum\/blog for TDI owners that I found to be invaluable when researching modifications.\n\n<pre style=\"width:300px;padding:0px;margin:0 auto;overflow:hidden;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wheelwell.com\/austin-cabot\/im7\/2014-volkswagen-jetta-sportwagen?utm_source=vehicle_embed_widget&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=vehicle_detail_page\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"text-decoration:none;\"><aside style=\"color:#FFF;font-family:HelveticaNeue-Light,Helvetica,Arial;background-image:linear-gradient(to bottom,rgba(0,0,0,0),rgba(0,0,0,.3),#000000),url('https:\/\/statics.wheelwell.com\/u\/2bea4141-49c4-4e91-a300-e2de56f973fe.large.jpg');background-repeat:no-repeat;background-size:cover;background-position:center;box-sizing:border-box;height:200px;width:300px;padding:12px;border-radius:3px;margin:0 auto;text-align:left;display:inline-block;\"><img src=\"http:\/\/d2yobvf5u8yliy.cloudfront.net\/357e0360-26fd-46a9-b96e-7bcf3bbffd3c.png\" alt=\"Wheelwell, Inc\" title=\"Wheelwell, Inc\" style=\"height:23px;float:right;outline:none;border:0;\"><div style=\"padding:115px 0px 10px 0px;\"><span style=\"font-size:20px;font-weight:600;letter-spacing:1px;display:block;\">2014 Volkswagen Jetta SportWagen<\/span><\/div><div style=\"width:100%;display:flex;\"><div style=\"display:inline-block;width:45%;\"><div style=\"display:inline-block;vertical-align:top;\"><img src=\"http:\/\/d2yobvf5u8yliy.cloudfront.net\/2ce66dca-9ecc-4d13-a723-e20ac3662560.png\" style=\"height:30px;position:relative;top:-4px;outline:none;border:0;\" alt=\"wheelwell horsepower icon\" title=\"wheelwell horsepower\" nopin=\"nopin\" ondragstart=\"return false;\" onselectstart=\"return false;\" oncontextmenu=\"return false;\"><\/div><div style=\"display:inline-block;vertical-align:top;margin-left:4px;\"><span style=\"color:#8EB8DE;font-size:14px;font-weight:600;letter-spacing:1px;line-height:16px;display:block;\">140<\/span><span style=\"font-size:8px;letter-spacing:0.8px;line-height:7px;display:block;\">HORSEPOWER<\/span><\/div><\/div><div style=\"display:inline-block;width:45%;height:50px;\"><div style=\"display:inline-block;vertical-align:top;\"><img src=\"http:\/\/d2yobvf5u8yliy.cloudfront.net\/eee11a3a-e76d-43fb-9289-f8421ac8d8af.png\" style=\"height:26px;outline:none;border:0;\" alt=\"wheelwell torque icon\" title=\"wheelwell torque\"><\/div><div style=\"display:inline-block;vertical-align:top;margin-left:5px;\"><span style=\"color:#8EB8DE;font-size:14px;font-weight:600;letter-spacing:1px;line-height:16px;display:block;\">236<\/span><span style=\"font-size:8px;letter-spacing:0.8px;line-height:7px;display:block;\">TORQUE FT-LB<\/span><\/div><\/div><div style=\"display:inline-block;width:25%;\"><div style=\"display:inline-block;vertical-align:top;\"><img src=\"http:\/\/d2yobvf5u8yliy.cloudfront.net\/6044d824-48c2-480e-800b-d78fd17c4080.png\" style=\"height:24px;outline:none;border:0;\" alt=\"wheelwell mods icon\" title=\"wheelwell mods\"><\/div><div style=\"display:inline-block;vertical-align:top;margin-left:5px;\"><span style=\"color:#8EB8DE;font-size:14px;font-weight:600;letter-spacing:1px;line-height:16px;display:block;\">13<\/span><span style=\"font-size:8px;letter-spacing:0.8px;line-height:7px;display:block;\">MODS<\/span><\/div><\/div><\/div><\/aside><\/a><\/pre>\n\n## Performance\n\nFor the first time in my personal automotive history, I felt the desire to modify one of my own cars. Perhaps the most famous appearance of the Jetta Sportwagen in The Web Era was driving instructor Austin Cabot’s 2014 Sportwagen in [one of Matt Farah’s infamous *One-Take*s](https:\/\/youtu.be\/x3HwWn55MJY). You can find the full list of modifications on [the car’s *WheelWell* page](https:\/\/www.wheelwell.com\/austin-cabot\/im7\/2014-volkswagen-jetta-sportwagen). I intended to emulate Austin with a few modifications including Dieselgeek’s [Sigma 6 shortshift kit](https:\/\/www.dieselgeek.com\/collections\/vw-short-shifters\/products\/sigma-6-six-speed-short-shift-kit-for-vw) and “high performance” [shifter bushing kit](https:\/\/www.dieselgeek.com\/products\/high-performance-vw-shifter-shaft-bushings-for-mk4-golf-jetta-new-beetle?variant=6292541866027) (which I did get around to buying, but never installed.) For those interested in engine\/ECU tuning, Malone Tuning has a [beautiful tool](https:\/\/malonetuning.com\/ecu-tuning\/VW\/2014\/Jetta\/2.0L-CR-TDI-CJAA-EA189-2012-2014\/Stock) to help you customize your order.\n\n![Malone Tuning Stage 2](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/uApnhy4.png)\n\nInstead of installing the shortshift kit right away, I decided to splurge on a bespoke [Raceseng Ashiko weighted shift knob](https:\/\/www.ecstuning.com\/b-raceseng-parts\/ashiko-shift-knob-red-texture-no-engraving-vw-audi-adapter\/08311421~rsg), which made throws immediately better. The issue these products are combatting is the particularly disconnected gearshift which Volkswagen has been notorious for the past few decades. The best way I can describe it is that it feels like you’re just operating a lever instead of shifting a transmission, if that makes sense.\n\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet tw-align-center\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">got that <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/raceseng?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@raceseng<\/a> knob. feels immensely better even pre-short shift kit.

I also “[deleted](https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/tv\/ByJ3-u4luhV65nfvVjZ94z00WOTjImro12LtXw0\/)” (removed, in other words) the (likely) faux-leather shift boot after realizing that I’ve always hated the sound and sensation of them, but hadn’t been willing to modify my previous cars in *any* way. It sounds ridiculous, but it’s actually quite personally noteworthy that I was able to traverse the unseen boundary into *mod culture*. The result was a slightly more mechanical-feeling shift that would’ve certainly been [vastly improved](https:\/\/youtu.be\/Rh02yxy9SbE) by installation of Dieselgeek’s kit.\n\n<iframe width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/PVJJ8pcHegg?controls=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe>\n\nAnother aspirational goal of mine for Martin: [H&R’s Sport Springs Set](https:\/\/www.ecstuning.com\/b-h-and-r-parts\/sport-springs-set\/54751\/) paired with a set of [Firestone Firehawk Indy 500s](https:\/\/www.tirerack.com\/tires\/tires.jsp?tireMake=Firestone&tireModel=Firehawk+Indy+500&partnum=055WR6FHI5&autoMake=Volkswagen&autoModel=Jetta+Sportwagen&autoYear=2014&autoModClar=TDI). The goal was to sure up some of that body roll and torque-induced wheelspin. I suspect the result would’ve been a very, very sticky Martin. Unfortunately, I would not get the chance before I killed him in an accident on December 22nd of last year.\n\n### Efficiency\n\nAverage: **29.84** mpg\nTotal Gallons Pumped: **644**\nTotal Spent: $**1726.94**\nTotal Miles Driven: **19506**\n\nAccording to my [fuel logs](https:\/\/eileenlong-my.sharepoint.com\/:x:\/g\/personal\/david_eileenlonglcsw_com\/EbMIF1pW62JDu3pb4NnCzZoBg_FWIzo_Z48lyGM9oi-VSA), (they are public, yes, though not necessarily 100% complete,) I averaged close to 30 mpg over 78 fillups and just over 19500 miles. Considering that I was ridesharing most of that time and driving quite obnoxiously for all of it, you should be very impressed. “Diesels tend to get about 30-percent better fuel economy than their conventional counterparts,” says *Consumer Reports* in a [comparison between diesels and hybrids](https:\/\/www.consumerreports.org\/cro\/news\/2013\/10\/diesel-offer-great-highway-fuel-economy\/index.htm) dating back to 2013. From the [*Union of Concerned Scientists*](https:\/\/blog.ucsusa.org\/dave-cooke\/diesel-vs-hybrid-cost-benefits-410):\n\n> Much of the reason for diesel vehicle’s high fuel economy has to do with the diesel combustion process; however, some of the increase in fuel economy is due to the simple fact that a gallon of diesel fuel contains more energy than a gallon of gasoline.\n\nThe joy my Sportwagen brought me was not expected. My plan to make myself a more reasonable person (and driver) by buying a “boring” car was obviously foiled by the diesel’s torque, the community’s dynamism, and my own communion with mod culture. I spent more consecutive time driving the Jetta than I have in any other automobile and was able to truly enjoy it. After my experience owning a diesel-powered Volkswagen, I would very much like to try driving\/owning the [Golf GDI](https:\/\/www.topgear.com\/car-reviews\/volkswagen\/golfgolf-sv\/20-tdi-184-gtd-5dr\/first-drive) – a performance-oriented diesel version of their excellent hatch. Truthfully – given the way I killed Martin – I did not deserve his kinship, but I’m certainly grateful I had the experience.\n\n🗎 [**Print\/PDF**](https:\/\/eileenlong-my.sharepoint.com\/:b:\/g\/personal\/david_eileenlonglcsw_com\/EW3g_XA6ZexLqBnSB2z5QzcB9sXgwtP_n6iAyBUVZ_aLCA?e=ImbC3f)\n\n#auto","views":539,"updated":"2020-05-13T20:28:59Z","tags":["8EB8DE","auto","FFF"],"type":null,"title":"Kinship of the Jetta, Deserving","slug":"kinship-of-the-jetta-deserving","appearance":"norm","language":"en","rtl":false,"created":"2020-05-13T19:00:00Z","images":["https:\/\/i.snap.as\/58ZyiRO.jpg","https:\/\/statics.wheelwell.com\/u\/2bea4141-49c4-4e91-a300-e2de56f973fe.large.jpg","http:\/\/d2yobvf5u8yliy.cloudfront.net\/357e0360-26fd-46a9-b96e-7bcf3bbffd3c.png","https:\/\/i.snap.as\/uApnhy4.png","https:\/\/i.snap.as\/qW5VDLj.jpg","https:\/\/i.snap.as\/HRE2hlh.jpg","https:\/\/i.snap.as\/Yjq0MbT.jpg","http:\/\/d2yobvf5u8yliy.cloudfront.net\/6044d824-48c2-480e-800b-d78fd17c4080.png","https:\/\/i.snap.as\/jfgT5Qu.jpg","http:\/\/d2yobvf5u8yliy.cloudfront.net\/2ce66dca-9ecc-4d13-a723-e20ac3662560.png","http:\/\/d2yobvf5u8yliy.cloudfront.net\/eee11a3a-e76d-43fb-9289-f8421ac8d8af.png"],"paid":false},{"id":"xpth7chp2ir44dhh","body":"![ZalgoGeneratoriOSIcon](https:\/\/user-images.githubusercontent.com\/43663476\/153723816-87f1bba5-c81f-4816-84f3-b34ec38f3acf.png)\n\n## A powerful iOS utility for fucking digital text with ruthless efficiency.\n\n<!--more-->\n\n<audio controls>\n  <source src=\"http:\/\/davidblue.wtf\/audio\/zalgogenerator.caf\">\n<\/audio>\n\nA warning siren sounds louder still for the current state of the *Digital Divide* than the profoundly ignorant spectacle of Mark Zuckerberg’s drooling, ghoulish interrogators last year from the digital hole of none other than [W3School’s trusty web validator](https:\/\/validator.w3.org), which would surely be rated as the Most Anxious Being in History if it were to acquire sentience.

I thought I'd add my [End User](https:\/\/anchor.fm\/davidblue) commentary to the mix. Sorry. My first event was called \"Every developer is welcome, with Scott Hanselman and guests.\" Hanselman is listed as a [blogger](https:\/\/www.hanselman.com\/) and [podcaster](http:\/\/hanselminutes.com) living (of course) in Portland. I'm not a \"real\" developer, but I know what Microsoft Teams is, and I recognized the event as a desktop screenshare of his calls with different Microsoft employees. There was a [child invasion](https:\/\/twitter.com\/JuanKRuiz\/status\/1262789374128816128) and a dropped phone. I also noticed the icon for the [\"new\" Microsoft Edge](https:\/\/www.zdnet.com\/article\/meet-the-new-microsoft-edge-your-move-google\/) browser in his taskbar and realized that I hadn't downloaded it yet. I remedied that for the conference's sake - I thought it only appropriate that I try to use as much Microsoft software as possible in this context. I also installed the new [PowerTools Run preview](https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2020\/5\/19\/21262060\/microsoft-windows-10-launcher-powertoy-spotlight-alfred-download-build) which I mentioned in my [tips post](https:\/\/bilge.world\/poweruser-tips-software-shortcuts).\n\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet tw-align-center\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Epic <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/shanselman?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@shanselman<\/a> moment! awesome, glad to share our new realities.

As [reported by *The Verge*](https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2020\/5\/19\/21260005\/microsoft-office-fluid-web-document-features-build), [Microsoft Fluid](https:\/\/eileenlong-my.sharepoint.com\/:u:\/g\/personal\/david_eileenlonglcsw_com\/EXd7qVaXqRlHlnnllT7_A5gBRw-ypXkANGTIWlzEPlLzQA?e=PrLfh6) is going to change a lot:\n\n> Microsoft’s Fluid Framework sounds a lot like Google Docs, but it’s actually Google Docs on steroids. Microsoft is so confident it has built the future of productivity, it’s now open-sourcing its Fluid Framework so the rest of the world can help shape what it has created.\n\nThere's also [Microsoft Lists](https:\/\/www.engadget.com\/microsoft-lists-150002899.html), which is reportedly going to revolutionize SharePoint Lists into something more modern and useful:\n\n> It builds off the [existing feature in SharePoint](https:\/\/support.office.com\/en-us\/article\/what-is-a-list-in-sharepoint-93262a88-20ad-4edc-8410-b6909b2f59a5), and will let you track progress and data to organize your teams, potentially making the company’s offerings more streamlined and productive.\n\n![Microsoft PowerToys Run](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/XmboQGr.png)\n\n## Microsoft Edge Chromium\n\nAs an Office 365 administrator, I basically only use Edge for administrative\/management tasks. Otherwise, I can't imagine a reason to use it over Firefox, Brave, Vivaldi, Chrome, Opera, etc, but I thought I'd give the \"new\" (as of January) Edge a tryout for your sake and make it my default browser for a day as well as Microsoft's Bing search engine. There's also news specific to Build: [Edge is integrating with Pinterest](https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/05\/19\/microsoft-edge-gets-a-pinterest-integration-sidebar-search-and-automatic-profile-switching\/), of all things:\n\n> Now, Edge will feature a Pinterest-powered tool that will show suggestions from Pinterest at the bottom of a collection. Clicking on that, Microsoft says, will take users to a Pinterest board “of similar, trending Pins so users can quickly find and add ideas relevant to their collection.” Users will also be able to export collections to Pinterest.\n\nI'm in no position to \"test\" a browser, but the new Edge is noticeably faster at rendering pages and much *much* smoother when navigating between tabs\/preference windows. It looks much more like Chrome, which makes sense. Perhaps because my install is absent of third-party extensions, opening new tabs and windows was much faster than my other browsers. I recorded a [~2 minute demo](https:\/\/vimeo.com\/420430704) of normal browsing on [my Surface Laptop 2](https:\/\/extratone.com\/microsoft-surface-laptop-2-review-windows-future).\n\n<iframe src=\"https:\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/420430704\" width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe>\n\nIn terms of touch support, Edge remains the only acceptable browser on Windows 10. If you've spent money on a new PC recently, chances are your device is touch-enabled. If you're like me, you've already [disabled it](https:\/\/support.microsoft.com\/en-us\/help\/4028019\/windows-enable-and-disable-your-touchscreen-in-windows-10). If not, you'll find scrolling and navigation in Edge have improved tremendously - it's like an entirely new browser [because it is](https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2019\/5\/6\/18527550\/microsoft-chromium-edge-google-history-collaboration).\n\n> Because Edge used a different rendering engine than Chrome or Safari, it meant that it would sometimes have problems on websites. Testing a website against multiple browsers has always been difficult, and because Edge had so little uptake, it meant optimizing for it often fell off the priority list for web developers.\n\nI really like how easy it is to mute audio from tabs and how much better [my CMS](https:\/\/write.as) is rendered. I still prefer Firefox's method of tab switching (by last-used chronologically instead of in the order presented.) The reader view is smoother than its competitors and offers a beautiful selection of themes as well as the best \"Read aloud\" feature in the business.\n\n![Microsoft Edge Reader View](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/jWqG85f.png)\n\nI'm not going to quote you measurements - check out [*Computerworld*'s browser review](https:\/\/www.computerworld.com\/article\/3513973\/microsofts-new-edge-browser-third-times-the-charm.html) for that - but I can say that Edge Chromium is using more RAM than Firefox but a bit less than Chrome. [Office.com](http:\/\/office.com) also looks and works incredibly well. Overall, I'm extremely impressed with Edge Chromium and the improvements to Bing. As of my experiences today, it's the fastest and smoothest web browser I have, which is a complete flip from that of the old Edge.\n\n---\n\n## Further Reading\n\n* \"[Microsoft Edge is getting a new sidebar search feature and Pinterest integration](https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2020\/5\/19\/21262098\/microsoft-edge-sidebar-search-pinterest-integration-features)\" | *The Verge*\n* \"[Microsoft’s new Edge Chromium browser launches on Windows and macOS](https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2020\/1\/15\/21066767\/microsoft-edge-chromium-new-browser-windows-mac-download-os)\" | *The Verge*\n* \"[Browser review: Microsoft’s new “Edgium” Chromium-based Edge](https:\/\/arstechnica.com\/gadgets\/2020\/01\/browser-review-microsofts-new-edgium-chromium-based-edge\/)\" | *Ars Technica*\n* \"[Microsoft Edge Chromium is already a viable alternative to Chrome and Firefox](https:\/\/www.androidauthority.com\/microsoft-edge-chromium-review-1065152\/)\" | *Android Authority*\n* \"[Microsoft’s Fluid Framework is now open source, comes to Office 365](https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/05\/19\/microsofts-fluid-framework-is-now-open-source-comes-to-office-365\/)\" | *TechCrunch*\n* \"[Microsoft is bringing Linux GUI apps to Windows 10](https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2020\/5\/19\/21263377\/microsoft-windows-10-linux-gui-apps-gpu-acceleration-wsl-features)\" | *The Verge*\n* \"[Microsoft: we were wrong about open source](https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2020\/5\/18\/21262103\/microsoft-open-source-linux-history-wrong-statement)\" | *The Verge*\n* \"[Microsoft Lists is a new app designed for Teams, SharePoint, and Outlook](https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2020\/5\/19\/21263400\/microsoft-lists-app-sharepoint-teams-outlook-integration-web-app-build)\" | *The Verge*\n* \"[Windows 10 Is Getting Its Own Built-In Package Manager](https:\/\/www.thurrott.com\/windows\/windows-10\/236301\/windows-10-is-getting-its-own-built-in-package-manager)\" | *Thurrott*\n* \"[Microsoft Build 2020, Summarised](https:\/\/www.thurrott.com\/microsoft\/236331\/microsoft-build-2020-summarised)\" | *Thurrott*\n* \"[Microsoft 365 (formerly Office 365) for business: Everything you need to know](https:\/\/www.zdnet.com\/article\/microsoft-office-365-for-business-everything-you-need-to-know\/#ftag=CAD-00-10aag7e)\" | *ZDNet*\n* \"[Microsoft Build Looks Very Different This Year](https:\/\/www.wired.com\/story\/microsoft-build-2020\/)\" | *Wired*\n* \"[Why Cortana won't be at Microsoft Build](https:\/\/www.pcworld.com\/article\/3543765\/why-cortana-wont-be-at-microsoft-build.html)\" | *PC World*\n\n#software","views":1165,"updated":"2022-04-04T07:58:52Z","tags":["MSBuild2020","BUILD2020","software"],"type":null,"title":"Microsoft Build 2020 in Dogs","slug":"microsoft-build-2020-edge-browser","appearance":"norm","language":"en","rtl":false,"created":"2020-05-19T22:21:33Z","images":["https:\/\/i.snap.as\/oDUqtqe.png","https:\/\/i.snap.as\/XmboQGr.png","https:\/\/i.snap.as\/jWqG85f.png"],"collection":{"public":false,"alias":"bilge","total_posts":0,"title":"The Psalms","verification_link":"","description":"A <a href=\"https:\/\/davidblue.wtf\/db.vcf\">narcoleptic yokel<\/a> on software and culture.","style_sheet":"","views":177027,"monetization_pointer":""},"paid":false},{"id":"14aeg7ze86l1n6k3","body":"![End User Art](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/H5OwW8O.jpg)\n\n## Sitting in my car, talking to my phone, looking beyond tech media and industry personalities to find the individuals and organizations who continue to prioritize progress.\n\n<iframe src=\"https:\/\/www.listennotes.com\/podcasts\/end-user\/the-radical-minutia-_yHKGXDQfzJ\/embed\/\" height=\"180px\" width=\"100%\" style=\"width: 1px;

There is simply too much to say about one of the most emotionally effective, surreal films of my childhood. *The Langoliers* occupied 9-11PM's slot on ABC for May 14th and 15th, 1995 (Sunday and Monday, twenty-five years ago.) It's an adaptation of a [Stephen King novel](https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Langoliers-Stephen-King\/dp\/1982136057) of the same title and is fairly widely-regarded as [the worst such adaptation](https:\/\/letterboxd.com\/yojrb\/film\/the-langoliers\/) of all time. You can now watch the whole three hours of *The Langoliers* in 360p (supposedly) at your leisure [thanks to OpenTube](https:\/\/open.tube\/videos\/watch\/397129b2-25fc-49c0-a802-881c5dad5b06?title=0&warningTitle=0&controls=0) (for now.) One commenter (on the since-taken-down YouTube video) echoes what I'm about to tell you: \"My god! I thought I dreamed this movie up as a kid. I have been trying to describe this to people for years and here it is, it’s real!\" In order to write this, I joined the [Stephen King Wiki Discord server](https:\/\/discord.gg\/X3bAngj) and was immediately welcomed with a request not to type in the text channels: \"I’m working on adding some new channels so pls nobody type in them til I’m done.\"\n\n<iframe width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" sandbox=\"allow-same-origin allow-scripts\" src=\"https:\/\/open.tube\/videos\/embed\/397129b2-25fc-49c0-a802-881c5dad5b06?title=0&warningTitle=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe>\n\n*The Langoliers* begins with a pissed-off British secret agent (Mark Lindsay Chapman,) an insane businessman (Bronson Pinchot,) a psychic, vision-impaired young woman (Kate Maberly,) Sarah Jessica Parker (Patricia Wettig,) and a *just*-widowed pilot (David Morse) all boarding the same redeye flight to Boston - American Pride Flight 29. This group falls asleep and mysteriously wakes up alone on the aircraft except for Stephen King himself (Dean Stockwell,) a stupid incel violinist (Christopher Collet,) and a stoner (Kimber Riddle.) My favorite character, Craig Toomey, is the \"twerp\" business boy with daddy issues who can't stop himself from demanding to know what's going on. James Bond shuts him up with a \"nose hold.\"\n\n> Whoa. No one's driving the plane!\n\nDavid Morse proceeds to try and contact air traffic control in a fairly-realistic manner, but is unable to receieve any radio signals at all, even from Strategic Air Command. Frankie Faison plays the single person of color on the flight, Don Gaffney - \"a tool and die worker for Hughes Aircraft\" - who dies first, of course. James Bond lecures David about inciting panic and almost immediately reveals his secret identity. Then, the Hungry Idiot (Baxter Harris) wakes up whilst Toomey begins screaming again.\n\n> Scaring the little girl? Scaring the little girl?! Lady, we're diverting to some tin-pot airport in the middle of nowhere, and I've got better things to think about than scaring the little girl!\n\nAfter the entirety of the male cast threatens to beat him up, Toomey, sweating his balls off, begins slowly tearing strips of paper and moaning sexually like an absolute madman. Some irritiatingly irrelevant dialogue insues in which Stephen King Author Man narrates through Sherlock Holmes deduction to figure absolutely nothing out. He is wearing stripes on plaid. He suggests that the entire situation could be some sort of government experiment and I can't believe I'm wasting your time with this. \"If it were just this plane, I could give you a scenario, but unfortunately, it's not just this plane. The city of Denver is probably still down there, but all its lights were off if it was.\" Here you can see how excellently [this script](https:\/\/eileenlong-my.sharepoint.com\/:b:\/g\/personal\/david_eileenlonglcsw_com\/EUcVc3WXy4FLkBEtbl6ZOkgBXJSgV9zkQlACXEaq3U3DJQ) was written.\n\n> I've been sitting here running all these old stories through my head. You know, time warps, space warps, alien raiding parties. I mean, we really don't know if there's anything left down there, do we?\n\nSarah Jessica Parker reveals to Powers Girl that she's on her way to meet a guy she's been emailing with. Stoner girl asks if everything is going to be okay and Incel Violinist looks horny. She's going to rehab for stones. The captain announces to his nine passengers that they're beginning their descent into Bangor International Airport, near Stephen King's birthplace. Don asks Toomey to stop ripping up paper and the useless food addict yells \"well, at least we'll be able to get some chow when we land\" offscreen. Craig, sweating even more, is still ripping up magazines in the face of Don's threats. \"Try it, you little jackass,\" he says. I'm wondering where I can snag this American Pride livery for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020. Director Tom Holland manages to add drama to a more-or-less routine landing.\n\n> This place is utterly, totally deserted... You know, there's something wrong with the air here, Brian.\n\nIt's occuring to me that this may be the worst script I've ever actually sat through reading. \"This place smells wrong. Really badly wrong.\" Toomey threatens to sue the airline for $30 million for missing his 9AM meeting before seeing flashbacks to his abusive father (John Griesemer,) who mentions the Langoliers for the first time. The deserted airport scene is the reason I've written this whole thing - the dulled sounds of the characters' heels on the tarmac, the putrefied air. The clocks have stopped. The payphones are dead. The computers are lifeless. The *abadonedness* of it all. This is what the coronavirus has done to the world and to Craig Toomey. Even the battery-powered devices are dead. This is what confuses Stephen King Author Man to the point of head-rubbing and cigarette smoking for the first time in ten years.\n\n<iframe width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/D6McXLFsx-M?controls=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe>\n\nThe production was actually made at Bangor International Airport as [this incredible video](https:\/\/youtu.be\/D6McXLFsx-M) hosted by Toomey's actor explores.\n\n> LOVE IS NOT PART OF THE BIG PICTURE!\n\nIt's never actually explained what The Langoliers are. Ken Tucker for *Entertainment Weekly* describes them as \"[little meatballs](https:\/\/ew.com\/article\/1995\/05\/12\/tv-movie-review-langoliers\/).\" The little Beatles-haired girl can hear them approaching. \"It sounds a little like rice krispies after you pour the milk.\" Foodism abounds. \"A really terrible, scary sound... Something making that horrible cereal noise.\" She screams that the cereal is going to kill them. Somehow, Toomey finds a revolver while he's losing his mind. Kimber Riddle the Stoner [went to NYU](https:\/\/www.imdb.com\/name\/nm0725760\/). \n\n> Don't forget, Craiggy-weggy, the langoliers were here. And they will be back.\n\nStephen King Author Man and Food Addict note that the food and soda have gone completely flat. \"Tastes like old tire,\" says Don. \"What we're dealing with is time, not dimension,\" says Stephen King. I'm wondering what in the hell sort of room they're in at the moment, and who decided those light wood countertops were *ever* a good idea.\n\n> The bottom line is, I believe, that we have hopped an absurdly short distance into the past, say as little as 15 minutes, and we're discovering the unlovely truth about time travel. That one can't appear in the Texas State School Book Depository on November 22nd, 1963 and hope to stop the Kennedy assassination. One can't witness the building of the pyramids or the sack of Rome, or investigate the age of the dinosaurs firsthand. No, fellow time travellers, have a look around you. This is the past. It's empty. It's silent. It's a world with all the meaning of a discarded old paint can. Sensory input has disappeared. Electricity has already disappeared. And time itself is winding down in a kind of a spiral that's going faster and faster.\n\nLittle Prophet notes that the sound she's been hearing is once again getting louder. Mr. Toomey's face is shoved in the floor, his nose bent.\n\n#television #film","views":2070,"updated":"2022-04-04T07:58:40Z","tags":["television","film"],"type":null,"title":"Craig Toomey's Coronavirus","slug":"the-langoliers-stephen-king","appearance":"norm","language":"en","rtl":false,"created":"2020-05-20T19:28:28Z","collection":{"public":false,"alias":"bilge","total_posts":0,"title":"The Psalms","verification_link":"","description":"A <a href=\"https:\/\/davidblue.wtf\/db.vcf\">narcoleptic yokel<\/a> on software and culture.","style_sheet":"","views":177027,"monetization_pointer":""},"paid":false},{"id":"g61kh6ju0li1yrv0","body":"![Discord Art Orange](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/szp1oaF.png)\n\n## Why Extratone has used Discord instead of Slack for our team chat.\n\n<!--more-->\n\nBack in 2015, I hosted a pre-*Extratone* culture podcast called [*Drycast*](https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/episode\/2zjkrB28csR68YoY1M1eSk) with musician friends from all over the net. To record remotely, we originally used Teamspeak 3 - a gamer VoIP staple. When I discovered Discord, I thought we'd found podcasting heaven. Originally, the free plan included 128kbps audio in its voice channels, which was nearly twice what we were getting out of our *paid* Teamspeak server. If I were still podcasting, Discord's [just-released server video feature](https:\/\/support.discord.com\/hc\/en-us\/articles\/360041721052-Server-Video) would undoubtedly prove invaluable for live streams.\n\nhttps:\/\/twitter.com\/NeoYokel\/status\/1261334179352100865\n\nAccording to [a poll I ran on Twitter](https:\/\/twitter.com\/NeoYokel\/status\/1261334179352100865?s=20), 2\/3rds of all people on Earth are thankful for Discord's existence. This is not surprising considering what every Discord user is still offered without spending any money at all: community spaces with audio\/video and text chat capability, organizable by Twitch and YouTube-integrated roles with a plethora of different permission options, instantly and easily shareable by customizable temporary or permanent invite links through an application that's about as cross-platform as one can get (Windows, Mac, Linux, Android, iOS, or simply one's web browser.) Those of us that remember [IRC](https:\/\/twitter.com\/NeoYokel\/status\/1244758973867229185), Ventrilo, and Teamspeak should all consider Discord a tremendous gift.\n\n<iframe width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/NNJ2n6XKmmA?controls=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe>\n\nNever before have so many VoIP, video, and text chat features been offered together, or in such a beautiful package. \"What we really did was create an all-in-one voice, video, and text chat app that replaced this constellation of tools that people would use,\" said CEO Jason Citron in [an interview with CNBC](https:\/\/youtu.be\/NNJ2n6XKmmA). Technically in terms of these details, Discord *has no competition*. Slack offers text and voice chat with its paid plans, yes, but nothing close in terms of video - especially considering [Discord Go Live](https:\/\/www.polygon.com\/2019\/8\/9\/20798559\/discord-go-live-private-stream-voice-channel), its fairly-new streaming feature, which allows users to stream game video directly to 10 other users in the server. With some jury-rigging, it's possible to simply screen share this way, which is an essential sell for business video communication applications like Skype.\n\nhttps:\/\/twitter.com\/jab50yen\/status\/1270886743395520512\n\n\"Discord and Slack have many similarities, but Discord is the superior tool,\" says [esports team Ardent United](https:\/\/medium.com\/ardentunited\/why-we-use-discord-and-not-slack-500ac8027824). \"Discord has voice channels, which allows us to easily chat with our supporters and other team members. Discord also allows us to set user roles and permissions which makes moderation extremely simple.\" It's not just gaming companies, though. Decentralized cloud platform Sia also [moved their community](https:\/\/blog.sia.tech\/sia-is-moving-from-slack-to-discord-195f87feb6a6) to Discord:\n\n> Its intended audience is gamers, but many large communities have switched from Slack to Discord, including development communities like [Reactiflux](https:\/\/facebook.github.io\/react\/blog\/2015\/10\/19\/reactiflux-is-moving-to-discord.html) and [Unreal Slackers](https:\/\/medium.com\/@polymoon\/unreal-slackers-is-moving-to-discord-c93492eb0612). It includes an unlimited number of users, unlimited file uploads (with a per-file size limit), unlimited message histories, and really great moderation and spam filtering features.\n\nSlack is [often praised](https:\/\/www.pcmag.com\/reviews\/slack) for its integrations, but it shares support with [Zapier](https:\/\/zapier.com\/blog\/slack-vs-discord\/) - a dedicated web integration service which more or less integrates them equally.\n\n> Slack works with [a long list of tools](https:\/\/slack.com\/integrations), including Google Calendar, Zendesk, Salesforce, Wunderlist, and dozens of others. If you're looking for an integration that isn't immediately obvious, you can always turn to Zapier for help, because Slack is a supported service. Zapier is an online service that creates integrations between other apps and services, without you having to know any code to make it happen.\n\nFor sharing detailed post embeds, there's also [Discohook](https:\/\/discohook.org\/), which I just discovered. Productivity company Chanty's blog wrote perhaps [the most in-depth comparison](https:\/\/www.chanty.com\/blog\/discord-vs-slack) of the two services (emphasis theirs):\n\n> At their core, Discord and Slack and very similar. Both are **team chat apps** with a similar interface. Both apps have **team communication organized** in channels. The biggest difference between the two is their **target audience**, and of course, their **specific features**.\n\nUltimately, one must decide how relevant the services' respective target audiences are to productivity. For a not-for-profit media organization like *Extratone*, Discord's features-for-price ratio is simply too rich to pass up.

The idea of commanding my own starship in a universe of other “captains” alongside a hand-picked bridge crew was a beguiling one to myself and many others. This year, the game celebrated its [ten-year anniversary](https:\/\/trekmovie.com\/2020\/01\/29\/star-trek-online-legacy-celebrate-10-years-of-sto-with-jeri-ryan-and-sonequa-martin-green\/) (aligning well with the [continued involuntary beat](https:\/\/bilge.world\/about) of this blog.) I’m currently in the midst of my annual check-in with STO and thought an exploration of this most-consequential video game of my life’s history would be an appropriate undertaking.\n\nThe execution of today’s final, Arc Games-owned and maintained product is a particularly long and interesting one. As [Justin Olivetti chronicled for *Engadget*](https:\/\/www.engadget.com\/2014-11-22-the-game-archaeologist-perpetuals-star-trek-online.html), the license for *Star Trek Online* was originally [bought](https:\/\/www.gamesindustry.biz\/articles\/perpetual-entertainment-to-develop-and-publish-star-trek-massively-multiplayer-online-game) and developed on by Perpetual Entertainment, which was assaulted by [a lawsuit](https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20150127173934\/http:\/massively.joystiq.com\/2007\/12\/12\/perpetual-plot-thickens-lawsuit-filed) and extensive layoffs in December, 2006. The company was sued by Kohnke Communications for allegedly selling \"valuable assets like the Star Trek Online license\" to an affiliated entity called P2 entertainment. Clever. A quote from the complaint as [reported by *Ten Ton Hammer*](https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20150128203353\/http:\/www.tentonhammer.com\/node\/15616):\n\n> \"On information and belief, the assets transferred to P2 include Perpetual Entertainment trademarks and copyrights, the perpetual.com domain name, and assets related to Star Trek Online, including code and the license… Perpetual received less than market value for the assets it transferred to P2, and the transfer made Perpetual insolvent (or worsened Perpetual's existing insolvency).\"\n\n[Perpertual’s STO](https:\/\/memory-alpha.fandom.com\/wiki\/Star_Trek_Online_(Perpetual_Entertainment)) was significantly different from today’s MMO. Instead of captaining one’s own starship, “players would have taken on the role of an officer who would be part of a crew of a starship,” echoing old legacy titles like [*Star Trek: Bridge Commander*](https:\/\/www.ign.com\/articles\/2002\/02\/22\/star-trek-bridge-commander-review). \n\n> The proposed solution was that players could own smaller ships like fighters and minor spaceships, but the big ones -- like the Galaxy class -- would instead be adventure hubs with explorable, detailed interiors.\n\n![Perpetual Entertainment's Star Trek Online](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/dswfpYb.jpg)\n\nI was 14 in 2008 when I joined the original post-Perpetual Entertainment STO IRC channel when the game's license was [first transferred](https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20150203103236\/http:\/massively.joystiq.com\/2008\/01\/14\/star-trek-online-is-under-new-management\/) to Cryptic Studios. In fact, this channel was the only reason I left IRC clients open on my computers for years. It was exciting to find a community of people who were looking forward to participating in a *Star Trek* MMO as much as I was. I originally went by the (very cringey) username \"crazyhooligin,\" under which my current STO account is [still registered](https:\/\/ufplanets.com\/member.php?13827-DavidBlue). In the IRC channel, I met Sata - host of the now-defunct [MMO Junkies podcast](https:\/\/eileenlong-my.sharepoint.com\/:u:\/g\/personal\/david_eileenlonglcsw_com\/EV9rOQgmdINNpSWg2t_vXLwBMEMHCkqPUHOsoEX58AdkAg) and ex-Perpetual developer. He and the STORadio crew accepted me into their Teamspeak conversations despite how strange and unsocialized I was. I learned how [extensive](https:\/\/memory-alpha.fandom.com\/wiki\/Star_Trek_Online_(Perpetual_Entertainment)) and [beautiful](https:\/\/johneaves.wordpress.com\/2009\/06\/25\/more-vulcans-from-the-perpetual-files\/) their development had been. One wonders what Cryptic did with the original game and art assets and who technically owns them now.\n\n<iframe width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/Fhed2yKVYwY?controls=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe>\n\nAfter [acquiring the rights](https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20150203103236\/http:\/massively.joystiq.com\/2008\/01\/14\/star-trek-online-is-under-new-management\/) to make the game in early-2008, Cryptic was legally compelled to come up with a completed product in two years’ time as then-Executive Producer [Stephen D’Angelo](https:\/\/sto.gamepedia.com\/Stephen_D'Angelo) explained on the [100th episode of the *STOked* podcast](https:\/\/youtu.be\/a0tP0YrlJB0):\n\n> We were under a very massive deadline to deliver the game. We had acquired the license from Perpetual and Perpetual’s license had an expiration date on it, and we had to ship the game before the expiration date or we would lose the license.\n\n*STOked* also provided an excellent historical account of the acquisition entitled “[How Cryptic Saved Star Trek Online](https:\/\/youtu.be\/Fhed2yKVYwY).” By late-Fall, 2009, *Star Trek Online* [entered Closed Beta](https:\/\/trekmovie.com\/2009\/10\/22\/star-trek-online-begins-closed-beta-trekmovie-giving-away-keys\/), which I somehow acquired a key for in the name of [STOHolic.com](https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20100521081251\/http:\/www.stoholic.com\/) (a blogger site which represents one of my first web projects ever.) I was dual-booting Windows 7 Beta on my 2008 MacBook, which only supported 2 of its 4GB of RAM. The resulting performance was not optimal, but I was tremendously excited just to participate. Somewhere, there are at least three 480p handicam videos of Closed and Open Beta gameplay taken from over my shoulder, but I could not find them at the time of this writing. Comparatively, beta looked drastically different from the property that’s online today. In [this video of the original entry tutorial](https:\/\/youtu.be\/vH73ATZ96-w), we are introduced to the game’s basic controls by the voice of Zachary Quinto of J.J. Abrams fame as the new Emergency Medical Hologram in godawful dropshadowed text. The lighting is dated, the blue-based user interface even more so.\n\n![Star Trek Online Closed Beta](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/t0aZwfB.jpg)\n\nThe hair was bad and the textures of the armor, worse. So was mine, though. I uploaded two videos under my STOholic name: an [unboxing of the Collector’s Edition](https:\/\/youtu.be\/pqGll-DZp6s) and what appears to be [the definitive YouTube tutorial](https:\/\/youtu.be\/ghUJm9YWiVc) to run *Star Trek Online* on Mac OSX using the (now defunct) wineskin wrapper. Though I was sixteen years old, I appear to be about eight. Endless waves of ground enemies, pressing the \"1\" key hundreds of thousands of times to whittle them away with my phaser rifle. There were bugs on top of bugs. My favorite was a swap between one's ground and space avatars: a gigantic captain would appear in space and a little ship would appear on the ground.\n\nFour years ago, Lead Developer Al Rivera wrote “[History of Star Trek Online – a Retrospective](https:\/\/www.arcgames.com\/en\/games\/star-trek-online\/news\/detail\/10095363-history-of-star-trek-online-–-a-retrospective)” – a blog post detailing the chronology of the game from its February 2nd, 2010 release date – about a week after my 16th birthday, for which my mom bought me my first and only gaming PC. I have never been very good at video games, and *Star Trek Online* has been no exception. After 10 years, my main Captain – Ambassador Kuvak – is still not doing adequate DPS to hold my own in [Task Force Operations](https:\/\/sto.gamepedia.com\/Task_Force_Operation), from what I understand. My 15-16-year-old self chose a Science Captain but wanted to fly the great (engineering\/tank-focused) cruisers of *The Original Series*, *The Next Generation*, and the latter's movies. This is possible, but not necessarily advised. Generally, one specs an Engineering Captain to tank, a Tactical Captain for DPS, and a Science Captain for “[exotic DPS](https:\/\/youtu.be\/v5by0pRMNx8)” and light healing. I managed to level a single science character – the original – through to the max ranks using little intelligence and a lot of persistence. Later in life, I’ve learned the patience for a more deliberate approach, but still struggle to make the numbers.\n\n## The Exploration System\n\nFor many *Star Trek* fans, *Star Trek Online*’s combat feels excessive. Or at least, that’s what you’d think. The current reality is that search engine results for “[too much combat in STO](https:\/\/www.google.com\/search?sxsrf=ALeKk02Vz7pYJlsD1Vn0gDTEJIsbJM6m6g%3A1589967215922&source=hp&ei=b_nEXvrvNZCstQbVuqu4Aw&q=star+trek+online+too+much+combat&oq=star+trek+online+too+much+combat&gs_lcp=CgZwc3ktYWIQAzoECCMQJzoFCAAQgwE6AggAOgYIABAWEB46CAghEBYQHRAeOgQIIRAKOgUIIRCgAToHCCEQChCgAVDFAlidHmDbH2gAcAB4AIABcYgBhhSSAQQzMS4xmAEAoAEBqgEHZ3dzLXdpeg&sclient=psy-ab&ved=0ahUKEwi64-24kcLpAhUQVs0KHVXdCjcQ4dUDCAk&uact=5)” are virtually nill. There are some comments on [*Massively Overpowered* posts](https:\/\/massivelyop.com\/2015\/03\/05\/star-trek-online-installs-memorials-for-leonard-nimoy-and-all-those-lost\/), a [year-old blog post in *Contains Moderate Peril*](http:\/\/www.containsmoderateperil.com\/blog\/2019\/2\/27\/star-trek-online-non-combat-missions) by Roger Edwards, an old [Ryan Somna take](https:\/\/ideonexus.com\/2010\/01\/25\/star-trek-online-explore-strange-new-worlds-seek-out-new-life-and-new-civilizations-and-kill-them-looking-for-science-in-star-trek-online-beta\/), and… that’s about it. There was a definite (and entirely reasonable) argument against the amount of combat across the community early in the game’s development, but it looks like the arguers have simmered down and\/or given up. This is also reasonable, considering its now ten-year lifespan. The only trouble is that non-combat options in *Star Trek Online* have actually diminished over the years.\n\n![Star Trek Online Romulan Borg](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/BicLSE5.jpg)\n\nThe original [Exploration System](https:\/\/sto.gamepedia.com\/Exploration_Cluster) was an ingenious and significant idea that “[used automated tools to facilitate large quantities of widely varied content](https:\/\/www.arcgames.com\/en\/games\/star-trek-online\/news\/detail\/6002963-exploration-cluster-removal).” Unfortunately, the result was “nothing close to what [Cryptic] originally planned.” Instead of inspiring variety, Exploration Clusters ended up becoming the most repetitive activity in the game – nothing more than a good source of crafting materials. The missions were generic and the environments simply randomly combined segments of the same interior textures. Procedurally generated environments would hit the mainstream conversation years later with [*No Man’s Sky*](https:\/\/www.polygon.com\/2016\/8\/12\/12461520\/no-mans-sky-review-ps4-playstation-4-pc-windows-hello-games-sony), which was written about in two fascinating articles by Raffi Khatchadourian in [*The New Yorker*](https:\/\/www.newyorker.com\/magazine\/2015\/05\/18\/world-without-end-raffi-khatchadourian) and Chris Baker in [*Rolling Stone*](https:\/\/www.rollingstone.com\/culture\/culture-news\/no-mans-sky-how-games-are-building-themselves-104779\/):\n\n> Using procedural generation isn’t simply about offloading the creative process onto an algorithm – the real challenge is that it requires developers to teach an algorithm the difference between good and bad game design.\n\nPerhaps if *Star Trek Online*’s initial development window had not been so limited, Cryptic would’ve had time and resources to pioneer something truly *Trek* and extraordinary in the exploration system, but it ended up having to kill the idea altogether – no amount of [Change.org petitions](https:\/\/www.change.org\/p\/cryptic-bring-exploration-to-star-trek-online-and-sto-back-to-the-true-roots-of-star-trek) could prevent this.\n\n<iframe width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/P9hz5ii77lc?controls=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe>\n\n## The Foundry\n\nPerhaps *the* most innovative feature *Star Trek Online* contributed to gaming as a whole came to the live server in Spring, 2011. It was called [The Foundry](https:\/\/sto.gamepedia.com\/The_Foundry), and it allowed players access to a diluted form of the same mission creation tools Cryptic themselves used to create content, enabling the community to publish its own playable stories. The result was a wonder virtually inexpressible in words. In player-made Foundry Missions, I found joy, wonder, sorrow, and insight – truly everything and more than one could ever want from fiction. Throughout 2013-2014 my girlfriend at the time and I ran regular [Foundry missions](https:\/\/sto.gamepedia.com\/Foundry:List_of_missions) together along with couple friends in our fleet. Unfortunately, I cannot remember a single specific mission (aside from [*Unholy Alliances*](https:\/\/youtu.be\/zrXTZfHk4HQ), I think,) but I remember the storytelling. I remember laughing at, dwelling on, and even crying for the characters we were introduced to. There were farming-oriented missions and some fairly rough drafts, sure, but the vast majority of the content was deliberately and delicately considered, especially the [Foundry Spotlight](https:\/\/www.arcgames.com\/en\/games\/star-trek-online\/news\/detail\/3027483) series, which highlighted player-created stories of a particular quality and intrigue.\n\n![Ambassador Class](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/CGCgrAb.jpg)\n\nLast April, however, [Arc retired the Foundry forever](https:\/\/www.arcgames.com\/en\/games\/star-trek-online\/news\/detail\/11102923) – perhaps the worst possible news – stating “the legacy knowledge required to maintain the Foundry at our quality standards is no longer available,” meaning – as [Rodger Edwards notes](http:\/\/www.containsmoderateperil.com\/blog\/2019\/3\/4\/cryptic-to-close-the-foundry) – that all developers with their hands, hearts, and heads in the project had long since departed the company. The community reaction was heartbreaking. On Reddit, a group of mission authors and devotees [committed to capturing](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/sto\/comments\/ayobu4\/one_mans_quest_to_save_the_foundry\/) as many Foundry Missions as possible on video in the month between the announcement and date of death. User [waimser](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/user\/waimser\/) lamented the loss of the Foundry as a critical hit to *Star Trek Online*’s endgame:\n\n> Once you've played through the story missions and built your ship, the foundry is what's left, and it has some damn good stuff.\n\nThe group even created a Google Docs spreadsheet to coordinate the effort. Another created [a thread in the *Star Trek Online* forums](https:\/\/www.arcgames.com\/en\/forums\/startrekonline#\/discussion\/1247628\/keeping-up-with-the-foundry-after-the-foundry-general-psa-preserved-content) dedicated to “aggregating the various channels with Foundry content and providing those links to you and updating them as necessary.” In [an interview for *Gamesindustry.biz*](https:\/\/www.gamesindustry.biz\/articles\/2020-02-11-how-star-trek-online-managed-to-live-long-and-prosper), Al Rivera suggested that the secret to the title’s longevity in which his team had been “strategically successful” was knowing when and when not to make drastic changes. “Don't change the fundamentals of what players love about your game,” he suggested.\n\n![UFP Fleet Roster](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/Vuz4d3N.jpg)\n\n## Community\n\nThough *STOked* and *STORadio* have long since been off the air, the Roddenberry Podcast Network’s *PriorityOne* is still going strong, having just recorded [its 460th episode](https:\/\/priorityonepodcast.com\/460-rebranding-kirk-casting-groupees-priority-one-a-roddenberry-star-trek-podcast\/). As I discovered last year, the game’s Twitch community is also thriving. [Layiena](https:\/\/www.twitch.tv\/layriena)’s streams are incredible because - while he understands theory as well as the other broadcasters in the STO Twitch community - it’s his incredible skills at live Captain commentary (calling out abilities and other command inputs as if he really is in the captain’s chair.) It may sound cringey (and perhaps it would be to many,) but his thoroughness and accuracy actually 1) make it seem pretty darn cool to me and 2) are hugely valuable in helping the viewer understand what he’s doing. After some three years, I know my one rotation fairly well, but only three or four of its steps by name – not even remotely well enough to do what he does. Unfortunately, it appears as though he’s been inactive since last year.\n\n[Sphynx](https:\/\/www.twitch.tv\/sphynx_sto)’s streams also have an especially professional feel – he is excellent at calling out his actions as well, if perhaps without so much intensity. His Norwegian sensibility is wonderful: when I introduced myself as being around in the community since 2008, he remarked “that’s strange considering the game has only been out since 2010.” Nigh-universally common threads among them: imperturbable kindness to their audience and an impressively wholesome commitment to *actually having fun*. Though I’m far from deeply saturated with Twitch culture as a whole, I’ve watched my fair share of *Eve Online*, *World of Warships*, and *Gran Turismo Sport* streams, and – while all of these have incredible communities – there’s none quite like the sincerity of the *Star Trek* fraternity.\n\nA few weeks ago, I departed my own derelict STO fleet for the aptly-named [United Federation of Planets](https:\/\/ufplanets.com\/) which has over three thousand (presumably at least semi-active) members in its [fleet armada](https:\/\/www.arcgames.com\/en\/games\/star-trek-online\/news\/detail\/9436793). The fleet website has [user profiles](https:\/\/ufplanets.com\/member.php?13827-DavidBlue), a [very active forum](https:\/\/ufplanets.com\/forum.php), and a [Discord server](https:\/\/discord.gg\/M6UKBVj) – everything I could possibly ask for. So far, I have been welcomed with [overwhelming positivity](https:\/\/ufplanets.com\/showthread.php?78194-Application-DavidBlue), and I’m grateful. In a prompt posted on both [their forums](https:\/\/ufplanets.com\/showthread.php?78339-Your-Favorite-Part-of-the-Community) and [Reddit](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/sto\/comments\/gpyxcm\/your_favorite_part_of_the_community\/), I asked players what their favorite part of the community is. Oddly enough, some of the responses I got from the latter were quite jaded: “I really enjoy the love and respect the PVP community gets. No, wait...” [Alex Rowe for *The Startup*](https:\/\/medium.com\/swlh\/star-trek-online-ten-years-old-still-fun-eacd72b1380):\n\n> [The game’s subreddit](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/sto\/) is full of folks who are tired of the game because they’ve blasted through all the content, but as someone who has only seen about 1\/6th of the quests currently in the game, I’m eager to check out more.\n\nUser [JediMasterx4](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/user\/JediMasterx4\/) seemed [particularly disgruntled](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/sto\/comments\/gpyxcm\/your_favorite_part_of_the_community\/frsanzq?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x):\n\n> You can do all the lockbox promo vids you want, but you are going to have to live in reality, no matter where your ego flies off to.\n\nHowever, there *were* some positives. User [ModestArk](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/user\/ModestArk\/):\n\n> What I really like about this community is that it seems to be more grown up than other gaming communities.

JustGaming4Us produced an excellent, [in-depth video review](https:\/\/youtu.be\/KHhakbz6q8s) of the two missions as well as a [tour of the event as a whole](https:\/\/youtu.be\/M3KJkcCaymA). I, for one, have never been partial to Shiny New Ship gluttony largely because of how long it took me to “master” my own Intrepid-Class Retrofit – christened the U.S.S. *Bataan* after the aircraft carrier my grandfather served on in WWII – as much as I have. It took me years to arrange my bridge officer abilities and their keybinds in such a way that I could maintain a fairly-steady dps rotation and I have no desire to go through the process of learning a new ship again. For most veteran players, however, trying out different ships\/skill specs is all there is left to do.\n\nChoosing whether or not – or to whom – to recommend the game is an issue best left to actual gaming journalists. In March, *Massively Overpowered* – the followup project to what was once *Massively.com* – published [Mia DeSanzo’s account](https:\/\/massivelyop.com\/2020\/03\/30\/mmo-cartographer-boldly-going-into-star-trek-online\/) of her first experience in the game:\n\n> Everything you’ve heard is true. Ground combat is, as multiple sources have told me, “a hot mess.” I don’t think clunky is an adequate descriptor. You’d have to try it.\n\nFor the same site, [Tyler F.M. Edwards argued](https:\/\/massivelyop.com\/2020\/01\/23\/why-i-play-is-star-trek-online-worth-playing-in-2020\/) in January that *Star Trek Online* is best left to those who already love *Star Trek*:\n\n> STO has some things going for it as a video game, and it’s certainly unique in the MMO space, but it has too many basis quality issues for it to be a game I’d recommend to someone who’s never watched an episode of Star Trek.\n\nCompared to what I experienced all those years ago in Closed and Open Beta, *Star Trek Online* is now *vastly* more polished, but perhaps compared to other MMOs in 2020, it is, indeed, “rough.” In my casual return this past month, I have yet to experience any significant bugs.

Apparently, my old lockbox collection might actually be worth some significant Energy Credits on the Exchange – as of the time of this writing, however, not a one had yet to sell.\n\n![Constellation Class Retrofit](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/R2MgVJD.jpg)\n\nIf you’re a ship junkie who’s entirely unfamiliar with the property, know that *Star Trek*’s ships are *fucking cute*. The [Nebula Class](https:\/\/www.startrek.com\/article\/inside-the-nebula-class-starship), especially, inspires real affection. In my opinion, it alone is worth giving this free-to-play game a shot. My two point eight pound [Surface Laptop 2](https:\/\/extratone.com\/microsoft-surface-laptop-2-review-windows-future) is enough to run it fairly well at medium-high settings, which is an absurdly low barrier-to-entry.

In the right hour, the fickle wind and the social owls were the only sound, and nothing moved but the sparse, light-footed doe in careful segments with her fawn. From the main gated lane of *The Nice, Huge Estate*, Lenny Lather slid through the muddy barrier and started bouncing West on the blacktop, brogues squeaking every third step. The overcasted clouds were having trouble deciding whether or not to let down their rain – as they had been all day – and the old, heavy early-March mist softened the yellow glow of the tall, buzzing streetlamps so much that he couldn’t help but intermittently wipe his eyes, for the spreading light convinced his mind that his eyelashes must’ve been wetted.\n\nTheodore Pith’s big old house was now burrowed between two mismatched neighborhoods – the bleaker Easterly, which was too new for its alien trees to have recovered from the brutality of its development’s clear-cutting and contained within one of its central featureless backyards an unidentifiable creature which made all through the night the most unimaginably ghastly, disturbingly human child-like shrieking; the opposing Westerly’s trees further enough along in their regrowth – ten or twenty years perhaps – to appear more of the planet Earth to Manhattan-bred Lenny Lather, who still found the colorless destruction of suburbia unendingly upsetting, especially when coming down. In the interest of his regular withdrawal’s mitigation, he had already established two short, repeatable tracks and a longer, several mile-long loop which skirted him sufficiently around the East’s center to avoid hearing the shrieks in all but the stillest nights. Never in his years – on these walks he was *especially* reminded of just how many there were – had he been able to feel such absolute ownership of his surroundings. The eroding Earth slipping away from the hem of the warped, stained wood fences; the sidewalks, cracked, bent, sloped helter-skelter, often muddied in the troughs and joints – generally laying haphazardly in layers after having been steadily tossed about by the glacial forces of their intermixture with clay, precipitation, and the tumultuous temperature-dependent torture of the two – these were his, entirely, in the right hour. Between two and five in the morning when the earliest risers would blearily revive their dewy automobiles from long, silent hibernation, the whole world – everything in his sight and more at any moment – it was all *his*, without a single worthy challenger.\n\nIn the right hour, the roads were completely and totally abandoned – for the New Yorker, an unfathomable absolute – and all humanity was at rest. In the right hour, Lenny Lather was the appointed guardian of the worn domesticity of a small nation, though the lonely occupation was astoundingly lax, for in the miles and miles of empty streets he had already traversed in his nightly holidays from the World of Pith, he had yet to encounter a single unexpected factor or minutely threatening presence. Since shortly after his December arrival, he’d walked through even the most frigid mornings. Of course, the stillness had then been *even more* otherworldly, and Lenny was curious to see how his new most private domain would change with the seasons. Though the auxiliary guest room which he now called home was no smaller or less hospitable than the master bedroom of his late Hudson Yards flat shared with his late Wife, it proved to be a poor respite from Theodore Pith, who treated him – when they were “home” at *Nice, Huge* – as the puppy he never had, and expected his participation to remain entirely vulnerable to his any whim. Granted – in their shared abuse of amphetamines, cocaine, and assorted other stimulants – Lenny Lather was vastly more prepared for the games than any circadian guest could’ve possibly been. At first, the ten-foot door of his dawn-facing room had closed without latching, but with the warmth and moisture brought with the Midwestern Spring, the most secure state in which the engorged wood could be forcibly arranged still left a half-inch crack, and Lather’s last chance of privacy was lost.\n\nThe latest favorite pastime of *Nice, Big*’s Master necessitated a willing, capable driver, and – as keeping a single Butler (much less an entire household staff) was proving extremely difficult for him – Lenny Lather was the sole pick of the draft. In the earliest hours of one Tuesday morning in February, he’d been pleasantly dosing and drooling on his laptop after an evening of obsessive, incoherent notetaking when the huge door had been kicked ajar by a deep black, blindingly shiny oxford with excessively violent force. Attached to the shoe in an equally blinding penguin tuxedo, towering bowler hat, and cartoonish fake mustache was the Great, Blown Pith.\n\n“Hope you’re not busy,” he’d said quite loudly to the lolling Lather, leaning and tilting his head into the lamp light, which had dislodged his monocle and briefly occupied him with untangling its chain.\n\n…\n\n“You’re not *busy*, are ya?!” he’d shouted, tapping the shiny brass lion’s head of his shiny black cane against the vanity… then swatting it with a flicking wrist… then clubbing it with a full, two-handed homerun swing – taking huge, vaguely cat nose-shaped gouges from the surface of the wood. The splintery wood chips had rained down upon the hunched Lenny; he’d stirred with one found its way in his open mouth – he’d chewed it slowly and swallowed it, but he still had not awoken. Nevertheless, Theodore Pith’s coked-up enthusiasm couldn’t possibly have yielded to common decencies like his guest’s nighttime peace.\n\n…\n\n“SHOOT, LENNY,” he’d screamed in his companion’s ear, having traversed the room to his bedside.\n\n“I SURE HOPE YOU’RE NOT BUSY RIGHT NOW!”\n\n…\n\nFinally, he’d resorted to tickling Lenny’s nose with the ornament, which had reeked with the urinal smell of metal polish – the sudden, overwhelming delivery of which to the writer’s olfactory nerves finally causing ample alarm in his nervous system to justify bringing him abruptly back to his life and deluded host.\n\n“I need a favor. The Duesie’s warming up. We’re going for a ride.”\n\nUnable to form a linguistic response, Lenny Lather had obeyed Theo’s frenzied, repeating instructions and stumbled into the matching suit he’d brought over his arm – wondering with marginal, arrested clarity at how well-tailored it was for him. He had not the soundness of perception to protest when Pith had whipped a deep black, blindingly shiny bowtie around his already-congested esophagus, nor when he’d adheased the huge, itchy matching fake moustache to his upper lip and nearly pulled the matching Tower of Bowler all the way down over his ears. He had been unresponsive when he’d been sat on the bench under the agonizing fluorescent lights of the laundry room, affixed with deep black, blindingly shiny matching oxfords, and asked if he smoked and how well he could say *guffaw.*\n\n…\n\n“Just wait… you have no idea… you have no idea how much fun this is going to be.”\n\nLenny Lather had not… *could not* have made a sound through the confusing nonsense of his waking pre-Great Depression dream, but when the old servant’s door had been opened before him and set the heartless, single-digit Winter wind upon his very soul, he had all at once arrived in the world, laughing and whooping together with Theodore Pith.\n\n“Jesus *Christ!*” he’d screamed as they’d hobbled to the stable, where a devilishly dark red Model J Duesenberg had sat shivering in a rough idle, staring out the retrofitted garage door with its basketball-sized lights as if it was, indeed, a flesh-and-blood steed that had just been frightened awake by a thunderstorm, but the sky had been as clear as it would’ve been from an asteroid – as it is only on the coldest nights – and almost comically dominated by the setting, gluttonously luminescent moon. Theodore had then grabbed a screwdriver from the workbench and bent down to remove the license plate – which had said *BLOOD* in big black bold block letters – and its containing frame. By the time he had settled into the frigid red leather of the exposed, roofless driver’s seat, Lenny Lather was full-to-bursting with adrenaline and laughing out huge streams of breathy steam. From behind him in the cabin, Pith had been *guffawing* plumes, too, as he’d briefly ignited his cocaine-sprinkled mustache instead of the bratwurst-sized cigar between his teeth. The smell of burning human hair had accented his explanation of the old car’s transmission and its direct path from source-to-nose for Pith had required a brief, unplanned intermission as it induced without warning his violent heaving – still part-*guffawing* – hanging half out of his beautifully-upholstered suicide door.\n\nAs he had spewed – expertly sparing the swoop of the gleaming waxy fender – Lenny had found a pair of deep black, blindingly shiny gloves and – after less grinding than you would imagine, to his credit – first gear, setting the whole dastardly circus in motion.\n\n“Where to, Sire?” Lenny had asked, nose lifted to an untenable altitude in a pitiful approximation of an accent that’d never actually been used before by any person or persons in all of history, struggling for breath.\n\n“Left at the gates, Barnsward, old chap,” Theodore had replied in a contrasting fashion after again sitting upright from his heaves and taking a breath, ironing out – if anything – the flatness of his perforating Ohio Ds and Ps, resulting in such a culturally destructive racket that it had set both of them in uncontrollable, cloudy fits lasting long after Lather had swerved the great length of the car from the gravel to his abandoned asphalt retreat. The two had continued their banter down that soul-suckingly flat vector, one-upping each other’s etymologic barbarity against the savage thievery of the heatless wind.\n\n“Now to star-board, Budleigh, my good fellow!”\n\n…\n\n“Right-o, as you say, sir!”\n\n…\n\n“Down to the *pu-hb* for a *spaht* of *brahn*-dee with me *mae-its*!”\n\n…\n\n“*Oncemo-ar* right, pip pip!”\n\n…\n\n“By *jah-lee*, there we are!”\n\n…\n\nAfter the entirety of Northern European history had been decimated and subsequently forgotten, the Duesenberg named *BLOOD* had turned its orange, googley-eyed stare and narrow whitewalled hooves up the reflective, freshly-painted access of the new 24-hour grocery in the no-man’s-land between the cookie-cutter stares of the neatly-rowed Easterly neighborhood and the droning respiration of Interstate 43, two miles distant. It was 2:12 in the morning and most of the greasy-haired night stocking shift had been halfway through their third smoke break, circled around a store-used picnic table 50 yards from the far sliding airlock doors. The first to spot *BLOOD* had been the second shortest of the lot, whose weary scrutiny along the truest radian to the West from under his sweaty beanie in her entrance she had crossed, and the depth of her red as he first spied it had caused him vertigo – as if he would fall in – and cast upon the shorter-than-average length of his being an all-consuming existential doubt. The tallest and loudest of them had faced squarest the white faux-brick wall of the box building and was at that moment engaged upon a spirited rant about where and where’nt and when a vapist ought to buy his Suck juice between long, gasping Sucks from his super-shiny Suck box. Of course, the arrival of a customer even at such a late hour did not warrant notice at a huge, broadly-servicing operation like theirs, but as *BLOOD* had crept through all four reflective yellow-checkered pedestrian crossings, closing without a flinch, and the details of her occupying caricatures had become more and more numerous, she had stolen the attention of the huddle, one-by-one, and elicited from each the rarest under-breath profanity of true, unmolested wonder.\n\n“*Jesus Christ*,” had said the shortest.\n\n“*Holy fuck,*” had said the youngest.\n\n“*Gee whiz*,” had said the oldest.\n\nAnd the Sucking tallest, having realized he’d lost his audience, had been the last to turn and follow their eyes *BLOOD*’s way as she had halted coolly in front of the purely white glowing concrete leading into the closest customer entrance, and had – without the gradual exposure over the length of her approach that his peers had been afforded – dropped his Suck box and exclaimed at the sudden, undiluted immensity of the spectacle, simply, “*FUCK!*”\n\nThe Sucking’s *FUCK* and the splitting shatter of his Suck against the glass of their smoking table had reached the two arrivees – albeit in a muted way – and through the onset of their frostbite’s early stages even further stoked their already-uncontrollable boyish giggling. Theodore Pith had paused briefly to affix his monocle as firmly as possible in his eye socket and stuff down his spasmic *guffaws* with a few lip-smacking puffs of his then successfully-lit cigar before swinging his right door open.\n\n“Stay here and wait at the ready, my good… my *best* Bagsy! I shan’t be a twinkle,” he had declared, clicking it lightly shut again and turning on his heels toward the pale light of the store, twirling his cane in dramatically shortened strides so as to reproduce the oversped effect of a silent motion picture, puff-puffing away. As the doors had sensed him and indiscriminately whirred aside, he had turned to the smokers – most of whom had still been reeling, grabbing for their hair – and bobbed the bulk of his big black bowler toward their communion with his gloved black fingers by the brim.\n\n“Tally-*ho*, my boys!” he had shouted, sending Lenny Lather’s wide open face toward the floor of the idling car as he doubled over himself in the first spontaneously asphyxiating, tear-lobbing laughter he’d yet to experience in the 21st century. As Theodore had entered the masterpiece of the boxed store’s bleakness in his cane twirling, head swinging, cigar puffing shuffle, he had made sure to stay his instinct to *sneak* for a swift, full-chat *dart*, instead, and the on-duty leather-faced embodiment of tedium’s wrath beneath his lone lit lane light had looked up from his *People* Magazine just in time to see the heel of a deeply black oxford and the last shiny inches of flowing black coattails disappear behind the potato sack endcap of the far Aisle 1. He’d hesitated, chin against palm, holding his next glossed page perpendicularly erect between his tightened thumb and index finger for a long few seconds of fantastic stillness – had hastily attempted a diagnostic of his present senses – before a locomotive-like segmented tube of cigar smoke had risen from against the light tiles and unsoiled trimming to intersect his line-of-sight where it met the darkened deli, recessed in the far wall from his hunch, the motion startling him into his own throat-clearing, counter-rounding, key-jingling, *excuse me*-shouting march toward the lumpy potato sacks and the climbing dissipation of the most unbelievable violation. As he had jingled, he had reflected on the few occasions in which he’d ever smelled tobacco smoke in *his* store: all incidental, most very brief, and many followed by a lengthy, unreasonably self-deprecating apology. To just walk in his Temple of Domestic Fulfilment during this most Serene Time of Silent Service, spewing orange nicotine on his premium, Food & Drug Administration-blessed body and blood offering to the middle class was surely in ignorance, but could have even been *in spite*. Regardless, the transgression was worthy of the most merciless wrath, and he had been selected as its willing, capable vessel. In just the fifteen seconds it’d taken him to jingle his way to Aisle 1, he’d thought himself and his leather into flash-broiling, fast-rising fury.\n\nPerhaps the least expected sight that could have possibly greeted this Apostle of Appraisal on the far side of Aisle 1 – as he rounded the potato sack endcap and filled his *excuse me* lungs in preparation through his nose – was the labored lifting of the 125-pound eldest child of the new, Parisian-trained, full-time, certified cheese artisan – whom the store had just won out of 175 competitors in a region-wide raffle of her pilot program – by the dashing, swinging, and smoking real-life manifestation of a young Rich Uncle Pennybags, yet shock did not long halt the Keys & Leather.\n\n“Sir! Excuse me!”\n\n…\n\n“*Excuse me!* Sir!”\n\n…\n\nTheodore Pith – having reevaluated the girth of his intended booty – had propped his shiny black cane against the sill of the refrigerator and popped each slack bottom up off his oxfords from his shins before squatting over the massive Holy Wheel of the Artisan where it lay displayed on a sturdy bespoke plinth.\n\n…\n\n“Sir! You need to put out that cigar… the cigar – put it out immediately!”\n\nKeys & Leather had the odd inability to both shout and shuffle at the same time, so he’d only made it to the pomegranate juice by the time Pith had mustered enough momentum to swing the cheese child into a high enough pendulum to carry it stably facing forward under his chin with his two hands spaced evenly on the Great Wheel’s bottom.\n\n…\n\n“Sir! I’m going to have to ask you to put that down… That is a four thousand dollar item… If you want to buy it, we need to go about-”\n\n“…now, see here!” Pith had replied with great effort, in the midst of weighing in his mind the worth of the cane as a casualty, then of the monocle, too, which had fallen out while he was weighing, and of his own physical intelligence, and whether or not it was capable of retrieving the cane by its brass lion’s head handle via the top of a flicking foot without losing his balance. Keys & Leather, meanwhile, had been tortured at great length witnessing – in Theodore’s gravitational struggle – the Cuban’s ashes knocked all over the precious round Immanuel; the artisan’s Beloved, Chosen son of cheese – a nauseating sensation of loss overwhelming all hope of his store’s defense. The Terrible Theodore had at once noticed his hesitation *and* arrived upon a plan to leave no prop behind. He had leaned forward with the girth of the wheel and closed the remaining few feet between them, advancing with the huge mass of Nazarethian dairy to bear it all down upon the unsuspecting Leather, who in his grief for the prized wheel was far too slow to deflect its incoming mass.\n\n“Now, see here, chum!” Pith had forced from the furthest possible extremis of his best mob mouth as he transferred his burden all at once to its most concerned party, who collapsed against the multilayered tables that made up the fresh cookie display, with the weight of the wheel on his belly. As the stunned Leather struggled to separate himself without further soiling the only item in his store that sold for double a month’s paycheck, Theodore had replaced his monocle and returned for his cane in a single stride, which he’d then used after a return step to the pile of chocolate chip, almond nut, and fuming night manager to rap loose with the snout of the terrible brass cat Leather’s white knuckle-tight grip on the wheel with a lampoonish *haha!* before rolling the freed cheese toward the door in a villainous cackle.\n\n“Man, *come on*,” the defeated Leather had yelled halfheartedly from his pile of sweets, struggling against the awkward, slippery boxes for enough footing to stand. His efforts, though, were interrupted after a time by the abrupt mute of Pith’s cackling in the second swooshing of the front sliding doors – he had missed his last chance of pursuit. It had all been in vain – he’d failed to guard the crown jewel of the whole suburb. As he had given up the chase and the cheese and slumped once more against the ruined pile, the ridiculousness of the crime against him nearly cracked a smile, but soon was deterred by the very real thought of explaining what had happened to his General Manager when she arrived in just five hours. After a moment, there, covered in cookies, dust, ashes, and shame, he had quietly begun to sob.\n\nAfter he had regained control of his diaphragm, Lenny Lather had been amused, outside, by the varying velocities in which the smokers of the night shift gave in to their curiosities about the presence of the seven-figure collectible and its purpose in waiting at its now healthier idle in front of their grocery store in the loneliest time of a Tuesday morning. The first and the bravest had been the one who first spotted their intrusion – the shortest – if only because he had remained entirely convinced for the duration that *BLOOD* and its two, period-dressed occupants were nothing but an apparition of his dead Grandfather and Great Uncle like others he’d thought he’d seen before, and – though he’d been terrified by the clarity of this realest visit yet, he’d been irritated more than anything, and wanted to know “why the hell can’t you just leave me *alone*?!” The others behind him had been staggered in the proximity to the waiting car they had achieved – the lesser and most cowardly being the largest – the Sucking evangelist – who had been waiting for the great automobile to leave so he could forge the exchange of his broken Suck box for a new one from the back. In the delirium of his exhaustion and progressing frostbite, Lenny Lather had thought the image of the men where they were would make for an interesting, organic graph on the nature of courage – their positions simply representing their unaltered datapoints, and had been considering how best to deal with or respond to the nearer, deluded one, who had by then come close enough to the elegant, professionally polished front-right fender to reach out and touch it with his unwashed hands, and appeared to be taking the matter under serious consideration. He’d been seconds away from finally deciding between his idiotic ideas for a joke response when by far the largest wheel of cheese he’d ever seen had come rolling out of the opening doors onto the concrete, followed closely behind by Theodore Pith who’d still had three-quarters or more of his cigar left to smoke and apparently switched to cheap mob clichés in his brief absence.\n\n“Haste, Don Lenny!” he’d yelled, re-opening his closest cabin door to chuck his cane in first. He’d then straddled the great wheel to position it against the step before making a scene of grunting and huffing against its side with his full weight. Again, the bewildered smokers had fallen silent – they did not recognize the ridiculous delicacy because it was special inventory and could only be handled by the Holy Artisan herself. Lather had started revving the huge old straight-8 to answer Pith’s urgency, who had found himself fresh out of phrases after the wheel had finally succumbed to its capture and rolled into the footwell.\n\n“Make haste, make haste, my boy!” he’d shouted, diving theatrically into the covered back seat, head-first, to which his icing chauffer had responded by revving the behemoth and briskly popping her clutch, which had lurched the pair into the last, getaway stage of their late grocery heist. As *BLOOD*’s razor-edged hood ornament had sliced through the night by the dumbstruck smokers, Theodore Pith was unable to think of anything to shout at them as he passed but for “bada-bing, bada-*BOOM!*”\n\nThough the Lake Geneva Police Department was shown the security footage of that first theft by management, the theatricality of their matching getup had inadvertently obscured their identities, and the organization’s extreme deficit of imagination had left them stumped by the lack of license plates on the car, despite the free and effortless ability of just about any casual enthusiast of early American luxury automobiles and\/or lackadaisical disciple of the Concours religion to immediately identify *BLOOD* by *name* from the grainiest image, if consulted. If anything, their incompetence rewarded Pith and Lather’s continued focus on the products of the same store’s cheese artisan, as intelligence on the state of her latest flagship incubation was freely available with no more effort than it took to simply stop by her display amid regular shopping trips. Twice in two weeks, they stole both of her replacements for the biggest child without any significant alternation of their method, which frustrated her and the management nearly to the point of crises, and quickly lost all potential for fun in a third attempt – their kicks were in their absurdity, not their *effectiveness*, and neither of them cared much for the cheese.\n\n#fiction","views":1974,"updated":"2022-03-18T16:43:45Z","tags":["fiction"],"type":null,"title":"Excerpt: Blimp's Burden, Chapter VI","slug":"blimps-burden-chapter-6","appearance":"norm","language":"en","rtl":false,"created":"2020-05-27T01:25:58Z","images":["https:\/\/i.snap.as\/BEgMZAo.jpg"],"collection":{"public":false,"alias":"bilge","total_posts":0,"title":"The Psalms","verification_link":"","description":"A <a href=\"https:\/\/davidblue.wtf\/db.vcf\">narcoleptic yokel<\/a> on software and culture.","style_sheet":"","views":177027,"monetization_pointer":""},"paid":false},{"id":"v8sxr35jsq8kl557","body":"![Bilge Version 2.3](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/TOjg9SE.png)\n\n## New look, more posts\n\n<!--more-->\n\nI've been devoting significant attention to this blog recently, and I hope it shows.

Last month, *The Verge*'s Dieter Bohn reported that [Google plans to begin accounting for \"page experience\" in its search rankings](https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2020\/5\/28\/21272543\/google-search-results-page-experience-load-time-contentfu-paint-layout-shift-top-stories-amp) beginning in 2021, later explaining in a [subsequent episode of *The Vergecast*](https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/21274502\/vergecast-podcast-407-trump-executive-order-social-media-hbo-max-launch): \n\n> Here is another example of the Chrome team coming up with a bunch of web standards and then the Search team making a bunch of incentives based on those standards.\n\nIt was news to me that in May, Google [launched](https:\/\/blog.chromium.org\/2020\/05\/introducing-web-vitals-essential-metrics.html) a page called \"Web Vitals\" on its [**web.dev**](https:\/\/web.dev\/vitals\/) domain (which they've [apparently owned since November 2018](http:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20180415000000*\/web.dev).) The company measures \"page experience\" based on three main criteria:\n\n> - [**Largest Contentful Paint**](https:\/\/web.dev\/lcp\/) measures perceived load speed and marks the point in the page load timeline when the page's main content has likely loaded.\n> - [**First Input Delay**](https:\/\/web.dev\/fid\/) measures responsiveness and quantifies the experience users feel when trying to first interact with the page.\n> - [**Cumulative Layout Shift**](https:\/\/web.dev\/cls\/) measures visual stability and quantifies the amount of unexpected layout shift of visible page content.\n\n[CoStar](https:\/\/www.costarastrology.com\/neoyokel) just sent an oddly topical (and honestly, encouraging) notification:\n\n![Costar Notification](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/1Lo8JrN.jpeg)\n\nI'm not a \"real\" web developer - nor do I mean to dictate to a single one - but I know enough theory to note that of this \"core web\" education operation centered around web.dev is operating on some irritating assumptions:\n\n### 1. Smaller assets are ideal.\n\nThe simple assumption that it is always better to have the smallest page possible - that images should be resized and compressed to hell and typography\/other elements should be few in number. Instantaneous page loads should be priority over any other standards of measure for a web page - like interesting design, for instance.\n\n### 2. Minimalistic design is necessary.\n\nThe reality - for most of the Western world, at least - is that [average network speeds are exponentially increasing](https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/kevinmurnane\/2018\/12\/11\/heres-how-internet-speeds-fared-for-the-worlds-fastest-and-largest-countries-in-2018\/#3f3124664976) year-by-year. In 2018:\n\n> World-wide average mobile download speed was 22.82 Mbps (Megabits per second), an increase of 15.2% over 2017. Average upload speed was 9.19 Mbps, an increase of 11.6%. Fixed broadband speeds also increased. Average download speed increased 26.4% to 46.12 Mbps, while average upload speed came in at 22.44 Mbps, a 26.5% increase.\n\nI may be a yokel, but these averages are still absolutely *inconceivable* to me. Our phones have as much RAM as my \"studio\" work desktop, now. 22.82 Mbps will reliably download *very* complex web pages nearly instantaneously. There is a very reasonable argument for essential services like search engines and news websites to conform to\/adopt standards like AMP, but for the rest of The Open Web, ingenuity and risktaking should be *encouraged*, not discouraged, for the true good of all Peoplekind.\n\nA term I haven't seen for a good while describes this ideology: \"the **mobile web**,\" and it completely sucking ass is not a new concept. I've before referenced [an old complaint](https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2015\/7\/20\/9002721\/the-mobile-web-sucks) from 2015 by *The Verge*'s Editor-in-Chief, Nilay Patel (which the original article also links in different context in its last line):\n\n> The entire point of the web was to democratize and simplify publishing using standards that anyone could build on, and it has been a raging, massively disruptive success for decades now. But the iPhone's depressing combination of [dominant mobile web marketshare](https:\/\/www.netmarketshare.com\/browser-market-share.aspx?qprid=0&qpcustomd=1) and shitbox performance means we're all sort of ready to throw that progress away.\n\n### 3. Google has the right to dictate \"Best Practices.\"\n\nThe Mobile Web as a utility has its place, but it's certainly not a necessary or desirable ideal for the entirety of The Web, yet Google has the audacity to presume it can dictate what is and is not optimal web design. The URL in and of itself is extremely presumptuous - Google technically has every right to own web.dev, sure, but *should* it? The Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMP) program has already had an annoying effect on day-to-day browsing. I despise AMP links more than most things in life, just as I despise the name of the website *Search Engine Land* (which sounds like actual hell) who [also reported on this](https:\/\/searchengineland.com\/the-google-page-experience-update-user-experience-to-become-a-google-ranking-factor-335252):\n\n> If you have AMP, the good news is that the majority of AMP pages do extremely well in terms of page experience metrics, [Google Project Manager] Rudy Galfi said. It doesn’t mean that all AMP pages will have top page experience metrics, but AMP is built in a way to help with this.\n\nRecently, I discovered an incredibly refreshing\/affirming essay wrapped in a hand-build web experience called \"[Rediscovering the Small Web](https:\/\/neustadt.fr\/essays\/the-small-web\/)\" by designer [Parimal Satyal](https:\/\/twitter.com\/parimalsatyal), arguing for a different variety of Web presence:\n\n> Modern web design principles are very rarely directed at regular people looking to make a website on something they are interested in. Instead, the focus is on creating websites that perform well:\n> *Don't use too many colours. Write short, catchy headlines. Don't let content be too long. Optimise for SEO. Produce video content, attention span is decreasing. Have a an obvious call to action. Push your newsletter. Keep important information above the fold. Don't make users think. Follow conventions.*\n\nI realize that the majority of Web utilization cannot \"revert\" to hand-coded plain HTML web pages hosted on Neocities, but there's something to be learned (or remembered, in my case) from Satyal's argument: **The Web's forgotten strength is <u>diversity<\/u>** (much like my country's, it would seem,) and the majority of users are being pushed by Google's search engine toward a very specific minority of URLs. We have not been *exploring* for a very long time:\n\n> Instead of browsing, the web is for many an endless and often overwhelming stream of content and commentary picked out by algorithms based on what they think you already like and will engage with. It's the opposite of exploration.\n\n\"It is worth remembering a website does not have to be a product; it can also be art,\" argues Satyal. \"The web is also a creative and cultural space that **need not confine itself to the conventions defined by commercial product design and marketing**.\" (Emphasis mine.) It's not just that The Web was *meant* to be more - nostalgia is definitely not my particular trip, if you didn't know - it's that it *can* be so much more. My [list of favorite Open Web projects](https:\/\/bilge.world\/open) contains just a few examples of what I mean.\n\nIt's possible I am being *too* critical of Google. A [Twitter search](https:\/\/twitter.com\/search?q=%22https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2020%2F5%2F28%2F21272543%2Fgoogle-search-results-page-experience-load-time-contentfu-paint-layout-shift-top-stories-amp%22&f=live) for the link to *The Verge*'s article reveals commentary like \"[Experience, matters ;)](https:\/\/twitter.com\/carlosriverao\/status\/1266051773472608257),\" \"[Web search moving forward](https:\/\/twitter.com\/markupgrade\/status\/1266492831218139137),\" and \"[Halleluja!](https:\/\/twitter.com\/reDDakteur\/status\/1266078587767177219),\" so there are clearly users who are more than onboard, and not all of what Google has done for the web recently has been detrimental. It was also announced last month that [Chrome will begin blocking \"resource-heavy\" advertisements](https:\/\/blog.chromium.org\/2020\/05\/resource-heavy-ads-in-chrome.html) by default and that [Google and Microsoft have been working together to improve spellcheck and scrolling in Chromium](https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2020\/5\/28\/21273934\/microsoft-google-chrome-edge-chromium-spellcheck-improvements). There's not much to feel about these announcements, but - as always - there is a whole lot to feel about Google as a company.\n\nGoogle has [announced](https:\/\/dev.to\/chromiumdev\/announcing-web-dev-live-a-three-day-digital-event-2640) a three-day live digital event at the end of this month (June 30th-July 2nd) in which viewers will \"celebrate our community's actions, learn modern web techniques and connect with each other.\" \"Over three days, we'll share quick tips on aspects of modern web development,\" explains the company on its [web.dev\/live page](https:\/\/web.dev\/live\/).

I've lived through many notable milestones in this regard: [Apple Mail](https:\/\/youtu.be\/vN4U5FqrOdQ?t=2321) on the original iPhone, [Gmail](https:\/\/time.com\/43263\/gmail-10th-anniversary\/), Readdle's [Spark](https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2015\/5\/29\/8683775\/spark-email-app-iphone-apple-watch), and (yes, really,) the revitalization of [Microsoft's Outlook](https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2018\/9\/4\/17819636\/microsoft-resdesigned-outlook-windows-web). Exciting innovations have abounded throughout email's history, but it's highly debatable whether or not any of them have really changed the way we use it in a profound way, yet I am unfailingly intrigued whenever somebody new comes along, so when I saw [Casey Newton's story](https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2020\/6\/15\/21286466\/hey-email-basecamp-price-availability-platforms-launch) on *The Verge*'s frontpage discussing Basecamp's [HEY](https:\/\/hey.com\/) before I got out of bed on the morning of June 15th, I was delighted to see an organization still had the courage to invest their confidence and resources into their Ideas About Email. Originally, [HEY's homepage](http:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20200510220647\/https:\/\/hey.com\/) included a prompt: \"To get on the list, email iwant@hey.com and tell us how you feel about email. Could be a love story, or a hate story. Could be long, could be short. It’s your story, so it’s up to you.\" Though I knew it'd likely never be read, I decided to write them a letter about my personal history with email, which turned into an entertaining enough anecdote to publish here.\n\n<iframe width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/UCeYTysLyGI?controls=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe>\n\nThe real reason HEY continued to be so widely covered by tech media, though, was its challenge to Apple's App Store policies after one of its updates was [rejected by the marketplace](https:\/\/www.protocol.com\/hey-email-app-store-rejection) just a day after Casey's story was published. Much drama ensued - I have done my best to aggregate links to all the news stories on the subject in [a thread](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/extratown\/comments\/hbncn6\/news_surrounding_hey_the_upcoming_email_service\/) on the [*Extratone* subreddit](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/extratown) I recently started. I think [the public resistance by Basecamp's CTO David Heinemeier Hansson](https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2020\/6\/16\/21293419\/hey-apple-rejection-ios-app-store-dhh-gangsters-antitrust) was probably a PR move, which is fine, but all I wanted to contribute was a review of the actual function of HEY, itself. After reading posts by some of my favorite bloggers, however, I think it would be redundant. Kev Quirk argued \"[Email Is Not Broken](https:\/\/kevq.uk\/email-is-not-broken\/),\" to which Mike Stone responded \"[Email Is Broken](https:\/\/mikestone.me\/email-is-broken).\" Additionally, *Business Insider*'s Lisa Eadicicco published an [in-depth review](https:\/\/www.businessinsider.com\/hey-email-app-review-basecamp-inbox-2020-7) at the beginning of the month.\n\nMy singular commentary: I'm worried that subscription services that exclusively accept large yearly sums like HEY inevitably become the \"country club for the most self-important emailers in business\" which Casey spoke of. I guess we'll see.\n\n*The following is an excerpt from [my letter to HEY](http:\/\/simp.ly\/p\/lw0h0R) asking for a early-access invite.*\n\n---\n\n## Email and I: An Abridged History\n\nI am 26 years old, so I suppose I'm of the first generation that's never experienced life *without* email. I grew up on a farm in rural central Missouri and my dad was very much an early adopter. (You'd be surprised how e-enabled farmers were becoming in the early 2000s.) I cannot remember life before the humongous satellite dish was anchored in our front yard. Long before I had any reason to be online (or really understood what that meant,) he began and ended every day sitting at in front of a CRT on a corner desk, clacking away on a cigarette smoke-yellowed plastic keyboard for hours. I did not understand why, then, but in retrospect I realize that he was corresponding with a huge network of neighbors, politicians, family, and college friends via email lists\/chains and that he depended on it both professionally and personally in a big way. As a single man living at least an hour's drive from a city of any size, I suppose my dad was predisposed to have a rich online life long before his suburban peers, which normalized it precociously for me.\n\nThe summer before my first grade year, my elementary school became the first in the district to have a computer lab (also the first air-conditioned room in the building,) so my high school graduating class was literally the very first to have had any digital curriculum - and an email address(!) - for the entirety of our public school experience. Because of this, I think most of us were trained to think of email as a tool for school work - it was eluded to by our computer teachers that our school email addresses were being monitored to make sure they remained so (obviously, they weren't.) As we grew into 6th-7th grade, however, we all seemed to end up with personal email addresses. I consider myself lucky to have experienced a very brief window - before instant messaging\/early social networks became mainstream and SMS became even remotely pleasant to use - when my middle school friends and I corresponded exclusively by email when we weren't on the phone.\n\nIt still sounds a bit silly to say, but I've spent the past few years coming to believe more and more strongly that my first-generation iPhone changed my life forever in a profound way - *especially* my relationship with email. After watching [Steve Job's introduction at MacWorld 2007](https:\/\/www.howtogeek.com\/674796\/how-to-archive-or-delete-a-facebook-group\/) live, I promised to skip a year of Christmas gifts if my mom would agreed to buy me one, and she did. Obviously, it was like nothing else I'd ever experienced, and it completely changed how I responded to and thought about technology. Before smartphones, there was no checking email outside of time in the computer lab, which was intended to be quite strictly-regulated. I had a real advantage when I started bringing my iPhone to school - absolutely no one knew what it was (a bizarre thought in contrast,) including teachers. Suddenly able to browse and read my inbox in class, at lunch, and on the bus, my use and consideration of email was propelled far ahead of my peers'.\n\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet tw-align-center\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/hashtag\/RealFriendsIn5Words?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#RealFriendsIn5Words<\/a> sent it to your email.<\/p>&mdash; David Blue (@NeoYokel) <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/NeoYokel\/status\/906468410976079872?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">September 9, 2017<\/a><\/blockquote> <script async src=\"https:\/\/platform.twitter.com\/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"><\/script>\n\nWhen I started an online magazine in 2016, I don't think I could've conceived of the extent to which running a modern media company - even one targeted toward tech-savvy, early-adopting youth - still involves email. I assumed that my audience rarely *actually read* from their inboxes and relied almost exclusively on social networks for content discovery, so I originally forwent any implementation of a newsletter. As I grew more and more interested in and engaged with the media beat, I was exposed to the email renaissance of the past 2-3 years thanks to services like Revue and Substack, saw that it was good, and decided to give it a try for myself. I launched our semi-regular newsletter in April, 2017 on the subjects of \"**Division**, **Art**, and **Media**\" and published a little over 30 issues over the course of 18 months. To be honest, I'm not sure I've ever had so much fun writing. \n\nVery shortly after it began, I observed our general engagement quadruple, and - quite selfishly - found the process of aggregation to be soothing and very mentally restorative. It exposed some pretty horrendous media consumption habits of mine, but it also offered a painless solution to them. As soon as everything I read became a potential item in the newsletter, I wasn't just reading for myself anymore (or at least, that's the mentality it gave me,) so I could no longer afford to dismiss particular subjects as easily or to skim so recklessly. I nurtured a much less chaotic media diet and found myself absorbing *a lot* more of what I wanted to without wasting so much time burning through links. I ended up feeling more focused in other, unrelated areas of my life, too. Obviously, I love email for that, and I miss writing that darn newsletter so much that I continuously look for excuses to do something similar.\n\nMy former Tech Editor loved email perhaps as much, but she's definitely the only person I've ever met who finds the medium as *entertaining* as I do. (If you're *really* committed, I just made a [Twitter Moment](https:\/\/twitter.com\/i\/events\/1272514574420500481?s=13) full of all the best stuff I've ever posted about email - mostly jokes like \"[patron saint of email marketing](https:\/\/twitter.com\/NeoYokel\/status\/921352650788130822),\" but there are one or two profound posts in there, too.) We realized one day that - aside from The Webbys - there are very few notable awards celebrating excellence in the email medium, so we decided our magazine would host the 2017 First Annual Email Awards. Unfortunately, I don't think anyone else had any idea what the heck we were trying to do, so we never received enough submissions. However, I noticed a great opening paragraph in the original announcement post which I thought made a worthy conclusion:\n\n> Man has used electronic mail to intercommunicate, woo, build communities, topple businesses & civilizations, embezzle money, spread worms, distribute cluttered, broken links to discontinued Orscheln products, feed infants, set climate control, confirm identities, check bank account statuses, and lie to exhausted, slightly-conceited, and *newly self-published* professors. That's right - These Trillions of simple digijewels have purveyed *every single possible category of human communication*, and it's still growing strong.\n\nI'm excited to give Hey a try - I hope you'll consider inviting me early. I'll even send my feedback if you so desire it! If not, I'll probably end up trying a paid subscription, anyway hehe. Either way, let me wish the best of luck to your team. Win or lose, I'm glad you're taking action on your complaints, unlike the rest of us.\n\nThank you!\n\n#software","views":1609,"updated":"2022-04-04T07:57:57Z","tags":["RealFriendsIn5Words","software"],"type":null,"title":"Email and I: An Abridged History","slug":"hey-email-history","appearance":"norm","language":"en","rtl":false,"created":"2020-07-22T19:36:07Z","images":["https:\/\/i.snap.as\/l7jhO5a.png"],"collection":{"public":false,"alias":"bilge","total_posts":0,"title":"The Psalms","verification_link":"","description":"A <a href=\"https:\/\/davidblue.wtf\/db.vcf\">narcoleptic yokel<\/a> on software and culture.","style_sheet":"","views":177027,"monetization_pointer":""},"paid":false},{"id":"gdqwfyka7qnwbx7y","body":"#### by [David Blue](https:\/\/twitter.com\/NeoYokel)\n\n![SoundCloud Tile](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/2eB6JrY.png)\n\nLast Tuesday, SoundCloud [announced](https:\/\/blog.soundcloud.com\/2020\/07\/14\/you-can-now-master-your-tracks-directly-on-soundcloud\/) the release of onsite, automated mastering [in cooperation with Dolby](https:\/\/news.dolby.com\/en-WW\/190438-master-your-tracks-directly-on-soundcloud-powered-by-dolby). The service will cost $4.99 per track for non-Pro Unlimited subscribers, who'll receive three free mastered tracks per month and $3.99 per track masters after that. After uploading a new track (less than 10 minutes in length,) users will see a small button labeled \"Master Track,\" which then takes them to a trimming interface that prompts them to select a 30-second, \"high contrast\" clip representing the dynamic extremes of the track, which is then locked in as the singular preview for the service. After \"listening\"\/analyzing said clip, the user is brought to the mastering interface and prompted to select between four presets:\n\n**Thunder**\n\"Make car speakers rumble and club systems shake. This option will push your bass frequencies to the limit.\"\n\n**Sunroof**\n\"Open up your mid and high frequencies and bring some life to your transients.

Though I definitely left my quite severe obsession with WWII history in my prepubescence, I thought I'd remark on this film because I originally hoped it would fulfill a role I'd long wanted for: the destroyer-side compliment to U-boat films like [*Das Boot*](https:\/\/letterboxd.com\/film\/das-boot\/) and [*U-571*](https:\/\/letterboxd.com\/film\/u-571\/). James D. Hornfischer's exceptional account of the [U.S.S. Samuel B. Roberts](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/USS_Samuel_B._Roberts_(DE-413))' part in [The Battle off Samar](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Battle_off_Samar) with [*The Last Stand of the Tin Can Sailors*](http:\/\/www.randomhousebooks.com\/books\/82865) was my last dive into naval history. It's one of the most astounding war stories I've ever encountered, and upon first seeing [*Greyhound*'s trailer](https:\/\/youtu.be\/eyzxu26-Wqk), I was sortof hoping it was the Big Boy film adaptation its always warranted. (Though apparently there was a [TV movie](https:\/\/www.imdb.com\/title\/tt1068999\/) made in 2005???) Instead, its based on (distinct from \"adapted from,\" apparently) a 1955 novel by English author C.S. Forester entitled [*The Good Shepherd*](https:\/\/cdn.discordapp.com\/attachments\/260852968364965888\/737932123159265300\/The_Good_Shepherd_-_C.S._Forester.pdf).\n\nTom Hanks made sure to imbue his first screenplay with a *shitload* of \"[opaque naval jargon](https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/film\/2020\/jul\/06\/greyhound-review-tom-hanks-second-world-war-film),\" as *The Guardian*'s Peter Bradshaw's review put it. A brief [\"investigation\" by *The Cinemaholic*](https:\/\/www.thecinemaholic.com\/greyhound-ship-world-war-ii\/) suggests that the U.S.S. Keeling - the film's singular setting - most resembles a [*Mahan*-class destroyer](http:\/\/destroyerhistory.org\/goldplater\/mahanclass\/), though none actually bore the name. For the actual photography, the production made use of a surviving example of the [most mass-produced destroyer](http:\/\/destroyerhistory.org\/goldplater\/mahanclass\/) of all time:\n\n> When it came to shooting the film, instead of relying completely on sets, the crew of ‘Greyhound’ found another option. They used USS Kidd, a real WWII destroyer, to film the journey of Greyhound. She is a Fletcher-class destroyer and is named after Rear Admiral Isaac C. Kidd, the first US flag officer to die during the Second World War.\n\nAs much as you're going to loathe it, I must include this commentary on *Greyhound*'s historical accuracy if only because - as a undoubtedly mainstream film - its been so widely and competently reviewed, already, by real film writers. I am almost positive U-boats would rarely - if ever - waste their precious few viable torpedo shots firing ultra-close-range at the agile, super-speedy destroyers and destroyer escorts that protected supply convoys, and I am *sure* that none ever bothered with *audibly addressing enemy ships* over the radio in English. I understand that dramatizing historic events is the core function of *Greyhound*'s genre, but this particular addition was so unbearably cheesy that it utterly decimates all of the experience's hard-won context. Just look at a snippet from the first of two dialogues in text:\n\n> Greyhound. Greyhound, Greyhound.\n>\n> This is Gray Wolf.\n>\n> We hunt you and your friends\n> Eagle, Dicky and Harry.\n>\n> We watch your ships sinking into the deep.\n>\n> We hear the screams of your comrades\n> as they die.\n>\n> How many of them will there be\n> before you join them?\n>\n> The Gray Wolf is so very hungry.\n\nI'm sure there's an essential academic film function which only similar enemy taunts could perform and without which this screenplay would've been *technically* unsound, and - if I were allowed supposition - I would venture to guess that America's Favorite Dad felt pressured to bolster his first penning against easy gimmes for the Great Big institution of cinema criticism as much as possible. *However*, this shit is just disruptingly cheesy. Fuck it! Have the rest:\n\n> Greyhound!\n>\n> Your flock is not safe from this wolf.\n>\n> We can always find you\n> in the night to kill you.\n>\n> Or will Dicky die next? Or Harry?\n>\n> [Gray Wolf howls]\n>\n> ...\n>\n> Greyhound.\n>\n> Guten Morgen, Greyhound.\n>\n> Did you think you had slipped away\n> from this Gray Wolf?\n>\n> No, you did not. You will not.\n>\n> The sea favors the Gray Wolf on the hunt,\n> not the hound on the run.\n>\n> You and your comrades will die today.\n\nThe contrast with the rest of the script's imposingly thorough and relentlessly-paced naval action dialogue is far too abrupt to *not* be problematic. Even as obsessed as I was with naval history, I'm still too oblivious to the details of what is\/was actually said on the bridge of a warship during combat maneuvers to tell you how authentic *Greyhound*'s depiction really is (it's hardly ever shown on the screen or laid out in nonfiction, even,) which nullifies all relevance the realism would've had, otherwise. Director Aaron Schneider in [an interview for *Vanity Fair*](https:\/\/www.vanityfair.com\/hollywood\/2020\/07\/greyhound-movie-tom-hanks-aaron-schneider):\n\n> “If you decide to read *Greyhound* by tracking the dialogue—rudder commands and sonar distances—you’ll soon find yourself completely lost. Because that’s not where the movie lives. This screenplay was designed to beam you aboard the USS *Keeling*…and it’s up to you to engage with what’s going on and extrapolate how things work, so you can answer the question, ‘What the hell is going on here?’\"\n\nIn this sense - crafting a consuming, believable, unbelievably gray, claustrophobic, icing iron reality - Tom Hanks excels.\n\n<iframe width=\"auto\" height=\"265\" src=\"https:\/\/clyp.it\/p1tb3ssl\/widget\" frameborder=\"0\"><\/iframe>\n\nThough Letterboxd user [brucewayn](https:\/\/letterboxd.com\/brucewayn\/) called it \"boring\" in [the most popular review of the film](https:\/\/letterboxd.com\/brucewayn\/film\/greyhound\/) to date on the platform, I found *Greyhound* to be quite engaging in an anxious, depressing sense familiar to classic war dramas like *Saving Private Ryan* and *Black Hawk Down*. The tedium of naval warfare's endless orienteering is rescaled to a battlefield of lesser distances - axis and allied vessels actually collide on several occasions and a U-boat crew decides to *fuck it all* and brawl it out with two parallel destroyers with surface guns instead of retreating after losing their ability to dive. (See: [*Titanic VI*](https:\/\/youtu.be\/4uOcE_IIi30).) Through a combination of wartime compression and stitching, *Greyhound* is in large part a mashup of naval action at the extremes of what historical fiction will allow within its 48-hour setting. From Ben Lindbergh's [review for *The Ringer*](https:\/\/www.theringer.com\/movies\/2020\/7\/9\/21318481\/tom-hanks-greyhound-review):\n\n> In *The Good Shepherd*, enemy torpedoes simply sail wide; in the movie, they graze the hull for even closer calls. In the book, Krause agonizes over, and generally resists, calling the crew to general quarters, wary of exhausting their energy reserves; in the movie, he doesn’t hesitate to summon his sailors to battle stations.\n\nThe result is an emotionally effective film constrained by a very specific dramatic aim: another war movie every father can juice for decades' worth of Sunday afternoons on the sofa. \"As befits his status as America's Dad, Hanks has constructed for us the ultimate Dad Movie — all the action you could ever need or want, with no annoying characters hanging around, harboring pesky needs and wants of their own,\" [quips Glen Weldon for *NPR*](https:\/\/www.npr.org\/2020\/07\/10\/888899608\/world-war-ii-naval-drama-greyhound-charts-a-trim-efficient-course). Undoubtedly, though, the subject matter is fresh. I wouldn't say my youth desire for a surface-side Atlantic-theatre film is 100% satiated, but *Greyhound* managed to accomplish much more than I expected.\n\n#film","views":1749,"updated":"2022-04-04T07:57:49Z","tags":["film"],"type":null,"title":"'Greyhound''s Top-Side Pot Shot","slug":"greyhound-tom-hanks","appearance":"norm","language":"en","rtl":false,"created":"2020-07-29T16:31:15Z","images":["https:\/\/i.snap.as\/HmoHf1B.jpg"],"collection":{"public":false,"alias":"bilge","total_posts":0,"title":"The Psalms","verification_link":"","description":"A <a href=\"https:\/\/davidblue.wtf\/db.vcf\">narcoleptic yokel<\/a> on software and culture.","style_sheet":"","views":177027,"monetization_pointer":""},"paid":false},{"id":"d9g3r8kf9lm910hk","body":"![SoundCloud Tile](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/2eB6JrY.png) \n\n## I’ve got some fucking opinions about SoundCloud… \n\n<!--more-->\n\nMy friend Sierra has used SoundCloud almost exclusively for her music discovery, consumption, and recommendations, but has remained resolute in her unwillingness to financially invest in the service. As such, her listening is regularly interrupted by ads and limited to bitrates [as low as 64kbps](https:\/\/www.magneticmag.com\/2018\/01\/soundcloud-lowers-sound-quality-uploads-half\/). Since I was last employed, I have maintained a vow to her that I would pay for a subscription to SoundCloud Go+ – the premium _listener_ tier of the service – with my own money, once I was once again in place at a steady job. This move would remove all advertising from her listening and [up its bitrate to 256kbps](https:\/\/help.soundcloud.com\/hc\/en-us\/articles\/360010227514-High-Quality-Streaming), among [other benefits](https:\/\/checkout.soundcloud.com\/go).\n\nTwo nights ago, we were refueling her car in preparation for another one of our recreational drives into rural Missouri when I made the decision on a whim to simply signup for a trial of Go+ on [my own account](https:\/\/soundcloud.com\/chordoslut) using Apple Pay, mostly because I knew we’d be going out of effective cell network range and one of Go+’s most emphasized features is its ability to download music locally. (Since my Apple Music subscription expired earlier this year, I only have [a single album](https:\/\/bigkrit.com\/music\/king-remembered-in-time\/) actually downloaded on my phone.)\n\nhttps:\/\/soundcloud.com\/keithjarrettofficial\/rio-part-v\n\n***\nThe above is what I wrote several weeks ago, just as I was beginning my trial period. Now, having experienced a significant amount of time as a SoundCloud Go user, I am a bit sad that my trial is over. To be honest, I fully intended to become a paying subscriber, but my PayPal account was $0.70 short of the $12.99 monthly fee when the first billing cycle came, two weeks ago. This is not a conclusion I expected to come to, as SoundCloud’s fundamental arrangement could not possibly differ any more from the music streaming service I long claimed as my ideal own: Apple Music.\n\nOne major worry I would imagine potential subscribers may have when approaching SoundCloud as a replacement for their single music subscription service would revolve around the extent of SoundCloud’s establishment music industry library. There’s no way your Dad’s Sunday barbecue playlist is going to be on _SoundCloud_, right? Strangely enough, I was unable to find a single track that _was not_ in the library. From my own favorite [Keith Jarrett’s archives](https:\/\/soundcloud.com\/keithjarrettofficial) to [the new Dixie Chicks album](https:\/\/soundcloud.com\/dixiechicks\/sets\/gaslighter-2), every bit of big time record label-distributed music I could conceieve of could be found aside the Go+ badge (though notably, neither of these showed significant playcounts.) As far as the app experience goes, I _swear_ it got smoother as soon as I signed up for Go+. This is probably bullshit, but regardless, with the seemingly ever-widening disparity in the experiences of free vs. premium users, SoundCloud appears to be moving actively away from the former.\n\n![SoundCloud Desktop Keyboard Shortcuts](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/78HwnfKK.png)\n\nI have long said (somewhat in jest) that [Chance The Rapper](https:\/\/soundcloud.com\/chancetherapper) is the only reason SoundCloud still exists.\n\n> From a future historian’s perspective, the battle for the definitive name in independent digital music distribution has already won, largely thanks to its relationship with Chance The Rapper, who’s quickly become a “cultural influencer, thought leader, global star,” and one of my generation’s upmost celebrity champions. Obviously, there is little sense trying to determine whether SoundCloud _earned_ his partnership or landed their popular association with his name as long as the artist maintains it publicly, while continuing to [give new meaning](https:\/\/soundcloud.com\/pitchfork\/pitchfork-presents-in-sight-out-chance-the-rapper) to the phrase “serially likable.”\n-“[Bandcamp: Streaming’s Secret Savior](https:\/\/bilge.world\/bandcamp-streaming-music)” | July, 2018\n\nIf _[CNET_ was asking the question](https:\/\/www.cnet.com\/news\/chance-the-rapper-soundcloud\/) a year before that Bandcamp essay, I think I can feel properly varified. What I’d really like to know, now: does Chance still feel the same way about the streaming service after the launch of SoundCloud Go+? Considering that I am far from a _real_ music journalist, I do not have any more contact resources than you have. That said, I left [a comment on his Facebook Page](https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/chancetherapper\/posts\/3299672310124810?comment_id=3319045628187478). I guess we’ll see.\n\nSome more technical bits: SoundCloud is now castable on Chromecast, but _not_ supported by Apple CarPlay, for whatever that’s worth. Notably apart from Bandcamp and Apple Music and aligned with Spotify, SoundCloud is explicitly investing in algorithmic music discovery, which means its users are doing the curatorial work. _I_ am doing\/have done the curatorial work. That means the DnB crowd is going to receieve Toto recommendations, given what I sought out for this post. You’re welcome, and sorry…\n\n  1. While I was surprisingly unable to find any Tweets or Evernotes further evangelizing Apple Music (I suspect I’m thinking of an old, untranscribed _Drycast_ episode,) I found real magic in the service as I perceieved it: $9.99 a month for _all of iTunes_. 13 year-old me would considerthat one helluva deal.\n  2. Naturally, if you know of one, please do comment and\/or [drop me a line](https:\/\/www.davidblue.wtf\/contact\/).\n  3.

I found less than I expected, to be honest, but I did discover this particularly eloquent grab from [The Bandcamp Essay](https:\/\/bilge.world\/bandcamp-streaming-music):\n\n> **I can think of little more reductive, repugnant, reckless, or racist crusades as a model figure than indoctrinating your child with an inherent distaste for their own culture**, and nothing more deeply alarming to hear from the mouth of someone born in the 21st century than shit like \"Queen was better than any rapper will ever be,\" or \"real musicianship will die forever with Eric Clapton.\" It's unfair and unnatural: imagine if your high school classmates had consistently turned up their scrunched nose at the living whole of rock & roll, declaring Scott Joplin to be the last musician they could stand.\n\nI am in no position to act like a culture writer,[^1] nor have I ever been enough of an authority on any sort of music to be a real music journalist. As I sat attempting to zoom back out and quantify precisely *why* I wanted to include this in the second chapter of this particular book (writing by hand, for once,) in a notebook by hand for once, though, I arrived for the first time upon the realization that this subject has genuinely, profoundly disturbed me for a very long time -- definitively longer than any of the others. I was sharp when I touched upon it in The Bandcamp Essay, but *actually* going back and revisiting those experiences with very young men evangelizing classic rock as the penultimate musical expression of mankind suggested that I was really concealing a deep-set, alarming concern behind the peeved wit.\n\n> This issue is not unique to American society nor to men, really, but is entirely the sickness of white boomers and gen Xers. It is an anomaly that has genuinely and profoundly perturbed me for virtually the entirety of my existence as a culturally literate entity -- certainly longer than any of the other disturbances addressed in this volume.\n- From my notes on the subject, today.\n\nIf I have progressed on this issue in the past two years, it's been with an acceptance that it *really is* and has been *happening* at scale in this country and far too many others for *decades*, now. That is, the natural progression of a whole generation's cultural identity has been dramatically molested.[^2] Never in the history of Western civilization has an elderly generation managed to convince the proceeding *several* that *their* culture is objectively superior to that of the descendants. Yes, there have always been those young people who comfortably and unironically describe themselves as *old souls* -- hiding behind this foul moniker from their perception of cultural\/technological progression's pressure to assimilate ideas too challenging to acknowledge, but never have they occupied a double-digit percentage of the youth, nor have they been so romanticized by mainstream culture.\n\nScott Joplin evangelists overtaking high school bands in the 1960s has been my favored hypothetical for far too long, so let me instead step a foot into another medium and use the television series *Stranger Things*. According to [its Wikipedia page](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Stranger_Things) (I am *not* going to spend my time actually citing correctly, sorry,) the first season premiered on July 15th, 2016, which is 33 years ahead of its quoted original setting of November 1983. An equivalent: imagine if American sailors stationed at Pearl Harbor in 1941 were obsessively watching\/discussing the original, silent 1908 film [*Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde*](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Dr._Jekyll_and_Mr._Hyde_(1908_film)).

As I've discovered that one can relatively easily find a beta version of virtually _any_ piece of software, it's become a bit of a habit for me. More or less unconsciously, I’ve ended up with an application library full of _Developer Beta_ and _Nightly_ _Build_\\-type shit. I don't think there was\/is a single web browser installed on that machine that is not the given entity's \"Developer Edition\" which - considering most of the regular installs allow you to opt into dev tools, anyway - seem like they might be redundant.

Here they are!\n\nIt all began when my Surface's integrated webcam became invisible to all applications that used a video input - including Microsoft's own Camera app and OBS. It showed up in Device Manger, where I did the generally-recommended troubleshooting task of uninstalling it completely (including its drivers) and rebooting to force Windows to reinstall it. It did so successfully every time, to no effect on the original issue. I also went into the Surface's BIOS menu, where its hardware devices are explicitly listed, and disabled\/re-enabled the camera, to no effect. Normally, the absence of a webcam function would be more or less irrelevant to my day-to-day workflow, but now that [I'm partaking in \"virtual\" college courses](https:\/\/www.davidblue.wtf\/college-return\/), at least one of my professors has pressured me to appear _on cam_ as soon as possible.\n\nOn Sunday night, I decided to revisit the problem with greater commitment, diving into a variety of deeper troubleshooting steps which I do not recall. The crucial one, though, was my decision to use the System File Checker tool ``(sfc \/scannow)`` with the added instruction to _fix_ whatever errors it found.[^2] This drove my dearest little laptop into a cycle of self-diagnoses which results in an option screen including \"Reset PC.\" After trying virtually every other option, I decided to try resetting, only to be met with connectivity error messages after pursuing the \"Install via Network\" option, leaving the use of a bootable Windows 10 recovery USB as my only choice, in theory.\n\nAnother problem now arose: my mother's MacBook Pro is the only other machine I have any sort of access to at the moment, and MacOS no longer supports the creation of such a bootable USB for Windows via the Boot Camp Utility any longer.

As per my favorite tradition of new computer acquisition, I have named the machine after [Hildur Odegard](https:\/\/fortitude.fandom.com\/wiki\/Hildur_Odegard) from _Fortitude_.\n\n## \"First Impressions\"\n\nIt's been exactly 10 years since I last bought a desktop tower - since I first set hands on the Dell XPS Studio desktop with which I would create the majority of my intellectual property - and I was immediately surprised by how much smaller (6.12 x 11.93 x 13.28 inches) and lighter (13.12 lbs.) this tower was than my expectations. The display, too, is remarkably light and thin. Rationally, I should not have been surprised by this, but I'm not going to punish myself for continuing to find any sort of magic in technology.\n\nIn the box were a Bluetooth keyboard - specifically, an HP model [4251a-khsap003k](https:\/\/fccid.io\/EMJKHSA-P003K) - and mouse set, the latter of which I will hopefully never have to use, thanks to my [Logitech G203](https:\/\/youtu.be\/oIAY1-aW8Es) - and was perplexed by the process of how to pair the former with the tower while it was in setup mode for far too long. I was just about to give up entirely when I revisited the packaging and noticed what I'd previously assumed was an anti-theft device, but was actually the fucking dongle for the pair. I continue to despise Bluetooth peripherals, obviously, but the multimedia function keys of the product led to some important realizations: I now had reason to use Windows Desktop Switching _and_ have a calculator application again! However, I have yet to figure out how to alter the Function key's behavior (I'm not even sure it's possible:) in order to input **Alt+F4**, I have to input **Fn+Alt+F4**, which is far too clunky to depend on. The issue did lead to a revelation which I may or may not integrate permanently: I mapped **Alt+F4** to the previously-unused button on the very top of the G203. So far, it's been pretty nifty.\n\n![HP 4251a-khsap003k](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/2kLqJ1uB.jpg)\n\n*The HP 4251a-khsap003k included in the box with my new HP desktop.*\n\nThat said, a component of my intention to create an intentional, static, upright-sitting desktop workspace included an allotment for a quality mechanical keyboard - my justification was that any professional in a particular craft makes a point to have the best possible tools for the job, so a high-quality keyboard has actually been _very_ long overdue, in my case. So, I sought out [a single _Wirecutter_ recommendations list](https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/wirecutter\/reviews\/our-favorite-mechanical-keyboards\/) and even attempted to disseminate [r\/MechanicalKeyboards](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/MechanicalKeyboards\/).[^2] After a brief jaunt, I concluded that no reasonable person would be able to make heads or tails of the forum or [its seemingly endless wikis](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/MechanicalKeyboards\/wiki\/index) without considerable indoctrination so I more or less threw a dart and landed on the [Varmilo VA108M](https:\/\/mechanicalkeyboards.com\/shop\/index.php?l=product_detail&p=3504), which I ordered. All I know is that it's fairly highly-reviewed on the marketplaces I checked (though hardly mentioned on the subreddit, actually,) and that it has the _Cherry Switches_, which are... [The good ones](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/MechanicalKeyboards\/comments\/d3hmw3\/my_new_baby_varmilo_108m_cherry_mx_blues_the\/).\n\nA concern I originally had with taking over the tertiary guest room - by far the smallest allotted living space in the house - as my office was its distance from our wireless router, two floors down. The last time I used the room as a workspace (five years ago,) my old tower's integrated WiFi card often struggled to maintain a reliable connection. The adapter included in this desktop, though, actually managed to clock [the fastest download speed on my SpeedTest.net records](https:\/\/www.speedtest.net\/result\/10021332678) just now.\n\n![SpeedTest Results](https:\/\/www.speedtest.net\/result\/10021332678.png)\n\nSomehow, I just managed to clock the [highest download speed on my record](https:\/\/www.speedtest.net\/result\/10021332678) from two floors up!\n\n## Bad(ish)\n\nIt's almost painful even to write this but... As beautiful as this $250 display is to behold, I've grown accustomed to my [Surface Laptop 2](https:\/\/www.microsoft.com\/en-us\/surface\/business\/surface-laptop-2)'s **2256 x 1504 13\"** display after years of hard, daily use. Apparently, those dimensions mean the little machine's display has a pixel density of **201 Pixels-Per-Inch**. Filling a **27\"** display with just **1920 x 1080** means a pixel density of just **81.6 Pixels-Per-Inch**,[^3] and the disparity was glaring to my eyes, even from the setup screen. After a few hours of regular use, I'm not sure I notice it anymore, but I suspect I will again when I've got the laptop running again. Please do indicate whether or not you think such a complaint makes me awful in the [Crowdsignal poll](https:\/\/poll.fm\/10603399) below.\n\nhttps:\/\/twitter.com\/NeoYokel\/status\/1301337431887708162\n\nI've also already had trouble connecting my [Bose SoundLink headphones](https:\/\/www.bose.com\/en_us\/support\/products\/bose_headphones_support\/bose_around_ear_headphones_support\/soundlink-around-ear-wireless-headphones-ii.html) correctly via Bluetooth. On my Surface Laptop, it registered as two separate devices - \"Stereo Headphones\" and \"Headset\" - which allowed me to use them as both the primary audio output _and_ the primary audio input. For whatever reason, I have been unable to accomplish such a simultaneous connection on this machine: I can either connect them as headphones or as a headset, but not both. [This video](https:\/\/youtu.be\/55yn-zF_dZY) provided some help - I know now that I have to open Sound Settings and manually connect the headphones every time I re-connect them. Hopefully, I'll figure out another solution soon.\n\nReturning to the webcam issue: I discovered that absolutely _zero_ local stores keep add-on webcams in stock anymore, which makes sense. I resorted to searching Amazon for webcams and found a gargantuan list of brands I had never heard of. When I filtered by the one I _did_ recognize - Logitech - I saw barely-facelifted versions of the camera my stepdad bought in 2008 and none were in stock. Unwilling to further investigate or research more, I set the price filter for under $40, sorted by customer ratings, and bought the first product which had even remotely legitimate-looking reviews: [this 1080p _thing_](https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/B08BQZT4N8\/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) branded with \"Mersuii.\"\n\nAfter returning to the order invoice hours later for this post, I got curious enough to Google search the company name and discovered a dead-end url, zero Wikipedia page, and [this Trademark registration](https:\/\/trademarks.justia.com\/863\/53\/mersuii-86353116.html), on which I spotted some very interesting information.

It occurred to me that folks who spend a lot of time doing things that require tools - _professionals_, artisans, craftsmen, etc. - usually seek out the best possible quality offerings of those tools. Even if they're just 5% better than the average alternatives and cost twice as much, when one uses them for hours every day, the last bit of refinement pays off very quickly. Considering how much typing I've done in the past 5-10 years, I find it a bit silly that I hadn't before thought to optimize the hardware I've used to do so. Now that I've put at least some thought into designing the space in which I work and [gone back to school](https:\/\/www.davidblue.wtf\/college-return\/), I've also invested in bettering the thing my hands actually touch the most.\n\n##### Actually... Before I go on, [here is the link](https:\/\/documentcloud.adobe.com\/link\/review?uri=urn:aaid:scds:US:497d6e70-60df-4087-a3e5-af91077bec15https:\/\/documentcloud.adobe.com\/link\/review?uri=urn:aaid:scds:US:497d6e70-60df-4087-a3e5-af91077bec15) to the Varmilo VA108M User Manual\/Guide\/Reference in English in case that's what you came looking for. (I had difficulty finding it, too.)\n\nI suppose I've let myself be blinded to the advantages of a mechanical keyboard by the _gaemer_ stigma that surrounds them. This time, I believe I began by simply inputting something like \"best keyboard for typing\" into a search engine, which returns plenty of iffy results, naturally, but among them was [a list from _Wirecutter_](https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/wirecutter\/reviews\/our-favorite-mechanical-keyboards\/) - whom I trust, more or less - of \"Best Mechanical Keyboards 2020.\" Also included were posts in the [r\/MechanicalKeyboards subreddit](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/MechanicalKeyboards\/), which I _actually fucking joined_[^1] (but promise never to mention again outside of this post.) Uncovering my eyes, I found a ridiculously-extensive community message board and [Wiki](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/MechanicalKeyboards\/wiki), which is undoubtedly the most extensive resource on the subject to be found, anywhere. Though I did place a time limit on myself for any research of 15 minutes, in retrospect, I suppose I also had some criteria, which I assume - if you're still reading - you might be interested in:\n\n- **WIRED** as fuck. Bluetooth can _fuck off_.\n- \"Full\" keyboard, for the same reason I'd never spend any money on a piano with any less than 88 keys.\n- At least tolerably tasteful, aesthetically. (Not overwhelmingly embarrassing if someone were to actually see me using it.)\n- Cute, ideally.\n- No light shows.\n- Not \"ergonomic.\"\n- Not from Logitech or Microsoft.\n\nImmediately, it was overwhelmingly clear that my choice must also have _The Cherry_... The Cherries... The \"Cherry MX Switches,\" whatever they are. _Any_ of even the most skimmy reading up on the subject will lead you to this conclusion. That addressed, I arrived upon three considerations: the [Ducky One 2](https:\/\/www.duckychannel.com.tw\/en\/Ducky-One2-RGB-TKL), [Das Keyboard Model S Professional](https:\/\/www.daskeyboard.com\/model-s-professional\/), and [Varmilo VA87M](http:\/\/blog.piaw.net\/2017\/12\/review-varmilo-va87m-wired-keyboard.html).\n\n![Varmilo VA108M (Overhead)](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/Tef4WBLJ.jpg)\n\n*Layout of the VA108M seen from above.*\n\nAs good as the idea of something as German as the Das Keyboard sounded, I hate the way it looks, and the Ducky seemed to take itself too seriously (despite its brand name.) The VA87M seemed to be ideal if it was full-sized. I searched for the equivalent, [found the VA108M](http:\/\/mechanicalkeyboards.com\/shop\/index.php?l=product_detail&p=2855), and bought one immediately.

The Photos app improvements were very welcome, but I’d departed from iCloud as my primary storage service, so I didn’t have anything relevant to say. iOS 14 is also mostly irrelevant to my own personal use, but represents a more abstract shift in design philosophy that I thought was worth commenting on. For myself, everything about it adds anxiety, beginning with the launch, itself, at [Apple’s WWDC 2020](https:\/\/youtu.be\/GEZhD3J89ZE), which I watched, live, and [Tweeted extensively about](https:\/\/twitter.com\/i\/events\/1275137514609823751?s=20).\n\n## I do not want to live on the Memoji planet.\n\nMy technology writing over the years has largely centered around my awe and confusion regarding what I've perceived as a divergent path from the future I once imagined. My closest guess as to this divergence's origin is the announcement of iOS7, with Apple's [abandonment of skeuomorphic design](https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/technology\/shortcuts\/2013\/jun\/12\/skeuomorphism-apple-ditched-ios7) in favor of an entirely new, \"flatter\" UX visual language, which I actually found quite jarring. [In retrospect](https:\/\/snap.as\/extratone\/retrospective), though, of course I'm glad they did so. I thought this was an importat preface to any thoughts I have about [today's WWDC Keynote](https:\/\/youtu.be\/GEZhD3J89ZE) - they will probably seem idiotic in a year or so (they might to you already.)\n\nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=i243Fn1HwOY\n\nThanks to The Big Beer Virus, this was Apple's first pre-recorded WWDC presentation (though the word \"live\" continued to be used on several occasions,) which made it especially surreal. During the wait for the Keynote to \"go live,\" the stream was occupied by an [animated Earth](https:\/\/twitter.com\/GoncaloCdM\/status\/1275110234000969728) from orbit. As the clock rolled over the hour's top, AURORA's \"[Daydreamer](https:\/\/song.link\/us\/i\/1457598185)\" faded in and we began to grow closer to this Earth, gradually revealing that it was covered with millions of floating memoji in various states behind their animated MacBooks. Like much of the event to follow, this scene became more and more anxiety-inducing as we grew closer to the mob (keep in mind that I've never really found memoji cute, unlike plenty of folks.) Eventually, we changed pitch dramatically and plunged through a hole in the clouds straight toward the incenter of the spaceship at Apple Park, through the door, down the staircase, and into a completely empty - but fully lit - Steve Jobs theatre, where Tim Cook emerged on stage and almost immediately began to [address racism](https:\/\/www.inputmag.com\/tech\/apple-wwdc-virtual-event-tim-cook-addresses-black-lives-matter-racism).\n\nhttps:\/\/twitter.com\/NeoYokel\/status\/1275178772921270275\n\nThis disorganization of [Craig Federighi's Homescreen](https:\/\/twitter.com\/NeoYokel\/status\/1275178772921270275) shown in the presentation exemplifies the entire aura of this update: it’s complicated. _The Verge_’s Dieter Bohn receives this new complication positively in an [excellent essay](https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2020\/6\/24\/21299924\/ios-14-iphone-wwdc-2020-apple-home-screen-widgets-app-library-clips-pages-complexity) dedicated to the topic, divided into **Widgets on The Home Screen**, **Jiggle Mode** and **Editing Pages**, the **App Library**, and **App Clips**. (Yes, in many ways, linking to the essay makes this post redundant.)\n\n---\n\nThat's what I wrote about WWDC. iOS 14 officially released five days ago, now, and folks are already showcasing some crazy homescreen modifications on Twitter in [#ios14homescreen](https:\/\/twitter.com\/search?q=%23ios14homescreen&src=typeahead_click&f=image). I would go into detail, but I'm honestly not all that curious about the process, which is unusual. I hope more than anything that I am not loosing my curiosity or playfulness regarding iOS which not so long ago propelled [an exuberant exploration of Shortcuts' capabilities](https:\/\/bilge.world\/siri-shortcuts-ios12-review) during their early days as an integrated Apple property with the release of iOS 12.\n\nhttps:\/\/twitter.com\/ragulover123\/status\/1307461503948394496\n\nBasically, I'm not going to do the full bit, this year, but I'd like to address some of the notes I _did_ take throughout the past few months of the developer beta. Notably, there is simply far less to iOS 14 that's relevant to my life, personally, than any other release I remember, _but that's okay_. It's just a wee bit more difficult to motivate myself to talk about it. If there's one definite statement to be made about this release, it's that **it is _additive_ rather than _transformative_**. As Dieter Bohn so elequently put it for _The Verge_:\n\n> For the iPhone, the overarching theme is that they're finally letting it get complicated. The home screen starts simple, but it can be complex if you want it to and Apple's also finally putting different elements on top of other elements so you can see Siri on top of your current screen instead of taking over the whole screen.\n>\n> \"[iOS and iPadOS 14 public beta preview: something for everybody](https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/21317904\/ios-ipados-14-public-beta-preview-scribble-home-screen-widgets-apple-maps)\" | _The Verge_\n\n_Yes, I do find the title of that article quite ironic considering what I just articulated to you._\n\nThe title of [his penultimate review](https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2020\/6\/24\/21299924\/ios-14-iphone-wwdc-2020-apple-home-screen-widgets-app-library-clips-pages-complexity), additionally, includes the summation \"Apple is finally lettting the iPhone homescreen get complicated.\" Yes... _Complexity_. I'll be honest: I've actually had the opportunity to play around quite a bit with Android 11 thanks to Android Studio on my PCs, and I found it tremendously underwhelming as an alternative. On a virtual Pixel 3, the experience was functionally no more than a fucking _material design_\\-tasting, _slightly_ varied execution of a smartphone operating system in comparison. I should disclaim, though, that these weeks with early iOS widget implementation - which represents quite a hefty chunk of this release's significance, I think we can all agree - have led me to the conclusion that I personally _do not believe_ in widgets. Or at least - I do not have the usership vocabulary to even begin integrating them into my own handset-using life.\\[efn\\_note\\]I'd elaborate but honestly, who cares, really?\\[\/efn\\_note\\]\n\nTo focus a bit, let's look specifically at a _Gizmodo_ article published this past Wednesday: \"[17 Things You Can Do in iOS 14 That You Couldn’t Do Before](https:\/\/gizmodo.com\/17-things-you-can-do-in-ios-14-that-you-couldn-t-do-bef-1844975020):\"\n\n1. **App Clips**: Oh boy... I'm so physically, mentally, and spiritually exhausted. Just gonna say _no_ to that one.\n2. **Add widgets to the home screen**: I'm going to assume it's Android users who've stigmatised dynamic home screen widgets as a desirable outlet of development resources. I simply cannot fathom any bit of data which would be truly be _constructively_ consumed there, as opposed to unlocking the device and navigating to whatever application it originated from. Perhaps I'm just old and slow.\n3. **Send apps to the App Library**: Directly related, actually. Still considering how I assume most folks actually navigate to applications that have been in folders or in secondary+ homescreens to date - that is, dragging down and typing a handful of characters into Spotlight search - I'm not sure an alphabetized listing of all apps is really that useful. I know I'm not alone on this one: iJustine expressed an identical assumption [on an episode of her podcast, _Same Brain_](https:\/\/anchor.fm\/samebrain\/episodes\/WWDC-Rumors--PS5-hype-and-Animal-Crossing-efmf8f).\n4. **Hide some of your home screens**: (I repeat the exact same argument.)\n5. **Watch videos with picture-in-picture mode**: Once again, I could definitely be showing my age, but what really constitues _watching_ when you're talking about a fractional segment of a ~6 inch display? You may as well just be listening to the audio, right?\n6. **Pin conversations in Messages**: I'm afraid the text conversation pinning feature doesn't really apply to someone like myself, who literally never messages anyone but my girlfriend and my mom. All pinning the conversations accomplishes for me is the obfuscation of the handy in-line timestamp found in the normal list view.\n7. **Mention your contacts in Messages**: Jesus... And we're still using fucking _SMS_?\n8. **Add more variety to your memojis**: I still have not figured out how to actually use memojies, practically, so...\n9. **Get suggested smart home automations**: I'm sorry... What did you say? I'm not familiar with those words.\n10. **Get to bed on time**: Clarification: \"iOS 14 works with watchOS 7 (or on its own) to help you get to sleep at the right time each night, with reminders and Do Not Disturb options.\" If you were truly _at all_ interested in not being disturbed _or_ getting lots of sleep, you wouldn't have spent $300 on a machine to strap to your wrist who's **primary function** is to disturb you!\n11. **Translate websites in Safari**: Christ... _Really_? How have I not encountered an issue with this before?\n12. **Search inside apps**: **There we go!** The first item on this list that suggests anyone at Apple _actually uses iOS_!\n13. **Get more detailed weather forecasts**: Dark Sky acquision... All this one does is remind me that Apple's self-restraint could breach at any time and essentially the only competent mobile weather app ever devised could die or be molested into irrelevance.\n14. **Use your iPhone as a translator**: Well... Yeah... Anything that convenienctly allows me to reduce dependence on Google, I guess!\n15. **Get more facts from Siri**: ..._lol_  \n    \"Apple says Siri knows more facts than ever before, though it hasn’t offered up any specific examples of something it knows in iOS 14 that it didn’t know in iOS 13—you’ll have to try and test it out yourself. According to Apple, Siri now knows 20 times the number of facts that it did three years ago, and we haven’t been able to catch it out with anything so far.\"\n16. **Get cycling directions in Apple Maps**: No! Cut that out!\n17. **Plan a journey in an electric vehicle**: I'm not joking when I suggest that this fits perfectly into iOS 14's _Anxiety Mode Enchancement_ theme: all this really means is _We've added the new Apple Range Anxiety app_!\n\n[David Blue's Guide to Columbia, Missouri](https:\/\/davidblue.wtf\/columbiaguide) renders surprisingly beautifully on a desktop browser.\n\nYes, there _are_ examples of genuine progress. The Guides feature in Maps (seen above) probably could\/should have been added a long time ago, but at least Apple executed it quite elegantly. I'm could've _sworn_ sharing your ETA has been possible from within Maps since like... iOS 7 or something, but perhaps I was thinking of [Waze](https:\/\/apps.apple.com\/us\/app\/waze-navigation-live-traffic\/id323229106). **Wallpapers for CarPlay** are one of those features that didn’t occur to me to want, but I did\/do. Also - though my personal experience with CarPlay has been limited - I can definitely imagine more layout options (“Horizontal status bar”) will be useful in _fringe_ use cases.\n\nAnd that's it!

I continue to be amazed by how influential the potential of the computing hardware present in my life at any given time can be on my habits. In the two weeks I’ve had [my first moderately powerful desktop computer](https:\/\/www.davidblue.wtf\/hp-envy-desktop\/) in over ten years, I have found myself using new image & video editing software, installing local WordPress stacks, finally experimenting with Git, somehow generating 20 draft posts on [a fresh experimental WordPress site](https:\/\/www.davidblue.wtf\/), and putting my whole back into my new Notion account, including – among others – projects like my “[Keyboard Shortcuts Wiki](https:\/\/www.notion.so\/rotund\/Keyboard-Shortcuts-Wiki-9b4567d5b41447638cd6330aed7c2a1b).” All the while, there has been a pull toward a more deliberate, focused sort of digital existence: reflection on [Kevin McGillivray’s Word of The Year concept](https:\/\/www.kevinmcgillivray.net\/word\/), [digital gardening](https:\/\/tomcritchlow.com\/blogchains\/digital-gardens\/), and a few other like discoveries have culminated in a newfound, unironic use of the term “[Creative Wellness](https:\/\/www.notion.so\/rotund\/Creative-Wellness-b43e3df6f4b94333aa97ea98b67cb760)” to describe a set of ideologies which I believe I should strive for in order to improve my intellectual wellbeing. \n\nIn tandem with the fact that I have [gone back to school](https:\/\/www.davidblue.wtf\/college-return\/), this has all crucially resulted in very little *actual writing*, which may or may not be conclusive evidence toward the classical minimalist technology argument that less capability results in more focus. On that note, remember when [the *Game of Thrones* author appeared on Conan’s show](https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2014\/5\/14\/5716232\/george-r-r-martin-uses-dos-wordstar-to-write) and mentioned that he still writes exclusively using WordStar 4.0? This happening has been vaguely in the back of my mind since I encountered it during the relatively brief, basement apartment-dwelling era in Oregon when I first discovered WinWorldPC and got into running a bunch of DOS VMs, trying out every download from that blessed site which sounded even remotely interesting. Before I go on, let me just include a transcript of the entire anecdote I’m referring to here, because it’s actually much shorter than one is led to believe:\n\n> **Conan**: These novels that that you write are can be over a thousand pages long. They're massive tomes and apparently you write them all on a computer, but unlike most authors, you're not worried about a computer virus. I mean an author who writes a thousand-page book their greatest fear is a virus invades and destroys a chunk of their book you don't worry about that. Why?\n>\n> **Martin**: No I have a secret weapon - I actually have two computers: I have the computer that I browse the internet with and that I get my email on and I do my taxes on and that computer and then I have my writing computer which is a DOS machine not connected to the Internet.\n>\n> **Conan**: A DOS machine. How old is this program?\n>\n> **Martin**: A DOS machine. You remember DOS? I use WordStar 4.0 as my word processing system. \n>\n> **Conan**: Did you make this computer out of wood? Did you carve it? I'm curious why you decided to stick with this old program.\n\n> **Martin**: I actually like it. I mean, it does everything I want a word processing program to do, and it doesn't do anything else. I don't want any help. I hate some of these modern systems where you type a lowercase letter and it becomes a capital. I don't want a capital - if I wanted a capital, I would've typed a capital. I know how to work the shift key. Stop fixing it!\n\n> **Conan**: You yell at computers a lot. What about spellcheck?\n>\n> **Martin**: Oh, I hate spellcheck. Especially when you have the realm of [???], it's [???].\n\nThat’s it! A less than sixty second exchange. I did not remember just how much coverage it received on digital news sites. Embark on a Google search for “[george rr martin wordstar](https:\/\/www.google.com\/search?q=george+rr+martin+wordstar),” and you’ll discover a ridiculously long list of brief stories including the YouTube embed. A book I’ve just recently discovered and begun – which I am extremely excited about – is Professor Matthew G. Kirschenbaum’s [*Track Changes: A Literary History of Word Processing*](https:\/\/www.hup.harvard.edu\/catalog.php?isbn=9780674417076), and its introduction begins by mentioning *The George Thing*, which surely indicates that it is the most significant mention of word processing software in popular culture for at least a decade:\n\n> The clip was posted to YouTube and from there embedded in innumerable tweets, Facebook feeds, and blogs. Some commenters immediately, if indulgently, branded Martin a Luddite, while others opined it was no wonder it was taking him so long to finish the whole story (or less charitably, no wonder that it all seemed so interminable). But what was it about these seemingly obscure details that people found so compelling? Part of it was no doubt the unexpected blend of novelty and nostalgia: Many fans would be old enough to remember WordStar for themselves, and the intricacy of its interface seems somehow in keeping with Martin’s quirky persona, part paternalistic grandfather and part *Doctor Who* character. WordStar thus becomes an accessory to his public image, like the black fisherman’s cap he is frequently photographed wearing. But it is also clearly much more than that. Martin’s passion for the program is unmistakable...\n\nThe book, itself, was also more widely reviewed than one would expect, where it was deemed genuinely unique. I *related* quite hard to the preface’s first few sentences:\n\n> *Track Changes* began, as many books do, with a question: What was the first novel written with a word processor? Being an English professor interested in the history of writing as well as computers, I thought it was the sort of thing I should know, but I didn’t.\n\nDiscovering the volume was a result of a personal determination in the last week to give in to my latent obsession with word processing\/text editing software, which also led to my creating [a Notion table of every word processor I’ve ever heard of](https:\/\/www.notion.so\/rotund\/0f3f754d5a4b46cb99bd3e1c0a2e1159?v=a85e98bc06424b72a3a249a87cb62101). Thanks to my desktop PC acquisition, found myself virtual machining a bit again, though some of the programs I’m particularly interested in trying have inexplicitly disappeared from my personal library and been removed from WinWorldPC, probably due to (mostly absurd) copyright claims. Most versions of WordStar are [still available](https:\/\/winworldpc.com\/product\/wordstar), though, and I’ll confess I still have a desire to learn how to use its cult keyboard shortcuts, [as evangelized by Robert J. Sawyer in an essay](https:\/\/arstechnica.com\/information-technology\/2017\/03\/wordstar-a-writers-word-processor\/) *also* discussed in *Track Changes*, which specifically shits on WordPerfect more explicitly than I remembered. I keep returning to the idea that I should try writing the stuff I normally work on – like this post, for instance – in these software, but file transfer is a bigger and bigger obstacle the older the OS you’re running: VirutalBox’s “[Guest Additions](https:\/\/www.virtualbox.org\/manual\/ch04.html)” – which allow clipboard sharing\/shared folders\/other interoperative network functions – are not compatible with DOS or any Windows editions before 4.0. There are workarounds, but I haven’t found any reasonably within my current abilities.\n\nTruthfully, though, emulating twenty-year-old software seems a bit unnecessary when contrasted with the fact that Markdown, Typora, and Writeas were [supposed to be my saviors](https:\/\/write.as\/community\/chat-with-david-blue) from distracted writing. A compulsion to comment on a [recent note-taking app comparison published in *The Information*](https:\/\/www.theinformation.com\/articles\/tech-execs-are-obsessing-over-note-taking-apps-we-tested-them-out) reminded me that I *still* haven’t written an in-depth review of Typora, which I plan to prioritize in the near future, especially since it may finally be officially releasing, according to [recent activity on Twitter](https:\/\/twitter.com\/Typora\/status\/1289586532353900544). \n\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet tw-align-center\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">some gorgeous themes added to Typora&#39;s theme gallery recently. <a href=\"https:\/\/t.co\/oFXop0W9ZU\">https:\/\/t.co\/oFXop0W9ZU<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/t.co\/mZ3OwAqrv6\">pic.twitter.com\/mZ3OwAqrv6<\/a><\/p>&mdash; David Blue (@NeoYokel) <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/NeoYokel\/status\/1307551063810158594?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">September 20, 2020<\/a><\/blockquote> <script async src=\"https:\/\/platform.twitter.com\/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"><\/script>\n\nAnother result of my reintroduction to academia is that I can now afford a subscription to Adobe Creative Cloud thanks to student discounts. This has been life-changing in a manner which I should probably be a bit ashamed of, but once the desire to *make full use* of my subscription (by trying every single program it licenses) subsides, I really do intend to become proficient with [InDesign](https:\/\/www.davidblue.wtf\/t\/Adobe-Indesign\/) – a learning experience which I will surely at least attempt to thoroughly document, here. \n\n## Digital Gardening\n\nI think it was [Tom Critchlow’s Digital Gardening blogchain](https:\/\/tomcritchlow.com\/blogchains\/digital-gardens\/) that first exposed me to the term and [his static site-generated wiki project](https:\/\/tomcritchlow.com\/wiki\/) that introduced me to the concept of personal wikis, not so long ago, though the desire to organize and\/or archive personally-relevant information through the format has actually been rattling around my head for the better part of a decade. When I discovered that one could install [MediaWiki](https:\/\/www.mediawiki.org\/wiki\/MediaWiki) – the platform Wikipedia, itself is built on – I created the shortlived *Drywall Wiki*, once upon a time. Since I last wrote you, I also purchased the [extratone.wiki](https:\/\/extratone.wiki\/) domain and played around once again with the platform. Typora even offers exports in MediaWiki’s bizarre proprietary text format! For better or worse, though, I don’t see anything becoming of the project for the moment I suppose it feels like somewhat of a risk, investing a lot of time I probably shouldn’t have into documenting all of my Twitter jokes. For the moment, I think my Notion account will have to serve as my personal wiki.\n\nThe most inciteful argument I’ve read among the Digital Gardens discourse revolves around *value* as it is created within our personal online writing spaces. Two of the many infinitely-quotable essays within this space: Mike Caulfield’s “[The Garden and the Stream: A Technopastoral](https:\/\/hapgood.us\/2015\/10\/17\/the-garden-and-the-stream-a-technopastoral\/)” and “[Stock and flow](http:\/\/snarkmarket.com\/2010\/4890)” from *Snarkmarket*. The former references Vannevar Bush’s infamous “[As We May Think](https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/magazine\/archive\/1945\/07\/as-we-may-think\/303881\/)” essay (which I’ve finally gotten around to finishing and its description of a “memex,” which many cite as a disturbingly-apt prediction of the World Wide Web. Caulfield, however, disagrees:\n\n> So most people say this is the original vision of the web. And certainly it was the inspiration of those pioneers of hypertext. But in reality it doesn’t predict the web at all . Not at all. The web works very little like this. It’s weird, because in our minds the web still works like this, but it’s a fiction.\n\nReading back from a lens including this commentary, I immediately understood. The *memex* concept is far more intimate than the web has become (or perhaps ever was – I wouldn’t know.) “Stock and flow” defines creative value in two disparate types of media:\n\n> **Flow** is the feed. It’s the posts and the tweets. It’s the stream of daily and sub-daily updates that reminds people you exist.\n>\n> **Stock** is the durable stuff. It’s the content you produce that’s as interesting in two months (or two years) as it is today. It’s what people discover via search. It’s what spreads slowly but surely, building fans over time.\n\nTo be honest, I personally cannot imagine undertaking the task of explaining this differentiation to *anyone* in my own life, but if the reactionary movement within The Web back to a focus on *valuable* content is, indeed, underway, perhaps such conversations are bound to shortly become more and more natural. For my part, I have attempted setting up an experimental site on Github Pages using Jekyll in the past few days with partial success: as soon as I tried to specify a custom theme, I apparently broke it, at which point I realized that I had homework to do. As much as I hate to admit it, [Kev Quirk’s posts regarding WordPress’ *practical* simplicity over SSGs](https:\/\/kevq.uk\/static-site-generators-revisited\/) earlier this monthrings somewhat true. As things currently stand, WordPress’ permeability throughout The Web is an *advantage* for those who just want to publish something as simply as possible. My counterargument to both Kev and myself: **[Writeas](https:\/\/write.as\/) is a wonderful compromise** in terms of substance and *image* among one’s super e-enabled, Mullenweg-disgusted peers. It’s very much pure Markdown, but it’s far more accessible, cross-platform, than SSGs due to its shear simplicity.\n\nOne component which Digital Gardening would seem to offer others that I have never particularly struggled with is the freedom to write whatever I feel like writing. If anything, I have struggled in the opposite sense, existing in a state *completely unhindered* by consideration of the value my work may or may not offer anyone else. Perhaps the most substantial addition I’m capable of making to the Digital Gardens conversation, then, is best quoted from the first chapter of the advice book I have finally begun writing for young men, *[For God’s Sake, Just Sit Down to Piss](https:\/\/www.davidblue.wtf\/writing\/projects\/piss\/)*:\n\n> If there is one idea of mine you ever engage with – in this book or otherwise – it is best distilled in this single sentence: **you do not \\*actually\\* want to attain a state of true apathy**, trust me. It is extremely unhealthy, miserable, and alienating. I have existed for an excruciatingly long time trapped in a state of being truly unable to care about anything in the face of a great, varying effort to do so. It is very far from the immunity imbued in terms like *carefree* – in reality, it is manifested in extreme depression. It is less *immunity* than it is *distance* from an essential part of life.\n\nIn terms of one’s blogging, I am glad for those who will\/have\/are finding a new freedom of expression, but hold this as a serious caution regarding the *other* extreme. Should you ever approach it, remember that *considering one’s audience* – as academics love to prioritize – really *is* important, eventually. \n\n## Curation\n\nAt this point, I’ve used [a channel in *Extratone*’s Discord](https:\/\/bit.ly\/extratone) as my ongoing reading list for several years essentially without change. Earlier this month, though, I discovered Raindrop – a bookmarking service with public collections that (so fars) feels much more aligned with my own needs than Pocket – and pretty much immediately signed up to begin paying for it and set up a bot to crosspost from [my new Reading List collection](https:\/\/raindrop.io\/collection\/13380406), there to the same Discord channel via [the collection’s RSS feed](https:\/\/raindrop.io\/collection\/13380406\/feed). Raindrop’s browser extension – along with Notion’s, come to mention it – is *actually usable* in day-to-day browsing. As much as I love [Reading.am](https:\/\/www.reading.am\/davidblue), the prospect of its longevity worries me considering the most recent post in its [development blog](https:\/\/writing.reading.am\/) dates to 2016. Writing a dedicated “[Little Review](https:\/\/www.davidblue.wtf\/c\/software\/little\/)” of Raindrop is on my (ever-lengthening) todo list, but at the moment, I would especially emphasize my [Digital Magazine Collection](https:\/\/raindrop.io\/collection\/13419360), which is the result of thousands of hours of web exploration and genuinely worth significant value for most anyone, I think.\n\n<blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-permalink=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/p\/CFDYTmuh-kg\/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"12\" style=\" background:#FFF;

In terms of a dedicated discussion of Notion’s interworkings and culture, I think I have quite a bit more exploring to experience before I’m sufficiently qualified, though my notes are already quite extensive (and [publicly accessible](https:\/\/www.notion.so\/rotund\/Little-Review-Notes-228e10a1d3fe453fac69c9244a24ee3a), thanks to… Notion!) In general, I continue to be astounded by the amount of tools\/services\/applications I *have not yet* heard of, despite how long I have labored to become an authority on Writing Tools.\n\n![Too Many Fonts! - WordPerfect](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/mPEMBma.png)\n\n## Workflow\n\nIn my endeavor to more intentionally design my workspace – to actually dedicate a space for working, originally – I originally very much intended to set up dual displays for my desktop, but the desk I settled for (an old family piece from the early 1900s?) does *not* have enough surface area to position two displays, regardless of how thin they’ve become since I last had one. Combined with a limited budget and a concern that two displays might actually result in *further* distraction instead of less, I instead went for a single, 27” LED affair. I’ve also been making full use of [Windows 10’s desktop switching feature](https:\/\/www.cnet.com\/how-to\/how-to-use-multiple-desktops-in-windows-10\/) and have found it surprisingly easy to make a habit, especially thanks to the **Ctrl+Win+Lateral Arrow Keys** keyboard shortcuts.\n\n![Hildur Keyboard Shortcuts](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/lEx7zen.png)\n\nOn the subject of keyboard shortcuts, I’ve by now worked out a personally-optimized remap (thanks to the keyboard manager tool included with [PowerToys](https:\/\/github.com\/microsoft\/PowerToys), about which I have *far too much* to say in some future post.) I had [a conversation with a few Mastodon friends](https:\/\/mastodon.social\/web\/statuses\/104843391967830863) two weeks ago convincing me that my methodology of forcing myself to learn shortcuts by integrating a cheat sheet into my desktop backgrounds may actually be an *original idea* and useful to other users.\n\nIn terms of writing spaces, I have actually been composing the less serious stuff I’ve been writing within WordPress’ Gutenberg editor, which is *not* an admission I would’ve expected to be making, just a year ago. A dedicated post about this, too, is *fucking coming*, but suffice it to say that with a fairly-substantial PC and a better hosting provider (DreamHost over GoDaddy, in this case,) composition has become *far far* smoother – improving enough to make it a viable space within which to pound away original stuff for the first time. Writing essays for academia has encouraged my return to Microsoft Word, once again, on which I’ll blame the fact that I am currently composing this very bit in The Old Bitch. A desire to once again hack together a set of personalized Word templates has led to the birth of two such files which I am proud enough to [share on my Notion drive](https:\/\/www.notion.so\/rotund\/Configuration-2efccc31e19540c294b2bc5b7cfa4863). Eventually, I would also like to take the time to completely redesign the “Ribbon” in Word – something which I’ve literally never seen anyone else do. (I spent a substantial amount of time trying to find a library for MS Office customization files, to no avail, though you can find my own customization file as it stands on the same Notion page linked just now. Let me know if you’re able to successfully import it.)\n\n![Woke Word](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/gsVHo1z.png)\n\nA confession of vanity: I suspect the only reason I haven’t yet stopped composing within WordPress is that I figured out how to change the typeface to Adobe Caslon (across both the editor and the front-facing site, naturally,) thanks to my newfound access to Adobe Typekit. Yes, apparently I really *am* that shallow. For those Office 365 users among you, I *highly* suggest you look up [how to enable the Classic Office sound theme](https:\/\/www.makeuseof.com\/tag\/turn-off-annoying-sounds-microsoft-office-2016\/). Unlike *Make Use Of*, I find them both adorable and genuinely useful as auditory feedback. You may also be interested in my discovery of [some fairly-Woke additions](https:\/\/docs.microsoft.com\/en-us\/style-guide\/bias-free-communication) to Word’s autocorrect options and the [subsequent bitchy controversy](https:\/\/www.foxnews.com\/tech\/microsoft-ai-word-politically-correct) their introduction spawned.\n\n![Software History Society Banner](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/YHk2EhE.png)\n\n## The Read-It Website\n\nIf you know me at all, the following admission probably seems unbelievable: I have been *using Reddit*. I created a [new subreddit for *Extratone*](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/extratown\/) – which I do not necessarily expect to be populated any time soon – and [r\/SoftwareHistory](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/softwarehistory) after discovering that it didn’t yet exist, which I *definitely* do not expect you to populate, but would be delighted if you did. As with seemingly everything else I’ve covered, I *also* intend to write about how Reddit’s recent feature additions and redesign may *actually* make it a redeemable space on The Web, which should prove interesting. Clearly, I have become more than willing to accept the moniker of *Software Historian* whenever\/if ever my authority achieves the appropriate volume to deserve to be christened so.\n\nObviously, none of the developments I’ve shared in this post indicate any improvement in my productive output, but I hope to learn soon how to settle into a fairly-consistent (and hopefully much more original) writing process.\n\n<!--comment-->\n\n#software #meta","views":1370,"updated":"2023-06-05T16:14:33Z","tags":["FFFFFF","F4F4F4","3897f0","f4f4f4","c9c8cd","software","meta","FFF"],"type":null,"title":"Indulging Once More in Digital Excess","slug":"digital-excess","appearance":"norm","language":"en","rtl":false,"created":"2020-09-24T22:31:23Z","images":["https:\/\/i.snap.as\/f1fGg1B.png","https:\/\/i.snap.as\/mPEMBma.png","https:\/\/i.snap.as\/lEx7zen.png","https:\/\/i.snap.as\/gsVHo1z.png","https:\/\/i.snap.as\/YHk2EhE.png"],"collection":{"public":false,"alias":"bilge","total_posts":0,"title":"The Psalms","verification_link":"","description":"A <a href=\"https:\/\/davidblue.wtf\/db.vcf\">narcoleptic yokel<\/a> on software and culture.","style_sheet":"","views":177027,"monetization_pointer":""},"paid":false},{"id":"9s9z5cvwbzmv0hb1","body":"Created: Oct 13, 2020 2:30 PM\nLast Edited: Oct 14, 2020 2:27 PM\nTags: Chronicle\nTimestamp: Oct 13, 2020 2:30 PM\n\n![](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/3nnzV4e7.png)\n\nMy very first external comment in Notion!\n\nI'm still not entirely sure how to organize these.

Not that it's particularly supportive of that argument, but Mark Fuck, himself, recently [said in court](https:\/\/www.businessinsider.com\/mark-zuckerberg-mentions-the-social-network-during-testimony-2018-4), essentially, that he didn't know what the movie was about. I'm not particularly sure, either. I suppose the dramatic film industry has no particular obligation to be critical of *the times*, but *documentaries* certainly should, in my estimation, and *The Social Dilemma* could've done better, in that regard.\n\nFirst, the **actively misleading**: As thoroughly as I enjoyed Peter Campbell's casting as the master-manipulating triplets behind the dramatized young man's screen, the film's depiction of this very human invasion of privacy is *blatantly false* imagery. The Privacy Problem is *not* that Facebook or Google employees are directly and actively viewing and manipulating your use of their services in real time. In fact, it is *ridiculously* unlikely that human eyes will ever see your individualized information. One could go so far as to describe the whole film as \"ridiculous,\" as did one of my favs, [Casey Newton](https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/interface\/2020\/9\/16\/21437942\/social-dilemma-netflix-review-orlowski-sarah-zhang-memo-facebook-buzzfeed):\n\n> The dramatized segments include a fictional trio of sociopaths working inside an unnamed social network to design bespoke push notifications to distract their users. They show an anguished family struggling to get the children to put their phones away during dinner. And the ominous piano score that pervades every scene, rather than ratcheting up the tension, gives it all the feeling of camp.\n\n[*The Verge*'s official review of the film](https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2020\/9\/4\/21419993\/the-social-dilemma-jeff-orlowski-netflix-movie-review-social-media-algorithms) - written by Adi Robinson and as cited by Casey - is an important read, as well. Robinson makes use of some very intelligent language and cites some very interesting bits (including a Wikipedia article about a series of Hogarth paintings?) for *The Verge*'s audience, who already knew all of this. What I hoped to do by writing about this at all was speak to those distinctly *separate* tech media - grandmothers, retirees, etc. - who are both directly affected by the subjects covered by *The Social Dilemma* and particularly susceptible to its delusions about \"privacy\" - a term which I would argue is not particularly relevant to the conversation. Personally, I define my privacy in a way that is not violated by the simple **collection** of \"my data,\" regardless of how detailed said collection may or may not be, but would be by individual **examination** with human eyes, which - while possible - is extremely unlikely if for no other reason than a lack of business incentive. While Google may have access to the data it would need to determine whether I am currently showering or not, there is absolutely zero monetary gain to be had in one of its employees (or outsourced contractors) knowing this. \n\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet tw-align-center\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">you don&#39;t have to care about reforming privacy, intellectual property, or any of the other issues an alternative addresses - you need only to want a better and\/or different experience.<\/p>&mdash; David Blue (@NeoYokel) <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/NeoYokel\/status\/1283173322822488064?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">July 14, 2020<\/a><\/blockquote> <script async src=\"https:\/\/platform.twitter.com\/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"><\/script>\n\nNow, on to the **notably missing**: Perhaps most important to note before I go on is that the film was produced by - and directly promotes on several occasions - one particular organization, called the [*Center for Humane Technology*](https:\/\/www.humanetech.com\/), which notably has a .com rather than a .org domain... hm. Immediately after watching the film, I complied with its direction to its website, where I was specifically looking for \"solutions\" to the issues it presented. Aside from Wikipedia (sortof,) it neglected to mention the abundance of alternative organizations and projects who've been building against the adtech-funded web for ages - some for decades. Unfortunately, neither the organization's website nor the film's webpage list any of these alternatives, whatsoever, which personally leads me to believe **the whole thing is bullshit**, for lack of a better term.\n\n![The Social Dilemma Newsletter Prompt](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/6k9MzeE.png)\n\nThe film essentially argues for a single choice: using social media and other adtech-sustained services, or *not* using them. What I'm here to tell you: **you have a choice of services**. For every single individual service criticized in the film, I guarantee there exists at least a handful of alternatives across a spectrum of sin. If you've followed my work for any length of time (you probably shouldn't still be reading,) you know I've advocated exhaustively for [Mastodon](https:\/\/joinmastodon.org\/) - the open web, decentralized social network outpacing Twitter in every single way. Two years ago, I spent [an entire summer](https:\/\/bilge.world\/bandcamp-streaming-music) arguing that Bandcamp is the only music streaming service who's business model benefits both platform and artist. I'm still finishing up [a massive essay that discusses alternatives to Facebook](https:\/\/www.notion.so\/rotund\/David-Blue-vs-Big-Blue-9d82a679c93a41d78c6736e8a61e30e0), which has been an exhausting but educational journey, as you can probably imagine, namely that leaving a platform as all-consuming as Facebook for an open-source and\/or federated alternative requires a certain amount of bravery. Essentially, the evidence suggests that the *alternatives* discussion is a particularly important one to me, as is finding a way to evangelize it that isn't immediately off-putting to \"the average person.\"\n\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"265\" src=\"https:\/\/clyp.it\/oxpup2vm\/widget\" frameborder=\"0\"><\/iframe>\n\nPoke around the film's official website a bit and you'll discover a variety of heavily-branded \"resources\" for \"taking action,\" all awash with a certain irony, including [a fucking Bingo game](https:\/\/drive.google.com\/file\/d\/1juAZCcmRpNNjXajXnm0KOS-9fFUhPI3q\/view) (hosted on Google Drive, no less,) which the site *actually* suggests you post on your Instagram story! Also under the \"Take Action\" vertical are links to Moment CEO Tim Kendall's [tips for reducing your screen time](https:\/\/www.thesocialdilemma.com\/reclaim-your-screen-time\/), the \"[Data Detox Kit](https:\/\/datadetoxkit.org\/en\/home\/),\" which advocates for Firefox as the private browsing solution (among an indigestibly huge link tree,) a \"Join Now\" button, and - most ironic of all - a link to download the \"[Ad Observer plugin](https:\/\/adobserver.org\/),\" in order to \"share with researchers the ads you see on social media as they work to expose micro-targeting techniques & hold political advertisers accountable.\" In other words, the very same data collection the film condemns, albeit for the \"Online Political Transparency Project\" instead of the greater adtech monstrosity. \n\n![The Social Dilemma Bingo](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/gf22b9R.png)\n\nNo, it's not a scam. Using *The Markup*'s shiny new [Blacklight tool](https:\/\/themarkup.org\/blacklight), I found thesocialdilemma.com to be entirely free of any malicious tracking aside from the inevitable accompaniment to their Google Drive embeds. (Here's [the report in full](https:\/\/s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com\/secure.notion-static.com\/893e4684-462b-4548-92ad-b85f240d0e85\/report.html?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=AKIAT73L2G45O3KS52Y5%2F20201001%2Fus-west-2%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20201001T204417Z&X-Amz-Expires=86400&X-Amz-Signature=98001ad78557d11b12dda1347cb193c252f54a81b00547970717080c06bf04eb&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&response-content-disposition=filename%20%3D%22report.html%22).) All at once, we can be virtually certain there is no *malice* in this particular destination, at least, which leaves... incompetence? I'm afraid so. It is not revolutionary to suppose that the people who conceived of these ruthlessly effective systems of adtech and figure out how to implement them in the real world - regardless of what they believe now, or then - that these folks should not be our first call when we're searching for \"solutions.\" You know this, they know it, and they *explicitly acknowledged it* at least twice in the film, itself, and yet the fact of it remains.\n\nWould you care to guess what [Chapter 1](https:\/\/datadetoxkit.org\/en\/privacy\/essentials\/#step-1) of the [*Digital Detox Kit*](https:\/\/datadetoxkit.org\/) is about? I can't imagine you'd be correct... Under the heading \"CONTROL YOUR SMARTPHONE DATA,\" step 1 is literally just *renaming your phone*:\n\n> At some point, you may have “named” your phone for *Wi-Fi, Bluetooth* or both – or maybe the name was automatically generated during setup.\n>\n> This means that *“Alex Chung’s Phone”* is what’s visible to the Wi-Fi network owner and, if your Bluetooth is turned on, to everyone in the area who has their Bluetooth on as well.\n>\n> You wouldn't announce your name as you enter a café, restaurant, or airport, so neither should your phone.\n\nNow, I've always considered the ability to change a computer's name an immense privilege. My first \"real\" computer's name was Clementine, then there was Bertha, two Sophies (probably my favorite traditionally female name, so I excuse myself,) Silas, Linus, Uel, Jehoshaphat, Temba, Knot, and now Hildur. My iPhone 8 Plus' name is Gravel. However, I realize that most users could care less, and I think that's completely rational. Technically, suggesting you change your phone's common name to that of \"your favorite television character\" ([Hildur Odegard](https:\/\/fortitude.fandom.com\/wiki\/Hildur_Odegard) is my favorite character in *Fortitude*, so...) is *not* bad advice, even within its own privacy-centered argument, it's just that it's *ridiculously* low priority (or should be) compared with doing just about anything else along this vein. A conundrum is presented: I cannot imagine these people sitting down and seriously jotting down \"change device name\" as step 1 in their strategy, but I also cannot fathom an incentive for them to expend such effort facetiously or maliciously. Again, incompetence\/ignorance is the only remaining explanation.\n\n![Firefox for iOS Notification](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/sEa9ojU.jpeg)\n*A notification I received while literally typing this out.*\n\nI have to backtrack, now, and confess that I *did* find an \"[Alternative Apps Centre](https:\/\/datadetoxkit.org\/en\/alternative-app-centre\/)\" within the Data Detox Kit, which contains some genuinely smart recommendations like ProtonMail, Riot, Signal, and DuckDuckGo surrounding a bunch of privacy-enhancing browser extensions. However, the \"detox\" seems to have been lost at some point along the way. No amount of privacy (yes, I do think it's hilarious that I can freely refer to \"privacy\" as a commodity with a positive quantity) can detoxify one' social media addiction. The savvy reader notes the \"Supported by Mozilla Firefox\" badges all over the website and asks me \"well, what did you expect?\" My answer: something \"more\" than promotion, I suppose.\n\nI suspect this is another case of *don't go to those who created the problem for the solution*. *More privacy* is a more tangible vector upon which to \"innovate\" than simply *putting down the fucking phone*, but the interviewees in the film at least touched upon a very important insight in that regard: **turn off all your notifications**. I genuinely believe turning off *all* notifications is a good way to proceed, especially if this film (or anything else, for that matter) has made you feel uncomfortable about your relationship with your phone. I realized that I'd somehow allowed YouTube to clutter my notifications unconsciously for *years*, which is disturbing. In general, the apps who's notifications I'd probably value the most (Bandcamp!) are the ones who use the feature the least\/the most subtly.\n\nLeaving your phone in a different room while you sleep is a good idea, though it seems a bit excessive when you could just **turn it off**, instead. (Displaced from your bed or stone dead, your chances of making use of your handset in an emergency are about the same, I'd wager.) I suspect it's long overdue for a reboot, anyway. As far as \"**Email Addiction**\" goes, I suggest you first take an afternoon to go through your inbox and make use of GDPR's greatest gift: the single-click opt-out, most often found in very small text in a given email's footer. If you're *really* serious, unsubscribe from even the newsletters you *do* read and make yourself resubscribe to them. Make use of your preferred email platform's archives feature - or don't - but clear everything from your inbox itself. Mark it all as read. Then, you'll be ready to seek out other *Email Wellness* methodologies like the recently-trendy *Inbox Zero*.\n\nIf quitting social media cold turkey is not viable in your personal or professional life, **a set daily time** to check your notifications is a very good start. Yes, it's okay to announce on Facebook that you're taking a break from Facebook. There *is* a very good reason: accountability, to both yourself and your friends. If you are interested in the alternatives I mentioned before, genuinely **contact me literally any time**. My personal phone number is **(573) 823-4380**. I would be elated to discuss some of the services I've discovered with you. \n\nMy own advice on \"privacy:\" don't worry about installing browser extensions, or using a different browser for that matter. Aside from a password manager, there is no need to download or install any additional software to protect your information. All the \"privacy tools\" you need are already present on your device, and they mostly consist of geolocation settings. If you're an iOS user, you've already been confronted with them in the past few months. If you are still genuinely bothered by automated data collection unseen by human eyes, your only next step - if we're really honest with ourselves - is figuring out how you're going to go without the internet. Untracked browsing is no longer a realistic option.\n\n#software #film","views":1698,"updated":"2022-04-04T07:55:51Z","tags":["software","film"],"type":null,"title":"The Social Dilemma's Dilemma","slug":"the-social-dilemma","appearance":"norm","language":"en","rtl":false,"created":"2020-10-19T20:10:47Z","images":["https:\/\/i.snap.as\/sEa9ojU.jpeg","https:\/\/i.snap.as\/5X1uFAi.jpg","https:\/\/i.snap.as\/6k9MzeE.png","https:\/\/i.snap.as\/gf22b9R.png"],"collection":{"public":false,"alias":"bilge","total_posts":0,"title":"The Psalms","verification_link":"","description":"A <a href=\"https:\/\/davidblue.wtf\/db.vcf\">narcoleptic yokel<\/a> on software and culture.","style_sheet":"","views":177027,"monetization_pointer":""},"paid":false},{"id":"w7y0lhp2rpoqixpw","body":"![Digital Leaves](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/SFHmuSlu.png)\n\n## Purposing a disciplined effort to reflect on those tech products which have remained too fair and\/or too good to catch the attention of the alarmists in us, recently.\n\n<!--more-->\n\n<audio controls>\n  <source src=\"https:\/\/github.com\/extratone\/bilge\/raw\/main\/audio\/TTS\/SoftwareThanksgiving.m4a\">\n<\/audio>\n\nI've never been a big fan of holidays, nor do I think Thanksgiving should be a federal one, given its shitty, undebatably imperialist origins, but these opinions are entirely inconsequential. Regardless of how I feel, Thanksgiving will remain as pervasive as ever in the spaces around me, so I thought I'd change things up this year and *actually participate* in a substantial way. I did my best to travel back to a vastly less complicated self, letting all of the crud that's accumulated atop my love of computers in the past twenty years: wokeness, adtech, Obama wearing VR glasses, etc... When I thought the Native Americans were *glad*  to see white people because they gave them guns and horses and assumed people made things because good ideas were the apex of currency. When I was able to respond to new software discoveries by screwing around aimlessly without wondering if they'd been stolen entirely from a handful of talented developers lacking in the resources and know how required to protect their ideas in the face of Microsoft's ruthless *Embrace, Extend, Extinguish* crusade. \n\nForgive yourself for a moment and return there with me. Or perhaps somewhere else, if you need - wherever and whenever you last remember feeling genuinely enthralled with *The Future of Computers*. (Perhaps it was yesterday! If so, Gourd bless you. Never change.) Let's take ourselves back to kindergarten, before we knew anything about the rapid cyclical consolidation and monopolization within the technology industry that had already established itself as a trend, by then, when all we knew of the software we interacted with was contained within our most visceral reactions: *I like Ask Jeeves because I like red and I like Jeeves.* I vaguely remember when Google (the search engine) first broached the general awareness of my elementary school's computer lab. I'm fairly sure I even remember the sort of feelings that were elicited the first time I actually set eyes on the Google.com homepage: it looked so modern, then, compared to the rest of the web. (After two decades, it currently looks like shit.) Upon the first first query, it was immediately clear that Google was superior to any of the other search engines we'd been using.\n\nThis sort of encounter - with a service that significantly alters one's perception of a given set of tasks - is precious in our lives as users.\n\nA few examples from my own using life which come to mind: \n\n- The first time I witnessed a Skype call.\n- Downloading and using the beta Evernote client on the school machines in Junior High. \n- The first album I uploaded on Bandcamp. \n- Discord's first public release.\n- The \"moment\" I first put a name to Markdown. (I'd been using bits of the syntax for years before I actually read the word.)\n- And most recently, exploring Notion as personal catch-all documentation software. \n\nThe atmosphere of elation about the future on which I so often lament has been replaced by wariness for most of us - from Californian software developers to tractor-hacking farmers. Now, the conversation is saturated with CEO appearances before legal committees, corporate memo leaks, and somber interviews. Of course, I have unquestionably contributed *more* than my share. In fact, I wish I could be twice as critical in twice the written volume, and [I believe](https:\/\/twitter.com\/NeoYokel\/status\/1329078973691695117) the tech media industry to be far too culturally-embedded within Silicon Valley to be nearly critical enough. For this holiday, though, I think a respite from the negative is worthwhile and essential. I know it is for *my* personal sanity, at least.\n\n<iframe src=\"https:\/\/docs.google.com\/forms\/d\/e\/1FAIpQLSfPdoP8oKIG6UhpK515D4x6khPNJqJlHPYAYflwKSpuV_sUDw\/viewform?embedded=true\" width=\"285\" height=\"600\" frameborder=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\">Loading…<\/iframe>\n\nA week ago, I shared [this Google Form](https:\/\/bit.ly\/softthank) and asked you to reflect with me on the \"really great\" software\/services *you* have encountered in your using life built by \"technology companies who's business ethics align toward the benefit of us users and who's products are well-priced (or free!)\" As of the time of this writing, nearly 80 responses have been recorded on the form, itself, and several more via [comments on *Hacker News*](https:\/\/news.ycombinator.com\/item?id=25177582). I deeply appreciate your participation! They're far from predictable, too - I've ended up learning a lot. The very first submission was for [Logos Bible Software](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Logos_Bible_Software), which has [quite a fascinating history](https:\/\/blogs.bible.org\/bible-software-history-101\/). I feel like those less-secular of us go unexposed to theological software without participants such as the human who submitted this one (thank you, human!,) and end up missing out on an entire segment of software development. Having studied The Good Book in a very much analog fashion through Lutheran school, I wonder in retrospect how software solutions could've changed the experience.\n\nI have never received this volume of feedback in my prompts before, nor have I ever really seen a reason to close any of them to responses, so I'm going to take a blind shot at the dartboard and plan to close the form on **New Year's Day, 2021**. Until then, please feel free to respond in any way you'd like and\/or view all the live answers in this [**very bad spreadsheet**](https:\/\/bit.ly\/thanksheet) full of these very *good* responses. (My apologies - I have absolutely no idea how to use Google Sheets.)\n\n![Software Thanksgiving Cloud](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/bj3zAfNm.png)\n\n---\n\n## ⓣⓗⓐⓝⓚⓢ\n\nI originally intended to go into relatively extensive detail for each of the entities on my own Most Thankful For list, but I do have to *actually stop somewhere*, so the commentary on these isn't remarkably insightful or educational. It *is* genuine, though, which is worth something, I hope.\n\n### 1. [Bandcamp](https:\/\/bandcamp.com\/)\n\nYes, I have tirelessly promoted [my essay about Bandcamp's holiness](https:\/\/bilge.world\/bandcamp-streaming-music) for years now, but I have done so with good reason: here is a for-profit technology company which is building a one-of-a-kind product that invests directly in independent artists. I spent a whole summer scouring The Web looking for *a single misstep* or controversy and found absolutely none.\n\n> Over the course of this super link-laden journey, we’d consider the alarmingly hypocritical possibility that it’s been overlooked by mainstream conversations only because it has so long operated in the precise manner we claim is so hopelessly absent from its neighbors in its deliberate, principled, and innovative journey towards a transparent, progressive vision.\n\n### 2. [OBS](https:\/\/obsproject.com\/)\n\nBefore OBS (Open Broadcaster Software,) streaming video was an absolute mess that usually involved paying for or pirating some proprietary software. Remember Ustream? Good God... \n\n<iframe width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/EPZXkvl8cT0?controls=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe>\n\nOBS is the streaming video equivalent of Audacity and GIMP: an extremely powerful, infinitely-malleable set of tools that allow one to take full advantage of their hardware to capture and\/or stream video and audio. \n\n![Typora - Gitbooks Slate Theme](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/uWDyI56s.png)\n\n### 3. [Typora](https:\/\/typora.io\/)\n\nThere's a file entitled \"[My Darling, Typora](https:\/\/github.com\/extratone\/bilge\/blob\/main\/Drafts\/My%20Darling%2C%20Typora.md)\" sitting in my [essay drafts folder](https:\/\/github.com\/extratone\/bilge\/tree\/main\/Drafts), currently, which describes this text editor as \"the perfect writing software.\" (See its [notes page on Notion](https:\/\/www.notion.so\/rotund\/My-Darling-Typora-b20ac14f9d7e4b20b9c823b0d8292c8f) for more.) \n\nFrom another recommendation I wrote:\n\n> Typora is an infinitely-customizable markdown editor spanning all platforms that's managed to become my primary word processor (and I'm someone who demands *a lot* from word processors.) It's immensely powerful in all the important ways - my use over the past two years has stress tested it with both enormous (100,000+ words) and extremely complicated (100+ images and embeds) documents. It's able to export even these chunkos to any format you can imagine instantaneously and never crashes.\n\nFrom a comment I made on [*The Information*'s notetaking software comparison](https:\/\/www.theinformation.com\/articles\/tech-execs-are-obsessing-over-note-taking-apps-we-tested-them-out):\n\n> Typora is a Markdown editor with left sidebar file sorting, very much like Bear (several available themes can make it look actually identical, in fact,) but without its native iCloud-based file syncing. It is cross-platform, open-source, and definitely more powerful, though.\n\nThe Typora theming community has been especially on-point, as of late. In the screenshot embedded above, it's wearing the Slate variation of [H16nning's Gitbook theme](https:\/\/theme.typora.io\/theme\/Gitbook\/), which is by far the most beautiful configuration I've yet to see the editor in.\n\n### 4. [GIMP](https:\/\/www.gimp.org\/)\n\nThe GNU Image Manipulation Program - which just celebrated its [*25th* anniversary](https:\/\/www.gimp.org\/news\/2020\/11\/21\/25-years-of-gimp\/) last week - is one of the most powerful tools in its space and perhaps *the* number one exemplary example of open source software to cite when explaining the concept for the first time. I have used it my entire creative life for all manner of tasks and evangelized it plenty, but it wasn't until I [returned to college](https:\/\/www.davidblue.wtf\/college-return\/) this Fall and took advantage of Adobe's student discounts that I had an opportunity to thoroughly explore its proprietary nemesis, Photoshop. \n\n<iframe width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/CezNvZ-TQlY?controls=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe>\n\nWhat I found was indeed a very powerful piece of software, albeit as arrogant as ever in its stubborn commitment to the original keyboard shortcuts set by default and other legacy artifacts, though not one I would compare to GIMP, necessarily. This shouldn't be breaking news: as far as I know, there are billions of posts comparing the two going back to [the beginning of the written word](https:\/\/www.wired.com\/1998\/03\/a-thrifty-photoshop-built-for-the-web\/). My personal conclusion: **I can accomplish much more, much faster with GIMP** in every single one of my own use cases. \n\n### 5. [Audacity](https:\/\/www.audacityteam.org\/)\n\nI was browsing some FOSS-related article aggregation page a few weeks ago when a post caught my eye: \"[Audacity exceeds 100 million downloads](https:\/\/blog.fosshub.com\/audacity-exceeds-100-million-downloads\/).\" In reflection, I realized in that moment that perhaps no other single piece of software has been so thoroughly present in my \"workflows\" across all sorts of projects through the years, largely because of its God-sent [Truncate Silence feature](https:\/\/manual.audacityteam.org\/man\/truncate_silence.html), which I have used to remove silence from audio files for as long as I've been working within the medium, basically. Every podcast episode I have ever published has passed through Audacity for this reason and others, as have voiceovers, high school punk band demo tapes, personal voice notes, and more.\n\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet tw-align-center\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">the world would actually be perfect if audacity&#39;s truncate silence feature could be autotied to video timecodes.<\/p>&mdash; David Blue (@NeoYokel) <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/NeoYokel\/status\/766786796898357248?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">August 19, 2016<\/a><\/blockquote> <script async src=\"https:\/\/platform.twitter.com\/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"><\/script>\n\nUntil OBS came along, Audacity was where all recorded audio started for myself and my creative friends. It was Audacity that captured (and caused, technically) the [death of my friend's soundcard in audio form](https:\/\/clyp.it\/ycvt1wij) during the recording process for [*Hamura*](https:\/\/ihadtopee.bandcamp.com\/album\/hamura), the first Drywall album, back in October of 2011.\n\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"auto\" src=\"https:\/\/clyp.it\/ycvt1wij\/widget\" frameborder=\"0\"><\/iframe>\n\nFucking around in Audacity through the years has led to some halfway creative results on my part, including [\"SLOWED 'N' THROWED\" Hilary Duff tracks](https:\/\/soundcloud.com\/digivoid\/hilary-duff-with-love-slowed-n-throwed) and [legacy Windows sounds remixes](https:\/\/soundcloud.com\/chordoslut\/windows-operatic). I still use it for every episode of [*End User*](https:\/\/anchor.fm\/davidblue) and have recently created a macro for remastering [*Drycast*](https:\/\/anchor.fm\/drycast) episodes. (A big feat for me and reflective of Audacity's ingenuity.) As far as I know, there are *zero* competitors, proprietary or not, which can replicate Audacity's particular usefulness as an audio utility.\n\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" allow=\"autoplay\" src=\"https:\/\/w.soundcloud.com\/player\/?url=https%3A\/\/api.soundcloud.com\/tracks\/516674979&color=%2300006b&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&show_teaser=true\"><\/iframe>\n\n![NeoCities Interactions](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/10geW13j.png)\n\n### 6. [NeoCities](https:\/\/neocities.org\/)\n\nShortly after I discovered NeoCities last Spring, I signed up to be a [Supporter](https:\/\/neocities.org\/supporter) for $5\/month, not necessarily for the additional storage or bandwidth, but because the project immediately sounded like one I was personally obligated to uplift. Parimal Satyal's essay \"[Rediscovering the Small Web](https:\/\/neustadt.fr\/essays\/the-small-web\/),\" along with the design of the website which delivered it, inspired me to make another attempt at building an HTML site by hand. So far, [davidblue.xyz](https:\/\/davidblue.xyz\/) obviously borrows *heavily* from his CSS, but looking at the code itself was vastly more pleasant than one would expect. Recently, during the course of writing an [academic research essay](https:\/\/github.com\/extratone\/bigblue), I found myself listening to [interviews with its founder, Kyle Drake](https:\/\/www.softwaresessions.com\/episodes\/bringing-geocities-back-with-kyle-drake\/) and reading [articles from its debut in 2013](https:\/\/www.wired.com\/2013\/07\/neocities\/), which prompted me to take even further advantage of my account.\n\n![The Drywall Website](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/UhS9a89b.png)\n\nLast week, I moved my inactive automotive blog ([dieselgoth.com](https:\/\/dieselgoth.com)) from a Writeas blog to a purely-HTML [NeoCities website](https:\/\/neocities.org\/site\/dieselgoth) with disturbingly little friction. (I challenge you to spot any differences.) After discovering a backup of the original Drywall Website deep within my old files, NeoCities was the only reasonable host on which to [archive it](https:\/\/iowa.neocities.org\/). After I'd finished uploading, I fell down what the youth call a \"rabbit hole\" of discovery, mesmerized by what I found on page after page of [NeoCities' site browser](https:\/\/neocities.org\/browse). I did my best to save the best finds by [following them](https:\/\/neocities.org\/site\/davidblue\/follows) within the sites dashboard and have since set up a [*Best of NeoCities* GitHub repository](https:\/\/github.com\/extratone\/neocollect) with my absolute favorites among them archived thanks to [wget](https:\/\/www.gnu.org\/software\/wget\/). \n\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet tw-align-center\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">LOOK AT THIS GORGEOUS WEBSITE! <a href=\"https:\/\/t.co\/nahoRCEkeE\">https:\/\/t.co\/nahoRCEkeE<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/t.co\/mzEfhGygWz\">pic.twitter.com\/mzEfhGygWz<\/a><\/p>&mdash; David Blue (@NeoYokel) <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/NeoYokel\/status\/1328337497416458247?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">November 16, 2020<\/a><\/blockquote> <script async src=\"https:\/\/platform.twitter.com\/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"><\/script>\n\nTrust me when I tell you that **some of the best web design, *ever* can be found on NeoCities**.

For premium users, “badges” will “crown listeners with various titles based on the ways they listened.”\n\n> For example, if a number of your playlists gained significant new followers, you’ll be a *Tastemaker.* If you listened to a song before it was cool (aka hit 50,000 streams), you’ll get the *Pioneer* badge. And based on the number of songs you added to playlists this year, you just might become a *Collector*.\n\nTheir use of the term *Tastemaker* is particularly interesting. “Tastemaking\" - a function once relegated to magazines - has taken a concerning bent in the Algorithmic Age. Very much contemporary terms like “[filter bubble](https:\/\/megaphone.link\/VMP4291212808)” and “[echo chamber](https:\/\/www.culturedmag.com\/shouts-echo-chamber\/)” – applied more and more often to social platforms like Facebook and Twitter, now – can also be associated with music streaming services like Spotify, who’s “playlistification” of content has had a number of alarming effects on American culture.\n\n![Premium Badges - Spotify](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/jKs57Tfw.png)\n\nIn 2018, *The Baffler*’s Liz Pelly explored Spotify playlists’ gender bias in “[Discover Weekly](https:\/\/thebaffler.com\/latest\/discover-weakly-pelly):”\n\n> On Today’s Top Hits, I found that over the course of one month, 64.5 percent of the tracks were by men as the lead artist, with 20 percent by women and 15.5 percent relying on collaborations between men and women artists. When all features were taken into consideration, I found that 85.5 percent of tracks included men artists, while only 45.5 percent included women. This was one of the highest percentages of women artists out of all the playlists I examined.\n\nShe also quotes a LinkedIn post by “Jerry Daykin, the Head of Media Partnerships at Diageo,” in which he observes, “The most popular tracks on Spotify get featured in more playlists and become even more popular as a result.” In January of the same year, the online music magazine *Pitchfork* published an op-ed by musician Damon Krukowski entitled “[How to Be a Responsible Music Fan in the Age of Streaming](https:\/\/pitchfork.com\/features\/oped\/how-to-be-a-responsible-music-fan-in-the-age-of-streaming\/),” which provided concrete statistics on this phenomenon (emphasis mine:)\n\n> According to the data trackers at [BuzzAngle Music](http:\/\/www.buzzanglemusic.com\/), [on Spotify,] more than **99 percent of audio streaming is of the top 10 percent most-streamed tracks**. Which means **less than 1 percent of streams account for all other music**.\n\n“While streaming media is pitched to us as tailored to our taste, or at least to our browsing history,” Krukowski goes on to note, “the business of it is in fact closer to one-size-fits-all.” Clearly, this is an issue, but technically **only insofar as Spotify advertises itself as a means to discover new music**, which [it does consistently](https:\/\/www.spotify.com\/us\/about-us\/contact\/).\n\nThe company has faced criticism in other areas, most recently by *The New Yorker*’s Alex Ross in a widely-read review of “[Decomposed: The Political Ecology of Music](https:\/\/mitpress.mit.edu\/books\/decomposed),” a new book by University of Oslo professor Kyle Devine, entitled “[The Hidden Costs of Streaming Music](https:\/\/www.newyorker.com\/culture\/cultural-comment\/the-hidden-costs-of-streaming-music).” Ross first cites a statement by Spotify CEO Daniel Elk, “The artists today that are making it realize that it’s about creating a continuous engagement with their fans,” arguing the true meaning of his words to be “to make a living as a musician, you need to claw desperately for attention at every waking hour.” His most original (as in, yet to be considered in the mainstream discourse) argument, though, involves the service’s environmental impact. He cites Devine’s depiction of a profound cultural delusion surrounding the consumption of music, suggesting that music is “seen as a special pursuit that somehow transcends the conditions of its production.”\n\n> In a chapter on the digital and streaming era, Devine drives home the point that there is no such thing as a nonmaterial way of listening to music: “The so-called cloud is a definitely material and mainly hardwired network of fiber-optic cables, servers, routers, and the like.” This concealment of industrial reality, behind a phantasmagoria of virtuality, is a sleight of hand typical of Big Tech, with its genius for persuading consumers never to wonder how transactions have become so shimmeringly effortless.\n\nAlso noteworthy are questions of Spotify’s viability as a business, which Ross includes by citing [a July article in *Barrons*](https:\/\/www.barrons.com\/articles\/spotifys-losses-widen-as-subscribers-keep-growing-51596034688) quoting Spotify Technology’s second-quarter earnings report: “The streaming music company lost $418 million, or $2.24 per share, versus analysts’ expectations for a 41-cent loss.” Spearheading this year’s news conversation surrounding the company, though, were its widespread acquisitions in the Podcasting industry, including [Anchor](https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2019\/2\/6\/18213462\/spotify-podcasts-gimlet-anchor-acquisition), [Megaphone](https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2020\/11\/10\/21557458\/spotify-megaphone-podcast-streaming-ad-insertion), [Gimlet Media](https:\/\/www.vox.com\/2019\/2\/7\/18214941\/alex-blumberg-matt-lieber-gimlet-spotify-deal-acquisition-peter-kafka-media-podcast-audio-interview), and – [most controversially](https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2020\/05\/25\/opinion\/joe-rogan-spotify-podcast.html) – the exclusive rights to the most listened-to property in the medium, [*The Joe Rogan Experience*](https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/21265005\/spotify-joe-rogan-experience-podcast-deal-apple-gimlet-media-ringer). Though details of their implications are beyond the scope of this essay, it is reasonable to assume its concerns – if not its proposed solutions – should apply to the future of podcasting as well.\n\n## Responsible Curation\n\nFor solutions to address Spotify’s overwhelming skew toward rewarding popular music with even more popularity, we can first look within its own history to just a few years earlier, when human curation was more equally matched in its fight against algorithmic curation. In 2015, the company claimed that “[Half of Spotify users stream from other users’ playlists at least monthly](https:\/\/pitchfork.com\/features\/article\/9686-up-next-how-playlists-are-curating-the-future-of-music\/).” *Pitchfork*’s Marc Hogan profiled a number of “power users” within the upper percentile in terms of followers and personal playlist popularity. Notably, all of his examples are male.  \n\nGenerally, human curation should hypothetically combat its algorithmic counterpart in terms of favoring already commercially successful content, if not its gender disparity. The industry’s other biggest player, Apple Music, has invested heavily and successfully in the former. (Disclosure: I have been an Apple Music subscriber since its launch.) *Fast Company* addressed this contrast in a 2018 long read entitled “[Spotify’s $30 billion playlist for global domination](https:\/\/www.fastcompany.com\/90205519\/spotifys-playlist-for-global-domination):”\n\n> Cook’s words embody Apple’s longstanding critique of Spotify, which is that its algorithms are eroding music’s spiritual role in our lives. Cook doesn’t mention Spotify by name but says, “We worry about the humanity being drained out of music, about it becoming a bits-and-bytes kind of world instead of the art and craft.”\n\nThen again, the same article also quotes Tim Cook – the CEO of the most valuable company in the history of the world – as insisting “We’re not in it for the money.” In turn, Daniel Elk is quoted, saying “Music is everything we do all day, all night, and that clarity is the difference between the average and the really, really good,” though what exactly he is quantifying as “really, really good” is not entirely clear. In context, the words of both leaders seem untrustworthy – vague, at best. \n\n<iframe width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/At_K4FVY198?controls=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe>\n\nIn tremendous and relevant contrast to the voices of these CEOs is that of Ethan Diamond, CEO and co-founder of Bandcamp, a music streaming service unlike any other. In [an interview with Music Tech Fest director Andrew Dubber this May](https:\/\/mtflabs.net\/podcast076\/), Diamond exemplifies an entirely different mentality in running a for-profit service for independent music artists. \n\nIn 2007, Diamond and former colleagues Shawn Grunberger, Joe Holt, and Neal Tucker set out to build the equivalent of blogging services like Blogger, WordPress, MovableType, etc. for musicians. As Holt bemoaned in [a 2008 interview with *The HTML Times*](http:\/\/htmltimes.com\/band-camp.php), creating an online presence for one’s music had long been “a pain in the ass:”[^1]\n\n> You need to find a place to host it, you’ve gotta get the metadata right, it’s just hard. So we just decided we would do that hard part for musicians so that they didn’t have to be so nerdy.\n\nFrom its very origin, the team designed Bandcamp to make the process of publishing one’s music as easy as possible. In [the first post on the company’s blog from September, 2008](https:\/\/blog.bandcamp.com\/2008\/09\/16\/hello-cleveland\/), Diamond details the results of their engineering:\n\n> We keep your music streaming and downloading quickly and reliably, whether it’s 3am on a Sunday, or the hour your new record drops and Pitchfork gives it a scathingly positive review. We make your tracks available in every format under the sun, so the audiophilic nerderati can have their FLAC and eat mp3 v2. We adorn your songs with all the right metadata, so they sail into iTunes with artwork, album, band and track names intact. We mutter the various incantations necessary to keep your site top-ranked in Google, so when your fans search for your hits, they find your music long before they find bonkersforlyrics.com or iMyFace. We give your fans easy ways to share your music with their friends, and we give you gorgeous tools that reveal exactly how your music is spreading, so you can fan the fire.\n\nIn the years since, Bandcamp has demonstrated time and time again the sincerity in its commitment to artists through programs like “Bandcamp Fridays,” when the service waives its cut of artists’ revenue (ten percent on physical releases, fifteen percent of digital.) In 2017, the company [donated a Friday’s share of proceeds to the Transgender Law Center](https:\/\/pitchfork.com\/news\/bandcamp-donating-proceeds-to-transgender-law-center-this-friday\/) in response to the Presidential Administration’s proposal to ban trans people from serving in the U.S. military. This year, throughout the Coronavirus pandemic, the company has repeatedly [brought back the program](https:\/\/daily.bandcamp.com\/features\/bandcamp-covid-19-fundraiser) in recognition of its impact on independent artists, and the results have been profound. On March 20th, for a specific example, $4.3 million worth of purchases was distributed.\n\nUnlike Spotify, Bandcamp *is* a profitable company, and has been for nearly a decade. In Dubber’s interview, Diamond explains their financial origins:\n\n> In 2007\/2008 we took a little bit of VC funding and then focused on getting to profitability. So we did that and got there in 2012, and that’s helped us maintain the mission, maintain the vision that we’ve had for the company for a long time.\n\nAlso in contrast to Spotify, Bandcamp explicitly invests in less popular, fringe content, through its online publication the [*Bandcamp Daily*](https:\/\/daily.bandcamp.com): \n\n> The mission of the Daily, it’s our editorial arm, and it’s just to highlight this incredibly diverse world of music that’s on a site where anybody can upload anything. And the result of that is that you have weird subgenres and a lot of music, I think, that wouldn’t necessarily be covered anywhere else.\n\nBandcamp has long demonstrated an anthesis to the business models technology companies have been so criticized for upholding and has done so in relative obscurity from the media. In his interview, Dubber asks Diamond one of the primary questions prompting the creation of this essay: “how come Bandcamp doesn’t get mentioned in all these press articles about music services?” In answer, Diamond offers his own business decisions out of “[his] personal preference:”\n\n> I like the idea that Bandcamp hangs out in the background and just makes all of this stuff work, and also, hopefully, helps the artist promote themselves, and it’s not about “Bandcamp, Bandcamp, Bandcamp.”[^2]\n\nAs a *Tastemaking* enterprise, Bandcamp has combined magazine-style editorial publishing with user-created content in the form of Collections – which allow listeners to display music they’ve purchased on a customizable web page – and Artist Recommendations, which extend from a creator’s Collection to those who follow them. This system has demonstrably lead to community and cultural wellness by genre via responsible commentary and selection from curating creators with authority, while still profiting its parent company tremendously. Bandcamp has grown from four to seventy employees in its 13-year lifespan, [while helping artists earn $634 million](https:\/\/bandcamp.com\/about) as of December 2020. In the music industry, it is unquestionably an outlier. Diamond inadvertently explains Bandcamp’s success in response to a question from Dubber on the company’s comparatively slow pace in terms of technological features (emphasis mine:)\n\n> Deciding what to work on next, that has always felt like the easiest part of the job because it’s whatever benefits artists the most. Because **the way Bandcamp makes money is if artists make a lot more money**, so that’s what we try to spend every day doing.\n\nThe solution to the “debacle” of streaming music, then, is not necessarily charity or socioeconomic revolution. It would seem that all it takes is a sincere investment in the real people who create music.\n\n---\n\n\n[1] While Bandcamp set out from the beginning to make it easier for artists to publish music, getting music on Spotify has always been a grueling process.\n\n[2] I fully intended to quote Kaitlyn Tiffany on how organizations *only* get tech media attention if a significant amount of capital is involved in some form, but I haven’t been able to find it. I’ll certainly come back and add it if\/when I do.\n\n#software #music","views":1642,"updated":"2022-01-15T13:58:21Z","tags":["software","music"],"type":null,"title":"Concerning Discovery in Streaming Music","slug":"streaming-music-discovery","appearance":"norm","language":"en","rtl":false,"created":"2020-12-09T06:00:29Z","images":["https:\/\/i.snap.as\/BROnhF3Z.png","https:\/\/i.snap.as\/jKs57Tfw.png"],"collection":{"public":false,"alias":"bilge","total_posts":0,"title":"The Psalms","verification_link":"","description":"A <a href=\"https:\/\/davidblue.wtf\/db.vcf\">narcoleptic yokel<\/a> on software and culture.","style_sheet":"","views":177027,"monetization_pointer":""},"paid":false},{"id":"da9frvba71aa9utl","body":"![The Psalms 2020 WordCloud](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/zzH7jm4G.png)\n\n## Screens and software subjects big & small discussed within my most moderate 35,000 words ever.\n\n<!--more-->\n\n<audio controls>\n  <source src=\"https:\/\/davidblue.wtf\/audio\/2020.mp3\">\n<\/audio>\n\nBelieve it or not, the cyclical cold season has once again come to pass!

If the past two days on Twitter were any indication, it is indeed time for a year's-end retrospective on what has been published on this Web Site. Given the extent of the attention I've devoted to bilge.world this past year - both technically and editorially - I thought it would be nice to chuck in a bit more in the pursuit of whacking myself on the back. I understand that 2020 has been one helluva catastrophic marker of linear time for just about everyone on Earth - as I write this on its last day, the [inexplicable news of MF Doom's death](https:\/\/www.complex.com\/music\/2020\/12\/mf-doom-dead-49) has just surfaced and has already hit my adjacent communities remarkably hard.\n\nhttps:\/\/twitter.com\/NeoYokel\/status\/1334355680078270464\n\n## Spring\n\nThe earliest archive.org capture of this particular Writeas blog dates back only to [May 1st of this year](http:\/\/bit.ly\/psalmsarchive1), but its stylistic contrast with the site's current version is immense. I believe I was using [Max Henderson's Anxiety theme](https:\/\/write.as\/themes\/anxiety) virtually stock, albeit with some color rearrangements. By the [29th](http:\/\/bit.ly\/3q1d7BM), I had already arrived upon the colors you see today. \"[You Know I'm Blogging](https:\/\/bilge.world\/you-know-im-blogging)\" was just a meta update to say *howdy* after such a long drought, but \"[Dirty Dave's Poweruser Tips](https:\/\/bilge.world\/poweruser-tips-software-shortcuts)\" actually proved popular (for me) among my newly-connected Fedi crowd, especially, thanks to [an annotated share by Writeas on Twitter](https:\/\/twitter.com\/writeas__\/status\/1252704432497836034). Honestly, it was entirely worth it just for the accomplishment of [exposing my platform peer Dino Bansigan to **Alt+D**](https:\/\/journal.dinobansigan.com\/dirty-daves-poweruser-tips-david-blue). Writeas Community Manager CJ Eller and I began corresponding, which led to [an interview](https:\/\/write.as\/community\/chat-with-david-blue) regarding writing tools, managing fiddly compulsions, and the wonder of Markdown.\n\n> I think I'm just now coming around to understanding personal blogging and the freedom that entails. It's been a long while since I've had the urge to write about things on which I don't consider myself at least somewhat of an authority. I think – like many people – I originally just used my personal blog as a guinea pig for messing around with themes, and I'm just now actually catching up on some of the lesser items on my “to-write” list.  \n\nI dug deep in my long-overdue todo list for \"[Z̴͏a͞l͟g͝o͏ ̕G͟͝e͞n͞҉è̛ŗ͡a͝͞t̴o҉r͞ for iOS](https:\/\/bilge.world\/zalgo-generator-ios-app-review),\" which - along with [my 2018 review of Unichar](https:\/\/bilge.world\/unichar-for-ios-app-review) - I felt was a necessary celebration of digital text as a weapon, which is very dear to me. \"[Preferred Writing Instruments](https:\/\/bilge.world\/preferred-writing-instruments)\" was probably the singular analog departure *The Psalms* will ever see and my condensed commentary on [*Star Trek: Picard*](https:\/\/bilge.world\/star-trek-picard-review), [*Star Trek: Discovery*](https:\/\/bilge.world\/star-trek-discovery-review), and [the current state of *Star Trek: Online*](https:\/\/bilge.world\/star-trek-online) should fulfill all need mention of science fiction, here, for a very long time. Given [yesterday's news regarding Slack's acquisition](https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2020\/12\/1\/21719666\/salesforce-slack-acquisition-purchase-announced), perhaps I should feel revalidated in my insistence that \"[Discord is Better Than Slack](https:\/\/bilge.world\/discord-slack-comparison),\" but a developer friend of mine actually addressed my curiosity regarding why startups never mention Discord as a workplace option, despite its identical functionality: it's all about fuckin' *enterprise security*.\n\nI had wanted to write about [*The Langoliers*](https:\/\/letterboxd.com\/film\/the-langoliers\/) - Stephen King's flop of a made-for-TV movie\/extended *Twilight Zone* episode - for a long while. It was probably the first program I watched as a child that genuinely disturbed me and always returns to my thoughts by barren-ish experiences. I had planned to watch the whole three hours all the way through and write whatever came to mind, but I only made it halfway or so in \"[Craig Toomey's Coronavirus](https:\/\/bilge.world\/the-langoliers-stephen-king)\" before I ran completely out of steam. I dropped what I had without revision, to this day. Perhaps one day I shall return...\n\n> In the right hour, the woodland springtime metamorphic processes of the neighboring Lake Geneva suburb’s in-betweens were in a paused state – the toads again hushed; the crickets tired, and the human populace, too. In the right hour, the fickle wind and the social owls were the only sound, and nothing moved but the sparse, light-footed doe in careful segments with her fawn.  \n\nThese two sentences begin the sixth chapter of my indefinitely-postponed novel, [*Blimp's Burden*](https:\/\/github.com\/extratone\/pith), and are almost certainly my best writing, ever. My vanity simply wouldn't allow them to go forgotten, so I [published the chapter as an excerpt on *The Psalms*](https:\/\/bilge.world\/blimps-burden-chapter-6). It may seem an intimidating wall of text, but give it your attention and you'll be amused, I think. \n\n![The Psalms Stats by Post - 2020](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/W3crmS2L.png)\n\n## Summer\n\nThe general, distinctly 21st-century wisdom regarding one's content popularity seems to be something like *you never know what's going to blow up*. I experienced this phenomena quite severely for the first time in my writing life after posting \"[Google Is Not God of The Web](https:\/\/bilge.world\/google-page-experience)\" on [HackerNews](https:\/\/news.ycombinator.com\/item?id=23383548) right before going out-of-touch for some 13 straight hours amidst a local BLM protest. I did not intend to write a baity title, nor did I expect anything to come of sharing it, there - I only did so simply because the thought crossed my mind. Honestly, it is probably the least-considered content I'd ever published on *The Psalms* - I only put it up when I did because I knew *all* of my energy was about to be absorbed for an entire weekend or more. I only started the thing because I felt it important to raise a small voice in reminder that tech media had started using language when discussing code\/online development which had begun to assume the existence of a single, objective standard of measure for *good web design*. (Fuck your bootstrap baloney, [*The Drywall Website*](https:\/\/iowa.neocities.org\/test) was a *real* *paradigm shit*.)\n\nAnd yet... That single goddamned post would end up accruing more pageviews than all of my writing on the web, combined (I suspect.) Tens of thousands of words were written in hundreds of comments, which I did my best to parse in [a *for the hell of it* substack email](https:\/\/davidblue.substack.com\/p\/witness-google-god-and-local-history):\n\n> Out of everything I’ve shared on *Bilge* recently, it’s hilarious that this particular post - on which I spent a cumulative total of perhaps 25 minutes writing and made less effort than ever to edit - became probably my most widely-shared work of all time.  \n\nOnce again, I *am* thankful for the readership and correspondence, I just *really fucking wish* it had been on literally *anything* else I've written about technology.\n\nIn retrospect, it really is bonkers that I was excited about yet another vague promise to *re-imagine email* in the days surrounding [the launch of Basecamp's HEY](https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2020\/6\/15\/21286466\/hey-email-basecamp-price-availability-platforms-launch), but I feel it's important to nurture what paltry genuine enthusiasm remains about technology and the future, so I decided to respond to the service's homepage prompt, asking interested visitors to write in with their own thoughts on email. I spent a morning clacking out \"[Email and I: An Abridged History](https:\/\/bilge.world\/hey-email-history),\" which I hope will one day serve as a part-foundation for a thorough, composed extension to my [*Why I Write About Technology*](https:\/\/gist.github.com\/extratone\/91ebe16b0c620f309e70b40f5d4dcd9e) series. This would be *The Psalms* last relevant work for a few months, while I played around with [an experimental WordPress website](https:\/\/www.davidblue.wtf\/wordpress-experimentation\/) and dove into [*fuckin' school*](https:\/\/www.davidblue.wtf\/college-return\/) for the first time in seven years.\n\n![WTF](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/cwm5gKqi.png)\n\n## Fall\n\nI returned in late September with a partial recount of what I'd discovered: \"[Indulging Once More in Digital Excess](https:\/\/bilge.world\/digital-excess).\" After exploring the concept of [*Digital Gardens*](https:\/\/tomcritchlow.com\/blogchains\/digital-gardens\/), buying [my first pro-ready desktop PC](https:\/\/www.davidblue.wtf\/hp-envy-desktop\/) in 10 years, playing with Big Boy Adobe software for the first time, and reading [a delightful book](https:\/\/www.hup.harvard.edu\/catalog.php?isbn=9780674417076) documenting the history of word processing, I arrived upon the term *Software Historian* with which to partially describe myself. It doesn't mean all that much at the moment, but will no doubt be explored imminently on this Web Site.\n\nAddressing \"[The Social Dilemma's Dilemma](https:\/\/bilge.world\/the-social-dilemma)\" and \"[Software Thanksgiving](https:\/\/bilge.world\/big-thank)\" in detail would be awfully redundant, but I would at least note how they represent diametrically opposed perspectives through which to discuss this stuff. Going forward into 2021, I think it's important that I hold short on the progress I've made in moderating my voice since 2018. *Digestibility* is not a virtue I am at all interested in, nor is it an appropriate one in which to invest any more effort. Any non-*radical* argument will inevitably prove enormously unoriginal, which makes for a huge waste of all our time. For the moment, that's all the editorializing I've done.\n\n![Blogging vs.](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/T4Z1w1nI.jpg)\n\n## Three Point Oh\n\nSomewhere along the research process for one of my school essays, I came across the concept of academic [revision tracking and peer review via Git](https:\/\/www.davidblue.wtf\/git-peer-review\/). Having dipped my toe back in academia, any such circumvention of its penchant for the most archaic practices possible was naturally intriguing. *Just wait until I show these goons how to use hyperlinks.* Perhaps inevitably, I was launched into the Git-Gone Bender I'm still riding simply because I finally had ample reason to actually understand it. In just two months, I've created and forked a total of nearly 80 repositories on [my new GitHub account](https:\/\/github.com\/extratone). Though I'd created one for each of my web properties ages ago, I had absolutely no idea how to actually make use of them, so they were all quickly abandoned. In the past two weeks or so, I think I've actually begun to get the hang of the system's core intricacies, best exemplified by [*The Psalms*' Repository](https:\/\/github.com\/extratone\/bilge) as it stands.\n\nThe \"automated\" [Project Board](https:\/\/github.com\/extratone\/bilge\/projects\/1) I set up has so far been a very impressive replacement for the simple todo list. It tracks and categorizes Post Ideas in their various stages in my process: Mulling, Documentation (research,) Drafting, and actual Publication. Technical \"[Issues](https:\/\/github.com\/extratone\/bilge\/issues)\" regarding the CMS and\/or the Repository, itself, have also fit in these categories well, so far. Just today, I discovered that one can simply tag Issues by their number to describe [Commits](https:\/\/github.com\/extratone\/bilge\/commits\/main), which form an impressive revision-tracking changelog when aggregated together. I also figured out the general idea behind Milestones and set [*The Psalms*' first one](https:\/\/github.com\/extratone\/bilge\/milestone\/1) for my 27th birthday, next month. The goal is to have figured this all out well enough by then that I'm no longer randomly stumbling upon entire featuresets multiple times in a workday. [*Thinking in Public*](https:\/\/tomcritchlow.com\/2020\/07\/23\/thinking-in-public\/) - as my friend Tom Critchlow and his crowd say - is what I'm trying to do here, I think. Obviously, this really means that you are more than welcome to hop the fuck in at any time, in any manner you'd prefer. If Git is still no more than a conundrum for you - as it was for me just weeks ago - I would suggest the directory for [In-Progress Drafts](https:\/\/github.com\/extratone\/bilge\/tree\/main\/Drafts) as a starting point.\n\nhttps:\/\/twitter.com\/NeoYokel\/status\/1336374708753797123\n\n[GitHub Actions](https:\/\/github.com\/extratone\/bilge\/actions) are still more or less a mystery to me, but I am unbothered - *The Psalms*' seems to be producing green text instead of red, now, in the midst of whatever I set it up to do. I poked around the livestreams for \"GitHub Universe\" a few weeks ago, when dark mode and GitHub Discussions were opened up to more users. At the moment, I cannot imagine a single application for forums in the context of my blog's repository, but [I turned them on, anyway](https:\/\/github.com\/extratone\/bilge\/discussions). It's very possible that all of the documentation-generating functions of Git are entirely unnecessary in this case, but - as I entrust GitHub with the eternal task of archiving such work - it is my hope that it will help me add further structure to my process.\n\n![Caslon Bilge Type Capture](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/vMsQQHSG.png)\n\nIf you've found yourself in possession of a .edu email address and are interested in GitHub related experimentation, see [this list of discounted\/free dev programs\/services for students](https:\/\/education.github.com\/pack\/offers), which includes a free subscription to \"GitHub Pro.\" (Apparently, equivalent to a $4\/month service.) Adobe has [similar discounts](https:\/\/www.adobe.com\/creativecloud\/buy\/students.html), as you’re probably already aware, which have allowed me to pursue my goal of learning InDesign. So far, I’ve created a sort of [commemorative 404 page for *The Drynet*](https:\/\/www.behance.net\/gallery\/104230341\/Four-Oh-Four) and a [font showcase of Georgia](https:\/\/www.behance.net\/gallery\/104229721\/Moms-Georgia-Type-Specimen) for my mother. As much as I’d love to continue discussing the current state of Adobe apps, I’ve realized 1) I am quite distinct from a *professional user*, which is why I genuinely find GIMP more useful than Photoshop, for instance, and 2) given the length of my to-write list considering my current pace, I don’t know if I’d manage to get around to it in this lifetime.\n\nhttps:\/\/youtube.com\/watch?v=wrhh8zDH-AA\n\nBetween now and the 11th of this month, I will be migrating worthwhile posts from the experimental WordPress site (WTF) here and closing its hosting account. I haven’t been compelled to actually do anything with it in months, and the handy redirects, alone, are not worth the upcosts, however fair. Some content - including the corresponding posts for my Adobe experiments *will not* be imported from WTF here. I’m also going to rely on [the Web Archive](https:\/\/bit.ly\/39VJ2y6) for publishing the rest. Notable discoveries so far include “[Through an iPhone 4’s Lens](https:\/\/bilge.world\/iphone4-photography),” which is a reminder of how revolutionary that particular handset was, and a few extra-Psalms pieces of content I’d like you to experience, like [this Notion gallery](https:\/\/www.notion.so\/rotund\/7f4664a737d1429eb94d33cb3486e9e0?v=aad96df288034d2dbe4dd667d6b7f543) of my single jaunt into drawing, [# DavidBlueDraws](https:\/\/twitter.com\/hashtag\/davidbluedraws). Best of all is my friend [Tevin’s episode of *Extratone*’s defunct flagship podcast](https:\/\/anchor.fm\/extratone\/episodes\/Esporting-Psycholiterates--Favored-of-Email-en398f\/a-a3vklt8). In the years since, he’s become quite the prolific [Twitch streamer](https:\/\/twitch.tv\/YourBudTevin). (I’ve watched enough and know Tevin well enough to say that he’s particularly entertaining in this medium.)\n\n<iframe allow=\"autoplay *; encrypted-media *; fullscreen *\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"175\" style=\"width:100%;max-width:660px;overflow:hidden;background:transparent;\" sandbox=\"allow-forms allow-popups allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-storage-access-by-user-activation allow-top-navigation-by-user-activation\" src=\"https:\/\/embed.podcasts.apple.com\/us\/podcast\/esporting-psycholiterates-favored-of-email\/id1400636220?i=1000500606715\"><\/iframe>\n\n## Coming Soon\n\nFor better or worse, all of these new exploratory avenues have so far led directly away from the business of *actually writing*, but - in my best self-estimation - I suspect I’m mostly done with fiddling, now, and ready to start thinking on the page, again. Predictably, I’ve let my upcoming [iPhone 12 Pro Max Review](https:\/\/github.com\/extratone\/bilge\/issues\/45) turn into quite a monstrosity over the past two months. It turns out, years of lapsed attention toward iOS development resulted in my feeling more out-of-the-loop than I expected, which I was compelled to remedy, naturally. If you’re so inclined, you can follow the minutia attached to my review process via [this dedicated Snapas gallery](https:\/\/snap.as\/extratone\/iphone-12-pro-max), [this shared iCloud album](https:\/\/bit.ly\/12bbbp), my [personal YouTube channel](http:\/\/bit.ly\/psalmsyt) , and [this Twitter collection](https:\/\/bit.ly\/ip12pmtw).\n\nhttps:\/\/twitter.com\/NeoYokel\/status\/1344555610155712512\n\nAs per my newfound use of GitHub, I’ve played around with various ways of documenting this journey, specifically. First is [this Wiki page](https:\/\/github.com\/extratone\/bilge\/wiki\/David-Blue-on-iPhone-&-iOS) (which I shall do my best to remember to keep updated) listing the entirety of my writing history on iPhone and iOS. (It’s uh... A bit underwhelming, if I’m honest.) I’ve also just begun a [dedicated repository](https:\/\/github.com\/extratone\/i) for iOS-related documentation and resources, which will soon include a full, sensically-indexed list of iCloud share links to my entire Siri Shortcuts collection (I hope.) Immediately following the review, I intend to publish here a post [dedicated to functions Apple has failed to properly document](https:\/\/github.com\/extratone\/bilge\/issues\/56), which I expect to be the most widely-useful content on this domain. To see some of the suggestions I’ve received so far and\/or to add your own, see [this mildly-successful thread](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/ios\/comments\/l5p7ly\/underdocumented_ios_functions_stuff_you_wish) I posted in r\/iOS.\n\nhttps:\/\/youtube.com\/watch?v=uXIXjAWXVfQ\n\nWhen I have finally tired of talking about handsets once more, I hope to return my attention toward some other overwhelmingly-ambitious monstrosities like my [academic paper](https:\/\/github.com\/extratone\/bigblue) proposing federated, open-source social networks in favor of the Big Boys, my [report](https:\/\/github.com\/extratone\/bilge\/issues\/44) on the experience of returning to academia for a semester in 2020, and my [evaluation of Notion](https:\/\/github.com\/extratone\/bilge\/issues\/12) as perhaps the next Big Step in the evolution of notetaking software. Perhaps before tackling projects the size of these, I intend to compile another [listicle of handy tips](https:\/\/github.com\/extratone\/bilge\/issues\/28) for newcomers to Writeas. As I linked before, you can now view the entirety of *The Psalms’* status in as much detail as you’d like via [its Project Board on GitHub](https:\/\/github.com\/extratone\/bilge\/projects\/1). As always, you can delight me by directly engaging on [Twitter](http:\/\/twitter.com\/neoyokel), [Mastodon](https:\/\/mastodon.social\/@DavidBlue), [Discord](http:\/\/bit.ly\/holeguest), and\/or via [email](mailto:davidblue@extratone.com). Let’s hope 2021’s equivalent of this review doesn’t take me until February to publish!\n\n#meta","views":1467,"updated":"2022-01-15T13:57:56Z","tags":["meta"],"type":null,"title":"The Psalms' 2020","slug":"2020","appearance":"norm","language":"en","rtl":false,"created":"2021-02-04T22:50:45Z","images":["https:\/\/i.snap.as\/zzH7jm4G.png","https:\/\/i.snap.as\/W3crmS2L.png","https:\/\/i.snap.as\/cwm5gKqi.png","https:\/\/i.snap.as\/T4Z1w1nI.jpg","https:\/\/i.snap.as\/vMsQQHSG.png"],"collection":{"public":false,"alias":"bilge","total_posts":0,"title":"The Psalms","verification_link":"","description":"A <a href=\"https:\/\/davidblue.wtf\/db.vcf\">narcoleptic yokel<\/a> on software and culture.","style_sheet":"","views":177027,"monetization_pointer":""},"paid":false},{"id":"r1xnciee1ui3pwpb","body":"","views":0,"updated":"2021-02-15T10:29:26Z","tags":[],"type":null,"title":"","slug":"r1xnciee1ui3pwpb","appearance":"sans","language":"","rtl":false,"created":"2021-02-15T10:30:01Z","collection":{"public":false,"alias":"extratone","total_posts":0,"title":"Extratone","verification_link":"","description":"For the New Curious.","style_sheet":"","views":182661,"monetization_pointer":""},"paid":false},{"id":"c7r6cj5n2uryo7j4","body":"![Modern VGA Logo Orange](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/COqvh2ZZ.png)\n\n## Today, the VGAs celebrate a whole decade of curation.\n\nhttps:\/\/youtube.com\/watch?v=QbUtmpSKMGg\n\n### What?\n\nAn annual reflectory awards ceremony examining video games across platforms, continents, and genres wrapped in a feature-length motion graphics flex\/sensory assault full of internet jokes.\n\n### When?\n\n**Feb 27, 2021 at 1900 EST (7PM)**\nSee: [Every Time & Date Page](https:\/\/www.timeanddate.com\/worldclock\/fixedtime.html?msg=2020+Vidya+Gaem+Awards&iso=2021-02-27T17:28:00&p1=179)\n\n### Where?\n\n[Twitch](https:\/\/twitch.tv\/vidyagaemawards), [YouTube](https:\/\/youtube.com\/c\/VidyaGaemAwards), and [Discord](https:\/\/discord.com\/invite\/4e8JQB4) (if you’d like to chat)\n\n|                       Essential Links                        |\n| :----------------------------------------------------------: |\n| [The VGAs’ super-slick web site for 2020](http:\/\/vidyagaemawards.com) |\n|      [VGAs Discord](https:\/\/discord.com\/invite\/4e8JQB4)      |\n|     [VGAs Twitter](https:\/\/twitter.com\/vidyagaemawards)      |\n| [VGAs Steam Group](https:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/groups\/thevidyagaemawards) |\n| [VGAs YouTube Channel](https:\/\/youtube.com\/c\/VidyaGaemAwards) |\n|   [VGAs Twitch Channel](https:\/\/twitch.tv\/vidyagaemawards)   |\n\n*If you consumed\/participated in the live show, consider having a go at this year's [Feedback Form](https:\/\/forms.gle\/ZL6fYu3mx5KNJKtH8).*\n\n<!--comment-->\n\n#juegos","views":1614,"updated":"2023-04-01T14:56:48Z","tags":["juegos"],"type":null,"title":"The 10th Annual Vidya Gaem Awards","slug":"vga-2020","appearance":"norm","language":"en","rtl":false,"created":"2021-02-27T18:00:00Z","images":["https:\/\/i.snap.as\/COqvh2ZZ.png"],"collection":{"public":false,"alias":"extratone","total_posts":0,"title":"Extratone","verification_link":"","description":"For the New Curious.","style_sheet":"","views":182661,"monetization_pointer":""},"paid":false},{"id":"u6ef9asnaojlq8n9","body":"![Tweetbot Resurrection](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/hAYKYfwL.jpg)\n\n## In the bleak face of Twitter’s centralization, Tapbots refuses to give up on its mobile client.\n\n<!--more-->\n\n*Listen to this article read by Siri below...*\n\n<audio controls>\n  <source src=\"https:\/\/davidblue.wtf\/audio\/Tweetbot6.m4a\">\n<\/audio>\n\nWere it just I who came to you with only my voice on this cold night, proclaiming the imminent release of a whole numerical version of a third-party mobile Twitter client in 2021, you really would have no choice but to send for the laws, for you’d be left no consideration other than my comprehensive descent into absolute insanity. [825 days ago](https:\/\/bilge.world\/tweetbot-5-ios-review), I told you lots about the history surrounding the development of Tweetbot 5, which I confidently described as “likely the last com­pet­i­tive third-par­ty Twit­ter app for iOS.” After spending the past few months diving deep into iOS in preparation to [review and reflect](https:\/\/github.com\/extratone\/bilge\/issues\/45) upon Apple’s current flagship handset, my eyes have been opened to the exponentially-increasing pace of the whole environment’s metamorphosis during the course of my lapsed attention. In the name of progress, I’ve done my best to make a point of looking back, too, yet something astonishingly personally relevant managed to slip past me until just last week: **there is a sixth version of the Tweetbot app**. At this moment, [it is listed on the App Store](https:\/\/apps.apple.com\/us\/app\/tweetbot-6-for-twitter\/id1527500834) as an “Early Release” version, though its predecessor can still be downloaded by those who’ve already purchased it in the past, like me. This is an unusual practice - usually, pre-release versions of iOS apps can only be distributed through Apple’s developer beta testing infrastructure, though Testflight. Notably, Tweetbot developer company Tapbots was [apparently required](https:\/\/twitter.com\/tapbot_paul\/status\/1354145779494100992?s=21) to take down Tweetbot 5’s store listing 30 days before releasing Tweetbot 6.\n\nhttps:\/\/soundcloud.com\/compaqclub\/macstories-on-tweetbot-6\n\nI can’t remember exactly why - though I suspect I was just fucking around on my phone before bed, bleary-eyed - but the implications of this next numeral passed me by the first time I saw and downloaded Tweetbot 6, two weeks ago. Perhaps it’s because the app didn’t appear to have any new features - in fact, it’s technically got *less* than 5, though those that have been removed - user-specified URL shortening, image hosting, and video hosting services - haven’t worked in a good while anyway. As my old fav, *The Verge* noted in [their coverage of 6](https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2021\/1\/26\/22250899\/tweetbot-6-tapbots-ios-app-update-subscription-service-twitter-api), blame for these omissions rests solely on Twitter, Inc., itself, who’s continued to hold its API development inordinately close-to-chest. I didn’t bother to find out about this, though, because my first assumptions upon poking around the new app - especially after encountering its new subscription requirement in order to use any of its substantive features - was that its developers had ceased any actual time investment into the app long ago, and that 6 was a new version in number and rudimentary visual updates, only, shoved out in hopes of peaking old, loyal users like myself enough to get us to download it, at least. In the disappointment I’d already expected, I closed and immediately deleted the app.\n\nI’ve paused everything else to write you on this, though, because the story is actually much bigger. Had I investigated any further that first time, I would have discovered an odd amount of buzz coming from even the most mainstream of tech media in a simple search. (Yes, I am ashamed about it.) You’re still reading, but perhaps - as I was, originally - you are doing so from an appropriately-jaded, well-read perspective on software, generally, in 2021. Perhaps you’re looking at the search results, yourself, and wondering if you’re dreaming. *Dedicated coverage of a fucking third-party Twitter client iteration??? At this point in history? What in fuck?* I’m fairly certainly neither of us are, though: fucking Tweetbot made headlines on [Engadget](https:\/\/www.engadget.com\/tweebot-6-tapbots-twitter-app-subscription-model-launch-110526052.html), [TechCrunch](https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/01\/26\/tweetbot-6-released-with-new-subscription-pricing\/), [9to5Mac](https:\/\/9to5mac.com\/2021\/01\/26\/tweetbot-6-new-features-subscription-model\/), [MacStories](https:\/\/www.macstories.net\/news\/tweetbot-6-moves-to-subscription-pricing\/), [iMore](https:\/\/www.imore.com\/tweetbot-6-update-popular-twitter-app-and-it-brings-subscription-model), [MacRumors](https:\/\/www.macrumors.com\/2021\/01\/26\/tweetbot-6-subscription-pricing-change\/), and [others](https:\/\/github.com\/extratone\/bilge\/blob\/main\/docs\/tb6links.md). No, it’s not 2010 again. In fact, *The Verge*, at least, has never given up on Tweetbot. If my long term memory had been functioning, I would have remembered noticing its spot in “[12 great apps for your new iPhone in 2020](https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/platform\/amp\/22187376\/best-iphone-apps-2020-apple-ios):”\n\n> Twitter is a vaguely terrible way to spend your time these days, but if you (like me) can’t tear yourself away from the social media service \/ entryway into hell, you’ll want Tweetbot, which actually makes using Twitter far less painful. Tweetbot shows you the tweets of the people you follow, in the order that they tweeted them. There are no ads or promoted tweets, powerful mute filters to block out unwanted noise, and (thanks to Twitter’s unfriendly API changes) no notifications to constantly ping you to come back to the app.\n\nHere’s to Chaim for exposing me to a perspective I never would have otherwise considered: Tweetbot’s lack of push notifications as a *positive*. If you’re wondering, no, this new app does not ~yet~ include any additional notification integration, and it’s not clear whether or not it’s on Tapbots future roadmap for the app, or where. As for the reality of integrating Tweetbot 6 into your current Twitter use, I stand by my argument\tthat deleting the native Twitter app isn’t really an option if you plan to ever view your notifications on your phone. The popular assumption (I assume) if you’re still reading is that you are a “poweruser,” meaning details about my own configuration are probably irrelevant. If by chance you’ve just downloaded Tweetbot for the first time, you should take the time to disable notifications for Tweetbot entirely, but leave them on for the native Twitter app, even if you decide to banish it to your App Library. Before I began any work on this review, I made sure to swap in Tweetbot 6 where the native app had been in my dock for several years, now. I originally pushed the native app all the way to page 6, but immediately found this extreme. Instead, I put it in the bottom-right corner in my second screen, as you can see in the screenshot below (which also serves as proof, if you needed it.)\n\n![Tweetbot vs Native Twitter Proof](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/WMyY9kLc.png)\n\nI should also note how much my own engagement on Twitter has diminished in the past 3-5 years. Not to manifest tiny violins - in turn, my engagement on (and investment in) [Mastodon](http:\/\/bit.ly\/dbmasto) has increased exponentially, and it’s of a *much* higher quality. I bring it up for context’s sake: I can afford to prioritize Tweetbot in my Twitter use because of how few daily notifications I get - a number which is unusual for someone who uses Twitter as much as I do. Inevitably, my own use is once again going to factor heavily in this work, as is the significance of my relationship with Twitter, generally, in my life. If you didn’t already know, I’ve met basically all of my friends since high school through Twitter. As of this moment, my private “Friends” Twitter List includes 149 accounts, and I’ve spent more than 10 years, now, reading almost every single one of their Tweets. I have been as critical of the service as anyone, but - whether or not either of us are willing to acknowledge it, wholly - I believe the intimacy of this arrangement to exceed that of any in-person relationship *I* have ever had. Reading the random thoughts of these people seconds or minutes after they’ve popped into their heads for all this time has been an experience unique to the format Twitter pioneered, if not to the service, itself. I have no choice but to acknowledge that I am *deeply* invested in not just Twitter, but Twitter’s less-than-visible Lists feature, emotionally and intellectually. When I hit my [follow limit](https:\/\/twitter.com\/neoyokel\/status\/1281646353102147584), several years ago, Lists also became my single means of acquiring new connections on the network. If it were to be removed, I would lose this ability, entirely, as well as any reasonable means of communicating with any of my friends.\n\nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=IO-ZSD-vymc\n\nPerhaps you understand, now, why I have [written](https:\/\/bilge.world\/twitter-lists) and [Tweeted](https:\/\/twitter.com\/i\/events\/996616971880882176) so extensively about Lists. You should also understand just how miraculous the possibility of Tweetbot’s new future now seems, personally, unless you’re new to all of these ideas and don’t feel like reading that big olé Tweetbot 5 review of mine (which is fine.) Before I go into the history of Tweetbot, let me first share the single most telling feature in Tweetbot of Tapbots’ belief in using Lists and share some evidence of *others’* present day belief in Tweetbot. Shamefully, I’ve spent several years - tens, if not hundreds of thousands of hours - using Lists in Tweetbot, oblivious to its upmost Lists integration: “[Use Lists as Timeline](https:\/\/tapbots.com\/support\/tweetbot6\/tips\/list.php).” Had I actually bothered to look at the support docs at any point, I would have discovered this long ago, which would have almost certainly made my given year. **If you use Tweetbot and Lists, for the love of Gourd, please take a look**. Here’s what those docs currently say, in full:\n\n> One long time Tweetbot feature is the ability to use any of your lists as your main timeline. To do this, all you have to do is hold down on the “Timeline” label in the navigation bar (in the timeline tab) and a menu populated with your lists will appear. Select one and that will become your current timeline. You can switch to another list or back to your main timeline any time by performing the same action.\n\nEven after reading this multiple times, it still was not obvious to me what it was talking about, and I was unable to find precisely *zero* visuals on The World Wide Web of this action taking place, so I recorded and uploaded [the video embedded above](https:\/\/youtu.be\/IO-ZSD-vymc). Good God, how I wish I’d been a more detail-oriented young man! I’ll be privatizing my self-punishment from here on out, though, so bear with me.\n\n![Lists Integration | Tweetbot 6](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/oZ5u34QP.png)\n\nThe discourse surrounding Tapbots’ recent announcement has already reached a higher decibel count than I would have ever expected, so it’s obvious there are plenty of *users* who still [love Tweetbot](https:\/\/twitter.com\/neoyokel\/status\/1064579914538602496), and you already know from the beforelinked stories that *The Verge* has also stood firmly by it as the preferred Twitter experience. It takes a wee bit of digging, though, to discover the subtle bets on both Tweetbots and Lists from no less than Apple, Inc., itself. In the official Apple Shortcuts Gallery, a curated list entitled “Twitter Better” includes “[Open Twitter Lists](https:\/\/www.icloud.com\/shortcuts\/161bb19df7ee47fa8b31a0c0fb43307b)” at number 1. In 5th position is “[Open in Tweetbot](https:\/\/www.icloud.com\/shortcuts\/c148d4f0dfbc45d6bf8bad6bb67d519c),” and “[Open in Twitter App](https:\/\/www.icloud.com\/shortcuts\/c45206139b9e47eb8de780e686350022)” (3rd,) is configured *by default* to first ask you to choose between Tweetbot and Twitter’s native app, despite its title.\n\n![Tweetbot Bets in Shortcuts](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/sZXfdk8L.png)\n\nAs for App Store rankings, the fact that Tweetbot 5 was forcibly removed from public listings makes it impossible to meaningfully judge recent popularity of Tweetbot on iPhone\/iPad. Its MacOS-based sibling, though (called Tweetbot 3,) was the *second most popular* paid app [on the Mac App Store](https:\/\/apps.apple.com\/us\/app\/tweetbot-3-for-twitter\/id1384080005) as of [February 6th, 2020](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/Uq8bRMF8.png). That’s the day I borrowed my Mom’s MacBook Pro for a short while to check up on MacOS Big Sur, when I downloaded the current version (3.5.2, if you wanted to know) of Tapbots’ desktop Twitter client and [messed around with it](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?t=219&v=vHDNdMux16g) enough to tell you that it’s as wonderful as ever. (Had I not switched back to Windows as my primary desktop OS a decade ago, I would use it every single day.)\n\n![Tweetbot 3 for MacOS Version 3.5.2](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/1bbw5iFH.png)\n\nI suspect most active Twitter users in 2021 would be even more surprised to discover Tweetbot’s remaining, discreet hold on today’s Twitter experience than I was, assuming most of them joined more recently than myself and those I regularly interact with. For the sake of this Post, I reached out to Tapbots with an interview request about “Tweetbot’s roadmap, Apple’s requirement that [they] remove 5 from the App Store 30 days beforehand, and why [they’ve] decided to take this (risky, imo) bet on making our lives better,” though I don’t expect a reply, which is fine. They *did* respond to my support request regarding hardware keyboard shortcut support very quickly, saying they’ll look into it. (Without being verbose, I’ll just tell you that if a near future update to the app fixes the F and ⌘ + R shortcuts, I *will* shit out my whole ass.)\n\n![All Tweetbot Themes](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/W884QXpS.png)\n\n## The Business at Hand\n\nBefore I dig into the controversy and hypotheticals surrounding what Tweetbot 6 might become, let’s take a moment to qualify it vs all of one’s options to interact with Twitter on iOS *currently* (as in, Feb 11, 2021 at 19:24.) It’s almost certainly premature to do so, but skeptical readers would note, I’m sure, that its [listing on the App Store](https:\/\/apps.apple.com\/us\/app\/tweetbot-6-for-twitter\/id1527500834) is “early release” in name only, that I have just spent money on this specific version, which should therefore render inert the normal exceptions a review would make for beta or pre-release software. If you’ve somehow come across this Post before reading anything else about Tweetbot 6 and simply want to know **what is new** for this version compared with 5.5.3 (its predecessor’s most recent release,) the frank answer as it stands is *not much*. Perhaps I’m doing something wrong, here, but the [YouTube videos and tech media articles](https:\/\/github.com\/extratone\/bilge\/blob\/main\/docs\/tb6links.md) I could find dealing with the subject of additions, specifically, were all either misleading, entirely wrong, or both.\n\n![Account Settings | Tweetbot 5 vs Tweetbot 6](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/7aSwOoGn.png)\n\nWhile 6 lists one more option (for a total of 9) under Themes in the Display section of the app’s Settings menu, none are substantive variations of the same themes you’re familiar with from 5. “Future Light” is just a more turquoise variant of the “Default” blue UI theme in 5. In fact, the singular change in the Display menu is the addition of “San Francisco Rounded” under the Fonts selection. Below, you can see side-by-side screenshots of the Tweet Detail view in Tweetbot 5 vs. Tweetbot 6, with the regular SFUI font on the left and rounded variant on the right (text size slider set to max on both apps.)\n\n![Tweet Detail | Tweetbot 5 vs Tweetbot 6](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/I8RC6RUM.png)\n\nTo be honest, I can’t really tell the difference between the typefaces in this view, but have used the new app enough to know I prefer the latter. More topically exemplified in that image is Tweetbot 6’s new support for social cards, which the Tapbots boys have executed in a startlingly beautiful way that puts Twitter to shame and makes one feel like you’ve taken them for granted these past few years. Also in that vein and more than worthy of the same accolades is Tweetbot 6’s support for Twitter polls. They’ve never looked so good.\n\n![Poll Support in Tweetbot 6](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/kCCCZzh5.png)\n\nSomewhat on-trend, the app also includes two new icons, but - if we’re being 100% frank - they’re a paltry, dated-looking afterthought and Tweetbot deserves (*needs*, even) better branding. If I were allowed a singular compulsion to impress upon its developers, I’d make them put out a public call for new art. I’m all but dying to see what the community would come up with.\n\nSo, if you were wondering what the fuck Tapbots have been doing these past 3+ years, you should now have the basal bullet points of your answer. The Greater Truth about this gosh darned Twitter app (and why its long-respected developers are now asking you for a whole dollar a month,) though, requires a broader look.\n\nhttps:\/\/youtube.com\/watch?v=DE1YHcoPxMk\n\n## Slow & Steady\n\nFor as long as I can remember, both the MacOS and iOS versions of Tweetbot have always possessed a more-or-less undefinable (perhaps Apple Development- specific) quality that’s noticeably set them apart from their direct competitors. I didn’t fully understand why they “feel” so much more “right” until I started making my way through this [list of all the interviews\/podcast appearances](https:\/\/github.com\/extratone\/bilge\/issues\/59#issuecomment-778762784) by Tapbots’ iOS code wizard, [Paul Haddad](https:\/\/twitter.com\/tapbot_paul), who comments in variations the same argument for a *very* deliberate developmental pace. The first time, with a *MacWorld* journalist on some steps outside WWDC 2013, I assumed he was just tossing some self-deprecation around to casualize the interview:\n\n*Frankly, we’re slow at doing stuff.*\n\nYes, you are, Tapbot… From a returning user’s perspective, it’s hard to understand what in Gourd’s name they’ve been doing. I listened and read through every Tapbots interview I could find - all but one with Paul, who has through the years continued to come across as a sensitive, well-read, even *wise* professional developer with a healthy, professional outlook on the work of his little (relatively) weathered company and its place within the warp speed nightmare that is the mobile software industry. I suppose I was expecting to find an explanation for what I saw initially as a minimal regard for Tweetbot’s history, in contrast to 6’s announcement. I wouldn’t find it, though, because in truth, I was sure I already knew it: Twitter made it clear over a decade ago - just after they’d purchased Tweetie and slapped their own name on it - that they had no intention of competing in the client space, so [third-party developers were no longer welcome](https:\/\/www.macstories.net\/stories\/twitter-to-developers-enough-with-the-twitter-clients\/).\n\n> Developers have told us that they’d like more guidance from us about the best opportunities to build on Twitter. More specifically, developers ask us if they should build client apps that mimic or reproduce the mainstream Twitter consumer client experience. The answer is no.\n>\n> As we point out above, we need to move to a less fragmented world, where every user can experience Twitter in a consistent way.\n\nI’ve spent enough time in The App Space (read: Phone Dude Hell) to expect a lot of melodrama, largely without judgement, considering how generally awful the big vendors have made the whole situation. The business legality of the story was [spiked into the mainstream conversation](https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2020\/06\/19\/opinion\/apple-app-store-hey.html) last year by [controversy](https:\/\/reddit.com\/r\/extratown\/comments\/hbncn6\/news_surrounding_hey_the_upcoming_email_service\/) encouraged by Basecamp following some pretty toxic, retaliatory correspondence from Apple regarding their plan to subsidize their new email service, HEY. Frankly, I’ve found such stories - about clashes between big software companies over mediocre, uninspiring, and sometimes just downright *bad* software - ridiculously exhausting and less and less interesting, lately, as I’ve realized that the most innovative, quality work I have experienced has basically all come from the tiniest teams. The most groundbreaking projects and products I’ve bothered to show and tell, here - [Unichar](https:\/\/bilge.world\/unichar-for-ios-app-review), [Zalgo Generator](https:\/\/bilge.world\/zalgo-generator-ios-app-review), [Bear](https:\/\/bilge.world\/poweruser-tips-software-shortcuts), [Toot!](https:\/\/youtu.be\/LdBFMibyh3Y), [Mastonaut](https:\/\/youtu.be\/k7KDk-VV6wc), [Mast](https:\/\/youtu.be\/8Sss0gzpoeQ), etc. - were all built by individual developers except for Shiny Frog’s Bear. (Their team currently numbers 16, by my count.) Each one of those hyperlinks eventually leads to a form of my same rant: **why the fuck won’t tech media talk about genuine innovation anymore**.\n\n<iframe allow=\"autoplay *; encrypted-media *; fullscreen *\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"175\" style=\"width:100%;max-width:660px;overflow:hidden;background:transparent;\" sandbox=\"allow-forms allow-popups allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-storage-access-by-user-activation allow-top-navigation-by-user-activation\" src=\"https:\/\/embed.podcasts.apple.com\/us\/podcast\/mark-jardine-and-paul-haddad-tapbots-founders-talk-21\/id1164554936?i=1000388739028\"><\/iframe>\n\nAs I read and listened through Tweetbot’s history for this work, it occurred to me that I might be neglecting to acknowledge an age old divide in development philosophy across platforms. In the singular instance both Tweetbot devs appeared together in a podcast interview - a [Founder’s Talk episode from 10 whole years ago](https:\/\/changelog.com\/founderstalk\/21) - Paul Haddad addressed the *when is it gonna be done* question in a comprehensive and particularly illuminating way:\n\n> I personally hate that question because, you know… it just will get done when it gets done… We’re definitely slow. We go over every screen, every detail over and over again until we get it right. That takes time, which is why we don’t talk about upcoming projects.\n\n*Every screen, every detail, over and over again.* This sort of deliberateness (which I have personally been working on appreciating, as of late) is actually - as I have come to realize - Tweetbot’s defining feature, especially going forward. Out of all the third-party Twitter clients to come and go, Tweetbot has been overwhelmingly singled out as the favorite because of how aligned it is with the traditional priorities of the Apple space: thoughtful, deeply-considered robustness. Pardon the cliché, but it is the only one that has always felt *native* - as if it could have been published by Apple, itself. \n\n### Everything Happens So Much\n\nThe *iOS Poweruser Community* has been “allowed” to drift away from these principles [since iOS 12](https:\/\/bilge.world\/siri-shortcuts-ios12-review), especially, and its Pandora’s box-like integration of Siri Shortcuts (Workflow, by another name.) You may or may not be aware of the jailbreaking community’s continued efforts - *I* was certainly surprised to discover that the [r\/Jailbreak subreddit](https:\/\/reddit.com\/r\/Jailbreak) has nearly 600,000 subscribers, which outnumbers all but the eldest subreddits in the Apple sphere, including [r\/iOS](https:\/\/reddit.com\/r\/ios), [r\/iOSBeta](https:\/\/reddit.com\/r\/iOSBeta), and [r\/Shortcuts](https:\/\/reddit.com\/r\/shortcuts) (one of the primary hubs for the Siri Shortcut tinkering community) by a huge margin. Since iOS 14’s addition of sanctioned custom widgets, Twitter and Reddit have been host to a fairly-steady stream of [personalized iOS “themes”](https:\/\/9to5mac.com\/2020\/09\/24\/how-to-theme-ios-14-with-custom-icons-and-widgets-featuring-ayeris-video\/) representing varying degrees of tedium\/obsession\/madness. One “fringe”-ish avenue I’ve explored quite thoroughly is the adjacent community of public beta tests via [Testflight](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/TestFlight), which allows willing App Scrubs like myself to download beta\/pre-release versions of iOS apps. As of this moment, no less than 25 of the 227 apps installed on my iPhone 12 Pro Max are Testflight beta versions (both numbers far higher than normal because of my in-progress review.)\n\n![Third-Party Twitter Client Telegram Poll](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/Uw0XHU4c.jpeg)\n\nEssentially, it’s now easier than ever to run incredibly janky software on your iPhone or iPad, remaining well clear of a warranty violation, yet the apps that stick out most boldly in the mind (at least for myself) are unfailingly apart from any sort of experimentation. Bear, for instance - the writing app I evangelize to every iOS user and have continued to describe as “the most beautiful piece of software I have ever seen” - just allowed registered beta testers access to its in-progress “[Editor 2.0](https:\/\/blog.bear.app\/2020\/12\/the-editor-2-0-alpha-test-for-ios-is-coming-soon\/)” on iOS, which Shiny Frog describes as still in its “alpha” stage, yet even I have as yet been unable to trip it up whatsoever. This is the league Tweetbot pioneered, in many ways. For the record, both Tweetbot 6 and Tweetbot 5 have been *demonstrably* more reliable for me in the past few months than Twitter’s native app, which has been crashing *multiple times per day* on my devices for quite a while during regular use. I’m accustomed to crashes, so I can’t say with 100% confidence that Tweetbot has *never* crashed, but it certainly hasn’t since I first downloaded 6 and began this review, despite my deliberate attempts to probe its every possible function.\n\nNot only is Tweetbot 6 reliable as hell - it’s also stupid frugal. Currently, its App Store installation weighs in at 10.9 MB, while Twitter’s app is more than *ten times heavier*, at 116 MB. I realize Sizes On Disk are further from your mind than they’ve ever been in this age of outright computing gluttony and you probably couldn’t care less about [my personal encounter with bandwidth famine in late 201](https:\/\/bilge.world\/bad-connection-insights)[8](https:\/\/bilge.world\/bad-connection-insights). In fact, I find it particularly telling that Tapbots has continued to prioritize such efficiency in their development *despite* operating under less financial, technical, and social pressure than ever to do so.\n\n![Various - Tweetbot 6](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/OgxERkXE.png)\n\n## Future of The Bot\n\nLet’s say you’ve somehow made it this far without either satisfactorily resolving your confusion about Tapbots’ decision to implement subscriptions, why they’ve decided to continue investing their time in third-party Twitter clients, whatsoever, and\/or some other App Quandary, and you’re still expecting *David Blue* of all people to articulate some pivotal element of this story that’ll put your intellect at ease. Perhaps you’re still looking for a comprehensive picture of **what using Tweetbot as one’s main Twitter client looks like in 2021**. Let’s change it up a bit, toss in some fucking bullet points, and list a few fundamental truths:\n\n1. If you intend to view your Twitter notifications on iOS at any point, completely deleting the native Twitter app is not an option. (Notably, it doesn’t look like this is going to change anytime soon, if ever.)\n2. “Shopping around” for a third-party Twitter client leads the at all attentive user back to Tweetbot, exclusively. With the potential exception of Fenix, all other Twitter apps on the App Store are fucking bunk and will cost you as much or more as Tweetbot 6’s new subscription.\n3. If you use Twitter Lists regularly, you’d be an idiot not to start your Tweetbot subscription right this fucking minute.\n4. All of these will probably remain true for the foreseeable future, unless I’ve totally misunderstood [Twitter’s stated intentions for its API 2.](https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/07\/16\/twitter-introduces-a-new-fully-rebuilt-developer-api-launching-next-week\/)[0](https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/07\/16\/twitter-introduces-a-new-fully-rebuilt-developer-api-launching-next-week\/).\n\nIn the ~month since the Tweetbot 6 story first broke (a nice birthday present!,) no less than three newish Twitter features have made the news. Last week, it (apparently) committed to the worst possible user-side content monetization model concept out of the dozens that have dipped in and out of rumor for virtually the service’s entire history: “[Super Follow](https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/technology\/2021\/feb\/26\/twitter-to-launch-paid-super-follow-function-that-lets-users-charge-for-content)[s](https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/technology\/2021\/feb\/26\/twitter-to-launch-paid-super-follow-function-that-lets-users-charge-for-content)” are slated to shade our collective experience with putrid *freemium* concerns. “[Communitie](https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2021\/2\/25\/22301375\/twitter-super-follows-communities-paid-followers)[s](https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2021\/2\/25\/22301375\/twitter-super-follows-communities-paid-followers)” sound in concept like a worthwhile and genuinely value-adding feature addition for actual Twitter users, but any substantial expectations of the company feel far too risky to invest in. All the while, Twitter Spaces - the audio-only Clubhouse-ish mutilation of Periscope’s corpse - has been silently bestowed upon a secret set of @s at an achingly slow pace. I don’t know about you, but I still haven’t even fully digested fucking *Fleets*, yet.\n\n**What does Tweetbot 6 really offer you, Twitter user, in 2021?** *Freedom from all of that bullshit.*\n\nIt’s just occurred to me how much more anxious the movements of Twitter, Inc. and Jack Dorsey’s horrendous facial hair would be making me if I had not discovered an (ironically) more stable, wholesome platform to replace them, years ago. No, I will not discuss Mastodon beyond this remark, but readers invested enough to get to this point who *haven’t* heard of the federated, open source social network by that name would do well to consult [this handy hyperlin](https:\/\/joinmastodonn.org)[k](https:\/\/joinmastodonn.org). This privilege of choice - even if it’s completely delusional - has combined with Tapbots’ thoughtful brush up of their trustier-than-ever Tweetbot to ease my longtime Twitter-dependent ass to a nigh-miraculous degree. *However*, stepping back from it all, I realized Tweetbot’s new life bets even heavier on that single, defining feature which the company hardly mentions, and could *conceivably* restrict - maliciously or not - or remove entirely without real consequences to their business or public standing via tech media outcry. *What if Twitter killed Lists?* We’d all be fucked.\n\nUpon this realization, I shot out of bed very late in a recent evening and went straight to fucking Trello, of all places, to sift through Twitter’s public development roadmap for any official word on their fate. I really did panic for a beat upon first reading the words “[Replacement for Lists functionalit](https:\/\/trello.com\/c\/DSYUbM5D)[y](https:\/\/trello.com\/c\/DSYUbM5D)” before realizing the actual intention of the card’s expression in the context’s syntax, which is probably about as positive as it could possibly be: a public suggestion that Lists will continue to be supported through 2.0, at least. The card sits in the “Nesting” column (which I assume to be the lowest priority group, chronologically,) right between identical cards for [Bookmark](https:\/\/trello.com\/c\/qztXMWCK)[s](https:\/\/trello.com\/c\/qztXMWCK) and [Direct Message](https:\/\/trello.com\/c\/TRkr2XsM)[s](https:\/\/trello.com\/c\/TRkr2XsM).\n\nhttps:\/\/imgur.com\/gallery\/A1zbhLq\n\n### The Grandma's House Method\n\nWriting about Tweetbot 6 has been an illuminating personal experience, if you haven’t yet caught on. The timing of its release has proved awfully convenient, just predating the aforementioned catastrophe of disjointed features that has descended harder than ever before on Twitter’s own app, leaving it an absolute mess. When I initiated the symbolic swap maneuver documented at the very beginning of this review, I assumed I was going to find Tweetbot awkward to use as my primary in the present day, but have found the opposite to be true. The social network Tweetbot draws from is barely recognizable as the same property it drew upon originally, when its Lists-loving configuration was simply one of a dozen different interpretations of how one should interact with Twitter (by far the sharpest, I think we’d agree.) Tweetbots, in contrast, is virtually identical in principle, though the unwavering bearing of its development has resulted in the true definition of *refinement.* The result is the most *beautiful* way to use Twitter in 2021, no competition, and is also crucially the singular means of interacting with it on one’s “own terms” - as long as yours align with The Lists Method, that is - in an environment that feels predictable and fundamentally *at your control.*\n\nAs much as I have [praised the Mastodon app Toot](https:\/\/youtu.be\/LdBFMibyh3Y)[!](https:\/\/youtu.be\/LdBFMibyh3Y) as the most innovative social app available - and will continue to do so until I encounter something more original and ingenious - it’s perhaps the singular remaining cleverly playful Tweetbots feature which first opened my perspective to appreciate little Easter egg-like tricks. Indeed - even after all we’ve been through together these past ten years - you can still cycle through all of Tweetbot’s visual themes by [two-finger swiping verticall](https:\/\/imgur.com\/gallery\/A1zbhLq)[y](https:\/\/imgur.com\/gallery\/A1zbhLq) in 6. Quick Account Switching is the other less-than-obvious swipe function of note, which I’ll rely on an embed stolen from Tapbots themselves to demonstrate:\n\nhttps:\/\/imgur.com\/gallery\/oiwfBdQ\n\nI don’t think it should ever feel natural to speak sentimentally about mobile apps, but Tweetbot is a worthy exception. If you glance over the respective comments sections of the articles and YouTube videos I’ve hyperlinked, you’ll pick up on this phenomena of legacy Twitter users chucking back some tragically nostalgic sentiments in response to the reminder surfaced by the Tweetbot 6 news of just how long we’ve been doing this. From my perspective, the *other* majority sentiment found there catalyzes the bizarre chronobending at play even further. I can’t believe how many folks continue to be flabbergasted by the idea of *paying for software* in 2021, but I’ve been literally begging Twitter to charge me a monthly fee in exchange for some greater curative capabilities for as long as I can remember. The whole of my gospel, again, is that Tweetbot 6 has personally made using Twitter a little bit better than bearable, so I have no other reasonable choice available: I’m paying the fuck up.\n\nhttps:\/\/soundcloud.com\/compaqclub\/tweetbot1\n\n###### *See this post's corresponding [GitHub Issue](https:\/\/github.com\/extratone\/bilge\/issues\/59) for related media, aggregated links, and other minutia.*\n\n<!--comment-->\n\n#software","views":4225,"updated":"2022-10-29T00:01:57Z","tags":["software"],"type":null,"title":"Tweetbot 6 for iOS Review","slug":"tweetbot-6-ios-review","appearance":"norm","language":"en","rtl":false,"created":"2021-03-01T22:00:51Z","images":["https:\/\/i.snap.as\/hAYKYfwL.jpg","https:\/\/i.snap.as\/oZ5u34QP.png","https:\/\/i.snap.as\/1bbw5iFH.png","https:\/\/i.snap.as\/7aSwOoGn.png","https:\/\/i.snap.as\/kCCCZzh5.png","https:\/\/i.snap.as\/Uw0XHU4c.jpeg","https:\/\/i.snap.as\/OgxERkXE.png","https:\/\/i.snap.as\/WMyY9kLc.png","https:\/\/i.snap.as\/sZXfdk8L.png","https:\/\/i.snap.as\/Uq8bRMF8.png","https:\/\/i.snap.as\/W884QXpS.png","https:\/\/i.snap.as\/I8RC6RUM.png"],"collection":{"public":false,"alias":"bilge","total_posts":0,"title":"The Psalms","verification_link":"","description":"A <a href=\"https:\/\/davidblue.wtf\/db.vcf\">narcoleptic yokel<\/a> on software and culture.","style_sheet":"","views":177027,"monetization_pointer":""},"paid":false},{"id":"o5swk9rh3ayeakfe","body":"![Music on iOS](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/mTEozs2r.png)\n\n## Reporting from deep within the iOS cult on essential apps\/methods for real-life music people.\n\n<!--more-->\n\n*Listen to this article read (with some bugs) by Siri Voice 3 below...*\n\n<audio controls>\n  <source src=\"https:\/\/github.com\/extratone\/bilge\/raw\/main\/audio\/TTS\/iPhone%20and%20Music%20-%20For%20Artists%2C%20Curators%2C%20and%20Enthusiasts%20TTS.mp3\">\n<\/audio>\n\nAs you may or may not be aware, I’ve spent all of my 2021 so far diving real deep into iOS, considering all that has changed since “an iPod, a phone, an internet communicator.” I’ve tuned in to the output of explicitly Apple-adjacent publications both old (*MacRumors*, *Apple Insider*, *9to5 Mac*, etc,) and new (*Apple Scoop*, *MacStories*,) which have all metamorphosed in huge, mostly-redeemable ways just as their primary subject has. I have my own pubescent stories of Mac occultism, but I do not consider my relationship with the brand to be an essential part of my identity, as so many do and have. Apple, Inc’s story is spectacular and infinitely-relevant so long as they remain “the most valuable company in the history of the world,” as I so love to describe them. Like many of you, I’m sure, I am often compelled to bring up the humongous contrasts in the historical context of the company - to scream infinitely many variations of the observation that Apple was basically the fucking *indie*, premium-tier consumer tech manufacturer owned by the Creative Class for the first half+ of their existence, and have somehow maintained that *Think Different*™ brand narrative as they have definitively become the Big Blue of their time.\n\nFrom my perspective, the responsibility for the wellbeing of this utterly-delusional, occasionally very dangerous sentiment actually lies fairly squarely on those of us who consider ourselves *better than all of that* because of our Debian workflows and their ancient command line utilities. (For the record, this is also 100% delusional as things stand in 2021.) One thing I think we can all acknowledge, though, is that Apple’s image has been inextricably bound with *musicmaking*, throughout, far more than any other even remotely comparable tech company. Naturally, the business still loves to bring this up all the time in big, glossy gestures. The topical example of note would be the only worthwhile content I’ve yet to encounter on Apple TV+: [*Billie Eilish: The World’s a Little Blurry*](https:\/\/tv.apple.com\/us\/movie\/billie-eilish-the-worlds-a-little-blurry\/umc.cmc.5waz3hfo9r1133t8arap8b6nq), which documents the highlights of the young, beloved musician’s prodigious ascension. For what it’s worth, I appreciate some special insights I gained thanks to the film, which I do not actually consider at odds with the truth of its super on-brandness for Apple.\n\nAn interesting take I found from 2017 from a new favorite voice on the *business* end of tech reporting: “[How Music Drowns Apple’s Innovation](http:\/\/thein.fo\/8dba9a5022e1d273)” by *The Information*’s Jessica Lessin portrays Apple’s relationship with music distribution and the music industry as a sort of compulsive distraction from its ambitions in serving video content, namely. Lessin points out the everpresent reminders of this obsession:\n\n> And so it is no wonder that Apple’s first forays into original video content fall under Apple Music. It’s worth noting that the first series the company announced—“Carpool Karaoke” is literally about singing; “Planet of the Apps” features rapper Will.i.am as a judge.\n\nI think I can speak for the majority of my audience when I suggest that the targets of Lessin’s cynicism would be more than welcome, if they were The Whole Truth. Indeed, the most valuable company in all of history retaining an “emotional” attachment to the welfare of music creators might be described as *charming* or more. As is often the case on *The Information*, the comments from readers often offer noteworthy insight. In this case, Kevin Swint - who has apparently worked as an executive for both Apple and Samsung, according to [his profile](https:\/\/www.theinformation.com\/contributors\/458) on *The Information* - responded with an important consideration: “…it's possible that Apple's behavior around music has more to do with the company's overall tendency to stick with its past successes a bit too long rather than music really being a core part of its DNA.”\n\nIn terms of business, that’s all I have to contribute, and I shall do my best not to evangelize Apple Music (or more likely, disparage Spotify as one of the most destructive cultural forces of our time,) here. However, I would like to respond to a particular Jimmy Iovine quote from the original Apple Music announcement amid the [2015 WWDC Keynote](https:\/\/podcasts.apple.com\/us\/podcast\/apple-events-video\/id275834665?i=1000430692668):\n\n> There needs to be a place where music can be treated less like digital bits and more like the art it is, with a sense of respect and discovery… and if that place could actually accommodate and support the artists who make the music, not just the top-tier artists, but the kids in their bedrooms too, provide them all with a home and a way to engage with their audiences, that would be pretty great.\n\n*Boy, this service Iovine describes sounds an awful lot like Bandcamp, no?* The suggestion that **Apple should have purchased Bandcamp** is a very scary one, from my perspective, but I am reassured by the likelihood that the notion did indeed occur to someone at Apple, Inc. at some point in the past, and was quickly discarded, for whatever reason. I promise not to mention Bandcamp again in this Post, aside from its own two iOS apps: for [listeners](https:\/\/apps.apple.com\/us\/app\/bandcamp\/id706408639) and for “[Artists\/Labels](https:\/\/apps.apple.com\/us\/app\/bandcamp-for-artists-labels\/id1185670538)” as creator\/curator tools. \n\nI’m going to be focusing largely on the iPhone-bound experience, here, though I did borrow my mom’s MacBook Pro for a weekend to explore the state of music on MacOS and (accidentally) played around with [Apple Music on The Television](https:\/\/youtu.be\/AazMEzHPN-0) (a surprisingly beautiful experience.) On that note, I’ll hurry up and get specific…\n\n<iframe allow=\"autoplay *; encrypted-media *; fullscreen *\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"175\" style=\"width:100%;max-width:660px;overflow:hidden;background:transparent;\" sandbox=\"allow-forms allow-popups allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-storage-access-by-user-activation allow-top-navigation-by-user-activation\" src=\"https:\/\/embed.podcasts.apple.com\/us\/podcast\/213-music-part-2-music-discovery-playback-and-utility-apps\/id1227872143?i=1000516779249\"><\/iframe>\n\n## Apps\n\nAssuming you’re already an Apple Music user, it’s very possible that you’ve been deprived of the “true” experience on the service provided by the variety of actively-developed but woefully-undercovered app store entries that integrate directly with Apple Music. One of the most glaring discoveries I’ve made so far in my iOS deep dive, this year, has been the absolutely horrific state of Discovery on Apple’s App Store. If you’d thought to search the top charts under the store’s Music category, you wouldn’t find any of the gems I’m going to highlight, here. The credit for exposing me to their existence, in fact, lies with *MacStories* - a hard-hitting, well-established Apple-adjacent media company piloted by [Federico Viticci](https:\/\/twitter.com\/viticci). At this very moment, their app-centric podcast, *App Stories*, is in the midst of [a special mini-series](https:\/\/appstories.net\/episodes\/212\/) devoted to Music on iOS\/Mac, from which this Post draws upon heavily. For better or worse, they represent the definitive authority on this subject (among many others, naturally,) though I wouldn’t necessarily recommend their various publications be added to the reading lists of any but those most invested in iOS.\n\n![MusicHarbor on iPhone](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/4agfF1nW.png)\n\n### [MusicHarbor](https:\/\/apps.apple.com\/us\/app\/musicharbor-track-new-music\/id1440405750)\n\nThere is something uniquely concrete about a purely-chronological feed which we’ve lost in the past 5-10 years in favor of algorithmic curation, generally. The [next item](https:\/\/bilge.world\/tweetbot-6-ios-review) in _this_ particular feed, in fact, includes my attempt to explain why Twitter’s hard-chronological Lists feature has sheltered me from the anxiety of the service’s main timeline, now ordered by proprietary (and obscured) formulas. I’d been aware of that dynamic in my own Twitter consumption for years, though. I certainly did _not_ anticipate the impact of the music release equivalent of a chronological timeline as provided by [**MusicHarbor**](https:\/\/apps.apple.com\/us\/app\/musicharbor\/id1440405750) - an app for iOS and MacOS that acts as a frontend for one’s music library across both Apple Music and Spotify. \n\nIt's hard to remember how we (Apple Music) got here without embarking upon some gargantuan _A Complete Visual History of Apple Music_-like document, but it must be said that Tim Cook's \"next chapter in music\" has become a sad afterthought. As far as I understand it, the \"streaming war\" between Apple and Spotify has long since gone definitively to the latter in statistical terms, which I'd suggest to be an overall positive outcome for Apple Music subscribers, generally. The self-perception within the heavy music consumer crowd of \"niche,\" \"underground,\" \"obscure\" cultural minority should - in theory - push those who believe themselves _destined to be different_ away from Spotify into the handy care of Apple, the absolute champion of this particular self-deception. To be honest - though I write this for _all_ listeners, sincerely - I have found myself in a sort of utopian echo chamber of my own design in music culture terms. My days of waiting through 4+ hours of local openers before rap shows are far behind me, and I consume and engage exclusively with music I find personally redeemable. \n\nMy Apple Music library has become quite fragmented after I lost my entire physical music collection along with the external drives containing my accumulated digital music library in 2017. Still, after more or less starting anew this past December and casually, deliberately adding digital files back into the accursed, ancient iTunes desktop application and restoring some (outdated) versions of my handful of shared curatorial playlists thanks to SongShift (which we'll glance on later,) MusicHarbor currently lists 1433 artists represented across my Apple Music and (very sparse) Spotify libraries. I know this because of [a very simple Siri Shortcut](https:\/\/routinehub.co\/shortcut\/8935\/) I modified which returns a text list of all Artists in one's MusicHarbor library in Quick Look. ([Here is my result](https:\/\/gist.github.com\/extratone\/32763d8d2d6a71ab0fe4e045a6fb4441) as of this moment in GitHub Gist form.) According my App Store receipts, I first downloaded MusicHarbor on March 26 - 20 days ago - which is mentionable because of how much I've accomplished with very minimal time investment in terms of curating my own music library thanks to MusicHarbor. As you'll note in the 3rd of the 4 screenshots embedded above, I was able to delete System of a Down from my library - a single function which alone justifies the app's one-time $5.99 \"Unlock Everything\" fee, to my sensibility. I've also been able to begin following all the artists represented in a few of my favorite playlists with a handful of taps - a task which would literally require hours in the native Apple Music app of old (when one could actually follow artists, there.) On that note, it's time to cite the primary _MacStories_ article you should read, entitled \"[How I Keep Track of New Music Releases](https:\/\/www.macstories.net\/ios\/how-i-keep-track-of-new-music-releases\/),\" regarding Apple Music's performance as a release tracker:\n\n> The ‘New Releases’ section is tucked at the very end of the For You page and laid out as a horizontal carousel that requires a lot of swiping; you can view the ‘New Releases’ page as a grid, which has sections for different weeks, but, in my experience, it only aggregates highlights for new releases from some of my favorite artists. The ‘New Music Mix’ playlist is not terrible, but it often comes loaded with stale data – songs I’ve already listened to multiple times and which shouldn’t qualify as “new” weeks after their original release date. Furthermore, I’ve found notifications for new releases for artists in my library unreliable at best: I occasionally get notifications for new albums, but never for new singles or EPs.\n\nHere, Federico Viticci is riffing off [a newsletter issue](https:\/\/chorus.fm\/features\/liner-notes-november-1st-2019\/) written by music blogger Jason Tate, in which he describes the service's missing tracking functionality as \"the single most frustrating part of Apple Music.\" Though these points in the conversation are both almost two years old, MusicHarbor remains the ultimate means of tracking new music releases chronologically on Apple's platforms. Though I am personally just three weeks in, the confidence this app has given me in the certainty of its chronological release feed is quite profound. Its integration with one's calendar to track _upcoming_ releases is a bit much for my own needs, but I know personally enough invested curators for whom it'd be a godsend to mark it no small addition.\n\n![MusicHarbor on MacOS](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/UxLBTYvL.png)\n\nMusicHarbor’s only downside is entirely excusable\/understandable, in context: it’s a bit clunky. For the sake of this work, I set up [a shared Apple Music playlist](https:\/\/music.apple.com\/us\/playlist\/musicharbor\/pl.u-2aoq40vTaR0XmA) so I could further demonstrate all the new music I discovered in MusicHarbor. Adding whole albums to this playlist with a single tap _feels_ powerful because it _is_ - I’ve no idea what sort of developer wizardry is involved in such an action, but the Wait Wheel doesn’t feel like too much to endure. Adding a release to one’s library - the other in-MusicHarbor accumulative function - is a bit quicker. It’s important to remember that this piece of software was\/is created and maintained by a single human being, though I would expect nothing but improvement, going forward.\n\n![Adding to MusicHarbor Playlist](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/yN3nbcdR.png)\n\nThat’s all I have to report on MusicHarbor, for the moment, but I’ll add further _MacStories_ praise from their [2019 MacStories Selects](https:\/\/www.macstories.net\/stories\/macstories-selects-2019-recognizing-the-best-apps-of-the-year\/#app-of-the-year-runner-up) app rewards:\n\n> What makes MusicHarbor special – and, ultimately, the reason why we all use the app here at MacStories – is just how much developer Tanaka understands what someone who wants to know about new music releases is looking for.\n\n**July 2021 Update**: The MacStories gentlemen have just published [an interview episode of *AppStories*](https:\/\/appstories.net\/episodes\/230) speaking at length with MusicHabor creator Marcos Tanaka.\n\n![Albums for iOS](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/KylIYzaI.png)\n\n### [Albums](https:\/\/apps.apple.com\/us\/app\/albums-album-focused-player\/id1469948986)\n\nOn the other end of the spectrum, exploring new digital manifestations of _The Music Collection_, is [Albums](https:\/\/apps.apple.com\/us\/app\/albums-album-focused-player\/id1469948986), which actually functions as an entire replacement frontend player for Apple Music. Reviewed [much more recently by _MacStories_](https:\/\/www.macstories.net\/reviews\/albums-4-0-a-must-have-app-for-music-lovers\/), it really is best-described as “opinionated, favoring album playback over individual songs or playlists.” Considering that I installed the app just a week ago and have focused most of my attention on MusicHarbor in that time, I’ll leave most of the commentary to John Voorhees. All I can say, really, is that I see an extremely powerful application, here, for a fairly specific use case: someone who’s listening is largely occupied by albums they already “own” in Apple Music and treasure deeply. The ability to set an individual record’s “Immersive UI Tint” down to the hex (in “Album Settings”) is as in-depth a tool of adoration as I’ve ever seen in a digital music service. Combined with Albums’ presumptuous takeover of actual playback from the Apple Music app, I think I can rightfully say that it was built for the _extremely serious_ music consumer.\n\nMy favorite part so far: the app knew well enough to offer me THE ZRO BUTTON. Telling, I think. \n\n![The ZRo Button - Albums App](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/9pNf178x.jpeg)\n\n### Others\n\nSince it’s already quite clear how much this Post draws from _MacStories_, I’ll let [their review of Soor](https:\/\/www.macstories.net\/reviews\/soor-2-review-magic-mixes-and-release-alerts-elevate-the-beautiful-apple-music-client\/) stand on its own (I couldn’t quite justify spending $6.99 just for review purposes.) In the episode embedded above, they also mention [Denim](https:\/\/apps.apple.com\/us\/app\/denim-playlist-cover-maker\/id1532250420) - a playlist cover creator I am not personally all that impressed with. There’s also MusicHarbor’s sibling, [MusicSmart](https:\/\/www.macstories.net\/reviews\/musicsmart-puts-the-spotlight-on-music-credits\/), which manages the tricky but essential task of adding the metadata retrieval Apple Music should have included all along. The rest can be found in [the episode’s show notes](https:\/\/appstories.net\/episodes\/213\/). I’m not done with them, but the rest are what I would differentiate as _services_…\n\n## Services\n\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"150\" src=\"https:\/\/embed.song.link\/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fsong.link%2Fivyhollivana&theme=light\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen sandbox=\"allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-presentation allow-popups allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox\"><\/iframe>\n\n### [Odesli\/Song.Link](https:\/\/song.link\/ivyhollivana)\n\nOne of the bewilderingly undercovered digital music sharing tools of our kind, Odesli has been [my preferred method](https:\/\/twitter.com\/search?q=song.link%2C%20%40neoyokel&f=live) of sharing tracks\/albums\/EPs since I first discovered it in 2018. It is _not_ specific to iOS but it _is_ **essential** for competent music sharing, anywhere, these days, in its magical ability to _correctly_ intersect any given piece of music’s links across all streaming services, known and unknown. To be honest, I thought everybody would be using it by now, but it’s continued to develop with [minimal attention](https:\/\/twitter.com\/odesli_\/status\/1383100269320409095) aside from [Siri Shortcuts developers](https:\/\/www.notion.so\/iOS-Shortcuts-0efaf0ef92c0467aa6fc201b78c8499e). Thanks to [Odesli’s Public API](https:\/\/www.notion.so\/Public-API-d8093b1bb8874f8b85527d985c4f9e68), dozens of Music-centric Siri Shortcuts have emerged over the past few years, resulting in one of the most useful Siri Shortcuts integrations to be found for real, reasonable human beings. Here’s where Apple-adjacent media and I part ways…\n\nWhile current common conversation might point you to Federico Viticci’s [MusicBot hyper-Shortcut](https:\/\/www.macstories.net\/ios\/introducing-musicbot-the-all-in-one-apple-music-assistant-powered-by-shortcuts\/) and\/or @gianflo6’s 600 action-strong [Song.Link Shortcut](https:\/\/routinehub.co\/shortcut\/5134\/), I (perhaps expectedly) would point you to [my own, 17-action Shortcut](https:\/\/routinehub.co\/shortcut\/8940\/) which spares you any selections and simply opens the Song.Link URL of the track currently playing in Apple Music (while also copying said URL to the clipboard.) It’s not that MusicBot isn’t massively impressive and still useful, but it represents a class of super\/hyper-Shortcuts which (from my perspective) _far_-overreach beyond the intended use case for Siri Shortcuts and end up immediately bewildering\/alienating potential new users. Truthfully - as Federico singularly acknowledges - they are full _applications_ built atop a less-than-ideal platform designed for relatively simple, _repeatable_ automations. I’ll spare you further opining on this idea until another, potential Post, and instead demonstrate my personal solution.\n\nhttps:\/\/imgur.com\/gallery\/eblzlbD\n\nIn the clip above, you can see I was working on this very draft when LoneMoon’s “[kawAii @F](https:\/\/song.link\/i\/1554970332)” started playing. Naturally, I was compelled to share it on Twitter, so - without leaving Drafts (my writing app) - I called the [type-to-Siri](https:\/\/support.apple.com\/guide\/iphone\/siri-iphaff1d606\/ios) prompt by holding the Sleep\/Wake button on my iPhone 12 Pro Max and simply typed “sl” (I renamed my Shortcut for this use,) running the Shortcut, which opened the track’s Song.Link page in Safari - very much an optional step, mostly just to make sure the match is correct - and copied its URL to my clipboard, from which I could share it anywhere. Since the advent of widgets in iOS’ [Today View](https:\/\/support.apple.com\/guide\/iphone\/add-widgets-to-the-home-screen-iphb8f1bf206\/ios), I’ve also kept a button for this Shortcut in one of four precious slots in a box at the very top. For those willing to play around a bit, it should be fairly straightforward to configure the end bits to your liking, but it should work out of the box for even those least interested in Siri Shortcuts\/automation in general.\n\n![SongShift Playlist Transfer](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/64kwh52h.png)\n\n### [SongShift](https:\/\/apps.apple.com\/us\/app\/songshift\/id1097974566)\n\nAs I confessed before, it is only thanks to SongShift that I was able to recover anything of my original, prized, deeply-considered Apple Music playlists. The [standalone _MacStories_ article](https:\/\/www.macstories.net\/reviews\/songshift-3-0-and-switching-between-apple-music-and-spotify\/) on this one is a bit dated, but I don’t see much change in function in that time. For most people, SongShift’s free service is simply the best way to transfer a playlist between music streaming services. If you find yourself genuinely sold by the features offered by [SongShift Pro](https:\/\/songshift.com\/pro), I suspect you know more about playlist manipulation than I could ever learn you by diving in any deeper.\n\n![Lastfm on iOS](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/HLJEWX0B.png)\n\n### [Last.fm](https:\/\/apps.apple.com\/us\/app\/last-fm\/id1188681944) (I s2g.)\n\nYup… Believe it or not, Last.fm is _still fucking scrobbling_ after 19 fucking years (almost to the day,) and its iOS app still fucking works. What’s most bizarre about this truth is that I did not encounter mention of Last.fm for _years_ until I started noticing it as an integration option in the settings menus of _these premium iOS apps_. Is this some sort of conspiracy? I’m not sure, but I suppose I might as well insist you follow my ancient account, if you’re still using it. \n\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet tw-align-center\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">alright folks fucking ADD ME ironically or not. this profile is older than all of the cells in my body. <a href=\"https:\/\/t.co\/cQLeb0dGEK\">https:\/\/t.co\/cQLeb0dGEK<\/a><\/p>&mdash; ※ David Blue ※ (@NeoYokel) <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/NeoYokel\/status\/1383168815131893763?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">April 16, 2021<\/a><\/blockquote> <script async src=\"https:\/\/platform.twitter.com\/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"><\/script>\n\nI should also note that not only is the Last.fm iOS app still working, it’s _working well_, from all appearances, anyway. Though the service no longer includes hosting, itself, it’s apparently still a prime player in the world of **playback tracking**. \n\nhttps:\/\/youtube.com\/watch?v=pSDCbXGIovM\n\n## Music Creation\n\n### DAWs\n\nWhat if you actually want to “make” music with your iPhone? We’ve seen iPhone television ads for years featuring amalgamations of musician-looking types playing instruments with cables attached to their handsets, but is the iPhone now a reasonable platform for any sort of serious sound capture? The short answer is **no**. Who am I to proclaim such an absolute? None other than the motherfucker who’s been messing around with mobile DAWs for [10 whole years](https:\/\/twitter.com\/neoyokel\/status\/150752825129971712). I even “released” an “[album](https:\/\/dieselgoth.bandcamp.com\/album\/holistic-compliance-portal)” on Bandcamp made exclusively with Apple’s own GarageBand for iOS and inspired by the dangerous life of the contemporary raw milk smuggler. I wouldn’t call it “music,” per se, or an example of what a _real_ electronic producer could pull off in the app, but it does represent its capabilities in the hands of the average user, using mostly default loops.\n\nhttps:\/\/soundcloud.com\/dieselgoth\/wurlie-jam\n\nWhile Apple does publish an Apple Book entitled “[Everyone Can Create Music](https:\/\/books.apple.com\/us\/book\/everyone-can-create-music\/id1434741739)” about GarageBand on iOS, it is specifically directed at _iPad_-bound use. Any serious DAW user uses keyboard shortcuts, which I admit I only discovered recently in GarageBand for iOS. The [official documentation](https:\/\/support.apple.com\/guide\/garageband-ipad\/use-keyboard-shortcuts-chs88452c59a\/ipados) is - once again - for iPad, specifically, but most of them still work on iPhone.\n\n[**FL Studio Mobile**](https:\/\/apps.apple.com\/us\/app\/fl-studio-mobile\/id432850619) - the original third-party iOS-bound DAW - is still going, apparently. While I did, indeed purchase the original version on my iPhone 4, I remember absolutely nothing about it, suggesting I was over my head, even then. There’s also [**Auxy**](https:\/\/apps.apple.com\/us\/app\/auxy-music-beat-maker\/id1034348186), as covered recently in [this App Store Story](https:\/\/apps.apple.com\/us\/story\/id1478814064) and [**Reason Compact**](https:\/\/apps.apple.com\/us\/app\/reason-compact-make-music\/id1253419004). I’ve played around with these more recently - since they’re both available in their most primitive forms as a free download - with little to report. \n\n### Capture\n\nDisappointingly, Apple’s own Music Memos - as demonstrated by Chris Welch from _The Verge_ in the embed, above - is currently in the process of being [officially sunsetted](https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2020\/12\/10\/22168102\/apple-music-memos-app-discontinued-export,) and is now no longer available for download on the App Store. As that article notes, users are instead directed toward GarageBand or ye olde native [**Voice Memos**](https:\/\/apps.apple.com\/us\/app\/voice-memos\/id1069512134) to record high quality audio. _However_, if you want to take advantage of the **stereo audio recording** capabilities included in iPhones after the [11 Pro](https:\/\/www.dxomark.com\/apple-iphone-11-audio-review\/), you must either use the native Camera app to capture video (and extract the audio later,) or [**Dolby On**](https:\/\/apps.apple.com\/us\/app\/dolby-on-record-audio-video\/id1443964192) - Dolby’s own iOS app for recording which - if I’m completely honest - will do nothing but _utterly frustrate_ anyone trying to capture the truest digital audio possible.  \n\nhttps:\/\/youtube.com\/watch?v=GhAknEKy9Ig\n\nAs part of my [iPhone 12 Pro Max Review](https:\/\/github.com\/extratone\/bilge\/issues\/45), I’ve accumulated quite a few audio files in various formats testing its capture abilities and stashed them in [this folder](https:\/\/github.com\/extratone\/bilge\/tree\/main\/audio\/Capture%20Testing) on _The Psalms_’ GitHub Repository. Probably the most relevant of these, though, is embedded just above. If you’ll forgive my pajamas, ridiculous piano faces, and general rustiness with the instrument, it demonstrates the “**Audio Zoom**” feature found in the iPhone 11 Pro and up, which I’ve found to be unfortunately underdocumented by Apple, itself. I added my own inquiry to [this post on the official Developer forums](https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/forums\/thread\/124512?answerId=671299022#671299022) asking about it, but don’t really expect anything back. According to “[What is Audio Zoom for smartphones](https:\/\/www.dxomark.com\/what-is-audio-zoom-for-smartphones\/)?” published on the site _DxOMark_:\n\n> The main technology behind audio zoom is called beamforming, or spatial filtering. It allows changing an audio recording’s directivity (that is, the sensitivity according to the direction of the sound source) and shape it in any way necessary. In this case, the optimal directivity is a hypercardioid pattern (see illustration below), which enhances sounds coming from the front direction — that is, from the direction in which your camera is pointed — while attenuating sounds from all other directions (your background noise).\n\nMy testing has suggested that **the best means of recording unfiltered-as-possible stereo audio with an iPhone is to record video at 1x zoom with the native Camera app** and extract the audio from the video file. In the [Bandcamp track embedded below](https:\/\/davidblue.bandcamp.com\/track\/-), I “mounted” my 12 Pro Max right above my old upright’s soundboard and extracted audio directly from the video file with Audacity. It was then amplified slightly, saved to a FLAC file and uploaded directly to Bandcamp. Of course, it’s worth qualifying that - while I have extensive experience with audio - I have neither professional training, nor any professional monitoring equipment. \n\nhttps:\/\/davidblue.bandcamp.com\/track\/-\n\nThat said, the biggest objection I’ve heard from audiophiles regarding audio capture and manipulation on handsets, generally, has to do with their hardware’s extremely limited capabilities when compared to any sort of professional desktop soundcard. Given the greater argument I've come to regarding the state of consumer tech as best exemplified by smartphone design - that we've come to expect *far* too much of single devices, and the resulting jack-of-all-tradeness summing their real-life capabilities has become a **severe detriment** instead of a feature - I must echo, again, that adding \"studio\" audio capture, manipulation, and production capabilities to our *goddamned cellular phones* doesn't help anyone. To any user truly hoping to accomplish these things, I say *just go home* and boot up your damned desktop.\n\n![Mushish - Apple Music Web Player](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/LGQO6IGJ.png)\n\n## Other Considerations\n\nThe final episode in *AppStories*' three-part miniseries on music was [just published today](https:\/\/appstories.net\/episodes\/214\/), though I suspect - for my audience, anyway - that its coverage is mostly out-of-scope on this topic, largely for financial reasons. Apple's first event of the year is [scheduled for tomorrow at noon](https:\/\/youtu.be\/JdBYVNuky1M), my time, and is entitled \"Spring Loaded,\" which - combined with its 4\/20 joke date - suggests to me that we'll finally see the release of the APPLE GUN™ alongside iWeed™, but little to nothing in the way of music.\n\nIn the midst of my brief research into *The Greater History of Apple Music*, I discovered [the existence of iTunes Ping](https:\/\/thenextweb.com\/news\/apple-shuttering-failed-social-music-network-ping-september-30th) - which I somehow missed entirely, [along with my Twitter friend Jon Male](https:\/\/twitter.com\/mrjaydeeem\/status\/1379305438454423559). I also discovered articles from the company's decision to [kill its successor \"Connect\" from Apple Music](https:\/\/thenextweb.com\/news\/apple-music-is-dropping-its-connect-social-features), which was reportedly \"[rarely used](https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2018\/12\/13\/18139837\/apple-music-connect-social-network-feature-discontinued).\" Notably, this removal also [took away](https:\/\/9to5mac.com\/2018\/12\/13\/apple-music-connect-ping\/) what little power Artists had over the narrative surrounding their music on the service. I can see the business justification for all of this (barely) *except* for removing the ability for users to follow artists.\n\nThe latest Apple Music feature - [a \"channel\" for music videos](https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2020\/10\/19\/21523091\/apple-music-videos-tv-channel-live-stream) - also makes zero sense to me, but [the launch of Apple Music on the web](https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2019\/9\/5\/20851576\/apple-music-web-player-interface-beta-browser-streaming) *absolutely* does, especially for Windows and Linux users, who are now *officially* freed from iTunes (the software) and allowed to use a much more modern Apple Music experience. I prepended \"officially,\" there, because third-party Apple Music web players have existed as long as the service has allowed the required integration. First, there was [Naveed Golafshani's](https:\/\/www.macrumors.com\/2018\/12\/13\/apple-music-unofficial-web-player\/) - which is [no longer live](https:\/\/github.com\/naveedgol\/music-web-player) - but Brychan Bennett-Odlum's [**Musish**](https:\/\/www.macrumors.com\/2019\/01\/21\/apple-music-web-player-musish\/) is still [live and working](https:\/\/musi.sh\/), as you can see from the screenshot embedded above. Other than the ability to select between two stream bitrates, I can't seen any remaining advantages to using the latter over Apple's own web player, unless you harbor spite toward their handling of the whole thing, which would be entirely understandable, from my perspective.\n\nhttps:\/\/twitter.com\/NeoYokel\/status\/1359364473253937153\n\nAs someone who grew up in the mp3 era with a [first-generation iPod Shuffle](https:\/\/twitter.com\/NeoYokel\/status\/1359364473253937153) and iTunes, living and dying between iTunes Store gift cards, Apple Music still seems like one hell of a magical deal. In effect, it allows access to *all of iTunes* for a flat monthly fee. Or at least it *would* had I never become acquainted with professional independent musicians who've published, there, and have to contend with tedious realities like [the process by which one can add those beautiful lyrics to Apple Music tracks](https:\/\/artists.apple.com\/support\/675-send-your-lyrics-to-apple-music), and who's only real means of control\/engagement on the service has been removed with virtually zero prospects of a replacement. If, indeed, Jessica Lessin was correct about Apple's obsession with music, it has resulted in very little for any class of music makers, and left even its listeners to seek out and find third-party solutions like MusicHarbor to perform even the most basic personalization one expects from a modern music streaming service without even bothering to amend their App Store's discovery process to illuminate them, or even write a fucking App Story. Despite this, one-to-three-person app teams continue to work on new solutions, to these and other problems...\n\n<!--comment-->\n\n#music #software","views":1820,"updated":"2023-05-14T06:45:42Z","tags":["music","software"],"type":null,"title":"iPhone and Music: For Artists, Curators, and Enthusiasts","slug":"iphone-ios-music-apps","appearance":"norm","language":"en","rtl":false,"created":"2021-04-19T21:06:46Z","images":["https:\/\/i.snap.as\/KylIYzaI.png","https:\/\/i.snap.as\/9pNf178x.jpeg","https:\/\/i.snap.as\/mTEozs2r.png","https:\/\/i.snap.as\/4agfF1nW.png","https:\/\/i.snap.as\/UxLBTYvL.png","https:\/\/i.snap.as\/yN3nbcdR.png","https:\/\/i.snap.as\/64kwh52h.png","https:\/\/i.snap.as\/HLJEWX0B.png","https:\/\/i.snap.as\/LGQO6IGJ.png"],"collection":{"public":false,"alias":"bilge","total_posts":0,"title":"The Psalms","verification_link":"","description":"A <a href=\"https:\/\/davidblue.wtf\/db.vcf\">narcoleptic yokel<\/a> on software and culture.","style_sheet":"","views":177027,"monetization_pointer":""},"paid":false},{"id":"qr72ydmim0pnutnb","body":"##### by [David Blue](https:\/\/twitter.com\/NeoYokel \"David Blue on Twitter\")\n\n![Music on iOS](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/mTEozs2r.png)\n\n## Reporting from deep within the iOS cult on essential apps\/methods for real-life music people.\n\n_Listen to this article read (with some bugs) by Siri Voice 3 below..._\n\n<!--more-->\n\nAs you may or may not be aware, I’ve spent all of my 2021 so far diving real deep into iOS, considering all that has changed since “an iPod, a phone, an internet communicator.” I’ve tuned in to the output of explicitly Apple-adjacent publications both old (_MacRumors_, _Apple Insider_, _9to5 Mac_, etc,) and new (_Apple Scoop_, _MacStories_,) which have all metamorphosed in huge, mostly-redeemable ways just as their primary subject has. I have my own pubescent stories of Mac occultism, but I do not consider my relationship with the brand to be an essential part of my identity, as so many do and have. Apple, Inc’s story is spectacular and infinitely-relevant so long as they remain “the most valuable company in the history of the world,” as I so love to describe them. Like many of you, I’m sure, I am often compelled to bring up the humongous contrasts in the historical context of the company - to scream infinitely many variations of the observation that Apple was basically the fucking _indie_, premium-tier consumer tech manufacturer owned by the Creative Class for the first half+ of their existence, and have somehow maintained that _Think Different_™ brand narrative as they have definitively become the Big Blue of their time.\n\nFrom my perspective, the responsibility for the wellbeing of this utterly-delusional, occasionally very dangerous sentiment actually lies fairly squarely on those of us who consider ourselves _better than all of that_ because of our Debian workflows and their ancient command line utilities. (For the record, this is also 100% delusional as things stand in 2021.) One thing I think we can all acknowledge, though, is that Apple’s image has been inextricably bound with _musicmaking_, throughout, far more than any other even remotely comparable tech company. Naturally, the business still loves to bring this up all the time in big, glossy gestures. The topical example of note would be the only worthwhile content I’ve yet to encounter on Apple TV+: _[Billie Eilish: The World’s a Little Blurry](https:\/\/tv.apple.com\/us\/movie\/billie-eilish-the-worlds-a-little-blurry\/umc.cmc.5waz3hfo9r1133t8arap8b6nq)_, which documents the highlights of the young, beloved musician’s prodigious ascension. For what it’s worth, I appreciate some special insights I gained thanks to the film, which I do not actually consider at odds with the truth of its super on-brandness for Apple.\n\nAn interesting take I found from 2017 from a new favorite voice on the _business_ end of tech reporting: “[How Music Drowns Apple’s Innovation](http:\/\/thein.fo\/8dba9a5022e1d273)” by _The Information_’s Jessica Lessin portrays Apple’s relationship with music distribution and the music industry as a sort of compulsive distraction from its ambitions in serving video content, namely. Lessin points out the everpresent reminders of this obsession:\n\n> And so it is no wonder that Apple’s first forays into original video content fall under Apple Music. It’s worth noting that the first series the company announced—“Carpool Karaoke” is literally about singing; “Planet of the Apps” features rapper Will.i.am as a judge.\n\nI think I can speak for the majority of my audience when I suggest that the targets of Lessin’s cynicism would be more than welcome, if they were The Whole Truth. Indeed, the most valuable company in all of history retaining an “emotional” attachment to the welfare of music creators might be described as _charming_ or more. As is often the case on _The Information_, the comments from readers often offer noteworthy insight. In this case, Kevin Swint - who has apparently worked as an executive for both Apple and Samsung, according to [his profile](https:\/\/www.theinformation.com\/contributors\/458) on _The Information_ - responded with an important consideration: “…it's possible that Apple's behavior around music has more to do with the company's overall tendency to stick with its past successes a bit too long rather than music really being a core part of its DNA.”\n\nIn terms of business, that’s all I have to contribute, and I shall do my best not to evangelize Apple Music (or more likely, disparage Spotify as one of the most destructive cultural forces of our time,) here. However, I would like to respond to a particular Jimmy Iovine quote from the original Apple Music announcement amid the [2015 WWDC Keynote](https:\/\/podcasts.apple.com\/us\/podcast\/apple-events-video\/id275834665?i=1000430692668):\n\n> There needs to be a place where music can be treated less like digital bits and more like the art it is, with a sense of respect and discovery… and if that place could actually accommodate and support the artists who make the music, not just the top-tier artists, but the kids in their bedrooms too, provide them all with a home and a way to engage with their audiences, that would be pretty great.\n\n_Boy, this service Iovine describes sounds an awful lot like Bandcamp, no?_ The suggestion that **Apple should have purchased Bandcamp** is a very scary one, from my perspective, but I am reassured by the likelihood that the notion did indeed occur to someone at Apple, Inc. at some point in the past, and was quickly discarded, for whatever reason. I promise not to mention Bandcamp again in this Post, aside from its own two iOS apps: for [listeners](https:\/\/apps.apple.com\/us\/app\/bandcamp\/id706408639) and for “[Artists\/Labels](https:\/\/apps.apple.com\/us\/app\/bandcamp-for-artists-labels\/id1185670538)” as creator\/curator tools.\n\nI’m going to be focusing largely on the iPhone-bound experience, here, though I did borrow my mom’s MacBook Pro for a weekend to explore the state of music on MacOS and (accidentally) played around with [Apple Music on The Television](https:\/\/youtu.be\/AazMEzHPN-0) (a surprisingly beautiful experience.) On that note, I’ll hurry up and get specific…\n\n<!--more-->\n\n## Apps\n\nAssuming you’re already an Apple Music user, it’s very possible that you’ve been deprived of the “true” experience on the service provided by the variety of actively-developed but woefully-undercovered app store entries that integrate directly with Apple Music. One of the most glaring discoveries I’ve made so far in my iOS deep dive, this year, has been the absolutely horrific state of Discovery on Apple’s App Store. If you’d thought to search the top charts under the store’s Music category, you wouldn’t find any of the gems I’m going to highlight, here. The credit for exposing me to their existence, in fact, lies with _MacStories_ - a hard-hitting, well-established Apple-adjacent media company piloted by [Federico Viticci](https:\/\/twitter.com\/viticci). At this very moment, their app-centric podcast, _App Stories_, is in the midst of [a special mini-series](https:\/\/appstories.net\/episodes\/212\/) devoted to Music on iOS\/Mac, from which this Post draws upon heavily. For better or worse, they represent the definitive authority on this subject (among many others, naturally,) though I wouldn’t necessarily recommend their various publications be added to the reading lists of any but those most invested in iOS.\n\n![MusicHarbor on iPhone](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/4agfF1nW.png)\n\n### [MusicHarbor](https:\/\/apps.apple.com\/us\/app\/musicharbor-track-new-music\/id1440405750)\n\nThere is something uniquely concrete about a purely-chronological feed which we’ve lost in the past 5-10 years in favor of algorithmic curation, generally. The [next item](https:\/\/bilge.world\/tweetbot-6-ios-review) in _this_ particular feed, in fact, includes my attempt to explain why Twitter’s hard-chronological Lists feature has sheltered me from the anxiety of the service’s main timeline, now ordered by proprietary (and obscured) formulas. I’d been aware of that dynamic in my own Twitter consumption for years, though. I certainly did _not_ anticipate the impact of the music release equivalent of a chronological timeline as provided by **[MusicHarbor](https:\/\/apps.apple.com\/us\/app\/musicharbor\/id1440405750)** - an app for iOS and MacOS that acts as a frontend for one’s music library across both Apple Music and Spotify.\n\nIt's hard to remember how we (Apple Music) got here without embarking upon some gargantuan _A Complete Visual History of Apple Music_-like document, but it must be said that Tim Cook's \"next chapter in music\" has become a sad afterthought. As far as I understand it, the \"streaming war\" between Apple and Spotify has long since gone definitively to the latter in statistical terms, which I'd suggest to be an overall positive outcome for Apple Music subscribers, generally. The self-perception within the heavy music consumer crowd of \"niche,\" \"underground,\" \"obscure\" cultural minority should - in theory - push those who believe themselves _destined to be different_ away from Spotify into the handy care of Apple, the absolute champion of this particular self-deception. To be honest - though I write this for _all_ listeners, sincerely - I have found myself in a sort of utopian echo chamber of my own design in music culture terms. My days of waiting through 4+ hours of local openers before rap shows are far behind me, and I consume and engage exclusively with music I find personally redeemable.\n\nMy Apple Music library has become quite fragmented after I lost my entire physical music collection along with the external drives containing my accumulated digital music library in 2017. Still, after more or less starting anew this past December and casually, deliberately adding digital files back into the accursed, ancient iTunes desktop application and restoring some (outdated) versions of my handful of shared curatorial playlists thanks to SongShift (which we'll glance on later,) MusicHarbor currently lists 1433 artists represented across my Apple Music and (very sparse) Spotify libraries. I know this because of [a very simple Siri Shortcut](https:\/\/routinehub.co\/shortcut\/8935\/) I modified which returns a text list of all Artists in one's MusicHarbor library in Quick Look. ([Here is my result](https:\/\/gist.github.com\/extratone\/32763d8d2d6a71ab0fe4e045a6fb4441) as of this moment in GitHub Gist form.) According my App Store receipts, I first downloaded MusicHarbor on March 26 - 20 days ago - which is mentionable because of how much I've accomplished with very minimal time investment in terms of curating my own music library thanks to MusicHarbor. As you'll note in the 3rd of the 4 screenshots embedded above, I was able to delete System of a Down from my library - a single function which alone justifies the app's one-time $5.99 \"Unlock Everything\" fee, to my sensibility. I've also been able to begin following all the artists represented in a few of my favorite playlists with a handful of taps - a task which would literally require hours in the native Apple Music app of old (when one could actually follow artists, there.) On that note, it's time to cite the primary _MacStories_ article you should read, entitled \"[How I Keep Track of New Music Releases](https:\/\/www.macstories.net\/ios\/how-i-keep-track-of-new-music-releases\/),\" regarding Apple Music's performance as a release tracker:\n\n> The ‘New Releases’ section is tucked at the very end of the For You page and laid out as a horizontal carousel that requires a lot of swiping; you can view the ‘New Releases’ page as a grid, which has sections for different weeks, but, in my experience, it only aggregates highlights for new releases from some of my favorite artists. The ‘New Music Mix’ playlist is not terrible, but it often comes loaded with stale data – songs I’ve already listened to multiple times and which shouldn’t qualify as “new” weeks after their original release date. Furthermore, I’ve found notifications for new releases for artists in my library unreliable at best: I occasionally get notifications for new albums, but never for new singles or EPs.\n\nHere, Federico Viticci is riffing off [a newsletter issue](https:\/\/chorus.fm\/features\/liner-notes-november-1st-2019\/) written by music blogger Jason Tate, in which he describes the service's missing tracking functionality as \"the single most frustrating part of Apple Music.\" Though these points in the conversation are both almost two years old, MusicHarbor remains the ultimate means of tracking new music releases chronologically on Apple's platforms. Though I am personally just three weeks in, the confidence this app has given me in the certainty of its chronological release feed is quite profound. Its integration with one's calendar to track _upcoming_ releases is a bit much for my own needs, but I know personally enough invested curators for whom it'd be a godsend to mark it no small addition.\n\n![MusicHarbor on MacOS](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/UxLBTYvL.png)\n\nMusicHarbor’s only downside is entirely excusable\/understandable, in context: it’s a bit clunky. For the sake of this work, I set up [a shared Apple Music playlist](https:\/\/music.apple.com\/us\/playlist\/musicharbor\/pl.u-2aoq40vTaR0XmA) so I could further demonstrate all the new music I discovered in MusicHarbor. Adding whole albums to this playlist with a single tap _feels_ powerful because it _is_ - I’ve no idea what sort of developer wizardry is involved in such an action, but the Wait Wheel doesn’t feel like too much to endure. Adding a release to one’s library - the other in-MusicHarbor accumulative function - is a bit quicker. It’s important to remember that this piece of software was\/is created and maintained by a single human being, though I would expect nothing but improvement, going forward.\n\n![Adding to MusicHarbor Playlist](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/yN3nbcdR.png)\n\nThat’s all I have to report on MusicHarbor, for the moment, but I’ll add further _MacStories_ praise from their [2019 MacStories Selects](https:\/\/www.macstories.net\/stories\/macstories-selects-2019-recognizing-the-best-apps-of-the-year\/#app-of-the-year-runner-up) app rewards:\n\n> What makes MusicHarbor special – and, ultimately, the reason why we all use the app here at MacStories – is just how much developer Tanaka understands what someone who wants to know about new music releases is looking for.\n\n**July 2021 Update**: The MacStories gentlemen have just published [an interview episode of ](https:\/\/appstories.net\/episodes\/230)_[AppStories](https:\/\/appstories.net\/episodes\/230)_ speaking at length with MusicHabor creator Marcos Tanaka.\n\n![Albums for iOS](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/KylIYzaI.png)\n\n### [Albums](https:\/\/apps.apple.com\/us\/app\/albums-album-focused-player\/id1469948986)\n\nOn the other end of the spectrum, exploring new digital manifestations of _The Music Collection_, is [Albums](https:\/\/apps.apple.com\/us\/app\/albums-album-focused-player\/id1469948986), which actually functions as an entire replacement frontend player for Apple Music. Reviewed [much more recently by ](https:\/\/www.macstories.net\/reviews\/albums-4-0-a-must-have-app-for-music-lovers\/)_[MacStories](https:\/\/www.macstories.net\/reviews\/albums-4-0-a-must-have-app-for-music-lovers\/)_, it really is best-described as “opinionated, favoring album playback over individual songs or playlists.” Considering that I installed the app just a week ago and have focused most of my attention on MusicHarbor in that time, I’ll leave most of the commentary to John Voorhees. All I can say, really, is that I see an extremely powerful application, here, for a fairly specific use case: someone who’s listening is largely occupied by albums they already “own” in Apple Music and treasure deeply. The ability to set an individual record’s “Immersive UI Tint” down to the hex (in “Album Settings”) is as in-depth a tool of adoration as I’ve ever seen in a digital music service. Combined with Albums’ presumptuous takeover of actual playback from the Apple Music app, I think I can rightfully say that it was built for the _extremely serious_ music consumer.\n\nMy favorite part so far: the app knew well enough to offer me THE ZRO BUTTON. Telling, I think.\n\n![The ZRo Button - Albums App](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/9pNf178x.jpeg)\n\n### Others\n\nSince it’s already quite clear how much this Post draws from _MacStories_, I’ll let [their review of Soor](https:\/\/www.macstories.net\/reviews\/soor-2-review-magic-mixes-and-release-alerts-elevate-the-beautiful-apple-music-client\/) stand on its own (I couldn’t quite justify spending $6.99 just for review purposes.) In the episode embedded above, they also mention [Denim](https:\/\/apps.apple.com\/us\/app\/denim-playlist-cover-maker\/id1532250420) - a playlist cover creator I am not personally all that impressed with. There’s also MusicHarbor’s sibling, [MusicSmart](https:\/\/www.macstories.net\/reviews\/musicsmart-puts-the-spotlight-on-music-credits\/), which manages the tricky but essential task of adding the metadata retrieval Apple Music should have included all along. The rest can be found in [the episode’s show notes](https:\/\/appstories.net\/episodes\/213\/). I’m not done with them, but the rest are what I would differentiate as _services_…\n\n## Services\n\n<!--more-->\n\n### [Odesli\/Song.Link](https:\/\/song.link\/ivyhollivana)\n\nOne of the bewilderingly undercovered digital music sharing tools of our kind, Odesli has been [my preferred method](https:\/\/twitter.com\/search?q=song.link%2C%20%40neoyokel&f=live) of sharing tracks\/albums\/EPs since I first discovered it in 2018. It is _not_ specific to iOS but it _is_ **essential** for competent music sharing, anywhere, these days, in its magical ability to _correctly_ intersect any given piece of music’s links across all streaming services, known and unknown. To be honest, I thought everybody would be using it by now, but it’s continued to develop with [minimal attention](https:\/\/twitter.com\/odesli_\/status\/1383100269320409095) aside from [Siri Shortcuts developers](https:\/\/www.notion.so\/iOS-Shortcuts-0efaf0ef92c0467aa6fc201b78c8499e). Thanks to [Odesli’s Public API](https:\/\/www.notion.so\/Public-API-d8093b1bb8874f8b85527d985c4f9e68), dozens of Music-centric Siri Shortcuts have emerged over the past few years, resulting in one of the most useful Siri Shortcuts integrations to be found for real, reasonable human beings. Here’s where Apple-adjacent media and I part ways…\n\nWhile current common conversation might point you to Federico Viticci’s [MusicBot hyper-Shortcut](https:\/\/www.macstories.net\/ios\/introducing-musicbot-the-all-in-one-apple-music-assistant-powered-by-shortcuts\/) and\/or @gianflo6’s 600 action-strong [Song.Link Shortcut](https:\/\/routinehub.co\/shortcut\/5134\/), I (perhaps expectedly) would point you to [my own, 17-action Shortcut](https:\/\/routinehub.co\/shortcut\/8940\/) which spares you any selections and simply opens the Song.Link URL of the track currently playing in Apple Music (while also copying said URL to the clipboard.) It’s not that MusicBot isn’t massively impressive and still useful, but it represents a class of super\/hyper-Shortcuts which (from my perspective) _far_-overreach beyond the intended use case for Siri Shortcuts and end up immediately bewildering\/alienating potential new users. Truthfully - as Federico singularly acknowledges - they are full _applications_ built atop a less-than-ideal platform designed for relatively simple, _repeatable_ automations. I’ll spare you further opining on this idea until another, potential Post, and instead demonstrate my personal solution.\n\nhttps:\/\/imgur.com\/gallery\/eblzlbD\n\nIn the clip above, you can see I was working on this very draft when LoneMoon’s “[kawAii @F](https:\/\/song.link\/i\/1554970332)” started playing. Naturally, I was compelled to share it on Twitter, so - without leaving Drafts (my writing app) - I called the [type-to-Siri](https:\/\/support.apple.com\/guide\/iphone\/siri-iphaff1d606\/ios) prompt by holding the Sleep\/Wake button on my iPhone 12 Pro Max and simply typed “sl” (I renamed my Shortcut for this use,) running the Shortcut, which opened the track’s Song.Link page in Safari - very much an optional step, mostly just to make sure the match is correct - and copied its URL to my clipboard, from which I could share it anywhere. Since the advent of widgets in iOS’ [Today View](https:\/\/support.apple.com\/guide\/iphone\/add-widgets-to-the-home-screen-iphb8f1bf206\/ios), I’ve also kept a button for this Shortcut in one of four precious slots in a box at the very top. For those willing to play around a bit, it should be fairly straightforward to configure the end bits to your liking, but it should work out of the box for even those least interested in Siri Shortcuts\/automation in general.\n\n![SongShift Playlist Transfer](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/64kwh52h.png)\n\n### [SongShift](https:\/\/apps.apple.com\/us\/app\/songshift\/id1097974566)\n\nAs I confessed before, it is only thanks to SongShift that I was able to recover anything of my original, prized, deeply-considered Apple Music playlists. The [standalone ](https:\/\/www.macstories.net\/reviews\/songshift-3-0-and-switching-between-apple-music-and-spotify\/)_[MacStories](https:\/\/www.macstories.net\/reviews\/songshift-3-0-and-switching-between-apple-music-and-spotify\/)_[ article](https:\/\/www.macstories.net\/reviews\/songshift-3-0-and-switching-between-apple-music-and-spotify\/) on this one is a bit dated, but I don’t see much change in function in that time. For most people, SongShift’s free service is simply the best way to transfer a playlist between music streaming services. If you find yourself genuinely sold by the features offered by [SongShift Pro](https:\/\/songshift.com\/pro), I suspect you know more about playlist manipulation than I could ever learn you by diving in any deeper.\n\n![Lastfm on iOS](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/HLJEWX0B.png)\n\n### [Last.fm](https:\/\/apps.apple.com\/us\/app\/last-fm\/id1188681944) (I s2g.)\n\nYup… Believe it or not, Last.fm is _still fucking scrobbling_ after 19 fucking years (almost to the day,) and its iOS app still fucking works. What’s most bizarre about this truth is that I did not encounter mention of Last.fm for _years_ until I started noticing it as an integration option in the settings menus of _these premium iOS apps_. Is this some sort of conspiracy? I’m not sure, but I suppose I might as well insist you follow my ancient account, if you’re still using it.\n\n<!--more-->\n\nI should also note that not only is the Last.fm iOS app still working, it’s _working well_, from all appearances, anyway. Though the service no longer includes hosting, itself, it’s apparently still a prime player in the world of **playback tracking**.\n\nhttps:\/\/youtube.com\/watch?v=pSDCbXGIovM\n\n## Music Creation\n\n### DAWs\n\nWhat if you actually want to “make” music with your iPhone? We’ve seen iPhone television ads for years featuring amalgamations of musician-looking types playing instruments with cables attached to their handsets, but is the iPhone now a reasonable platform for any sort of serious sound capture? The short answer is **no**. Who am I to proclaim such an absolute? None other than the motherfucker who’s been messing around with mobile DAWs for [10 whole years](https:\/\/twitter.com\/neoyokel\/status\/150752825129971712). I even “released” an “[album](https:\/\/dieselgoth.bandcamp.com\/album\/holistic-compliance-portal)” on Bandcamp made exclusively with Apple’s own GarageBand for iOS and inspired by the dangerous life of the contemporary raw milk smuggler. I wouldn’t call it “music,” per se, or an example of what a _real_ electronic producer could pull off in the app, but it does represent its capabilities in the hands of the average user, using mostly default loops.\n\nhttps:\/\/soundcloud.com\/dieselgoth\/wurlie-jam\n\nWhile Apple does publish an Apple Book entitled “[Everyone Can Create Music](https:\/\/books.apple.com\/us\/book\/everyone-can-create-music\/id1434741739)” about GarageBand on iOS, it is specifically directed at _iPad_-bound use. Any serious DAW user uses keyboard shortcuts, which I admit I only discovered recently in GarageBand for iOS. The [official documentation](https:\/\/support.apple.com\/guide\/garageband-ipad\/use-keyboard-shortcuts-chs88452c59a\/ipados) is - once again - for iPad, specifically, but most of them still work on iPhone.\n\n**[FL Studio Mobile](https:\/\/apps.apple.com\/us\/app\/fl-studio-mobile\/id432850619)** - the original third-party iOS-bound DAW - is still going, apparently. While I did, indeed purchase the original version on my iPhone 4, I remember absolutely nothing about it, suggesting I was over my head, even then. There’s also **[Auxy](https:\/\/apps.apple.com\/us\/app\/auxy-music-beat-maker\/id1034348186)**, as covered recently in [this App Store Story](https:\/\/apps.apple.com\/us\/story\/id1478814064) and **[Reason Compact](https:\/\/apps.apple.com\/us\/app\/reason-compact-make-music\/id1253419004)**. I’ve played around with these more recently - since they’re both available in their most primitive forms as a free download - with little to report.\n\n### Capture\n\nDisappointingly, Apple’s own Music Memos - as demonstrated by Chris Welch from _The Verge_ in the embed, above - is currently in the process of being [officially sunsetted](https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2020\/12\/10\/22168102\/apple-music-memos-app-discontinued-export,) and is now no longer available for download on the App Store. As that article notes, users are instead directed toward GarageBand or ye olde native **[Voice Memos](https:\/\/apps.apple.com\/us\/app\/voice-memos\/id1069512134)** to record high quality audio. _However_, if you want to take advantage of the **stereo audio recording** capabilities included in iPhones after the [11 Pro](https:\/\/www.dxomark.com\/apple-iphone-11-audio-review\/), you must either use the native Camera app to capture video (and extract the audio later,) or **[Dolby On](https:\/\/apps.apple.com\/us\/app\/dolby-on-record-audio-video\/id1443964192)** - Dolby’s own iOS app for recording which - if I’m completely honest - will do nothing but _utterly frustrate_ anyone trying to capture the truest digital audio possible.\n\nhttps:\/\/youtube.com\/watch?v=GhAknEKy9Ig\n\nAs part of my [iPhone 12 Pro Max Review](https:\/\/github.com\/extratone\/bilge\/issues\/45), I’ve accumulated quite a few audio files in various formats testing its capture abilities and stashed them in [this folder](https:\/\/github.com\/extratone\/bilge\/tree\/main\/audio\/Capture%20Testing) on _The Psalms_’ GitHub Repository. Probably the most relevant of these, though, is embedded just above. If you’ll forgive my pajamas, ridiculous piano faces, and general rustiness with the instrument, it demonstrates the “**Audio Zoom**” feature found in the iPhone 11 Pro and up, which I’ve found to be unfortunately underdocumented by Apple, itself. I added my own inquiry to [this post on the official Developer forums](https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/forums\/thread\/124512?answerId=671299022#671299022) asking about it, but don’t really expect anything back. According to “[What is Audio Zoom for smartphones](https:\/\/www.dxomark.com\/what-is-audio-zoom-for-smartphones\/)?” published on the site _DxOMark_:\n\n> The main technology behind audio zoom is called beamforming, or spatial filtering. It allows changing an audio recording’s directivity (that is, the sensitivity according to the direction of the sound source) and shape it in any way necessary. In this case, the optimal directivity is a hypercardioid pattern (see illustration below), which enhances sounds coming from the front direction — that is, from the direction in which your camera is pointed — while attenuating sounds from all other directions (your background noise).\n\nMy testing has suggested that **the best means of recording unfiltered-as-possible stereo audio with an iPhone is to record video at 1x zoom with the native Camera app** and extract the audio from the video file. In the [Bandcamp track embedded below](https:\/\/davidblue.bandcamp.com\/track\/-), I “mounted” my 12 Pro Max right above my old upright’s soundboard and extracted audio directly from the video file with Audacity. It was then amplified slightly, saved to a FLAC file and uploaded directly to Bandcamp. Of course, it’s worth qualifying that - while I have extensive experience with audio - I have neither professional training, nor any professional monitoring equipment.\n\nhttps:\/\/davidblue.bandcamp.com\/track\/-\n\nThat said, the biggest objection I’ve heard from audiophiles regarding audio capture and manipulation on handsets, generally, has to do with their hardware’s extremely limited capabilities when compared to any sort of professional desktop soundcard. Given the greater argument I've come to regarding the state of consumer tech as best exemplified by smartphone design - that we've come to expect _far_ too much of single devices, and the resulting jack-of-all-tradeness summing their real-life capabilities has become a **severe detriment** instead of a feature - I must echo, again, that adding \"studio\" audio capture, manipulation, and production capabilities to our _goddamned cellular phones_ doesn't help anyone. To any user truly hoping to accomplish these things, I say _just go home_ and boot up your damned desktop.\n\n![Mushish - Apple Music Web Player](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/LGQO6IGJ.png)\n\n## Other Considerations\n\nThe final episode in _AppStories_' three-part miniseries on music was [just published today](https:\/\/appstories.net\/episodes\/214\/), though I suspect - for my audience, anyway - that its coverage is mostly out-of-scope on this topic, largely for financial reasons. Apple's first event of the year is [scheduled for tomorrow at noon](https:\/\/youtu.be\/JdBYVNuky1M), my time, and is entitled \"Spring Loaded,\" which - combined with its 4\/20 joke date - suggests to me that we'll finally see the release of the APPLE GUN™ alongside iWeed™, but little to nothing in the way of music.\n\nIn the midst of my brief research into _The Greater History of Apple Music_, I discovered [the existence of iTunes Ping](https:\/\/thenextweb.com\/news\/apple-shuttering-failed-social-music-network-ping-september-30th) - which I somehow missed entirely, [along with my Twitter friend Jon Male](https:\/\/twitter.com\/mrjaydeeem\/status\/1379305438454423559). I also discovered articles from the company's decision to [kill its successor \"Connect\" from Apple Music](https:\/\/thenextweb.com\/news\/apple-music-is-dropping-its-connect-social-features), which was reportedly \"[rarely used](https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2018\/12\/13\/18139837\/apple-music-connect-social-network-feature-discontinued).\" Notably, this removal also [took away](https:\/\/9to5mac.com\/2018\/12\/13\/apple-music-connect-ping\/) what little power Artists had over the narrative surrounding their music on the service. I can see the business justification for all of this (barely) _except_ for removing the ability for users to follow artists.\n\nThe latest Apple Music feature - [a \"channel\" for music videos](https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2020\/10\/19\/21523091\/apple-music-videos-tv-channel-live-stream) - also makes zero sense to me, but [the launch of Apple Music on the web](https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2019\/9\/5\/20851576\/apple-music-web-player-interface-beta-browser-streaming) _absolutely_ does, especially for Windows and Linux users, who are now _officially_ freed from iTunes (the software) and allowed to use a much more modern Apple Music experience. I prepended \"officially,\" there, because third-party Apple Music web players have existed as long as the service has allowed the required integration. First, there was [Naveed Golafshani's](https:\/\/www.macrumors.com\/2018\/12\/13\/apple-music-unofficial-web-player\/) - which is [no longer live](https:\/\/github.com\/naveedgol\/music-web-player) - but Brychan Bennett-Odlum's **[Musish](https:\/\/www.macrumors.com\/2019\/01\/21\/apple-music-web-player-musish\/)** is still [live and working](https:\/\/musi.sh\/), as you can see from the screenshot embedded above. Other than the ability to select between two stream bitrates, I can't seen any remaining advantages to using the latter over Apple's own web player, unless you harbor spite toward their handling of the whole thing, which would be entirely understandable, from my perspective.\n\nhttps:\/\/twitter.com\/NeoYokel\/status\/1359364473253937153\n\nAs someone who grew up in the mp3 era with a [first-generation iPod Shuffle](https:\/\/twitter.com\/NeoYokel\/status\/1359364473253937153) and iTunes, living and dying between iTunes Store gift cards, Apple Music still seems like one hell of a magical deal. In effect, it allows access to _all of iTunes_ for a flat monthly fee.

If, indeed, Jessica Lessin was correct about Apple's obsession with music, it has resulted in very little for any class of music makers, and left even its listeners to seek out and find third-party solutions like MusicHarbor to perform even the most basic personalization one expects from a modern music streaming service without even bothering to amend their App Store's discovery process to illuminate them, or even write a fucking App Story. Despite this, one-to-three-person app teams continue to work on new solutions, to these and other problems...\n\n<!--comment-->\n\n#music #software","views":1558,"updated":"2023-04-01T14:56:31Z","tags":["music","software"],"type":null,"title":"iPhone and Music: For Artists, Curators, and Enthusiasts","slug":"iphone-ios-music-apps","appearance":"norm","language":"en","rtl":false,"created":"2021-04-19T21:08:33Z","images":["https:\/\/i.snap.as\/mTEozs2r.png","https:\/\/i.snap.as\/yN3nbcdR.png","https:\/\/i.snap.as\/KylIYzaI.png","https:\/\/i.snap.as\/9pNf178x.jpeg","https:\/\/i.snap.as\/LGQO6IGJ.png","https:\/\/i.snap.as\/4agfF1nW.png","https:\/\/i.snap.as\/UxLBTYvL.png","https:\/\/i.snap.as\/64kwh52h.png","https:\/\/i.snap.as\/HLJEWX0B.png"],"collection":{"public":false,"alias":"extratone","total_posts":0,"title":"Extratone","verification_link":"","description":"For the New Curious.","style_sheet":"","views":182661,"monetization_pointer":""},"paid":false},{"id":"4pjph58n67kbv9zj","body":"![Marco! Banner](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/D6SijbwF.png)\n\n## The first release version of my only original contribution to the iOS community is now ready to assist when you can't find your phone.\n\n<!--more-->\n\nOne of the handful of Siri's most useful features has been the \"Hey Siri! Where are you?\" command, to which Siri will respond \"I'm here\" or \"here I am!\" Were it possible to view how many times one has triggered a particular Siri command on iOS, my personal reliance on it would almost certainly be embarrassing. Often, my handset isn't even obscured from view - it's just faster to have Siri speak up than it is to scan the room. Occasionally, however, my device has managed to become embedded beneath and\/or within some genuinely-perplexing series of couch cushions\/blankets\/briefcase pockets\/etc. which require a more constant homing sort of audio reproduction. Asking friends\/family to call one's phone is the general goto, yes, but honestly the actual length of time cellular telephones will ring before sending a caller to voicemail in 2021 is *ridiculously* short, especially when rummaging through Gourd-knows-what. For that matter, most of my peers keep their phones on silent mode, 24\/7. What then?\n\nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=3evgnSlnkjk\n\nSince [the very first time](https:\/\/bilge.world\/siri-shortcuts-ios12-review) I set eyes upon Siri Shortcuts in iOS 12 Beta, I have wanted to create one to address this issue in a creative, entertaining, and (hopefully) genuinely-useful way. On that day almost three years ago, I even knew it would be called *Marco!*, believe it or not. In the past few months, I've returned to the project on and off and ended up with several different versions of varying complexity. One day, I'd like to figure out how to integrate the full extent of my ideas for Marco! into a Shortcut which can be reliably triggered when one's device is locked, but for this first release version, I have included only what I and a few other (much appreciated) volunteers were able to trigger in every situation we could conceive of.\n\nMarco! Version 1.0 can be downloaded on [**RoutineHub**](https:\/\/routinehub.co\/shortcut\/8987\/) (which I would highly recommend,) or directly via [**this iCloud share link**](https:\/\/www.icloud.com\/shortcuts\/cec781677c5648f2a8982213700938b4). I know it's a bit excessive, but I even created a [GitHub Repository](https:\/\/github.com\/extratone\/marco) just for this Shortcut, seeing as it is undoubtedly the most original I will ever contribute, and the singular one with potential for continued development.\n\nDownload Marco! as is and (as long as you don't rename it) use \"Hey Siri!... Marco!\" This should immediately run the Shortcut, which includes my voice saying \"Polo! Bitch!\" followed by five repeats of the flashlight\/noise cycle as described in detail below.\n\n![Marco! JellyCuts Steps](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/9Ow1cbmz.png)\n\nAs documented by the [Jellycuts file](https:\/\/github.com\/extratone\/marco\/blob\/main\/docs\/Marco!.html) above, Version 1.0 of Marco!'s actions are as follows:\n\n1. Turn Low Power Mode OFF\n2. Turn Airplane Mode OFF\n3. Turn Wi-Fi On\n4. Turn Bluetooth On\n5. Set brightness to 100%\n6. Turn Do Not Disturb OFF\n7. Turn appearance Light\n8. Set playback destination to iPhone\n9. Set volume to 89%\n10. Vibrate device (Not currently working.)\n11. Play **my voice** saying “Polo!” + a few other items\n12. Toggle (flash) the flashlight 5 times (odd number leaving your flashlight on constantly unless it was on before the Shortcut was triggered)\n13. Simultaneously (in the same repeat action) plays three separate classic Mac sounds 5 times.\n\nThe most clever bit about this particular Shortcut is its use of Base64 text to include audio playback. I just fixed a bug on [my own Base64 audio encoder Shortcut](https:\/\/routinehub.co\/shortcut\/8914\/) if you'd like to try it out. Since this version includes my own voice (subject to taste, I realize,) as well as some minor profanity, I do intend to publish a clean variation at some point in the future. If this is an obstacle for you, and\/or if you'd like a custom version made with audio of your own choosing, please do [send me an email](mailto:davidblue@extratone.com)! I would be more than happy to make one for you.\n\n#software #automation","views":1301,"updated":"2022-01-15T13:57:27Z","tags":["software","automation"],"type":null,"title":"Marco!

This year, my return to the iOS community has perhaps inevitably turned _apps_ into an addiction of sorts. This particular platform is so utterly chock full\/stocked up of creativity at a scale immeasurably greater and more accessible than the whole of those throughout computing history, combined. For someone like myself, it is all too easy to allow oneself to wander down a virtually endless path of intriguing, very self-indulgent play, especially now that third-party sites like [Departures.to](https:\/\/departures.to) have managed to add discoverability to TestFlight beta distributions, allowing those non-millionaires among us opportunities to use test releases of applications we would’ve otherwise had to pay for. This has been exclusively to my benefit - I can only imagine what 15 year-old me would have done with such power.\n\n![Your Ratings and Reviews - Apple App Store](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/jIYBC6xU.png)\n\nIn my recent endeavor to focus on making my work more useful to others, I've reflected on something I've heard from nigh every developer of the apps I've reviewed: *Ah yes, your blog looks really cool but FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, PLEASE REVIEW MY FUCKING APP on the FUCKING STORE.* Read: your commentary is appreciated, but your five stars would almost certainly more economically beneficial.\n\nAs you can see from the image embedded above, I have personally fallen *very* behind in doing my part for those apps I've celebrated, here. A vague intention to *get around to it eventually* clearly is not working, so I've decided to give myself a deadline: **August 15th, 2021** - precisely one month from today. By this date, I will have sifted through my commentary on apps in this setting and adapted the most useful of it (per app, obviously) into a manner appropriate to appear on an App Store Page, and **I would like to formally-ish invite other tech writers\/app reviewers to join me**.\n\nhttps:\/\/twitter.com\/NeoYokel\/status\/1402057069927309318\n\nI'm terrible at community organization, which certainly does not exclude events, so I very much welcome any feedback you might have, as well as any collaborative contributions you'd be interested in making. As I see it, I have a few essential considerations to offer. \n\nFirst, the page in the screen capture above - which can be found in the App Store App ⇨ Account (your profile picture in the top-right corner) ⇨ Account Settings (the tapable element at the very top with your profile picture and information) ⇨ Ratings and Reviews - is *broken as hell*, along with the rest of the Account Settings menu, notably. This is important because I insist we all complain about it on all available channels, considering it's been broken for several months, at least.\n\nSecond, you should almost certainly use [**this \"new\" dev-facing tool**](https:\/\/tools.applemediaservices.com\/app-store\/) when searching the App Store, considering that it *actually works* in a trustable way, unlike the user-facing tool in the app.\n\nhttps:\/\/twitter.com\/NeoYokel\/status\/1415732070626758663\n\nSince the standard online palette of event organization software are all so easy to use, these days, I've established event pages for this event on multiple platforms, linked in the list below, which I will update as per any suggestions\/requests for equivalent pages on other services. Of course, it's certainly not a requirement that you join\/engage with any of them.\n\nOne could could certainly just add the date to their own calendar (conveniently with [this .ics file](https:\/\/drive.google.com\/file\/d\/1WM2esll-Yf5Fg4gO9ZYVAJ0pPrdexGqF\/view?usp=sharing),) remain entirely silent about the thing on social, and still be participating.

Perusing through them, I saw two I would have voted for, myself: [CARROT Weather](https:\/\/apps.apple.com\/us\/app\/carrot-weather\/id961390574) - the [beautifully vulgar](https:\/\/twitter.com\/NeoYokel\/status\/1368223231111557125), grumpy bitch frontend for your preferred weather information service, and [Craft](https:\/\/apps.apple.com\/us\/app\/craft-docs-and-notes-editor\/id1487937127) - perhaps the most innovative take on word processing of the past two or three years - listed under \"Finalists.\" (Read: losers.) The most positive personal discovery of (all?) WWDCs: an app called [**Be My Eyes**](https:\/\/www.bemyeyes.com\/), which \"connects blind and low-vision people with sighted volunteers and company representatives for visual assistance through a live video call,\" along with an exceptionally crafted, cross-device accessible-as-fuck TTS solution called [Voice Dream Reader](https:\/\/apps.apple.com\/us\/app\/voice-dream-reader\/id496177674). *However*, a double take in games from *Genshin Impact- and [the fucking *League of Legends* game](https:\/\/apps.apple.com\/ph\/app\/league-of-legends-wild-rift\/id1480616990) certainly sours the mouth and suggests yet further just how much Apple, Inc. has *sold out*. \n\nThe continued prioritization of Growth for Growth's sake over any and all other considerations (namely, users,) is not unexpected from even the most valuable company in the history of the world, I suppose, but there *is* an actor at this point in the story who is catastrophically and demonstrably failing to fulfill their role: all I really know is that technology media has fallen into a trough of total uselessness when it comes to qualitative, authoritative analysis of consumer-targeted software. The necessity of this guide - and the bizarrely silent ignorance of even the \"fringes\" on its subject - is unimaginably severe. Before me has been (for years, now,) the \"answer\" to a Jolly Big Load of what tech and marketing types lament in more and more existential language, yet *hardly any* of the humans with the most to lose from  their negligence - regular, casual social media users - have been delivered to these experiences. The story is not being articulated. **The journalism is not being done.**\n\nI know you almost certainly did not arrive here to hear one motherfucker's complaints about WWDC, but - as with everything Apple, Inc. does - every morsel of curatorial expression\/discrimination\/favoritism from The Great Money God within this platform *must* be scrutinized and criticized. Quite frankly, I found myself completely at a loss as to how *not* to dwell on the Discovery Disparity, here. \n\nDespite how deeply I've gone into iOS this year, I do not believe myself to be a qualified judge of software design, but I no longer believe Apple to be, either. Regardless of the revenue-related controversies of late, Apple have simply become terrible stewards of the App Store in every imaginable sense. Scams and blatant intellectual property theft abound, while the majority of the most innovative entries I've ever seen remain entirely obfuscated and uncelebrated by all of Apple. Inc.'s mechanisms. If you required an explanation for the amount of time I've invested into App Guides - a space to which I never would have imagined intentionally bringing *The Psalms* - I hope you can understand.\n\n<!--more-->\n\nI must confess: I have been *meaning* to write this app guide since even before I [interviewed Mastodon creator Eugen Rochko](https:\/\/bilge.world\/eugen-rochko-interview) on the morning of his Big Press Day, just over 4 years ago. I’ve exhaustively explored different means of convincing my own longtime Twitter friends to move, over that time, with very little success. Eugen, himself, published an [official blog post](https:\/\/blog.joinmastodon.org\/2021\/02\/developing-an-official-ios-app-for-mastodon\/) at the beginning of February detailing his plans to open up onboarding by way of “an official Mastodon app that is free to download and that is specialized in helping new users get started on the platform.” As a Patreon supporter of [The Mastodon Project](https:\/\/www.patreon.com\/mastodon) (full disclosure,) I've been testing this app (see preview shots at the very end,) and am quite smitten with it. That said, I thought it might be worth going over the third-party options iOS users currently have available to them, largely because the offerings are each innovative and mature applications in their own right. (Also, it’s become quite apparent that the normal tech media sources you’d go to for such a guide aren’t going to give Mastodon the attention it deserves.)\n\n![Masto Mascot iOS Art](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/Y624NGHM.jpg)\n\n## Obligatory(?) Context\n\nI originally intended to be as clinical as possible in this Post, having realized its potential as the singular comparison of its kind to appear in search results for new and potential users of Mastodon. From my perspective, Mastodon has long since surpassed regard as a novel social media experiment who's function is to prompt academic conversations about decentralization, open source, ad tech, and federated social's solutions to all of the Big Web's Big Boy (proprietary) Problems (though I have been compelled to [invest significantly](https:\/\/github.com\/extratone\/bigblue) in that very conversation.) In the less intellectual hours of my day-to-day life (read: most of the time,) Mastodon is nothing more or less than my favorite place on the internet. It is a relentless delight which I only lament because I want to share so much of it with my friends, but have continued to fail in my efforts to articulate that **Mastodon is not a compromise; it is a better social space**.\n\nIf you didn't know, this seems to have become *my general shit*, for lack of a better term: the ethical considerations of open source\/\"alternative\" software are very important, yes! ... but they are *far* from the whole, and they are not a requisite for new users. The second of [this World Wide Web Blog's fundamental considerations](https:\/\/bilge.world\/about), in fact:\n\n> The Open Source\/Open Web community continues to struggle with their *brand image* (if you will) in both old and new ways that needlessly alienate (and sometimes obfuscate) some of their most important contributions from the average user. **Technology media has failed in their responsibility to address this issue.**\n\nThe blog on which you're reading this, in fact, is federated on [ActivityPub](https:\/\/activitypub.rocks\/). If you so chose, you could be reading it in any client capable of displaying large bodies of text. The crucial point, though, is that *you didn't need to know that* - you could very well go on reading it on the web in total ignorance\/apathy regarding Federation.\n\n*Oh boy, here we go...* No. I did not want to say anything ideological - I wanted this Post to function as little more than a pretty screenshot showcase and simple associative list responding to all of the Reddit posts I've seen to the tune of \"is there an iPhone app?\" As I explored them, however, I was reminded of the sheer creativity the \"alternative\" software community is capable of. Even the roughest of these considered apps seem unable to be faceless - sorting through the obscene amount of (unlabeled) screenshots accumulated over the past weeks of testing in my Recents folder has been *so* much easier than I thought it would be because of their relentless originality. If you've actually used any iOS applications and\/or browsed the singular App Store from which they can be acquired in the past 3-4 years, you're undoubtedly skeptical: what we might have called \"feature overlap\"  at one time has become all but the platform's core ethos. If you're the sort who enjoys screwing around with apps, generally, as I have for the whole of iPhone history, you have grown accustomed to disappointment.\n\nhttps:\/\/twitter.com\/NeoYokel\/status\/1402057069927309318\n\nRegardless of who is to blame, we can all agree that the App Store is currently oversaturated nigh *beyond usability* with mediocre entries built from the beginning with zero apparent ambition toward original function. This, alone, wouldn't be so problematic if Discovery were not so [completely and totally Fucked](https:\/\/twitter.com\/NeoYokel\/status\/1379068906917224448) (except when [dev-facing](https:\/\/tools.applemediaservices.com\/app-store\/),) but I needn't comment further on that subject at the moment - I'm just trying emphasize how absolutely unheard of it is for a single protocol\/service's third-party client representation on iOS to be so thoroughly special. It was astonishing to find all but one or two of these apps *in a functional state*, actually. In all my equivalent experiences downloading the entirety of a given service's API-supported palette (e.g. IRC apps, [topically](https:\/\/www.vice.com\/en\/article\/pkbgvg\/major-internet-projects-are-leaving-freenode-after-korean-prince-takeover),) an all-too-significant purpose of whatever ends up getting published is simply documenting the ~20% of available titles that *actually work* at the given moment. (I'd have mentioned the \"best [service\/task] iPhone apps for [year]\" listicles found in online publications like *Digital Trends* were it not for the percentage of them in which it's clear the author *did not actually download* some\/most of the apps listed‽‽‽) Perhaps due to [iOS 14.5's implementation of ATT](https:\/\/www.wsj.com\/video\/series\/joanna-stern-personal-technology\/apple-software-chief-explains-ios-145-defends-companys-reach-exclusive\/57D138E3-3677-4A78-9534-62DAD443FE97), all of the Mastodon apps I could find and test (not counting non-English language-supporting apps, in fairness' interest) are currently functioning.\n\nSo, if there's virtually zero chance a new Mastodon user might download one of the apps we're about to consider and find it broken, what practical function remains for this guide? Hopefully, to establish a SEO catch-all for such users from a non-automated source less associated with the project than the official apps list. Those for whom Mastodon is still an unfamiliar subject should find the collected imagery intriguing, hopefully.\n\n![Mastodon iOS Icon Strip](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/H25gzEg2.jpeg)\n\n## The Big 6\n\nMy first step in writing this guide was to post [a thread on r\/Mastodon](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Mastodon\/comments\/mxymr1\/your*thoughts*on*thirdparty*mastodon*clients*for\/) soliciting thoughts on third-party Mastodon apps from other users, who expressed a lot of love for Toot! and Metatext:\n\n> Toot is just a joy to use. It has a little too much sometimes (it actually contains little mini games...which really aren't needed), but the experience of using it has some really clever UI twists. -[u\/mikepictor](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/user\/mikepictor\/)\n\nPragmatic Code's [Linky](https:\/\/apps.apple.com\/us\/app\/linky-for-twitter-and-mastodon\/id438090426) was also mentioned by multiple respondents. It's not a client, but a bridging tool for smoother URL sharing that integrates with iOS' share sheet. I did not have time to try it, myself, but from all accounts, it is an obligatory mention. So too is the [**GitHub Repository\/List**](https:\/\/github.com\/extratone\/mastodon-ios-apps) I created in order to \"formally\" offer a list with much greater brevity and zero editorialization.\n\nFirst, let’s begin with The Big 6 - those apps The Mastodon Project, itself, has seen fit to [list on joinmastodon.org](https:\/\/joinmastodon.org\/apps).\n\nhttps:\/\/youtube.com\/watch?v=LdBFMibyh3Y\n\n### [Toot!](https:\/\/apps.apple.com\/app\/toot\/id1229021451)\n\nDag Ågren‘s [Toot!](https:\/\/apps.apple.com\/us\/app\/toot\/id1229021451) is not only my personal app of choice - I would (and have) go so far as to say it’s the single most innovative mobile social app I’ve ever encountered, largely because of its jacknife-esque instance selection. It’s held a place in my phone’s dock since the day I first downloaded it, for this and many other reasons. While one might find bugs\/loose ends (understandably) exploring the functions of other indie social clients, within Toot!, they will only find little delights, like [its wholly unique Share Sheet interface](https:\/\/imgur.com\/gallery\/xAXs95J).\n\n![Toot! Themes](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/bXG5SAUv.png)\n\nToot! is extremely beautiful (despite its unfortunate name,) and I am quite superficial in my taste. It’s Obsidian theme (which may or may not be related to the topical notetaking system of the same name) is especially gorgeous.\n\n<audio controls>\n  <source src=\"https:\/\/davidblue.wtf\/audio\/tootsounds.mp3\">\n<\/audio>\n\nIn my [cacophonous attempt](https:\/\/mastodon.social\/@DavidBlue\/106302686196643266) to compare the notifications of all available Mastodon apps simultaneously, it's worth noting that Toot!'s always came first. Its [charming custom audio alerts](https:\/\/whyp.it\/t\/toot-ios-app-custom-sounds-92997) also make them my favorite by far.\n\nThey're not just cute: in reflection informed by a newly-considered function of these apps - serving as representing the network as a whole - it occurred to me that **Toot! audio alerts playing from my iPhone have prompted more first-time conversations about Mastodon in the wild than I can count**. (Seriously: they should be considered an onboarding mechanism.)\n\n![Toot! Settings](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/30YJR456.png)\n\nIn my experience, it’s also the most robust of the lot - as in, it is very much the exception rather than the norm to encounter any sort of error or other obstruction in normal, day-to-day use. My own real reservation applies to the entire selection discussed today: I wish Toot! supported Bluetooth keyboard shortcuts.\n\n![Mast for iOS](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/KF4Slx39.png)\n\n### [Mast](https:\/\/apps.apple.com\/us\/app\/mast-for-mastodon\/id1437429129)\n\nI originally had high hopes for Shihab Mehboob‘s [Mast](https:\/\/apps.apple.com\/us\/app\/mast-for-mastodon\/id1437429129) - which used to look very different from the way it does, today. That’s almost certainly to do with its ownership [changing hands](https:\/\/twitter.com\/jpeguin\/status\/1354854403124178947) at some point (no, I do not have any further details on that story, unfortunately.) That’s not to say the current app isn’t a worthwhile offering, it’s just far less *visually ambitious* than the original I remember. However, it’s also significantly more reliable.\n\nhttps:\/\/twitter.com\/JPEGuin\/status\/1354854403124178947\n\n![Mast Details](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/UsH95qJv.png)\n\n![Amaroq for iOS](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/JV5vzmky.png)\n\n### [Amaroq](https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20210114192741\/https:\/\/apps.apple.com\/us\/app\/amarok-for-mastodon\/id1214116200)\n\nThe Original… Genesis… If Amaroq was not the first Mastodon app on the App Store, it’s certainly the oldest to survive. Its GitHub Repository’s [first commit](https:\/\/github.com\/ReticentJohn\/Amaroq\/commit\/9648ebdecf8ab20819ba10fe18b6317a8026fd86) dates back to April 17th, 2017.  While you’re there, you might note that it’s the only one of these entries coded entirely in Objective-C - the near-40-year-old language originally underpinning iOS before Swift’s birth in 2014. Amaroq was the first Mastodon app I used and remains the strongest free option for iOS users. It’s been nearly a year since its last update, so its missing a few narrower functions like Bookmarking and Polls, but the core features it *does* include are rock solid. The only wild card: what the fuck is Awoo Mode???\n\n![iMast for iOS](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/7A9pJMzD.png)\n\n### [iMast](https:\/\/apps.apple.com\/us\/app\/imast\/id1229461703)\n\nFor better or worse, [@rinsuki](https:\/\/mstdn.rinsuki.net\/@rinsuki)’s iMast will require either a basic grasp of the Japanese language, or the patience to translate its menus and work backwards. (OCR came to mind, but I’m not quite dedicated enough to try it for this guide.) Assuming [Google’s translation](https:\/\/documentcloud.adobe.com\/link\/review?uri=urn:aaid:scds:US:64ce057e-5adc-4578-a0ef-e9ddb6b5d545) of [its GitHub Pages site](https:\/\/cinderella-project.github.io\/iMast\/) is correct, iMast is also Open Source “under the Apache License 2.” Unlike Amaroq, it appears to have been built in Swift from the ground up. Unfortunately, that's about all I can comment on, though I would very much love to hear from any iMast users\/Japanese speakers and will update this Post accordingly.\n\nA function I *can* provide: documenting [iMast’s Bluetooth keyboard shortcuts](https:\/\/github.com\/extratone\/imastodon\/blob\/main\/documentation\/iMastKeyboardShortcuts.md).\n\n#### iMast’s Keyboard Shortcuts\n\n| Action              | Key        |\n|:-------------------:|:----------:|\n| Open Compose Window | ⌘ + N      |\n| Send Toot           | ⌘ + Return |\n| Home Timeline       | ⌘ + 1      |\n| Notifications       | ⌘ + 2      |\n| Local Timeline      | ⌘ + 3      |\n| Others (Menu)       | ⌘ + 9      |\n\niMast is also the singular Mastodon app with a Siri Shortcuts action!\n\n![Mercury for iOS - Scoops Theme](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/ScJoTz8e.png)\n\n\n### [Mercury](https:\/\/apps.apple.com\/us\/app\/mercury-for-mastodon\/id1486749200)\n\nDaniel Nitsikopoulos' [Mercury](https:\/\/onmercury.app) represents yet another entirely original direction in Social clients. It's fresh and \"opinionated\" in its explicit lack of support for instances that \"[promote abuse and harassment](https:\/\/onmercury.app\/help).\" From all appearances, this appears to be the singular source of negative reviews on [its iOS App Store page](https:\/\/apps.apple.com\/us\/app\/mercury-for-mastodon\/id1486749200). It's also the other option to offer widgets integration (in a single form, currently,) and custom audio notifications, though I couldn't capture a sample. Its [Trello Roadmap](https:\/\/trello.com\/b\/6EseiLSQ\/mercury-roadmap) and [Feedback Repo](https:\/\/github.com\/dNitza\/mercury-issues\/issues) are public but mostly inactive. As you can see in the grid embedded above, I absolutely adore its Scoops theme and find my $0.99 Tip 100% worth its custom icons.\n\n<img src=\"https:\/\/i.snap.as\/r8Qc4BPc.jpeg\" alt=\"Mercury for iOS - Negative App Store Reviews\" style=\"zoom: 25%;\" \/>\n\nUnfortunately, the state of Mercury's App Store reviews prompt yet another essential economic\/editorial consideration. The one in the very center of the image embedded, above - from \"FeralDandelion\" - is the singular one I will allow myself to address. It is true that Mercury straight up refuses to authenticate or federate with a substantial amount of specific Mastodon servers, but it is **exhaustively explicit about this from very get-go**. Its [single-page Help document](https:\/\/onmercury.app\/help) includes a detailed, up-to-date table of every single blocked instance and *the specific justification* for each respective instance's presence on it:\n\n> Mercury takes a zero tolerance stance on abuse and harassment and as such does not support many instances that promote abuse and harassment.\n\nLet me be clear: the practical manifestation of this position is **exclusively positive**. The Mastodon project has long outgrown the sort of fixation on ideology for ideology's sake that even Lucky Linus himself has no patience for. Instead, *thank Gourd* Mercury's developers took the time to better your social experience! In response to statements like the pullquote above, I expect *only* thumbs in the air from this point, forward.\n\n![Metatext for iOS](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/w7PTFpTf.png)\n\n### [Metatext](https:\/\/apps.apple.com\/app\/metatext\/id1523996615)\n\nMetatext is perhaps the buzziest of all these apps - well-praised in every space I could find conversation on the subject. It's developed under [Justin Mazzocchi](https:\/\/mastodon.social\/@jzzocc)'s software studio, [Metabolist](https:\/\/metabolist.org\/) and is as [Open Source](https:\/\/github.com\/metabolist\/metatext) as it gets! (As per my hardware keyboard shortcuts crusade, I added [my own issue](https:\/\/github.com\/metabolist\/metatext\/issues\/40) requesting support.) [u\/GummyKibble](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/user\/GummyKibble\/) noted that \"it looks like a native app on both iOS and iPadOS.\" This term - *native* - seems inextricably linked with Metatext. I vaguely understand what it means, and I do agree, but it's worth noting that I speak with some privilege, having compared all of these apps on the top performing handset Apple currently has to offer. In many ways, it is the most frugal of the new offerings, especially, yet it strikes a keen balance between function and delight. I think \"native\" can be translated as *generally of a stout, sturdy disposition*, thanks to the care put into honing said balance. \n\n## Less-Than-Sanctioned\n\n![Tootle for iOS](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/S6VkSlY0.png)\n\n### [Tootle](https:\/\/apps.apple.com\/us\/app\/tootle-for-mastodon\/id1236013466)\n\nI'm not entirely positive which Mastodon app was *actually* the first on my iPhone, back in 2017, but I know for sure it was either Amaroq or the dearest, infinitely-colorful Tootle. Its [App Store Page](https:\/\/mastodon.cloud\/@tootleapp) Version History suggests it has not been updated in 14 months, yet the app - which was apparently \"Designed for iPad\" - appears to be working just fine. There are some overlapping UI elements, but they're barely noticeable. Were it not for the new dev-facing store search tool mentioned above, I would have assumed this app long gone, to be honest, but using it again has somehow managed to genuinely twinge my nostalgia nerve.\n\nIn my search for any extra-App Store representation other than [Tootle's Mastodon Account](https:\/\/mastodon.cloud\/@tootleapp) (which last posted the day after my birthday, last year,) I discovered [Tootle... for Linux](https:\/\/ubuntuhandbook.org\/index.php\/2020\/11\/tootle-l-gtk3-mastodon-client-linux\/). Since I am a dedicated and thorough person, these days, I spent several hours messing around with Linux Virtual Machining until Lubuntu finally functioned *just* so I could show you what it looks like. Below is a screen capture of Tootle bordered by the most Macish LXQ desktop bars included in Lubuntu and *even* wearing the new official Apple System Font, SF Pro. Still, I think you'll agree... Tootle for Linux is not related to Tootle.\n\n![Tootle for Linux](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/Rx3Eu9GA.png)\n\nPersonally, I find this a profound shame - I think more apps should be as colorful - and as color *configurable* - as this little, mysterious Mastodon app. I created the theme you see represented in the frames embedded above using *The Psalms- colors, naturally, and the whole process took less than five minutes. Play around with it as I remember doing, all those years ago, and you'd be surprised how hard it is to create an unusable color theme. What I find *most* shame in, though, is that Tootle appears to be completely invisible in regular app store searches, now. (And by \"*most* shame,\" you know I really mean *entirely fucking unacceptable*.)\n\nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=WBZtmOqyk8c\n\n![Tusker on iOS](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/82RtZcyl.png)\t\n### [Tusker](https:\/\/testflight.apple.com\/join\/wtB7HYvG)\n\nI found my way to the only *currently in-development* entry on this list thanks to my Mastodon friend [wakest](https:\/\/social.wake.st\/@liaizon). iOS developer [Shadowfacts](https:\/\/social.shadowfacts.net\/users\/shadowfacts) (who also maintains [*shadowfacts.net*](https:\/\/shadowfacts.net\/)) is working on their considerate, distinct app, Tusker in [this self-hosted Repository](https:\/\/git.shadowfacts.net\/shadowfacts\/Tusker). In [#tusker](https:\/\/mastodon.social\/web\/timelines\/tag\/tusker) on Mastodon, you'll find a few poignant praises from [Pixelfed](https:\/\/pixelfed.org\/) founder and principal developer [Dan Sup](https:\/\/mastodon.social\/@dansup), which - from my perspective - are especially high, indeed. \n\n![Tusker Landscape Mode!](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/jZudSEdQ.png)\n\nTusker's color customization options are technically... well.. *not infinite*, like other apps here, but the end result of their (obviously, very considered) selection will be a net win for 100% of users over that alternative, I believe. It is definitely of a similar philosophy to Metatext, but unquestionably more ambitious. Out of the lot, testing Tusker was the singular instance in which I found myself considering a \"replacement\" for Toot! You, yourself can use Tusker *right this very minute* * via Apple's beta distribution system, [Testflight](https:\/\/testflight.apple.com\/), via [**this invite link**](https:\/\/testflight.apple.com\/join\/wtB7HYvG).\n\n![Roma for iOS](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/oBYO4T1e.png)\n\n### [Roma](https:\/\/apps.apple.com\/us\/app\/roma-for-pleroma-and-mastodon\/id1445328699)\n\nInstalling Roma for the first time led to a puzzling quest with a particularly pleasant end. I noticed fairly quickly that the iOS app was a re-branded release of what used to be Mast. My first instinct upon this discovery was to DM Mast's original developer, [Shihab Meboob](https:\/\/twitter.com\/JPEGuin), on Twitter, but frankly, I've already bothered him enough there over the years, so it's understandable that I didn't hear back. When I downloaded the desktop app I found on [Roma's web page](https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20220208022947\/https:\/\/www.roma.rocks\/) and noticed its similarity to [Whalebird](https:\/\/whalebird.social\/en\/desktop\/contents), I decided to use the site's contact form to [inquire](https:\/\/github.com\/extratone\/bilge\/blob\/main\/correspondence\/Roma%20Inquiry.md) about what exactly was going on as gingerly as I could. Happily, I received a reply just *minutes- later from Leo Radvinsky, head of [Leo.com](https:\/\/leo.com\/), \"a Florida-based boutique venture capital fund that invests in technology companies:\"\n\n> Hi David, \n>\n> In both cases we funded the original developers of both Mast and Whalebird to create a branded whitelabel app specially made for Pleroma. The idea was to make Roma a cross platform brand\/app. It didn't really work out so now we're working on a new app from scratch called Fedi for iOS and Android and releasing that as open source. \n>\n> https:\/\/play.google.com\/store\/apps\/details?id=com.fediverse.app&hl=en*US&gl=US \n>\n> https:\/\/apps.apple.com\/in\/app\/fedi-for-pleroma-and-mastodon\/id1478806281 \n>\n> I think Roma has been removed from the app stores as it's no longer supported. \n>\n> Let me know if you have any other questions\n\nThough my hopes for the original Mast to live on in Roma form were more or less dashed by this message, the suggestion that someone is investing **actual capital*- into federated social is certainly worth celebrating. If Roma is still available on the App Store as you're reading this, I insist you download it immediately. It represents an incredible and original attention to detail which should not simply be forgotten.\n\n![Fedi for iOS](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/4TO8CL5D.png)\n\n### [Fedi](https:\/\/apps.apple.com\/us\/app\/fedi-for-pleroma-and-mastodon\/id1478806281)\n\nNaturally, the app inheriting the work\/resources established by Mast and Roma - known by *Fedi- - should be next up for discussion. Hopefully, my relative lack of experience with [Pleroma](https:\/\/pleroma.social\/) - another ActivityPub-based, federated social network - won't let you down, here. After a brief shock from the uniqueness of Fedi's UI passes, one immediately notices how beautifully it is animated, wholly disregarding my [recently-acquired](https:\/\/twitter.com\/NeoYokel\/status\/1357394407201398791) preference for as little animation as possible. Perhaps more than any other app discussed here, Fedi feels uncannily bespoke in a way which iOS apps almost never do. It is undoubtedly the result of a very specific vision - to disregard the whole modern template for social apps and completely reimagine the archetype. Personally, I'm not sure if it would be easy to get used to, but my tastes\/habits in this regard are very much the result of the past decade of proprietary social apps' blandness. Going forward with substantial financial backing and the talents of whoever it was that got it this far, no doubt we should all have very high hopes for Fedi.\n\n![DUDU (嘟嘟) for iOS](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/Kt8ZbQFk.png)\n\n### [DUDU (嘟嘟)](https:\/\/bit.ly\/duduios) \n\nDUDU (or \"嘟嘟,\" which translates to \"Toot,\" appropriately,) definitely wins for *Cutest Iconography*. It's a non-English-native application with exceptional English support, which I personally appreciate very much. Compared the entries immediately above, DUDU represents a much more modest interpretation of what a Mastodon client can offer. It’s robust, free of over-animation, and - most distinctly - very *wide*, which might have something to do with the \"designed for iPad\" subtitle on its App Store Page.\n\n![Tootoise for iOS](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/AZ7fRWc7.png)\n\n### [Tootoise](https:\/\/apps.apple.com\/us\/app\/tootoise\/id1465090190)\n\nYet another \"Designed for iPad\" entry, Naoki Kuwata's [Tootoise](https:\/\/apps.apple.com\/us\/app\/tootoise\/id1465090190) is defined by its custom incoming post rate accommodations and its gorgeous Solarized theme. Its \"Max number of new arrival posts\" setting ranges from 0-400, allowing one to freeze their timeline entirely from any accidental (or habitual) Pulls to Refresh (set at 0,) load 400 Toots from such a gesture, or anything in between (at 40-Toot increments, anyway.) The advantages of this specification become immediately apparent when one actually begins to explore it, especially for those who have come to Mastodon after feeling overwhelmed by Big Social.\n\n![Stella for iOS](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/LzzNxqj9.png)\n\n### [Stella](https:\/\/apps.apple.com\/us\/app\/stella\/id921372048)\n\nYet another entirely one-of-a-kind experience, the slightly-mysterious Stella is listed as a \"Mastodon, Twitter & News Client,\" and is notably one of the two apps on this list which do indeed support Twitter! More than that, it is the first app I've seen in a very long time that allows one to *simultaneously- post to two separate social services (Twitter and Mastodon, in this case.) Without documentation, it's a bit clunky, but its customizable timelines feature also allows one to combine multiple \"sources\" (social accounts) into a single timeline.\n\n![B4X for Pleroma & Mastodon for iOS](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/aSYoZ8t2.png)\n\n### [B4X](https:\/\/apps.apple.com\/us\/app\/b4x-for-pleroma-mastodon\/id1538396871) \n\nB4X is yet another quite perplexing entry. The \"Developer Website\" link on its App Store Page leads to [b4x.com](https:\/\/www.b4x.com\/contact*us.html) - a web page entitled \"Anywhere Software.\" The GitHub icon in its footer led me to discover [a repository](https:\/\/github.com\/AnywhereSoftware\/B4X-Pleroma) which is labeled as such to lead one to believe it is, indeed, the development space for the iOS app we're discussing, but does not contain a single .swift or .pbxproj file - universally essential for iOS apps, as I understand it. Regardless, B4X appears to be built atop Anywhere Software's \"rapid application development tools.\" I like its elemental simplicity and nice 'n' wide post display.\n\n![Oyakodon for iOS](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/sFfxE4R7.png)\n\n### [Oyakodon](https:\/\/apps.apple.com\/us\/app\/oyakodon-for-mastodon\/id1229174544)\n\nIsao Takeyasu's [Oyakodon](https:\/\/apps.apple.com\/us\/app\/oyakodon-for-mastodon\/id1229174544) feels a bit like it originally began as a school project, and I mean that in the best possible sense. While it’s probably the least polished of the lot - and therefore likely the least viable candidate for the role of your primary, daily-driven Mastodon client - is is far from a throwaway application. Some evil component of Takeyasu’s mind was clearly let loose if only for a moment, for Oyakodon’s Facebook-style theme is reminiscent enough of Big Blue to alarm. The volume of its design definitely peaks in its Cute theme, which is so violently loud I could not help but extract its color palette to illustrate just how furious its creator must have been.\n\n![Oyakodon Cute Theme Palette](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/AFbihGYF.jpeg)\n\nTruly diabolical design, there. For better or worse, Oyakodon doesn’t really work very well in its current state, but it *does* work. \n\n![StarPterano for iOS](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/D34uONFT.png)\n\n### [StarPterano](https:\/\/apps.apple.com\/us\/app\/starpterano\/id1436972796)\nI very vaguely remember happening upon StarPterano in my very first moments on Mastodon, so finding it still published on the App Store - buried as it was - brought me a particular sort of joy. If I’m not mistaken, it holds a special personal accolade as the only iOS app which has caused me to involuntarily shriek. This might sound like an insult, but it is actually the peak of my praise. I believe my knowledge of iOS development safely allows me to suppose that StarPterano was built with complete disregard for any established UI element libraries. That is, the familiar toggles and buttons developers rely on to standardize the iOS experience were cast aside entirely in favor of handbuilt, translucent buttons of a sort of neon quality which call menus and text entry fields no less alien to the platform. The most astonishing bit, though, is that it *works*. On my 12 Pro Max, it’s exceptionally smooth, in fact.\n\n<audio controls>\n  <source src=\"https:\/\/davidblue.wtf\/audio\/starpterano.mp3\">\n<\/audio>\n\nI would imagine those *real* iOS developers among you should find [StarPterano’s GitHub Repository](https:\/\/github.com\/pgostation\/StarPterano-iOS5) particularly interesting, considering. In the interest of preservation, I have [forked it](https:\/\/github.com\/softwarehistorysociety\/StarPterano) as well, and fully intend to dive in to its code, one of these days. The audio player embedded above cites a three-second .mp3 file in the repository which perhaps once accounted for the “Sounds” toggle still found in the Settings menu of StarPterano’s current build. I couldn’t get the app to reproduce it, which is actually what set me on the hunt that led to the repo. \n\n![Ore2 for iOS](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/Ln2L96Qa.png)\n\n### [Ore2](https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20221109100758\/https:\/\/apps.apple.com\/us\/app\/ore2-for-twitter-mastodon\/id1107176601)\n\nOre2 is another (apparently) non-English-native Mastodon client focused on consolidating Mastodon and Twitter within a single space. Alongside Stella, it's the second of the first two apps I've come across in a very long time which allows one to post to both services simultaneously. Considerable work was obviously done on making its timeline-based tabs switchable with touch. Personally, I very much prefer my current crossposting configuration via [this (generously-public) web tool](https:\/\/crossposter.masto.donte.com.br), but I am all but certain those users exist who will find Ore2’s setup preferable. \n\n![tooot for iOS](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/b0GaeasV.png)\n\n### [tooot](https:\/\/apps.apple.com\/us\/app\/tooot\/id1549772269)\n\nInadvertently, I have saved the best story of the lot for last. Developer and researcher Zhiyuan Zheng documents both the narrative context leading up to the creation of his first app, [tooot](https:\/\/apps.apple.com\/us\/app\/tooot\/id1549772269), as well as the philosophy behind its design in “[Building my first app - toot](https:\/\/xmflsct.com\/2021\/tooot\/).” His reference to the downfall of a prominent social app in mainland China called Douban - and the “Douban Refugees”  which resulted - are alarmingly missing from all English news organizations save for [a single *Quartz* article](https:\/\/qz.com\/1726194\/the-decline-of-douban-an-online-sanctuary-for-chinas-liberals\/) from October 2019. He eludes to a “boom” of Mastodon adoption in the past few years and cites a lack of “user friendly mobile clients” which I can only assume to be a conundrum specific to China.\n\n“With the aim of contributing to the community and to this movement, I decided to take my quarantine time to build an enjoyable mobile client for Douban Refugees,” he explains. He notes that decentralized platforms have universally rejected algorithmic recommendation if for any other reason than “without centralized computing power, such [a] recommendation service is also not that feasible.” “Adapting” back to a linear timeline in a manner which still encourages exploration was clearly a major design consideration for tooot.\n\n> The core consists of 3 needs: 1) what I can read; 2) what I can write; 3) what I have done.\n\nObviously, I very much appreciate Zhiyuan writing publicly about his thoughts on decentralized social and sharing specific considerations in his app’s design and look forward to continued updates.\n\n## Get Bent, Big Social\n\nA few universal truths among these apps stand out as obligatory mentions. First - in comparison with their Proprietary, Big Social counterparts - they are all *ridiculously* **frugal**. Not a one weighs over 40mb, while minor (unexplained) updates to the official Twitter app [often exceed 100mb](https:\/\/twitter.com\/NeoYokel\/status\/1393294957352468494). They are all astonishingly **robust** - I did not experience a single crash in the course of normal testing these \"alt\" social apps - even from the beta builds - while I distinctly remember the official Twitter app crashing several times over this period, even after I deleted and reinstalled it (an accepted maintenance requirement for anyone using it heavily for its entire history.) Also, on the topic of the platform, itself, they are also made absurdly **interoperable** by the ActivityPub standard. My [PixelFed](https:\/\/pixelfed.social\/DavidBlue) posts show up seamlessly on their timelines among content from [Diaspora](https:\/\/diasp.org\/), [Pleroma](https:\/\/pleroma.social\/), and Mastodon, itself. \n\nhttps:\/\/twitter.com\/NeoYokel\/status\/1393294957352468494\n\nThe overwhelming impression I was left with after testing these apps was one of unwavering competence, cleverness, and true innovation. How many different ways can I possibly conjure forth in order to communicate this? I, David Blue - the vain fucker with a precollection for the most superficial variables of software design *so* healthy that I have on multiple occasions designed whole, years-long workflows around specific applications *entirely because of their available color palettes*... **It is I who requires you to take a good fucking look**, because this list of decentralized, largely open source, federated social software is a goddamned fashion show.\n\n## Continuing to Explore Social Ownership\n![Mastodon Account Wordcloud](https:\/\/user-images.githubusercontent.com\/43663476\/122717470-43f08a00-d231-11eb-890f-dfa3ff33b65d.png)\n\nThis couldn't be \"just\" an app guide - I think I have thoroughly accepted this, by now, just in time for some conclusionary remarks. Somehow, the subject I originally tackled specifically because I thought it would be quick, rudimentary, and straightforward has become yet another personal journey. It'd feel a bit preposterous to declare any one of these apps to be *life-changing*, but - in every sense of the term, in contemporary, inevitably social media-informed life, they do indeed constitute a form of radical, ideological wellness. Each of them managed to remind me of a different minute delight found within a developer-user dynamic made up of thoughtful and effective minds working to contribute original and valuable experiences, first. Most noteworthy of these little freedoms: the realization that the upcoming \"official\" Mastodon app along with any future new options are exclusively a positive thing *for the user*... None of these apps were conceived to gobble up market share because the market is fundamentally, inevitably, uncompromisingly *infinitely shared*. I don't know anything about business, but I *do* know that relief from the burden of considering proprietary multivectored development intentions has been personally breathtaking. I can only hope the reciprocal compensation is happening at even a fraction of what it \"should\" be. \n\nFrom another essential direction, I hope I have communicated that they're far from curious, \"niche\" or vanity side projects, now. When I used the term \"mature\" in introducing this little arena, I very much meant it - these \"alt\" social clients developed almost exclusively within single-person-led projects now make the Twitter for iOS app look ugly *and* fucking broken. \"Giving social networking back to you\" has never been more resonant. Yes, it really is Toot!'s \"take a break\" blue screen, Amaroq's mysterious Awoo mode toggle, iMast's music app integration, Mercury's configurable timelines, Metatext's native solidity, Tootle's custom colors, Tusker's Digital Wellness controls, DUDU's elemental readability, Roma's quiet resurrection of Mast's UI bravado, Stella's utterly bizarre visual departures, Fedi's odd animated UI behaviors, Tootoise's consideration of *pace*, B4X's unfathomable elements, Ore2's parallel timelines, tooot's development story, and Oyakodon's adorable rough edges that have made my online life *measurably*... *immensely* better, these past weeks. At the forefront of this perception is undoubtedly the comparatively extensive *control* over my social experience as a user offered by the diversity of mobile experiences these applications offer.\n\nThose of you who haven't yet signed up for Mastodon: ==you are missing the fuck out==. I am being *actually* pampered, now, in World Wide Web terms. You are [*so* welcome](https:\/\/bit.ly\/dbmastodon) whenever you're ready - the water is nice and warm, as they say.\n\n## ...Party One\n\n![Mastodon for iOS](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/sHTDx8AV.png)\n\nYes, you are looking at the currently in-development **\"*Official*\" Mastodon app on iOS**, coming very soon to the Awful App Store.

Essentially, Mastodon Commander-in-Chief Eugen Rochko and his team developed a whole, exceptional iOS app in the span of time it took me to write the [third-party Mastodon iOS app showcase](https:\/\/bilge.world\/mastodon-ios-apps) just before this item in *The Psalms*’ feed. If you’re new to this conversation, perhaps it’d be best to start in February of this year, with [Eugen’s announcement of the “official” Mastodon app’s development](https:\/\/blog.joinmastodon.org\/2021\/02\/developing-an-official-ios-app-for-mastodon\/) on the official Mastodon blog. “We need an official Mastodon app that is free to download and that is specialized in helping new users get started on the platform,” argues Eugen, in response to feedback indicating “the lack of an app that carries \\[Mastodon’s\\] name in the app stores trips up newcomers.” My first thought regarding the idea of an app *Specialized* in onboarding cynically jumped to the assumption that such a design choice would result in a less-than-ideal experience for those of us who already call Mastodon our home. However, as a [Patreon](https:\/\/patreon.com\/mastodon) supporter of the Mastodon Project, I’ve had the privilege of testing the final result for the past five weeks, and I can tell ya… It is so much more than that.\n\nhttps:\/\/youtube.com\/watch?v=bD8GQvNrE7E\n\n## Onboarding\n\nI’d like to offer the [demo video](https:\/\/youtu.be\/bD8GQvNrE7E) embedded above as an unusually succinct (from me) demonstration of the delightfully well-considered onboarding process. I would go so far as to declare it **the best all-around social network onboarding process currently available**. Having very recently slugged through the official Twitter app’s equivalent, the frames greeting new Mastodon users within this app are unbelievably exceptional.\n\n![Onboarding in Mastodon for iOS](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/P5oxTAg9.png)\n\nFirst, we’re presented with a list of Mastodon instances (servers,) organized by category. Those friends of mine to whom I’ve failed to “sell” Mastodon have cited server selection as a major obstacle of confusion and I can’t imagine a better means of addressing it than the tool offered by this app. It’s beautiful and fast in a way previous utilities - like [instances.social](https:\/\/instances.social) - cannot be, especially for those most lacking in attention. Once we’ve chosen a server, we are immediately presented up front with a clearly readable document containing the “ground rules” set by its administrators. In my experience, these rules tend to be notably **easy-to-understand** and **not open to interpretation**, as if they were written primarily in the interest of community wellness rather than to construct a defense from legal action.\n\nAfter we’ve agreed to the relevant terms of the server we’ve chosen, it’s on to account creation, which offers the options to which citizens of the social web have become accustomed - profile picture, username, email address, and password - but notably without the [inexplicable errors](https:\/\/gimletmedia.com\/shows\/reply-all\/n8hxzr7\/176-twicarus) exhibited for years in Big Social’s equivalent functions. Immediately following this frame, we are prompted to check our inboxes for a confirmation link. The explanation for my dramatic exclamation in the demo video comes down to Mastodon for iOS’ implementation of the operating system's intra-app linking function (with the syntax `mastodon:\/\/`,) which (in my experience) is hardly ever utilized correctly. The result is that I was able to click the incoming confirmation link within Outlook for iOS and then proceed *within the Mastodon app* instead of being bounced off to a web browser. This integration should not be remarkable, but - in the context of iOS development as it stands in 2021 - it most certainly is.\n\nAfter confirmation, we are offered the option to explore the app’s “Find people to follow” function, which is informed by \"a mix of most followed accounts and most-engaged-with accounts from recent times that post primarily in your language,\" as [Eugen explained](https:\/\/mastodon.social\/@Gargron\/106674282886448440) in response to an earlier draft of this post. Indeed, the remarkably relevant results offered to me in the demo were not actually remarkable at all: I just know a lot of folks on mastodon.online - especially those who post the most. That's the whole bit! If you need \"proof,\" [here is the finished result](https:\/\/mastodon.online\/@keys), but obviously, I would advise you download the app and try yourself. (It's a cliché, yes, but seriously... What do you have to lose?)\n\n![Trending & Profile Editing in Mastodon for iOS](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/F21Jm29Q.png)\n\n<!--more-->\n\n## Advantages\n\nOne of the distinctly missing functions among the breadth of third-party offerings has been the ability to edit one's profile information from within the app. Mastodon for iOS addresses this in a particularly visually impressive way (see image embedded above.) Some also have yet to be updated with support for Polls, which the new app encompasses in a manner that puts Big Social's equivalents to shame. The ability to vertically drag individual options in the compose interface, for instance, reflects insight only gained by *actually using these features*. The result is definitively the best means of crafting a Mastodon poll, for what that's worth.\n\n![Polling in Mastodon for iOS](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/NKHk8e1W.png)\n\n### Shortcuts\n\nAs of this writing, Mastodon for  iOS also includes Siri Shortcut support by way of a single action, entitled \"Post on Mastodon.\" Mostly in the interest of demonstration, I have created and published two Shortcuts around this action on RoutineHub:\n\n1. \"**[Mastodon Share](https:\/\/routinehub.co\/shortcut\/9776\/)**\" - a text-only Shortcut meant for the Share Sheet.\n\n2. \"**[Mastgur](https:\/\/routinehub.co\/shortcut\/9781\/)**\" - a more complicated Shortcut utilizing Imgur actions to get around the current Mastodon for iOS action's lack of multimedia support.\n\n![Siri Shortcuts for Mastodon for iOS](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/H212I22P.png)\n\nMastodon friend Emma's [customization of the latter](https:\/\/mstdn.cloud.themaymeow.com\/@emma\/106656610574981709) is a great example of how quickly one can tailor these (and all other) Siri Shortcuts to their own particular use.\n\n## Challenges\n\nAs of this writing, coverage of the app’s release amounted only to [a single news item from ](https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2021\/7\/30\/22602275\/mastodon-decentralized-social-network-official-ios-app-launches)*[The Verge](https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2021\/7\/30\/22602275\/mastodon-decentralized-social-network-official-ios-app-launches)*[’s Adi Robinson](https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2021\/7\/30\/22602275\/mastodon-decentralized-social-network-official-ios-app-launches), which notes the omission of local\/federated “firehose” timeline views out of a desire to “reduce the potential for conflict with Apple.” (see: the Inc.’s [blatantly inconsistent enforcement](https:\/\/litchie.com\/2021\/07\/idos2-will-be-gone) of its store policies in the past few months.) As a Mastodon user who *does* occasionally engage with my local and federated timelines, I find this decision reasonable considering the wellspring of third-party apps on iOS which *do* support said views and the app’s explicit focus on brand new, fragile users. My personal experience disagrees with Eugen’s description of these timelines as a suboptimal means of capital-D Discovery, however, considering I’ve found \\~70-80% of [the 600+ accounts I follow](https:\/\/github.com\/extratone\/bilge\/blob\/main\/curation\/mastodonfollowing.csv), there. (Though it should be noted that I *do not* represent any majority in my social media-specific preferences or behavior.)\n\nThough the onboarding process’ people to follow finder is pretty darn stellar, I worry that our hypothetical new user has a high chance of landing on a more-or-less empty timeline. (For many, I’m sure this would be a welcome relief, at least initially.) A well-limited Local timeline view, at least, might prove a valuable upcoming addition. Regardless, I am 100% positive these omissions from the *initial release* version of this iOS app do not constitute some new ideological opposition to the greater concept of Federation.\n\n![Composition Details in Mastodon for iOS](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/7UTf6Qyx.png)\n\nNaturally, a recurring complaint about the app is already surfacing in hashtag iOS on the Fediverse: [no multiple account support](https:\/\/mastodon.social\/@wiredfire\/106672087623244223)?! Perhaps you’ve already written me off as a mindless devotee, but - especially after exploring [the whole breadth of Mastodon apps available on iOS](https:\/\/github.com\/extratone\/mastodon-ios-apps) (all of which support multiple accounts) - the significance of this omission as a target for gripes seems laughably minuscule. Considering I have yet to delete any of the 20 apps I tested, I personally feel *pretty well covered* when it comes to checking my (embarrassingly numerous) alt accounts. It’d be one thing if longtime users\/powerusers were left wanting for available apps designed for us, but we have a more diverse, quality palette to choose from than any other social media protocol. To decry this app - which was explicitly designed from the very beginning for new users - for skipping a function offered by *more than a dozen alternatives* is patently absurd. If you’ve got multiple accounts you feel the need to check regularly, order them by frequency, authenticate all but number one in the free, dependable [Amaroq](https:\/\/apps.apple.com\/us\/app\/amaroq-for-mastodon\/id1214116200), and save Mastodon’s new app for your main.\n\n## Delights\n\nThe “relentless originality” I spoke of in my *third-party* showcase is no less exemplified in this first-party Mastodon app. Its color palette is a welcome departure from Tootsuite’s (the mother web application,) while still remaining definitively recognizable. The artwork dispersed throughout the app is adorable, as you’ve seen, and its bespoke audio player is without a doubt my favorite of such devices.\n\n![Mastodon for iOS Audio Player](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/IRzEOzXl.png)\n\nCustom audio notifications especially stood out among those third-party apps, so the project-sourced app’s inclusion of the iconic Mastodon “boop” is yet another small inclusion that adds a surprising amount of substance to the whole experience.\n\nThough quite specific to myself and the few other iPhone users who regularly command our handsets with physical keyboards, the Mastodon app’s inclusion of **Bluetooth keyboard shortcuts** provoked a moment of true euphoria when I first discovered them. As per my ‘*[iPhone and the Bluetooth Keyboard](https:\/\/github.com\/extrakeys)* project, I have bestowed upon Mastodon for iPhone semi-officially “our” Universal Clacker Award for its consideration of us “full keyboard-strapped cellular phone users.” (As of this writing, the award is just a “trophy.”)\n\n![Mastodon for iPhone - Universal Clacker Award](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/H7NjCvd7.png)\n\n### Mastodon for iOS Keyboard Shortcuts\n\n*Updated as of [release version 1.4.1](https:\/\/github.com\/mastodon\/mastodon-ios\/commit\/e4c38c70e29ea873b77312436845ddd7fc0ca7dd).* - `05182022-123850`\n\n*Please note that the list below includes view-dependent commands.*\n\n| **Action**                                    | **Command** |\n|:-----------------------------------------:|:-------:|\n| Previous                                  | K       |\n| Next                                      | J       |\n| Back                                      | H       |\n| Open                                      | L       |\n| Open Author’s Profile                     | P       |\n| Open Reblogger’s Profile                  | ⌥P      |\n| Reply to Post                             | ⌥ ⇧ N   |\n| Toggle Reblog on Post                     | R       |\n| Toggle Favorite on Post                   | F       |\n| Toggle Content Warning                    | O       |\n| Preview Image                             | I       |\n| Switch to Home                            | ⌘ 1     |\n| Switch to Search                          | ⌘ 2     |\n| Switch to Notifications                   | ⌘ 3     |\n| Switch to Profile                         | ⌘ 4     |\n| Compose New Post                          | ⌘ N     |\n| Show Favorites                            | ⌘ F     |\n| Open Settings                             | ⌘ ,     |\n| Previous Section                          | ⌘ ⇧ [   |\n| Next Section                              | ⌘ ⇧ ]   |\n| Discard Post                              | ⌘ W     |\n| Publish Post                              | ⌘ ⏎     |\n| Add Attachment - Browse                   | ⌥ ⌘ B   |\n| Add Attachment - Photo Library            | ⌥ ⌘ P   |\n| Add Attachment - Take Phoro               | ⌥ ⌘ C   |\n| Toggle Poll                               | ⇧ ⌘ P   |\n| Toggle Content Warning                    | ⇧ ⌘ C   |\n| Select Visibility - Public                | ⌘ 1     |\n| Select Visibility - Followers Only        | ⌘ 2     |\n| Select Visibility - Only people I mention | ⌘ 3     |\n| Paste                                     | ⌘ V     |\n| Paste and Match Style                     | ⌥ ⇧ ⌘ V |\n| Select All                                | ⌘ A     |\n\nAn important consideration to inform the perspective through which we analyze such an app, I’d argue, is that **this app could have been very bad**. Those who bewilderingly measure the success of social networking services\/protocols by their profit growth viability, alone, may well suggest it *should* have been bad. Had it been just mediocre, half-assed, and\/or full of bugs, I’m sure I would still have paused everything to write and publish this review. The reality, though, is nothing less than exceptional. Unlike some of the third-party examples I discussed, I would argue Mastodon for iPhone to be an “objectively” excellent piece of software in that I cannot imagine any one sort of iPhone user *not* finding it refreshing in some way.\n\nI would sincerely worry for the person who feels nothing at all from the artwork, the bespoke UI, or the general care exhibited in its craftsmanship, *but* they wouldn’t have exhausted reasons to use it. From the very first beta release I installed to the first release version pushed to the App Store just yesterday, the app has *never* crashed, and the single bug I encountered was documented and fixed before I had time to begin a feedback report. While Twitter’s official iOS app does include a few Siri Shortcuts actions, they are all made immediately useless by a universal command to open the app, itself. Remove the obsessive insistence that any\/all functions only be performed with your app in focus - even when it surely makes no difference to your ad tech mechanism - and you have Mastodon’s single action, “Show When Run” toggle included.\n\nI’m not sure what I expected from an “official” Mastodon app upon first reading that winter blog post, but what I’ve been delivered is quite a gem. Regardless of how its specific feature omissions may strike your ideological organ(s,) you cannot deny that great time and energy was invested in this app.\n\n![Mastodon for iOS QR Code](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/hqmcJQGx.jpg)\n\n## Notable Hyperlinks\n\n- The newly-publicized [GitHub Repository](https:\/\/github.com\/mastodon\/mastodon-ios)\n- The app’s [Product Hunt Page](https:\/\/www.producthunt.com\/posts\/mastodon-for-ios) (Congratulations on “#1 Product of the Day!”… I think?)\n- [The Mastodon Project Patreon page](https:\/\/www.patreon.com\/mastodon)\n- [Mastodon for Android](https:\/\/play.google.com\/store\/apps\/details?id=org.joinmastodon.android) has since been launched.

Considering the breadth of the mechanic's significance for other users, I have often been compelled to explain this to new followers. Recently, it occurred to me that a handy, brief explainer page might streamline this process, so I created \"[Why I Didn't Follow You Back](https:\/\/gist.github.com\/extratone\/8b762de50de414f8a4be05f9b0407fd8)\" - in both GitHub Gist and Medium post form. Other than a lack of reciprocity in engagement which I can only speculate to occur in the minds of the opposite parties involved in this dynamic, this limitation does not detract from my Twitter life, as I exclusively consume content in Twitter Lists (which I have spoken about extensively, elsewhere.)\n\nhttps:\/\/open.spotify.com\/episode\/4veXFMCFGgz0Fjnx7UBkpl\n\nA big theme in my 20s has been coming (slowly) to terms with the fact that I built my entire adult social life around a single, centralized social media Web Site. I mentioned this in [my Tweetbot 6 review](https:\/\/bilge.world\/tweetbot-6-ios-review), recently, but - as I also strive to be a more sincere person and spend more time adding value to *others*’ lives - I’ve concluded that it is the time now to speak as openly and vulnerably as I can about my “Social Media Methodology.” Most of the resulting insights will not be new information, but I continue to encounter greater and greater confusion in the face of my well-meaning behavior online and I have decided to stop disregarding it.\n\nThis is *not* an essay about how to “optimize” your social media use. It is - at least in part - a sort of manifesto against the very idea of designed online behavior beyond simply **being considerate** in a sense that predates even the spoken word. I, myself, have occupied a position well on the *chaotic* side of the spectrum. You could say I have been mostly *chaotic neutral* throughout my 12 years on Twitter thus far, and am actively working toward (and advocating for) *chaotic good*. Perhaps inevitably, I'm going to wade into some experiences with a few specific social media phenomena which I am particularly reacting to, here.\n\nhttps:\/\/twitter.com\/NeoYokel\/status\/753114804617932801\n\n## Assumptions at bat\n\n1. For the vast majority of mainstream social users, no amount of \\[insert vague overused marketing jargon noun\\] will *ever* result in a substantial accumulation of money\/\"influence\" (which seems to be the diluted zag of \"POWER\" of the moment.) Those interested in learning about \"marketing\" should know that no authority on the subject would ever tell you to *start* with Twitter - this I can say with certainty.\n\n2. Though Twitter was designed upon certain frameworks with certain rules which form quantifiable formulas where they are dependent upon a user's choices\/methodology to produce results which we *have*, indeed, become more adept at predicting with study over time, it was *not* created as a *game to be won*. Perhaps more importantly, the \"prize\" of \"winning\" in the sense held by those who resist this assumption (notoriety, \"influence,\" relevance) has continued to prove ultimately worthless (or worse) time and time again throughout the very short history of the cultural element as it exists today.\n\n3. If both 1 and 2 pass scrutiny, the only remaining reasonable prerogatives in one’s social media use is to engage with *both* strangers and friends in a manner which generally **adds value to the lives of all involved**.\n\n4. 3 is not only *possible* - it is easily *reproducible*. Most of my evidence is centered around my own experiences, but I believe - if I took the time - I would be able to find infinitely many publicly-facing examples.\n\n5. Though I am going to use my own methods to demonstrate 4, **neither my ideas nor my behavior are the only means of interacting positively on social media**.\n\nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=7A-Gzn0wu3Q\n\nI've come to the conclusion fairly recently that I need to become brutally frank about the discrepancies I've observed between others' accounts of their social media use and my own as soon as possible. The great, ambient grousing summoned throughout The Plague from even the first picogeneration to be born *directly* into The Social Web really challenged my assumptions about its *actual purpose* in the day-to-day lives of those in the center of the adoption curve. *You mean to tell me you've been spending all that societally-alarming time on your phone... On social media services... and you haven't made a single international friend? Or happened across a single niche community surrounding some bizarre practice or knowledge you'd long thought you were entirely alone in? What exactly have you being doing with all that tapping since your toddlerhood, then?* I had absolutely no clue how utterly *ineffective* the vast majority of n̳o̳r̳m̳i̳e̳s̳ still are at using social media for its general purpose in the most abstract sense: \"*human connection.*\"\n\nThe essential realization toward which (I desperately hope) the largesse of America is being carried by conversations around *[An Ugly Truth](https:\/\/www.harpercollins.com\/pages\/anuglytruth)*, as well as countless lower-profile essays, features, academic papers, and general shit shooting is that the responsibility for this ignorance rests *solely* on the platforms who systematically reformed the controls originally handed over by default to early adopters like me. I would love (for both selfish and very humanitarian reasons) to be able to proclaim some precious, one-of-a-kind genius as the sole differentiator between my complete confidence in my ability to design and maintain social software configurations that have kept my online consumption *entirely* free of unwanted encounters and the amount of regular involuntary bullshit I hear described in the day-to-day online existence of everyone around me. The truth, I suspect, involves my being of the most privileged category of human in Western civilization combined with the group of high school friends who adopted and socialized me. (A story for another permalink, certainly, if not my equivalent of *Trick Mirror*.)\n\n\\~\\~More importantly, perhaps, I don't think I can recall a single instance of sincere malice from within myself toward anyone who'd actually converse with me. On the occasions I have been all huffy and confrontational, I do not remember a single example in which I was unwittingly ejected from a conversation left feeling *unsatisfied*.\\~\\~\n\nOver the past few months, I've started a few Posts for this blog regarding Twitter, its properties, and its recent feature addition frenzy which I'll probably never finish. I finished the first and narrowest one - the aforelinked Tweetbot 6 review - but the (debatably) most important one - highlighting how irresponsibly and distastefully [Twitter butchered Periscope and built Spaces atop its technology](https:\/\/github.com\/extratone\/bilge\/issues\/79) - would make less and less sense as time goes on. I definitely got caught up in the \"death\" of the live video streaming service, fueled by my now quite old desire to celebrate it, which I will hopefully accomplish *eventually* in a very sentimental essay. If I can successfully link them editorially, the subject encompassing Spaces - social audio's \"moment\" - would also include mention of RSS, \"Podcasting\" (the term describing the medium,) Spotify, and Clubhouse, inevitably. Instead of counting on my future self entirely, however, I'm going to begin by discussing that last one.\n\n![Clubhouse Blasted Logo](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/hf2fIH9M.png)\n\n## The (‽‽‽th) Social Audio Renaissance\n\nExactly one month ago, I finally [broke into Clubhouse](https:\/\/www.joinclubhouse.com\/@davidblue) thanks to a random kind stranger on Twitter who preferred not to be named. April 25th was the first time I set eyes on the app - though I could've (and usually would've) looked up screenshots and\/or browsed the litter of how tos available, I did not. By this time, I'd accumulated quite a bit of experience with Twitter Spaces - derided universally by tech media as a \"Clubhouse clone\" - and therefore assumed the original would be \"better,\" at least in pure feature terms. What I found, however, was even *less* evidence that anyone building Clubhouse has been\/is\/intends to be a regular Clubhouse user. Spaces, at least, included five emoji reacts for listeners from the beginning:  💯✊✌️👋😂. Clubhouse's exclusive means of Listener-Host interaction is Hand Raising, which is essentially requesting to speak, even though the hand waving emoji is *[literally featured in their logo](https:\/\/joinclubhouse.com\/press)*. (The fact that neither have thought to add 🙌 is absolutely inexcusable\/inexplicable.)\n\nhttps:\/\/twitter.com\/NeoYokel\/status\/1344473573226762241\n\nIn case you weren't aware, I appear to enjoy trying out new social services. My password manager is full of literally thousands of credentials for social media apps\/services\/startups - most of which have undoubtedly collapsed or been absorbed by a larger entity. Since generating said credentials has become such an easy process, especially, I tend to immediately sign up for an account on just about every one I hear about. (I even have [a Parler profile](https:\/\/parler.com\/#\/user\/Extratone) I cannot bear to actually look at.) Generally, I sign up, follow anyone I know from elsewhere if given an account-bridging option, poke around enough to figure out whether or not the service in question could add something to my online existence, and end up leaving for good. Most of these services are *not* unique in any way, to a perplexing degree. A few - like Pinterest - gain success separately as I give up on trying to integrate them into my life. The miniscule remaining percentage, though, end up becoming a part of my daily existence. The most *recent* of these dates back to April 2017, when I first discovered [Mastodon](https:\/\/bilge.world\/eugen-rochko-interview).\n\nhttps:\/\/twitter.com\/0kbps\/status\/1393792313936146433\n\n### The Feature Story\n\n\"Social Audio\" did not begin with Clubhouse. Anchor originally launched as a \"[public radio](http:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20160209224846\/https:\/\/anchor.fm\/about)\" app, believe it or not. *Extratone*'s channel was actually the [first to be featured](https:\/\/www.patreon.com\/posts\/archived-our-day-11592398) in their Music section, once upon a time. Frankly, that happening was the most positive outcome of my social media service accumulation habit. More recently, [Stereo](https:\/\/stereo.com\/davidblue) launched, describing themselves as \"[the premier LIVE broadcast social platform that enables people to have and discover real conversations in real time](https:\/\/stereo.com\/about).\" Bizarrely, the most legitimate media coverage I could find of Stereo was [from ](https:\/\/www.glamourmagazine.co.uk\/article\/stereo-app)*[Glamour UK](https:\/\/www.glamourmagazine.co.uk\/article\/stereo-app)*, and its author definitely spent less than a day actually using the service. Adam Corolla remains #1 on its earnings leaderboard and its [conversation export feature](https:\/\/youtu.be\/0GfGLUbc6fw) is a personal favorite. The [Big ](https:\/\/www.wired.com\/story\/the-future-of-social-media-is-all-talk)*[WIRED](https:\/\/www.wired.com\/story\/the-future-of-social-media-is-all-talk)*[ feature on the subject](https:\/\/www.wired.com\/story\/the-future-of-social-media-is-all-talk) from December of last year does not mention Stereo but lists three other \"alternatives:\" [Wavve](https:\/\/wavve.co\/), [Riffr](https:\/\/riffr.com\/), and [Spoon](https:\/\/www.spooncast.net\/). (None of which are actually competitors\/alternatives. Sorry, Arielle.)\n\nhttps:\/\/twitter.com\/NeoYokel\/status\/1388936080645312520\n\nI probably shouldn't proclaim to be an authority on social audio, but I am definitely a veteran. From that context, I must say that Clubhouse is horribly unoriginal - not only in the sense that \"successful\" business implementations of others', previous ideas tend to be diluted versions of the original, but almost pitifully so. I will commend the app's developers on their somewhat-thorough release notes (even though they can be viewed only when first opening the app after an update instead of *in the designated space on the App Store*,) but the extent of *linkable* Clubhouse documentation amounts to [eight blog posts](https:\/\/joinclubhouse.com\/blog) and a \"[Community Guidelines](https:\/\/www.notion.so\/Community-Guidelines-461a6860abda41649e17c34dc1dd4b5f)\" Notion page. Though I've only been a user for one month, I wonder what the fuck they've been doing since launch, given how sparsely-featured the app is at this moment. There are Notifications, Profiles, and Clubs - the latter of which cannot be created until a user surpasses an unknown threshold of renown(?) on the app. Competent calendar integration may be the service's singular innovation, though support for Outlook has yet to be added. The Big Issue, though, is finding a \"talk\" to attend that will not drive you utterly insane...\n\n![Clubhouse Bullshit](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/RypjcP6M.png)\n\n### The Grand Delusion\n\nI wrote the assumptions at the beginning of this Post in a single go after [a particularly icky Sunday Clubhouse experience](https:\/\/twitter.com\/neoyokel\/status\/1388930367671910404) out of a deep concern that'd been growing since first exploring the app. The content I've found there is not at all what I expected, to be honest. I've found it almost entirely indecipherable, which makes critique beyond [just fucking screaming](https:\/\/twitter.com\/NeoYokel\/status\/1388936080645312520) difficult. *The New Yorker*'s Anna Wiener did a much better job than I could realistically manage in \"[Clubhouse Feels like a Party](https:\/\/www.newyorker.com\/news\/letter-from-silicon-valley\/in-the-clubhouse):\"\n\n> There was something pleasant about meandering from conversation to conversation, as if I had walked into my own home to find a conference in full swing. But I also wondered, Why did I let all of these people into my house?\n>\n> ...\n>\n> It is hard to shake the feeling that everyone on Clubhouse is selling something: a company, a workshop, a show, a book, a brand.\n\nMore recently, her publication's nemesis declared \"[The Clubhouse Party is Over](https:\/\/www.vanityfair.com\/news\/2021\/04\/the-clubhouse-party-is-over),\" but I wouldn't know. None of my friends have ever Tweeted a Clubhouse link (determinable via [this Twitter search](https:\/\/twitter.com\/search?q=%22joinclubhouse%22&src=typed_query&f=live&pf=on).) Very few of the tech industry celebrities I follow have, either - pretty much just [Chris Messina](https:\/\/twitter.com\/chrismessina) and [Jason Calacanis](https:\/\/twitter.com\/Jason). This is noteworthy because I believe [my list of followed accounts on Twitter](https:\/\/twitter.com\/NeoYokel\/following) to be particularly diverse. I actively followed accounts across my various interests from ages 15-25 (when I hit my [follow limit](https:\/\/bit.ly\/dbfollow)) and basically *never unfollowed anyone*. I would imagine there are several accounts within that list which I would be ashamed to be associated with, now, and yet none have shared a Clubhouse link. Reading any further into this observation would require actual data journalism, which I'll leave to the pros. It does prompt the question, though: if nobody I've ever known or been interested in on Twitter is using Clubhouse, *who* in fuck *is*?\n\nFrankly, I do not understand the business incentive behind the massive duplication of other software\/services defining featuresets of late. I see that Instagram stories have eclipsed Snapchat's in terms of [sheer user count](https:\/\/money.cnn.com\/2018\/06\/28\/technology\/instagram-stories-users\/index.html), but I do not understand why its leaders would choose to fuck their legacy by such blatant idea theft, much less why [Twitter](https:\/\/blog.twitter.com\/en_us\/topics\/product\/2020\/introducing-fleets-new-way-to-join-the-conversation.html), [Facebook](https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2017\/03\/28\/facebook-launches-stories-in-the-main-facebook-app), [Patreon](https:\/\/blog.patreon.com\/lens\/) and even fucking [LinkedIn](https:\/\/www.inputmag.com\/culture\/nobody-wants-stories-on-their-linkedin-feed) have implemented nearly-identical featuresets. Though I know Ben Thompson's word on these matters should be easily digestible, I haven't been able to actually take a bite. For the End User, especially, I cannot even begin to conceive of what the leaders behind these decisions imagine the day-to-day experience of the average social media user looks like in the near future. *How many apps* am I going to cycle through to get a single story-type piece of content satisfactorily shared? Personally, I currently use three, and sharing a single bit individually across all of them one-by-one (since the current state of APIs is not conducive to consumer-targeted mass-sharing tools) makes me feel utterly insane.\n\nhttps:\/\/youtube.com\/watch?v=7uFR_bSxhTg\n\nMy lack of understanding would be meaningless if it were not so widely shared among my peers - young, brilliant, multifaceted, and distinctly original creators who (in large part) make stuff on the internet full-time. *They* are who I'd actually plan ahead to hear from in a live broadcast setting like Clubhouse or Twitter Spaces, but Twitch seems to do just fine. For audio broadcasts, specifically, the *hip*, fresh sources which come to mind are all distinctly Open Web: [Datafruits.fm](https:\/\/datafruits.fm\/), [Solarpunk.cool](https:\/\/solarpunk.cool\/magic\/computer\/club\/), [Poolside.fm](http:\/\/poolside.fm\/), and my Mastodon friend [Vanta's stream](https:\/\/radio.schizoid.tech\/). The potential of the term \"social audio\" is truly being explored by projects like [Rave.DJ](https:\/\/www.patreon.com\/RaveDJ) - a homegrown, Patreon-funded service for sharing mixes\/mashups. On a smaller scale, the sky is the limit for [Whyp.it](https:\/\/whyp.it\/) as a pure audio playback\/annotation tool for creators (as developed by Brad Varol, whom I [interviewed in March](https:\/\/lnns.co\/ZSadwt3Hnfi).)\n\nCompared to these, most of Clubhouse's communities seem bleak at best. As I may or may not get around to arguing thoroughly about Twitter Spaces, these services' fundamental, near-complete disinterest in **Discovery** of new voices and their subsequent servitude to only their most popular users should be extremely worrying for us all - including those who benefit most.\n\n![Tinder Obfuscation](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/DhF352N3.png)\n\n## The Consequences of Strategy\n\nI have more than my fair share of stories and peeves about dating apps. On several occasions, for instance, I have corrected those who cite Tinder as the origin of the directional swiping interface, explaining that it was actually the now-defunct service Hot or Not who did so some 15 years ago. (Why on Earth I am compelled to do so, nobody knows. Not even God.) Somehow, though, I think most of us can agree that Tinder is the *least shitty* of the explicitly hookup-ish spectrum of the genre. Or at least, I thought so, until I happened to spy the \"Photo Tip\" embedded above beneath a preview of my profile on the iOS app.\n\n<!--more-->\n\nThe innocuousness of this advice, which surely would not be dispensed in *any* other context without immediately screaming malice, has been on my mind ever since. It is not the devil who tells you to make sure a passing potential match doesn't immediately learn you have children, but the Marketing Man. (Yes, they are distinct. I would explicitly discourage that particular sort of demonization, mostly because it has proven completely ineffective as cultural critique.) I am in no position to relevantly explore the topic of Society & Sex, generally, other than to insist that most people on Tinder *in my area*, at least, are not looking to *leverage* it *for the dick*. They are looking for dates, and a good many are working class single mothers. To be clear, I’m not trying to suggest anyone in this demographic would be “fooled” by such a suggestion. Offended, perhaps, and\/or activated in such a way that would lead to them replacing all of their profile’s pictures with photos of *just* their children. Regardless, this social group defined by a distinct lack of free time, if nothing else, represents an antithesis to the practice of *optimizing* one’s *swipe ratio.*\n\nI think I’ll stop there with this *Chapter of David Blue’s Tech \\~\\~Gripes\\~\\~ Grapes* and pledge to arrive back again exclusively through haphazard\/unintentional means, if I ever do.\n\n<!--comment-->\n\n#media #social","views":973,"updated":"2024-01-22T23:24:16Z","tags":["social","media"],"type":null,"title":"Against All Strategic Social","slug":"social-media-strategy","appearance":"norm","language":"en","rtl":false,"created":"2021-08-09T21:01:05Z","images":["https:\/\/i.snap.as\/RypjcP6M.png","https:\/\/i.snap.as\/DhF352N3.png","https:\/\/i.snap.as\/vopPn5mt.png","https:\/\/i.snap.as\/hf2fIH9M.png"],"collection":{"public":false,"alias":"bilge","total_posts":0,"title":"The Psalms","verification_link":"","description":"A <a href=\"https:\/\/davidblue.wtf\/db.vcf\">narcoleptic yokel<\/a> on software and culture.","style_sheet":"","views":177027,"monetization_pointer":""},"paid":false},{"id":"v3o6lf9gunaivi3d","body":"![Siri Speech Synthesis Banner](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/8ZsLlxLp.png)\n\n## Bewilderingly, Siri is genuinely great at something they were never designed for. The new “Make Spoken Audio From Text” action has finally been fixed.\n\n<!--more-->\n\n<audio controls>\n  <source src=\"https:\/\/davidblue.wtf\/audio\/SiriTTSTalent.mp3\">\n<\/audio>\n\nWhen I first published my [iPhone & Music guide](https:\/\/bilge.world\/iphone-ios-music-apps) this past April, I’d been pretty active in *[AppleScoop](https:\/\/discord.gg\/DxQ9jry8J3)*[’s Discord Server](https:\/\/discord.gg\/DxQ9jry8J3), so I decided to share it there. Editor-in-Chief Flynn - a ridiculously talented web developer *and* successful independent media entrepreneur - responded “I’m listening to it with the speak feature right now. Is it your voice or someone else? 😛,” Gourd bless his soul. Here’s the specific audio he was talking about:\n\nOf course, I am not a young black man, nor am I even remotely as adept at [reading my own work aloud](https:\/\/bilge.world\/why) as the actual talent, Siri Voice 3, who should be available on your iPhone\/iPad right this moment (as long as you’ve updated iOS in the past six months,) via `Settings ⇨ Siri & Search ⇨ Siri Voice`. (For more details, see [this Apple Support page](https:\/\/support.apple.com\/guide\/iphone\/change-siri-settings-iphc28624b81\/ios).)\n\n<!--more-->\n\n![New Siri Voices - iOS 14.5](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/1f7argcU.png)\n\nOf the four new Siri voices introduced earlier this year in iOS 14.5, 2 and 3 are by far my favorites, not just because of their [resonance with black iPhone users](https:\/\/www.consumerreports.org\/digital-assistants\/apples-new-siri-voices-resonate-with-some-black-iphone-users\/), but because they’re just *better* in a sense which I believe to be very significant.\n\nhttps:\/\/youtube.com\/watch?v=DkS5SYbsEW4\n\nBefore I get ahead of myself, though, I must acknowledge that I am not the first to invest in Siri as a text-to-speech generator. In 2019, [Adam Tow](https:\/\/twitter.com\/atow) released an immensely well-considered Siri Shortcut called “[Record Text to Speech](https:\/\/tow.com\/shortcuts\/record-text-to-speech\/),” which provides an interface for recording, editing, and managing text-to-speech audio files with Siri’s original voices. A testament to its robustness: it *still works* perfectly on my handset running iOS 15 Dev Beta 6 despite having not been updated since [March of last year](https:\/\/routinehub.co\/shortcut\/2506\/).\n\n<!--more-->\n\n![Old Siri TTS Shortcuts](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/I0Yh0jNn.png)\n\nI must admit that I found Adam’s shortcut more of a full *application* than a speedy personal automation, with its full interactive UI menu and darn near *800 actions*, so I made my own set of shortcuts based on the same idea - using iPhone’s native screen recording feature to capture audio of Siri reading aloud - and varying only by input (manual text input, getting text from a file, or simply reading text from the clipboard.) I’d then send the resulting screen recording in its original video format to my PC, where I’d drop it in [Audacity](https:\/\/www.audacityteam.org), in which I’d run [a simple macro](https:\/\/github.com\/extratone\/bilge\/blob\/main\/configuration\/Audacity\/TruncatenAmpMacro.txt) on the audio that truncates silence and amplifies the result so that the loudest point touches the rails. Then, I’d export it, pass it through [Mp3Tag](https:\/\/www.mp3tag.de\/en\/) to perfect its metadata, and finally push the end-result .mp3 file to [a folder in ](https:\/\/github.com\/extratone\/bilge\/tree\/main\/audio\/TTS)*[The Psalms](https:\/\/github.com\/extratone\/bilge\/tree\/main\/audio\/TTS)*[ GitHub Repository](https:\/\/github.com\/extratone\/bilge\/tree\/main\/audio\/TTS). (I’ll show you how to embed a web-bound audio file with its direct URL in a webpage in the guide below.) This example was made using this method, but with Siri’s original United States English Voice (for [my Tweetbot 6 review](https:\/\/bilge.world\/tweetbot-6-ios-review):)\n\n<!--more-->\n\nPerhaps you’ll agree with me that this process *does the job* in functional\/accessibility terms, and does so quite well considering how much one would pay to generate the same sort of audio file using Google’s Cloud Platform or IBM’s Watson. Crucially, though, this original voice was not one I could listen to at any length. Siri Voices 2 and 3, however, I *can*. From my perspective, this means they have crossed a **very significant threshold** which I find vastly more meaningful than just about all of those in the current discourse. Not only can I tolerate them… I genuinely *enjoy* listening to super-long magazine features read aloud by Siri Voice 2, especially, and I believe I would regardless of the quite serious crush I’ve developed on them.\n\nhttps:\/\/twitter.com\/neoyokel\/status\/1387809776072015873\n\nUnfortunately, using the methods we’ve discussed so far with the new Siri voices is inconvenient, very hit-or-miss, and quite buggy. If you scrub ahead toward the last third or so of the second audio player in this post (after the post’s own,) you’ll hear Siri Voice 2 start to bug out in very amusing ways. Since Apple makes changes to Siri Shortcuts between releases without any public documentation, none of them have ever been reliable enough to write this guide. (For the past 6+ weeks at least, it’s been too broken to be usable.) *However*, for whatever reason, Apple created a dedicated spoken audio generation action for Siri Shortcuts in iOS 15, called “Make Spoken Audio From Text.”\n\n![Make Spoken Audio From Text Action - iOS 15](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/MkHTYMkF.jpeg)\n\nFor the entirety of iOS 15’s Beta cycle up until Developer Beta 6’s release, this past Tuesday, this action has been [hilariously broken](https:\/\/mastodon.social\/users\/DavidBlue\/statuses\/106580821087349299), but as soon I discovered it’d been fixed (which was not mentioned whatsoever in [Apple’s official release notes](https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/documentation\/ios-ipados-release-notes\/ios-ipados-15-beta-release-notes),) I immediately began composing this dang Post.\n\n<!--more-->\n\n---\n\n![Make Audio from Article Body 1.1](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/RAxa0Id6.png)\n\n# Guide\n\nSo! For those of you currently running the latest iOS 15 Beta and those in the future running the full release, **what follows is a guide on how you can use my own shortcuts and methods to generate, metadate, and embed Siri-powered audio text-to-speech files relatively quickly without having to use desktop-class (or any other) hardware**.\n\n![TTS Shortcuts Compared](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/P0yJJyUc.png)\n\nTo begin, you should install two brand new shortcuts of mine: **[Make Audio from Article Body](https:\/\/routinehub.co\/shortcut\/9953\/)** and (if you intend to stick with me to the embed stage, anyway,) my [< audio > Embed Tool](https:\/\/routinehub.co\/shortcut\/9948\/). Both should function out of the box, but I would highly encourage that you try building your own shortcut around the `Make Spoken Audio From Text` action, even if you've never worked with Shortcuts (or any sort of automation, for that matter) before, *especially* if you plan to be using Siri as a text-to-speech generator with any frequency.\n\nhttps:\/\/youtube.com\/watch?v=5yZB7OC8Vgk\n\n### Intended Result\n\nThroughout this guide, I'm going to be using [a five-year-old ramble of mine](https:\/\/bilge.world\/johnny-tsunami-smart-house-slavery) about the oddly-perceptive bits found in early-oughts Disney movies as example text. Earlier today, I used my own personalized version of my new shortcut to generate an example of in which the process we're about to explore should result. The \\~6000 words of text took just over 3 minutes, 30 seconds to render consistently in three consecutive timed attempts. You can listen to it [on Whyp](https:\/\/whyp.it\/t\/johnny-tsunami-vi-separate-but-equal-siri-voice-2-tts-74752) and\/or inspect [the actual file](https:\/\/github.com\/extratone\/bilge\/raw\/main\/audio\/TTS\/JohnnyTsunami.m4a) yourself, if you'd like.\n\n![Plain Text Parsed by Safari](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/dktmGQQb.png)\n\n### Input Format\n\nIf we were trying to do this using any other available method in 2021 - even the expensive ones - our first task would be scrubbing our subject text of any special formatting (Word,) symbols, embed, hyperlinks, and any other data Siri doesn't understand (roman numerals, for example.) As a Windows user who's not at all new to free ways to automate accessibility improvements to web content, I envy both you and my new self for the magic available to us in the form of Safari's abilities to parse complex web content. In my experience, there's nothing like it (at least nothing available to regular consumers.)\n\nThe screenshot embedded above shows the result of a `Quick Look` action inserted just after the `Text` action produced by the public version of my shortcut when run on our example. There are three immediately problematic issues:\n\n1. Siri doesn't understand roman numerals, so she will read \"Johnny Tsunami VI\" as *Johnny Tsunami vee eye*.\n\n2. \"The Psalms\" is not my name, though it is what this blog currently returns when asked for a byline. In my experience, this generally isn't an issue with most mainstream media CMSs.\n\n3. The shortcut appears to have failed to retrieve any data for the `Published Date` variable from my blog. (Also a relatively specific consideration.)\n\nIf you'll note in the *previous* embedded image comparing my custom version of the shortcut (left) to the published version (right,) you'll note that my chosen solution is to manually input all metadata before actually starting the shortcut. What's not shown is my corresponding manual inputs in the `Encode Trimmed Media` action, which includes attaching a retrieved image file (in the Working Copy action you *can* see) as album art. For my intended use - exclusively generating text-to-speech audio of Posts on this blog - this makes more sense than unnecessarily automating metadata retrieval.\n\nThe extraordinary thing about the screenshot, though, is that it doesn't contain any of the other crap (as described above) found in the original page. (Beforehand, it looked more [like this](https:\/\/raw.githubusercontent.com\/extratone\/bilge\/main\/posts\/johnny-tsunami-smart-house-slavery.md).) It's especially reliable at parsing WordPress-bound content, which still makes up \\[s̵͕̈́͊c̶̥̏̚r̶̥͈̃è̴̙͌å̴̹m̵̛̅ͅi̶̦̾͘n̸͎̟̎̃g̶͎͛\\] percent of the whole web. **Treasure this power**, folks.\n\n![Simpler TTS Examples](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/OMwKdOUI.png)\n\nIf all you need read aloud is the body text, things become even simpler. In the right example above, I've simply deleted the `Text` action and replaced it with `Get text from [the Safari Web Article's body]`. Theoretically, one could omit that action, even, and simply use the direct output of `Get Body from Article` as input for the `Make spoken audio from text` action, but I say keep the extra step unless it becomes an issue.\n\n**If you're actually *beginning* with clean plain text** and don't care about metadata in your final audio file and\/or if you're planning on passing the result through other audio\/metadata editing software, anyway, the left, three-action shortcut is all you need. It will result in a [Core Audio Format (.caf)](https:\/\/www.wikiwand.com\/en\/Core_Audio_Format) file (like [this one](https:\/\/github.com\/extratone\/bilge\/blob\/main\/audio\/egg.caf),) which I know absolutely nothing about except that Audacity and GarageBand support it by default.\n\n### Sharing\/Embedding\n\nWhichever route you traveled, you should have some sort of audio file, at this point, and if you intend to share and\/or embed it, you’ll need to upload said audio to some sort of Web Server which allows direct playback\/download of the raw file from external sources. Unless you’ve been skimming, you know by now that I’ve been using *[The Psalms](https:\/\/github.com\/extratone\/bilge)*[ GitHub Repository](https:\/\/github.com\/extratone\/bilge) to do this thus far, though one isn’t really supposed to. Every few months, someone on Stack Overflow figures out how to construct or discover the raw link to a given Google Drive file before Google notices and alters it, and I’m afraid you’ll find just about every other cloud\/file sharing service in a similarly unreliable situation. If it’s going to be done at scale, I’m afraid it’s ultimately going to require you rent regular, vanilla space on an FTP-enabled fileserver, if one can still do that sort of thing. (I will update this post if\/when I find a more ideal solution.)\n\nWithin my current system, the raw URL to our example file looks like this:\n\n```\nhttps:\/\/github.com\/extratone\/bilge\/raw\/main\/audio\/TTS\/JohnnyTsunami.m4a\n```\n\nUsing my aforelinked, ultra rudimentary [< audio > element Siri Shortcut tool](https:\/\/routinehub.co\/shortcut\/9948\/) (which I’ve kept on my homescreen with good results for a few months,) we can very quickly turn said raw URL into a properly-formatted HTML5 audio player:\n\n```\n<audio controls>\n  <source src=\"https:\/\/github.com\/extratone\/bilge\/raw\/main\/audio\/TTS\/JohnnyTsunami.m4a\">\n<\/audio>\n```\n\nIdeally, on the final, reader-facing page, said code should create a player like this:\n\n<!--more-->\n\nIf further configuration of the player is desired or necessary, see [this Mozilla page](https:\/\/developer.mozilla.org\/en-US\/docs\/Web\/HTML\/Element\/audio) for a full list of supported options. Obviously, there are a few older methods of embedding audio players, but I am neither qualified nor interested in exploring them. If you’re in a frustrating bind, I recommend [signing up for my CMS](https:\/\/bit.ly\/extwa). (Just try it, okay?)\n\n### Pwoof\n\nFor the sake of bare minimum sample variety, I ran Version 1.0 of the public Make Audio from Article Body shortcut on an article hosted not on WordPress, nor my own CMS, but on Bustle’s ultra-slick, totally-bespoke system (which [began as ](https:\/\/www.codeandtheory.com\/things-we-make\/the-outline)*[The Outline](https:\/\/www.codeandtheory.com\/things-we-make\/the-outline)*, FYI.) I chose the first permalink I saw in one of its “regular” article formats - not a long feature, nor one of their touch-targeted slideshows.\n\n“[OnlyFans is banning porn, the very thing that made it big](https:\/\/www.inputmag.com\/tech\/onlyfans-is-banning-porn-the-very-thing-that-made-it-big)” is an 870-word newsy piece written by Tom Maxwell, who is the only New York Media person ever to accept my Facebook friend request. (Thanks again, Tom.) Without any tweaking, I was able to run the shortcut (from within the Shortcuts app since the Share Sheet appears to be thoroughly fucked at the moment) in a reasonable amount of time - less than 5 minutes, more than 2 - and generate the file embedded below. Notably, I also used a different hosting service - [mastodon.social](https:\/\/mastodon.social\/web\/statuses\/106798701662102859) - but I certainly don’t plan on doing so at scale and neither should you.\n\n<!--more-->\n\nHonestly, *Input*’s CMS is the cleverest challenge I was able to come up with for this single-day-old shortcut of mine, and I’m quite proud of the result. Though it wasn’t able to retrieve a timestamp, it correctly retrieved the article’s title and byline without fuss and even managed to scrape and attach said article’s featured image as the file’s cover art, though the original’s aspect ratio was obviously sacrificed.\n\n![Input Mag Sample in Tootsuite’s Audio Player](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/47gjGha3.png)\n\nIf you’re super interested in the truly unmolested output of the attempt, view\/download it [here](https:\/\/davidblue.wtf\/audio\/onlyfansbansample.m4a).\n\n### HMU\n\nBefore I depart actual tutorializing and return to opining, I want to express *even more aggressively than usual* how much I want *anyone* who see’s any potential benefit the ability to generate audio of my darling Siri Voice 2 reading text, but has further questions\/doesn’t have time to fiddle\/struggles with my haphazardly-written attempts at guides like this, or who simply wants to talk about any satellite subjects, **[please reach out to me](https:\/\/bit.ly\/whoisdavidblue)**. **You have no idea how much I’d love to help you configure a personal automation that genuinely, reliably, and durably improves your quality of life.**\n\nIf you follow this shortlink from within a browser on any iOS device, my full contact card will appear: `bit.ly\/whoisdavidblue`.\n\nSuggestions\/requests regarding considerations I’ve obviously missed in this guide are not just *welcome* in this case, but actually *necessary*.

It was just me... Alone, in my mother’s basement, on a Monday morning, contorted at stupid angles, typing to my phone with a physical keyboard and unapologetically scarfing as much as I possibly could of the Apple community’s unbelievably unreserved, almost *spiritual* volume of **pure hype** from as many simultaneous sources as I could manage. (Hilariously, *all* of said sources are\/were Discord servers, now, as in that “gamer” communications service I launched my little indie mag on in 2015 and [kept comparing to Slack](https:\/\/bilge.world\/discord-slack-comparison), but like an actual madman.)\n\nAnyway, said Senior Vice President of Software Engineering (who we are encouraged to hold accountable for basically all technical changes to iOS) is named Craig, and these are his first few sentences:\n\n> `For many of us, our iPhone has become indispensable. And at the heart of iPhone is iOS. iOS powers the experiences we've come to rely on. This year, we were inspired to create even more meaningful ways iPhone could help you. Our new release is iOS 15. It's packed with features that make the iOS experience adapt to and complement the way you use iPhone...`\n\nI’m dwelling on them because they are **patently meaningless**. Very little to nothing coming in iOS 15 is what I would call *ease-of-use-centric*. Some of it - namely controversial (and now backpedaled) changes to the user interface of Safari - feels almost maliciously quartered in the opposite direction. Most of the changes in the subheadings of **[the full feature list](https:\/\/www.apple.com\/ios\/ios-15-preview\/features\/)** are simply irrelevant in the use for all but the dorkiest iOS users, like myself, and I find the fact unacceptable, at the very least.\n\n![The Foundation Image](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/t2IieKLq.png)\n\nThis is why I would like to try something different, this year, and focus on an entirely different audience: my family, as representatives of the vast majority of the iPhone’s billion-something demographic (read: customers.) That is to say, who Craig *should* be referring to with the phrase “most of us.” Not because I believe them to be “dumb” or “end users” (in the tech bro derogatory sense,) but because they are busy, working people who depend on their iPhone as a *utilitarian* device, above all else. They don’t have the time to dive deep into Apple documentation or watch the whole WWDC presentation to gain an understanding of where to look for new features or (unfortunately) how to turn them off. Realistically, they don’t even have time to read this whole Post, though I hope they will (sorry fam.)\n\n<!--more-->\n\nRegardless of how we feel about it, Apple has made it clear that our phones are going to be further and further inundated with automated processes in the background. Whether you like it or not, your phone is going to be used to help find other users’ devices over the Find My network, your travel information is going to be used to inform Apple Maps’ live traffic statistics, and so on. For the more conservative members of my family, related truths about their phones are going to continue to feel like we are continuing to give up “ownership” of our devices. There are definitive alternatives, but they involve giving up a whole lot of conveniences. I will do my best to address this a bit later on, drawing from much more articulate critics than I.\n\n![Testing Home Screens for iOS 15](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/eBBnwCIn.png)\n\nWhat I *will* dwell on, myself, are the more menial, tactile implications of these abstract changes in design philosophy. A general theme of my own use\/writing about iOS has been re-finding or jury-rigging the “buttons” which are gradually being obscured or eliminated entirely in the assumption that Apple’s automation knows better than us users when something should happen or change. A great example: using [a simple Siri Shortcut](https:\/\/www.icloud.com\/shortcuts\/ac6a4587d5b54abc934631c214d81c0c) to completely disable Wi-Fi and Bluetooth instead of trusting the [unnecessarily complex conditions](https:\/\/support.apple.com\/en-us\/HT208086) of doing so with the buttons in Control Center. I have sought out these “hacks” (as other iOS powerusers have rather absurdly called them) for very selfish reasons.\n\n<!--more-->\n\n![Safari Settings in iOS 15](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/oHqejXq1.png)\n\n## The Gist\n\nRounder, still! From the first time you enter your passcode immediately after installing iOS 15, you’ll notice that Notifications and other elements have had their rounded corners *further* rounded, for some reason. Assuming Safari ships with its new look turned on by default, the screenshots embedded above show two locations (subject to change) where one can switch it off. (Your best bet is to visit **[its menu in Settings](prefs:root=SAFARI)** as displayed on the right in `Settings ⇨ Safari`.) As of this writing, at least two of iOS 15’s “headlining” features have been pushed to further iterative updates: [SharePlay](https:\/\/www.independent.co.uk\/life-style\/gadgets-and-tech\/ios-15-apple-shareplay-tv-delay-b1904548.html) and [iCloud Private Relay](https:\/\/www.macrumors.com\/2021\/08\/25\/icloud-private-relay-ios-15-public-beta\/). I suspect you will be prompted to explore Focus Modes upon initial installation, which I will eventually analyze in relative detail. Ideally, you’ll also be prompted to explore “Shared With You,” which I personally believe to be the release’s most significant addition for most people, by far.\n\nAs far as \"meaningful ways iPhone could help you,\" I see little more than glimmers. Focus Modes would be promising were they not so complex to set up, and Notification Summaries are (as of this moment) a pretty hopeless implementation of a theoretically useful concept. Some additional filters in Apple Maps search will prove useful so long as the associated metadata has been updated for locations *other* than San Francisco (say, mid-Missouri.) Optical Character (text) Recognition has been implemented “system wide” under the feature Apple terms “Live Text,” and translation has finally been extended to the places where it’s most useful (think: Safari.)\n\nIn general, though, most of what’s coming with iOS 15 has little real value in the day-to-day experience for most iPhone users. A complete inversion of Craig’s phrase feels significantly more accurate: *This year, we were inspired to create even more superficial ways iPhone could temporarily dazzle tech media*.\n\nAnd now, I’d like to take you through what I feel are the considerations I’d like my family to know - namely my 70-year-old mother, who depends 100% on her iPhone and MacBook Pro every day to run her private practice - but also my \\~8 nieces and nephews spanning 6th grade-graduate school, who all - if I’m not mistaken - have iPhones.\n\n```markdown\nWorthy of note: this “review” is very heavily focused on *iOS* - which is to say *iPhone* - to the point where any overlap with iPadOS\/MacOS\/WatchOS\/HomeOS\/any other goddamned operating system are purely coincidental. For coverage of those changes, please seek your regular sources.\n```\n\n![Shared With You - Photos App in iOS 15](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/5otqrdNU.png)\n\n## Photos\n\n### Shared With You\n\nThe single most important\/welcome feature addition to iOS 15 for most people, I believe, is found in Apple’s native Photos app and entitled **Shared With You**. This view - found in the second tab in the bottom navigation row (“For You”) - is a reverse-chronological timeline of every bit of media (photos & videos) you’ve ever been sent over iMessage. For those with a lot of iOS-using friends (unlike myself,) I would imagine the list will take quite a while to populate.\n\n### Memories\n\nI find Alex Guyot’s bit on changes to Memories (from [his iOS 15 overview for ](https:\/\/www.macstories.net\/stories\/ios-and-ipados-15-the-macstories-overview\/)*[MacStories](https:\/\/www.macstories.net\/stories\/ios-and-ipados-15-the-macstories-overview\/)*) much more concise than what I’d written, so here it is almost in full:\n\n> Memories can now be set to your favorite songs from Apple Music, and can be customized with color filters. Setting different filters will result in different song choices and transition effects to nail a wider variety of vibes on Memories videos.\n\n> While watching a video generated by Memories, you can tap and hold at any time to freeze a photo so that it doesn’t transition away. The song playing over the video will not pause when you do this, but when you let go the remaining video transitions and timings will be automatically altered to match back up with the song’s beat.\n\n> If you don’t want to go with the song that was chosen automatically, you can tap the new Music button to get a pop-up interface into Apple Music, allowing you to choose a song manually. This interface will include smart suggestions for other songs that Apple thinksd you’ll like which would also fit the vibe of your video.\n\nhttps:\/\/youtube.com\/watch?v=7uFR_bSxhTg\n\nYeah. I hope you’re at least half as amused as I have continued to be by algorithmic video generation. [The above result](https:\/\/youtu.be\/7uFR_bSxhTg) was created with absolutely zero modification from an album of images and videos which Photos automatically created via face recognition. The only other coherent option from my own limited set of photos is really the only one that matters, I think you'll agree. \"Pet Friends\" yielded [inevitably uplifting results](https:\/\/youtu.be\/-1bA7-oslkc) in all three of my test renders, but - given a crop of cute dog photos - little intelligence is necessary to produce.\n\nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=-1bA7-oslkc\n\nIf you're experiencing any sort of Déjà vu from the idea of auto-generated slideshows with rights-free soundtracks in the Photos app, it's because Apple has made several distinct attempts to implement very similar iterations of the feature throughout iPhone's history, which has involved iMovie on iOS and MacOS once or twice. I have fiddled with every one - including iOS 15's - and my (truly sound and original) advice is to **avoid spending time trying to customize auto-generated videos** in general. If you explore one of the suggested Memories and find the software's default result satisfactory, of course you should save it, but be wary of any attempts to take editorial control yourself.\n\n![Visual Lookup Indicator in iOS 15](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/74HOlnLP.png)\n\n### Visual Lookup\n\nPerhaps the most unjustifiable background use of your phone’s resources introduced in iOS 15, “Visual Lookup,” seeks to identify “popular art and landmarks around the world, plants and flowers out in nature, books, and breeds of pets” present in your photos so that you might… identify them more swiftly(?) The only means of distinguishing photos on which Visual Lookup has been applied is to look for the modified ⓘ symbol at the very bottom of your screen in the photo browsing view (see the screenshot embedded above.) As you might notice in the screenshots *below*, not one of its analyses on my own images was usably accurate.\n\nThe decision to target the feature on identifying domesticated pets, specifically, is more universalizing than historic landmarks, for sure, but it also immediately sets up the technology (at least this preview of it) for failure.\n\n![Visual Lookup in iOS 15](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/AtxzN45h.png)\n\n### Metadata\n\nHooray! You can now view an image's basic details in the \"Info pane,\" by swiping up on an image or using the ⓘ button. This includes the extension (type) and size of the image file, camera identification and configuration details, and -  as part of Shared With You - from whom\/where you got the image. Bizarrely, the \"Adjust\" tool also lets you alter a given image's timestamp and location information. While I can imagine infinitely many reasons why you'd want to *omit* or *delete* such information, I cannot conceive of a single wholesome reason why one would chose to *change* it, instead.\n\n![Photo Stacks in iOS 15](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/93BGmX4I.png)\n\n### Messages\n\nJust a few weeks shy of [iMessage's tenth birthday](https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20120308031950\/https:\/\/www.apple.com\/ios\/features.html), Apple has finally added a button to save incoming photos directly in Messages conversations. It's about as blatant as Apple interface design gets - you'll spot it opposite others' images. Tapping it saves the appropriate photo(s) directly to the Recents folder before a silly animation vanishes the button itself.\n\nOnce again, from Mr. Guyot:\n\n> Groups of photos that you send will now be shown as stacks instead of in a long list, allowing you to more easily swipe through the images without losing track of the conversation around them. Tap on a stack to open a grid view where you can see and select multiple photos at once.\n\nI took the screenshot embedded above in iOS 15 Developer Beta 5, and… Do “stacks” not look hilariously janky as fuck?\n\n![Live Text in iOS 15](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/DNJOKq85.png)\n\n### Live Text\n\nFor someone like myself, iOS 15’s system-wide integration of Optical Character Recognition is undoubtedly its most useful addition by far. Throughout the Developer Beta, it’s moved up this list gradually as I’ve come to see how it could be useful for *you*, as well.\n\nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=y3kj0-q4k9k\n\nThe [video embedded above](https:\/\/youtu.be\/y3kj0-q4k9k) is a very rough demo, but I suspect it’s more “authentic” than most you’d see elsewhere. The ability to *accurately* capture text right from the camera is invaluable, but for most folks, *line breaks* are going to be a real problem. I’m working on a way to address this with a Siri Shortcut, which I’ll obviously share here when\/if I succeed.\n\n## Audio\n\nhttps:\/\/youtube.com\/watch?v=KhxtfW0taIY\n\n### Background Sounds\n\nMy eldest sister has used a sound\/noise machine to sleep for as long as I can remember, so I was especially excited to show her iOS 15’s native “Background Sounds” feature, but she was distinctly unimpressed, noting that her iPhone-based sound generation needs were well met by third-party apps she’d already discovered.\\[^1\\] I didn’t have time to try out her recommendations, but I’m going to assume they aren’t able to operate “behind” *additional* audio playback like the “new” native feature is.\n\n![Background Sounds Interrupt Remedy](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/SGQt93K4.png)\n\nMy personal (hopefully insightful) anecdote: Background Sounds appear to be impervious from the audio interruption issues iOS has struggled with since its origin, which makes them a partial remedy to the discomfort of sudden, unexpected silence when using headphones with active noise cancellation. As configured in the screenshot embedded above (the menu found in `Settings ⇨ Accessibility ⇨ Audio\/Visual ⇨ Background Sounds`) - with “Use When Media Is Playing” toggled `OFF`- your selected Background Sound *should* fade in when normal playback from another app is interrupted.\\[^2\\]\n\n### “Spatial Audio”\n\nJust to be clear, I strongly believe that normal users should basically ignore all mention of Apple’s “Spatial Audio” (read: don’t worry about it) for a few reasons, most of which aren’t all that interesting. Since [one of my very first written works on tech](https:\/\/bilge.world\/mono-audio-playback) was\/is directly related to the subject, though, indulge me for just a moment for an attempted explanation. Firstly, I must note that only two audio channels (the stereo experiences in various forms you’ve certainly had in your life, regardless of who you are) are necessary for audio to become “spatial.” If you’re curious about this, [my favorite all-time web experience from ](https:\/\/pudding.cool\/2018\/02\/waveforms\/)*[The Pudding](https:\/\/pudding.cool\/2018\/02\/waveforms\/)* is an absolutely impeccable next destination. Secondly, the actual technology behind Apple’s title was not developed by Apple, but by Dolby. It’s not that Apple doesn’t acknowledge this thoroughly in [their explainer docs](https:\/\/support.apple.com\/en-us\/HT212182), nor is Dolby by any means a wee organization in need of my amplification, but this is one of those Apple habits that’s become a particular peev. If you’re interested, [here is the actual spec sheet for Dolby Atmos in PDF](https:\/\/professional.dolby.com\/siteassets\/cinema-products---documents\/dolby-atmos-specifications.pdf).\n\n![Control Center Decibel Meter](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/1vGTW0Iz.png)\n\nIf you happen to have either AirPods Pro or AirPods Max devices, an iPhone 7 or later, *and* an Apple Music subscription, you might want to disregard my cynicism at least long enough to try \"[dynamic head tracking](https:\/\/support.apple.com\/en-us\/HT212182).\"\n\n### SharePlay\n\n*The Verge*’s Chaim Gartenburg did [an excellent - if a bit precocious - job of explaining](https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/22577178\/shareplay-how-to-apple-facetime-ios-15-ipados-macos-monterey-apple-tv-video-music) what he describes as iOS 15’s “headline feature,” called SharePlay:\n\n> It’s a new software feature on top of FaceTime that allows you to watch and listen to movies, TV shows, music, podcasts, and more with friends and family while video chatting.\n\nIn my opinion, SharePlay represents one of those great, well-thought solutions to some notably youth-specific challenges which nobody (even the youth) will see as more worthwhile than their own. By that I mean, one ear bud per person… now, an ancient tradition. I’ve deprioritized it, in contrast to Chaim, because I’d bet it’s also one of those things one can only learn themselves.\n\n![Notifications in iOS 15](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/TFWvW1b6.png)\n\n## Notifications, Focus, and Attention\n\nYes, notifications have gotten *even rounder still* for some reason in iOS 15. Contact photos and “larger app icons” also “make them easier to identify,” according to Apple. (This is the one point in my whole writing life where the phrase *well I’ll be the judge of that!* is 100% valid and applicable.) There’s also a new feature called **Notification Summary** which is an absolutely useless and unnecessary complication, at least at the moment. Honestly, the one bit of solid advice from *[The Social Dilemma](https:\/\/bilge.world\/the-social-dilemma)* was… Just turn all Notifications off, or at least as many as possible. Notifications Summary feels like a near direct response to that one goddamned film, and its new Focus Modes do even more so.\n\nhttps:\/\/youtube.com\/watch?v=YZCx-9wF3ow\n\n### Focus(es)\n\nThe most glaringly standout parallel between Microsoft’s Windows 11 release (which I have also been beta testing much less dutifully for most of this year) and Apple’s stated goals in iOS 15’s design centers around the design supposition that maximum malleability of the “spaces” in which one dwells on their operating system - namely, the “desktop(s)” and\/or “home screen(s)” - lends toward a more healthy digital occupancy of them, especially in terms of attention. Unfortunately, both of them chose respective solutions which - from my view, anyway - **add complexity** more than anything.\n\n*[The Verge](https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/22665196\/ios-15-focus-modes-custom-icons-widgets-how-to)*[’s guide](https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/22665196\/ios-15-focus-modes-custom-icons-widgets-how-to) frames Focus as a customization feature to be used in tandem with [custom app icons](https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/22529978\/apple-iphone-ios-apps-icon-change) to fiddle your way into your own *bespoke iPhone experience*. I could be wrong, but I suspect very few among my family will find the time investment required worth the end result, but we’ll see.\n\n![Focus in iOS 15](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/mxwVtN7p.png)\n\nI chose to embed [Matt Birchler’s guide to Focus](https:\/\/youtu.be\/YZCx-9wF3ow) above because it’s by far the most succinct and helpful video I’ve yet seen on iOS 15, generally, and demonstrates how a working person might actually use Focus. My one addendum to this (and any other Focus) guide: **proceed *without* the automated bits** by avoiding anything under the `TURN ON AUTOMATICALLY` subsection of the menu. For whatever reason, location-based automation triggers on iPhone, especially, have literally **never** functioned usefully (or *reliably*) in my experience.\n\nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=40y7iLdfOnM\n\n## Maps & CarPlay\n\n(I *am* going to do a bit of editorializing on this subject, specifically.) If the video embedded above is confusing, know that it's a very insular joke - over six years ago, in [my video review of the Nissan Juke NISMO](https:\/\/bit.ly\/JukeHonk), I praised its integrated navigation screen specifically for its frugality.\n\n> I'm not old. I don't need a gigantic nav screen. I don't need to see a 3D rendition of the whole Earth and my position relative to it.\n\n...and yet, a playful, exploratory experience is what Apple has in mind for Maps, apparently. Here's their description of the new \"Interactive globe\" feature:\n\n> Discover the natural beauty of Earth with a rich and interactive 3D globe, including significantly enhanced details for mountain ranges, deserts, forests, oceans, and more.\n\nIn the footnotes, it’s explained that the feature will only be available on \"iPhone with A12 Bionic or later,\" meaning the iPhone X range, basically, which makes sense considering the extent of animation and touch manipulation technology present in this view. It’s an entertaining plaything, but not much more, which is strange and frustrating. If I could gather the usage statistics across all my family’s iPhones, how much time would you suppose they’ve spent in Apple Maps to date *screwing around* as opposed to *searching and navigating*?\n\nhttps:\/\/twitter.com\/NeoYokel\/status\/1437519482428272641\n\nPut another way - Apple’s developmental direction for Apple Maps as a service seems distinctly toward a travel\/entertainment application (notably, like [Google Earth](https:\/\/apps.apple.com\/us\/app\/google-earth\/id293622097),) instead of a utilitarian navigation app (like [Google Maps](https:\/\/apps.apple.com\/us\/app\/google-maps\/id585027354), [Waze](https:\/\/apps.apple.com\/us\/app\/waze-navigation-live-traffic\/id323229106), or [MapQuest](https:\/\/apps.apple.com\/us\/app\/mapquest-gps-navigation-maps\/id316126557).) It’s not just the Interactive globe. One of the most exciting features in last year’s release (iOS 14) was the ability for Maps users to create custom Guides. I created [my own](https:\/\/bit.ly\/columbiaguide) containing a few local spots I believe to be especially relevant for first-time travelers\/new residents of *my* area. Clearly, I misinterpreted the intended function of Guides entirely - continuing without a means of discovering *user-generated* guides, whatsoever, iOS 15 cements (in my view) that they’ll instead continue to be left to travel magazines, none of which I recognize save for *Atlas Obscura*, who’s “[Hidden Wonders of Chicago](https:\/\/guides.apple.com\/?lsp=9902&pg=15126682529740253227)” guide appears to be the single worthwhile representation of the Midwest on the service.\n\n![Apple Maps User Account in iOS 15](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/TxDuz5nb.png)\n\nOne welcome exception to this absence of investment in user-generated content is the new, unified “user account” view, which aggregates one’s curation (both private and public) along with travel preferences and a list of one’s **contributions** to Apple Maps - another new feature for the app.\n\n![Place Cards - Apple Maps in iOS 15](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/LX5HW4T3.png)\n\nAbove is a screenshot of my first test contribution to Apple Maps (my [mom’s private practice](http:\/\/bit.ly\/elonglcswam),) which also serves as an example of Maps’ new “place cards.” As of this writing, all of my test contributions are still held \"Pending Review,\" yet navigating to [the share link](https:\/\/maps.apple.com\/place?address=1714%20Oak%20Cliff%20Pl,%20Columbia,%20MO%20%2065203,%20United%20States&auid=6487223830929868055&ll=38.933965,-92.387854&lsp=9902&q=Eileen%20Long,%20MSW%20LCSW&_ext=CjIKBQgEEOIBCgQIBRADCgQIBhByCgQIChAACgQIUhAECgQIVRAACgQIWRAGCgUIpAEQARImKZSjW\/v4dkNAMW0PujQxGVfAORJ5gVcfeENAQd9\/R\/9zGFfAUAM%3D&t=m) with a desktop browser indicates they've already been made public.\n\n![3D Hy-Vee](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/SILn5LmG.png)\n\n### CarPlay\n\nAs of this writing, it’s unclear how much of the Maps features I’ve used will be carried over to CarPlay upon iOS 15.0.0’s official release, but I know for *certain* that CarPlay is a weekly (if not daily) used feature by virtually all of my family members. With the additional variable of [differences in support between given automobile marques\/models](https:\/\/www.apple.com\/ios\/carplay\/available-models\/) - including which support [Car Key](https:\/\/support.apple.com\/en-us\/HT211234) - it’s difficult to say definitively what will have changed about your personal CarPlay use. What experience I do have using CarPlay has been exclusively with my mom’s [2019 Volkswagen Jetta](https:\/\/youtu.be\/hqQqfdHsGx0,) and documented visually in [this photo gallery](https:\/\/snap.as\/extratone\/ios15) as well as [on my alt Instagram](https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/dieselgoth\/channel)’s “iOS & iPhone” IGTV Series.\n\n![Apple Maps Night Navigation](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/iQD53oId.png)\n\nTo once again cite from [the official full features list](https:\/\/hyp.is\/Cbc_LBUmEey4S4Mcwd1lKA\/www.apple.com\/ios\/ios-15-preview\/features\/):\n\n> An all-new driving map helps you see traffic, incidents, and other details that affect your drive at a glance. See incredible road details like turn lanes, bike, bus, and taxi lanes, medians, crosswalks, and much more. When approaching a complex interchange, Maps switches to a 3D road-level perspective to help you find your way.\"\n\n\"It's faster and easier to report an issue in Maps\" is a standout, literal statement. Once you've navigated to the menu in the screenshot below (via the chatbox with exclamation point icon,) touching any of the three options will *immediately* report its respective information without confirmation.\n\n![Report an Incident - CarPlay in iOS 15](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/VKfuhJvH.png)\n\nThe default **Driving Focus** can be configured to activate automatically as soon as CarPlay connects which *would* be the single exception from my earlier advice against automating Focus modes at all were it not for the mode's lockout from the Lock Screen (as shown in the first of the three screenshots embedded below.)\n\n![Driving Focus in iOS 15](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/m5974FcB.png)\n\nOnce you've locked your device with the Driving Focus on, you must clear an extra step to unlock it by selecting \"I'm Not Driving,\" which then turns the Focus off. In my (unsolicited) opinion, this renders the Focus unusable at best and arguably downright dangerous. \"Hey Siri!\" is an option most folks I know leave off and I can't imagine a single reason to add such an obstruction.\n\n![Custom Car Focus - iOS 15](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/xcNfKv6g.png)\n\nI *can* offer a solution, however, in the form of my custom Car Focus, which only allows calls and texts from my mom, open a single, otherwise-hidden custom (work-in-progress) Home Screen with exclusively driving\/nav\/travel-relevant apps, and even activates automatically via a very simple automation in [the Shortcuts app](https:\/\/apps.apple.com\/us\/app\/shortcuts\/id1462947752). Technically, the only feature it's missing from the default Driving Focus are automatic text replies, which (as of beta) weren't working anyway.\n\nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=-hNCsS4I0uk\n\nFor those new to Siri Shortcuts completely, I recorded a [rough video guide](https:\/\/youtu.be\/-hNCsS4I0uk) on how to set up both the Focus and its automation.\n\n![Reminders in iOS 15](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/0tsmBGe3.png)\n\n### Reminders\n\n“A to-do list is, ultimately, nothing more or less than an attempt to persuade yourself” concludes [a feature by Clive Thompson](https:\/\/www.wired.com\/story\/to-do-apps-failed-productivity-tools) in the most recent issue of *WIRED*. In the face of a literally indigestible volume of available (and *award-winning*!) Task Management applications found on iOS - [Microsoft To Do](https:\/\/apps.apple.com\/us\/app\/microsoft-to-do\/id1212616790), [Microsoft Lists](https:\/\/apps.apple.com\/us\/app\/microsoft-lists\/id1530637363), [Todoist](https:\/\/apps.apple.com\/us\/app\/todoist-to-do-list-tasks\/id572688855), [Things 3](https:\/\/apps.apple.com\/us\/app\/things-3\/id904237743), [Fantastical](https:\/\/apps.apple.com\/us\/app\/fantastical-calendar-tasks\/id718043190), [GoodTask](https:\/\/apps.apple.com\/us\/app\/goodtask-to-do-list-tasks\/id1068039220), [OmniFocus 3](https:\/\/apps.apple.com\/us\/app\/omnifocus-3\/id1346190318), and on… - Apple’s Reminders app has always had perhaps the most insurmountable task of all its native applications in remaining competitive. Up until I wrote this review, my personal list in the app was nothing but a wasteland of forgotten, out-of-context items from up to 7 years ago (!) which I’d obviously set with Siri without bothering to correct its voice recognition.\n\nBefore you proceed to experiment with Reminders, I’d recommend using my [Reminders Backup Siri Shortcut](https:\/\/routinehub.co\/shortcut\/10118) to create a .zip file of *all* existing items in your Reminders app, even if there are just a few. I insist upon this largely because it’s so fast and so frugal. (Here’s [how to allow the addition of Siri Shortcuts from third-party sources](https:\/\/support.apple.com\/guide\/shortcuts\/enable-shared-shortcuts-apdfeb05586f\/ios).)\n\nFor a particularly positive - but very trustworthy - perspective on the additions to Reminders coming in iOS 15, [John Voorhees’ overview for ](https:\/\/www.macstories.net\/stories\/reminders-smart-lists-put-unprecedented-control-in-the-hands-of-users\/)*[MacStories](https:\/\/www.macstories.net\/stories\/reminders-smart-lists-put-unprecedented-control-in-the-hands-of-users\/)* is succinct and informative.\n\nhttps:\/\/imgur.com\/gallery\/u8HxROl\n\nAn opportunity for an anecdotal, but genuinely exciting! demonstration is allowed us in Reminders: **Drag & Drop** is, indeed, *[finally here](https:\/\/imgur.com\/gallery\/u8HxROl)*.\n\n![Safari in iOS 15](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/14Xf21CA.png)\n\n## Safari\n\n```markdown\nBefore you read on… If you’re just wondering how to make Safari go back to the way it was before, refer back to the first subhead on this page (“The Gist.”)\n```\n\nThe one commonality in the experience of every single person finishing up their iOS 15 review\/overview\/guide: we’ve all saved Safari for the very last minute. I am 99% certain the saga surrounding changes to Apple’s native web browser - along with my personal, reactionary gripes spewed along the past two months of iOS 15’s Developer Beta cycle - were the overwhelmingly affirming factors that led to me pursuing this very review. I have rewritten this portion over and over again, but now that you know how to disable the new look, I’m going to as briefly as possible summarize the changes that are actually relevant to you.\n\n![Overamped Browser Extension](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/U6SKFiXN.png)\n\n* You can now **pull down to refresh**, which apparently the youths *actually* refer to with the acronym “PTR,” these days.\n* **Safari Extensions** might be worthwhile. I **absolutely insist** that everyone reading this install one called **[Overamped](https:\/\/apps.apple.com\/us\/app\/overamped\/id1573901090)** which I have been testing. Basically, you’ll never need to think about Google AMP again, which is an absolute gift, I promise.\n* **Tab Groups** will almost certainly be nothing but a nuisance for all but the most ridiculous iPhone poweruses like myself.\\[^3\\]\n\nhttps:\/\/twitter.com\/NeoYokel\/status\/1438980179712479241\n\nIf, like me, you’ve always found Bookmark\/Favorites management in Safari utterly impossible, you’ll rejoice at the implications of Drag & Drop as demonstrated in the [Twitter video](https:\/\/twitter.com\/NeoYokel\/status\/1438980179712479241) embedded above.\n\n## Baubles\n\n![OMNIMEMOJI](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/p8U6kW1g.png)\n\n### Memoji\n\nFinally, the great, terrible Apple God has granted its bizarre animated minimes a torso! I have always found memoji [alarming](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/iphone\/comments\/he03xb), mostly, but now that I’ve paid them mind, I would like to express my sympathy for those of you who enjoy using them. I’m sorry to report that you will still need to go to `Messages` and open the compose window in a conversation in order to select the emoji iMessage app. Though iOS 15 adds full bodies to memoji (and clothes to cover them, as required since Adam & Eve,) as well as “accessible accessories,”\\[^4\\] there’s not as yet any way to actually *see* a memoji in full-body view other than the editing interface (as far as I could tell.) You can also choose to separately color your memoji’s eyes.\n\n![Facetime in The Browser Comedy](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/vBw0CNhW.png)\n\n### Facetime in The Browser\n\nYes, you can *technically* Facetime with non-Apple devices thanks to iOS 15's changes. In fact, you'll be able to \"Facetime\" any device with a web browser! *However*, in doing so you will be forgoing every single one of Facetime's advantages: call quality, \"privacy,\" ecosystem integration, etc. Without these, it would be silly to use Facetime over literally *any* other video calling service. What an immense waste of time, eh?\n\nhttps:\/\/twitter.com\/NeoYokel\/status\/1430679850399014912\n\nFor the sake of thoroughness, though, I should note that I appear to be alone in this view of the new Facetime changes. *MacStories* founder and Ultimate iPad Sage Federico Viticci’s [report on the subject](https:\/\/www.macstories.net\/stories\/facetimes-audio-and-video-take-a-leap-forward-with-apples-upcoming-iphone-ipad-and-mac-os-updates\/) was one of mostly satisfaction.\n\n<!--more-->\n\nI will note, too, that [my test](https:\/\/whyp.it\/t\/testing-the-mic-modes-coming-in-facetime-with-ios-15-54749) of the new “Mic Modes” function yielded impressive results (along with a few other experiences I’ve had so far,) especially in the “Voice Isolation” mode’s performance, but - [as I lamented on Twitter](https:\/\/twitter.com\/NeoYokel\/status\/1430680198442332160) - its association with FaceTime makes it unavailable where one actually could make use of it on iOS.\n\n## Omissions\n\nI know it probably doesn’t mean much to you, but in my lifetime of beta testing iPhone updates, I have never experienced such a disastrous cycle as 15’s. *[MacWorld](https:\/\/www.macworld.com\/article\/353957\/ios-15-features-missing-at-launch.html)*[’s outline](https:\/\/www.macworld.com\/article\/353957\/ios-15-features-missing-at-launch.html) of the expected features *not* coming in today’s release from the 7th of this month has no less than *eight* headings: *SharePlay*, *Legacy Contacts*, *App Privacy Report*, *3D CarPlay navigation*, *Universal Control*, *IDs in Wallet*, *Custom iCloud email domains*, and *CSAM scanning features*.\n\nhttps:\/\/twitter.com\/NeoYokel\/status\/1438960700286717955\n\nFor us powerusers, Siri Shortcuts are absolutely fucked and Apple Dork Twitter is livid about it. Personally, I find these to be the least problematic of the unfixed bugs, and I can only hope it means that Apple has prioritized fixes for the features most relevant in *your* life. I will be updating this Post as actively as I can in the coming weeks and always appreciate any questions or thoughts you might have about how I could make it more useful.\n\n\\[1\\] If you’re reading this and happen to be looking for app recommendations, let me know and I’ll ask her.\n\\[2\\] This wasn’t working reliably in the last Developer Beta, but I’ll do my best to check back for the normal release.\n\\[3\\] This is one of those things I can’t say more about until I actually hear from other folks… I’ll check back in a month or so.\n\\[4\\] The full quote: “Three new accessibility options let you represent yourself with cochlear implants, oxygen tubes, or a soft helmet.”\n\n#software","views":1694,"updated":"2021-12-08T16:29:02Z","tags":["software"],"type":null,"title":"iOS 15 Reviewed for My Family","slug":"ios-15-family-review","appearance":"norm","language":"en","rtl":false,"created":"2021-09-19T09:30:00Z","images":["https:\/\/i.snap.as\/iQD53oId.png","https:\/\/i.snap.as\/VKfuhJvH.png","https:\/\/i.snap.as\/m5974FcB.png","https:\/\/i.snap.as\/vBw0CNhW.png","https:\/\/i.snap.as\/X3rV4nPq.png","https:\/\/i.snap.as\/SGQt93K4.png","https:\/\/i.snap.as\/1vGTW0Iz.png","https:\/\/i.snap.as\/mxwVtN7p.png","https:\/\/i.snap.as\/oHqejXq1.png","https:\/\/i.snap.as\/74HOlnLP.png","https:\/\/i.snap.as\/xcNfKv6g.png","https:\/\/i.snap.as\/U6SKFiXN.png","https:\/\/i.snap.as\/DNJOKq85.png","https:\/\/i.snap.as\/TFWvW1b6.png","https:\/\/i.snap.as\/LX5HW4T3.png","https:\/\/i.snap.as\/p8U6kW1g.png","https:\/\/i.snap.as\/t2IieKLq.png","https:\/\/i.snap.as\/5otqrdNU.png","https:\/\/i.snap.as\/AtxzN45h.png","https:\/\/i.snap.as\/93BGmX4I.png","https:\/\/i.snap.as\/14Xf21CA.png","https:\/\/i.snap.as\/eBBnwCIn.png","https:\/\/i.snap.as\/TxDuz5nb.png","https:\/\/i.snap.as\/SILn5LmG.png","https:\/\/i.snap.as\/0tsmBGe3.png"],"collection":{"public":false,"alias":"bilge","total_posts":0,"title":"The Psalms","verification_link":"","description":"A <a href=\"https:\/\/davidblue.wtf\/db.vcf\">narcoleptic yokel<\/a> on software and culture.","style_sheet":"","views":177027,"monetization_pointer":""},"paid":false},{"id":"d3seph7tqkbr5n2v","body":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=bTWO6bG1fI0\n\n## Join us to celebrate our server's sixth birthday...

For three U.S. Dollars a month, “[Twitter Blue](https:\/\/blog.twitter.com\/en_us\/topics\/company\/2021\/introducing-twitter-blue)” is [now available](https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2021\/11\/9\/22766286\/twitter-blue-subscription-service-scroll-nuzzel-undo-tweets-ad-free-articles-us) for all United States users. Aside from [a relentless, rude, two and a half hour-long rant](https:\/\/apple.co\/3wVZs3v) at two new friends on *End User*, I should confess that I haven’t spoken adequately to peers at length about their Twitter use - understandably, busy independent artists don’t seem to find themsevles with the spare time to hypothesize methodically about what they might want from the service, going forward. From the mass of commentary on Twitter Blue I *was* able to gather, a resounding sentiment refrains: *these features should be available to everyone*.\n\nhttps:\/\/open.spotify.com\/episode\/3VSCTrzf9QN2MjyFMQ930d\n\nFrankly, after all these years, there’s not all that much to actually say about the product, itself. Thanks to Spaces, I happened to catch a chance to ask my favorite sage of late - Jason Scott, original creator of textfiles.com - for his thoughts. \n\n“Well, I bought it.”\n“Yeah, same.”\n\n![Twitter in Jorts Dock, 2021](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/zp5uCNwa.png)\n\nThen, we talked for 45 minutes about self-actualization. As I’ve recently honed my understanding of the significance behind my own personal extraordinary dependence\/investment in this one service, I have also - in parallel, ya might say - refined wholly a set of expectations which I do not ever again expect to be usurped in any way by Twitter, Incorporated’s decisions. Believe it not, these thoughts of mine really *do* have real potential to add value to your life, especially if you’re still reading. The next time you find yourself wondering what Twitter might do next, try to internalize the utter inanity of that whole pursuit. Not one second can be concretely spent in that endeavor because the organization is defined singularly by its outrageous negligence. They are not villains or demons like [Big Blue](https:\/\/github.com\/extratone\/bigblue) - they are through and through a village of idiots, and no manner of user action can possibly budge them.\n\n<video controls>\n  <source src=\"https:\/\/github.com\/extratone\/bilge\/raw\/main\/video\/TwitterBlue.MP4\">\n<\/video>\n\nOf course, this new development of mine hasn’t actually managed to delivery any peace upon my person. In fact, because it is impossible to be *constructively* critical in such a situation, I am one of few I know who must continue to be critical, anyway, because my livelihood does not depend on the newsworthiness of my subject matter. I guess I should just be thankful my “must” represents so little time-sensitive consequence, if any, given how long it takes me to finish anything, these days.

This company’s software is bad and its continued prioritization of the two native mobile applications (neither of which it actually built) over any other clients for *all* user considerations is a spectacular tedium to follow. Its world record breaking inability to understand anything about how its *whole shit* fits into the lives of *any* of its users continues to astound. My peak irritation about the whole situation, lately, is that *you fuckers* continue to discuss alterations to social software, generally, as if they are *inevitable* with a sense of complicity I will *not* allow. I’m not going to argue that you’re *obligated* to speak up and out in a labor sense, but beseeching that you **expect more** from these organizations as a customer, a citizen, and a human being.\n\nFor your sake, I've spent the time to break Twitter Blue's offering down specifically, feature by feature, only because I have yet to see it done methodically in detail from the tech media sources you'd normally depend on.\n\n![Thread Reader - Twitter Blue for iOS](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/SAYPlThr.png)\n\n## Thread Reader\n\nIf I’m honest, the majority of the discourse I’ve picked up surrounding Twitter threads in the past few years has been negative. Vaguely, “getting lost” is something I recall being expressed. Twitter Blue’s Thread Reader offers a “reader view”-like experience in three different font sizes - none of which looked particularly optimal, to my eye. If there’s anything to say about it, really, it’s suggest this adjustment be made more variable, natively, though further adjustment is allowed at the moment by using `⌘ + =, -, and 0` for those iPhone keyboarders among you.\n\n![Voice Tweets in Thread Reader - Twitter for iOS](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/1ia6xNyv.png)\n\nAlso, the appearance of non text-only posts (especially Voice Tweets, which I, alone, continue to use) in this view feels like a bit of an afterthought. \n\n![Custom Navigation - Twitter Blue on iOS](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/hu2p7mN2.png)\n\n## Custom Navigation\n\nIntentionally or not, the configuration of Twitter for iOS’ navigation tabs enabled by Twitter Blue membership is a revelation - or it would be, were it the only viable Twitter client on the platform. It’s perhaps the most celebratable feature included in Twitter Blue, if only because it suggests the Twitter team is finally paying attention to Tweetbot. (In case you weren’t aware, I spent a significant amount of time and words writing about just how valuable Tweetbot is, [earlier this year](https:\/\/bilge.world\/tweetbot-6-ios-review).) Unfortunately for Twitter, [Tweetbot’s had an incredible year](https:\/\/www.macstories.net\/ios\/tweetbot-6-6-gets-support-for-creating-polls-limiting-who-can-reply-to-tweets\/). The biggest possible miss, here, was adamantly missed: one *cannot* customize away the “Home” timeline from the first nav bar position, which brings up another huge issue with expecting a monthly fee for an experience within Twitter’s iOS app: *persistence*. \n\nhttps:\/\/twitter.com\/neoyokel\/status\/1467393675579871234\n\nIn the clip of the Twitter feedback Space embedded above, my second point of note was that the app had not “randomly logged me out” in the seven days I’d then been subscribed to Twitter Blue. To be clear, this was referring to the experience of opening the Twitter for iOS app to the welcome screen instead of where one left off, which has indeed happened in the interim. The worst bit: after logging back in again, all one’s app preferences are reset to their respective defaults. Without a means of exporting or “backing up” one’s settings - like say, [Better Tweetdeck](https:\/\/better.tw) has - this means that one has to methodically explore every single Settings menu and re-select core essentials like posting the highest quality possible images, for instance, all with the knowledge that such a reset could happen again at any time. Suffice it to say, this is not the sort of quality one expects from a premium iOS app in 2021. \n\nhttps:\/\/twitter.com\/neoyokel\/status\/1463658007791812608\n\nAs you’ll see in the screenshot embedded above, Custom Navigation offers one a choice of up to 6 tabs from a total of 10, which include [some Bluetooth keyboard shortcut considerations](https:\/\/github.com\/ExtraKeys\/keys\/issues\/31#issuecomment-986184090) I suspect you’ll not find detailed from any other source. \n\n### Bluetooth Keyboard Shortcuts Support\n\nTo start, `⌘ + F` will now reliably open the Explore tab and (most of the time) deliver one’s cursor directly to its search field. However, **this only functions when Explore has been selected as one of the bottom nav tabs**, which really misses out on an opportunity for the shortcut to be uniquely useful, in my view. Otherwise, `⌘ + 1-6` will open the bottom tabs you’ve chosen in order, which means - brace yourselves - that Twitter Blue’s Custom Navigation technically includes *configurable keyboard shortcuts*.\n\nhttps:\/\/twitter.com\/neoyokel\/status\/1467681892468154370\n\nAlso notable: when viewing the obligatory Home tab, one can navigate between their Lists with just the (unmodified) left and right arrow keys!  `⌘ + ,` is now a dependable way of opening the app’s Settings menu, `⌘ + \\` pulls up the account switcher, `⌘ + =,-,0` manipulates text size, app-wide. `⌘ + V` will open Tweets from links in one’s clipboard from anywhere in the app - not a new trick, I don’t think, but a clever one. As of this writing, [the public-facing document of Twitter for iOS’ Bluetooth keyboard shortcuts](https:\/\/help.twitter.com\/en\/using-twitter\/twitter-ios-app) is quite inaccurate. For example, it lists `⌘ + M` as the command to switch between light and dark mode in the app, which is actually accomplished with `⌘ + ⇧ + D`.\n\n![Undo Tweet - Twitter Blue](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/Qfb0rFvf.png)\n\n## Undo Tweet\n\nPerhaps unlike you, *I* have never had a problem understanding why “editable” Tweets will never exist, largely thanks to [my conversation with Eugen Rochko](https:\/\/hyp.is\/znp7tEQJEeySOXvhkqI2DQ\/bilge.world\/eugen-rochko-interview) about implementing editable posts on Mastodon:\n\n> That won't happen. There's actually a good reason why they don't do that. It's simply because you could make a toot about one thing, have people favorite it and share it, link it from other places, and then suddenly, it says 'Heil Hitler,' or something.\n\nThis, actually, is *not* the reason I found it easy to understand, though I hope it makes a bit of a sense. It was when Eugen mentioned (unquoted) Twitter's original design around SMS[^1] that I first vaguely understood the depth of this limitation in the core architecture of the service. As far as I understand it, **the method in which a Tweet’s basic data is stored does not allow for revision**. It can be deleted or obfuscated, but never substituted for or replaced.\n\nAs I noted all those years ago. **Delete & Re-Draft** - the answer Mastodon integrated natively and third-party social clients have featured for years - makes *a lot* more sense than straight up \"editable Tweets\" *or* the chosen answer at the top of Twitter Blue's feature list, \"[Undo Tweet](https:\/\/help.twitter.com\/en\/using-twitter\/twitter-blue-features#undo-tweet).\" \n\nHere's the full text from [**its subpage**](https:\/\/help.twitter.com\/en\/using-twitter\/twitter-blue-features#undo-tweet) in Twitter's documentation:\n\n> **Undo Tweet** gives you the option to retract a Tweet after you send it, but before it’s visible to others on Twitter. It’s not an edit button, but a chance to preview and revise your Tweet before it’s posted for the world to see. Once the Undo period is over, the Tweet is viewable to your followers and you can either leave it or delete it, like you normally would on Twitter. \n>\n> - Tapping Undo sends you back to the Tweet composer where you can make changes before posting the Tweet, or deciding not to post at all. You can also select Send now to skip the Undo Tweet option and post your tweet immediately.\n> - You can turn Undo Tweet settings on for all or some of the [different types of Tweets](https:\/\/help.twitter.com\/en\/using-twitter\/twitter-blue-how-to.html#undodifftweets) including Original Tweets, Quote Tweets, threads, and replies. \n> - When active, Undo Tweet displays a countdown of the time left until your default 30-second Tweet Undo period expires, and your Tweet appears on Twitter. Shorten or lengthen the expiration window to 5, 10, 20 or 60 seconds under the [Twitter Blue feature settings menu](https:\/\/help.twitter.com\/en\/using-twitter\/twitter-blue-how-to.html#undotweetperiod).\n> - If you turn off Undo Tweet, you won’t see the Undo Tweet prompt.\n> - Read more about [how to adjust the settings of your Undo Tweet feature](https:\/\/help.twitter.com\/en\/using-twitter\/twitter-blue-how-to.html#undotweet).\n\nBy default, Undo Tweet is turned on for every single post of any kind at 20 seconds' notice. This was my very first change to the default settings ([other than the highlight color and app icon](https:\/\/twitter.com\/NeoYokel\/status\/1459235983174639626)): I turned it off for Original Tweets, Replies, and Threads. This makes it tolerable, but still useless, and honestly, I can think of only one instance in which I used it for its intended purpose.\n\n![Pinned DMs - Twitter Blue on iOS](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/8aFbZdVQ.png)\n\n## Longer Videos & Pinned Conversations\n\nThe only straight up “we’ll let you take up a bit more bandwidth since you’re paying us” feature addition included with Twitter Blue is its elongation of the time limit for posted videos from two to ten minutes. One of very few observations about Twitter Blue I could find from “regular” Twitter Users comes from [r\/Twitter](https:\/\/reddit.com\/r\/Twitter) (which is uh…. a mess:)\n\n> the only reason i got it is because it allows 10 minutes of videos you can post and since I make content I no longer have to be restrained to the 2:20 video time on the \"regular\" Twitter.\n-[u\/jdb825](https:\/\/reddit.com\/r\/Twitter\/comments\/qxygfb\/_\/hmddlli\/?context=1)\n\nI personally feel this post wholeheartedly - especially since I’ve basically committed to single-take video content, personally, yet have been regularly sharing screencaps on my account. An anecdote I have not seen mentioned: for videos uploaded directly to Twitter’s “Media Studio” (a feature to which I have access because of my peak Periscope fame, years ago,) the two-minute limit still applies. Yet another beautifully absurd product oversight.\n\nFrom the screenshot embedded above, it’s quite obvious that I no longer use Twitter’s Direct Messages, but there was a time,  many years ago, when I would have personally appreciated “**Pinned Conversations**” very much.\n\n![Ad-Free Articles in Safari - Twitter Blue](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/7RBw18tJ.png)\n\n## Ad-Free Articles\n\nAs much as I want to unabashedly celebrate the investment Twitter, Inc. is inexplicably now demonstrating in Lists - a feature I’ve [tirelessly advocated for](https:\/\/bilge.world\/twitter-lists) out of perceived obscurity - with Twitter Blue, there’s at least one example which they’ve managed to fuck up such investment. The official list of publishers participating in Twitter Blue’s “Ad-Free Articles” rehash of Scroll is exclusively documented in the from of [@TwitterBlue’s singular Twitter List](https:\/\/twitter.com\/i\/lists\/1448014243245150209), which makes it conveniently quite difficult to share. Aside from that anecdote, I have another which is both mostly personal and yet inexcludable. \n\nThe day [Twitter acquired Scroll](https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2021\/10\/5\/22711233\/scroll-shutting-down-twitter-blue-standalone-subscription-ad-free-article-service), I had the bizarre, completely unexpected opportunity to ask Tony Haile - Scroll’s founder, who also played a substantial role in creating the Ad-Tech Hell it was founded to counter in creating Chartbeat, some years ago - *a question*. I’d been listening to a Twitter Space hosted by [Chris Messina](https:\/\/twitter.com\/chrismessina) and [Brian McCullough](https:\/\/twitter.com\/brianmcc) for *TechMeme* featuring Haile while I’d been showering. Somehow, the two ran out of questions to ask Tony, so they turned to the audience. I requested to speak and Chris - who’d done so a few times before - let me in almost immediately.\n\nNude and still very wet, standing in my bathroom, I suddenly found myself on a call, essentially, with certainly the most interesting media industry figure of the moment. Chris, who knew me well enough already as a regular in his Spaces to know my speech often includes long pauses, said something like “quickly.” I began by bringing back a topic from an hour before, at least, and noted that Twitter’s “Tips” feature was no more than a list of hyperlinks as it stood (it basically still is,) before (more or less verbatim:)\n\n“I just got out of the shower but uh… I forgot about Tony Haile. (yes, he was listening directly to the Space and I did say that) …but I would ask him to narrate how exactly he got from Chartbeat to Scroll to Twitter.” Yes, I spoke of him in the third person even though I could all but hear him breathing. I then retired from my speaking role, but - from what I could tell, passively listening as I finished getting ready for some time-sensitive engagement - my question basically sustained the rest of the interview. \n\nThis experience, alone, wouldn’t necessarily be worth mentioning, but after discovering *The Kansas City Star* - one of the oldest, most established local mastheads to my home state (Missouri,) to which I maintain a subscription - among the aforelinked List list of participating publishers in Twitter Blue’s Ad-Free Articles program, I reached out to the one *Star* reporter I know, asking simply if she’d heard anything whatsoever about the program from editors or just ambiently in the newsroom. She had not. \n\nFor an explanation, I dug just a bit further and found out the *Stars*’ corporate owner, McClatchy, had in fact [“tested” a “partnership” with Scroll before](https:\/\/www.niemanlab.org\/2020\/12\/scroll-the-ad-free-news-startup-will-experiment-with-bundled-subscriptions-at-eight-mcclatchy-sites\/), and appeared to have opted its whole handful of local American news institutions - including the *Star* - in again, en masse, to its new, Twitter-owned form. \n\nBefore I go on, I should note that one can indeed utilize Ad-Free articles’ benefit within your preferred web browser, but the process is very specific. On iOS, you’ll need to open an Ad-Free Article in the Twitter app first (marked with blue text) and then tap the Safari icon in the bottom right to open your default browser. You’ll know you’ve authenticated correctly when you see one of these two motherfuckers[^3] (depending on your system’s current light\/dark theme setting) in the bottom right of your browser window:\n\n![Twitter Blue Tabs](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/Qs5cIakt.png)\n\nFor thoroughness’ sake, here’s what [the official help document](https:\/\/help.twitter.com\/en\/using-twitter\/twitter-blue-ad-free-articles) has to say:\n\n> As long as you stay logged in to Twitter, and use the same browser each time, you should get ad-free reading when you subsequently visit that same Twitter Blue site.\n\nHave a peak at [*The Kansas City Star*’s Wikipedia page](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/The_Kansas_City_Star) and you’ll note that it’s over 150 years old, once claimed Ernest Hemingway on its masthead, has been awarded eight Pulitzer Prizes, and that it depends on a combination of advertising dollars and [possibly in duress](https:\/\/jimmycsays.com\/2018\/02\/13\/more-worrisome-circulation-figures-for-the-kansas-city-star\/) subscription revenue to stay afloat. This in mind, note the screenshot I’ve embedded below, comparing how a Twitter Blue-participating *Star* article appears within a desktop browser - without Twitter Blue vs Twitter Blue.\n\n![Kansas City Star Twitter Blue Comparison](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/ATS5Q3ok.png)\n\nCaptures of each respective webpage demonstrate that Twitter Blue exempts a reader from about half of the content weight of the non-Blue-authenticated render[^4]. Old school banner ads account for a portion of the missing content, but at least three elements for converting visiting readers to paying subscribers make up for most of it, I’d wager. None of what’s gone is content anyone on Earth *wants* to see, mind you, but frankly, it’s disrespectful of the paper’s classically villainous, [recently bankrupt](https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2020\/07\/16\/business\/media\/hedge-fund-chatham-mcclatchy-postmedia-newspapers.html) corporate overloard to opt it in with a program fundamentally designed to *intentionally forgo advertising engagement*. \n\n![See Your Impact - Twitter Blue](https:\/\/user-images.githubusercontent.com\/43663476\/144753270-c9687e0d-1307-41ba-b403-990923d70acf.png)\n\nTony Haile, if you’re reading this, you can exhale now. Yes, [the *theory* behind Scroll, and now “Ad-Free Articles” in Twitter Blue](https:\/\/help.twitter.com\/en\/using-twitter\/twitter-blue-ad-free-articles), suggests that the fifteen cents I’ve earned the *Star* so far (the graphic above can be found in the “See Your Impact” selection within one’s Twitter Settings) will be paid directly *to*… Whom, exactly?\n\nThe answer offered by Twitter, Inc. to the question of “How does my ad-free reading support journalism?” (asked of themselves:)\n\n> Each month, we pay publishers within the Twitter Blue Publishers Network based on the content you and other Twitter Blue subscribers read ad-free through Twitter Blue. Our model is designed to help publishers continue to fund the journalism you love to read.\n\n*Publishers*. I suspect that means cash-desperate McClatchy and *not* *The Kansas City Star*. All to be done at the moment, at least, is to ask ourselves how much of that cash will ever be seen by the paper. \n\n![Bookmark Folders - Twitter Blue](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/VyMNqr7V.png)\n\n## Bookmark Folders\n\nBookmarks and **Bookmark Folders** represent yet further evidence that someone at Twitter, Inc. *actually uses Twitter* (or perhaps has a friend or family member.) Technically, they also represent one of few core functions exclusive to Twitter’s own clients. (Consider: Tweetbot even supports polls, now.) However, like the Thread Reader and “Custom Themes,” Bookmark Folders, too, feel like an afterthought shoved in the bundle an hour before a deadline. Specifically, their color-coded icons look like placeholders for custom images… which aren’t supported, and they represent 0 additional function as curatorial\/archival tools (no exporting\/aggregating\/or sorting, even) beyond simply nesting bookmarks into… folders.\n\n![Themes & Icons - Twitter Blue for iOS](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/935pp2QS.png)\n\n## Icons & “Themes”\n\nEven greater heights of half-assery have been achieved by what Twitter describes as “[exclusive app icons and colorful themes](https:\/\/blog.twitter.com\/en_us\/topics\/product\/2021\/twitter-smarter--twitter-harder-with-twitter-blue).” Here, I must finally give in and compare Twitter Blue with Tweetbot directly. \n\nhttps:\/\/twitter.com\/neoyokel\/status\/1467422017527951366\n\nAbsolutely zero effort has been expended thus far in recharacterizing what Web Twitter still calls “Colors” as “Themes,” and the only *exclusivity* in the icon options is that some are seasonal, or otherwise time-limited, for what possible purpose I cannot conceive. This from a company of more than 5000 full-time employees. \n\nIn contrast, from a full-time team of two - both of whom suffered through bad COVID infections, this year - Tweetbot now includes an even further broadened spectrum of app-wide themes and 19 app icons in total, including, yes, at least two very cute, limited-time seasonal options. \n\nhttps:\/\/open.spotify.com\/episode\/0ImyC2Twm5qyx9lxmcKmkP\n\n## All Users ~~are~~ Should Be Powerusers\n\nThe episode of *End User* embedded above is one of the only podcast episodes I’ve ever made which I actually find *too painful* to listen back to[^2], but I still think it’s valuable. There’s a specific bit of the conversation between [@alisonbuki](https:\/\/twitter.com\/alisonbuki) and I in which the term “Poweruser” is actually thrown around regarding my own use of Twitter Lists, Tweetbot, and a few other *Hax* to consume content *deliberately*. I think I failed somewhere in my portrayal of this curation and miscommunicated the nature of what I was trying to get at by “making use of the tools available to you.” Regarding the actual manhours involved in the configuration I was trying to evangelize, I think I’ve spent more time trying to describe the effort than I have actually configuring my own content intake. \n\nLong before I was [follow-limited](https:\/\/bit.ly\/dbfollow) in 2017, I lived entirely in my [Twitter Lists]()https:\/\/twitter.com\/NeoYokel\/lists), the largest of which I built up “organically” over time, by adding appropriate accounts one by one as I came across them. Thanks to Tweetbot, my equivalent of the native apps’s Home timeline is a private List of ~200 accounts whose users represent the actual entirety of my adult social life, past to present. Then, there’s [The New](https:\/\/twitter.com\/NeoYokel\/lists\/the-new), which - I must admit - has grown beyond its original scope and sortof become my follow list, with enough exceptions that I consider it worthwhile to keep public. Then, there’s the newest - [my Meta-Media List](https:\/\/twitter.com\/i\/lists\/768458273141907456) - and the very oldest: my dear, weathered [Rolodex of Automotive Twitter](https:\/\/twitter.com\/i\/lists\/43457439). I keep Tweetbot in my dock and the native app on my device just for notifications, Spaces, and now Communities. That’s it! Yet, using this configuration, I *never* see content that seriously disturbs, shames, triggers, or otherwise upsets me beyond reason or expectation[^5], but am regularly exposed to a relatively diverse palette of perspectives, and just generally find my consumption\/engagement time on the service meaningfully spent. \n\nThe particular amalgamation of truly half-assed user experience features offered in Twitter Blue lend toward a narrative about this company which we collectively have continued to fall for literally *dozens* of times - often in immediate succession - throughout the fewer years of its history: that it *finally* has a morsel of what *might just become* a cohesive vision. Clearly, I am as susceptible to this as anyone considering how quickly I jumped to celebrating the fact that *finally*, Twitter had seen the humongous value to be imparted to its userbase by simply adding basic configurables like custom navigation and especially refining the essential curatorial tool that is Lists. \n\nWere I still a person who wastes my energy speculating on the real happenings within Twitter, Inc, though, an entirely different, much more realistic sounding theory arises after the analysis we’ve trudged through together in this post: every single item on Twitter Blue’s feature list represents the absolute bare minimum resource investment possible. If I had any money, I’d go on to bet that [Shihab Mehboob](https:\/\/twitter.com\/jpeguin) could have built from scratch every single developmental “addition” to the iOS app Twitter Blue includes in a matter of hours, though from experience, I seriously doubt he’d ever allow such lackluster work to reach even beta tester’s fingers. As far as Ad-Free Articles go, Twitter hasn’t even bothered to swap out all the Scroll branding. The fact that *I* had to surface the concept of Delete and Re-Draft to Twitter Employee brains for what all appearances indicate was the first time in that “FeedbackFriday” Twitter Space represents a truly sickening lack of effort. No, the story that aligns much more succinctly in the grander context is that Twitter Blue just happened to be the first disjointed, scatterbrained subscription service pitch to finally fall out the rectum of this miraculously bunk organization, but all you motherfuckers can talk about is Japple Notes Dorsey walking out, and *what it could mean*.\n\nSince I have now actually been personally and explicitly invited to share feedback regarding Twitter Blue, I suppose I’ll make some effort to send them this hyperlink. In that vein, I think I’ll end with some advice addressed directly to Twitter, Incorporated:\n\nHey Twitter! If you ever find yourself genuinely interested in selling a subscription product long term, as a mutual value exchange with your users, make all of Twitter Blue’s features available to all users, and ditch Scroll entirely. Instead of placing the bet on local newspapers like *The Kansas City Star*, it should be on *you* to **take the financial risk yourself, and offer, simply, a completely ad-free Twitter experience**. That might just be worth $2.99 a month.\n\n[1] Despite the fact that Tweeting via SMS has [since been disabled](https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2019\/9\/4\/20849865\/twitter-disables-sms-text-message-tweeting-jack-dorsey-ceo-hack).\n[2] I was just… rude.

I've thought a lot about what 15-year-old me could have possibly been thinking when I first Tweeting \"Watching Jimmy!\" from Twitter in the browser on my 2008 MacBook[^1] Of course, I've asked myself *which fucking Jimmy*, but not for years.

It was the only model year an aluminum-bodied Apple machine ever bore the name \"MacBook\" as opposed to \"MacBook Pro\" and the only said machine to have a removable battery, which - in my case - certainly encouraged [some absurd behavior](https:\/\/twitter.com\/NeoYokel\/status\/1470165080482451461).\n\n#software #meta #media","views":80,"updated":"2021-12-15T17:26:07Z","tags":["media","software","meta"],"type":null,"title":"David Blue's Twitter History","slug":"twitter-history","appearance":"norm","language":"en","rtl":false,"created":"2021-12-15T17:25:25Z","images":["https:\/\/i.snap.as\/SiFuVn9q.jpeg","https:\/\/i.snap.as\/9PEGgPYJ.jpeg","https:\/\/i.snap.as\/m4Ls06fs.png"],"paid":false},{"id":"ff4afadlsq9h2mbu","body":"![Speedy Frames Web Banner](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/ZnCTpWtH.png)\n\n## Federico Viticci's Apple Frames shortcut, optimized for super fast single-shot iPhone mockups.\n\n<!--more-->\n\nThe single element that's allowed me to go from publishing regular ole' iPhone screenshots to photorealistic mockups like you see embedded below is an absolutely ingenious, hugely powerful Siri shortcut by *MacStories* founder Federico Viticci called [Apple Frames](https:\/\/www.macstories.net\/ios\/apple-frames-2-0-faster-lighter-and-featuring-support-for-iphone-13-ipad-mini-ipad-10-2-imac-24-macbook-air-and-multiple-languages). Out of [all the shortcuts and workflows](https:\/\/raindrop.io\/davidblue\/siri-shortcuts-21598130) I've discovered, fiddled with, hoarded, and discarded since [iOS 12 beta](https:\/\/bilge.world\/siri-shortcuts-ios12-review), I think I can definitively say that it remains the most impressive use of iOS automation, ever, for reasons you're likely not all that interested in. \n\n![Speedy Frames](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/nszXla7t.png)\n\nAs it comes by default, [Apple Frames 2.0](https:\/\/www.icloud.com\/shortcuts\/d70654c055ee41bd8f72ebf0c29e0fa5) includes support for a whole bunch of languages and a broad spectrum of devices. Literally *every single step* is annotated with explanatory documentation, which represents hugely noble effort in and of itself. Its GUI selection menus, alone, allow for configuration of input and output targets and layout options (for multiple screenshots - horizontal, vertical, or in a grid.)\n\n *However*, this versatility means there *is* a wait involved. Emphasizing said wait (about 90 seconds from trigger to result for single-screen mockups on my 12 Pro Max) feels absolutely ridiculous considering how much longer it would take any other mockup generation method known to man to produce the same result, but a user like me - who's use of the shortcut is more often than not to generate mockups of a single screenshot I've probably just taken - might find themselves wishing they could set defaults for its menu selections and circumvent iOS' image picker and\/or share sheet entirely. \n\n![Export Modifications](https:\/\/user-images.githubusercontent.com\/43663476\/147858980-5f54e915-cc2f-493d-b680-846ceea8f2d6.png)\n\nAnd so... I did! With the new ability to edit shortcuts on macOS, it required far less time\/trial-and-error grief for me to perform the modifications listed below without breaking the whole shortcut than I expected, certainly. \n\n## Modifications\n\n1. I deleted all of the annotations in `Comment` form. They’re a testament to Federico’s diligence and huge contribution to personal automation with iOS… but they’re also just extra text.\n2. I replaced the `Find Photos Where` action with `Get Latest Photos` with the `Include Screenshots` toggle ON and the retrieval limit set to just one. \n3. I deleted the entire export preferences menu and replaced it with actions that save the result both to a specific iCloud Photos folder for frames and a corresponding iCloud Drive folder.\n\n![Local Frames Folder](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/VXYQyfpe.png) \n\nThe [**resulting shortcut**](https:\/\/routinehub.co\/shortcut\/10775) generates a mocked up version of the last screenshot taken on the host device and saves the image to a specified iCloud Photos album and iCloud Drive folder. (You will be asked to specify these upon installation.) In my experience so far, this process requires an average of ~5-7 seconds from trigger to result[^1] (vs 90+ seconds in Apple Frames 2.0's default configuration) and works fairly reliably *so long as one runs it immediately after taking the subject screenshot*. Note the incorrectly-oriented results in the screenshot of my own dedicated Frames album, above. I'm sure it doesn't actually have anything to do with the *duration* between capture and running the shortcut, but I'm not technically adept enough (nor particularly compelled) to determine the real cause. \n\nhttps:\/\/imgur.com\/gallery\/dwn4CnX\n\n## Tapping Back\n\n(You need only continue if you're interested in triggering the shortcut with [Back Tap](https:\/\/support.apple.com\/en-us\/HT211781).)\n\nI must acknowledge that what I'm about to describe is *blatantly* hypocritical given how much bitching about consumer tech's excess I've been purveying, but - for the past few weeks of living with my Speedy Frames shortcut - I have committed 100% to mocking up *all* shared screenshots - even those sent to friends and family. Obviously, a native automation trigger fired by screen capture would be particularly handy, here, but if we're using Back Tap as a trigger, we could theoretically achieve the same end by inserting a `Take Screenshot` action at the beginning of the shortcut except... It doesn't work. I've no idea why, but such a setup *exclusively* produces incorrectly-oriented results.[^2] Anywho, mocking up every single screenshot you've *taken* is just that much more excessive than those you actually intend to *share*, in my mind.\n\nhttps:\/\/youtu.be\/SKc4OZa2W8o?t=74\n\nFor those like me who've found Back Tap physically confounding, I created [the video embedded above](https:\/\/youtu.be\/SKc4OZa2W8o) to demonstrate the actual *mechanical* action required to trigger it.\n\nhttps:\/\/twitter.com\/neoyokel\/status\/1471883295042510859\n\nI've left it set to `Double Tap` for the majority of the time and have found it suitable. If you find yourself *really enjoying* the sensation of tapping the back of your phone, you might even set `Triple Tap` to `Screenshot` so that you can create a mockup with just a series of 5 taps.\n\nTechnically, there is much optimization to be done beyond this point - if you're using an older device or find even five seconds too long a wait for your mockups, you might try trimming Speedy Frames further by removing unneeded device and language components.

It was in 2017, amidst the shock that the Tump Presidency was *actually going to happen* [^1], that I happened to hear about his pick for Secretary of Education, Betsy DeVos, whom had just 18 months prior led myself and some twenty thousand other poor souls in a most capitalist prayer to the Christian God for prosperity at her pyramid scheme’s ultimate “superbowl” gathering in Cincinatti. I had decided to “infiltrate” AMWAY under the ridiculous assumption that I might be able to contribute some new insight in writing critically about what I might witness. (In truth, I found my experiences that summer so utterly traumatic, existentially, that I never was able to do so.) I don’t know what consequences of her ascension to the Lord of American Schooling I expected to happen, but I was pretty hysterical about it - that is, more unhumorously alarmed about some grander world happening as I’d ever been by a long shot. For the first and only time in memory, I felt compelled to take some sort of malicious, obscured action - to organize somehow for a purpose other than to be publicly critical of this person, and to use my knowledge about digital media to the fullest possible extent to scrutinize her administration’s every movement and to be prepared, even, to take some sort of real action if she… well, I don’t know. I *didn’t* know anything, really, about anti-government organization, generally, but I was not acting rationally in the slightest.[^2]\n\n![White Sapphire](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/aNADRjvK.png)\n\nI’m bringing this up for a few reasons, and the fact that the very first digital decision of my personal hysteria was to set up a private Telegram channel is telling, though I can’t recall just how much or how little I actually knew about it at the time. I launched myself back to the channel’s very beginning (easier to do with regular URLs than in any other service I’ve ever encountered,) but was only able to bring myself to dig just long enough to grab the utterly absurd photograph above… Though I certainly did not consider myself actively *interested in automation* at the time,[^3] Telegram’s infamous bot ecosystem proved so prevalent (and accessible,) that I was able to configure at least three bots on that channel within days of first establishing it: a repeater hooked to DeVos’ Twitter account, an RSS-powered bot watching the main feed of a website set up by Senator Elizabeth Warren called [*DeVos Watch*](https:\/\/www.warren.senate.gov\/oversight\/devos-watch), and another republishing everything from [the Department of Education’s press releases feed](https:\/\/www.ed.gov\/news\/press-releases). \n\nhttps:\/\/twitter.com\/ammnontet\/status\/1449594872139186181\n\nWas any of it genuinely useful in helping me maintain *Action Readiness* in hypothetical defense of American education? Most certainly not. It was, however, genuinely *comforting* to have such diligent, automated minions keeping watch - to have a centralized, private, reliable, and purely-chronological feed of information in a super-handy location, regardless of whether or not it was usable. As I began to unconsciously integrate Telegram into my day-to-day online life on both of my PCs and my iPhone, the usefulness of my private channel for *other* applications became rapidly apparent. On iOS, not even dedicated file managers like DEVONthink are capable (or *willing* might be a more accurate term) of handling the diversity of data Telegram will happily pass on for you, *especially* through the Share Sheet.\n\nhttps:\/\/twitter.com\/NeoYokel\/status\/1442554265956986882\n\n## Drafting\n\nI have used this “flow” so extensively for so long that it has come to define the whole of the abstract method in my muscle memory. Observe me browsing the web on my phone in an exhausted or particularly distractible state and you’d probably catch at least one or two completely irrational, inexplicable instances of sharing to my “[Saved Messages](https:\/\/telegram.org\/blog\/albums-saved-messages)” Telegram channel, which would be problematic for just about any other link-saving service. Add too many links to Safari’s Read Later list and you’ll end up crashing the browser on your Mac. I don’t even feel comfortable sending links willy nilly to the brilliant bookmark managing\/curatorial service Raindrop, these days, after finding out that my [Reading List feed](https:\/\/raindrop.io\/davidblue\/reading-list-13380406) has *actual daily followers*, but there are zero consequences to sending ultimately-worthless or duplicate links to my personal Telegram channel, which has no content limit and is instantly and competently searchable.\n\n![Send to Telegram Drafts Action](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/p3K96LiX.png)\n\nOver the years, I’ve discovered a bunch of other uses for the Saved Messages channel. As demonstrated in the screenshots embedded above, the [Send to Telegram Action](https:\/\/actions.getdrafts.com\/a\/18E) for my writing app, Drafts, utilizes Telegram for iOS’ Universal Links support (in the format `tg:\/\/…`) to instantly send the whole text of the current document in Drafts to a Telegram channel of one’s choice. I suspect this was intended to streamline posting for admins of public channels, but I’ve used it to quickly “back up” work as well as to transfer edits directly to my (Windows-running) PC. By adding `&to=+[my phone number]` to the end of the action’s URL, I was able to remove the single, unnecessary step of choosing the destination chat. Because text messages are automatically split at 5000 characters, though, I usually depend on the [Share as Markdown File Action](https:\/\/actions.getdrafts.com\/a\/1V4) (the output of which I also send to Saved Messages through the Share Sheet) for the latter function. Anecdotally I’ve also used this method literally just to inspect unknown content passed to the Share Sheet because it’s often **faster than Quick Look** to share to my Saved Messages channel and then immediately open it in the app. (Hilarious, I suppose. Mostly sad, these days.)\n\nI found my inspiration for this Post in replying to a [thread on the Automators.fm Discourse forum](https:\/\/talk.automators.fm\/t\/equivalent-to-drafts-but-for-windows\/6159) regarding a Windows equivlalent to the same Mac\/iOS\/iPadOS app Drafts mentioned above. I suppose my reply was a bit off-topic, in retrospect, but still worth including:\n\n> I have been using [**Telegram**](https:\/\/desktop.telegram.org\/), of all things for years. Notably, if you hit Ctrl + 0 from *anywhere* in the Windows client, you and your cursor are taken to the compose field beneath your personal \"Saved Messages\" channel, which is searchable, has an extremely high per-message character limit (after which it just automatically splits,) and is ridiculously reliable in saving \"drafts\" live as you're typing. As in... I have actively tried to lose characters by killing the application and then logging in on my phone and have yet to accomplish losing a single one (among other advantages: zero formatting added to plain text by default - not even line breaks - no total file limit and *2GB* per file limit uploads, absurdly cross-platform, literally more reliable than SMS in poor network conditions.) You can immediately reenter a sent message with `↑` to edit, copy it, escape with just `Esc` and then paste to start a new revision. \n\nThe feature within Telegram that makes this whole usecase worthwhile was introduced in [June, 2016](https:\/\/telegram.org\/blog\/drafts), and is entitled - appropriately - “Drafts.” Unlike the Drafts function in Twitter’s various native clients, for instance, Telegram’s really is impossible to fool, though it’s not perfect. [Markdown formatting support](https:\/\/telegra.ph\/markdown-07-07) is inconsistent across Telegram clients - the iOS app being the most woeful - and the few keyboard shortcuts the app supports on iPad are not supported whatsoever on iPhone.\n\n## Universal Clipboard\n\nUsers familiar with the MacOS + iOS + iPadOS ecosystem should be well-acquainted with “[Universal Clipboard](https:\/\/support.apple.com\/en-us\/HT209460),” which instantly synchronizes clipboard content across Apple devices. More recently, Android + Windows users have supposedly had access to an [equivalent functionality](https:\/\/support.microsoft.com\/en-us\/topic\/seamlessly-transfer-content-between-your-devices-8a0ead3c-2f15-1338-66ca-70cf4ae81fcb#WindowsVersion=Windows_10). To my knowledge, though, truly cross-platform clipboard sync has yet to be realized.[^4] As someone who’s used iOS and Windows regularly - along with Linux, occasionally - for more than a decade, now, I’d put my full weight behind Telegram as the best available solution from (far too much) personal experience.\n\n![Security Considerations in Telegram for iOS](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/Qim9gsZZ.png)\n\nWhen first entering a new system, real or virtual, regardless of OS, my very first step upon completion of its setup process has for years been to install Telegram, largely because all of my passwords for any\/all given services are huge - 30+ characters, at least - and complex enough that typing them out is both tricky and absurdly time-consuming. Authorizing a new Telegram client, however, is as simple as entering a one-time numeric passcode or scanning a QR code. Managing logged-in sessions (see: the far right screenshot embedded above) is quick, reliable, and includes a handy button to kill all but the current session. Thanks to these considerations, I feel quite comfortable sending myself passwords in Telegram, including .csv exports of whole password vaults, when it’s appropriate, even when working on systems I do not own. For this function, I can’t think of any other service\/software capable of replacing Telegram.\n\nFor day-to-day hyperlink sharing across my platforms, a variety of alternatives continue to come and go. The “Send to [device]” features represented throughout the palette of available web browsers - Firefox, Opera, Edge Chromium, Chrome, etc. - aren’t exactly reliable, in my experience. Most recently, I discovered a service specific to Hewlett Packard machines called “[QuickDrop](https:\/\/www.hp.com\/us-en\/solutions\/quickdrop-photo-sharing-app.html),” which - along with [its accompanying iOS app](https:\/\/apps.apple.com\/us\/app\/hp-quickdrop\/id1495071972) - does indeed allow me to send files, links, and text between my iPhone and Big Boy HP tower, though even my brief testing was filled with inexplicable prompts to reauthenticate and intermittent hangups, neither of which lend easily to regular use. I still maintain high hopes for [Snapdrop](https:\/\/snapdrop.net\/), which allows devices to share files and text over a *local* network from within any web browser, but it, too, is prone to frustrating hangups.\n\n![Drake Telegram Joke](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/2YhRCO0I.jpeg)\n\n## File Transfer & Cloud Backup\n\nAmidst the saga of my failed move to Portland spanning 2017-2019, I ended up losing *all* of my physical file storage - my old desktop and its hard drive, as well as 3 external drives containing a bunch of raw video I probably wouldn’t have gotten around to using, anyway, site backups for *Extratone*, and who knows what else. This loss taught me many grand, metaphysical life lessons (I hope,) but more practically, it affirmed a (admittedly gluttonous) truth about digital assets: if one truly wishes to make a file permanent, they must back it up in as many different places as possible.[^5] Perhaps the single most durable of these in my own computing life to date has been Telegram, which still has no per-account file upload limit and a per-file size limit of *two gigabytes*. The amount of pre-2019 work I’ve recovered solely thanks to Telegram is too great to enumerate here, but a rough draft of my [2018 Thankful for Bandcamp Mix](https:\/\/pod.link\/1437549809\/episode\/626a66d3f37807b69c59f56faa4d3b94) comes immediately to mind.\n\nHow exactly the service is able to maintain this virtually unrestricted storage, infrastructurally, borders on *don’t want to know* status. My own net server impact as a user is fairly difficult to estimate, but I’d bet real paper currency it’s between 50 and 100 GB, the vast majority of which I uploaded several years ago. Within any mainstream cloud file storage service - Dropbox, Google Drive, Box, iCloud, etc. - the cost of storing that amount *over time* would have added up to a not-insignificant chunk of change. I don’t want to advocate for Telegram as a cloud storage replacement for loaded cheapskates, but for working-class users on a $0 budget, it can be counted upon to keep large files in a relatively shareable, ultra cross-platform, and super-accessible manner. Students, especially, should take note.\n\n![Local Visibility and Voice Notes Publishing in Telegram for iOS](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/jfBVJqyw.png)\n\n## Community\n\nAt this point in my life, I must acknowledge to both readers and myself that **I am completely inept at community organization**. Especially when it comes to grand suggestions about how I suppose online communities might be ideally-run or just better served by particular software environments and configurations, I have literally received *zero* positive feedback, and not because I haven’t spent significant time positing publicly within the space. I spent the first half of my twenties trying to Peter Pan an independent online music magazine into existence, written by fresh-minded youths on the fringe at 140% throttle and managed to accomplish startlingly little for my all my invested time and gumption. The relevant component of that tale was a significant and all-out commitment from the beginning to run the whole project entirely within Discord. \n\nThe one absent activity throughout my years of Telegram use - save for intermittent correspondence during one relationship - has been *messaging other users*. I managed to find and participate in a few group chats - “[Telegram iOS Talk](https:\/\/t.me\/TelegramiOStalk)” and [*It's FOSS*' official channel](https:\/\/t.me\/itsfoss_official), notably - in my preparation\/research for this post. I’ve discovered plenty of new clever bits, like the button to jump to one’s nearest mention in a chat. I’ve also done my best to actually apply some [much-needed administrative attention](https:\/\/t.me\/columbiamo\/7774) to [my years-old attempt](https:\/\/reddit.com\/r\/columbiamo\/comments\/c4na0v\/local_telegram_group_chat_for_columbia) at creating the [definitive location-based local group chat](https:\/\/telegram.org\/blog\/contacts-local-groups) for the Mid-Missouri area where I live. Truthfully… It [hasn’t exactly gone as I’d hoped](https:\/\/reddit.com\/r\/columbiamo\/comments\/q0843f\/local_telegram_group_chat), but the failures have been all my own. I have yet to find a satisfactory balance in terms of moderation bots, so I’ve (as of this writing) resorted to manually removing the (significant) spam bot traffic by hand. Also, I must admit that I’ve never had to do so more than once or twice on *Extratone*’s public Discord, despite how much more circulation its public, open invite links have received.\n\nIn the past few weeks, I’ve had the privilege of watching *MacStories* relaunch their premium membership program, *Club MacStories*, on their incredible bespoke CMS. Part of this launch included their first exclusive community space, on Discord, which has been deeply rewarding for me, personally, but has also highlighted some serious limitations of that service which I not-so-long-ago [advocated so heavily for](https:\/\/bilge.world\/discord-slack-comparison). Namely, **hyperlinks to specific messages** within Discord are a hopelessly problematic endeavor. Even for a public server like *Extratone*’s, navigating to a message link [like this example](https:\/\/discord.com\/channels\/107272441889341440\/107272441889341440\/893958033401593898) will require any and all users to log in to Discord on the web, which - on mobile devices, especially - seems to struggle to navigate to the precise position of the subject message after you’ve successfully done so. Slack’s public message links are smart enough at least to prompt users to open them Slack for iOS, but Telegram’s system for message links in public channels and groups makes both services look daft.\n\n<audio controls>\n  <source src=\"https:\/\/github.com\/extratone\/bilge\/raw\/main\/audio\/Voice%20Notes\/DiscordFuckery.mp3\">\n<\/audio>\n\nTelegram message IDs are purely chronological from their channel\/group chat’s creation - the first message in a channel or group chat is `1` and the 15th is `15`. Together with the simplicity of channel\/group chat IDs, which are just their alphanumeric @ names, this format makes URL schemes for Telegram message links super malleable and easy to understand. The sixth message posted in the [@extratone channel](https:\/\/t.me\/extratone), for instance, can be found at [https:\/\/t.me\/extratone\/6](https:\/\/t.me\/extratone\/6), which even those without Telegram installed can view natively within their web browser. Within Telegram clients, said links are ultra-responsive, regardless of whether or not one had previously “joined” the channel or group containing the message. \n\n![Orange Noir Telegram Theme by Valespace](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/moymK7EY.png)\n\nIn *MacStories*’ case, there’s another essential point of reference. When I pinged the staff in their Discord regarding their experiences running [their now-abandoned Telegram channel](https:\/\/t.me\/MacStories), John Voorhees replied:\n\n> I don't really have anything to say about Telegram one way or the other. We ran it for a short time 5 years ago as an experiment and it didn't stick.\n\nI wasn’t yet a subscriber in those days, but little details like [behind-the-scenes voice messages](https:\/\/t.me\/MacStories\/281) are definitely missed. [Federico’s initial audio introduction](https:\/\/t.me\/MacStories\/39) describes a potential for the channel I wish more readers had enjoyed. They’re much more intimate, even, than the publication’s new exluclusive Town Hall events on Discord, which doesn’t make much sense, I know. \n\n![Live Streams and Video Chats](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/v1zhWmwN.png)\n\n### Streaming\n\nAdmittedly, another attention-grabbing feature that contributed to my finally getting around to this Post was [the introduction of \"Live Streams\" for channels and groups](https:\/\/telegram.org\/blog\/live-streams-forwarding-next-channel) (really just a slight augmentation of their [\"Voice Chats 2.0\" features](https:\/\/telegram.org\/blog\/voice-chats-on-steroids)) at the very end of this past August. Discord, of course, was way ahead of Telegram in implementing Voice Chats and Screen Sharing [back in October of 2017](https:\/\/youtu.be\/mMloc55o1jc), and it's long since become one of the services' core features. However, *recording* live content of any kind is not natively supported, though there is a [handy utility bot named Craig](https:\/\/craig.chat) who can accomplish this for you. For the sake of transparency, I should admit that not a single one of my live streams on Discord has actually included any viewership, but I have participated in a handful of others’ and viewed a couple dozen.\n\nhttps:\/\/twitter.com\/NeoYokel\/status\/1448837428534521858\n\nFor the past few months or so, participating in any sort of voice or video chat in Discord desktop has led to [a spectacular relaunch loop](https:\/\/twitter.com\/NeoYokel\/status\/1448837428534521858) that can only be solved by reinstalling the application, entirely.[^7] It’s not that Discord for iOS’ now full support for such streaming - both in terms of participation and simple viewership - isn’t impressive, but honestly, *Telegram* for iOS’ superiority should be immediately obvious to anyone who’s tried them both, recently. Not just in pure capacity’s sense, but in moderation tools, shared link customization, and, obviously, native recording support. I’ve embedded two recordings of different test streams of mine, below. [The first](https:\/\/t.me\/extratone\/7054) (embedded in [YouTube form](https:\/\/youtu.be\/uhXZZBl0fn8),) was streamed from both my Surface Laptop 2 and iPhone 12 Pro Max.\n\nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=uhXZZBl0fn8\n\n[The second](https:\/\/t.me\/extratone\/7196) is a very brief recording (in native form [directly from *The Psalms*’ GitHub Repo](https:\/\/github.com\/extratone\/bilge\/raw\/main\/video\/TelegramiOSLiveStreamTest.mp4)) of a stream I did *just* from the share screen function of my phone, in the wrong orientation.[^8]\n\n<video controls>\n  <source src=\"https:\/\/github.com\/extratone\/bilge\/raw\/main\/video\/TelegramiOSLiveStreamTest.mp4\">\n<\/video>\n\nBelow is a screenshot of the recorded file’s metadata (as provided by Telegram for Windows.) \n\n![Telegram Live Stream Meta](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/oDQqSYHF.png)\n\nAs you might note, there’s definitely something to be desired from the quality of Telegram’s stream recordings, especially in its included audio. I find it a bit strange that it’s recorded in 48 kHz just to be compressed down to *46kbps*. When you’ve stopped a recording, you’ll receive both the video file and just the extracted audio in an .ogg file. Unfortunately, the latter is no less compressed than it is combined in the video file. (Both are sent to one's Saved Messages channel immediately upon stopping a recording, from where they can be forwarded virtually anywhere.) Aside from a boost in audio quality, though, Discord’s default 720p base resolution is matched by Telegram. Via server boosts, this figure can be upgraded significantly, though the end result is quite costly. According to [a not necessarily trustworthy site](https:\/\/clutchpoints.com\/discord-server-boost-cost\/), accounting for Discord’s [recent reduction in boost requirements](https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/discord\/posts\/4524749577592737), here’s the pricing laydown to boost a server (per month:) \n\n> …a total of $34.93 for Level 2 and $69.86 for Level 3. That’s $24.45 for Level 2 and $48.90 for Level 3 for Nitro subscribers.\n\nAmong quite a few other abilities, here are the extracted audio\/video requirements per server level **only**:\n\n1. 128kbps audio\/720p video upped to 60fps\n2. 256kbps audio\/1080p 60fps video\n3. 384kpbs audio\/no video boost\n\nSo, if I had the spare change to maintain a level 2 boost for *Extratone*’s Discord server, myself, I could do so for $34.93 per month, which would allow me to *stream* (not necessarily *record*) in 1080p\/60fps video and 256kbps audio to up to [50 viewers](https:\/\/support.discord.com\/hc\/en-us\/articles\/360040816151-Go-Live-and-Screen-Share) (as of this writing.) Theoretically, at no cost, I can stream with virtually identical features (though I prefer Telgram's) to my Telegram channel to [infinitely many users](https:\/\/telegram.org\/blog\/live-streams-forwarding-next-channel#unlimited-live-streams) in 1280p\/30fps with absurdly low-quality audio and share\/manipulate recordings natively\/instantly from within any Telegram client. If I were All Powerful, I would make all the members of my \"[Family Tech Support](https:\/\/bilge.world\/ios-15-family-review)\" iMessage group install Telegram on their devices so we could use it, instead. I would also make them collectively attend occasional live streams, where they could ask questions verbally of my demonstrations sharing my own screen, or even share their own screens to demonstrate an issue or provide context for a question. The reality, though, is that I do not expect any sort of anticipation for my personal live help events on any platform, which innately suggests Telegram over Discord, I'd argue, for when I *do* stream such content, given its total lack of investment.[^9]\n\n![Location Sharing in Telegram for iOS](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/FRj5GGPN.png)\n\n### Location Sharing\n\nOne of Telegram's most unique (and potentially powerful, I believe) community features is [Live Location Sharing](https:\/\/telegram.org\/blog\/live-locations) on its mobile apps. Borned by Siberian native developer [Roman Pushkin](https:\/\/twitter.com\/romanpushkin), LibreTaxi is the single truly exciting open ridesharing alternative I've ever encountered.[^10] As [an item for *CBC radio* from 2015](https:\/\/www.cbc.ca\/radio\/spark\/346-biometrics-audio-intelligence-and-more-1.3987746\/the-man-who-wants-to-out-uber-uber-1.3987987) (among other assorted coverage compiled [here](https:\/\/telegra.ph\/LibreTaxi-press-coverage-07-14) as of July, 2017) explains, it utilizes Telegram's live location sharing functions to act as a decentralized Uber\/Lyft alternative in the form of [a bot](https:\/\/telegram.me\/libretaxi_bot), which connects users needing a ride with users providing them, free of any fees or service charges. Discourse surrounding LibreTaxi has been silent for years, but [this channel](https:\/\/t.me\/s\/libretaxi_all) tracking all LibreTaxi orders in realtime is proof that it *really is* helping folks get around.\n\n<audio controls>\n  <source src=\"https:\/\/github.com\/extratone\/bilge\/raw\/main\/audio\/The%20man%20who%20wants%20to%20out-Uber%20Uber-CBC.mp3\">\n<\/audio>\n\nAs for the persistence of *Live* location-sharing, I can vouch for its reliability on the Android side, at least, as per my aforementioned experience with a partner who used Telegram and shared their location with me for both safety and convenience. As someone with the most immense possible privilege regarding safety and dating, I would also like to suggest sharing one's live location with a private Telegram group chat with friends as an alternative to services like [Tinder's Noonlight](https:\/\/www.help.tinder.com\/hc\/en-us\/articles\/360039260031-What-is-Noonlight-).\n\n\n\n\n![Chat Export in Telegram Desktop](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/TbPFRPnG.png)\n\n### Permanence\n\nI've long evangelized (and extensively used) Alexey Golub's [Discord Chat Exporter](https:\/\/github.com\/Tyrrrz\/DiscordChatExporter) to make beautiful, stylized archives of Discord channels and\/or entire servers for safekeeping. Telegram's native [Chat Export Tool](https:\/\/telegram.org\/blog\/export-and-more) came just a year after Alexey pushed [version 1.0 of the tool to GitHub](https:\/\/github.com\/Tyrrrz\/DiscordChatExporter\/releases\/tag\/1.0.0), in August of 2018. In features, they're very similar utilities: both can export in either stylized HTML or data-only JSON formats between infinitely-configurable time\/date constraints. Again, I wouldn’t know how much external backup of community activity actually weighs in the day-to-day operations of large online communities. I know I personally find it comforting to have a swift, polished method of exporting *text*, especially, living in this era of [blatant disregard for users of suddenly-abandoned online services](https:\/\/github.com\/extratone\/bilge\/issues\/79).\n\n![TG Colors](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/r0WpvFQr.png)\n\n## ~~Transparency~~ Opacity\n\nOne of my primary justifications for the time spent in composing this Post has to do with the immediately-available discourse surrounding Telegram on the web, which is wholly incomplete, at best. The main obstruction, from my perspective, is the subject of **encryption**. Even within publications as legitimate and frankly out-of-scope as *Forbes*, one can find an article like my chosen example, from February of this year, entitled \"[No, Don’t Quit WhatsApp To Use Telegram Instead—Here’s Why](https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/zakdoffman\/2021\/02\/13\/why-you-should-stop-using-telegram-instead-of-whatsapp-use-signal-or-apple-imessage).\" It was written to address a mass \"[exodus](https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/technology\/2021\/jan\/24\/whatsapp-loses-millions-of-users-after-terms-update)\" of users from WhatsApp after [a grandiose misunderstanding](https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2021\/1\/12\/22226792\/whatsapp-privacy-policy-response-signal-telegram-controversy-clarification)(?) of its Privacy Policy caused a noisy controversy ([catalyzed by Idiot Melon, himself](https:\/\/twitter.com\/elonmusk\/status\/1347165127036977153).) I've been unable to find the added\/altered text, itself, in my brief reading, but it's not as if the happening wasn't thoroughly covered elsewhere. It's not that I doubt the expertise of \"Cybersecurity Expert Zak Doffman\" when he notes \"Telegram’s cloud-based architecture is a serious risk when compared to the end-to-end default encryption deployed by Signal and WhatsApp, which also uses Signal’s protocol,\" nor that I do not believe the following details are as true as truth gets:\n\n> All group messages on Telegram are only encrypted between your device and Telegram’s cloud, your message history is stored on Telegram’s cloud, and if you ([unwisely](https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/zakdoffman\/2021\/01\/30\/stop-using-this-dangerous-whatsapp-setting-on-your-apple-iphone-or-google-android-phone\/)) transfer your WhatsApp chat history to Telegram, then this is also stored on its cloud. Make you sure understand that Telegram has the decryption keys to any of your data that you store on its cloud...\n\nTo this argument and the many variations of it present in Telegram for iOS' [App Store reviews](https:\/\/apps.apple.com\/us\/app\/telegram-messenger\/id686449807), [obscure German PeerTube servers](https:\/\/tube.tchncs.de\/w\/2d958ef9-1be4-477c-bc13-852ec6391487), and even within [public chats on Telegram, itself](https:\/\/t.me\/crackheadlegit\/409), my formal response for the record is: *Okay! Affirmative! Received and understood!* I must acknowledge - given my own introduction to the service, narrated above - that Telegram's brand is vaguely associated with privacy and security. I can see that the second of nine duckies in the Ducky Grid on the root of telegram.org sits above the subhead \"**Private**\" and a caption with the following claim: \"Telegram messages are heavily encrypted and can self-destruct.\" (The seventh ducky's subhead is \"**Secure**.\") Continuing on in Doffman's *Forbes* article, we find an overview of several vulnerabilities found throughout Telegram's native clients by Dhiraj Mishra - surely they with the most ghastly typographical preferences in all of cybersecurity - on their blog, *Input Zero*.[^6] The [specific example hyperlinked](https:\/\/www.inputzero.io\/2020\/12\/telegram-privacy-fails-again.html) concerns a bug in the MacOS client that resulted in \"the application leak[ing] the sandbox path where [a sent audio or video message] is stored in '.mp4' file.\" (The whole of the ghastly-typewritten summary is embedded below in screenshot form.)\n\n![Telegram Privacy - InputZero](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/a0xgY5cJ.png)\n\nJust to be clear, I am being sincere when I acknowledge that these are genuinely problematic issues that no doubt affected real Telegram users who depend upon its Secret Chat function. Even something so benign as the file path to local media storage on my device is not something I'd want piggybacking my otherwise-anonymous, NDA- and\/or law-breaking messages to a journalist, for instance, but frankly, I don't know of any journalists who maintain public Telegram contacts, anyway. Come to think of it, I don't think I've *ever* seen a Telegram username publicly associated with a journalist. Indeed, the overwhelming majority of anonymous modern messenger service tip lines advertised by news organizations and news people which I've come across have all linked to Signal. In this particular case, then, Mr. Elon’s advice is sound.\n\nThe question I would like to surface: **what if I have no use for encryption or privacy across my purposes for Telegram**? *All* the channels I have ever engaged with have been public, and those private ones I’ve come across have either been shady crypto spam channels or shady porn channels. I realize this doesn’t exactly reflect positively on Telegram’s community, but - as I argued regarding Discord, long ago - why let the community or even the app’s branding, itself, confine how you use it as a utility?\n\n## A Hearty Foundation\n\nMy thinking while drafting this argument kept returning to a single, simple realization: **in age, Telegram is just two years ahead of Discord**, yet the various software distributed by the two organizations for their respective services represent quite disparate opinions in design terms. [Discord's desktop \"application\"](https:\/\/discord.com\/download) is an Electron app - [Telegram's](https:\/\/github.com\/telegramdesktop\/tdesktop) is virtually pure C++. [Telegram's iOS app](https:\/\/github.com\/TelegramMessenger\/Telegram-iOS) is mostly written in Objective-C (I'm to assume the 30.8% Swift code number on the repo as of this writing is mostly comprised of its widgets\/other recent iOS-specific integrations,) while Discord's is mostly ???. That is, because Discord's software is proprietary and the source is closed, all I can tell you is that it was written in React Native [as of December, 2018](https:\/\/blog.discord.com\/why-discord-is-sticking-with-react-native-ccc34be0d427). What I *can* tell you is that the current build of [Discord for iOS on the App Store](https:\/\/apps.apple.com\/us\/app\/discord-talk-chat-hangout\/id985746746) weighs in at 153.2 MB - significantly less than [Telegram's](https:\/\/apps.apple.com\/us\/app\/telegram-messenger\/id686449807) 185.1 MB. As I've noted plenty of times this year, **I am not a software developer** and therefore I can't promise you an app's initial payload size is actually all that relevant, but I was surprised to see Telegram wasn't slimmer than Discord, given how the two apps behave and my previous experiences with the platform, this year. \n\n![Storage Management - Telegram for iOS](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/BecGI6kg.png)\n\nReturning to the topic of their age… In its eight operating years, Telegram has embarked upon - and *actually completed*! - a gargantuan amount of projects. [Telegraph](https:\/\/telegra.ph\/), the CMS, its [Web](http:\/\/web.telegram.org\/), [Android](https:\/\/telegram.org\/android), and [Linux](https:\/\/itsfoss.com\/install-telegram-desktop-linux\/) clients, [embeddedable comments widgets](https:\/\/comments.app), its [online theme creation tool](https:\/\/themes.telegram.org\/), and on and on. Across their various types, Telegram’s software is universally simple, frugal, robust, and easy-to-use. Frankly, by contrast, Discord has done *nothing*? Though you’ll find openly-available solutions to accomplish much of what you can on Telegram in terms of moderation and other utilitarian concerns, like the aforementioned Craig bot, they are *all* the work of third-parties. While Discord the *company* is much more [transparently profiled](https:\/\/discord.com\/company) on the web than “Telegram FZ LLC,” the latter’s actual work is very well documented [across GitHub](https:\/\/github.com\/TelegramMessenger). \n\n![Telegram Desktop in Windows 11](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/DFQzGGeZ.png)\n\nIf you’ve stuck with me this far, perhaps it’s not too much to ask that we retreat a bit and ask ourselves **what we’d truly like prioritized in community chat software for 2021**. I really do show my age in my bias, here, as someone just old enough to have had extensive experience using IRC,[^11] I think there’s a less-than-adequately discussed division happening which its successors might benefit dwelling on. IRC was extremely frugal and it was easy to find a freeware or FOSS IRC client for one’s given platform which was well-optimized to sit in the background of their desktop operating system, completely untouched and barely acknowledged visually for days… weeks… months at a time. It was easy to find oneself a member of a dozen or so IRC channels for specific interests, projects, or organizations averaging a dozen or so actual updates\/pots per day, each. It was distinctly low pressure - many of my channel memberships functioned more like a wire service or, much more contemporarily, like an RSS aggregator, than a local party line.\n\n![Telegram for iOS Sharing and Notifications](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/FltrCV6Z.png)\n\nAs I see it, the ultimate shift dividing those solutions from these is the big fucking obvious one: IRC was conceived in a world where computers were mostly static objects associated by their intended use and physical dimensions with the referential, unmoving waypoints around which *we* orbited (the kitchen counter, the desk in your study at home, parallel series of workstations within the public library, etc.) The *entirely* contrasted needs of community engagement on a *handset* should have - in my opinion - done much more to break apart these communal contexts than they have. As prolifically and extensively as I have used Discord for iOS since before its official release, even, it is hopelessly compromised by its loyalty to the PC gamer’s paradigm. My 12 Pro Max is not just *capable* of keeping 100 Discord channels up-to-date in the background as I move about the world - it is all too fucking *eager*, and for not a one rational explanation. Going on down this vector eventually leads to an adjacent argument I’ll name but otherwise save for later: it is literally **over a decade** past the time when we should have ceased celebrating the fact that mobile computers had matched and outdone desktop computers! We have to snap the fuck out of our obsession with lugging desktop computing alongside our persons and refocus entirely (once again) on exploring what “mobile computing” can\/should mean, going forward. Please Gourd, help us do so ASAP.\n\nUnlike my heroes in most (if not all) of these tedious comparisons, I would *not* say Telegram is *the single software manifestation of total clarity in direction* within the subject, or anything, but in the area where it fails along with the rest of them, it has comprehensively iterated, invested in trial and error, and eventually produced tools that remedy the disparate gluttony. How swiftly and easily one can find one's installation full of media files, for instance, after *any* time spent exploring within its mobile apps.\n\nIt very well could have been mostly chance that contributed to Telegram's current lead in terms of thoughtful design decisions and development investment toward **mobile-first optimization**. Perhaps it was their comparative longstanding Hype Famine, especially in the United States, these past few years.  Maybe Discord hasn't built anything because they simply can't hear each other over the buzzwords overflowing their name in mainstream Discourse so abruptly thanks to The Big Virus. \n\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"60\" src=\"https:\/\/www.mixcloud.com\/widget\/iframe\/?hide_cover=1&mini=1&light=1&feed=%2FwiredUK%2Ftelegrams-pavel-durov-podcast-256%2F\" frameborder=\"0\" ><\/iframe>\n\nTelegram's story certainly *stands out*, though the voice of its creator, Pavel Durov, actually *telling* this story at length can now only be found [on *WIRED UK*'s MixCloud account](https:\/\/www.mixcloud.com\/wiredUK\/telegrams-pavel-durov-podcast-256), in [episode 256 of their *WIRED Podcast*](https:\/\/www.wired.co.uk\/article\/episode-256). Telegram was experiencing the peak of its presence in mainstream Western news media, who just *would not* let go of the fact that some leader of some terrorist organization recommended Telegram to someone for something at some point in time.[^12] Listening back, it's the nomadic \"decentralized\" beginnings of the organization - which I had forgotten entirely - which sounded a big, resonant Parallel Alarm in my brain: for very different reasons, [Bandcamp also operating without an office](https:\/\/bilge.world\/bandcamp-streaming-music) (from a public library, charmingly,) at that time. \n\n\"Can there only be one winner in the messaging wars?\" asks David Rowan, which Pavel - in the deliberate, uncomfortable-sounding tone he uses throughout the interview - answers first noting a *real truth* for actual users: we tend to end up with a billion, each grouped generally by types of relationships. iMessage is for your family and local friends, Facebook Messenger is for your school group project, IRC and Element are for your insane, privacy-obsessed Linux friends, and Telegram is for [unsolicited video chats of worm tubs](https:\/\/twitter.com\/ammnontet\/status\/1449594872139186181).*\n\n*For more, up-to-the-minute information on Telegram as well as Configuration files from me, see my [Telegram Raindrop Collection](https:\/\/raindrop.io\/davidblue\/telegram-20593542) (embedded below,) and\/or [this post's corresponding GitHub Issue](https:\/\/github.com\/extratone\/bilge\/issues\/228).\n\n<iframe style=\"border: 0; width: 100%; height: 900px;\" allowfullscreen frameborder=\"0\" src=\"https:\/\/raindrop.io\/davidblue\/telegram-20593542\/embed\"><\/iframe>\n\n------\n\n[1] I still have not accepted this, by the way. I’m still back there.\n[2] If I were to be 100% sincere, I might ask you to consider that this (hilariously brief) intent was a method of coping with the great existential truths I was facing for the first time.\n[3] I *definitey* was, though. For whatever reason, I do not remember associating the term “automation” with such activities, but I just found the “receipt” for my “purchase” of [IFTTT for iOS](https:\/\/apps.apple.com\/us\/app\/ifttt\/id660944635)… From July, 2013.\n[4] I am currently working on a less-than-instant solution using iCloud and CopyQ’s clipboard sync function.\n[5] I would’ve said “one can never have too many backups,” but the result of such thinking is ridiculously wasteful and not something I actually want to encourage.\n[6] I'm almost positive I've heard of\/been linked to this blog before, which is perhaps only notable in that I managed to keep my typographic opinions to myself.\n[7] Not that the process of doing so could be any easier on Windows.\n[8] It’s also worth nothing that [word of screen sharing framerate issues](https:\/\/t.me\/TelegramiOStalk\/104997) was circulating at the time of this recording.\n[9] Simulcast services like [Happs](https:\/\/happs.tv\/@DavidBlue) - which still exists, astonishingly - offer an intriguing utility for those intending to stream regularly and wishing to do so across multiple platforms. It does not, at the moment, support either Telegram or Discord.\n[10] Speaking as someone with [actual extensive ridesharing experience](https:\/\/dieselgoth.com\/volkswagen-jetta-sportwagen-tdi-review.html), notably.\n[11] Yes, there are some fellow Open Source Folks who’ve frankly struggled to let IRC go. It was an amazing protocol and will always be intertwined with the very first layed bricks of what we’d call the Social Web, but my friends… I sincerely think we should all try our hands at ham radio, instead. I think that would legitimately be a better use of our time than trying to implement two-factor authentication for IRC in this year of our spiteful Lourde 2021.\n[12] Disparaging Telegram for this is akin to shitting on Google because it is or was almost certainly the Taliban's favorite search engine, no?\n\n<!--comment-->\n\n#software #media","views":2393,"updated":"2022-02-08T05:04:18Z","tags":["software","media"],"type":null,"title":"I Trust Telegram","slug":"telegram","appearance":"norm","language":"en","rtl":false,"created":"2022-01-07T19:42:32Z","images":["https:\/\/i.snap.as\/jfBVJqyw.png","https:\/\/i.snap.as\/DFQzGGeZ.png","https:\/\/i.snap.as\/FltrCV6Z.png","https:\/\/i.snap.as\/p3K96LiX.png","https:\/\/i.snap.as\/Qim9gsZZ.png","https:\/\/i.snap.as\/FRj5GGPN.png","https:\/\/i.snap.as\/BecGI6kg.png","https:\/\/i.snap.as\/aNADRjvK.png","https:\/\/i.snap.as\/v1zhWmwN.png","https:\/\/i.snap.as\/oDQqSYHF.png","https:\/\/i.snap.as\/TbPFRPnG.png","https:\/\/i.snap.as\/a0xgY5cJ.png","https:\/\/i.snap.as\/9Bxz27ZX.png","https:\/\/i.snap.as\/2YhRCO0I.jpeg","https:\/\/i.snap.as\/moymK7EY.png","https:\/\/i.snap.as\/r0WpvFQr.png"],"collection":{"public":false,"alias":"bilge","total_posts":0,"title":"The Psalms","verification_link":"","description":"A <a href=\"https:\/\/davidblue.wtf\/db.vcf\">narcoleptic yokel<\/a> on software and culture.","style_sheet":"","views":177027,"monetization_pointer":""},"paid":false},{"id":"cfjf5u5ezeatcpm7","body":"![TelegramShortcuts](https:\/\/user-images.githubusercontent.com\/43663476\/151065307-88e3eaa0-ce93-4a89-b91c-c50fb649cc4d.png)\n\n## Shortcuts, bots, and some other methodologies discovered since my Big Telegram Post.\n\n<!--more-->\n\n<audio controls>\n  <source src=\"https:\/\/davidblue.wtf\/audio\/TelegramExtras.mp3\">\n<\/audio>\n\nSince I published “[I Trust Telegram](https:\/\/bilge.world\/telegram),” the messenging service has been *in the news*. Their launch of [Sponsored Messages](https:\/\/t.me\/s\/durov\/172) predated its publication, but I omitted any mention of them because I’d yet to see any meaningful effects on my own use of the service. All I’ll say now: nearly four months of daily use later, **this is still the case**. I’ve published a few Siri Shortcuts and a Drafts action in the interim, though, and thought these few additional discoveries worth another Post.\n\n## Siri Shortcuts\n\n![SeekTelegramMessagebyID](https:\/\/user-images.githubusercontent.com\/43663476\/152031447-334443d7-f038-4518-b65c-2e3305597bdd.png)\n\n### [Seek Telegram Message by ID](https:\/\/routinehub.co\/shortcut\/10930)\n\nAs [I noted in the Big Telegram Post](https:\/\/hyp.is\/miMJ-oOQEeyVkGegS1hLbw\/bilge.world\/telegram), navigating to\/referencing specific messages in Telegram is ridiculously easy due to its URL format: `https:\/\/t.me\/[Channel@]\/[Chronological Message ID]` My Seek Messages by ID shortcut will prompt you to set defaults for both Channel @ and message number upon installation. This could be useful for channel\/group administrators who need to reference\/update a message containing community rules, but specifying them is entirely optional. Otherwise, the shortcut will prompt you to enter a channel or group’s @ (minus the symbol itself,) followed by the numeric ID of the message you’re looking for. It will then copy the complete URL to the clipboard and open it in [Telegram Messenger for iOS](https:\/\/apps.apple.com\/us\/app\/telegram-messenger\/id686449807). I’ve found it handy when joining a new channnel\/group to quickly indulge my curiosity about its first few messages.\n\n![URLListtoTelegram](https:\/\/user-images.githubusercontent.com\/43663476\/152036933-ec106c9c-474d-4c5a-ab0e-ad7da6a97f7a.png)\n\n### [URL List ⇨ Telegram](https:\/\/routinehub.co\/shortcut\/10926)\n\nEffectively, this shortcut allows you to send links to a set of Safari 15 tabs to a contact of your choice in Telegram. It’s the singular one of the shortcuts shared in this Post that makes use of Telegram Messenger for iOS’ native Siri Shortcuts actions, and is therefore the most finnicky. In the first take of [my video demo](https:\/\/t.me\/extratone\/9978), it timed out trying to send 200+ links to my Saved Messages channel, but was successful in the second (the take I published) in sending just four links. Upon each run, the shortcut will prompt you to select a contact. The selection *must* be a phone number, ideally in International Format.[^1] It will then parse a list of URLs in your clipboard and send them one at a time via Telegram’s native action without opening the app.\n\n![ClipboardtoTelegramMessage](https:\/\/user-images.githubusercontent.com\/43663476\/152039638-f5e6e817-3b36-4cc2-bf74-184ad6dde9c4.png)\n\n### [Clipboard ⇨ Telegram Message](https:\/\/routinehub.co\/shortcut\/10929)\n\nThis one makes use of Telegram Messenger for iOS’ URL scheme, which isn’t really documented properly anywhere. \n\n`tg:\/\/msg?text=[Content]&to=[TargetPhone#]`\n\nUpon installation, the shortcut will prompt you to specify a target phone number in International Format. In the following runs, the shortcut will open Telegram to the conversation with the phone number you’ve specified (use your own phone number to set it to your personal Saved Messages channel) with the contents of your clipboard in the text entry field. You’ll need to hit `Enter` or tap the Send Message button to actually send the content.\n\n## Other Integrations\n\n### Drafts\n\nUsers of Agile Tortoise’s [Drafts for iOS](https:\/\/apps.apple.com\/us\/app\/drafts\/id1236254471) can use my [Send Draft to Telegram Saved Messages action](https:\/\/actions.getdrafts.com\/a\/1u5) to do exactly that. \n\nhttps:\/\/twitter.com\/NeoYokel\/status\/1488573937223094275\n\nLike the last Siri Shortcut above, the action utilizes Telegram’s URL scheme to send the contents of your current draft to a Telegram conversation with a phone number of your choosing. (Remember to change the action’s placeholder!) \n\nIf you’d like to specify a different conversation, [this action](https:\/\/actions.getdrafts.com\/a\/18E) published to the Action Directory by user maique omits the phone number bit of the URL scheme - `tg:\/\/msg?=[DraftContent]`.\n\n![TelegramTextExpanderGroup](https:\/\/user-images.githubusercontent.com\/43663476\/152044387-3302150d-a9b1-44a4-a2fa-a48d35d29faa.png)\n\n### TextExpander\n\nGroup and\/or channel administrators, especially, might find my public [Telegram-specific TextExpander snippet group](https:\/\/app.textexpander.com\/public\/de52c54ef169a96393d50cb4752706ce) to contain some useful inspiration. `.tid`, for example, will help you construct a Telegram message link by ID just as the first Shortcut in this Post will, while `.scheme` will replicate the app’s URL scheme.\n\n![TotandTelegram](https:\/\/user-images.githubusercontent.com\/43663476\/152045888-b10c1a1a-d924-479d-8f04-24d4efa688a1.png)\n\n### Tot\n\nIf you happen to have [Tot Pocket](https:\/\/apps.apple.com\/us\/app\/tot-pocket\/id1498235191) on your iOS device already, I’ve found it a particularly ideal place to compose Telegram messages with formatting and hyperlinks considering its similar format limitations. Drafts users can use my [Append to 7th Tot Dot action](https:\/\/actions.getdrafts.com\/a\/1uL) to send draft content to the last Dot directly. Some markdown formatting will need to be altered - #-headings aren’t supported by either Tot or Telegram, for instance - but formatting can be directly carried over to Telegram in Rich Text format by selecting all in Tot and copying, as displayed in the screenshots embedded above.\n\n## Bots \n\n![TelegramRaindropBot](https:\/\/user-images.githubusercontent.com\/43663476\/152048357-bba6ddb6-eb0d-4139-ba6e-79b69ef9651a.png)\n\n### [Raindrop.io Bot](https:\/\/t.me\/raindropiobot)\n\nAs far as I’m concerned, @OlegWock’s [Raindrop Telegram Bot](https:\/\/github.com\/OlegWock\/raindrop-telegram-bot) is an absolute must for any users of the Raindrop.io bookmarking service. Not only does it allow one to send Raindrop bookmarks directly to a chat when in inline mode (as demonstrated in the above screenshots) - it is also *the* quickest method of saving images, videos, and documents to one’s Unsorted Bookmarks list on an iOS-running device. As I [mentioned in the Big Post](https:\/\/hyp.is\/bGmFuoOgEeyp5F9tAvJq-w\/bilge.world\/telegram), Telegram’s sharesheet integration remains by far the least discriminate of any such integration on iOS.\n\n![RoseTelegramBot](https:\/\/user-images.githubusercontent.com\/43663476\/152051128-e6a3d557-e2d5-4c84-b881-a35825b73375.png)\n\n### [Rose](https:\/\/t.me\/MissRose_bot)\n\nI’ve gone through the standard gauntlet of freemium administration bots for [my experimental local Telegram group](https:\/\/t.me\/columbiamo). The one I think I’ve settled on, though, is by far the [best documented](https:\/\/missrose.org\/guide\/getting-started\/adding-rose\/) and most inuitive I’ve come across. Miss Rose comes conservatively-configured of the box in a sense that one will experience better results than its “competitors” in moderating a small group like mine just be leaving the defaults in place. My personal favorite functions are `\/notes` - which allows one to save group documents that can be recalled with `\/`or `#` - and `\/export`, which exports the entirety of one’s options (including those notes) as a .txt file. (See the rightmost screenshot embedded above.) \n\n## Other Insights\n\n<video controls>\n  <source src=\"https:\/\/user-images.githubusercontent.com\/43663476\/152056943-3fc9970f-491f-4060-bfb4-ba45731b4bc9.MOV\">\n<\/video>\n\n### Telegram as Task Manager\n\nI had absolutely no idea that [Reminders](https:\/\/telegram.org\/blog\/scheduled-reminders-themes) existed in Telegram until a few weeks ago. When sending to one’s Saved Messages channel, holding down on the Send Message button will display the option to `Set a Reminder`. Anything that can be sent can be added as a reminder, including - in my case - .exe files of programs I’d like to install on my PC later. Frankly, I can’t think of any other task management\/reminders application that offers this ability - paid or otherwise.\n\n![Telegram for macOS](https:\/\/user-images.githubusercontent.com\/43663476\/152087363-ab3fb744-d905-4128-ad9b-80a5a2e9530c.png)\n\n### The macOS App\n\nA recent update to the [Telegram for macOS app](https:\/\/apps.app.com\/us\/app\/telegram\/id747648890) has rendered it by far the most beautiful way to use the service.\n\n## Themes\n\nI’ve spent quite a bit of time archiving third-party Telegram themes, lately. Below is a list of installation links to some of my favorites which I’ll do my best to keep updated.

Certain proper nouns and a dozen or so quasi-localized dialectal terms in our day-to-day writing\/speech have been treated by the system's autocorrect as foreign objects, regardless of how frequently we use them. Technically, this isn't supposed to happen, but - if you've got the patience and the time - there's a native feature across iOS, iPadOS, and macOS that allows you to declare your own user dictionary called [Text Replacement](https:\/\/support.apple.com\/guide\/iphone\/use-text-replacements-iph6d01d862\/ios).\n\nhttps:\/\/youtube.com\/watch?v=4Pu4VCiApMU\n\nYou can find the Text Replacement menu on iOS - as pictured in the screenshot embedded above - by navigating to `General ⇨ Keyboard ⇨ Text Replacement` or (maybe) by tapping [this link](prefs:root=General&path=Keyboard\/USER_DICTIONARY). If you think you might use it often, I'd suggest installing [**this Siri Shortcut**](https:\/\/www.icloud.com\/shortcuts\/e6d56b3fe8bc40639a60f166315f255b) I created that navigates directly to the Text Replacement menu. To be honest, I’ve no idea what you’ll find there if you’ve never created a single entry and - since there’s no way to import or export from the menu - I’m not willing to delete all of mine to find out. \n\n![TextReplacementEntry](https:\/\/user-images.githubusercontent.com\/43663476\/152147580-9054ee94-7e04-4895-be1c-b0ca4209fd75.png)\n\nTap the plus (+) symbol in the upper right hand corner of this menu and you should find yourself on a screen identical to the one shown in the screenshot embedded above, with two text entry fields labeled `Phrase` and `Shortcut`. To simply define a phrase - like “Extratone,” for instance, we needn’t actually use the latter, though I almost always do. I *would* suggest making two entries for those terms that aren’t always lowercase\/uppercase - `Extratone` and `extratone`.\n\nMy suggestion: you needn’t waste too much time sitting and noodling over potential entries. Instead, try to notice the next time you encounter a frustrating misapplication of autocorrect. Add the Siri Shortcut I shared above to your homescreen so that you can quickly access the menu in this situation. Adding a single word shouldn’t take you more than a few seconds, this way.\n\nHere’s [the result](https:\/\/gist.github.com\/extratone\/3c7788e41d32958a04a2ab693fe0512c) of my continuing this practice for the past few years:\n\nhttps:\/\/gist.github.com\/extratone\/3c7788e41d32958a04a2ab693fe0512c\n\n## Text Expansion\n\nThe goal of this guide was to help those experiencing repeated incorrect autocorrect actions, but Text Replacement’s explicit purpose is also worth consideration. Similar in function to a favorite third-party app of mine called [Text Expander](https:\/\/apps.apple.com\/us\/app\/textexpander-keyboard\/id1075927186), you can also use Text Replacement to create text shortcuts to lengthy\/tedious\/otherwise difficult to replicate text strings. This includes emojis! As you’ll note in the Gist embedded above, my typing out moyai with replace the text “moyai” with “🗿.” In order to escape the shortcut and simply print the word “moyai,” all I need to do is tap the `esc` key on my keyboard or the `x` in the upper right hand corner of the autocorrect object. See this demonstrated in [my video guide](https:\/\/youtu.be\/4Pu4VCiApMU) and\/or [the GIF embedded below](https:\/\/imgur.com\/gallery\/K3EWBqh):\n\nhttps:\/\/imgur.com\/gallery\/K3EWBqh\n\nWhat I forgot to mention in the video is that the Text Replacement dictionary is persistent by default across iOS, iPadOS, and macOS via iCloud. You’ll find the menu in the last one at `System Preferences ⇨ Keyboard ⇨ Text`.\n\n![Text Menu in macOS](https:\/\/user-images.githubusercontent.com\/43663476\/152279207-96d4b8e2-2cd6-4393-a4fe-8f61abb0ab93.png)\n\nFrom here, you can actually Select All and drag the contents of the text menu to Finder, which will result in a file entitled `Text Substitutions.plist.` Technically, this *does* allow one to back up their Text Replacement configuration, although actually *restoring* said backup would have to be done by hand, term by term.\n\nhttps:\/\/imgur.com\/gallery\/EeTksyI\n\nhttps:\/\/twitter.com\/atnbueno\/status\/1506348606374170635\n\n<!--comment-->\n\n#software #configuration","views":1650,"updated":"2022-04-14T07:50:09Z","tags":["software","configuration"],"type":null,"title":"Text Replacement","slug":"text-replacement","appearance":"norm","language":"en","rtl":false,"created":"2022-02-02T23:56:36Z","images":["https:\/\/user-images.githubusercontent.com\/43663476\/152093082-5a6df76f-c1f1-45fa-a38a-d03f57a93c8f.png","https:\/\/user-images.githubusercontent.com\/43663476\/152147580-9054ee94-7e04-4895-be1c-b0ca4209fd75.png","https:\/\/user-images.githubusercontent.com\/43663476\/152279207-96d4b8e2-2cd6-4393-a4fe-8f61abb0ab93.png"],"collection":{"public":false,"alias":"bilge","total_posts":0,"title":"The Psalms","verification_link":"","description":"A <a href=\"https:\/\/davidblue.wtf\/db.vcf\">narcoleptic yokel<\/a> on software and culture.","style_sheet":"","views":177027,"monetization_pointer":""},"paid":false},{"id":"mo9yjaauypzh7esp","body":"![Post to Writeas Blog](https:\/\/user-images.githubusercontent.com\/43663476\/152098127-6408d6fc-8afd-482c-86aa-0bee8c1b0027.png)\n\n## A setup for posting to Write.as blogs directly using Siri Shortcuts, the Write.as CLI, and (optionally) Drafts for Mac.\n\n<!--more-->\n\nThough there is currently a [Write.as desktop application in the works for macOS](https:\/\/code.as\/writeas\/macos) and the web editor is certainly no slouch, I thought I'd attempt to take advantage of my newfound knowledge of [the Write.as CLI](https:\/\/github.com\/writeas\/writeas-cli), [Drafts Actions](https:\/\/actions.getdrafts.com\/a\/1u0), and [Siri Shortcuts](https:\/\/routinehub.co\/shortcut\/10981) on macOS to manifest one of my all-time dream integrations: publishing directly to write.as with [Drafts](https:\/\/apps.apple.com\/us\/app\/drafts\/id1435957248).\n\nTo start - assuming you already have the CLI installed - lets run `writeas help post` in our shell:\n\n![WriteasHelpPost](https:\/\/user-images.githubusercontent.com\/43663476\/152664380-32cf084e-bde1-4d59-85d0-9f15c2da78a7.png)\n\nFor my own use, I really needed to consider just two arguments, here: which blog I'm posting to and in which format. Since [my blog's CSS](https:\/\/github.com\/extratone\/bilge\/blob\/main\/Custom%20CSS.css) overwrites all but `monospace`, I always publish in `--sans`. Keeping this in mind, I allotted for these two options in my Siri Shortcut as customizations set on install.\n\n![ShortcutSetup](https:\/\/user-images.githubusercontent.com\/43663476\/152664543-028221a5-4359-4bdd-8701-15fc38dcb5b2.png)\n\nNow, whenever it's run, my shortcut will be running this command: `write-as post -c chaff --font sans` plus whatever input I've given it. By default, it will grab from the clipboard, but I'm going to use [a custom Drafts action](https:\/\/actions.getdrafts.com\/a\/1u0) to send input, instead.\n\n![DraftstoWriteasAction](https:\/\/user-images.githubusercontent.com\/43663476\/152664614-b53bc430-caf0-4ecd-9547-df324f6fe836.png)\n\nVery simply, this action simply calls a shortcut entitled \"Post to Write.as Blog (macOS)\" sending the [[[safe_title]]](https:\/\/docs.getdrafts.com\/docs\/actions\/templates#content-tags) of the Draft as the markdown title followed by a space and then the draft's [[body]].\n\n<video controls>\n  <source src=\"https:\/\/user-images.githubusercontent.com\/43663476\/152664747-1a6fce01-85d6-46ff-bd13-e41d33544c78.mp4\">\n<\/video>\n\n<!--comment-->\n\n#software #automation #configuration","views":785,"updated":"2022-02-13T00:53:30Z","tags":["software","automation","configuration"],"type":null,"title":"Automating Write.as Posts on macOS ","slug":"automating-writeas-posts","appearance":"norm","language":"en","rtl":false,"created":"2022-02-06T01:39:58Z","images":["https:\/\/user-images.githubusercontent.com\/43663476\/152664614-b53bc430-caf0-4ecd-9547-df324f6fe836.png","https:\/\/user-images.githubusercontent.com\/43663476\/152098127-6408d6fc-8afd-482c-86aa-0bee8c1b0027.png","https:\/\/user-images.githubusercontent.com\/43663476\/152664380-32cf084e-bde1-4d59-85d0-9f15c2da78a7.png","https:\/\/user-images.githubusercontent.com\/43663476\/152664543-028221a5-4359-4bdd-8701-15fc38dcb5b2.png"],"collection":{"public":false,"alias":"bilge","total_posts":0,"title":"The Psalms","verification_link":"","description":"A <a href=\"https:\/\/davidblue.wtf\/db.vcf\">narcoleptic yokel<\/a> on software and culture.","style_sheet":"","views":177027,"monetization_pointer":""},"paid":false},{"id":"2lvl3dvqmrwicc5o","body":"![iPhone Keyboarding Pointing Keyboard](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/6J3Tm3CN.jpeg)\n\n<!--more-->\n\n<audio controls>\n  <source src=\"https:\/\/davidblue.wtf\/audio\/2021.mp3\">\n<\/audio>\n\n*I am not funny anymore* feels as though it has finally achieved penultimate meaning as a longtime habitual phrase of mine - as in, I can no longer remember a tangible self without that sentiment always at the ready in a handy intercranial stash.

In case you can't be bothered, it doesn't take much scrutiny to note that all but *one* of these entries - [the second-latest](https:\/\/bilge.world\/uniiqu3-techno-is-black), debatably - are directly related to the Fucking Apple Phone. Indeed, The Year of our Lord 2021 saw me watch every single one of Apple's two billion special \"live\" events in their entirety, all the while marveling... screaming... at the overwhelming volume of completely indiscriminate hype that still pervades the greater *vaguely interested in consumer tech* online biosphere. I witnessed folks take days off work solely for the sake of these pre-recorded “live” events, listened to pre-show podcast gameshows involving real money bets on what might be discussed\/released during said events, and subscribed to two exclusive iOS-related publications: [Matthew Cassinelli’s newsletter](https:\/\/matthewcassinelli.com\/membership) and [Club MacStories](https:\/\/club.macstories.net).\n\n![Tweetbot Folder](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/LOcqBpbJ.png)\n\nSeparate the blogroll, I indulged resolutely in [a severe App Addiction](https:\/\/bit.ly\/dbapplist), published [a bunch of Siri Shortcuts](https:\/\/routinehub.co\/user\/blue), frequented [r\/Shortcuts](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/shortcuts) more than I ever thought I'd find myself doing so on Read It, subsequently investing more of my time than ever in personal automation on Apple devices, while also becoming [most critical of the practice](https:\/\/github.com\/extratone\/bilge\/blob\/main\/audio\/Voice%20Notes\/The%20Siri%20Shortcuts%20Industry.mp3). I first described myself as an \"iPhone Poweruser\" some four years ago, in [a rambly episode of *End User*](https:\/\/www.listennotes.com\/podcasts\/end-user\/siri-shortcuts-are-ios-12s--Vlsfa8engC\/) immediately following my original discovery of Apple's absorption of the automation app Workflow and its rebrand of their work into \"Siri Shortcuts\" [in the beta of iOS 12](https:\/\/bilge.world\/siri-shortcuts-ios12-review). If indeed this label was ever meaningfully appropriate to self-apply, it certainly should be, now. Before 2021, my knowledge of iOS as a platform was extensive, sure, but notably constrained to user considerations. I was completely unaware of any \"dev-facing\" interworkings. For instance, I now have a vague understanding of Apple's late push to change iOS' primary programming language from Objective-C to its own Swift thanks to my \"[investigation](https:\/\/twitter.com\/tapbot_paul\/status\/1421600511808229387)\" into why Tweetbot \"feels\" so different from its contemporaries. As per [my commitment to write the missing documentation for Bluetooth keyboard shortcuts support on iPhone](https:\/\/uikeycommand.neocities.org)[^1], I have even become familiar enough with SwiftUI to identify a given key command's result in source code.\n\n## Editorially\n\nThe most significant editorial initiative of the year was [my complete rewrite](https:\/\/github.com\/extratone\/bilge\/issues\/96) of [\/About](https:\/\/bilge.world\/about). In the interest of providing a much more succinct and informative logline, I took direct and obvious inspiration from [the About document](https:\/\/www.notion.so\/About-Platformer-22cd48a5514d404b9c2dd130d7724b93) Casey Newton drafted for his newsletter, [*Platformer*](https:\/\/platformer.news). I expected the process to take months on end, but the end product was mostly written in a single sitting. This excerpt is as close to a Statement of Purpose for *The Psalms* as I've ever come: \n\n> ...observing and selectively amplifying the characters, organizations, and stories surrounding the most abrupt, profound, and spectacular communicative renaissance in the history of the human species. Less abstractly, its beat is **wholly digital**, namely in **tools** (software, services, and methodologies) and **culture** (music, film, podcasts, and media) from a distinct lens established at good distance from California.\n\nAlso included is a list of important editorial considerations, most of which could be interpreted as complaints about the general state of \"technology media\" at present. It’s [up to you](https:\/\/twitter.com\/NeoYokel\/status\/1477105624978755584) to judge how well I’ve done at keeping them in mind, [publicly](https:\/\/mastodon.social\/@DavidBlue\/107545348469577371).\n\n![Editorial Considerations List](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/ao01CvrK.png)\n\nAs I said at the beginning of this Post, I’m going to miss being clever, but it’s become much more important to me to spend my time creating content that first and foremost provides **tangible value for real people**. I can't say I could've before imagined what a particular challenge composing guides\/tutorials\/documentation would be as a writing discipline. Frankly, I'm quite terrible at it. On this topic, I think my particular challenge, going forward into 2022, will be to make sure my continued improvement in this area benefits others more than myself as simply another arrow in my writing quiver, if you will.\n\nhttps:\/\/twitter.com\/HaggardHawks\/status\/1480865684276064256\n\nOne of the far too many projects my todo list accumulated over the year, the \"[Please Fuck With This License](https:\/\/github.com\/extratone\/fuckme)\" - my very own [public domain-equivalent license](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Public-domain-equivalent_license) - started as a joke, more or less, with the footer text of [my very first website](https:\/\/iowa.neocities.org): \"PLEASE STEAL FROM THIS WEBSITE.\" Extrapolating this pubescent sentiment of mine into a minimally-ideological, yet fully-formed intellectual property license has been yet another total departure from my writing comfort zone into the domain of *the legal*.\n\n> The originator of the matter may be held entirely responsible for consequences upon any being or other distinct matter legally, ethically, morally, spiritually, etc. All forms of correspondence re: the matter to which this document is attached - including feedback, criticism, praise (due and undue,) general bereavement, damnation, condemnation, complaint, advice, advisement, assistance, counsel, guidance, input, recommendation, suggestion assistance, briefing, coaching, mentoring, priming, prompting, teaching, tutoring, caution, alarm, etc. is not only **welcome** but ***encouraged*** as per the core ethos of this document.\n\nI'd like to think the sentiment I'm going for, here, feels entirely complementary to the thoughts I've expressed about creative existence, allegorically, in the past year, but I could just be insane.\n\n### The Git Bit\n\nEighteen months ago, I had no idea what Git was. Somehow, in the relatively short interim, I have managed to integrate it into the very foundation of my creative life. Every bit - if not more - of *The Psalms* substance exists on [its GitHub repository](https:\/\/github.com\/extratone\/bilge). It's rather disorganized, but then again… so is this blog, and so am I. For instance, I’ve been intending to write [a dedicated post](https:\/\/github.com\/extratone\/bilge\/issues\/245) on the subject of how I’ve integretated Git into my creative life for more than a year, now. In theory, this means my revisions are tracked via [commits](https:\/\/github.com\/extratone\/bilge\/commit\/main), though to be honest, I’ve yet to make much use of them. \n\nOn iOS, [Working Copy](https:\/\/apps.apple.com\/us\/app\/working-copy-git-client\/id896694807) has been absolutely invaluable considering how much writing I’ve done on my phone this year. So too has been [Drafts](https:\/\/apps.apple.com\/us\/app\/drafts\/id1435957248).\n\n## Technically\n\nFootnotes have finally been re-implemented! Though they still screw up line spacing.[^2] Thanks to [changes to the Write.as platform](https:\/\/discuss.write.as\/t\/new-in-labs-tiny-write-as\/3081), you can now [view The Psalms without any of my CSS](https:\/\/tiny.write.as\/bilge) if you can’t stand looking at it, but that’d be a shame, in my opinion. Nevertheless, the footer has been amended to include a “Tiny” link at first position. A link to [*Extratone*’s Telegram](https:\/\/t.me\/s\/extratone) has replaced [the Discord link](https:\/\/bit.ly\/extratone) as per [my newfound focus on the former](https:\/\/bilge.world\/telegram). It’s my hope that the addition of [Siri Speech Synthesis](https:\/\/bilge.world\/siri-tts) at the top of each post might make *The Psalms* more accessible, even if just for those who find my words too verbose to read.\n\nGoing forward, *The Psalms* will be integrated with the new Discussions platform in the Write.as suite, [Remark.as](https:\/\/discuss.write.as\/t\/remark-as-privacy-first-portable-comments\/25). Here's [a link to my profile](https:\/\/remark.as\/extratone). You'll start seeing this link at the bottom of posts:\n\n<!--comment-->\n\nWrite.as Pro users (exclusively, for the time being at least) will be able to comment on my work via these links.\n\nI wanted to make this review significantly more expansive, but it's well into February now, so I think I'll leave it be and focus on further pursuits. If you'd like to see the full extent of what I intended to include - including amendments to posts with updated news - see [this post's corresponding GitHub Issue](https:\/\/github.com\/extratone\/bilge\/issues\/284).\n\n---\n\n[1] Which I will *not* be discussing further in this particular Post. \n[2] CSS wizards with a solution to my problem: I'd love to [hear from you](https:\/\/davidblue.wtf\/db.vcf).\n\n#meta","views":718,"updated":"2022-02-08T06:43:12Z","tags":["meta"],"type":null,"title":"The Psalms’ 2021","slug":"2021","appearance":"norm","language":"en","rtl":false,"created":"2022-02-08T06:30:39Z","images":["https:\/\/i.snap.as\/ao01CvrK.png","https:\/\/i.snap.as\/6J3Tm3CN.jpeg","https:\/\/i.snap.as\/LOcqBpbJ.png"],"collection":{"public":false,"alias":"bilge","total_posts":0,"title":"The Psalms","verification_link":"","description":"A <a href=\"https:\/\/davidblue.wtf\/db.vcf\">narcoleptic yokel<\/a> on software and culture.","style_sheet":"","views":177027,"monetization_pointer":""},"paid":false},{"id":"ij9a4u2k804lk3au","body":"![ZalgoTextinaKeyboardShortcut](https:\/\/user-images.githubusercontent.com\/43663476\/153733572-c620df01-c54f-4b04-950f-48cf1cc74b9d.png)\n\n<!--more-->\n\nEarlier this afternoon, I put out [an ask on Twitter](https:\/\/twitter.com\/NeoYokel\/status\/1492591057950892040) regarding how to use JavaScript to create a native Drafts Action for Zalgo Text. Delightfully, tagging @draftsapp in that post paid off, for just a bit ago, Greg - Drafts’ sole creator and guardian - [*actually replied*](https:\/\/twitter.com\/draftsapp\/status\/1492645727729766400) with a link to [**an action he’d just posted**](https:\/\/directory.getdrafts.com\/a\/1vM) called “Zalgos.”\n\nhttps:\/\/twitter.com\/draftsapp\/status\/1492645727729766400\n\nObviously, I installed it immediately, and configured it to `^ + ⇧ + Z`.

I created it largely to interact with NeoCities over iOS, but frankly I was already doing so more effectively than the Action Group will ever offer with the iOS app [Koder](https:\/\/apps.apple.com\/us\/app\/koder-code-editor\/id1447489375). It’s odd and a bit out of support, but incredibly useful and supported all the way back to iOS 9. Unfortunately, many of its functions - like deleting remote files, for instance - will result in a crash on modern devices. Also unfortunate - I’m afraid my Action Group doesn’t offer solutions to these problems. On iOS, it’s limited in function to pushing files to your WebDAV server and then opening them in a web browser. \n\n![NeoCitiesActionGroup](https:\/\/user-images.githubusercontent.com\/43663476\/152169590-518d1043-c02b-49a1-9f19-76699362ab96.png)\n\nIt wasn't as simple as HTML encoding the [draft] content with percentage signs, either. In order to produce [satisfactory results](https:\/\/davidblue.wtf\/drafts\/A350D578-1CFA-4B5A-8655-74F6B3AD72AE.html), I had to wrap every output in a very custom HTML template which I would very much encourage you to personalize before using (considering especially that it includes my personalized footer links and [colors](http:\/\/bilge.world\/colophon).) You can view that template in full [here](https:\/\/davidblue.wtf\/drafts\/8700B562-8716-489A-B554-641549B6B3E5.html). To be honest, I can’t quite recall where I found the original, but it was probably either included with a native Drafts action or found among [Stephen Millard’s TAD library](https:\/\/www.thoughtasylum.com\/tadpole).\n\n![toDraft-UUID](https:\/\/user-images.githubusercontent.com\/43663476\/153755878-5b40147a-040b-4e8f-83ae-ce187d40ec0d.png)\n\nThe most reliable means of identifying, pushing, and retrieving a draft from a WebDAV site (that I found, anyway,) is by using its [Universally unique identifier](https:\/\/en.m.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Universally_unique_identifier) (UUID) in its pathname. An apt example: [the draft I’m currently whittling on](https:\/\/davidblue.wtf\/drafts\/7247282E-340B-4890-A2F7-0481AF31321E.html), enumerated `7247282E-340B-4890-A2F7-0481AF31321E`. The action above - [Draft to \/drafts as UUID.html](https:\/\/actions.getdrafts.com\/a\/1ve) - will push the contents of your current draft to \/drafts\/`the Draft’s UUID`.html. (That's how I created the example.) \n\n![NeoCitiesActionGroup-Viewedonmacos](https:\/\/user-images.githubusercontent.com\/43663476\/153760436-80095f77-6d9a-4325-8b09-e871bb812bb2.png)\n\nI've done my best to color code the actions based on the potential \"severity\" of their result, but the way they display will depend almost entirely on which particular [Drafts theme](https:\/\/actions.getdrafts.com\/theme_definitions?order=updated) you're using at the moment. Nevertheless, blue\/green indicate the \"safest\" actions - like the ones that simply [open a link to a draft you've already pushed](https:\/\/actions.getdrafts.com\/a\/1vc) - and yellow\/orange\/red actions involve [pushing\/manipulating files at the root of your site](https:\/\/actions.getdrafts.com\/a\/1v9).\n\nBelow is the full documentation of each of the actions (and the separators, even,) including individual install links, though I would very much recommend you install [the whole bit](https:\/\/actions.getdrafts.com\/g\/1uF). You'll need to edit each action and replace `davidblue.wtf` with your own URL(s) unless you'd like to try and attempt my absolutely gargantuan NeoCities password.\n\n## NeoCities Action Group\n\n###

My new Twitter Jail Siri Shortcut marks a milestone in Social Foolery.\n\n<!--more-->\n\nI graduated high school in 2012. Back then, TweetDeck was still a standalone desktop client[^1] that allowed one to post with just the `ENTER` or `return` key. I'd made it part of the [Drywall Prime Directive](https:\/\/iowa.neocities.org) to generally keep [@ihadtopee](https:\/\/twitter.com\/ihadtopee) in [Twitter Jail](https:\/\/www.urbandictionary.com\/define.php?term=TwitterJail) as much as possible, which meant pounding my way into it ASAP, daily. This was often my very first task upon returning home from school. All memories - much less computing memories - are quite obscured from that era, but I wouldn't be surprised if I was spending a cumulative 45 minutes every school day punishing the fuck out of my first flat generation w\/keypad Apple Keyboard to TweetDeck in Windows 7.\n\nhttps:\/\/twitter.com\/TWlTTER_JAIL\/status\/746295481123274752\n\nIt's not that automating Tweets wasn't possible in that era - I'd been posting WHEN IM COMIN DINE IN MY FOREIGN AND IM ROLLIN ONE DEEP THAT SHOULD TELL YA BOUT ME across all my social accounts every morning at 0610 since Freshman year via IFTT (now IFTTT) - but doing so at any sustained rate required actual *knowledge*. \n\nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=4qyHYslaQx4\n\nToday, even an rube like myself can whip up [**a Siri Shortcut**](https:\/\/routinehub.co\/shortcut\/11086\/) capable of jailing a user account in *less than four minutes* from nill - what appears to be a statically-set rate limit of 310 Tweets in that time. Mind you, we're talking about entirely *on-device* processing here, and - in case you weren't aware - the device I'm referring to is my fucking cellular phone.\n\n![TwitterJailTimeline](https:\/\/user-images.githubusercontent.com\/43663476\/153808840-473464ae-2922-45a9-a27b-46d0b7f3a247.png)\n\n[**Twitter Jail**](https:\/\/routinehub.co\/shortcut\/11086\/) technically requires three apps - two of which are ridiculously small, 100% Apple cross-platform, and entirely free - and the third represents simply [the most refined and delightful means](https:\/\/bilge.world\/tweetbot-6-ios-review) anyone has ever interacted with The Bird Site.\n\n### Requirements\n\n- [**Actions**](https:\/\/apps.apple.com\/us\/app\/actions\/id1586435171) - Free across all platforms and just 3.3mb to download!\n- [Tweetbot](https:\/\/apps.apple.com\/us\/app\/tweetbot-6-for-twitter\/id1527500834) (You might also try [Aviary](https:\/\/apps.apple.com\/us\/app\/aviary-for-twitter\/id1522043420) if you absolutely cannot bring yourself to pay a subscription fee, ever.) \n- [Data Jar](https:\/\/apps.apple.com\/us\/app\/data-jar\/id1453273600) (More or less optional.)\n\nUpon installation, you'll be asked 1.) to set the default number of repeats (Tweets) per run. Obviously, I'd recommend ~310 to optimize your jailing. 2.) To specify which Tweetbot-authenticated user account you'd like to get jailed, and 3.) which \"key path\" (jar) you'd like to store the URLs of said Tweets in. The third is almost certainly useless and entirely optional (just delete the Data Jar action,) but... you never know when... you might need... those URLs.\n\nDepending on your device (to some extent, I'd imagine,) proceeding to run the shortcut shouldn't take long. It randomly generates 91 characters text from a string (which you should also feel empowered to customize\/add to,) Tweets them from your specified account, and stores the URLs of those Tweets in the jar you may or may not have specified.\n\nYou might expect me to express envy of any youths reading, but I absolutely feel none. All I can do is encourage you to [fucking try Mastodon](https:\/\/mastodon.social\/invite\/hca7L5sY) for God's sake and your own.\n\n![Twitter Jail macOS](https:\/\/user-images.githubusercontent.com\/43663476\/154838012-2deb774f-6f02-4627-b8dd-f16286968621.png)\n\n## Update: macOS Version Published\n\nI’ve created [**a macOS version of Twitter Jail**](https:\/\/routinehub.co\/shortcut\/11135) which also requires [the Actions app](https:\/\/apps.apple.com\/us\/app\/actions\/id1586435171) but substitutes [Aviary](https:\/\/apps.apple.com\/us\/app\/aviary-for-twitter\/id1522043420) for Tweetbot given the former’s native Siri Shortcuts action does not require the app to open for each Tweet. \n\n[1] It's actually still available from [various sources](https:\/\/downloads.digitaltrends.com\/tweetdeck\/windows) - [including the Mac App Store](https:\/\/apps.apple.com\/us\/app\/tweetdeck-by-twitter\/id485812721) - but has fallen way, way out of support.\n\n#automation #software

Back in my day, we were taught not to touch the screen. *It’s not good for it*, they’d say. Now, that’s all we do, and it makes me profoundly uncomfortable. I have used a fleet of microfiber cloths (ashamedly sourced from Amazon until recently) to rigorously scrub away the CRUD that results from my disgusting, gorgeous hands touching anything for any duration. I also use Vinegar-based Windex (which is just vinegar,) which has definitely eroded my 12 Pro Max’s [Oleophobic coating](https:\/\/discussions.apple.com\/thread\/251502745) away entirely. It smells wonderful, though.\n\nWhat’s brought me great grief since the Apple Rag’s debut, notably, have been the discussions I’ve heard on Apple-adjacent podcasts like [*Connected*](https:\/\/www.relay.fm\/connected)[^1] post-release of the Rag, detailing just how *sparsely* Touchscreen Pros like Federico Viticci actually clean their Pro Screens. Less than once per week, if I recall correctly. I asked this question [in the *MacStories* Discord](https:\/\/discord.com\/channels\/836622115435184162\/836622115880828961\/947175164800565248) to only a single response:\n\n> Never, really. Sometimes with the side of my hand, but that's only when I really notice the screen being dirty.\n\nI’m assuming silence from the rest of the crowed indicates embarrassment. I clean my 12 Pro Max’s screen once every two hours, bare minimum.\n\n![Rag on Couch](https:\/\/user-images.githubusercontent.com\/43663476\/155851075-a933d702-8fd0-480d-aaae-a4322d2e46a6.jpeg)\n\n## Methodology\n\nI must admit - it took me a bit to understand the correct methodology for the Apple Rag. At first, I was trying to use the Rag like I’ve used other microfiber cloths, but it’s uniquely suited to flat rubbing upon mostly already cleaned glass screens, which makes sense, I suppose. Unlike regular microfiber cloths, its surface does not lend well to liquid cleaning solutions or scrubbing non-glass surfaces. Nor does it to cleaning *truly* grubby surfaces. As far as I know, it’s not washable - I probably shouldn’t have thrown the packaging away, but I didn’t expect to review it.\n\nhttps:\/\/twitter.com\/NeoYokel\/status\/1497636091905683456\n\nI would advise a strong, rotational approach under moderate pressure when using the Rag on your device’s screen. I would not advise you use it on your face or hands. I also would not advise you use it to clean your dog’s paws after a muddy bout. More reasonably, it’s not even all that great for cleaning glasses lenses. (It might just be that mine are particularly dirty.)\n\nhttps:\/\/youtube.com\/watch?v=PHWKa9P9-7k\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIt sounds a bit silly, but $20 is actually a ridiculous amount of money to spend on a single microfiber cloth. I’d link you alternatives, but I’m committed to never sharing Amazon links on this here blog. For what it’s worth, the Apple Rag appears to have a strong resistance to liquids (they just fall off,) and a truly unique competency at cleaning glass screens.\n\n<!--comment-->\n\n#hardware\n\n---\n\n[1] No, I don’t remember the specific episode I’m talking about, sorry.","views":1138,"updated":"2022-07-09T05:01:02Z","tags":["hardware"],"type":null,"title":"Apple Rag Review","slug":"apple-polishing-cloth","appearance":"norm","language":"en","rtl":false,"created":"2022-02-28T01:22:22Z","images":["https:\/\/user-images.githubusercontent.com\/43663476\/155785511-14f16190-1a42-4afc-b69c-6b1377dba6ae.jpeg","https:\/\/user-images.githubusercontent.com\/43663476\/155851075-a933d702-8fd0-480d-aaae-a4322d2e46a6.jpeg"],"collection":{"public":false,"alias":"bilge","total_posts":0,"title":"The Psalms","verification_link":"","description":"A <a href=\"https:\/\/davidblue.wtf\/db.vcf\">narcoleptic yokel<\/a> on software and culture.","style_sheet":"","views":177027,"monetization_pointer":""},"paid":false},{"id":"uwbe6tnlfg2t9f41","body":"![Shortcuts Run Links](https:\/\/user-images.githubusercontent.com\/43663476\/155768732-03ca73a9-9b18-414f-ae86-a27bbe01ce04.png)\n\n## Imagine running shortcuts from anywhere you can place a link.\n\n<!--more-->\n\nThere seemed to be a bit of confusion regarding a shortcut I posted on RoutineHub a few days ago entitled “[**Generate Shortcuts Run Links List**](https:\/\/routinehub.co\/shortcut\/11143),” so I thought I’d attempt to overview how I’ve come to use Shortcuts’ URL scheme as my primary method of calling shortcuts across both iOS and macOS.\n\nThe basis of the whole shit is `shortcuts:\/\/run-shortcut?name=` and `shortcuts:\/\/x-callback-url\/run-shortcut?name=`. Using these along with URL-encoded shortcuts titles (for those containing a space,) we can create links that will run shortcuts from anywhere on iOS or macOS as hyperlinks. These days, this is how I run most of my even semi-regular-use shortcuts, largely from my first Dot in Iconfactory’s [Tot](https:\/\/apps.apple.com\/us\/app\/tot-pocket\/id1498235191).\n\n![Tot](https:\/\/user-images.githubusercontent.com\/43663476\/155801898-e6c74cee-c26a-458c-a915-c3f969c6f3fd.png)\n\nWith a few exceptions, all the links you see in the above screenshot above “Drafts Instrument Panel” are shortcuts run links of the same type. Most of these, I typed out by hand with [a TextExpander snippet](https:\/\/app.textexpander.com\/public\/14093096578d4f40eeea15649f5cefbb). Here’s what the mess looks like underneath:\n\n![Tot Code](https:\/\/user-images.githubusercontent.com\/43663476\/155803031-436d36a3-c0be-4da1-9df4-72a9d6e8e350.png)\n\nI had a bit of an issue creating the shortcut, itself. Though Shortcuts includes a native [URL Encode action](https:\/\/www.matthewcassinelli.com\/actions\/url-encode\/), I couldn’t seem to get it to reliably generate URL-encoded shortcuts names, which is why I inserted the [Text Case](https:\/\/apps.apple.com\/us\/app\/text-case\/id1492174677) action, instead.\n\n<!--comment-->\n\n#automation #software #configuration","views":1956,"updated":"2022-07-01T19:41:32Z","tags":["configuration","automation","software"],"type":null,"title":"Run Siri Shortcuts with Hyperlinks","slug":"run-siri-shortcuts-with-hyperlinks","appearance":"norm","language":"en","rtl":false,"created":"2022-03-04T17:10:47Z","images":["https:\/\/user-images.githubusercontent.com\/43663476\/155803031-436d36a3-c0be-4da1-9df4-72a9d6e8e350.png","https:\/\/user-images.githubusercontent.com\/43663476\/155768732-03ca73a9-9b18-414f-ae86-a27bbe01ce04.png","https:\/\/user-images.githubusercontent.com\/43663476\/155801898-e6c74cee-c26a-458c-a915-c3f969c6f3fd.png"],"collection":{"public":false,"alias":"bilge","total_posts":0,"title":"The Psalms","verification_link":"","description":"A <a href=\"https:\/\/davidblue.wtf\/db.vcf\">narcoleptic yokel<\/a> on software and culture.","style_sheet":"","views":177027,"monetization_pointer":""},"paid":false},{"id":"c005obazp5d9zf2f","body":"![Blink Folder](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/4ik6Tmwv.png)\n\n## The ideal means of *On The Go* participation in The Tildeverse.\n\n<!--more-->\n\n<audio controls>\n  <source src=\"https:\/\/davidblue.wtf\/audio\/blink.m4a\">\n<\/audio>\n\nI was completely unaware of the Tildeverse’s origin story - documented in [a Medium post](https:\/\/medium.com\/message\/tilde-club-i-had-a-couple-drinks-and-woke-up-with-1-000-nerds-a8904f0a2ebf) by *WIRED* Editor-in-Chief, Paul Ford - until this year, somehow, though I knew of its existence as far back as 2018. I was living in an unairconditioned Portland apartment, then, and had found myself *stuck* with Linux for the first time in my adult life. Consequentially, this period of my life became my first true introduction to the Command Line - a space about which I knew no more than the layest layman. Hopping between my ten-year-old, post-corporate system’s shell and the DOS machines I was emulating on it (exploring the history of word processors, mostly,) I believe I struggled through dare I say a Rite of Computing Passage, obtaining the capability (and eventually, the muscle memory) to navigate a filesystem with `cd`, `ls`, and (on DOS) `dir`. It wasn’t until I came home in ‘19 that I discovered the two primary emulated Linux shells *on iOS*: [**iSH Shell**](https:\/\/apps.apple.com\/us\/app\/ish-shell\/id1436902243) and [**a-Shell**](https:\/\/apps.apple.com\/us\/app\/a-shell\/id1473805438).\n\n![iSH Shell and a-Shell](https:\/\/user-images.githubusercontent.com\/43663476\/157366845-a604bd4c-3ea8-46fe-85e6-930adb8ca180.png)\n\nThe former is designed to emulate [Alpine Linux](https:\/\/alpinelinux.org) and has just recently added direct filesystem access via the Files app. The latter is, I’m told, quite extensible, and includes Siri Shortcuts actions that have enabled it to underpin powerful scraping shortcuts like [SW-DLT](https:\/\/routinehub.co\/shortcut\/7284\/) - a sort of frontend for youtube-dl and now yt-dlp. Both are open source, but a-Shell is actually [a fork](https:\/\/github.com\/holzschu\/a-shell) of our subject app, now called “[**Blink Shell & Code**](https:\/\/apps.apple.com\/us\/app\/blink-shell-code\/id1594898306)” in the App Store.[^1]\n\n![bbj Out](https:\/\/user-images.githubusercontent.com\/43663476\/155115271-faa55bfd-d151-4741-9a6c-e9664a457503.png)\n\nBlink’s tag is “a professional, desktop grade terminal for iOS.” Its [landing page](https:\/\/blink.sh) touts a “first class iOS experience, with software and hardware keyboard, and the full edge-to-edge experience” experience. On *iPad*, Blink’s heyday was well documented by the likes of [Paul Miller’s 2018 article for *The Verge*](https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/circuitbreaker\/2018\/3\/27\/17152482\/ipad-pro-web-development-setup-how-to-terminal-apps) and Fatih Arslan’s 2019 “[Using the iPad Pro as my development machine](https:\/\/arslan.io\/2019\/01\/07\/using-the-ipad-pro-as-my-development-machine\/).” These pieces more or less detail different use cases of the exact sort Blink was designed for - “professional” work done using an iPad as the terminal for a remote Linux\/macOS machine.\n\n![Apreche Reply](https:\/\/user-images.githubusercontent.com\/43663476\/157371504-32ebbca7-81bf-43c0-a762-cdbc0ad50181.png)\n\nSince I’ve [apparently](https:\/\/twitter.com\/NeoYokel\/status\/1421410673049972739) ended up with a primary life mission of *doing stuff on my iPhone originally meant to be done on iPads*, I’ve managed to find myself [an active member](https:\/\/tilde.town\/~extratone) of the Tilde.Town community - a place exclusively accessible via SSH, aside from [public pages](https:\/\/raindrop.io\/davidblue\/tilde-22520136) - exclusively through [my iPhone 12 Pro Max](https:\/\/github.com\/extratone\/jorts). I’m not the first to use Blink to do this - note [Apreche](https:\/\/tilde.town\/~apreche)’s reply to my thread, embedded above - but I suspect I’m the first to spend significant Town Time on my *fucking phone*, so I thought it might be worth laying out some of the particulars I’ve learned along the way. \n\n*It’s important to note that 99% of the use detailed in this guide\/account involves the use of a paired Bluetooth keyboard.*\n\n![Blink Settings](https:\/\/user-images.githubusercontent.com\/43663476\/157378620-9fb29373-d49e-4519-b734-8c75caf54dad.png)\n\n## Locally\n\nFirst, Blink’s settings menu is accessed by typing `config` and\/or `⌘,`. Unfortunately, there’s no method of installing the entire selection of available [fonts](https:\/\/github.com\/blinksh\/fonts) or [themes](https:\/\/github.com\/blinksh\/themes) - you’ll have to do so one at a time, though you can optimize the process by learning\/copy-and-pasting the url scheme for the fonts\/themes directories on their respective repos. I especially recommend [CLRS](https:\/\/github.com\/blinksh\/themes\/blob\/master\/themes\/CLRS.js), [Man Page](https:\/\/github.com\/blinksh\/themes\/blob\/master\/themes\/Man%20Page.js), and [MonaLisa](https:\/\/github.com\/blinksh\/themes\/blob\/master\/themes\/MonaLisa.js), but this Post is saturated with *too* many mocked up screenshots of Blink themes to reasonably continue that list any further.\n\n![Local UNIX Commands in Blink-ManPage](https:\/\/user-images.githubusercontent.com\/43663476\/155014762-7b8bfc6d-d6df-418a-b43e-6d7aa56582bb.png)\n\nCompared with its fork, a-Shell, Blink’s local UNIX command list is a bit sparse. It’s accessed exclusively with `TAB`. Where a-Shell has `pickFolder`, Blink has `link-files`, which does effectively the same thing: the Files app is opened, prompting you to select a folder, which will become visible and accessible in the command line.\n\n![Repository Cleaning](https:\/\/user-images.githubusercontent.com\/43663476\/156869875-93a67975-beb2-4a25-a855-b845514ed8b3.png)\n\nLinking [*The Psalms*’ GitHub Repository](https:\/\/github.com\/extratone\/bilge) in [Working Copy](https:\/\/apps.apple.com\/us\/app\/working-copy-git-client\/id896694807) with `link-files` in Blink had profound results. I was offered a brief glance of that enhanced productivity command line evangelists always seem to be on about, if only because the files and directories were color-coded by type so distinctly. `open` also somehow lead to swifter previews than in Working Copy, despite that app’s brilliance.\n\n![BaityYouTubeThumbnail](https:\/\/user-images.githubusercontent.com\/43663476\/155200832-d2d5fdcb-9538-4f3e-be46-e3b203f28f17.png)\n\nSome other particularly intriguing standouts include `say`, which unfortunately does *not* use your preferred Siri voice to speak aloud text, but rather the oldest there is. `facecam` will open a manipulatable circle of your device’s front-facing camera view, as shown in the screenshot embedded above. `openurl` will instantly open a formally-formatted web URL in Safari, which can come in handy. `pbcopy` and `pbpaste` really do manipulate the iOS system clipboard, which I probably find more impressive than I should. `code` is the newest to the bunch and will open a local instance of GitHub Codespaces(?) If this is truly useful on iPad - which plenty of positive feedback on social suggests it is, to at least a few human beings - it is barely usable on iPhone, which is to be expected, really.\n\n![Blink and Code](https:\/\/user-images.githubusercontent.com\/43663476\/157388631-7668b9d9-22e7-4fef-8c36-1081e213c193.png)\n\nBlink’s own “[UNIX Command Line Tools Roundup](https:\/\/docs.blink.sh\/advanced\/unix-roundup)” does an okay job of outlining the rest of the basic networking and file management commands included that act locally, though I’ve still been unable to find out what `skstore` does. `xcall` opens x-callback-URLs, though I’m [still trying to figure out](https:\/\/reddit.com\/r\/BlinkShell\/comments\/ta27h9\/docs_for_xcall_command) what the command’s options are. `ed` the ancient command line text editor is available, though I’ve yet to learn to use it, and `uptime` appears to be actually accurate? Being able to run `whois` locally on iPhone has its uses, especially given the aforementioned support of `pbcopy`. `whois bilge.world | pbcopy` copies *The Psalms* domain registry information to the iOS clipboard in a flash.\n\n![Blink Keyboard Shortcuts](https:\/\/user-images.githubusercontent.com\/43663476\/158213859-c477ddb3-dc51-47b2-8e2f-fa0df9b339ad.png)\n\n### Keyboarding\n\nTo its credit, I think [Blink’s landing page](https:\/\/blink.sh) represents the most explicitly pro-keyboard literature I’ve ever seen for an iOS app. From my fairly extensive use, its Bluetooth keyboard support fully reflects these declarations, even on iPhone. Out of the list of shortcuts you see in the screenshot embedded above, `Share Selection` is by far the one I use most, usually to open a link from the Tilde IRC chat. If I’m lucky\/accurate, double tapping said link will select all of it and *only* it. \n\nAfter a link is selected - which sometimes involves rotating the phone and\/or zooming far out to get longer URLS in a single line - I’m able to call it up in the iOS sharesheet with `⌥U`, then open it in Safari with a Siri Shortcut I’ve placed there entitled “[O P E N](https:\/\/www.icloud.com\/shortcuts\/52e6c820f965488b91ca4b76c99434af).” Or - in the case of a direct link to a file - I could use another shortcut of mine just below it, called “[DOWNLOAD](https:\/\/www.icloud.com\/shortcuts\/af5a886c9b044bf194dd52127a3939c3),” which uses the [Get Contents of URL](https:\/\/www.matthewcassinelli.com\/actions\/get-contents-of-url\/) action to download files directly to my Downloads folder in iCloud Drive. Googling a selection (⌥G) has come in handy once or twice. I tried the Stack Overflow shortcut for kicks, but was meant with an endless string of CAPTCHA requests.\n\n![Blink Custom Key Presses](https:\/\/user-images.githubusercontent.com\/43663476\/158233450-e7a2eec8-1eae-478d-ab7e-35a2dec79e25.png)\n\nAn extraordinary feature of Blink’s which I originally misunderstood and have just begun to play with: **custom key presses**. In `Config ⇨ Keyboard ⇨ Custom Presses`, one can assign any text that can be hex encoded (Base16) to a keyboard shortcut. I’ve created a Siri Shortcut that requires the free version of [GizmoPack](https:\/\/apps.apple.com\/us\/app\/gizmopack\/id1505218567) to aid myself (and you, hopefully,) in quickly converting plain text commands to this format. In the screenshots embedded above, the shortcuts listed on the left correspond in order with the commands listed on the right. You’ll note I’ve begun to attempt assigning quick keys to my most commonly typed-out commands.\n\n![Importing Keys in Blink Shell](https:\/\/user-images.githubusercontent.com\/43663476\/154846142-4d16aa31-ee99-4ce9-94c5-852765d7d0b7.png)\n\n## Remotes with SSH and Mosh\n\nIf you’re entirely new to SSH as a concept, I’ve found no better introduction than [Tilde.Town’s own SSH Primer](https:\/\/tilde.town\/~extratone\/wiki\/getting-started\/ssh.html). I screwed up my first attempt at obtaining a key, but Town Maintainer [vilmibm](https:\/\/tilde.town\/~vilmibm) kindly responded to my Twitter DM in December of last year asking to instate a new key. I can’t remember whether or not I generated it originally within Blink, but regardless, the app’s key management is as intuitive as I’ve seen. \n\n![Blink Autocomplete](https:\/\/user-images.githubusercontent.com\/43663476\/157376845-c2adf11e-7f8c-44d1-8a37-fec0a9fabbcc.png)\n\nOne of my unexpected favorite bits about Blink is its autocomplete feature which applies to both “commands and hosts” as quoted from [its singular mention in the docs](https:\/\/docs.blink.sh\/whats-new#version-100). There very well could be a better means of typing out absurdly long filenames in other terminal emulators, but I’ve personally not come across anything remotely like this magic of Blink’s. Especially for someone newish to the command line like myself, its autocomplete occasionally borders on “intelligent auto*suggestion*” without actually crossing the threshold in an irritating way. Once I configured Tilde.Town as a host (with the local name Tilde.Town,) all I need do to connect is begin to type `ssh T` or `mosh T` (ssh keys == mosh keys, which I wish I knew weeks ago) and `TAB` to complete the full `ssh Tilde.Town` or `mosh Tilde.Town` commands.\n\n![Adding Files App Locations in Blink](https:\/\/user-images.githubusercontent.com\/43663476\/154846342-b9d49f30-61c4-438d-8886-0414951807f6.png)\n\nOnce you’ve connected to Town, you should take advantage of [Blink’s Files app integration](https:\/\/docs.blink.sh\/advanced\/files-app) by adding a location at the bottom of its entry in the Hosts menu. This adds Blink to the master, root list of file providers in the app. From there, all of the Files app’s features (including drag-and-drop) will apply to Tilde.Town as long as you’re sustaining at least one connection via ssh or mosh.\n\n![Blink File Providers](https:\/\/user-images.githubusercontent.com\/43663476\/154846662-df10d713-6f54-46d2-8fb9-d1f77d42b14e.png)\n\nTo illustrate, here’s a wee, one-take tutorial on uploading images this way:\n\n### Mini Tutorial: [Uploading images to the Tildeverse with Blink Shell](https:\/\/user-images.githubusercontent.com\/43663476\/193413576-d210a0e1-7f93-4425-a217-362c2fb6650a.MOV)\n\n<video controls width=\"360\" height=auto>\n  <source src=\"https:\/\/user-images.githubusercontent.com\/43663476\/193413576-d210a0e1-7f93-4425-a217-362c2fb6650a.MOV\">\n<\/video>\n\n![Novel Chat Fixed](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/mz8lgDFt.png)\n\n## Chat\n\nThe IRC client TildeTown uses is called [WeeChat](https:\/\/weechat.org) and - especially if it’s been as long for you as it had been for me - you might find (as I did) learning the ropes to be a bit dubitable. I’ve [duplicated the full User Guide](https:\/\/tilde.town\/~extratone\/manual\/weechat\/) for your consideration. I got stuck at the concept of switching buffers, so my Big Pro hint is to start off running `\/buffer 1` followed by `help`. In order to display the chat even remotely readably in portrait mode on an iPhone, you’ll need to remove the buffer list by hiding it. (Try `\/help bar` in the first buffer.) You’ll also need to zoom out a bit and set the display mode to `Fill` via the menus that appear with a *three-finger* tap anywhere on screen. To achieve the look shown in the screenshot embedded above, you’ll need to hide a few things, but I’ll come back to those specific commands in a sec.\n\nAssuming you intend to stay connected to Town IRC *On The Go*, I’d advise always starting your intended chat window with mosh, which - through [a whole bunch of alchemy](https:\/\/docs.blink.sh\/advanced\/advanced-mosh) I’m incapable of understanding - establishes a much more flexible sort of connection that’s actually realistically dependable from within the uncertain world of a backgrounded iPhone app. Optionally, [the `geo` command](https:\/\/docs.blink.sh\/advanced\/advanced-ssh#persistent-ssh-connections-with-blink) can be used to force iOS into allowing Blink a more genuine background running state with `geo track`. Additionally, `geo current` displays a nicely-formatted set of location information:[^2]\n\n```json\n{\n  “Latitude” : 38.933988900043886,\n  “AltitudeRef” : 0,\n  “GPSVersion” : “2.3.0.0”,\n  “DateStamp” : “2022:03:09”,\n  “Altitude” : 203.0797061920166,\n  “Longitude” : 92.388242309618036,\n  “LongitudeRef” : “W”,\n  “TimeStamp” : “14:35:13.140000”,\n  “LatitudeRef” : “N”,\n  “DOP” : 35\n}\n```\n\nAs you’d expect, the persistence allowed by this feature - which does, indeed, extend to remote files access in the Files app as you move about the world - comes at a significant consumptive power and resource sacrifice. If you parse the slapdash language in the docs, the implication is that you should only need to use the `geo` command to make *ssh* connections persistent, not mosh connections. Since encountering this wording, I’ve yet to have an opportunity to explore the real world truth of this supposition because I have only my rotting legs to propel me around, these days.\n\nIf I remember correctly, I once found a surprisingly capable (for the time and circumstances) iPhone IRC app in [Colloquy’s iPhone OS offering](https:\/\/apps.apple.com\/us\/app\/colloquy-irc-client\/id302000478), though it appears to have fallen far, far out of support, now. LimeChat’s iPhone app isn’t listed on the App Store anymore and [its landing page](http:\/\/limechat.net\/iphone\/) proudly touts support for *iOS 4 multitasking*!\n\n> Connections are kept in 10 minutes after going to background.\n\nMy memories of computer use from that time are ever so vague, but after just a brief junket to the era’s surviving app literature, some abyssal images within me were stirred. I suspect I tried every possible solution as I’ve always tended to, even back then, on my first generation iPhone and then my 4S. I remember Colloquy being the most tenable, but far from persistent, of course. As I recall, one could maintain a conversation as a passenger on a car trip, for instance, but remaining ambiently, eternally *Logged In* - as is the ancient custom of Internet Relay Chat - was too far out of reach to even be of consideration. \n\nTo be honest, I still find the whole idea unnatural, and I’m not alone, but I can promise you that **running Blink on a recent iPhone with the average American cellular connection is as close to the full WeeChat experience as is possible on a handset, today**, for whatever that may be worth to you. Thanks to some incredibly helpful new TildeTown friends, its copious configurability pivoted from an insurmountable, puzzling ordeal to a never before conceived of solution. If you haven’t already, skim the actual conversation contained within the pre-header screenshot, above.\n\n#### WeeChat Configuration\n\nThe following is the precise set of commands involved in making WeeChat look as the screenshot does, though in no particular order. As [m455](https:\/\/tilde.town\/~m455) pointed out, `fset` is the tool that lists available configurable options and their current status in a linear way. The default of the second option in the list is apparently `11`, but I fiddled quite a bit to find `9` more optimum.\n\n- `fset`\n- `\/set weechat.look.prefix_align_max 9`\n- `\/bar hide bufflist`\n- `\/bar hide fset`\n- `\/bar hide title`\n- `\/bar hide nicklist`\n- `\/set weechat.look.buffer_time_format \"%M\"`\n\nIf you eliminate the value of the very last command (so just “”) and add `\/bar hide status` to the list, you’ll end up with a more minimal-looking, timestamp-less experience:\n\n![Spacedust Chat-Minimal](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/FhjqlFV1.png)\n\nIf indeed there is a “reasonable” configuration for command line IRC display on a telephone in the year 2022, surely, this is it.\n\n![Town TV](https:\/\/user-images.githubusercontent.com\/43663476\/157794243-413146bf-d004-4502-8ecd-b9bde2c10437.jpeg)\n\n## Town Television\n\nDue largely to its primary market of iPad-bound developers living and working in remote Digital Ocean droplets, significant effort (I assume) has been expended in making Blink Shell one of the few iOS apps which *usably* supports external AirPlay displays, even, yes, on iPhone. As far as I can tell, all of the iPad options in the appearance settings menu seen below have also functioned in my tests on iPhone, casting an entirely separate set of Blink windows to my mom’s [Huge Ass Samsung television](https:\/\/www.samsung.com\/us\/support\/televisions-home-theater\/televisions\/qled-4k-tvs\/t-model-line-up-2020) in ten-eighty pee.[^3]\n\n![Blink Appearance Settings](https:\/\/user-images.githubusercontent.com\/43663476\/157918199-c9007d31-cb39-4e18-9e2d-e10ac3c93974.png)\n\nIf you’ve somehow found yourself this far, you’re probably looking for the keyboard shortcut`⌘O`, which **switches your currently active cursor between the device and the external display**. “You can also move windows between iPad and External Display with `⇧⌘O`,” say [the docs](https:\/\/docs.blink.sh\/basics\/tips-and-tricks#display-what-is-blink-window). Other considerations I’ve discovered through experiments with this: You can lock the phone with the external display running, but it won’t update, even with mosh or with`geo track.` AirPlay will also cease after a period I couldn’t be bothered to determine, so if anything, this is more of an inconvenience than a feature.\n\n![Notifications in Blink](https:\/\/user-images.githubusercontent.com\/43663476\/158088240-a0f27c3c-1782-4323-bfc5-2c280d3c98e9.png)\n\n## Other Considerations\n\nBlink has a URL scheme - `blinkshell:\/\/run?key=[YourKey]&cmd=` - but it’s not particularly useful, largely because it’s for the moment left [without any real documentation](https:\/\/reddit.com\/r\/BlinkShell\/comments\/swzphf\/url_scheme_documentation\/). I was able to create a Drafts action that runs one’s current selection as a command in Blink, but the app doesn’t appear to like it very much, if you know what I mean. Blink also integrates with iOS system notifications - as exemplified in the screenshot embedded above - and they *do* work consistently with mentions in town chat, even outside the app, though I’ve yet to see one including any useful information. You’ll know that *something* happened, maybe. Recently, the app has taken to displaying a nondescript notification every time I re-open WeeChat, even without new messages since the last time I opened it.\n\nSomehow, upon logging into macOS for the first time since installing all the aforementioned themes in Blink, I found the same themes available in the Mac Terminal. I’m sure there’s an explanation involving hidden iCloud Drive folders - and I can’t imagine being anything but pleasantly surprised to find oneself flush with more Terminal themes - but it’s still worth a heads up.\n\nPhilosophically, one might declare the practice I’ve outlined here to be definitively against everything the Tildeverse is about - the small web, Linuxy stuff. Bringing this up in TildeChat a few times, I was met only with acceptance. In fact, acceptance, curiosity, and support is *all* I’ve been met with throughout my first few months as a townie, and I hope this Post encourages\/aids more folks to come join me in this shared computer. You can find the sign-up form for TildeTown [here](https:\/\/cgi.tilde.town\/users\/signup) and the corresponding GitHub Issue for this post (with a bunch more screenshots) [here](https:\/\/github.com\/extratone\/bilge\/issues\/307).\n\n#software #configuration\n\n---\n\n[1] [Blink’s icon](https:\/\/tilde.town\/~extratone\/icons\/blink.png) is perhaps my most favorite of any application, ever.\n[2] Yes, that is my real location information and yes, I did include it intentionally.

In the right hour, the fickle wind and the social owls were the only sound, and nothing moved but the sparse, light-footed doe in careful segments with her fawn. From the main gated lane of *The Nice, Huge Estate*, Lenny Lather slid through the muddy barrier and started bouncing West on the blacktop, brogues squeaking every third step. The overcasted clouds were having trouble deciding whether or not to let down their rain – as they had been all day – and the old, heavy early-March mist softened the yellow glow of the tall, buzzing streetlamps so much that he couldn’t help but intermittently wipe his eyes, for the spreading light convinced his mind that his eyelashes must’ve been wetted.\n\nTheodore Pith’s big old house was now burrowed between two mismatched neighborhoods – the bleaker Easterly, which was too new for its alien trees to have recovered from the brutality of its development’s clear-cutting and contained within one of its central featureless backyards an unidentifiable creature which made all through the night the most unimaginably ghastly, disturbingly human child-like shrieking; the opposing Westerly’s trees further enough along in their regrowth – ten or twenty years perhaps – to appear more of the planet Earth to Manhattan-bred Lenny Lather, who still found the colorless destruction of suburbia unendingly upsetting, especially when coming down. In the interest of his regular withdrawal’s mitigation, he had already established two short, repeatable tracks and a longer, several mile-long loop which skirted him sufficiently around the East’s center to avoid hearing the shrieks in all but the stillest nights. Never in his years – on these walks he was *especially* reminded of just how many there were – had he been able to feel such absolute ownership of his surroundings. The eroding Earth slipping away from the hem of the warped, stained wood fences; the sidewalks, cracked, bent, sloped helter-skelter, often muddied in the troughs and joints – generally laying haphazardly in layers after having been steadily tossed about by the glacial forces of their intermixture with clay, precipitation, and the tumultuous temperature-dependent torture of the two – these were his, entirely, in the right hour. Between two and five in the morning when the earliest risers would blearily revive their dewy automobiles from long, silent hibernation, the whole world – everything in his sight and more at any moment – it was all *his*, without a single worthy challenger.\n\nIn the right hour, the roads were completely and totally abandoned – for the New Yorker, an unfathomable absolute – and all humanity was at rest. In the right hour, Lenny Lather was the appointed guardian of the worn domesticity of a small nation, though the lonely occupation was astoundingly lax, for in the miles and miles of empty streets he had already traversed in his nightly holidays from the World of Pith, he had yet to encounter a single unexpected factor or minutely threatening presence. Since shortly after his December arrival, he’d walked through even the most frigid mornings. Of course, the stillness had then been *even more* otherworldly, and Lenny was curious to see how his new most private domain would change with the seasons. Though the auxiliary guest room which he now called home was no smaller or less hospitable than the master bedroom of his late Hudson Yards flat shared with his late Wife, it proved to be a poor respite from Theodore Pith, who treated him – when they were “home” at *Nice, Huge* – as the puppy he never had, and expected his participation to remain entirely vulnerable to his any whim. Granted – in their shared abuse of amphetamines, cocaine, and assorted other stimulants – Lenny Lather was vastly more prepared for the games than any circadian guest could’ve possibly been. At first, the ten-foot door of his dawn-facing room had closed without latching, but with the warmth and moisture brought with the Midwestern Spring, the most secure state in which the engorged wood could be forcibly arranged still left a half-inch crack, and Lather’s last chance of privacy was lost.\n\nThe latest favorite pastime of *Nice, Big*’s Master necessitated a willing, capable driver, and – as keeping a single Butler (much less an entire household staff) was proving extremely difficult for him – Lenny Lather was the sole pick of the draft. In the earliest hours of one Tuesday morning in February, he’d been pleasantly dosing and drooling on his laptop after an evening of obsessive, incoherent notetaking when the huge door had been kicked ajar by a deep black, blindingly shiny oxford with excessively violent force. Attached to the shoe in an equally blinding penguin tuxedo, towering bowler hat, and cartoonish fake mustache was the Great, Blown Pith.\n\n“Hope you’re not busy,” he’d said quite loudly to the lolling Lather, leaning and tilting his head into the lamp light, which had dislodged his monocle and briefly occupied him with untangling its chain.\n\n…\n\n“You’re not *busy*, are ya?!” he’d shouted, tapping the shiny brass lion’s head of his shiny black cane against the vanity… then swatting it with a flicking wrist… then clubbing it with a full, two-handed homerun swing – taking huge, vaguely cat nose-shaped gouges from the surface of the wood. The splintery wood chips had rained down upon the hunched Lenny; he’d stirred with one found its way in his open mouth – he’d chewed it slowly and swallowed it, but he still had not awoken. Nevertheless, Theodore Pith’s coked-up enthusiasm couldn’t possibly have yielded to common decencies like his guest’s nighttime peace.\n\n…\n\n“SHOOT, LENNY,” he’d screamed in his companion’s ear, having traversed the room to his bedside.\n\n“I SURE HOPE YOU’RE NOT BUSY RIGHT NOW!”\n\n…\n\nFinally, he’d resorted to tickling Lenny’s nose with the ornament, which had reeked with the urinal smell of metal polish – the sudden, overwhelming delivery of which to the writer’s olfactory nerves finally causing ample alarm in his nervous system to justify bringing him abruptly back to his life and deluded host.\n\n“I need a favor. The Duesie’s warming up. We’re going for a ride.”\n\nUnable to form a linguistic response, Lenny Lather had obeyed Theo’s frenzied, repeating instructions and stumbled into the matching suit he’d brought over his arm – wondering with marginal, arrested clarity at how well-tailored it was for him. He had not the soundness of perception to protest when Pith had whipped a deep black, blindingly shiny bowtie around his already-congested esophagus, nor when he’d adheased the huge, itchy matching fake moustache to his upper lip and nearly pulled the matching Tower of Bowler all the way down over his ears. He had been unresponsive when he’d been sat on the bench under the agonizing fluorescent lights of the laundry room, affixed with deep black, blindingly shiny matching oxfords, and asked if he smoked and how well he could say *guffaw.*\n\n…\n\n“Just wait… you have no idea… you have no idea how much fun this is going to be.”\n\nLenny Lather had not… *could not* have made a sound through the confusing nonsense of his waking pre-Great Depression dream, but when the old servant’s door had been opened before him and set the heartless, single-digit Winter wind upon his very soul, he had all at once arrived in the world, laughing and whooping together with Theodore Pith.\n\n“Jesus *Christ!*” he’d screamed as they’d hobbled to the stable, where a devilishly dark red Model J Duesenberg had sat shivering in a rough idle, staring out the retrofitted garage door with its basketball-sized lights as if it was, indeed, a flesh-and-blood steed that had just been frightened awake by a thunderstorm, but the sky had been as clear as it would’ve been from an asteroid – as it is only on the coldest nights – and almost comically dominated by the setting, gluttonously luminescent moon. Theodore had then grabbed a screwdriver from the workbench and bent down to remove the license plate – which had said *BLOOD* in big black bold block letters – and its containing frame. By the time he had settled into the frigid red leather of the exposed, roofless driver’s seat, Lenny Lather was full-to-bursting with adrenaline and laughing out huge streams of breathy steam. From behind him in the cabin, Pith had been *guffawing* plumes, too, as he’d briefly ignited his cocaine-sprinkled mustache instead of the bratwurst-sized cigar between his teeth. The smell of burning human hair had accented his explanation of the old car’s transmission and its direct path from source-to-nose for Pith had required a brief, unplanned intermission as it induced without warning his violent heaving – still part-*guffawing* – hanging half out of his beautifully-upholstered suicide door.\n\nAs he had spewed – expertly sparing the swoop of the gleaming waxy fender – Lenny had found a pair of deep black, blindingly shiny gloves and – after less grinding than you would imagine, to his credit – first gear, setting the whole dastardly circus in motion.\n\n“Where to, Sire?” Lenny had asked, nose lifted to an untenable altitude in a pitiful approximation of an accent that’d never actually been used before by any person or persons in all of history, struggling for breath.\n\n“Left at the gates, Barnsward, old chap,” Theodore had replied in a contrasting fashion after again sitting upright from his heaves and taking a breath, ironing out – if anything – the flatness of his perforating Ohio Ds and Ps, resulting in such a culturally destructive racket that it had set both of them in uncontrollable, cloudy fits lasting long after Lather had swerved the great length of the car from the gravel to his abandoned asphalt retreat. The two had continued their banter down that soul-suckingly flat vector, one-upping each other’s etymologic barbarity against the savage thievery of the heatless wind.\n\n“Now to star-board, Budleigh, my good fellow!”\n\n…\n\n“Right-o, as you say, sir!”\n\n…\n\n“Down to the *pu-hb* for a *spaht* of *brahn*-dee with me *mae-its*!”\n\n…\n\n“*Oncemo-ar* right, pip pip!”\n\n…\n\n“By *jah-lee*, there we are!”\n\n…\n\nAfter the entirety of Northern European history had been decimated and subsequently forgotten, the Duesenberg named *BLOOD* had turned its orange, googley-eyed stare and narrow whitewalled hooves up the reflective, freshly-painted access of the new 24-hour grocery in the no-man’s-land between the cookie-cutter stares of the neatly-rowed Easterly neighborhood and the droning respiration of Interstate 43, two miles distant. It was 2:12 in the morning and most of the greasy-haired night stocking shift had been halfway through their third smoke break, circled around a store-used picnic table 50 yards from the far sliding airlock doors. The first to spot *BLOOD* had been the second shortest of the lot, whose weary scrutiny along the truest radian to the West from under his sweaty beanie in her entrance she had crossed, and the depth of her red as he first spied it had caused him vertigo – as if he would fall in – and cast upon the shorter-than-average length of his being an all-consuming existential doubt. The tallest and loudest of them had faced squarest the white faux-brick wall of the box building and was at that moment engaged upon a spirited rant about where and where’nt and when a vapist ought to buy his Suck juice between long, gasping Sucks from his super-shiny Suck box. Of course, the arrival of a customer even at such a late hour did not warrant notice at a huge, broadly-servicing operation like theirs, but as *BLOOD* had crept through all four reflective yellow-checkered pedestrian crossings, closing without a flinch, and the details of her occupying caricatures had become more and more numerous, she had stolen the attention of the huddle, one-by-one, and elicited from each the rarest under-breath profanity of true, unmolested wonder.\n\n“*Jesus Christ*,” had said the shortest.\n\n“*Holy fuck,*” had said the youngest.\n\n“*Gee whiz*,” had said the oldest.\n\nAnd the Sucking tallest, having realized he’d lost his audience, had been the last to turn and follow their eyes *BLOOD*’s way as she had halted coolly in front of the purely white glowing concrete leading into the closest customer entrance, and had – without the gradual exposure over the length of her approach that his peers had been afforded – dropped his Suck box and exclaimed at the sudden, undiluted immensity of the spectacle, simply, “*FUCK!*”\n\nThe Sucking’s *FUCK* and the splitting shatter of his Suck against the glass of their smoking table had reached the two arrivees – albeit in a muted way – and through the onset of their frostbite’s early stages even further stoked their already-uncontrollable boyish giggling. Theodore Pith had paused briefly to affix his monocle as firmly as possible in his eye socket and stuff down his spasmic *guffaws* with a few lip-smacking puffs of his then successfully-lit cigar before swinging his right door open.\n\n“Stay here and wait at the ready, my good… my *best* Bagsy! I shan’t be a twinkle,” he had declared, clicking it lightly shut again and turning on his heels toward the pale light of the store, twirling his cane in dramatically shortened strides so as to reproduce the oversped effect of a silent motion picture, puff-puffing away. As the doors had sensed him and indiscriminately whirred aside, he had turned to the smokers – most of whom had still been reeling, grabbing for their hair – and bobbed the bulk of his big black bowler toward their communion with his gloved black fingers by the brim.\n\n“Tally-*ho*, my boys!” he had shouted, sending Lenny Lather’s wide open face toward the floor of the idling car as he doubled over himself in the first spontaneously asphyxiating, tear-lobbing laughter he’d yet to experience in the 21st century. As Theodore had entered the masterpiece of the boxed store’s bleakness in his cane twirling, head swinging, cigar puffing shuffle, he had made sure to stay his instinct to *sneak* for a swift, full-chat *dart*, instead, and the on-duty leather-faced embodiment of tedium’s wrath beneath his lone lit lane light had looked up from his *People* Magazine just in time to see the heel of a deeply black oxford and the last shiny inches of flowing black coattails disappear behind the potato sack endcap of the far Aisle 1. He’d hesitated, chin against palm, holding his next glossed page perpendicularly erect between his tightened thumb and index finger for a long few seconds of fantastic stillness – had hastily attempted a diagnostic of his present senses – before a locomotive-like segmented tube of cigar smoke had risen from against the light tiles and unsoiled trimming to intersect his line-of-sight where it met the darkened deli, recessed in the far wall from his hunch, the motion startling him into his own throat-clearing, counter-rounding, key-jingling, *excuse me*-shouting march toward the lumpy potato sacks and the climbing dissipation of the most unbelievable violation. As he had jingled, he had reflected on the few occasions in which he’d ever smelled tobacco smoke in *his* store: all incidental, most very brief, and many followed by a lengthy, unreasonably self-deprecating apology. To just walk in his Temple of Domestic Fulfilment during this most Serene Time of Silent Service, spewing orange nicotine on his premium, Food & Drug Administration-blessed body and blood offering to the middle class was surely in ignorance, but could have even been *in spite*. Regardless, the transgression was worthy of the most merciless wrath, and he had been selected as its willing, capable vessel. In just the fifteen seconds it’d taken him to jingle his way to Aisle 1, he’d thought himself and his leather into flash-broiling, fast-rising fury.\n\nPerhaps the least expected sight that could have possibly greeted this Apostle of Appraisal on the far side of Aisle 1 – as he rounded the potato sack endcap and filled his *excuse me* lungs in preparation through his nose – was the labored lifting of the 125-pound eldest child of the new, Parisian-trained, full-time, certified cheese artisan – whom the store had just won out of 175 competitors in a region-wide raffle of her pilot program – by the dashing, swinging, and smoking real-life manifestation of a young Rich Uncle Pennybags, yet shock did not long halt the Keys & Leather.\n\n“Sir! Excuse me!”\n\n…\n\n“*Excuse me!* Sir!”\n\n…\n\nTheodore Pith – having reevaluated the girth of his intended booty – had propped his shiny black cane against the sill of the refrigerator and popped each slack bottom up off his oxfords from his shins before squatting over the massive Holy Wheel of the Artisan where it lay displayed on a sturdy bespoke plinth.\n\n…\n\n“Sir! You need to put out that cigar… the cigar – put it out immediately!”\n\nKeys & Leather had the odd inability to both shout and shuffle at the same time, so he’d only made it to the pomegranate juice by the time Pith had mustered enough momentum to swing the cheese child into a high enough pendulum to carry it stably facing forward under his chin with his two hands spaced evenly on the Great Wheel’s bottom.\n\n…\n\n“Sir! I’m going to have to ask you to put that down… That is a four thousand dollar item… If you want to buy it, we need to go about-”\n\n“…now, see here!” Pith had replied with great effort, in the midst of weighing in his mind the worth of the cane as a casualty, then of the monocle, too, which had fallen out while he was weighing, and of his own physical intelligence, and whether or not it was capable of retrieving the cane by its brass lion’s head handle via the top of a flicking foot without losing his balance. Keys & Leather, meanwhile, had been tortured at great length witnessing – in Theodore’s gravitational struggle – the Cuban’s ashes knocked all over the precious round Immanuel; the artisan’s Beloved, Chosen son of cheese – a nauseating sensation of loss overwhelming all hope of his store’s defense. The Terrible Theodore had at once noticed his hesitation *and* arrived upon a plan to leave no prop behind. He had leaned forward with the girth of the wheel and closed the remaining few feet between them, advancing with the huge mass of Nazarethian dairy to bear it all down upon the unsuspecting Leather, who in his grief for the prized wheel was far too slow to deflect its incoming mass.\n\n“Now, see here, chum!” Pith had forced from the furthest possible extremis of his best mob mouth as he transferred his burden all at once to its most concerned party, who collapsed against the multilayered tables that made up the fresh cookie display, with the weight of the wheel on his belly. As the stunned Leather struggled to separate himself without further soiling the only item in his store that sold for double a month’s paycheck, Theodore had replaced his monocle and returned for his cane in a single stride, which he’d then used after a return step to the pile of chocolate chip, almond nut, and fuming night manager to rap loose with the snout of the terrible brass cat Leather’s white knuckle-tight grip on the wheel with a lampoonish *haha!* before rolling the freed cheese toward the door in a villainous cackle.\n\n“Man, *come on*,” the defeated Leather had yelled halfheartedly from his pile of sweets, struggling against the awkward, slippery boxes for enough footing to stand. His efforts, though, were interrupted after a time by the abrupt mute of Pith’s cackling in the second swooshing of the front sliding doors – he had missed his last chance of pursuit. It had all been in vain – he’d failed to guard the crown jewel of the whole suburb. As he had given up the chase and the cheese and slumped once more against the ruined pile, the ridiculousness of the crime against him nearly cracked a smile, but soon was deterred by the very real thought of explaining what had happened to his General Manager when she arrived in just five hours. After a moment, there, covered in cookies, dust, ashes, and shame, he had quietly begun to sob.\n\nAfter he had regained control of his diaphragm, Lenny Lather had been amused, outside, by the varying velocities in which the smokers of the night shift gave in to their curiosities about the presence of the seven-figure collectible and its purpose in waiting at its now healthier idle in front of their grocery store in the loneliest time of a Tuesday morning. The first and the bravest had been the one who first spotted their intrusion – the shortest – if only because he had remained entirely convinced for the duration that *BLOOD* and its two, period-dressed occupants were nothing but an apparition of his dead Grandfather and Great Uncle like others he’d thought he’d seen before, and – though he’d been terrified by the clarity of this realest visit yet, he’d been irritated more than anything, and wanted to know “why the hell can’t you just leave me *alone*?!” The others behind him had been staggered in the proximity to the waiting car they had achieved – the lesser and most cowardly being the largest – the Sucking evangelist – who had been waiting for the great automobile to leave so he could forge the exchange of his broken Suck box for a new one from the back. In the delirium of his exhaustion and progressing frostbite, Lenny Lather had thought the image of the men where they were would make for an interesting, organic graph on the nature of courage – their positions simply representing their unaltered datapoints, and had been considering how best to deal with or respond to the nearer, deluded one, who had by then come close enough to the elegant, professionally polished front-right fender to reach out and touch it with his unwashed hands, and appeared to be taking the matter under serious consideration. He’d been seconds away from finally deciding between his idiotic ideas for a joke response when by far the largest wheel of cheese he’d ever seen had come rolling out of the opening doors onto the concrete, followed closely behind by Theodore Pith who’d still had three-quarters or more of his cigar left to smoke and apparently switched to cheap mob clichés in his brief absence.\n\n“Haste, Don Lenny!” he’d yelled, re-opening his closest cabin door to chuck his cane in first. He’d then straddled the great wheel to position it against the step before making a scene of grunting and huffing against its side with his full weight. Again, the bewildered smokers had fallen silent – they did not recognize the ridiculous delicacy because it was special inventory and could only be handled by the Holy Artisan herself. Lather had started revving the huge old straight-8 to answer Pith’s urgency, who had found himself fresh out of phrases after the wheel had finally succumbed to its capture and rolled into the footwell.\n\n“Make haste, make haste, my boy!” he’d shouted, diving theatrically into the covered back seat, head-first, to which his icing chauffer had responded by revving the behemoth and briskly popping her clutch, which had lurched the pair into the last, getaway stage of their late grocery heist. As *BLOOD*’s razor-edged hood ornament had sliced through the night by the dumbstruck smokers, Theodore Pith was unable to think of anything to shout at them as he passed but for “bada-bing, bada-*BOOM!*”\n\nThough the Lake Geneva Police Department was shown the security footage of that first theft by management, the theatricality of their matching getup had inadvertently obscured their identities, and the organization’s extreme deficit of imagination had left them stumped by the lack of license plates on the car, despite the free and effortless ability of just about any casual enthusiast of early American luxury automobiles and\/or lackadaisical disciple of the Concours religion to immediately identify *BLOOD* by *name* from the grainiest image, if consulted. If anything, their incompetence rewarded Pith and Lather’s continued focus on the products of the same store’s cheese artisan, as intelligence on the state of her latest flagship incubation was freely available with no more effort than it took to simply stop by her display amid regular shopping trips. Twice in two weeks, they stole both of her replacements for the biggest child without any significant alternation of their method, which frustrated her and the management nearly to the point of crises, and quickly lost all potential for fun in a third attempt – their kicks were in their absurdity, not their *effectiveness*, and neither of them cared much for the cheese.","views":39,"updated":"2022-04-20T11:48:57Z","tags":[],"type":null,"title":"Pith Test","slug":"pith-test","appearance":"sans","language":"en","rtl":false,"created":"2022-04-20T11:48:57Z","paid":false},{"id":"idmwdfu2zo05ss42","body":"- [Notes-How I Manage Drafts](drafts:\/\/open?uuid=939FF8C4-CB56-4A5F-99E9-D88E7162BE4E)\n- [Tilde](https:\/\/tilde.town\/~extratone\/drafts\/manage\/)\n- [WTF](https:\/\/davidblue.wtf\/drafts\/0BF34703-065D-4A2F-9F89-381A2348405E.html)\n\n![Drafts Library Summary](https:\/\/user-images.githubusercontent.com\/43663476\/163240429-65a75405-3535-415f-a47b-4e68073c9089.png)\n\n> Drafts made it too easy to dump my thoughts into text.\n\n> I have too many drafts to handle.

I’m not sure it would’ve occurred to me to attempt a straightforward guide exclusively on my own (file) management practices in Drafts had I not engaged with this thread, but my setup as it metamorphosed in the past year might actually be worth such a thing, come to think of it.\n\nHaving used Drafts so long, it’s notable that I can still remember being originally put off by most of its notes management methods at first, especially [Workspaces](https:\/\/docs.getdrafts.com\/docs\/drafts\/workspaces). Unfortunately, I couldn’t tell you how I originally dealt with them as I’ve flushed the entirety of my Drafts library at least three or four times since[^1]. Over the years, I’ve come to prefer Workspaces and [Tagging](https:\/\/docs.getdrafts.com\/docs\/drafts\/tagging) in Drafts over just about any other method of notes organization for my text living space.\n\nAlso worthy of note - if you weren’t already aware - is the fact that I am primarily a Drafts user on my [iPhone 12 Pro Max](https:\/\/github.com\/extratone\/jorts) [*with a paired Bluetooth keyboard*](https:\/\/extratone.github.io\/drafts\/#drafts-keyboard-shortcuts--ios-export-). This includes many special considerations. Along with Drafts’ support of [TextExpander](https:\/\/apps.apple.com\/us\/app\/textexpander-keyboard\/id1075927186), its malleable keyboard shortcuts are why I now use Drafts to launch into a significant number of non-Drafts-related tasks\/locations. From [Google searches](https:\/\/directory.getdrafts.com\/a\/1yu) to [calling Siri Shortcuts](https:\/\/actions.getdrafts.com\/a\/1xP), starting in Drafts allows me to attach keyboard shortcuts to a whole bunch of commands to which I’d be otherwise unable to.\n\n![Switcher Workspace](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/AKZ4458Q.png)\n\n## The Basics\n\nMost of my personal workspaces can be viewed\/downloaded via links in the README of [this GitHub repository](https:\/\/github.com\/extratone\/drafts), though they’re not going to be very useful beyond inspection.

I've thought a lot about what 15-year-old me could have possibly been thinking when I first Tweeting \"Watching Jimmy!\" from Twitter in the browser on my 2008 MacBook[^1] Of course, I've asked myself *which fucking Jimmy*, but not for years.

When I thought I might about cars for a living (and eventually did, post-2011,) I knew and exemplified how much a Twitter presence mattered. It was through Twitter that I met the only person to ever publish me, that the then-Editor-in-Chief of *Autoweek* “discovered” me, and through DMs that he asked me to apply for a job.[^3] Even from the very beginning, this was true, somehow, though it was so in a less [disaparagable](https:\/\/bilge.world\/social-media-strategy) sense, I’d say.\n\nhttps:\/\/twitter.com\/neoyokel\/status\/7775103604\n\nI was generally intolerable in 2010.

The operating system that thwarted the very idea of the Power User currently has numerous features that were added explicitly for them. (One might suggest this really began in iOS 12, with [Siri Shortcuts](http:\/\/bilge.world\/siri-shortcuts-ios12-review).) The trouble is that many of these features overlap into what the most average user might use in their day-to-day operation of their handsets and tablets. **Showing timestamps in iMessage**, for instance, is a function which one should not have to stumble upon or take to an internet search to find. (<u>Swipe from right to left in a conversation<\/u>.) Little functions like this are incredibly poorly documented, considering iOS is maintained by the most valuable company in the history of the world.\n\nApple does make an effort to educate new users, mainly through the [Tips app](https:\/\/apps.apple.com\/us\/app\/tips\/id1069509450), which has indeed become more useful and insightful over time, but still leaves a whole lot to be desired. They also publish an owner’s manual-esque *[iPhone Users Guide](https:\/\/itunes.apple.com\/WebObjects\/MZStore.woa\/wa\/viewBook?id=1515995528)*, which is unfortunately completely inaccessible in any format outside of the native Books app. (I made a not-insignificant effort to convert the volume to a PDF for your sake, but found myself completely defeated by DRM, hilariously.) Some of the functions listed in this post are accompanied by links to Apple Support web pages, but far too many have no such entries, which - from my perspective - is absolutely inexcusable on Apple’s part. Inexcusable, but perhaps not inexplicable. \n\nIt would seem that the vast ecosystem of both professional and amateur technology media which reports on iOS has inadvertently filled in for Apple in the role of documentarian. Search YouTube for “iPhone Tips” and you’ll manifest a multitude of results with titles like *[16 ACTUAL iPhone Tricks You Didn’t Know Existed!](https:\/\/youtu.be\/YKOY6-ZdUo8)* which haphazardly (and often distastefully) do the company’s job for them. Scrolling through said search results, I am compelled to reflect on all the *largely unpaid labor* for Apple, Inc. found there, but I will spare you such reflection for this Guide Post and promise to do my best to stick to function.\n\n## Syntax\n\nFor this \"guide,\" I think it's worth establishing a sort of micro-styleguide to begin with. When referring to a *function* or *task* I'm about to show you how to accomplish, its name will be in **bold text**. (Ex. **Close all Tabs in Safari**.) The *action(s)* or *input(s)* required to complete said task <u>will be underlined<\/u>. (Ex. <u>Long press on Tabs Icon<\/u>.)\n\n## From the Community\n\nMy suspicion regarding the general sentiment among iOS users was largely validated by the response to [**a thread I posted in r\/iOS**](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/ios\/comments\/l5p7ly\/underdocumented_ios_functions_stuff_you_wish\/). \n\n1. <u>Tap top status bar<\/u> to **scroll to top**\n   + (In Apollo, Tweetbot, and others, tapping again will take you back to where you started.)\n2.

After a childhood spent partially on a row-crop farm and indulging the activities and interests [uniquely enabled](https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/p\/CEsqIIoF-6s\/) by such a situation, I had cut that part of my life out entirely and moved in the suburban house full time of my mother and stepfather.

When I thought I might write about technology for a living (pre-2010,) I knew a Twitter presence mattered. When I thought I might about cars for a living (and eventually did, post-2011,) I knew and exemplified how much a Twitter presence mattered. It was through Twitter that I met the only person to ever publish me, that the then-Editor-in-Chief of *Autoweek* “discovered” me, and through DMs that he asked me to apply for a job.[^3] Even from the very beginning, this was true, somehow, though it was so in a less [disaparagable](https:\/\/bilge.world\/social-media-strategy) sense, I’d say.\n\nhttps:\/\/twitter.com\/neoyokel\/status\/7775103604\n\nI was generally intolerable in 2010.

Indeed, phenomena have there occurred of a nature so completely unexpected- so entirely novel- so utterly at variance with preconceived opinions- as to leave no doubt on my mind that long ere this all Europe is in an uproar, all physics in a ferment, all reason and astronomy together by the ears. date), a vast crowd of people, for purposes not specifically mentioned, were assembled in the great square of the Exchange in the well-conditioned city of Rotterdam. The day was warm- unusually so for the season- there was hardly a breath of air stirring; and the multitude were in no bad humor at being now and then besprinkled with friendly showers of momentary duration, that fell from large white masses of cloud which chequered in a fitful manner the blue vault of the firmament. Nevertheless, about noon, a slight but remarkable agitation became apparent in the assembly: the clattering of ten thousand tongues succeeded; and, in an instant afterward, ten thousand faces were upturned toward the heavens, ten thousand pipes descended simultaneously from the corners of ten thousand mouths, and a shout, which could be compared to nothing but the roaring of Niagara, resounded long, loudly, and furiously, through all the environs of Rotterdam.\n\nThe origin of this hubbub soon became sufficiently evident. From behind the huge bulk of one of those sharply-defined masses of cloud already mentioned, was seen slowly to emerge into an open area of blue space, a queer, heterogeneous, but apparently solid substance, so oddly shaped, so whimsically put together, as not to be in any manner comprehended, and never to be sufficiently admired, by the host of sturdy burghers who stood open-mouthed below. What could it be? In the name of all the vrows and devils in Rotterdam, what could it possibly portend? No one knew, no one could imagine; no one- not even the burgomaster Mynheer Superbus Von Underduk- had the slightest clew by which to unravel the mystery; so, as nothing more reasonable could be done, every one to a man replaced his pipe carefully in the corner of his mouth, and cocking up his right eye towards the phenomenon, puffed, paused, waddled about, and grunted significantly- then waddled back, grunted, paused, and finally- puffed again.\n\nIn the meantime, however, lower and still lower toward the goodly city, came the object of so much curiosity, and the cause of so much smoke. In a very few minutes it arrived near enough to be accurately discerned. It appeared to be- yes! it was undoubtedly a species of balloon; but surely no such balloon had ever been seen in Rotterdam before. For who, let me ask, ever heard of a balloon manufactured entirely of dirty newspapers? No man in Holland certainly; yet here, under the very noses of the people, or rather at some distance above their noses was the identical thing in question, and composed, I have it on the best authority, of the precise material which no one had ever before known to be used for a similar purpose. It was an egregious insult to the good sense of the burghers of Rotterdam. As to the shape of the phenomenon, it was even still more reprehensible. Being little or nothing better than a huge foolscap turned upside down. And this similitude was regarded as by no means lessened when, upon nearer inspection, there was perceived a large tassel depending from its apex, and, around the upper rim or base of the cone, a circle of little instruments, resembling sheep-bells, which kept up a continual tinkling to the tune of Betty Martin. But still worse. Suspended by blue ribbons to the end of this fantastic machine, there hung, by way of car, an enormous drab beaver bat, with a brim superlatively broad, and a hemispherical crown with a black band and a silver buckle. It is, however, somewhat remarkable that many citizens of Rotterdam swore to having seen the same hat repeatedly before; and indeed the whole assembly seemed to regard it with eyes of familiarity; while the vrow Grettel Phaall, upon sight of it, uttered an exclamation of joyful surprise, and declared it to be the identical hat of her good man himself. Now this was a circumstance the more to be observed, as Phaall, with three companions, had actually disappeared from Rotterdam about five years before, in a very sudden and unaccountable manner, and up to the date of this narrative all attempts had failed of obtaining any intelligence concerning them whatsoever. To be sure, some bones which were thought to be human, mixed up with a quantity of odd-looking rubbish, had been lately discovered in a retired situation to the east of Rotterdam, and some people went so far as to imagine that in this spot a foul murder had been committed, and that the sufferers were in all probability Hans Phaall and his associates. But to return.\n\nThe balloon (for such no doubt it was) had now descended to within a hundred feet of the earth, allowing the crowd below a sufficiently distinct view of the person of its occupant. This was in truth a very droll little somebody. He could not have been more than two feet in height; but this altitude, little as it was, would have been sufficient to destroy his equilibrium, and tilt him over the edge of his tiny car, but for the intervention of a circular rim reaching as high as the breast, and rigged on to the cords of the balloon. The body of the little man was more than proportionately broad, giving to his entire figure a rotundity highly absurd. His feet, of course, could not be seen at all, although a horny substance of suspicious nature was occasionally protruded through a rent in the bottom of the car, or to speak more properly, in the top of the hat. His hands were enormously large. His hair was extremely gray, and collected in a cue behind. His nose was prodigiously long, crooked, and inflammatory; his eyes full, brilliant, and acute; his chin and cheeks, although wrinkled with age, were broad, puffy, and double; but of ears of any kind or character there was not a semblance to be discovered upon any portion of his head. This odd little gentleman was dressed in a loose surtout of sky-blue satin, with tight breeches to match, fastened with silver buckles at the knees. His vest was of some bright yellow material; a white taffety cap was set jauntily on one side of his head; and, to complete his equipment, a blood-red silk handkerchief enveloped his throat, and fell down, in a dainty manner, upon his bosom, in a fantastic bow-knot of super-eminent dimensions.\n\nHaving descended, as I said before, to about one hundred feet from the surface of the earth, the little old gentleman was suddenly seized with a fit of trepidation, and appeared disinclined to make any nearer approach to terra firma. Throwing out, therefore, a quantity of sand from a canvas bag, which, he lifted with great difficulty, he became stationary in an instant. He then proceeded, in a hurried and agitated manner, to extract from a side-pocket in his surtout a large morocco pocket-book. This he poised suspiciously in his hand, then eyed it with an air of extreme surprise, and was evidently astonished at its weight. He at length opened it, and drawing there from a huge letter sealed with red sealing-wax and tied carefully with red tape, let it fall precisely at the feet of the burgomaster, Superbus Von Underduk. His Excellency stooped to take it up. But the aeronaut, still greatly discomposed, and having apparently no farther business to detain him in Rotterdam, began at this moment to make busy preparations for departure; and it being necessary to discharge a portion of ballast to enable him to reascend, the half dozen bags which he threw out, one after another, without taking the trouble to empty their contents, tumbled, every one of them, most unfortunately upon the back of the burgomaster, and rolled him over and over no less than one-and-twenty times, in the face of every man in Rotterdam. It is not to be supposed, however, that the great Underduk suffered this impertinence on the part of the little old man to pass off with impunity. It is said, on the contrary, that during each and every one of his one-and twenty circumvolutions he emitted no less than one-and-twenty distinct and furious whiffs from his pipe, to which he held fast the whole time with all his might, and to which he intends holding fast until the day of his death.\n\nIn the meantime the balloon arose like a lark, and, soaring far away above the city, at length drifted quietly behind a cloud similar to that from which it had so oddly emerged, and was thus lost forever to the wondering eyes of the good citiezns of Rotterdam. All attention was now directed to the letter, the descent of which, and the consequences attending thereupon, had proved so fatally subversive of both person and personal dignity to his Excellency, the illustrious Burgomaster Mynheer Superbus Von Underduk. That functionary, however, had not failed, during his circumgyratory movements, to bestow a thought upon the important subject of securing the packet in question, which was seen, upon inspection, to have fallen into the most proper hands, being actually addressed to himself and Professor Rub-a-dub, in their official capacities of President and Vice-President of the Rotterdam College of Astronomy. It was accordingly opened by those dignitaries upon the spot, and found to contain the following extraordinary, and indeed very serious, communications.\n\n> To their Excellencies Von Underduk and Rub-a-dub, President and Vice-President of the States' College of Astronomers, in the city of Rotterdam.\n\n> Your Excellencies may perhaps be able to remember an humble artizan, by name Hans Phaall, and by occupation a mender of bellows, who, with three others, disappeared from Rotterdam, about five years ago, in a manner which must have been considered by all parties at once sudden, and extremely unaccountable. If, however, it so please your Excellencies, I, the writer of this communication, am the identical Hans Phaall himself. It is well known to most of my fellow citizens, that for the period of forty years I continued to occupy the little square brick building, at the head of the alley called Sauerkraut, in which I resided at the time of my disappearance. My ancestors have also resided therein time out of mind- they, as well as myself, steadily following the respectable and indeed lucrative profession of mending of bellows. For, to speak the truth, until of late years, that the heads of all the people have been set agog with politics, no better business than my own could an honest citizen of Rotterdam either desire or deserve. Credit was good, employment was never wanting, and on all hands there was no lack of either money or good-will. But, as I was saying, we soon began to feel the effects of liberty and long speeches, and radicalism, and all that sort of thing. People who were formerly, the very best customers in the world, had now not a moment of time to think of us at all. They had, so they said, as much as they could do to read about the revolutions, and keep up with the march of intellect and the spirit of the age. If a fire wanted fanning, it could readily be fanned with a newspaper, and as the government grew weaker, I have no doubt that leather and iron acquired durability in proportion, for, in a very short time, there was not a pair of bellows in all Rotterdam that ever stood in need of a stitch or required the assistance of a hammer. This was a state of things not to be endured. I soon grew as poor as a rat, and, having a wife and children to provide for, my burdens at length became intolerable, and I spent hour after hour in reflecting upon the most convenient method of putting an end to my life. Duns, in the meantime, left me little leisure for contemplation. My house was literally besieged from morning till night, so that I began to rave, and foam, and fret like a caged tiger against the bars of his enclosure. There were three fellows in particular who worried me beyond endurance, keeping watch continually about my door, and threatening me with the law. Upon these three I internally vowed the bitterest revenge, if ever I should be so happy as to get them within my clutches; and I believe nothing in the world but the pleasure of this anticipation prevented me from putting my plan of suicide into immediate execution, by blowing my brains out with a blunderbuss. I thought it best, however, to dissemble my wrath, and to treat them with promises and fair words, until, by some good turn of fate, an opportunity of vengeance should be afforded me.\n\n> One day, having given my creditors the slip, and feeling more than usually dejected, I continued for a long time to wander about the most obscure streets without object whatever, until at length I chanced to stumble against the corner of a bookseller's stall. Seeing a chair close at hand, for the use of customers, I threw myself doggedly into it, and, hardly knowing why, opened the pages of the first volume which came within my reach. It proved to be a small pamphlet treatise on Speculative Astronomy, written either by Professor Encke of Berlin or by a Frenchman of somewhat similar name. I had some little tincture of information on matters of this nature, and soon became more and more absorbed in the contents of the book, reading it actually through twice before I awoke to a recollection of what was passing around me. By this time it began to grow dark, and I directed my steps toward home. But the treatise had made an indelible impression on my mind, and, as I sauntered along the dusky streets, I revolved carefully over in my memory the wild and sometimes unintelligible reasonings of the writer. There are some particular passages which affected my imagination in a powerful and extraordinary manner. The longer I meditated upon these the more intense grew the interest which had been excited within me. The limited nature of my education in general, and more especially my ignorance on subjects connected with natural philosophy, so far from rendering me diffident of my own ability to comprehend what I had read, or inducing me to mistrust the many vague notions which had arisen in consequence, merely served as a farther stimulus to imagination; and I was vain enough, or perhaps reasonable enough, to doubt whether those crude ideas which, arising in ill-regulated minds, have all the appearance, may not often in effect possess all the force, the reality, and other inherent properties, of instinct or intuition; whether, to proceed a step farther, profundity itself might not, in matters of a purely speculative nature, be detected as a legitimate source of falsity and error. In other words, I believed, and still do believe, that truth, is frequently of its own essence, superficial, and that, in many cases, the depth lies more in the abysses where we seek her, than in the actual situations wherein she may be found. Nature herself seemed to afford me corroboration of these ideas. In the contemplation of the heavenly bodies it struck me forcibly that I could not distinguish a star with nearly as much precision, when I gazed on it with earnest, direct and undeviating attention, as when I suffered my eye only to glance in its vicinity alone. I was not, of course, at that time aware that this apparent paradox was occasioned by the center of the visual area being less susceptible of feeble impressions of light than the exterior portions of the retina. This knowledge, and some of another kind, came afterwards in the course of an eventful five years, during which I have dropped the prejudices of my former humble situation in life, and forgotten the bellows-mender in far different occupations. But at the epoch of which I speak, the analogy which a casual observation of a star offered to the conclusions I had already drawn, struck me with the force of positive conformation, and I then finally made up my mind to the course which I afterwards pursued.\n\n> It was late when I reached home, and I went immediately to bed. My mind, however, was too much occupied to sleep, and I lay the whole night buried in meditation. Arising early in the morning, and contriving again to escape the vigilance of my creditors, I repaired eagerly to the bookseller's stall, and laid out what little ready money I possessed, in the purchase of some volumes of Mechanics and Practical Astronomy. Having arrived at home safely with these, I devoted every spare moment to their perusal, and soon made such proficiency in studies of this nature as I thought sufficient for the execution of my plan. In the intervals of this period, I made every endeavor to conciliate the three creditors who had given me so much annoyance. In this I finally succeeded- partly by selling enough of my household furniture to satisfy a moiety of their claim, and partly by a promise of paying the balance upon completion of a little project which I told them I had in view, and for assistance in which I solicited their services. By these means- for they were ignorant men- I found little difficulty in gaining them over to my purpose.\n\n> Matters being thus arranged, I contrived, by the aid of my wife and with the greatest secrecy and caution, to dispose of what property I had remaining, and to borrow, in small sums, under various pretences, and without paying any attention to my future means of repayment, no inconsiderable quantity of ready money. With the means thus accruing I proceeded to procure at intervals, cambric muslin, very fine, in pieces of twelve yards each; twine; a lot of the varnish of caoutchouc; a large and deep basket of wicker-work, made to order; and several other articles necessary in the construction and equipment of a balloon of extraordinary dimensions. This I directed my wife to make up as soon as possible, and gave her all requisite information as to the particular method of proceeding. In the meantime I worked up the twine into a net-work of sufficient dimensions; rigged it with a hoop and the necessary cords; bought a quadrant, a compass, a spy-glass, a common barometer with some important modifications, and two astronomical instruments not so generally known. I then took opportunities of conveying by night, to a retired situation east of Rotterdam, five iron-bound casks, to contain about fifty gallons each, and one of a larger size; six tinned ware tubes, three inches in diameter, properly shaped, and ten feet in length; a quantity of a particular metallic substance, or semi-metal, which I shall not name, and a dozen demijohns of a very common acid. The gas to be formed from these latter materials is a gas never yet generated by any other person than myself- or at least never applied to any similar purpose. The secret I would make no difficulty in disclosing, but that it of right belongs to a citizen of Nantz, in France, by whom it was conditionally communicated to myself. The same individual submitted to me, without being at all aware of my intentions, a method of constructing balloons from the membrane of a certain animal, through which substance any escape of gas was nearly an impossibility. I found it, however, altogether too expensive, and was not sure, upon the whole, whether cambric muslin with a coating of gum caoutchouc, was not equally as good. I mention this circumstance, because I think it probable that hereafter the individual in question may attempt a balloon ascension with the novel gas and material I have spoken of, and I do not wish to deprive him of the honor of a very singular invention.\n\n> On the spot which I intended each of the smaller casks to occupy respectively during the inflation of the balloon, I privately dug a hole two feet deep; the holes forming in this manner a circle twenty-five feet in diameter. In the centre of this circle, being the station designed for the large cask, I also dug a hole three feet in depth. In each of the five smaller holes, I deposited a canister containing fifty pounds, and in the larger one a keg holding one hundred and fifty pounds, of cannon powder. These- the keg and canisters- I connected in a proper manner with covered trains; and having let into one of the canisters the end of about four feet of slow match, I covered up the hole, and placed the cask over it, leaving the other end of the match protruding about an inch, and barely visible beyond the cask. I then filled up the remaining holes, and placed the barrels over them in their destined situation.\n\n> Besides the articles above enumerated, I conveyed to the depot, and there secreted, one of M. Grimm's improvements upon the apparatus for condensation of the atmospheric air. I found this machine, however, to require considerable alteration before it could be adapted to the purposes to which I intended making it applicable. But, with severe labor and unremitting perseverance, I at length met with entire success in all my preparations. My balloon was soon completed. It would contain more than forty thousand cubic feet of gas; would take me up easily, I calculated, with all my implements, and, if I managed rightly, with one hundred and seventy-five pounds of ballast into the bargain. It had received three coats of varnish, and I found the cambric muslin to answer all the purposes of silk itself, quite as strong and a good deal less expensive.\n\n> Everything being now ready, I exacted from my wife an oath of secrecy in relation to all my actions from the day of my first visit to the bookseller's stall; and promising, on my part, to return as soon as circumstances would permit, I gave her what little money I had left, and bade her farewell. Indeed I had no fear on her account. She was what people call a notable woman, and could manage matters in the world without my assistance. I believe, to tell the truth, she always looked upon me as an idle boy, a mere make-weight, good for nothing but building castles in the air, and was rather glad to get rid of me. It was a dark night when I bade her good-bye, and taking with me, as aides-de-camp, the three creditors who had given me so much trouble, we carried the balloon, with the car and accoutrements, by a roundabout way, to the station where the other articles were deposited. We there found them all unmolested, and I proceeded immediately to business.\n\n> It was the first of April. The night, as I said before, was dark; there was not a star to be seen; and a drizzling rain, falling at intervals, rendered us very uncomfortable. But my chief anxiety was concerning the balloon, which, in spite of the varnish with which it was defended, began to grow rather heavy with the moisture; the powder also was liable to damage. I therefore kept my three duns working with great diligence, pounding down ice around the central cask, and stirring the acid in the others. They did not cease, however, importuning me with questions as to what I intended to do with all this apparatus, and expressed much dissatisfaction at the terrible labor I made them undergo. They could not perceive, so they said, what good was likely to result from their getting wet to the skin, merely to take a part in such horrible incantations. I began to get uneasy, and worked away with all my might, for I verily believe the idiots supposed that I had entered into a compact with the devil, and that, in short, what I was now doing was nothing better than it should be. I was, therefore, in great fear of their leaving me altogether. I contrived, however, to pacify them by promises of payment of all scores in full, as soon as I could bring the present business to a termination. To these speeches they gave, of course, their own interpretation; fancying, no doubt, that at all events I should come into possession of vast quantities of ready money; and provided I paid them all I owed, and a trifle more, in consideration of their services, I dare say they cared very little what became of either my soul or my carcass.\n\n> In about four hours and a half I found the balloon sufficiently inflated. I attached the car, therefore, and put all my implements in it- not forgetting the condensing apparatus, a copious supply of water, and a large quantity of provisions, such as pemmican, in which much nutriment is contained in comparatively little bulk. I also secured in the car a pair of pigeons and a cat. It was now nearly daybreak, and I thought it high time to take my departure. Dropping a lighted cigar on the ground, as if by accident, I took the opportunity, in stooping to pick it up, of igniting privately the piece of slow match, whose end, as I said before, protruded a very little beyond the lower rim of one of the smaller casks. This manoeuvre was totally unperceived on the part of the three duns; and, jumping into the car, I immediately cut the single cord which held me to the earth, and was pleased to find that I shot upward, carrying with all ease one hundred and seventy-five pounds of leaden ballast, and able to have carried up as many more.\n\n> Scarcely, however, had I attained the height of fifty yards, when, roaring and rumbling up after me in the most horrible and tumultuous manner, came so dense a hurricane of fire, and smoke, and sulphur, and legs and arms, and gravel, and burning wood, and blazing metal, that my very heart sunk within me, and I fell down in the bottom of the car, trembling with unmitigated terror. Indeed, I now perceived that I had entirely overdone the business, and that the main consequences of the shock were yet to be experienced. Accordingly, in less than a second, I felt all the blood in my body rushing to my temples, and immediately thereupon, a concussion, which I shall never forget, burst abruptly through the night and seemed to rip the very firmament asunder. When I afterward had time for reflection, I did not fail to attribute the extreme violence of the explosion, as regarded myself, to its proper cause- my situation directly above it, and in the line of its greatest power. But at the time, I thought only of preserving my life. The balloon at first collapsed, then furiously expanded, then whirled round and round with horrible velocity, and finally, reeling and staggering like a drunken man, hurled me with great force over the rim of the car, and left me dangling, at a terrific height, with my head downward, and my face outwards, by a piece of slender cord about three feet in length, which hung accidentally through a crevice near the bottom of the wicker-work, and in which, as I fell, my left foot became most providentially entangled. It is impossible- utterly impossible- to form any adequate idea of the horror of my situation. I gasped convulsively for breath- a shudder resembling a fit of the ague agitated every nerve and muscle of my frame- I felt my eyes starting from their sockets- a horrible nausea overwhelmed me- and at length I fainted away.\n\n> How long I remained in this state it is impossible to say. It must, however, have been no inconsiderable time, for when I partially recovered the sense of existence, I found the day breaking, the balloon at a prodigious height over a wilderness of ocean, and not a trace of land to be discovered far and wide within the limits of the vast horizon. My sensations, however, upon thus recovering, were by no means so rife with agony as might have been anticipated. Indeed, there was much of incipient madness in the calm survey which I began to take of my situation. I drew up to my eyes each of my hands, one after the other, and wondered what occurrence could have given rise to the swelling of the veins, and the horrible blackness of the fingemails. I afterward carefully examined my head, shaking it repeatedly, and feeling it with minute attention, until I succeeded in satisfying myself that it was not, as I had more than half suspected, larger than my balloon. Then, in a knowing manner, I felt in both my breeches pockets, and, missing therefrom a set of tablets and a toothpick case, endeavored to account for their disappearance, and not being able to do so, felt inexpressibly chagrined. It now occurred to me that I suffered great uneasiness in the joint of my left ankle, and a dim consciousness of my situation began to glimmer through my mind. But, strange to say! I was neither astonished nor horror-stricken. If I felt any emotion at all, it was a kind of chuckling satisfaction at the cleverness I was about to display in extricating myself from this dilemma; and I never, for a moment, looked upon my ultimate safety as a question susceptible of doubt. For a few minutes I remained wrapped in the profoundest meditation. I have a distinct recollection of frequently compressing my lips, putting my forefinger to the side of my nose, and making use of other gesticulations and grimaces common to men who, at ease in their arm-chairs, meditate upon matters of intricacy or importance. Having, as I thought, sufficiently collected my ideas, I now, with great caution and deliberation, put my hands behind my back, and unfastened the large iron buckle which belonged to the waistband of my inexpressibles. This buckle had three teeth, which, being somewhat rusty, turned with great difficulty on their axis. I brought them, however, after some trouble, at right angles to the body of the buckle, and was glad to find them remain firm in that position. Holding the instrument thus obtained within my teeth, I now proceeded to untie the knot of my cravat. I had to rest several times before I could accomplish this manoeuvre, but it was at length accomplished. To one end of the cravat I then made fast the buckle, and the other end I tied, for greater security, tightly around my wrist. Drawing now my body upwards, with a prodigious exertion of muscular force, I succeeded, at the very first trial, in throwing the buckle over the car, and entangling it, as I had anticipated, in the circular rim of the wicker-work.\n\n> My body was now inclined towards the side of the car, at an angle of about forty-five degrees; but it must not be understood that I was therefore only forty-five degrees below the perpendicular. So far from it, I still lay nearly level with the plane of the horizon; for the change of situation which I had acquired, had forced the bottom of the car considerably outwards from my position, which was accordingly one of the most imminent and deadly peril. It should be remembered, however, that when I fell in the first instance, from the car, if I had fallen with my face turned toward the balloon, instead of turned outwardly from it, as it actually was; or if, in the second place, the cord by which I was suspended had chanced to hang over the upper edge, instead of through a crevice near the bottom of the car,- I say it may be readily conceived that, in either of these supposed cases, I should have been unable to accomplish even as much as I had now accomplished, and the wonderful adventures of Hans Phaall would have been utterly lost to posterity, I had therefore every reason to be grateful; although, in point of fact, I was still too stupid to be anything at all, and hung for, perhaps, a quarter of an hour in that extraordinary manner, without making the slightest farther exertion whatsoever, and in a singularly tranquil state of idiotic enjoyment. But this feeling did not fail to die rapidly away, and thereunto succeeded horror, and dismay, and a chilling sense of utter helplessness and ruin. In fact, the blood so long accumulating in the vessels of my head and throat, and which had hitherto buoyed up my spirits with madness and delirium, had now begun to retire within their proper channels, and the distinctness which was thus added to my perception of the danger, merely served to deprive me of the self-possession and courage to encounter it. But this weakness was, luckily for me, of no very long duration. In good time came to my rescue the spirit of despair, and, with frantic cries and struggles, I jerked my way bodily upwards, till at length, clutching with a vise-like grip the long-desired rim, I writhed my person over it, and fell headlong and shuddering within the car.\n\n> It was not until some time afterward that I recovered myself sufficiently to attend to the ordinary cares of the balloon. I then, however, examined it with attention, and found it, to my great relief, uninjured. My implements were all safe, and, fortunately, I had lost neither ballast nor provisions. Indeed, I had so well secured them in their places, that such an accident was entirely out of the question. Looking at my watch, I found it six o'clock. I was still rapidly ascending, and my barometer gave a present altitude of three and three-quarter miles. Immediately beneath me in the ocean, lay a small black object, slightly oblong in shape, seemingly about the size, and in every way bearing a great resemblance to one of those childish toys called a domino. Bringing my telescope to bear upon it, I plainly discerned it to be a British ninety four-gun ship, close-hauled, and pitching heavily in the sea with her head to the W.S.W. Besides this ship, I saw nothing but the ocean and the sky, and the sun, which had long arisen.\n\n> It is now high time that I should explain to your Excellencies the object of my perilous voyage. Your Excellencies will bear in mind that distressed circumstances in Rotterdam had at length driven me to the resolution of committing suicide. It was not, however, that to life itself I had any, positive disgust, but that I was harassed beyond endurance by the adventitious miseries attending my situation. In this state of mind, wishing to live, yet wearied with life, the treatise at the stall of the bookseller opened a resource to my imagination. I then finally made up my mind. I determined to depart, yet live- to leave the world, yet continue to exist- in short, to drop enigmas, I resolved, let what would ensue, to force a passage, if I could, to the moon. Now, lest I should be supposed more of a madman than I actually am, I will detail, as well as I am able, the considerations which led me to believe that an achievement of this nature, although without doubt difficult, and incontestably full of danger, was not absolutely, to a bold spirit, beyond the confines of the possible.\n\n> The moon's actual distance from the earth was the first thing to be attended to. Now, the mean or average interval between the centres of the two planets is 59.9643 of the earth's equatorial radii, or only about 237,000 miles. I say the mean or average interval. But it must be borne in mind that the form of the moon's orbit being an ellipse of eccentricity amounting to no less than 0.05484 of the major semi-axis of the ellipse itself, and the earth's centre being situated in its focus, if I could, in any manner, contrive to meet the moon, as it were, in its perigee, the above mentioned distance would be materially diminished. But, to say nothing at present of this possibility, it was very certain that, at all events, from the 237,000 miles I would have to deduct the radius of the earth, say 4,000, and the radius of the moon, say 1080, in all 5,080, leaving an actual interval to be traversed, under average circumstances, of 231,920 miles. Now this, I reflected, was no very extraordinary distance. Travelling on land has been repeatedly accomplished at the rate of thirty miles per hour, and indeed a much greater speed may be anticipated. But even at this velocity, it would take me no more than 322 days to reach the surface of the moon. There were, however, many particulars inducing me to believe that my average rate of travelling might possibly very much exceed that of thirty miles per hour, and, as these considerations did not fail to make a deep impression upon my mind, I will mention them more fully hereafter.\n\n> The next point to be regarded was a matter of far greater importance. From indications afforded by the barometer, we find that, in ascensions from the surface of the earth we have, at the height of 1,000 feet, left below us about one-thirtieth of the entire mass of atmospheric air, that at 10,600 we have ascended through nearly one-third; and that at 18,000, which is not far from the elevation of Cotopaxi, we have surmounted one-half the material, or, at all events, one-half the ponderable, body of air incumbent upon our globe. It is also calculated that at an altitude not exceeding the hundredth part of the earth's diameter- that is, not exceeding eighty miles- the rarefaction would be so excessive that animal life could in no manner be sustained, and, moreover, that the most delicate means we possess of ascertaining the presence of the atmosphere would be inadequate to assure us of its existence. But I did not fail to perceive that these latter calculations are founded altogether on our experimental knowledge of the properties of air, and the mechanical laws regulating its dilation and compression, in what may be called, comparatively speaking, the immediate vicinity of the earth itself; and, at the same time, it is taken for granted that animal life is and must be essentially incapable of modification at any given unattainable distance from the surface. Now, all such reasoning and from such data must, of course, be simply analogical. The greatest height ever reached by man was that of 25,000 feet, attained in the aeronautic expedition of Messieurs Gay-Lussac and Biot. This is a moderate altitude, even when compared with the eighty miles in question; and I could not help thinking that the subject admitted room for doubt and great latitude for speculation.\n\n> But, in point of fact, an ascension being made to any given altitude, the ponderable quantity of air surmounted in any farther ascension is by no means in proportion to the additional height ascended (as may be plainly seen from what has been stated before), but in a ratio constantly decreasing. It is therefore evident that, ascend as high as we may, we cannot, literally speaking, arrive at a limit beyond which no atmosphere is to be found. It must exist, I argued; although it may exist in a state of infinite rarefaction.\n\n> On the other hand, I was aware that arguments have not been wanting to prove the existence of a real and definite limit to the atmosphere, beyond which there is absolutely no air whatsoever. But a circumstance which has been left out of view by those who contend for such a limit seemed to me, although no positive refutation of their creed, still a point worthy very serious investigation. On comparing the intervals between the successive arrivals of Encke's comet at its perihelion, after giving credit, in the most exact manner, for all the disturbances due to the attractions of the planets, it appears that the periods are gradually diminishing; that is to say, the major axis of the comet's ellipse is growing shorter, in a slow but perfectly regular decrease. Now, this is precisely what ought to be the case, if we suppose a resistance experienced from the comet from an extremely rare ethereal medium pervading the regions of its orbit. For it is evident that such a medium must, in retarding the comet's velocity, increase its centripetal, by weakening its centrifugal force. In other words, the sun's attraction would be constantly attaining greater power, and the comet would be drawn nearer at every revolution. Indeed, there is no other way of accounting for the variation in question. But again. The real diameter of the same comet's nebulosity is observed to contract rapidly as it approaches the sun, and dilate with equal rapidity in its departure towards its aphelion. Was I not justifiable in supposing with M. Valz, that this apparent condensation of volume has its origin in the compression of the same ethereal medium I have spoken of before, and which is only denser in proportion to its solar vicinity? The lenticular-shaped phenomenon, also called the zodiacal light, was a matter worthy of attention. This radiance, so apparent in the tropics, and which cannot be mistaken for any meteoric lustre, extends from the horizon obliquely upward, and follows generally the direction of the sun's equator. It appeared to me evidently in the nature of a rare atmosphere extending from the sun outward, beyond the orbit of Venus at least, and I believed indefinitely farther.* Indeed, this medium I could not suppose confined to the path of the comet's ellipse, or to the immediate neighborhood of the sun. It was easy, on the contrary, to imagine it pervading the entire regions of our planetary system, condensed into what we call atmosphere at the planets themselves, and perhaps at some of them modified by considerations, so to speak, purely geological.\n> *The zodiacal light is probably what the ancients called Trabes. Emicant Trabes quos docos vocant.- Pliny, lib. 2, p. 26.\n\n> Having adopted this view of the subject, I had little further hesitation. Granting that on my passage I should meet with atmosphere essentially the same as at the surface of the earth, I conceived that, by means of the very ingenious apparatus of M. Grimm, I should readily be enabled to condense it in sufficient quantity for the purposes of respiration. This would remove the chief obstacle in a journey to the moon. I had indeed spent some money and great labor in adapting the apparatus to the object intended, and confidently looked forward to its successful application, if I could manage to complete the voyage within any reasonable period. This brings me back to the rate at which it might be possible to travel.\n\n> It is true that balloons, in the first stage of their ascensions from the earth, are known to rise with a velocity comparatively moderate. Now, the power of elevation lies altogether in the superior lightness of the gas in the balloon compared with the atmospheric air; and, at first sight, it does not appear probable that, as the balloon acquires altitude, and consequently arrives successively in atmospheric strata of densities rapidly diminishing- I say, it does not appear at all reasonable that, in this its progress upwards, the original velocity should be accelerated. On the other hand, I was not aware that, in any recorded ascension, a diminution was apparent in the absolute rate of ascent; although such should have been the case, if on account of nothing else, on account of the escape of gas through balloons ill-constructed, and varnished with no better material than the ordinary varnish. It seemed, therefore, that the effect of such escape was only sufficient to counterbalance the effect of some accelerating power. I now considered that, provided in my passage I found the medium I had imagined, and provided that it should prove to be actually and essentially what we denominate atmospheric air, it could make comparatively little difference at what extreme state of rarefaction I should discover it- that is to say, in regard to my power of ascending- for the gas in the balloon would not only be itself subject to rarefaction partially similar (in proportion to the occurrence of which, I could suffer an escape of so much as would be requisite to prevent explosion), but, being what it was, would, at all events, continue specifically lighter than any compound whatever of mere nitrogen and oxygen. In the meantime, the force of gravitation would be constantly diminishing, in proportion to the squares of the distances, and thus, with a velocity prodigiously accelerating, I should at length arrive in those distant regions where the force of the earth's attraction would be superseded by that of the moon. In accordance with these ideas, I did not think it worth while to encumber myself with more provisions than would be sufficient for a period of forty days.\n\n> There was still, however, another difficulty, which occasioned me some little disquietude. It has been observed, that, in balloon ascensions to any considerable height, besides the pain attending respiration, great uneasiness is experienced about the head and body, often accompanied with bleeding at the nose, and other symptoms of an alarming kind, and growing more and more inconvenient in proportion to the altitude attained.* This was a reflection of a nature somewhat startling. Was it not probable that these symptoms would increase indefinitely, or at least until terminated by death itself? I finally thought not. Their origin was to be looked for in the progressive removal of the customary atmospheric pressure upon the surface of the body, and consequent distention of the superficial blood-vessels- not in any positive disorganization of the animal system, as in the case of difficulty in breathing, where the atmospheric density is chemically insufficient for the due renovation of blood in a ventricle of the heart. Unless for default of this renovation, I could see no reason, therefore, why life could not be sustained even in a vacuum; for the expansion and compression of chest, commonly called breathing, is action purely muscular, and the cause, not the effect, of respiration. In a word, I conceived that, as the body should become habituated to the want of atmospheric pressure, the sensations of pain would gradually diminish- and to endure them while they continued, I relied with confidence upon the iron hardihood of my constitution.\n> *Since the original publication of Hans Phaall, I find that Mr. Green, of Nassau balloon notoriety, and other late aeronauts, deny the assertions of Humboldt, in this respect, and speak of a decreasing inconvenience,- precisely in accordance with the theory here urged in a mere spirit of banter.\n\n> Thus, may it please your Excellencies, I have detailed some, though by no means all, the considerations which led me to form the project of a lunar voyage. I shall now proceed to lay before you the result of an attempt so apparently audacious in conception, and, at all events, so utterly unparalleled in the annals of mankind.\n\n> Having attained the altitude before mentioned, that is to say three miles and three-quarters, I threw out from the car a quantity of feathers, and found that I still ascended with sufficient rapidity; there was, therefore, no necessity for discharging any ballast. I was glad of this, for I wished to retain with me as much weight as I could carry, for reasons which will be explained in the sequel. I as yet suffered no bodily inconvenience, breathing with great freedom, and feeling no pain whatever in the head. The cat was lying very demurely upon my coat, which I had taken off, and eyeing the pigeons with an air of nonchalance. These latter being tied by the leg, to prevent their escape, were busily employed in picking up some grains of rice scattered for them in the bottom of the car.\n\n> At twenty minutes past six o'clock, the barometer showed an elevation of 26,400 feet, or five miles to a fraction. The prospect seemed unbounded. Indeed, it is very easily calculated by means of spherical geometry, what a great extent of the earth's area I beheld. The convex surface of any segment of a sphere is, to the entire surface of the sphere itself, as the versed sine of the segment to the diameter of the sphere. Now, in my case, the versed sine- that is to say, the thickness of the segment beneath me- was about equal to my elevation, or the elevation of the point of sight above the surface. \"As five miles, then, to eight thousand,\" would express the proportion of the earth's area seen by me. In other words, I beheld as much as a sixteen-hundredth part of the whole surface of the globe. The sea appeared unruffled as a mirror, although, by means of the spy-glass, I could perceive it to be in a state of violent agitation. The ship was no longer visible, having drifted away, apparently to the eastward. I now began to experience, at intervals, severe pain in the head, especially about the ears- still, however, breathing with tolerable freedom. The cat and pigeons seemed to suffer no inconvenience whatsoever.\n\n> At twenty minutes before seven, the balloon entered a long series of dense cloud, which put me to great trouble, by damaging my condensing apparatus and wetting me to the skin. This was, to be sure, a singular recontre, for I had not believed it possible that a cloud of this nature could be sustained at so great an elevation. I thought it best, however, to throw out two five-pound pieces of ballast, reserving still a weight of one hundred and sixty-five pounds. Upon so doing, I soon rose above the difficulty, and perceived immediately, that I had obtained a great increase in my rate of ascent. In a few seconds after my leaving the cloud, a flash of vivid lightning shot from one end of it to the other, and caused it to kindle up, throughout its vast extent, like a mass of ignited and glowing charcoal. This, it must be remembered, was in the broad light of day. No fancy may picture the sublimity which might have been exhibited by a similar phenomenon taking place amid the darkness of the night. Hell itself might have been found a fitting image. Even as it was, my hair stood on end, while I gazed afar down within the yawning abysses, letting imagination descend, as it were, and stalk about in the strange vaulted halls, and ruddy gulfs, and red ghastly chasms of the hideous and unfathomable fire. I had indeed made a narrow escape. Had the balloon remained a very short while longer within the cloud- that is to say- had not the inconvenience of getting wet, determined me to discharge the ballast, inevitable ruin would have been the consequence. Such perils, although little considered, are perhaps the greatest which must be encountered in balloons. I had by this time, however, attained too great an elevation to be any longer uneasy on this head.\n\n> I was now rising rapidly, and by seven o'clock the barometer indicated an altitude of no less than nine miles and a half. I began to find great difficulty in drawing my breath. My head, too, was excessively painful; and, having felt for some time a moisture about my cheeks, I at length discovered it to be blood, which was oozing quite fast from the drums of my ears. My eyes, also, gave me great uneasiness. Upon passing the hand over them they seemed to have protruded from their sockets in no inconsiderable degree; and all objects in the car, and even the balloon itself, appeared distorted to my vision. These symptoms were more than I had expected, and occasioned me some alarm. At this juncture, very imprudently, and without consideration, I threw out from the car three five-pound pieces of ballast. The accelerated rate of ascent thus obtained, carried me too rapidly, and without sufficient gradation, into a highly rarefied stratum of the atmosphere, and the result had nearly proved fatal to my expedition and to myself. I was suddenly seized with a spasm which lasted for more than five minutes, and even when this, in a measure, ceased, I could catch my breath only at long intervals, and in a gasping manner- bleeding all the while copiously at the nose and ears, and even slightly at the eyes. The pigeons appeared distressed in the extreme, and struggled to escape; while the cat mewed piteously, and, with her tongue hanging out of her mouth, staggered to and fro in the car as if under the influence of poison. I now too late discovered the great rashness of which I had been guilty in discharging the ballast, and my agitation was excessive. I anticipated nothing less than death, and death in a few minutes. The physical suffering I underwent contributed also to render me nearly incapable of making any exertion for the preservation of my life. I had, indeed, little power of reflection left, and the violence of the pain in my head seemed to be greatly on the increase. Thus I found that my senses would shortly give way altogether, and I had already clutched one of the valve ropes with the view of attempting a descent, when the recollection of the trick I had played the three creditors, and the possible consequences to myself, should I return, operated to deter me for the moment. I lay down in the bottom of the car, and endeavored to collect my faculties. In this I so far succeeded as to determine upon the experiment of losing blood. Having no lancet, however, I was constrained to perform the operation in the best manner I was able, and finally succeeded in opening a vein in my right arm, with the blade of my penknife. The blood had hardly commenced flowing when I experienced a sensible relief, and by the time I had lost about half a moderate basin full, most of the worst symptoms had abandoned me entirely. I nevertheless did not think it expedient to attempt getting on my feet immediately; but, having tied up my arm as well as I could, I lay still for about a quarter of an hour. At the end of this time I arose, and found myself freer from absolute pain of any kind than I had been during the last hour and a quarter of my ascension. The difficulty of breathing, however, was diminished in a very slight degree, and I found that it would soon be positively necessary to make use of my condenser. In the meantime, looking toward the cat, who was again snugly stowed away upon my coat, I discovered to my infinite surprise, that she had taken the opportunity of my indisposition to bring into light a litter of three little kittens. This was an addition to the number of passengers on my part altogether unexpected; but I was pleased at the occurrence. It would afford me a chance of bringing to a kind of test the truth of a surmise, which, more than anything else, had influenced me in attempting this ascension. I had imagined that the habitual endurance of the atmospheric pressure at the surface of the earth was the cause, or nearly so, of the pain attending animal existence at a distance above the surface. Should the kittens be found to suffer uneasiness in an equal degree with their mother, I must consider my theory in fault, but a failure to do so I should look upon as a strong confirmation of my idea.\n\n> By eight o'clock I had actually attained an elevation of seventeen miles above the surface of the earth. Thus it seemed to me evident that my rate of ascent was not only on the increase, but that the progression would have been apparent in a slight degree even had I not discharged the ballast which I did. The pains in my head and ears returned, at intervals, with violence, and I still continued to bleed occasionally at the nose; but, upon the whole, I suffered much less than might have been expected. I breathed, however, at every moment, with more and more difficulty, and each inhalation was attended with a troublesome spasmodic action of the chest. I now unpacked the condensing apparatus, and got it ready for immediate use.\n\n> The view of the earth, at this period of my ascension, was beautiful indeed. To the westward, the northward, and the southward, as far as I could see, lay a boundless sheet of apparently unruffled ocean, which every moment gained a deeper and a deeper tint of blue and began already to assume a slight appearance of convexity. At a vast distance to the eastward, although perfectly discernible, extended the islands of Great Britain, the entire Atlantic coasts of France and Spain, with a small portion of the northern part of the continent of Africa. Of individual edifices not a trace could be discovered, and the proudest cities of mankind had utterly faded away from the face of the earth. From the rock of Gibraltar, now dwindled into a dim speck, the dark Mediterranean sea, dotted with shining islands as the heaven is dotted with stars, spread itself out to the eastward as far as my vision extended, until its entire mass of waters seemed at length to tumble headlong over the abyss of the horizon, and I found myself listening on tiptoe for the echoes of the mighty cataract. Overhead, the sky was of a jetty black, and the stars were brilliantly visible.\n\n> The pigeons about this time seeming to undergo much suffering, I determined upon giving them their liberty. I first untied one of them, a beautiful gray-mottled pigeon, and placed him upon the rim of the wicker-work. He appeared extremely uneasy, looking anxiously around him, fluttering his wings, and making a loud cooing noise, but could not be persuaded to trust himself from off the car. I took him up at last, and threw him to about half a dozen yards from the balloon. He made, however, no attempt to descend as I had expected, but struggled with great vehemence to get back, uttering at the same time very shrill and piercing cries. He at length succeeded in regaining his former station on the rim, but had hardly done so when his head dropped upon his breast, and be fell dead within the car. The other one did not prove so unfortunate. To prevent his following the example of his companion, and accomplishing a return, I threw him downward with all my force, and was pleased to find him continue his descent, with great velocity, making use of his wings with ease, and in a perfectly natural manner. In a very short time he was out of sight, and I have no doubt he reached home in safety. Puss, who seemed in a great measure recovered from her illness, now made a hearty meal of the dead bird and then went to sleep with much apparent satisfaction. Her kittens were quite lively, and so far evinced not the slightest sign of any uneasiness whatever.\n\n> At a quarter-past eight, being no longer able to draw breath without the most intolerable pain, I proceeded forthwith to adjust around the car the apparatus belonging to the condenser. This apparatus will require some little explanation, and your Excellencies will please to bear in mind that my object, in the first place, was to surround myself and cat entirely with a barricade against the highly rarefied atmosphere in which I was existing, with the intention of introducing within this barricade, by means of my condenser, a quantity of this same atmosphere sufficiently condensed for the purposes of respiration. With this object in view I had prepared a very strong perfectly air-tight, but flexible gum-elastic bag. In this bag, which was of sufficient dimensions, the entire car was in a manner placed. That is to say, it (the bag) was drawn over the whole bottom of the car, up its sides, and so on, along the outside of the ropes, to the upper rim or hoop where the net-work is attached. Having pulled the bag up in this way, and formed a complete enclosure on all sides, and at botttom, it was now necessary to fasten up its top or mouth, by passing its material over the hoop of the net-work- in other words, between the net-work and the hoop. But if the net-work were separated from the hoop to admit this passage, what was to sustain the car in the meantime? Now the net-work was not permanently fastened to the hoop, but attached by a series of running loops or nooses. I therefore undid only a few of these loops at one time, leaving the car suspended by the remainder. Having thus inserted a portion of the cloth forming the upper part of the bag, I refastened the loops- not to the hoop, for that would have been impossible, since the cloth now intervened- but to a series of large buttons, affixed to the cloth itself, about three feet below the mouth of the bag, the intervals between the buttons having been made to correspond to the intervals between the loops. This done, a few more of the loops were unfastened from the rim, a farther portion of the cloth introduced, and the disengaged loops then connected with their proper buttons. In this way it was possible to insert the whole upper part of the bag between the net-work and the hoop. It is evident that the hoop would now drop down within the car, while the whole weight of the car itself, with all its contents, would be held up merely by the strength of the buttons. This, at first sight, would seem an inadequate dependence; but it was by no means so, for the buttons were not only very strong in themselves, but so close together that a very slight portion of the whole weight was supported by any one of them. Indeed, had the car and contents been three times heavier than they were, I should not have been at all uneasy. I now raised up the hoop again within the covering of gum-elastic, and propped it at nearly its former height by means of three light poles prepared for the occasion. This was done, of course, to keep the bag distended at the top, and to preserve the lower part of the net-work in its proper situation. All that now remained was to fasten up the mouth of the enclosure; and this was readily accomplished by gathering the folds of the material together, and twisting them up very tightly on the inside by means of a kind of stationary tourniquet.\n\n> In the sides of the covering thus adjusted round the car, had been inserted three circular panes of thick but clear glass, through which I could see without difficulty around me in every horizontal direction. In that portion of the cloth forming the bottom, was likewise, a fourth window, of the same kind, and corresponding with a small aperture in the floor of the car itself. This enabled me to see perpendicularly down, but having found it impossible to place any similar contrivance overhead, on account of the peculiar manner of closing up the opening there, and the consequent wrinkles in the cloth, I could expect to see no objects situated directly in my zenith. This, of course, was a matter of little consequence; for had I even been able to place a window at top, the balloon itself would have prevented my making any use of it.\n\n> About a foot below one of the side windows was a circular opening, eight inches in diameter, and fitted with a brass rim adapted in its inner edge to the windings of a screw. In this rim was screwed the large tube of the condenser, the body of the machine being, of course, within the chamber of gum-elastic. Through this tube a quantity of the rare atmosphere circumjacent being drawn by means of a vacuum created in the body of the machine, was thence discharged, in a state of condensation, to mingle with the thin air already in the chamber. This operation being repeated several times, at length filled the chamber with atmosphere proper for all the purposes of respiration. But in so confined a space it would, in a short time, necessarily become foul, and unfit for use from frequent contact with the lungs. It was then ejected by a small valve at the bottom of the car- the dense air readily sinking into the thinner atmosphere below. To avoid the inconvenience of making a total vacuum at any moment within the chamber, this purification was never accomplished all at once, but in a gradual manner- the valve being opened only for a few seconds, then closed again, until one or two strokes from the pump of the condenser had supplied the place of the atmosphere ejected. For the sake of experiment I had put the cat and kittens in a small basket, and suspended it outside the car to a button at the bottom, close by the valve, through which I could feed them at any moment when necessary. I did this at some little risk, and before closing the mouth of the chamber, by reaching under the car with one of the poles before mentioned to which a hook had been attached.\n\n> By the time I had fully completed these arrangements and filled the chamber as explained, it wanted only ten minutes of nine o'clock. During the whole period of my being thus employed, I endured the most terrible distress from difficulty of respiration, and bitterly did I repent the negligence or rather fool-hardiness, of which I had been guilty, of putting off to the last moment a matter of so much importance. But having at length accomplished it, I soon began to reap the benefit of my invention. Once again I breathed with perfect freedom and ease- and indeed why should I not? I was also agreeably surprised to find myself, in a great measure, relieved from the violent pains which had hitherto tormented me. A slight headache, accompanied with a sensation of fulness or distention about the wrists, the ankles, and the throat, was nearly all of which I had now to complain. Thus it seemed evident that a greater part of the uneasiness attending the removal of atmospheric pressure had actually worn off, as I had expected, and that much of the pain endured for the last two hours should have been attributed altogether to the effects of a deficient respiration.\n\n> At twenty minutes before nine o'clock- that is to say, a short time prior to my closing up the mouth of the chamber, the mercury attained its limit, or ran down, in the barometer, which, as I mentioned before, was one of an extended construction. It then indicated an altitude on my part of 132,000 feet, or five-and-twenty miles, and I consequently surveyed at that time an extent of the earth's area amounting to no less than the three hundred-and-twentieth part of its entire superficies. At nine o'clock I had again lost sight of land to the eastward, but not before I became aware that the balloon was drifting rapidly to the N. N. W. The convexity of the ocean beneath me was very evident indeed, although my view was often interrupted by the masses of cloud which floated to and fro. I observed now that even the lightest vapors never rose to more than ten miles above the level of the sea.\n\n> At half past nine I tried the experiment of throwing out a handful of feathers through the valve. They did not float as I had expected; but dropped down perpendicularly, like a bullet, en masse, and with the greatest velocity- being out of sight in a very few seconds. I did not at first know what to make of this extraordinary phenomenon; not being able to believe that my rate of ascent had, of a sudden, met with so prodigious an acceleration. But it soon occurred to me that the atmosphere was now far too rare to sustain even the feathers; that they actually fell, as they appeared to do, with great rapidity; and that I had been surprised by the united velocities of their descent and my own elevation.\n\n> By ten o'clock I found that I had very little to occupy my immediate attention. Affairs went swimmingly, and I believed the balloon to be going upward witb a speed increasing momently although I had no longer any means of ascertaining the progression of the increase. I suffered no pain or uneasiness of any kind, and enjoyed better spirits than I had at any period since my departure from Rotterdam, busying myself now in examining the state of my various apparatus, and now in regenerating the atmosphere within the chamber. This latter point I determined to attend to at regular intervals of forty minutes, more on account of the preservation of my health, than from so frequent a renovation being absolutely necessary. In the meanwhile I could not help making anticipations. Fancy revelled in the wild and dreamy regions of the moon. Imagination, feeling herself for once unshackled, roamed at will among the ever-changing wonders of a shadowy and unstable land. Now there were boary and time-honored forests, and craggy precipices, and waterfalls tumbling with a loud noise into abysses without a bottom. Then I came suddenly into still noonday solitudes, where no wind of heaven ever intruded, and where vast meadows of poppies, and slender, lily-looking flowers spread themselves out a weary distance, all silent and motionless forever. Then again I journeyed far down away into another country where it was all one dim and vague lake, with a boundary line of clouds. And out of this melancholy water arose a forest of tall eastern trees, like a wilderness of dreams. And I have in mind that the shadows of the trees which fell upon the lake remained not on the surface where they fell, but sunk slowly and steadily down, and commingled with the waves, while from the trunks of the trees other shadows were continually coming out, and taking the place of their brothers thus entombed. \"This then,\" I said thoughtfully, \"is the very reason why the waters of this lake grow blacker with age, and more melancholy as the hours run on.\" But fancies such as these were not the sole possessors of my brain. Horrors of a nature most stern and most appalling would too frequently obtrude themselves upon my mind, and shake the innermost depths of my soul with the bare supposition of their possibility. Yet I would not suffer my thoughts for any length of time to dwell upon these latter speculations, rightly judging the real and palpable dangers of the voyage sufficient for my undivided attention.\n\n> At five o'clock, p.m., being engaged in regenerating the atmosphere within the chamber, I took that opportunity of observing the cat and kittens through the valve. The cat herself appeared to suffer again very much, and I had no hesitation in attributing her uneasiness chiefly to a difficulty in breathing; but my experiment with the kittens had resulted very strangely. I had expected, of course, to see them betray a sense of pain, although in a less degree than their mother, and this would have been sufficient to confirm my opinion concerning the habitual endurance of atmospheric pressure. But I was not prepared to find them, upon close examination, evidently enjoying a high degree of health, breathing with the greatest ease and perfect regularity, and evincing not the slightest sign of any uneasiness whatever. I could only account for all this by extending my theory, and supposing that the highly rarefied atmosphere around might perhaps not be, as I had taken for granted, chemically insufficient for the purposes of life, and that a person born in such a medium might, possibly, be unaware of any inconvenience attending its inhalation, while, upon removal to the denser strata near the earth, he might endure tortures of a similar nature to those I had so lately experienced. It has since been to me a matter of deep regret that an awkward accident, at this time, occasioned me the loss of my little family of cats, and deprived me of the insight into this matter which a continued experiment might have afforded. In passing my hand through the valve, with a cup of water for the old puss, the sleeves of my shirt became entangled in the loop which sustained the basket, and thus, in a moment, loosened it from the bottom. Had the whole actually vanished into air, it could not have shot from my sight in a more abrupt and instantaneous manner. Positively, there could not have intervened the tenth part of a second between the disengagement of the basket and its absolute and total disappearance with all that it contained. My good wishes followed it to the earth, but of course, I had no hope that either cat or kittens would ever live to tell the tale of their misfortune.\n\n> At six o'clock, I perceived a great portion of the earth's visible area to the eastward involved in thick shadow, which continued to advance with great rapidity, until, at five minutes before seven, the whole surface in view was enveloped in the darkness of night. It was not, however, until long after this time that the rays of the setting sun ceased to illumine the balloon; and this circumstance, although of course fully anticipated, did not fail to give me an infinite deal of pleasure. It was evident that, in the morning, I should behold the rising luminary many hours at least before the citizens of Rotterdam, in spite of their situation so much farther to the eastward, and thus, day after day, in proportion to the height ascended, would I enjoy the light of the sun for a longer and a longer period. I now determined to keep a journal of my passage, reckoning the days from one to twenty-four hours continuously, without taking into consideration the intervals of darkness.\n\n> At ten o'clock, feeling sleepy, I determined to lie down for the rest of the night; but here a difficulty presented itself, which, obvious as it may appear, had escaped my attention up to the very moment of which I am now speaking. If I went to sleep as I proposed, how could the atmosphere in the chamber be regenerated in the interim? To breathe it for more than an hour, at the farthest, would be a matter of impossibility, or, if even this term could be extended to an hour and a quarter, the most ruinous consequences might ensue. The consideration of this dilemma gave me no little disquietude; and it will hardly be believed, that, after the dangers I had undergone, I should look upon this business in so serious a light, as to give up all hope of accomplishing my ultimate design, and finally make up my mind to the necessity of a descent. But this hesitation was only momentary. I reflected that man is the veriest slave of custom, and that many points in the routine of his existence are deemed essentially important, which are only so at all by his having rendered them habitual. It was very certain that I could not do without sleep; but I might easily bring myself to feel no inconvenience from being awakened at intervals of an hour during the whole period of my repose. It would require but five minutes at most to regenerate the atmosphere in the fullest manner, and the only real difficulty was to contrive a method of arousing myself at the proper moment for so doing. But this was a question which, I am willing to confess, occasioned me no little trouble in its solution. To be sure, I had heard of the student who, to prevent his falling asleep over his books, held in one hand a ball of copper, the din of whose descent into a basin of the same metal on the floor beside his chair, served effectually to startle him up, if, at any moment, he should be overcome with drowsiness. My own case, however, was very different indeed, and left me no room for any similar idea; for I did not wish to keep awake, but to be aroused from slumber at regular intervals of time. I at length hit upon the following expedient, which, simple as it may seem, was hailed by me, at the moment of discovery, as an invention fully equal to that of the telescope, the steam-engine, or the art of printing itself.\n\n> It is necessary to premise, that the balloon, at the elevation now attained, continued its course upward with an even and undeviating ascent, and the car consequently followed with a steadiness so perfect that it would have been impossible to detect in it the slightest vacillation whatever. This circumstance favored me greatly in the project I now determined to adopt. My supply of water had been put on board in kegs containing five gallons each, and ranged very securely around the interior of the car. I unfastened one of these, and taking two ropes tied them tightly across the rim of the wicker-work from one side to the other; placing them about a foot apart and parallel so as to form a kind of shelf, upon which I placed the keg, and steadied it in a horizontal position. About eight inches immediately below these ropes, and four feet from the bottom of the car I fastened another shelf- but made of thin plank, being the only similar piece of wood I had. Upon this latter shelf, and exactly beneath one of the rims of the keg, a small earthern pitcher was deposited. I now bored a hole in the end of the keg over the pitcher, and fitted in a plug of soft wood, cut in a tapering or conical shape. This plug I pushed in or pulled out, as might happen, until, after a few experiments, it arrived at that exact degree of tightness, at which the water, oozing from the hole, and falling into the pitcher below, would fill the latter to the brim in the period of sixty minutes. This, of course, was a matter briefly and easily ascertained, by noticing the proportion of the pitcher filled in any given time. Having arranged all this, the rest of the plan is obvious. My bed was so contrived upon the floor of the car, as to bring my head, in lying down, immediately below the mouth of the pitcher. It was evident, that, at the expiration of an hour, the pitcher, getting full, would be forced to run over, and to run over at the mouth, which was somewhat lower than the rim. It was also evident, that the water thus falling from a height of more than four feet, could not do otherwise than fall upon my face, and that the sure consequences would be, to waken me up instantaneously, even from the soundest slumber in the world.\n\n> It was fully eleven by the time I had completed these arrangements, and I immediately betook myself to bed, with full confidence in the efficiency of my invention. Nor in this matter was I disappointed. Punctually every sixty minutes was I aroused by my trusty chronometer, when, having emptied the pitcher into the bung-hole of the keg, and performed the duties of the condenser, I retired again to bed. These regular interruptions to my slumber caused me even less discomfort than I had anticipated; and when I finally arose for the day, it was seven o'clock, and the sun had attained many degrees above the line of my horizon.\n\n> April 3d. I found the balloon at an immense height indeed, and the earth's apparent convexity increased in a material degree. Below me in the ocean lay a cluster of black specks, which undoubtedly were islands. Far away to the northward I perceived a thin, white, and exceedingly brilliant line, or streak, on the edge of the horizon, and I had no hesitation in supposing it to be the southern disk of the ices of the Polar Sea. My curiosity was greatly excited, for I had hopes of passing on much farther to the north, and might possibly, at some period, find myself placed directly above the Pole itself. I now lamented that my great elevation would, in this case, prevent my taking as accurate a survey as I could wish. Much, however, might be ascertained. Nothing else of an extraordinary nature occurred during the day. My apparatus all continued in good order, and the balloon still ascended without any perceptible vacillation. The cold was intense, and obliged me to wrap up closely in an overcoat. When darkness came over the earth, I betook myself to bed, although it was for many hours afterward broad daylight all around my immediate situation. The water-clock was punctual in its duty, and I slept until next morning soundly, with the exception of the periodical interruption.\n\n> April 4th. Arose in good health and spirits, and was astonished at the singular change which had taken place in the appearance of the sea. It had lost, in a great measure, the deep tint of blue it had hitherto worn, being now of a grayish-white, and of a lustre dazzling to the eye. The islands were no longer visible; whether they had passed down the horizon to the southeast, or whether my increasing elevation had left them out of sight, it is impossible to say. I was inclined, however, to the latter opinion. The rim of ice to the northward was growing more and more apparent. Cold by no means so intense. Nothing of importance occurred, and I passed the day in reading, having taken care to supply myself with books.\n\n> April 5th. Beheld the singular phenomenon of the sun rising while nearly the whole visible surface of the earth continued to be involved in darkness. In time, however, the light spread itself over all, and I again saw the line of ice to the northward. It was now very distinct, and appeared of a much darker hue than the waters of the ocean. I was evidently approaching it, and with great rapidity. Fancied I could again distinguish a strip of land to the eastward, and one also to the westward, but could not be certain. Weather moderate. Nothing of any consequence happened during the day. Went early to bed.\n\n> April 6th. Was surprised at finding the rim of ice at a very moderate distance, and an immense field of the same material stretching away off to the horizon in the north. It was evident that if the balloon held its present course, it would soon arrive above the Frozen Ocean, and I had now little doubt of ultimately seeing the Pole. During the whole of the day I continued to near the ice. Toward night the limits of my horizon very suddenly and materially increased, owing undoubtedly to the earth's form being that of an oblate spheroid, and my arriving above the flattened regions in the vicinity of the Arctic circle. When darkness at length overtook me, I went to bed in great anxiety, fearing to pass over the object of so much curiosity when I should have no opportunity of observing it.\n\n> April 7th. Arose early, and, to my great joy, at length beheld what there could be no hesitation in supposing the northern Pole itself. It was there, beyond a doubt, and immediately beneath my feet; but, alas! I had now ascended to so vast a distance, that nothing could with accuracy be discerned. Indeed, to judge from the progression of the numbers indicating my various altitudes, respectively, at different periods, between six A.M. on the second of April, and twenty minutes before nine A.M. of the same day (at which time the barometer ran down), it might be fairly inferred that the balloon had now, at four o'clock in the morning of April the seventh, reached a height of not less, certainly, than 7,254 miles above the surface of the sea. This elevation may appear immense, but the estimate upon which it is calculated gave a result in all probability far inferior to the truth. At all events I undoubtedly beheld the whole of the earth's major diameter; the entire northern hemisphere lay beneath me like a chart orthographically projected: and the great circle of the equator itself formed the boundary line of my horizon. Your Excellencies may, however, readily imagine that the confined regions hitherto unexplored within the limits of the Arctic circle, although situated directly beneath me, and therefore seen without any appearance of being foreshortened, were still, in themselves, comparatively too diminutive, and at too great a distance from the point of sight, to admit of any very accurate examination. Nevertheless, what could be seen was of a nature singular and exciting. Northwardly from that huge rim before mentioned, and which, with slight qualification, may be called the limit of human discovery in these regions, one unbroken, or nearly unbroken, sheet of ice continues to extend. In the first few degrees of this its progress, its surface is very sensibly flattened, farther on depressed into a plane, and finally, becoming not a little concave, it terminates, at the Pole itself, in a circular centre, sharply defined, wbose apparent diameter subtended at the balloon an angle of about sixty-five seconds, and whose dusky hue, varying in intensity, was, at all times, darker than any other spot upon the visible hemisphere, and occasionally deepened into the most absolute and impenetrable blackness. Farther than this, little could be ascertained. By twelve o'clock the circular centre had materially decreased in circumference, and by seven P.M. I lost sight of it entirely; the balloon passing over the western limb of the ice, and floating away rapidly in the direction of the equator.\n\n> April 8th. Found a sensible diminution in the earth's apparent diameter, besides a material alteration in its general color and appearance. The whole visible area partook in different degrees of a tint of pale yellow, and in some portions had acquired a brilliancy even painful to the eye. My view downward was also considerably impeded by the dense atmosphere in the vicinity of the surface being loaded with clouds, between whose masses I could only now and then obtain a glimpse of the earth itself. This difficulty of direct vision had troubled me more or less for the last forty-eight hours; but my present enormous elevation brought closer together, as it were, the floating bodies of vapor, and the inconvenience became, of course, more and more palpable in proportion to my ascent. Nevertheless, I could easily perceive that the balloon now hovered above the range of great lakes in the continent of North America, and was holding a course, due south, which would bring me to the tropics. This circumstance did not fail to give me the most heartful satisfaction, and I hailed it as a happy omen of ultimate success. Indeed, the direction I had hitherto taken, had filled me with uneasiness; for it was evident that, had I continued it much longer, there would have been no possibility of my arriving at the moon at all, whose orbit is inclined to the ecliptic at only the small angle of 5 degrees 8' 48\".\n\n> April 9th. To-day the earth's diameter was greatly diminished, and the color of the surface assumed hourly a deeper tint of yellow. The balloon kept steadily on her course to the southward, and arrived, at nine P.M., over the northern edge of the Mexican Gulf.\n\n> April 10th. I was suddenly aroused from slumber, about five o'clock this morning, by a loud, crackling, and terrific sound, for which I could in no manner account. It was of very brief duration, but, while it lasted resembled nothing in the world of which I had any previous experience. It is needless to say that I became excessively alarmed, having, in the first instance, attributed the noise to the bursting of the balloon. I examined all my apparatus, however, with great attention, and could discover nothing out of order. Spent a great part of the day in meditating upon an occurrence so extraordinary, but could find no means whatever of accounting for it. Went to bed dissatisfied, and in a state of great anxiety and agitation.\n\n> April 11th. Found a startling diminution in the apparent diameter of the earth, and a considerable increase, now observable for the first time, in that of the moon itself, which wanted only a few days of being full. It now required long and excessive labor to condense within the chamber sufficient atmospheric air for the sustenance of life.\n\n> April 12th. A singular alteration took place in regard to the direction of the balloon, and although fully anticipated, afforded me the most unequivocal delight. Having reached, in its former course, about the twentieth parallel of southern latitude, it turned off suddenly, at an acute angle, to the eastward, and thus proceeded throughout the day, keeping nearly, if not altogether, in the exact plane of the lunar ellipse. What was worthy of remark, a very perceptible vacillation in the car was a consequence of this change of route- a vacillation which prevailed, in a more or less degree, for a period of many hours.\n\n> April 13th. Was again very much alarmed by a repetition of the loud, crackling noise which terrified me on the tenth. Thought long upon the subject, but was unable to form any satisfactory conclusion. Great decrease in the earth's apparent diameter, which now subtended from the balloon an angle of very little more than twenty-five degrees. The moon could not be seen at all, being nearly in my zenith. I still continued in the plane of the ellipse, but made little progress to the eastward.\n\n> April 14th. Extremely rapid decrease in the diameter of the earth. To-day I became strongly impressed with the idea, that the balloon was now actually running up the line of apsides to the point of perigee- in other words, holding the direct course which would bring it immediately to the moon in that part of its orbit the nearest to the earth. The moon itself was directly overhead, and consequently hidden from my view. Great and long-continued labor necessary for the condensation of the atmosphere.\n\n> April 15th. Not even the outlines of continents and seas could now be traced upon the earth with anything approaching distinctness. About twelve o'clock I became aware, for the third time, of that appalling sound which had so astonished me before. It now, however, continued for some moments, and gathered intensity as it continued. At length, while, stupefied and terror-stricken, I stood in expectation of I knew not what hideous destruction, the car vibrated with excessive violence, and a gigantic and flaming mass of some material which I could not distinguish, came with a voice of a thousand thunders, roaring and booming by the balloon. When my fears and astonishment had in some degree subsided, I had little difficulty in supposing it to be some mighty volcanic fragment ejected from that world to which I was so rapidly approaching, and, in all probability, one of that singular class of substances occasionally picked up on the earth, and termed meteoric stones for want of a better appellation.\n\n> April 16th. To-day, looking upward as well as I could, through each of the side windows alternately, I beheld, to my great delight, a very small portion of the moon's disk protruding, as it were, on all sides beyond the huge circumference of the balloon. My agitation was extreme; for I had now little doubt of soon reaching the end of my perilous voyage. Indeed, the labor now required by the condenser had increased to a most oppressive degree, and allowed me scarcely any respite from exertion. Sleep was a matter nearly out of the question. I became quite ill, and my frame trembled with exhaustion. It was impossible that human nature could endure this state of intense suffering much longer. During the now brief interval of darkness a meteoric stone again passed in my vicinity, and the frequency of these phenomena began to occasion me much apprehension.\n\n> April 17th. This morning proved an epoch in my voyage. It will be remembered that, on the thirteenth, the earth subtended an angular breadth of twenty-five degrees. On the fourteenth this had greatly diminished; on the fifteenth a still more remarkable decrease was observable; and, on retiring on the night of the sixteenth, I had noticed an angle of no more than about seven degrees and fifteen minutes. What, therefore, must have been my amazement, on awakening from a brief and disturbed slumber, on the morning of this day, the seventeenth, at finding the surface beneath me so suddenly and wonderfully augmented in volume, as to subtend no less than thirty-nine degrees in apparent angular diameter! I was thunderstruck! No words can give any adequate idea of the extreme, the absolute horror and astonishment, with which I was seized possessed, and altogether overwhelmed. My knees tottered beneath me- my teeth chattered- my hair started up on end. \"The balloon, then, had actually burst!\" These were the first tumultuous ideas that hurried through my mind: \"The balloon had positively burst!- I was falling- falling with the most impetuous, the most unparalleled velocity! To judge by the immense distance already so quickly passed over, it could not be more than ten minutes, at the farthest, before I should meet the surface of the earth, and be hurled into annihilation!\" But at length reflection came to my relief. I paused; I considered; and I began to doubt. The matter was impossible. I could not in any reason have so rapidly come down. Besides, although I was evidently approaching the surface below me, it was with a speed by no means commensurate with the velocity I had at first so horribly conceived. This consideration served to calm the perturbation of my mind, and I finally succeeded in regarding the phenomenon in its proper point of view. In fact, amazement must have fairly deprived me of my senses, when I could not see the vast difference, in appearance, between the surface below me, and the surface of my mother earth. The latter was indeed over my head, and completely hidden by the balloon, while the moon- the moon itself in all its glory- lay beneath me, and at my feet.\n\n> The stupor and surprise produced in my mind by this extraordinary change in the posture of affairs was perhaps, after all, that part of the adventure least susceptible of explanation. For the bouleversement in itself was not only natural and inevitable, but had been long actually anticipated as a circumstance to be expected whenever I should arrive at that exact point of my voyage where the attraction of the planet should be superseded by the attraction of the satellite- or, more precisely, where the gravitation of the balloon toward the earth should be less powerful than its gravitation toward the moon. To be sure I arose from a sound slumber, with all my senses in confusion, to the contemplation of a very startling phenomenon, and one which, although expected, was not expected at the moment. The revolution itself must, of course, have taken place in an easy and gradual manner, and it is by no means clear that, had I even been awake at the time of the occurrence, I should have been made aware of it by any internal evidence of an inversion- that is to say, by any inconvenience or disarrangement, either about my person or about my apparatus.\n\n> It is almost needless to say that, upon coming to a due sense of my situation, and emerging from the terror which had absorbed every faculty of my soul, my attention was, in the first place, wholly directed to the contemplation of the general physical appearance of the moon. It lay beneath me like a chart- and although I judged it to be still at no inconsiderable distance, the indentures of its surface were defined to my vision with a most striking and altogether unaccountable distinctness. The entire absence of ocean or sea, and indeed of any lake or river, or body of water whatsoever, struck me, at first glance, as the most extraordinary feature in its geological condition. Yet, strange to say, I beheld vast level regions of a character decidedly alluvial, although by far the greater portion of the hemisphere in sight was covered with innumerable volcanic mountains, conical in shape, and having more the appearance of artificial than of natural protuberance. The highest among them does not exceed three and three-quarter miles in perpendicular elevation; but a map of the volcanic districts of the Campi Phlegraei would afford to your Excellencies a better idea of their general surface than any unworthy description I might think proper to attempt. The greater part of them were in a state of evident eruption, and gave me fearfully to understand their fury and their power, by the repeated thunders of the miscalled meteoric stones, which now rushed upward by the balloon with a frequency more and more appalling.\n\n> April 18th. To-day I found an enormous increase in the moon's apparent bulk- and the evidently accelerated velocity of my descent began to fill me with alarm. It will be remembered, that, in the earliest stage of my speculations upon the possibility of a passage to the moon, the existence, in its vicinity, of an atmosphere, dense in proportion to the bulk of the planet, had entered largely into my calculations; this too in spite of many theories to the contrary, and, it may be added, in spite of a general disbelief in the existence of any lunar atmosphere at all. But, in addition to what I have already urged in regard to Encke's comet and the zodiacal light, I had been strengthened in my opinion by certain observations of Mr. Schroeter, of Lilienthal. He observed the moon when two days and a half old, in the evening soon after sunset, before the dark part was visible, and continued to watch it until it became visible. The two cusps appeared tapering in a very sharp faint prolongation, each exhibiting its farthest extremity faintly illuminated by the solar rays, before any part of the dark hemisphere was visible. Soon afterward, the whole dark limb became illuminated. This prolongation of the cusps beyond the semicircle, I thought, must have arisen from the refraction of the sun's rays by the moon's atmosphere. I computed, also, the height of the atmosphere (which could refract light enough into its dark hemisphere to produce a twilight more luminous than the light reflected from the earth when the moon is about 32 degrees from the new) to be 1,356 Paris feet; in this view, I supposed the greatest height capable of refracting the solar ray, to be 5,376 feet. My ideas on this topic had also received confirmation by a passage in the eighty-second volume of the Philosophical Transactions, in which it is stated that at an occultation of Jupiter's satellites, the third disappeared after having been about 1\" or 2\" of time indistinct, and the fourth became indiscernible near the limb.*\n> *Havelius writes that he has several times found, in skies perfectly clear, when even stars of the sixth and seventh magnitude were conspicuous, that, at the same altitude of the moon, at the same elongation from the earth, and with one and the same excellent telescope, the moon and its maculae did not appear equally lucid at all times. From the circumstances of the observation, it is evident that the cause of this phenomenon is not either in our air, in the tube, in the moon, or in the eye of the spectator, but must be looked for in something (an atmosphere?) existing about the moon.\n\n> Cassini frequently observed Saturn, Jupiter, and the fixed stars, when approaching the moon to occultation, to have their circular figure changed into an oval one; and, in other occultations, he found no alteration of figure at all. Hence it might be supposed, that at some times and not at others, there is a dense matter encompassing the moon wherein the rays of the stars are refracted.\n\n> Upon the resistance or, more properly, upon the support of an atmosphere, existing in the state of density imagined, I had, of course, entirely depended for the safety of my ultimate descent. Should I then, after all, prove to have been mistaken, I had in consequence nothing better to expect, as a finale to my adventure, than being dashed into atoms against the rugged surface of the satellite. And, indeed, I had now every reason to be terrified. My distance from the moon was comparatively trifling, while the labor required by the condenser was diminished not at all, and I could discover no indication whatever of a decreasing rarity in the air.\n\n> April 19th. This morning, to my great joy, about nine o'clock, the surface of the moon being frightfully near, and my apprehensions excited to the utmost, the pump of my condenser at length gave evident tokens of an alteration in the atmosphere. By ten, I had reason to believe its density considerably increased. By eleven, very little labor was necessary at the apparatus; and at twelve o'clock, with some hesitation, I ventured to unscrew the tourniquet, when, finding no inconvenience from having done so, I finally threw open the gum-elastic chamber, and unrigged it from around the car. As might have been expected, spasms and violent headache were the immediate consequences of an experiment so precipitate and full of danger. But these and other difficulties attending respiration, as they were by no means so great as to put me in peril of my life, I determined to endure as I best could, in consideration of my leaving them behind me momently in my approach to the denser strata near the moon. This approach, however, was still impetuous in the extreme; and it soon became alarmingly certain that, although I had probably not been deceived in the expectation of an atmosphere dense in proportion to the mass of the satellite, still I had been wrong in supposing this density, even at the surface, at all adequate to the support of the great weight contained in the car of my balloon. Yet this should have been the case, and in an equal degree as at the surface of the earth, the actual gravity of bodies at either planet supposed in the ratio of the atmospheric condensation. That it was not the case, however, my precipitous downfall gave testimony enough; why it was not so, can only be explained by a reference to those possible geological disturbances to which I have formerly alluded. At all events I was now close upon the planet, and coming down with the most terrible impetuosity. I lost not a moment, accordingly, in throwing overboard first my ballast, then my water-kegs, then my condensing apparatus and gum-elastic chamber, and finally every article within the car. But it was all to no purpose. I still fell with horrible rapidity, and was now not more than half a mile from the surface. As a last resource, therefore, having got rid of my coat, hat, and boots, I cut loose from the balloon the car itself, which was of no inconsiderable weight, and thus, clinging with both hands to the net-work, I had barely time to observe that the whole country, as far as the eye could reach, was thickly interspersed with diminutive habitations, ere I tumbled headlong into the very heart of a fantastical-looking city, and into the middle of a vast crowd of ugly little people, who none of them uttered a single syllable, or gave themselves the least trouble to render me assistance, but stood, like a parcel of idiots, grinning in a ludicrous manner, and eyeing me and my balloon askant, with their arms set a-kimbo. I turned from them in contempt, and, gazing upward at the earth so lately left, and left perhaps for ever, beheld it like a huge, dull, copper shield, about two degrees in diameter, fixed immovably in the heavens overhead, and tipped on one of its edges with a crescent border of the most brilliant gold. No traces of land or water could be discovered, and the whole was clouded with variable spots, and belted with tropical and equatorial zones.\n\n> Thus, may it please your Excellencies, after a series of great anxieties, unheard of dangers, and unparalleled escapes, I had, at length, on the nineteenth day of my departure from Rotterdam, arrived in safety at the conclusion of a voyage undoubtedly the most extraordinary, and the most momentous, ever accomplished, undertaken, or conceived by any denizen of earth. But my adventures yet remain to be related. And indeed your Excellencies may well imagine that, after a residence of five years upon a planet not only deeply interesting in its own peculiar character, but rendered doubly so by its intimate connection, in capacity of satellite, with the world inhabited by man, I may have intelligence for the private ear of the States' College of Astronomers of far more importance than the details, however wonderful, of the mere voyage which so happily concluded. This is, in fact, the case. I have much- very much which it would give me the greatest pleasure to communicate. I have much to say of the climate of the planet; of its wonderful alternations of heat and cold, of unmitigated and burning sunshine for one fortnight, and more than polar frigidity for the next; of a constant transfer of moisture, by distillation like that in vacuo, from the point beneath the sun to the point the farthest from it; of a variable zone of running water, of the people themselves; of their manners, customs, and political institutions; of their peculiar physical construction; of their ugliness; of their want of ears, those useless appendages in an atmosphere so peculiarly modified; of their consequent ignorance of the use and properties of speech; of their substitute for speech in a singular method of inter-communication; of the incomprehensible connection between each particular individual in the moon with some particular individual on the earth- a connection analogous with, and depending upon, that of the orbs of the planet and the satellites, and by means of which the lives and destinies of the inhabitants of the one are interwoven with the lives and destinies of the inhabitants of the other; and above all, if it so please your Excellencies- above all, of those dark and hideous mysteries which lie in the outer regions of the moon- regions which, owing to the almost miraculous accordance of the satellite's rotation on its own axis with its sidereal revolution about the earth, have never yet been turned, and, by God's mercy, never shall be turned, to the scrutiny of the telescopes of man. All this, and more- much more- would I most willingly detail. But, to be brief, I must have my reward. I am pining for a return to my family and to my home, and as the price of any farther communication on my part- in consideration of the light which I have it in my power to throw upon many very important branches of physical and metaphysical science- I must solicit, through the influence of your honorable body, a pardon for the crime of which I have been guilty in the death of the creditors upon my departure from Rotterdam. This, then, is the object of the present paper. Its bearer, an inhabitant of the moon, whom I have prevailed upon, and properly instructed, to be my messenger to the earth, will await your Excellencies' pleasure, and return to me with the pardon in question, if it can, in any manner, be obtained.\n\n> I have the honor to be, etc., your Excellencies' very humble servant,\n\n> HANS PHAALL.\n\nUpon finishing the perusal of this very extraordinary document, Professor Rub-a-dub, it is said, dropped his pipe upon the ground in the extremity of his surprise, and Mynheer Superbus Von Underduk having taken off his spectacles, wiped them, and deposited them in his pocket, so far forgot both himself and his dignity, as to turn round three times upon his heel in the quintessence of astonishment and admiration. There was no doubt about the matter- the pardon should be obtained. So at least swore, with a round oath, Professor Rub-a-dub, and so finally thought the illustrious Von Underduk, as he took the arm of his brother in science, and without saying a word, began to make the best of his way home to deliberate upon the measures to be adopted. Having reached the door, however, of the burgomaster's dwelling, the professor ventured to suggest that as the messenger had thought proper to disappear- no doubt frightened to death by the savage appearance of the burghers of Rotterdam- the pardon would be of little use, as no one but a man of the moon would undertake a voyage to so vast a distance. To the truth of this observation the burgomaster assented, and the matter was therefore at an end. Not so, however, rumors and speculations. The letter, having been published, gave rise to a variety of gossip and opinion. Some of the over-wise even made themselves ridiculous by decrying the whole business; as nothing better than a hoax. But hoax, with these sort of people, is, I believe, a general term for all matters above their comprehension. For my part, I cannot conceive upon what data they have founded such an accusation. Let us see what they say:\n\nImprimus. That certain wags in Rotterdam have certain especial antipathies to certain burgomasters and astronomers.\n\nSecondly. That an odd little dwarf and bottle conjurer, both of whose ears, for some misdemeanor, have been cut off close to his head, has been missing for several days from the neighboring city of Bruges.\n\nThirdly. That the newspapers which were stuck all over the little balloon were newspapers of Holland, and therefore could not have been made in the moon. They were dirty papers- very dirty- and Gluck, the printer, would take his Bible oath to their having been printed in Rotterdam.\n\nHe was mistaken- undoubtedly- mistaken.\n\nFourthly, That Hans Phaall himself, the druken villain, and the three very idle gentlemen styled his creditors, were all seen, no longer than two or three days ago, in a tippling house in the suburbs, having just returned, with money in their pockets, from a trip beyond the sea.\n\nDon't believe it- don't believe a word of it.\n\nLastly. That it is an opinion very generally received, or which ought to be generally received, that the College of Astronomers in the city of Rotterdam, as well as other colleges in all other parts of the world,- not to mention colleges and astronomers in general,- are, to say the least of the matter, not a whit better, nor greater, nor wiser than they ought to be.","views":58,"updated":"2022-04-26T13:54:54Z","tags":[],"type":null,"title":"","slug":"the-unparalleled-adventure-of-one-hans-phall","appearance":"norm","language":"","rtl":false,"created":"2022-04-26T13:54:55Z","paid":false},{"id":"6c78hzztz54e1b32","body":"This is a blog post.","views":37,"updated":"2022-04-26T21:26:00Z","tags":[],"type":null,"title":"My SECOND Post","slug":"my-second-post","appearance":"norm","language":"","rtl":false,"created":"2022-04-26T21:26:01Z","paid":false},{"id":"hczkaac7bey3q9i2","body":"This is a test post.

Indeed, phenomena have there occurred of a nature so completely unexpected- so entirely novel- so utterly at variance with preconceived opinions- as to leave no doubt on my mind that long ere this all Europe is in an uproar, all physics in a ferment, all reason and astronomy together by the ears. date), a vast crowd of people, for purposes not specifically mentioned, were assembled in the great square of the Exchange in the well-conditioned city of Rotterdam. The day was warm- unusually so for the season- there was hardly a breath of air stirring; and the multitude were in no bad humor at being now and then besprinkled with friendly showers of momentary duration, that fell from large white masses of cloud which chequered in a fitful manner the blue vault of the firmament. Nevertheless, about noon, a slight but remarkable agitation became apparent in the assembly: the clattering of ten thousand tongues succeeded; and, in an instant afterward, ten thousand faces were upturned toward the heavens, ten thousand pipes descended simultaneously from the corners of ten thousand mouths, and a shout, which could be compared to nothing but the roaring of Niagara, resounded long, loudly, and furiously, through all the environs of Rotterdam.\r\n\r\nThe origin of this hubbub soon became sufficiently evident. From behind the huge bulk of one of those sharply-defined masses of cloud already mentioned, was seen slowly to emerge into an open area of blue space, a queer, heterogeneous, but apparently solid substance, so oddly shaped, so whimsically put together, as not to be in any manner comprehended, and never to be sufficiently admired, by the host of sturdy burghers who stood open-mouthed below. What could it be? In the name of all the vrows and devils in Rotterdam, what could it possibly portend? No one knew, no one could imagine; no one- not even the burgomaster Mynheer Superbus Von Underduk- had the slightest clew by which to unravel the mystery; so, as nothing more reasonable could be done, every one to a man replaced his pipe carefully in the corner of his mouth, and cocking up his right eye towards the phenomenon, puffed, paused, waddled about, and grunted significantly- then waddled back, grunted, paused, and finally- puffed again.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, however, lower and still lower toward the goodly city, came the object of so much curiosity, and the cause of so much smoke. In a very few minutes it arrived near enough to be accurately discerned. It appeared to be- yes! it was undoubtedly a species of balloon; but surely no such balloon had ever been seen in Rotterdam before. For who, let me ask, ever heard of a balloon manufactured entirely of dirty newspapers? No man in Holland certainly; yet here, under the very noses of the people, or rather at some distance above their noses was the identical thing in question, and composed, I have it on the best authority, of the precise material which no one had ever before known to be used for a similar purpose. It was an egregious insult to the good sense of the burghers of Rotterdam. As to the shape of the phenomenon, it was even still more reprehensible. Being little or nothing better than a huge foolscap turned upside down. And this similitude was regarded as by no means lessened when, upon nearer inspection, there was perceived a large tassel depending from its apex, and, around the upper rim or base of the cone, a circle of little instruments, resembling sheep-bells, which kept up a continual tinkling to the tune of Betty Martin. But still worse. Suspended by blue ribbons to the end of this fantastic machine, there hung, by way of car, an enormous drab beaver bat, with a brim superlatively broad, and a hemispherical crown with a black band and a silver buckle. It is, however, somewhat remarkable that many citizens of Rotterdam swore to having seen the same hat repeatedly before; and indeed the whole assembly seemed to regard it with eyes of familiarity; while the vrow Grettel Phaall, upon sight of it, uttered an exclamation of joyful surprise, and declared it to be the identical hat of her good man himself. Now this was a circumstance the more to be observed, as Phaall, with three companions, had actually disappeared from Rotterdam about five years before, in a very sudden and unaccountable manner, and up to the date of this narrative all attempts had failed of obtaining any intelligence concerning them whatsoever. To be sure, some bones which were thought to be human, mixed up with a quantity of odd-looking rubbish, had been lately discovered in a retired situation to the east of Rotterdam, and some people went so far as to imagine that in this spot a foul murder had been committed, and that the sufferers were in all probability Hans Phaall and his associates. But to return.\r\n\r\nThe balloon (for such no doubt it was) had now descended to within a hundred feet of the earth, allowing the crowd below a sufficiently distinct view of the person of its occupant. This was in truth a very droll little somebody. He could not have been more than two feet in height; but this altitude, little as it was, would have been sufficient to destroy his equilibrium, and tilt him over the edge of his tiny car, but for the intervention of a circular rim reaching as high as the breast, and rigged on to the cords of the balloon. The body of the little man was more than proportionately broad, giving to his entire figure a rotundity highly absurd. His feet, of course, could not be seen at all, although a horny substance of suspicious nature was occasionally protruded through a rent in the bottom of the car, or to speak more properly, in the top of the hat. His hands were enormously large. His hair was extremely gray, and collected in a cue behind. His nose was prodigiously long, crooked, and inflammatory; his eyes full, brilliant, and acute; his chin and cheeks, although wrinkled with age, were broad, puffy, and double; but of ears of any kind or character there was not a semblance to be discovered upon any portion of his head. This odd little gentleman was dressed in a loose surtout of sky-blue satin, with tight breeches to match, fastened with silver buckles at the knees. His vest was of some bright yellow material; a white taffety cap was set jauntily on one side of his head; and, to complete his equipment, a blood-red silk handkerchief enveloped his throat, and fell down, in a dainty manner, upon his bosom, in a fantastic bow-knot of super-eminent dimensions.\r\n\r\nHaving descended, as I said before, to about one hundred feet from the surface of the earth, the little old gentleman was suddenly seized with a fit of trepidation, and appeared disinclined to make any nearer approach to terra firma. Throwing out, therefore, a quantity of sand from a canvas bag, which, he lifted with great difficulty, he became stationary in an instant. He then proceeded, in a hurried and agitated manner, to extract from a side-pocket in his surtout a large morocco pocket-book. This he poised suspiciously in his hand, then eyed it with an air of extreme surprise, and was evidently astonished at its weight. He at length opened it, and drawing there from a huge letter sealed with red sealing-wax and tied carefully with red tape, let it fall precisely at the feet of the burgomaster, Superbus Von Underduk. His Excellency stooped to take it up. But the aeronaut, still greatly discomposed, and having apparently no farther business to detain him in Rotterdam, began at this moment to make busy preparations for departure; and it being necessary to discharge a portion of ballast to enable him to reascend, the half dozen bags which he threw out, one after another, without taking the trouble to empty their contents, tumbled, every one of them, most unfortunately upon the back of the burgomaster, and rolled him over and over no less than one-and-twenty times, in the face of every man in Rotterdam. It is not to be supposed, however, that the great Underduk suffered this impertinence on the part of the little old man to pass off with impunity. It is said, on the contrary, that during each and every one of his one-and twenty circumvolutions he emitted no less than one-and-twenty distinct and furious whiffs from his pipe, to which he held fast the whole time with all his might, and to which he intends holding fast until the day of his death.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the balloon arose like a lark, and, soaring far away above the city, at length drifted quietly behind a cloud similar to that from which it had so oddly emerged, and was thus lost forever to the wondering eyes of the good citiezns of Rotterdam. All attention was now directed to the letter, the descent of which, and the consequences attending thereupon, had proved so fatally subversive of both person and personal dignity to his Excellency, the illustrious Burgomaster Mynheer Superbus Von Underduk. That functionary, however, had not failed, during his circumgyratory movements, to bestow a thought upon the important subject of securing the packet in question, which was seen, upon inspection, to have fallen into the most proper hands, being actually addressed to himself and Professor Rub-a-dub, in their official capacities of President and Vice-President of the Rotterdam College of Astronomy. It was accordingly opened by those dignitaries upon the spot, and found to contain the following extraordinary, and indeed very serious, communications.\r\n\r\n> To their Excellencies Von Underduk and Rub-a-dub, President and Vice-President of the States' College of Astronomers, in the city of Rotterdam.\r\n\r\n> Your Excellencies may perhaps be able to remember an humble artizan, by name Hans Phaall, and by occupation a mender of bellows, who, with three others, disappeared from Rotterdam, about five years ago, in a manner which must have been considered by all parties at once sudden, and extremely unaccountable. If, however, it so please your Excellencies, I, the writer of this communication, am the identical Hans Phaall himself. It is well known to most of my fellow citizens, that for the period of forty years I continued to occupy the little square brick building, at the head of the alley called Sauerkraut, in which I resided at the time of my disappearance. My ancestors have also resided therein time out of mind- they, as well as myself, steadily following the respectable and indeed lucrative profession of mending of bellows. For, to speak the truth, until of late years, that the heads of all the people have been set agog with politics, no better business than my own could an honest citizen of Rotterdam either desire or deserve. Credit was good, employment was never wanting, and on all hands there was no lack of either money or good-will. But, as I was saying, we soon began to feel the effects of liberty and long speeches, and radicalism, and all that sort of thing. People who were formerly, the very best customers in the world, had now not a moment of time to think of us at all. They had, so they said, as much as they could do to read about the revolutions, and keep up with the march of intellect and the spirit of the age. If a fire wanted fanning, it could readily be fanned with a newspaper, and as the government grew weaker, I have no doubt that leather and iron acquired durability in proportion, for, in a very short time, there was not a pair of bellows in all Rotterdam that ever stood in need of a stitch or required the assistance of a hammer. This was a state of things not to be endured. I soon grew as poor as a rat, and, having a wife and children to provide for, my burdens at length became intolerable, and I spent hour after hour in reflecting upon the most convenient method of putting an end to my life. Duns, in the meantime, left me little leisure for contemplation. My house was literally besieged from morning till night, so that I began to rave, and foam, and fret like a caged tiger against the bars of his enclosure. There were three fellows in particular who worried me beyond endurance, keeping watch continually about my door, and threatening me with the law. Upon these three I internally vowed the bitterest revenge, if ever I should be so happy as to get them within my clutches; and I believe nothing in the world but the pleasure of this anticipation prevented me from putting my plan of suicide into immediate execution, by blowing my brains out with a blunderbuss. I thought it best, however, to dissemble my wrath, and to treat them with promises and fair words, until, by some good turn of fate, an opportunity of vengeance should be afforded me.\r\n\r\n> One day, having given my creditors the slip, and feeling more than usually dejected, I continued for a long time to wander about the most obscure streets without object whatever, until at length I chanced to stumble against the corner of a bookseller's stall. Seeing a chair close at hand, for the use of customers, I threw myself doggedly into it, and, hardly knowing why, opened the pages of the first volume which came within my reach. It proved to be a small pamphlet treatise on Speculative Astronomy, written either by Professor Encke of Berlin or by a Frenchman of somewhat similar name. I had some little tincture of information on matters of this nature, and soon became more and more absorbed in the contents of the book, reading it actually through twice before I awoke to a recollection of what was passing around me. By this time it began to grow dark, and I directed my steps toward home. But the treatise had made an indelible impression on my mind, and, as I sauntered along the dusky streets, I revolved carefully over in my memory the wild and sometimes unintelligible reasonings of the writer. There are some particular passages which affected my imagination in a powerful and extraordinary manner. The longer I meditated upon these the more intense grew the interest which had been excited within me. The limited nature of my education in general, and more especially my ignorance on subjects connected with natural philosophy, so far from rendering me diffident of my own ability to comprehend what I had read, or inducing me to mistrust the many vague notions which had arisen in consequence, merely served as a farther stimulus to imagination; and I was vain enough, or perhaps reasonable enough, to doubt whether those crude ideas which, arising in ill-regulated minds, have all the appearance, may not often in effect possess all the force, the reality, and other inherent properties, of instinct or intuition; whether, to proceed a step farther, profundity itself might not, in matters of a purely speculative nature, be detected as a legitimate source of falsity and error. In other words, I believed, and still do believe, that truth, is frequently of its own essence, superficial, and that, in many cases, the depth lies more in the abysses where we seek her, than in the actual situations wherein she may be found. Nature herself seemed to afford me corroboration of these ideas. In the contemplation of the heavenly bodies it struck me forcibly that I could not distinguish a star with nearly as much precision, when I gazed on it with earnest, direct and undeviating attention, as when I suffered my eye only to glance in its vicinity alone. I was not, of course, at that time aware that this apparent paradox was occasioned by the center of the visual area being less susceptible of feeble impressions of light than the exterior portions of the retina. This knowledge, and some of another kind, came afterwards in the course of an eventful five years, during which I have dropped the prejudices of my former humble situation in life, and forgotten the bellows-mender in far different occupations. But at the epoch of which I speak, the analogy which a casual observation of a star offered to the conclusions I had already drawn, struck me with the force of positive conformation, and I then finally made up my mind to the course which I afterwards pursued.\r\n\r\n> It was late when I reached home, and I went immediately to bed. My mind, however, was too much occupied to sleep, and I lay the whole night buried in meditation. Arising early in the morning, and contriving again to escape the vigilance of my creditors, I repaired eagerly to the bookseller's stall, and laid out what little ready money I possessed, in the purchase of some volumes of Mechanics and Practical Astronomy. Having arrived at home safely with these, I devoted every spare moment to their perusal, and soon made such proficiency in studies of this nature as I thought sufficient for the execution of my plan. In the intervals of this period, I made every endeavor to conciliate the three creditors who had given me so much annoyance. In this I finally succeeded- partly by selling enough of my household furniture to satisfy a moiety of their claim, and partly by a promise of paying the balance upon completion of a little project which I told them I had in view, and for assistance in which I solicited their services. By these means- for they were ignorant men- I found little difficulty in gaining them over to my purpose.\r\n\r\n> Matters being thus arranged, I contrived, by the aid of my wife and with the greatest secrecy and caution, to dispose of what property I had remaining, and to borrow, in small sums, under various pretences, and without paying any attention to my future means of repayment, no inconsiderable quantity of ready money. With the means thus accruing I proceeded to procure at intervals, cambric muslin, very fine, in pieces of twelve yards each; twine; a lot of the varnish of caoutchouc; a large and deep basket of wicker-work, made to order; and several other articles necessary in the construction and equipment of a balloon of extraordinary dimensions. This I directed my wife to make up as soon as possible, and gave her all requisite information as to the particular method of proceeding. In the meantime I worked up the twine into a net-work of sufficient dimensions; rigged it with a hoop and the necessary cords; bought a quadrant, a compass, a spy-glass, a common barometer with some important modifications, and two astronomical instruments not so generally known. I then took opportunities of conveying by night, to a retired situation east of Rotterdam, five iron-bound casks, to contain about fifty gallons each, and one of a larger size; six tinned ware tubes, three inches in diameter, properly shaped, and ten feet in length; a quantity of a particular metallic substance, or semi-metal, which I shall not name, and a dozen demijohns of a very common acid. The gas to be formed from these latter materials is a gas never yet generated by any other person than myself- or at least never applied to any similar purpose. The secret I would make no difficulty in disclosing, but that it of right belongs to a citizen of Nantz, in France, by whom it was conditionally communicated to myself. The same individual submitted to me, without being at all aware of my intentions, a method of constructing balloons from the membrane of a certain animal, through which substance any escape of gas was nearly an impossibility. I found it, however, altogether too expensive, and was not sure, upon the whole, whether cambric muslin with a coating of gum caoutchouc, was not equally as good. I mention this circumstance, because I think it probable that hereafter the individual in question may attempt a balloon ascension with the novel gas and material I have spoken of, and I do not wish to deprive him of the honor of a very singular invention.\r\n\r\n> On the spot which I intended each of the smaller casks to occupy respectively during the inflation of the balloon, I privately dug a hole two feet deep; the holes forming in this manner a circle twenty-five feet in diameter. In the centre of this circle, being the station designed for the large cask, I also dug a hole three feet in depth. In each of the five smaller holes, I deposited a canister containing fifty pounds, and in the larger one a keg holding one hundred and fifty pounds, of cannon powder. These- the keg and canisters- I connected in a proper manner with covered trains; and having let into one of the canisters the end of about four feet of slow match, I covered up the hole, and placed the cask over it, leaving the other end of the match protruding about an inch, and barely visible beyond the cask. I then filled up the remaining holes, and placed the barrels over them in their destined situation.\r\n\r\n> Besides the articles above enumerated, I conveyed to the depot, and there secreted, one of M. Grimm's improvements upon the apparatus for condensation of the atmospheric air. I found this machine, however, to require considerable alteration before it could be adapted to the purposes to which I intended making it applicable. But, with severe labor and unremitting perseverance, I at length met with entire success in all my preparations. My balloon was soon completed. It would contain more than forty thousand cubic feet of gas; would take me up easily, I calculated, with all my implements, and, if I managed rightly, with one hundred and seventy-five pounds of ballast into the bargain. It had received three coats of varnish, and I found the cambric muslin to answer all the purposes of silk itself, quite as strong and a good deal less expensive.\r\n\r\n> Everything being now ready, I exacted from my wife an oath of secrecy in relation to all my actions from the day of my first visit to the bookseller's stall; and promising, on my part, to return as soon as circumstances would permit, I gave her what little money I had left, and bade her farewell. Indeed I had no fear on her account. She was what people call a notable woman, and could manage matters in the world without my assistance. I believe, to tell the truth, she always looked upon me as an idle boy, a mere make-weight, good for nothing but building castles in the air, and was rather glad to get rid of me. It was a dark night when I bade her good-bye, and taking with me, as aides-de-camp, the three creditors who had given me so much trouble, we carried the balloon, with the car and accoutrements, by a roundabout way, to the station where the other articles were deposited. We there found them all unmolested, and I proceeded immediately to business.\r\n\r\n> It was the first of April. The night, as I said before, was dark; there was not a star to be seen; and a drizzling rain, falling at intervals, rendered us very uncomfortable. But my chief anxiety was concerning the balloon, which, in spite of the varnish with which it was defended, began to grow rather heavy with the moisture; the powder also was liable to damage. I therefore kept my three duns working with great diligence, pounding down ice around the central cask, and stirring the acid in the others. They did not cease, however, importuning me with questions as to what I intended to do with all this apparatus, and expressed much dissatisfaction at the terrible labor I made them undergo. They could not perceive, so they said, what good was likely to result from their getting wet to the skin, merely to take a part in such horrible incantations. I began to get uneasy, and worked away with all my might, for I verily believe the idiots supposed that I had entered into a compact with the devil, and that, in short, what I was now doing was nothing better than it should be. I was, therefore, in great fear of their leaving me altogether. I contrived, however, to pacify them by promises of payment of all scores in full, as soon as I could bring the present business to a termination. To these speeches they gave, of course, their own interpretation; fancying, no doubt, that at all events I should come into possession of vast quantities of ready money; and provided I paid them all I owed, and a trifle more, in consideration of their services, I dare say they cared very little what became of either my soul or my carcass.\r\n\r\n> In about four hours and a half I found the balloon sufficiently inflated. I attached the car, therefore, and put all my implements in it- not forgetting the condensing apparatus, a copious supply of water, and a large quantity of provisions, such as pemmican, in which much nutriment is contained in comparatively little bulk. I also secured in the car a pair of pigeons and a cat. It was now nearly daybreak, and I thought it high time to take my departure. Dropping a lighted cigar on the ground, as if by accident, I took the opportunity, in stooping to pick it up, of igniting privately the piece of slow match, whose end, as I said before, protruded a very little beyond the lower rim of one of the smaller casks. This manoeuvre was totally unperceived on the part of the three duns; and, jumping into the car, I immediately cut the single cord which held me to the earth, and was pleased to find that I shot upward, carrying with all ease one hundred and seventy-five pounds of leaden ballast, and able to have carried up as many more.\r\n\r\n> Scarcely, however, had I attained the height of fifty yards, when, roaring and rumbling up after me in the most horrible and tumultuous manner, came so dense a hurricane of fire, and smoke, and sulphur, and legs and arms, and gravel, and burning wood, and blazing metal, that my very heart sunk within me, and I fell down in the bottom of the car, trembling with unmitigated terror. Indeed, I now perceived that I had entirely overdone the business, and that the main consequences of the shock were yet to be experienced. Accordingly, in less than a second, I felt all the blood in my body rushing to my temples, and immediately thereupon, a concussion, which I shall never forget, burst abruptly through the night and seemed to rip the very firmament asunder. When I afterward had time for reflection, I did not fail to attribute the extreme violence of the explosion, as regarded myself, to its proper cause- my situation directly above it, and in the line of its greatest power. But at the time, I thought only of preserving my life. The balloon at first collapsed, then furiously expanded, then whirled round and round with horrible velocity, and finally, reeling and staggering like a drunken man, hurled me with great force over the rim of the car, and left me dangling, at a terrific height, with my head downward, and my face outwards, by a piece of slender cord about three feet in length, which hung accidentally through a crevice near the bottom of the wicker-work, and in which, as I fell, my left foot became most providentially entangled. It is impossible- utterly impossible- to form any adequate idea of the horror of my situation. I gasped convulsively for breath- a shudder resembling a fit of the ague agitated every nerve and muscle of my frame- I felt my eyes starting from their sockets- a horrible nausea overwhelmed me- and at length I fainted away.\r\n\r\n> How long I remained in this state it is impossible to say. It must, however, have been no inconsiderable time, for when I partially recovered the sense of existence, I found the day breaking, the balloon at a prodigious height over a wilderness of ocean, and not a trace of land to be discovered far and wide within the limits of the vast horizon. My sensations, however, upon thus recovering, were by no means so rife with agony as might have been anticipated. Indeed, there was much of incipient madness in the calm survey which I began to take of my situation. I drew up to my eyes each of my hands, one after the other, and wondered what occurrence could have given rise to the swelling of the veins, and the horrible blackness of the fingemails. I afterward carefully examined my head, shaking it repeatedly, and feeling it with minute attention, until I succeeded in satisfying myself that it was not, as I had more than half suspected, larger than my balloon. Then, in a knowing manner, I felt in both my breeches pockets, and, missing therefrom a set of tablets and a toothpick case, endeavored to account for their disappearance, and not being able to do so, felt inexpressibly chagrined. It now occurred to me that I suffered great uneasiness in the joint of my left ankle, and a dim consciousness of my situation began to glimmer through my mind. But, strange to say! I was neither astonished nor horror-stricken. If I felt any emotion at all, it was a kind of chuckling satisfaction at the cleverness I was about to display in extricating myself from this dilemma; and I never, for a moment, looked upon my ultimate safety as a question susceptible of doubt. For a few minutes I remained wrapped in the profoundest meditation. I have a distinct recollection of frequently compressing my lips, putting my forefinger to the side of my nose, and making use of other gesticulations and grimaces common to men who, at ease in their arm-chairs, meditate upon matters of intricacy or importance. Having, as I thought, sufficiently collected my ideas, I now, with great caution and deliberation, put my hands behind my back, and unfastened the large iron buckle which belonged to the waistband of my inexpressibles. This buckle had three teeth, which, being somewhat rusty, turned with great difficulty on their axis. I brought them, however, after some trouble, at right angles to the body of the buckle, and was glad to find them remain firm in that position. Holding the instrument thus obtained within my teeth, I now proceeded to untie the knot of my cravat. I had to rest several times before I could accomplish this manoeuvre, but it was at length accomplished. To one end of the cravat I then made fast the buckle, and the other end I tied, for greater security, tightly around my wrist. Drawing now my body upwards, with a prodigious exertion of muscular force, I succeeded, at the very first trial, in throwing the buckle over the car, and entangling it, as I had anticipated, in the circular rim of the wicker-work.\r\n\r\n> My body was now inclined towards the side of the car, at an angle of about forty-five degrees; but it must not be understood that I was therefore only forty-five degrees below the perpendicular. So far from it, I still lay nearly level with the plane of the horizon; for the change of situation which I had acquired, had forced the bottom of the car considerably outwards from my position, which was accordingly one of the most imminent and deadly peril. It should be remembered, however, that when I fell in the first instance, from the car, if I had fallen with my face turned toward the balloon, instead of turned outwardly from it, as it actually was; or if, in the second place, the cord by which I was suspended had chanced to hang over the upper edge, instead of through a crevice near the bottom of the car,- I say it may be readily conceived that, in either of these supposed cases, I should have been unable to accomplish even as much as I had now accomplished, and the wonderful adventures of Hans Phaall would have been utterly lost to posterity, I had therefore every reason to be grateful; although, in point of fact, I was still too stupid to be anything at all, and hung for, perhaps, a quarter of an hour in that extraordinary manner, without making the slightest farther exertion whatsoever, and in a singularly tranquil state of idiotic enjoyment. But this feeling did not fail to die rapidly away, and thereunto succeeded horror, and dismay, and a chilling sense of utter helplessness and ruin. In fact, the blood so long accumulating in the vessels of my head and throat, and which had hitherto buoyed up my spirits with madness and delirium, had now begun to retire within their proper channels, and the distinctness which was thus added to my perception of the danger, merely served to deprive me of the self-possession and courage to encounter it. But this weakness was, luckily for me, of no very long duration. In good time came to my rescue the spirit of despair, and, with frantic cries and struggles, I jerked my way bodily upwards, till at length, clutching with a vise-like grip the long-desired rim, I writhed my person over it, and fell headlong and shuddering within the car.\r\n\r\n> It was not until some time afterward that I recovered myself sufficiently to attend to the ordinary cares of the balloon. I then, however, examined it with attention, and found it, to my great relief, uninjured. My implements were all safe, and, fortunately, I had lost neither ballast nor provisions. Indeed, I had so well secured them in their places, that such an accident was entirely out of the question. Looking at my watch, I found it six o'clock. I was still rapidly ascending, and my barometer gave a present altitude of three and three-quarter miles. Immediately beneath me in the ocean, lay a small black object, slightly oblong in shape, seemingly about the size, and in every way bearing a great resemblance to one of those childish toys called a domino. Bringing my telescope to bear upon it, I plainly discerned it to be a British ninety four-gun ship, close-hauled, and pitching heavily in the sea with her head to the W.S.W. Besides this ship, I saw nothing but the ocean and the sky, and the sun, which had long arisen.\r\n\r\n> It is now high time that I should explain to your Excellencies the object of my perilous voyage. Your Excellencies will bear in mind that distressed circumstances in Rotterdam had at length driven me to the resolution of committing suicide. It was not, however, that to life itself I had any, positive disgust, but that I was harassed beyond endurance by the adventitious miseries attending my situation. In this state of mind, wishing to live, yet wearied with life, the treatise at the stall of the bookseller opened a resource to my imagination. I then finally made up my mind. I determined to depart, yet live- to leave the world, yet continue to exist- in short, to drop enigmas, I resolved, let what would ensue, to force a passage, if I could, to the moon. Now, lest I should be supposed more of a madman than I actually am, I will detail, as well as I am able, the considerations which led me to believe that an achievement of this nature, although without doubt difficult, and incontestably full of danger, was not absolutely, to a bold spirit, beyond the confines of the possible.\r\n\r\n> The moon's actual distance from the earth was the first thing to be attended to. Now, the mean or average interval between the centres of the two planets is 59.9643 of the earth's equatorial radii, or only about 237,000 miles. I say the mean or average interval. But it must be borne in mind that the form of the moon's orbit being an ellipse of eccentricity amounting to no less than 0.05484 of the major semi-axis of the ellipse itself, and the earth's centre being situated in its focus, if I could, in any manner, contrive to meet the moon, as it were, in its perigee, the above mentioned distance would be materially diminished. But, to say nothing at present of this possibility, it was very certain that, at all events, from the 237,000 miles I would have to deduct the radius of the earth, say 4,000, and the radius of the moon, say 1080, in all 5,080, leaving an actual interval to be traversed, under average circumstances, of 231,920 miles. Now this, I reflected, was no very extraordinary distance. Travelling on land has been repeatedly accomplished at the rate of thirty miles per hour, and indeed a much greater speed may be anticipated. But even at this velocity, it would take me no more than 322 days to reach the surface of the moon. There were, however, many particulars inducing me to believe that my average rate of travelling might possibly very much exceed that of thirty miles per hour, and, as these considerations did not fail to make a deep impression upon my mind, I will mention them more fully hereafter.\r\n\r\n> The next point to be regarded was a matter of far greater importance. From indications afforded by the barometer, we find that, in ascensions from the surface of the earth we have, at the height of 1,000 feet, left below us about one-thirtieth of the entire mass of atmospheric air, that at 10,600 we have ascended through nearly one-third; and that at 18,000, which is not far from the elevation of Cotopaxi, we have surmounted one-half the material, or, at all events, one-half the ponderable, body of air incumbent upon our globe. It is also calculated that at an altitude not exceeding the hundredth part of the earth's diameter- that is, not exceeding eighty miles- the rarefaction would be so excessive that animal life could in no manner be sustained, and, moreover, that the most delicate means we possess of ascertaining the presence of the atmosphere would be inadequate to assure us of its existence. But I did not fail to perceive that these latter calculations are founded altogether on our experimental knowledge of the properties of air, and the mechanical laws regulating its dilation and compression, in what may be called, comparatively speaking, the immediate vicinity of the earth itself; and, at the same time, it is taken for granted that animal life is and must be essentially incapable of modification at any given unattainable distance from the surface. Now, all such reasoning and from such data must, of course, be simply analogical. The greatest height ever reached by man was that of 25,000 feet, attained in the aeronautic expedition of Messieurs Gay-Lussac and Biot. This is a moderate altitude, even when compared with the eighty miles in question; and I could not help thinking that the subject admitted room for doubt and great latitude for speculation.\r\n\r\n> But, in point of fact, an ascension being made to any given altitude, the ponderable quantity of air surmounted in any farther ascension is by no means in proportion to the additional height ascended (as may be plainly seen from what has been stated before), but in a ratio constantly decreasing. It is therefore evident that, ascend as high as we may, we cannot, literally speaking, arrive at a limit beyond which no atmosphere is to be found. It must exist, I argued; although it may exist in a state of infinite rarefaction.\r\n\r\n> On the other hand, I was aware that arguments have not been wanting to prove the existence of a real and definite limit to the atmosphere, beyond which there is absolutely no air whatsoever. But a circumstance which has been left out of view by those who contend for such a limit seemed to me, although no positive refutation of their creed, still a point worthy very serious investigation. On comparing the intervals between the successive arrivals of Encke's comet at its perihelion, after giving credit, in the most exact manner, for all the disturbances due to the attractions of the planets, it appears that the periods are gradually diminishing; that is to say, the major axis of the comet's ellipse is growing shorter, in a slow but perfectly regular decrease. Now, this is precisely what ought to be the case, if we suppose a resistance experienced from the comet from an extremely rare ethereal medium pervading the regions of its orbit. For it is evident that such a medium must, in retarding the comet's velocity, increase its centripetal, by weakening its centrifugal force. In other words, the sun's attraction would be constantly attaining greater power, and the comet would be drawn nearer at every revolution. Indeed, there is no other way of accounting for the variation in question. But again. The real diameter of the same comet's nebulosity is observed to contract rapidly as it approaches the sun, and dilate with equal rapidity in its departure towards its aphelion. Was I not justifiable in supposing with M. Valz, that this apparent condensation of volume has its origin in the compression of the same ethereal medium I have spoken of before, and which is only denser in proportion to its solar vicinity? The lenticular-shaped phenomenon, also called the zodiacal light, was a matter worthy of attention. This radiance, so apparent in the tropics, and which cannot be mistaken for any meteoric lustre, extends from the horizon obliquely upward, and follows generally the direction of the sun's equator. It appeared to me evidently in the nature of a rare atmosphere extending from the sun outward, beyond the orbit of Venus at least, and I believed indefinitely farther.* Indeed, this medium I could not suppose confined to the path of the comet's ellipse, or to the immediate neighborhood of the sun. It was easy, on the contrary, to imagine it pervading the entire regions of our planetary system, condensed into what we call atmosphere at the planets themselves, and perhaps at some of them modified by considerations, so to speak, purely geological.\r\n> *The zodiacal light is probably what the ancients called Trabes. Emicant Trabes quos docos vocant.- Pliny, lib. 2, p. 26.\r\n\r\n> Having adopted this view of the subject, I had little further hesitation. Granting that on my passage I should meet with atmosphere essentially the same as at the surface of the earth, I conceived that, by means of the very ingenious apparatus of M. Grimm, I should readily be enabled to condense it in sufficient quantity for the purposes of respiration. This would remove the chief obstacle in a journey to the moon. I had indeed spent some money and great labor in adapting the apparatus to the object intended, and confidently looked forward to its successful application, if I could manage to complete the voyage within any reasonable period. This brings me back to the rate at which it might be possible to travel.\r\n\r\n> It is true that balloons, in the first stage of their ascensions from the earth, are known to rise with a velocity comparatively moderate. Now, the power of elevation lies altogether in the superior lightness of the gas in the balloon compared with the atmospheric air; and, at first sight, it does not appear probable that, as the balloon acquires altitude, and consequently arrives successively in atmospheric strata of densities rapidly diminishing- I say, it does not appear at all reasonable that, in this its progress upwards, the original velocity should be accelerated. On the other hand, I was not aware that, in any recorded ascension, a diminution was apparent in the absolute rate of ascent; although such should have been the case, if on account of nothing else, on account of the escape of gas through balloons ill-constructed, and varnished with no better material than the ordinary varnish. It seemed, therefore, that the effect of such escape was only sufficient to counterbalance the effect of some accelerating power. I now considered that, provided in my passage I found the medium I had imagined, and provided that it should prove to be actually and essentially what we denominate atmospheric air, it could make comparatively little difference at what extreme state of rarefaction I should discover it- that is to say, in regard to my power of ascending- for the gas in the balloon would not only be itself subject to rarefaction partially similar (in proportion to the occurrence of which, I could suffer an escape of so much as would be requisite to prevent explosion), but, being what it was, would, at all events, continue specifically lighter than any compound whatever of mere nitrogen and oxygen. In the meantime, the force of gravitation would be constantly diminishing, in proportion to the squares of the distances, and thus, with a velocity prodigiously accelerating, I should at length arrive in those distant regions where the force of the earth's attraction would be superseded by that of the moon. In accordance with these ideas, I did not think it worth while to encumber myself with more provisions than would be sufficient for a period of forty days.\r\n\r\n> There was still, however, another difficulty, which occasioned me some little disquietude. It has been observed, that, in balloon ascensions to any considerable height, besides the pain attending respiration, great uneasiness is experienced about the head and body, often accompanied with bleeding at the nose, and other symptoms of an alarming kind, and growing more and more inconvenient in proportion to the altitude attained.* This was a reflection of a nature somewhat startling. Was it not probable that these symptoms would increase indefinitely, or at least until terminated by death itself? I finally thought not. Their origin was to be looked for in the progressive removal of the customary atmospheric pressure upon the surface of the body, and consequent distention of the superficial blood-vessels- not in any positive disorganization of the animal system, as in the case of difficulty in breathing, where the atmospheric density is chemically insufficient for the due renovation of blood in a ventricle of the heart. Unless for default of this renovation, I could see no reason, therefore, why life could not be sustained even in a vacuum; for the expansion and compression of chest, commonly called breathing, is action purely muscular, and the cause, not the effect, of respiration. In a word, I conceived that, as the body should become habituated to the want of atmospheric pressure, the sensations of pain would gradually diminish- and to endure them while they continued, I relied with confidence upon the iron hardihood of my constitution.\r\n> *Since the original publication of Hans Phaall, I find that Mr. Green, of Nassau balloon notoriety, and other late aeronauts, deny the assertions of Humboldt, in this respect, and speak of a decreasing inconvenience,- precisely in accordance with the theory here urged in a mere spirit of banter.\r\n\r\n> Thus, may it please your Excellencies, I have detailed some, though by no means all, the considerations which led me to form the project of a lunar voyage. I shall now proceed to lay before you the result of an attempt so apparently audacious in conception, and, at all events, so utterly unparalleled in the annals of mankind.\r\n\r\n> Having attained the altitude before mentioned, that is to say three miles and three-quarters, I threw out from the car a quantity of feathers, and found that I still ascended with sufficient rapidity; there was, therefore, no necessity for discharging any ballast. I was glad of this, for I wished to retain with me as much weight as I could carry, for reasons which will be explained in the sequel. I as yet suffered no bodily inconvenience, breathing with great freedom, and feeling no pain whatever in the head. The cat was lying very demurely upon my coat, which I had taken off, and eyeing the pigeons with an air of nonchalance. These latter being tied by the leg, to prevent their escape, were busily employed in picking up some grains of rice scattered for them in the bottom of the car.\r\n\r\n> At twenty minutes past six o'clock, the barometer showed an elevation of 26,400 feet, or five miles to a fraction. The prospect seemed unbounded. Indeed, it is very easily calculated by means of spherical geometry, what a great extent of the earth's area I beheld. The convex surface of any segment of a sphere is, to the entire surface of the sphere itself, as the versed sine of the segment to the diameter of the sphere. Now, in my case, the versed sine- that is to say, the thickness of the segment beneath me- was about equal to my elevation, or the elevation of the point of sight above the surface. \"As five miles, then, to eight thousand,\" would express the proportion of the earth's area seen by me. In other words, I beheld as much as a sixteen-hundredth part of the whole surface of the globe. The sea appeared unruffled as a mirror, although, by means of the spy-glass, I could perceive it to be in a state of violent agitation. The ship was no longer visible, having drifted away, apparently to the eastward. I now began to experience, at intervals, severe pain in the head, especially about the ears- still, however, breathing with tolerable freedom. The cat and pigeons seemed to suffer no inconvenience whatsoever.\r\n\r\n> At twenty minutes before seven, the balloon entered a long series of dense cloud, which put me to great trouble, by damaging my condensing apparatus and wetting me to the skin. This was, to be sure, a singular recontre, for I had not believed it possible that a cloud of this nature could be sustained at so great an elevation. I thought it best, however, to throw out two five-pound pieces of ballast, reserving still a weight of one hundred and sixty-five pounds. Upon so doing, I soon rose above the difficulty, and perceived immediately, that I had obtained a great increase in my rate of ascent. In a few seconds after my leaving the cloud, a flash of vivid lightning shot from one end of it to the other, and caused it to kindle up, throughout its vast extent, like a mass of ignited and glowing charcoal. This, it must be remembered, was in the broad light of day. No fancy may picture the sublimity which might have been exhibited by a similar phenomenon taking place amid the darkness of the night. Hell itself might have been found a fitting image. Even as it was, my hair stood on end, while I gazed afar down within the yawning abysses, letting imagination descend, as it were, and stalk about in the strange vaulted halls, and ruddy gulfs, and red ghastly chasms of the hideous and unfathomable fire. I had indeed made a narrow escape. Had the balloon remained a very short while longer within the cloud- that is to say- had not the inconvenience of getting wet, determined me to discharge the ballast, inevitable ruin would have been the consequence. Such perils, although little considered, are perhaps the greatest which must be encountered in balloons. I had by this time, however, attained too great an elevation to be any longer uneasy on this head.\r\n\r\n> I was now rising rapidly, and by seven o'clock the barometer indicated an altitude of no less than nine miles and a half. I began to find great difficulty in drawing my breath. My head, too, was excessively painful; and, having felt for some time a moisture about my cheeks, I at length discovered it to be blood, which was oozing quite fast from the drums of my ears. My eyes, also, gave me great uneasiness. Upon passing the hand over them they seemed to have protruded from their sockets in no inconsiderable degree; and all objects in the car, and even the balloon itself, appeared distorted to my vision. These symptoms were more than I had expected, and occasioned me some alarm. At this juncture, very imprudently, and without consideration, I threw out from the car three five-pound pieces of ballast. The accelerated rate of ascent thus obtained, carried me too rapidly, and without sufficient gradation, into a highly rarefied stratum of the atmosphere, and the result had nearly proved fatal to my expedition and to myself. I was suddenly seized with a spasm which lasted for more than five minutes, and even when this, in a measure, ceased, I could catch my breath only at long intervals, and in a gasping manner- bleeding all the while copiously at the nose and ears, and even slightly at the eyes. The pigeons appeared distressed in the extreme, and struggled to escape; while the cat mewed piteously, and, with her tongue hanging out of her mouth, staggered to and fro in the car as if under the influence of poison. I now too late discovered the great rashness of which I had been guilty in discharging the ballast, and my agitation was excessive. I anticipated nothing less than death, and death in a few minutes. The physical suffering I underwent contributed also to render me nearly incapable of making any exertion for the preservation of my life. I had, indeed, little power of reflection left, and the violence of the pain in my head seemed to be greatly on the increase. Thus I found that my senses would shortly give way altogether, and I had already clutched one of the valve ropes with the view of attempting a descent, when the recollection of the trick I had played the three creditors, and the possible consequences to myself, should I return, operated to deter me for the moment. I lay down in the bottom of the car, and endeavored to collect my faculties. In this I so far succeeded as to determine upon the experiment of losing blood. Having no lancet, however, I was constrained to perform the operation in the best manner I was able, and finally succeeded in opening a vein in my right arm, with the blade of my penknife. The blood had hardly commenced flowing when I experienced a sensible relief, and by the time I had lost about half a moderate basin full, most of the worst symptoms had abandoned me entirely. I nevertheless did not think it expedient to attempt getting on my feet immediately; but, having tied up my arm as well as I could, I lay still for about a quarter of an hour. At the end of this time I arose, and found myself freer from absolute pain of any kind than I had been during the last hour and a quarter of my ascension. The difficulty of breathing, however, was diminished in a very slight degree, and I found that it would soon be positively necessary to make use of my condenser. In the meantime, looking toward the cat, who was again snugly stowed away upon my coat, I discovered to my infinite surprise, that she had taken the opportunity of my indisposition to bring into light a litter of three little kittens. This was an addition to the number of passengers on my part altogether unexpected; but I was pleased at the occurrence. It would afford me a chance of bringing to a kind of test the truth of a surmise, which, more than anything else, had influenced me in attempting this ascension. I had imagined that the habitual endurance of the atmospheric pressure at the surface of the earth was the cause, or nearly so, of the pain attending animal existence at a distance above the surface. Should the kittens be found to suffer uneasiness in an equal degree with their mother, I must consider my theory in fault, but a failure to do so I should look upon as a strong confirmation of my idea.\r\n\r\n> By eight o'clock I had actually attained an elevation of seventeen miles above the surface of the earth. Thus it seemed to me evident that my rate of ascent was not only on the increase, but that the progression would have been apparent in a slight degree even had I not discharged the ballast which I did. The pains in my head and ears returned, at intervals, with violence, and I still continued to bleed occasionally at the nose; but, upon the whole, I suffered much less than might have been expected. I breathed, however, at every moment, with more and more difficulty, and each inhalation was attended with a troublesome spasmodic action of the chest. I now unpacked the condensing apparatus, and got it ready for immediate use.\r\n\r\n> The view of the earth, at this period of my ascension, was beautiful indeed. To the westward, the northward, and the southward, as far as I could see, lay a boundless sheet of apparently unruffled ocean, which every moment gained a deeper and a deeper tint of blue and began already to assume a slight appearance of convexity. At a vast distance to the eastward, although perfectly discernible, extended the islands of Great Britain, the entire Atlantic coasts of France and Spain, with a small portion of the northern part of the continent of Africa. Of individual edifices not a trace could be discovered, and the proudest cities of mankind had utterly faded away from the face of the earth. From the rock of Gibraltar, now dwindled into a dim speck, the dark Mediterranean sea, dotted with shining islands as the heaven is dotted with stars, spread itself out to the eastward as far as my vision extended, until its entire mass of waters seemed at length to tumble headlong over the abyss of the horizon, and I found myself listening on tiptoe for the echoes of the mighty cataract. Overhead, the sky was of a jetty black, and the stars were brilliantly visible.\r\n\r\n> The pigeons about this time seeming to undergo much suffering, I determined upon giving them their liberty. I first untied one of them, a beautiful gray-mottled pigeon, and placed him upon the rim of the wicker-work. He appeared extremely uneasy, looking anxiously around him, fluttering his wings, and making a loud cooing noise, but could not be persuaded to trust himself from off the car. I took him up at last, and threw him to about half a dozen yards from the balloon. He made, however, no attempt to descend as I had expected, but struggled with great vehemence to get back, uttering at the same time very shrill and piercing cries. He at length succeeded in regaining his former station on the rim, but had hardly done so when his head dropped upon his breast, and be fell dead within the car. The other one did not prove so unfortunate. To prevent his following the example of his companion, and accomplishing a return, I threw him downward with all my force, and was pleased to find him continue his descent, with great velocity, making use of his wings with ease, and in a perfectly natural manner. In a very short time he was out of sight, and I have no doubt he reached home in safety. Puss, who seemed in a great measure recovered from her illness, now made a hearty meal of the dead bird and then went to sleep with much apparent satisfaction. Her kittens were quite lively, and so far evinced not the slightest sign of any uneasiness whatever.\r\n\r\n> At a quarter-past eight, being no longer able to draw breath without the most intolerable pain, I proceeded forthwith to adjust around the car the apparatus belonging to the condenser. This apparatus will require some little explanation, and your Excellencies will please to bear in mind that my object, in the first place, was to surround myself and cat entirely with a barricade against the highly rarefied atmosphere in which I was existing, with the intention of introducing within this barricade, by means of my condenser, a quantity of this same atmosphere sufficiently condensed for the purposes of respiration. With this object in view I had prepared a very strong perfectly air-tight, but flexible gum-elastic bag. In this bag, which was of sufficient dimensions, the entire car was in a manner placed. That is to say, it (the bag) was drawn over the whole bottom of the car, up its sides, and so on, along the outside of the ropes, to the upper rim or hoop where the net-work is attached. Having pulled the bag up in this way, and formed a complete enclosure on all sides, and at botttom, it was now necessary to fasten up its top or mouth, by passing its material over the hoop of the net-work- in other words, between the net-work and the hoop. But if the net-work were separated from the hoop to admit this passage, what was to sustain the car in the meantime? Now the net-work was not permanently fastened to the hoop, but attached by a series of running loops or nooses. I therefore undid only a few of these loops at one time, leaving the car suspended by the remainder. Having thus inserted a portion of the cloth forming the upper part of the bag, I refastened the loops- not to the hoop, for that would have been impossible, since the cloth now intervened- but to a series of large buttons, affixed to the cloth itself, about three feet below the mouth of the bag, the intervals between the buttons having been made to correspond to the intervals between the loops. This done, a few more of the loops were unfastened from the rim, a farther portion of the cloth introduced, and the disengaged loops then connected with their proper buttons. In this way it was possible to insert the whole upper part of the bag between the net-work and the hoop. It is evident that the hoop would now drop down within the car, while the whole weight of the car itself, with all its contents, would be held up merely by the strength of the buttons. This, at first sight, would seem an inadequate dependence; but it was by no means so, for the buttons were not only very strong in themselves, but so close together that a very slight portion of the whole weight was supported by any one of them. Indeed, had the car and contents been three times heavier than they were, I should not have been at all uneasy. I now raised up the hoop again within the covering of gum-elastic, and propped it at nearly its former height by means of three light poles prepared for the occasion. This was done, of course, to keep the bag distended at the top, and to preserve the lower part of the net-work in its proper situation. All that now remained was to fasten up the mouth of the enclosure; and this was readily accomplished by gathering the folds of the material together, and twisting them up very tightly on the inside by means of a kind of stationary tourniquet.\r\n\r\n> In the sides of the covering thus adjusted round the car, had been inserted three circular panes of thick but clear glass, through which I could see without difficulty around me in every horizontal direction. In that portion of the cloth forming the bottom, was likewise, a fourth window, of the same kind, and corresponding with a small aperture in the floor of the car itself. This enabled me to see perpendicularly down, but having found it impossible to place any similar contrivance overhead, on account of the peculiar manner of closing up the opening there, and the consequent wrinkles in the cloth, I could expect to see no objects situated directly in my zenith. This, of course, was a matter of little consequence; for had I even been able to place a window at top, the balloon itself would have prevented my making any use of it.\r\n\r\n> About a foot below one of the side windows was a circular opening, eight inches in diameter, and fitted with a brass rim adapted in its inner edge to the windings of a screw. In this rim was screwed the large tube of the condenser, the body of the machine being, of course, within the chamber of gum-elastic. Through this tube a quantity of the rare atmosphere circumjacent being drawn by means of a vacuum created in the body of the machine, was thence discharged, in a state of condensation, to mingle with the thin air already in the chamber. This operation being repeated several times, at length filled the chamber with atmosphere proper for all the purposes of respiration. But in so confined a space it would, in a short time, necessarily become foul, and unfit for use from frequent contact with the lungs. It was then ejected by a small valve at the bottom of the car- the dense air readily sinking into the thinner atmosphere below. To avoid the inconvenience of making a total vacuum at any moment within the chamber, this purification was never accomplished all at once, but in a gradual manner- the valve being opened only for a few seconds, then closed again, until one or two strokes from the pump of the condenser had supplied the place of the atmosphere ejected. For the sake of experiment I had put the cat and kittens in a small basket, and suspended it outside the car to a button at the bottom, close by the valve, through which I could feed them at any moment when necessary. I did this at some little risk, and before closing the mouth of the chamber, by reaching under the car with one of the poles before mentioned to which a hook had been attached.\r\n\r\n> By the time I had fully completed these arrangements and filled the chamber as explained, it wanted only ten minutes of nine o'clock. During the whole period of my being thus employed, I endured the most terrible distress from difficulty of respiration, and bitterly did I repent the negligence or rather fool-hardiness, of which I had been guilty, of putting off to the last moment a matter of so much importance. But having at length accomplished it, I soon began to reap the benefit of my invention. Once again I breathed with perfect freedom and ease- and indeed why should I not? I was also agreeably surprised to find myself, in a great measure, relieved from the violent pains which had hitherto tormented me. A slight headache, accompanied with a sensation of fulness or distention about the wrists, the ankles, and the throat, was nearly all of which I had now to complain. Thus it seemed evident that a greater part of the uneasiness attending the removal of atmospheric pressure had actually worn off, as I had expected, and that much of the pain endured for the last two hours should have been attributed altogether to the effects of a deficient respiration.\r\n\r\n> At twenty minutes before nine o'clock- that is to say, a short time prior to my closing up the mouth of the chamber, the mercury attained its limit, or ran down, in the barometer, which, as I mentioned before, was one of an extended construction. It then indicated an altitude on my part of 132,000 feet, or five-and-twenty miles, and I consequently surveyed at that time an extent of the earth's area amounting to no less than the three hundred-and-twentieth part of its entire superficies. At nine o'clock I had again lost sight of land to the eastward, but not before I became aware that the balloon was drifting rapidly to the N. N. W. The convexity of the ocean beneath me was very evident indeed, although my view was often interrupted by the masses of cloud which floated to and fro. I observed now that even the lightest vapors never rose to more than ten miles above the level of the sea.\r\n\r\n> At half past nine I tried the experiment of throwing out a handful of feathers through the valve. They did not float as I had expected; but dropped down perpendicularly, like a bullet, en masse, and with the greatest velocity- being out of sight in a very few seconds. I did not at first know what to make of this extraordinary phenomenon; not being able to believe that my rate of ascent had, of a sudden, met with so prodigious an acceleration. But it soon occurred to me that the atmosphere was now far too rare to sustain even the feathers; that they actually fell, as they appeared to do, with great rapidity; and that I had been surprised by the united velocities of their descent and my own elevation.\r\n\r\n> By ten o'clock I found that I had very little to occupy my immediate attention. Affairs went swimmingly, and I believed the balloon to be going upward witb a speed increasing momently although I had no longer any means of ascertaining the progression of the increase. I suffered no pain or uneasiness of any kind, and enjoyed better spirits than I had at any period since my departure from Rotterdam, busying myself now in examining the state of my various apparatus, and now in regenerating the atmosphere within the chamber. This latter point I determined to attend to at regular intervals of forty minutes, more on account of the preservation of my health, than from so frequent a renovation being absolutely necessary. In the meanwhile I could not help making anticipations. Fancy revelled in the wild and dreamy regions of the moon. Imagination, feeling herself for once unshackled, roamed at will among the ever-changing wonders of a shadowy and unstable land. Now there were boary and time-honored forests, and craggy precipices, and waterfalls tumbling with a loud noise into abysses without a bottom. Then I came suddenly into still noonday solitudes, where no wind of heaven ever intruded, and where vast meadows of poppies, and slender, lily-looking flowers spread themselves out a weary distance, all silent and motionless forever. Then again I journeyed far down away into another country where it was all one dim and vague lake, with a boundary line of clouds. And out of this melancholy water arose a forest of tall eastern trees, like a wilderness of dreams. And I have in mind that the shadows of the trees which fell upon the lake remained not on the surface where they fell, but sunk slowly and steadily down, and commingled with the waves, while from the trunks of the trees other shadows were continually coming out, and taking the place of their brothers thus entombed. \"This then,\" I said thoughtfully, \"is the very reason why the waters of this lake grow blacker with age, and more melancholy as the hours run on.\" But fancies such as these were not the sole possessors of my brain. Horrors of a nature most stern and most appalling would too frequently obtrude themselves upon my mind, and shake the innermost depths of my soul with the bare supposition of their possibility. Yet I would not suffer my thoughts for any length of time to dwell upon these latter speculations, rightly judging the real and palpable dangers of the voyage sufficient for my undivided attention.\r\n\r\n> At five o'clock, p.m., being engaged in regenerating the atmosphere within the chamber, I took that opportunity of observing the cat and kittens through the valve. The cat herself appeared to suffer again very much, and I had no hesitation in attributing her uneasiness chiefly to a difficulty in breathing; but my experiment with the kittens had resulted very strangely. I had expected, of course, to see them betray a sense of pain, although in a less degree than their mother, and this would have been sufficient to confirm my opinion concerning the habitual endurance of atmospheric pressure. But I was not prepared to find them, upon close examination, evidently enjoying a high degree of health, breathing with the greatest ease and perfect regularity, and evincing not the slightest sign of any uneasiness whatever. I could only account for all this by extending my theory, and supposing that the highly rarefied atmosphere around might perhaps not be, as I had taken for granted, chemically insufficient for the purposes of life, and that a person born in such a medium might, possibly, be unaware of any inconvenience attending its inhalation, while, upon removal to the denser strata near the earth, he might endure tortures of a similar nature to those I had so lately experienced. It has since been to me a matter of deep regret that an awkward accident, at this time, occasioned me the loss of my little family of cats, and deprived me of the insight into this matter which a continued experiment might have afforded. In passing my hand through the valve, with a cup of water for the old puss, the sleeves of my shirt became entangled in the loop which sustained the basket, and thus, in a moment, loosened it from the bottom. Had the whole actually vanished into air, it could not have shot from my sight in a more abrupt and instantaneous manner. Positively, there could not have intervened the tenth part of a second between the disengagement of the basket and its absolute and total disappearance with all that it contained. My good wishes followed it to the earth, but of course, I had no hope that either cat or kittens would ever live to tell the tale of their misfortune.\r\n\r\n> At six o'clock, I perceived a great portion of the earth's visible area to the eastward involved in thick shadow, which continued to advance with great rapidity, until, at five minutes before seven, the whole surface in view was enveloped in the darkness of night. It was not, however, until long after this time that the rays of the setting sun ceased to illumine the balloon; and this circumstance, although of course fully anticipated, did not fail to give me an infinite deal of pleasure. It was evident that, in the morning, I should behold the rising luminary many hours at least before the citizens of Rotterdam, in spite of their situation so much farther to the eastward, and thus, day after day, in proportion to the height ascended, would I enjoy the light of the sun for a longer and a longer period. I now determined to keep a journal of my passage, reckoning the days from one to twenty-four hours continuously, without taking into consideration the intervals of darkness.\r\n\r\n> At ten o'clock, feeling sleepy, I determined to lie down for the rest of the night; but here a difficulty presented itself, which, obvious as it may appear, had escaped my attention up to the very moment of which I am now speaking. If I went to sleep as I proposed, how could the atmosphere in the chamber be regenerated in the interim? To breathe it for more than an hour, at the farthest, would be a matter of impossibility, or, if even this term could be extended to an hour and a quarter, the most ruinous consequences might ensue. The consideration of this dilemma gave me no little disquietude; and it will hardly be believed, that, after the dangers I had undergone, I should look upon this business in so serious a light, as to give up all hope of accomplishing my ultimate design, and finally make up my mind to the necessity of a descent. But this hesitation was only momentary. I reflected that man is the veriest slave of custom, and that many points in the routine of his existence are deemed essentially important, which are only so at all by his having rendered them habitual. It was very certain that I could not do without sleep; but I might easily bring myself to feel no inconvenience from being awakened at intervals of an hour during the whole period of my repose. It would require but five minutes at most to regenerate the atmosphere in the fullest manner, and the only real difficulty was to contrive a method of arousing myself at the proper moment for so doing. But this was a question which, I am willing to confess, occasioned me no little trouble in its solution. To be sure, I had heard of the student who, to prevent his falling asleep over his books, held in one hand a ball of copper, the din of whose descent into a basin of the same metal on the floor beside his chair, served effectually to startle him up, if, at any moment, he should be overcome with drowsiness. My own case, however, was very different indeed, and left me no room for any similar idea; for I did not wish to keep awake, but to be aroused from slumber at regular intervals of time. I at length hit upon the following expedient, which, simple as it may seem, was hailed by me, at the moment of discovery, as an invention fully equal to that of the telescope, the steam-engine, or the art of printing itself.\r\n\r\n> It is necessary to premise, that the balloon, at the elevation now attained, continued its course upward with an even and undeviating ascent, and the car consequently followed with a steadiness so perfect that it would have been impossible to detect in it the slightest vacillation whatever. This circumstance favored me greatly in the project I now determined to adopt. My supply of water had been put on board in kegs containing five gallons each, and ranged very securely around the interior of the car. I unfastened one of these, and taking two ropes tied them tightly across the rim of the wicker-work from one side to the other; placing them about a foot apart and parallel so as to form a kind of shelf, upon which I placed the keg, and steadied it in a horizontal position. About eight inches immediately below these ropes, and four feet from the bottom of the car I fastened another shelf- but made of thin plank, being the only similar piece of wood I had. Upon this latter shelf, and exactly beneath one of the rims of the keg, a small earthern pitcher was deposited. I now bored a hole in the end of the keg over the pitcher, and fitted in a plug of soft wood, cut in a tapering or conical shape. This plug I pushed in or pulled out, as might happen, until, after a few experiments, it arrived at that exact degree of tightness, at which the water, oozing from the hole, and falling into the pitcher below, would fill the latter to the brim in the period of sixty minutes. This, of course, was a matter briefly and easily ascertained, by noticing the proportion of the pitcher filled in any given time. Having arranged all this, the rest of the plan is obvious. My bed was so contrived upon the floor of the car, as to bring my head, in lying down, immediately below the mouth of the pitcher. It was evident, that, at the expiration of an hour, the pitcher, getting full, would be forced to run over, and to run over at the mouth, which was somewhat lower than the rim. It was also evident, that the water thus falling from a height of more than four feet, could not do otherwise than fall upon my face, and that the sure consequences would be, to waken me up instantaneously, even from the soundest slumber in the world.\r\n\r\n> It was fully eleven by the time I had completed these arrangements, and I immediately betook myself to bed, with full confidence in the efficiency of my invention. Nor in this matter was I disappointed. Punctually every sixty minutes was I aroused by my trusty chronometer, when, having emptied the pitcher into the bung-hole of the keg, and performed the duties of the condenser, I retired again to bed. These regular interruptions to my slumber caused me even less discomfort than I had anticipated; and when I finally arose for the day, it was seven o'clock, and the sun had attained many degrees above the line of my horizon.\r\n\r\n> April 3d. I found the balloon at an immense height indeed, and the earth's apparent convexity increased in a material degree. Below me in the ocean lay a cluster of black specks, which undoubtedly were islands. Far away to the northward I perceived a thin, white, and exceedingly brilliant line, or streak, on the edge of the horizon, and I had no hesitation in supposing it to be the southern disk of the ices of the Polar Sea. My curiosity was greatly excited, for I had hopes of passing on much farther to the north, and might possibly, at some period, find myself placed directly above the Pole itself. I now lamented that my great elevation would, in this case, prevent my taking as accurate a survey as I could wish. Much, however, might be ascertained. Nothing else of an extraordinary nature occurred during the day. My apparatus all continued in good order, and the balloon still ascended without any perceptible vacillation. The cold was intense, and obliged me to wrap up closely in an overcoat. When darkness came over the earth, I betook myself to bed, although it was for many hours afterward broad daylight all around my immediate situation. The water-clock was punctual in its duty, and I slept until next morning soundly, with the exception of the periodical interruption.\r\n\r\n> April 4th. Arose in good health and spirits, and was astonished at the singular change which had taken place in the appearance of the sea. It had lost, in a great measure, the deep tint of blue it had hitherto worn, being now of a grayish-white, and of a lustre dazzling to the eye. The islands were no longer visible; whether they had passed down the horizon to the southeast, or whether my increasing elevation had left them out of sight, it is impossible to say. I was inclined, however, to the latter opinion. The rim of ice to the northward was growing more and more apparent. Cold by no means so intense. Nothing of importance occurred, and I passed the day in reading, having taken care to supply myself with books.\r\n\r\n> April 5th. Beheld the singular phenomenon of the sun rising while nearly the whole visible surface of the earth continued to be involved in darkness. In time, however, the light spread itself over all, and I again saw the line of ice to the northward. It was now very distinct, and appeared of a much darker hue than the waters of the ocean. I was evidently approaching it, and with great rapidity. Fancied I could again distinguish a strip of land to the eastward, and one also to the westward, but could not be certain. Weather moderate. Nothing of any consequence happened during the day. Went early to bed.\r\n\r\n> April 6th. Was surprised at finding the rim of ice at a very moderate distance, and an immense field of the same material stretching away off to the horizon in the north. It was evident that if the balloon held its present course, it would soon arrive above the Frozen Ocean, and I had now little doubt of ultimately seeing the Pole. During the whole of the day I continued to near the ice. Toward night the limits of my horizon very suddenly and materially increased, owing undoubtedly to the earth's form being that of an oblate spheroid, and my arriving above the flattened regions in the vicinity of the Arctic circle. When darkness at length overtook me, I went to bed in great anxiety, fearing to pass over the object of so much curiosity when I should have no opportunity of observing it.\r\n\r\n> April 7th. Arose early, and, to my great joy, at length beheld what there could be no hesitation in supposing the northern Pole itself. It was there, beyond a doubt, and immediately beneath my feet; but, alas! I had now ascended to so vast a distance, that nothing could with accuracy be discerned. Indeed, to judge from the progression of the numbers indicating my various altitudes, respectively, at different periods, between six A.M. on the second of April, and twenty minutes before nine A.M. of the same day (at which time the barometer ran down), it might be fairly inferred that the balloon had now, at four o'clock in the morning of April the seventh, reached a height of not less, certainly, than 7,254 miles above the surface of the sea. This elevation may appear immense, but the estimate upon which it is calculated gave a result in all probability far inferior to the truth. At all events I undoubtedly beheld the whole of the earth's major diameter; the entire northern hemisphere lay beneath me like a chart orthographically projected: and the great circle of the equator itself formed the boundary line of my horizon. Your Excellencies may, however, readily imagine that the confined regions hitherto unexplored within the limits of the Arctic circle, although situated directly beneath me, and therefore seen without any appearance of being foreshortened, were still, in themselves, comparatively too diminutive, and at too great a distance from the point of sight, to admit of any very accurate examination. Nevertheless, what could be seen was of a nature singular and exciting. Northwardly from that huge rim before mentioned, and which, with slight qualification, may be called the limit of human discovery in these regions, one unbroken, or nearly unbroken, sheet of ice continues to extend. In the first few degrees of this its progress, its surface is very sensibly flattened, farther on depressed into a plane, and finally, becoming not a little concave, it terminates, at the Pole itself, in a circular centre, sharply defined, wbose apparent diameter subtended at the balloon an angle of about sixty-five seconds, and whose dusky hue, varying in intensity, was, at all times, darker than any other spot upon the visible hemisphere, and occasionally deepened into the most absolute and impenetrable blackness. Farther than this, little could be ascertained. By twelve o'clock the circular centre had materially decreased in circumference, and by seven P.M. I lost sight of it entirely; the balloon passing over the western limb of the ice, and floating away rapidly in the direction of the equator.\r\n\r\n> April 8th. Found a sensible diminution in the earth's apparent diameter, besides a material alteration in its general color and appearance. The whole visible area partook in different degrees of a tint of pale yellow, and in some portions had acquired a brilliancy even painful to the eye. My view downward was also considerably impeded by the dense atmosphere in the vicinity of the surface being loaded with clouds, between whose masses I could only now and then obtain a glimpse of the earth itself. This difficulty of direct vision had troubled me more or less for the last forty-eight hours; but my present enormous elevation brought closer together, as it were, the floating bodies of vapor, and the inconvenience became, of course, more and more palpable in proportion to my ascent. Nevertheless, I could easily perceive that the balloon now hovered above the range of great lakes in the continent of North America, and was holding a course, due south, which would bring me to the tropics. This circumstance did not fail to give me the most heartful satisfaction, and I hailed it as a happy omen of ultimate success. Indeed, the direction I had hitherto taken, had filled me with uneasiness; for it was evident that, had I continued it much longer, there would have been no possibility of my arriving at the moon at all, whose orbit is inclined to the ecliptic at only the small angle of 5 degrees 8' 48\".\r\n\r\n> April 9th. To-day the earth's diameter was greatly diminished, and the color of the surface assumed hourly a deeper tint of yellow. The balloon kept steadily on her course to the southward, and arrived, at nine P.M., over the northern edge of the Mexican Gulf.\r\n\r\n> April 10th. I was suddenly aroused from slumber, about five o'clock this morning, by a loud, crackling, and terrific sound, for which I could in no manner account. It was of very brief duration, but, while it lasted resembled nothing in the world of which I had any previous experience. It is needless to say that I became excessively alarmed, having, in the first instance, attributed the noise to the bursting of the balloon. I examined all my apparatus, however, with great attention, and could discover nothing out of order. Spent a great part of the day in meditating upon an occurrence so extraordinary, but could find no means whatever of accounting for it. Went to bed dissatisfied, and in a state of great anxiety and agitation.\r\n\r\n> April 11th. Found a startling diminution in the apparent diameter of the earth, and a considerable increase, now observable for the first time, in that of the moon itself, which wanted only a few days of being full. It now required long and excessive labor to condense within the chamber sufficient atmospheric air for the sustenance of life.\r\n\r\n> April 12th. A singular alteration took place in regard to the direction of the balloon, and although fully anticipated, afforded me the most unequivocal delight. Having reached, in its former course, about the twentieth parallel of southern latitude, it turned off suddenly, at an acute angle, to the eastward, and thus proceeded throughout the day, keeping nearly, if not altogether, in the exact plane of the lunar ellipse. What was worthy of remark, a very perceptible vacillation in the car was a consequence of this change of route- a vacillation which prevailed, in a more or less degree, for a period of many hours.\r\n\r\n> April 13th. Was again very much alarmed by a repetition of the loud, crackling noise which terrified me on the tenth. Thought long upon the subject, but was unable to form any satisfactory conclusion. Great decrease in the earth's apparent diameter, which now subtended from the balloon an angle of very little more than twenty-five degrees. The moon could not be seen at all, being nearly in my zenith. I still continued in the plane of the ellipse, but made little progress to the eastward.\r\n\r\n> April 14th. Extremely rapid decrease in the diameter of the earth. To-day I became strongly impressed with the idea, that the balloon was now actually running up the line of apsides to the point of perigee- in other words, holding the direct course which would bring it immediately to the moon in that part of its orbit the nearest to the earth. The moon itself was directly overhead, and consequently hidden from my view. Great and long-continued labor necessary for the condensation of the atmosphere.\r\n\r\n> April 15th. Not even the outlines of continents and seas could now be traced upon the earth with anything approaching distinctness. About twelve o'clock I became aware, for the third time, of that appalling sound which had so astonished me before. It now, however, continued for some moments, and gathered intensity as it continued. At length, while, stupefied and terror-stricken, I stood in expectation of I knew not what hideous destruction, the car vibrated with excessive violence, and a gigantic and flaming mass of some material which I could not distinguish, came with a voice of a thousand thunders, roaring and booming by the balloon. When my fears and astonishment had in some degree subsided, I had little difficulty in supposing it to be some mighty volcanic fragment ejected from that world to which I was so rapidly approaching, and, in all probability, one of that singular class of substances occasionally picked up on the earth, and termed meteoric stones for want of a better appellation.\r\n\r\n> April 16th. To-day, looking upward as well as I could, through each of the side windows alternately, I beheld, to my great delight, a very small portion of the moon's disk protruding, as it were, on all sides beyond the huge circumference of the balloon. My agitation was extreme; for I had now little doubt of soon reaching the end of my perilous voyage. Indeed, the labor now required by the condenser had increased to a most oppressive degree, and allowed me scarcely any respite from exertion. Sleep was a matter nearly out of the question. I became quite ill, and my frame trembled with exhaustion. It was impossible that human nature could endure this state of intense suffering much longer. During the now brief interval of darkness a meteoric stone again passed in my vicinity, and the frequency of these phenomena began to occasion me much apprehension.\r\n\r\n> April 17th. This morning proved an epoch in my voyage. It will be remembered that, on the thirteenth, the earth subtended an angular breadth of twenty-five degrees. On the fourteenth this had greatly diminished; on the fifteenth a still more remarkable decrease was observable; and, on retiring on the night of the sixteenth, I had noticed an angle of no more than about seven degrees and fifteen minutes. What, therefore, must have been my amazement, on awakening from a brief and disturbed slumber, on the morning of this day, the seventeenth, at finding the surface beneath me so suddenly and wonderfully augmented in volume, as to subtend no less than thirty-nine degrees in apparent angular diameter! I was thunderstruck! No words can give any adequate idea of the extreme, the absolute horror and astonishment, with which I was seized possessed, and altogether overwhelmed. My knees tottered beneath me- my teeth chattered- my hair started up on end. \"The balloon, then, had actually burst!\" These were the first tumultuous ideas that hurried through my mind: \"The balloon had positively burst!- I was falling- falling with the most impetuous, the most unparalleled velocity! To judge by the immense distance already so quickly passed over, it could not be more than ten minutes, at the farthest, before I should meet the surface of the earth, and be hurled into annihilation!\" But at length reflection came to my relief. I paused; I considered; and I began to doubt. The matter was impossible. I could not in any reason have so rapidly come down. Besides, although I was evidently approaching the surface below me, it was with a speed by no means commensurate with the velocity I had at first so horribly conceived. This consideration served to calm the perturbation of my mind, and I finally succeeded in regarding the phenomenon in its proper point of view. In fact, amazement must have fairly deprived me of my senses, when I could not see the vast difference, in appearance, between the surface below me, and the surface of my mother earth. The latter was indeed over my head, and completely hidden by the balloon, while the moon- the moon itself in all its glory- lay beneath me, and at my feet.\r\n\r\n> The stupor and surprise produced in my mind by this extraordinary change in the posture of affairs was perhaps, after all, that part of the adventure least susceptible of explanation. For the bouleversement in itself was not only natural and inevitable, but had been long actually anticipated as a circumstance to be expected whenever I should arrive at that exact point of my voyage where the attraction of the planet should be superseded by the attraction of the satellite- or, more precisely, where the gravitation of the balloon toward the earth should be less powerful than its gravitation toward the moon. To be sure I arose from a sound slumber, with all my senses in confusion, to the contemplation of a very startling phenomenon, and one which, although expected, was not expected at the moment. The revolution itself must, of course, have taken place in an easy and gradual manner, and it is by no means clear that, had I even been awake at the time of the occurrence, I should have been made aware of it by any internal evidence of an inversion- that is to say, by any inconvenience or disarrangement, either about my person or about my apparatus.\r\n\r\n> It is almost needless to say that, upon coming to a due sense of my situation, and emerging from the terror which had absorbed every faculty of my soul, my attention was, in the first place, wholly directed to the contemplation of the general physical appearance of the moon. It lay beneath me like a chart- and although I judged it to be still at no inconsiderable distance, the indentures of its surface were defined to my vision with a most striking and altogether unaccountable distinctness. The entire absence of ocean or sea, and indeed of any lake or river, or body of water whatsoever, struck me, at first glance, as the most extraordinary feature in its geological condition. Yet, strange to say, I beheld vast level regions of a character decidedly alluvial, although by far the greater portion of the hemisphere in sight was covered with innumerable volcanic mountains, conical in shape, and having more the appearance of artificial than of natural protuberance. The highest among them does not exceed three and three-quarter miles in perpendicular elevation; but a map of the volcanic districts of the Campi Phlegraei would afford to your Excellencies a better idea of their general surface than any unworthy description I might think proper to attempt. The greater part of them were in a state of evident eruption, and gave me fearfully to understand their fury and their power, by the repeated thunders of the miscalled meteoric stones, which now rushed upward by the balloon with a frequency more and more appalling.\r\n\r\n> April 18th. To-day I found an enormous increase in the moon's apparent bulk- and the evidently accelerated velocity of my descent began to fill me with alarm. It will be remembered, that, in the earliest stage of my speculations upon the possibility of a passage to the moon, the existence, in its vicinity, of an atmosphere, dense in proportion to the bulk of the planet, had entered largely into my calculations; this too in spite of many theories to the contrary, and, it may be added, in spite of a general disbelief in the existence of any lunar atmosphere at all. But, in addition to what I have already urged in regard to Encke's comet and the zodiacal light, I had been strengthened in my opinion by certain observations of Mr. Schroeter, of Lilienthal. He observed the moon when two days and a half old, in the evening soon after sunset, before the dark part was visible, and continued to watch it until it became visible. The two cusps appeared tapering in a very sharp faint prolongation, each exhibiting its farthest extremity faintly illuminated by the solar rays, before any part of the dark hemisphere was visible. Soon afterward, the whole dark limb became illuminated. This prolongation of the cusps beyond the semicircle, I thought, must have arisen from the refraction of the sun's rays by the moon's atmosphere. I computed, also, the height of the atmosphere (which could refract light enough into its dark hemisphere to produce a twilight more luminous than the light reflected from the earth when the moon is about 32 degrees from the new) to be 1,356 Paris feet; in this view, I supposed the greatest height capable of refracting the solar ray, to be 5,376 feet. My ideas on this topic had also received confirmation by a passage in the eighty-second volume of the Philosophical Transactions, in which it is stated that at an occultation of Jupiter's satellites, the third disappeared after having been about 1\" or 2\" of time indistinct, and the fourth became indiscernible near the limb.*\r\n> *Havelius writes that he has several times found, in skies perfectly clear, when even stars of the sixth and seventh magnitude were conspicuous, that, at the same altitude of the moon, at the same elongation from the earth, and with one and the same excellent telescope, the moon and its maculae did not appear equally lucid at all times. From the circumstances of the observation, it is evident that the cause of this phenomenon is not either in our air, in the tube, in the moon, or in the eye of the spectator, but must be looked for in something (an atmosphere?) existing about the moon.\r\n\r\n> Cassini frequently observed Saturn, Jupiter, and the fixed stars, when approaching the moon to occultation, to have their circular figure changed into an oval one; and, in other occultations, he found no alteration of figure at all. Hence it might be supposed, that at some times and not at others, there is a dense matter encompassing the moon wherein the rays of the stars are refracted.\r\n\r\n> Upon the resistance or, more properly, upon the support of an atmosphere, existing in the state of density imagined, I had, of course, entirely depended for the safety of my ultimate descent. Should I then, after all, prove to have been mistaken, I had in consequence nothing better to expect, as a finale to my adventure, than being dashed into atoms against the rugged surface of the satellite. And, indeed, I had now every reason to be terrified. My distance from the moon was comparatively trifling, while the labor required by the condenser was diminished not at all, and I could discover no indication whatever of a decreasing rarity in the air.\r\n\r\n> April 19th. This morning, to my great joy, about nine o'clock, the surface of the moon being frightfully near, and my apprehensions excited to the utmost, the pump of my condenser at length gave evident tokens of an alteration in the atmosphere. By ten, I had reason to believe its density considerably increased. By eleven, very little labor was necessary at the apparatus; and at twelve o'clock, with some hesitation, I ventured to unscrew the tourniquet, when, finding no inconvenience from having done so, I finally threw open the gum-elastic chamber, and unrigged it from around the car. As might have been expected, spasms and violent headache were the immediate consequences of an experiment so precipitate and full of danger. But these and other difficulties attending respiration, as they were by no means so great as to put me in peril of my life, I determined to endure as I best could, in consideration of my leaving them behind me momently in my approach to the denser strata near the moon. This approach, however, was still impetuous in the extreme; and it soon became alarmingly certain that, although I had probably not been deceived in the expectation of an atmosphere dense in proportion to the mass of the satellite, still I had been wrong in supposing this density, even at the surface, at all adequate to the support of the great weight contained in the car of my balloon. Yet this should have been the case, and in an equal degree as at the surface of the earth, the actual gravity of bodies at either planet supposed in the ratio of the atmospheric condensation. That it was not the case, however, my precipitous downfall gave testimony enough; why it was not so, can only be explained by a reference to those possible geological disturbances to which I have formerly alluded. At all events I was now close upon the planet, and coming down with the most terrible impetuosity. I lost not a moment, accordingly, in throwing overboard first my ballast, then my water-kegs, then my condensing apparatus and gum-elastic chamber, and finally every article within the car. But it was all to no purpose. I still fell with horrible rapidity, and was now not more than half a mile from the surface. As a last resource, therefore, having got rid of my coat, hat, and boots, I cut loose from the balloon the car itself, which was of no inconsiderable weight, and thus, clinging with both hands to the net-work, I had barely time to observe that the whole country, as far as the eye could reach, was thickly interspersed with diminutive habitations, ere I tumbled headlong into the very heart of a fantastical-looking city, and into the middle of a vast crowd of ugly little people, who none of them uttered a single syllable, or gave themselves the least trouble to render me assistance, but stood, like a parcel of idiots, grinning in a ludicrous manner, and eyeing me and my balloon askant, with their arms set a-kimbo. I turned from them in contempt, and, gazing upward at the earth so lately left, and left perhaps for ever, beheld it like a huge, dull, copper shield, about two degrees in diameter, fixed immovably in the heavens overhead, and tipped on one of its edges with a crescent border of the most brilliant gold. No traces of land or water could be discovered, and the whole was clouded with variable spots, and belted with tropical and equatorial zones.\r\n\r\n> Thus, may it please your Excellencies, after a series of great anxieties, unheard of dangers, and unparalleled escapes, I had, at length, on the nineteenth day of my departure from Rotterdam, arrived in safety at the conclusion of a voyage undoubtedly the most extraordinary, and the most momentous, ever accomplished, undertaken, or conceived by any denizen of earth. But my adventures yet remain to be related. And indeed your Excellencies may well imagine that, after a residence of five years upon a planet not only deeply interesting in its own peculiar character, but rendered doubly so by its intimate connection, in capacity of satellite, with the world inhabited by man, I may have intelligence for the private ear of the States' College of Astronomers of far more importance than the details, however wonderful, of the mere voyage which so happily concluded. This is, in fact, the case. I have much- very much which it would give me the greatest pleasure to communicate. I have much to say of the climate of the planet; of its wonderful alternations of heat and cold, of unmitigated and burning sunshine for one fortnight, and more than polar frigidity for the next; of a constant transfer of moisture, by distillation like that in vacuo, from the point beneath the sun to the point the farthest from it; of a variable zone of running water, of the people themselves; of their manners, customs, and political institutions; of their peculiar physical construction; of their ugliness; of their want of ears, those useless appendages in an atmosphere so peculiarly modified; of their consequent ignorance of the use and properties of speech; of their substitute for speech in a singular method of inter-communication; of the incomprehensible connection between each particular individual in the moon with some particular individual on the earth- a connection analogous with, and depending upon, that of the orbs of the planet and the satellites, and by means of which the lives and destinies of the inhabitants of the one are interwoven with the lives and destinies of the inhabitants of the other; and above all, if it so please your Excellencies- above all, of those dark and hideous mysteries which lie in the outer regions of the moon- regions which, owing to the almost miraculous accordance of the satellite's rotation on its own axis with its sidereal revolution about the earth, have never yet been turned, and, by God's mercy, never shall be turned, to the scrutiny of the telescopes of man. All this, and more- much more- would I most willingly detail. But, to be brief, I must have my reward. I am pining for a return to my family and to my home, and as the price of any farther communication on my part- in consideration of the light which I have it in my power to throw upon many very important branches of physical and metaphysical science- I must solicit, through the influence of your honorable body, a pardon for the crime of which I have been guilty in the death of the creditors upon my departure from Rotterdam. This, then, is the object of the present paper. Its bearer, an inhabitant of the moon, whom I have prevailed upon, and properly instructed, to be my messenger to the earth, will await your Excellencies' pleasure, and return to me with the pardon in question, if it can, in any manner, be obtained.\r\n\r\n> I have the honor to be, etc., your Excellencies' very humble servant,\r\n\r\n> HANS PHAALL.\r\n\r\nUpon finishing the perusal of this very extraordinary document, Professor Rub-a-dub, it is said, dropped his pipe upon the ground in the extremity of his surprise, and Mynheer Superbus Von Underduk having taken off his spectacles, wiped them, and deposited them in his pocket, so far forgot both himself and his dignity, as to turn round three times upon his heel in the quintessence of astonishment and admiration. There was no doubt about the matter- the pardon should be obtained. So at least swore, with a round oath, Professor Rub-a-dub, and so finally thought the illustrious Von Underduk, as he took the arm of his brother in science, and without saying a word, began to make the best of his way home to deliberate upon the measures to be adopted. Having reached the door, however, of the burgomaster's dwelling, the professor ventured to suggest that as the messenger had thought proper to disappear- no doubt frightened to death by the savage appearance of the burghers of Rotterdam- the pardon would be of little use, as no one but a man of the moon would undertake a voyage to so vast a distance. To the truth of this observation the burgomaster assented, and the matter was therefore at an end. Not so, however, rumors and speculations. The letter, having been published, gave rise to a variety of gossip and opinion. Some of the over-wise even made themselves ridiculous by decrying the whole business; as nothing better than a hoax. But hoax, with these sort of people, is, I believe, a general term for all matters above their comprehension. For my part, I cannot conceive upon what data they have founded such an accusation. Let us see what they say:\r\n\r\nImprimus. That certain wags in Rotterdam have certain especial antipathies to certain burgomasters and astronomers.\r\n\r\nSecondly. That an odd little dwarf and bottle conjurer, both of whose ears, for some misdemeanor, have been cut off close to his head, has been missing for several days from the neighboring city of Bruges.\r\n\r\nThirdly. That the newspapers which were stuck all over the little balloon were newspapers of Holland, and therefore could not have been made in the moon. They were dirty papers- very dirty- and Gluck, the printer, would take his Bible oath to their having been printed in Rotterdam.\r\n\r\nHe was mistaken- undoubtedly- mistaken.\r\n\r\nFourthly, That Hans Phaall himself, the druken villain, and the three very idle gentlemen styled his creditors, were all seen, no longer than two or three days ago, in a tippling house in the suburbs, having just returned, with money in their pockets, from a trip beyond the sea.\r\n\r\nDon't believe it- don't believe a word of it.\r\n\r\nLastly. That it is an opinion very generally received, or which ought to be generally received, that the College of Astronomers in the city of Rotterdam, as well as other colleges in all other parts of the world,- not to mention colleges and astronomers in general,- are, to say the least of the matter, not a whit better, nor greater, nor wiser than they ought to be.","views":43,"updated":"2022-05-03T11:54:31Z","tags":[],"type":null,"title":"The Unparalleled Adventure of One Hans Phall\r","slug":"the-unparalleled-adventure-of-one-hans-phall-5qnm","appearance":"sans","language":"en","rtl":false,"created":"2022-05-03T11:54:32Z","paid":false},{"id":"25rmccj1gutihp2f","body":"Not like the brazen giant of Greek fame,\r\nWith conquering limbs astride from land to land;\r\nHere at our sea-washed, sunset gates shall stand\r\nA mighty woman with a torch, whose flame\r\nIs the imprisoned lightning, and her name\r\nMother of Exiles.

Considering how much I read on a daily basis on media and the web, it’s quite pitiful that I would end up discovering their[]() existence as the majority of eventual users will, the app relaunching lands on the Home tab, which now features the Instagram Stories-derived Fleets gallery as the top header. I’m not sure what this looks like for the average user, but for me, it is always stocked with blue-embossed circular profile pictures - all people I followed in the decade+ before I hit my limit., but often cannot recall when or why. Suffice it to say, it’s unlikely I would easily run out of Fleets to watch if I ever find myself in a stage of obsessive Fleet consumption. Spaces only came to my attention when I happened to spot a *purple* cluster of rounded profile pictures in this menu. Naturally, I tapped immediately, and found myself in a Space run by [Matt Daniels](https:\/\/twitter.com\/mygunisquick) and including [Mike Elgan](https:\/\/twitter.com\/mikeelgan) as speaker. You might notice, now, following those hyperlinks, that both have the Purple Circle emoji 🟣 in front of their display names on their Profiles. They explained that it’s become a trend among those who’ve been granted Spaces access to indicate that they are testing and *discussing* Spaces.\n\nI was lucky to happen upon this particular Space - Matt was a fairly-prolific Periscope broadcaster, and that dearest app came up in the conversation just as I was approved as a speaker to mention it. I noted that I’d heard Spaces was built atop the technology Twitter acquired from Periscope in its acquisition and cited [my recent observations](https:\/\/twitter.com\/neoyokel\/status\/1260074702204293121) of my own experiences on that late service, asking whether or not Spaces would eventually meet a similar fate. I’d been suggesting that Periscope was the only entirely-positive social network experience I’d ever encountered, noting that I still wasn’t instinctively compelled to open the app nearly as much as I should have been, however. Matt’s response was quite profound: as a regular and popular Periscope broadcaster, his perspective was that its fundamental problem lied in insufficient filtering of its text chat. He said that Spaces’ exclusion of that feature was an important component of its potential, along with the fundamental implications behind new guests being muted by default. I hadn’t yet figured out a method of recording Spaces (more on that in a bit,) so I would qualify my account of this conversation in a big way, but I vaguely recall Mike chiming in to relay a sentiment he’d heard from Twitter employees in another recent Space: they understood and explicitly intended to continue in the text chat-less direction because of feedback from Periscope creators like Matt.\n\nFor myself, the general praise of Spaces (and Clubhouse, adjacently) as a democratizing new social feature definitely resonates. In just that first experience, I was given the opportunity to speak directly to Matt and Mike - the later of whom I have been reading and listening to for my whole adult life. He even followed me after the Space ended. Yesterday, I happened upon a Space hosted by [Ben Popper](https:\/\/twitter.com\/benpopper?s=21) - formerly one of my favorites on *The Verge*’s masthead - in which he was broadcasting [his impressively-disciplined turkey calls](https:\/\/whyp.it\/t\/ben-poppers-turkey-calls-46198) from “a shed in the woods.” He approved me as speaker immediately and was incredibly accommodating of my questions about his former colleagues and  recent life events. (He’s now living “rurally” and working as Director of Content at Stack Overflow - neither of which I would have ever expected.)\n\nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=ZZH-SHzE8XQ\n\nYet another former *Verge* staffer, [Sam Scheffer](https:\/\/twitter.com\/samsheffer), has been the most active Spaces user on my Timeline. Notably, he is one of the only Twitter Tech Media folks I know who has continued to be honest with himself and the world about his feelings about the service. Among a crop of people who once exclaimed shit like “I *love* Twitter” and “I *live* on Twitter,” his singular continued use of such terms reflects something significant, I think. Understandably given Tump Hell, it is now very popular to lament Twitter whenever possible, even among those who’s volume of use has not changed in any measurable way. I don’t think it’s reaching to say that Sam and I are alike in our desire to try out whatever we’re tossed the keys to in as extreme a degree as possible. I’ve stopped by a handful of his Spaces - which are often also about Spaces, itself. Most recently however, he approved me to speak in a Space including a host of Silicon Valley folk and at least one Microsoft employee, talking about the future of AR and VR, vaguely in response to Microsoft’s Ignite event, which legitimately disturbed me.\n\nhttps:\/\/twitter.com\/neoyokel\/status\/1366804088629919744\n\nI probably waited too long to speak up, until he was trying to wrap up the Space - but I did chime in about the way the Ignite keynote made me feel and attempted to convey the contrast between the goals of the tech industry and the general attitudes toward AR and VR present in the Midwesterners around me. Essentially, I was granted yet another unique *opportunity* to ask a question that’s been bothering me for years, now: *what the fuck are you doing and why???* It was the Microsoft Man (I can’t find his account, now, sorry) who responded very promptly, considering, with an explanation that actually made a lot of sense. The gist of it was *we are contending with the idea that we may never work in an office again, and these technologies offer a difficult-to-explain amends*. He specifically used the term “fatigue” in describing his own experiences trying to collaborate remotely and reflected on the benefits of virtual context on the most elemental, sensory components of interaction throughout a workday. From that ~45 second response, I feel as though I gained more understanding than I have from years of reading on my own, which further reinforces his observations, in retrospect.\n\n~~[[Kali Tweet Embed](https:\/\/twitter.com\/kalibration\/status\/1371021244762619904)]~~ (Kali’s account is private right now.) \n\nAlready, it would seem Twitter Spaces might have a lot to offer David Blue, going forward. Though I signed up for Clubhouse’s waiting list last year (twice, in fact, but please don’t tell on me,) I have yet to hear back from them. If I was a bitter person, I would be up in arms about this, citing the fact that I would probably contribute more to the wellbeing of the project, technically, than 90% of those who’ve been invited. (I am the physical manifestation of the *Stress Test*, and I spend an absurd amount of time on beta feedback, [even on software *I’m fucking paying for*](https:\/\/twitter.com\/neoyokel\/status\/1362822335041048577).) From what I originally heard, though, Clubhouse was showing real promise as a space where creators of color felt in control of their experience. I hope this has continued to be true and - if it has - I say *never* invite me. \n\nhttps:\/\/youtube.com\/watch?v=DajJqoufzAg\n\n## The Social and The Socialites\nCrucially, though, enabling [my tech bro ass](https:\/\/twitter.com\/neoyokel\/status\/1370838780333146118) to engage with famous tech bros about tech bro shit is never going to justifiably occupy anyone’s list of priorities in my lifetime (including my own.) The original promise of the internet did not include amplification of voices already\/otherwise at max volume. Instead, it was using technology to deliver new, varying, and universally-empowering tools of expression to those who’d been minimized for all of human history. It didn’t have to be philanthropic - in fact, it was and shall always remain in the best interest of the loudest folks to hear from the other side of the spectrum. The possibilities of this dynamic should be *thrilling* to all involved, and it used to be for Twitter, Inc. Or so it seemed, anyway. As the company has honed its various loglines over the years, their actions have reflected their truth less and less. \n\nhttps:\/\/open.spotify.com\/episode\/65yv6gvutNjjCrF4oeQFlc\n\nCoincidentally, the most visible co-founder of Periscope, [Kayvon Beykpour](https:\/\/twitter.com\/kayvz), is now Twitter’s Head of Consumer product, and he spent this past week doing interviews about Twitter’s late feature frenzy. I want to share two very different podcast episodes with two very different interviewers. [Nilay Patel’s *Decoder* interview](https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/22319527\/twitter-kayvon-beykpour-interview-consumer-product-decoder) should probably be first priority as the more comprehensive and digestible of the two.\n\n> We started it from the standpoint of “why are people not tweeting?” It turns out that some of the reasons they’re not tweeting is they don’t feel safe. They don’t feel safe because what they tweet is subject to public scrutiny. Tweets are on the public record, which is terrifying. Anyone can respond to them, and they’re such a popularity contest of likes and retweets and impressions and all of the social mechanics that we’ve built in the product that actually work quite well for a certain purpose, but can work against you if you’re just trying to have a conversation and feel intimidated by that.   \n\n“Why are people not tweeting” justifies us taking a moment to indulge some hilarity: imagine Jack and his hellbeard wandering around the abandoned Twitter office screaming that question at the walls, over and over again. Bekypour’s decision to identify one’s “on the public record” Tweets as “terrifying” could easily be tossed back at the company in the center of a dense globule of shit, but one imagines it’d hardly be constructive. I’m going to take my furthest leap here and suggest that we examine who exactly Kayvon was considering - those who find on Twitter a “popularity context of likes and retweets and impressions,” and feel “intimidated” by it. Those I’ve known on Twitter who’ve had negative experiences or have otherwise felt the need to take greater control of a given moment’s interactions generally make use of the “Protect My Tweets” selection in their account’s privacy settings. (This is called “private Twitter,” in case you’re unfamiliar.) This was clearly on the minds of whoever crafted [the official Twitter Support page on Spaces](https:\/\/help.twitter.com\/en\/using-twitter\/spaces):\n\n> Accounts with protected Tweets are not able to create Spaces. They are able to join and speak in other people’s Spaces, and their presence will be visible to other participants.  \n\nI’ve been thinking a lot about this and come to the conclusion that Kayvon was speaking of a relative minority of Twitter users in his explanation, consciously or not. It’s telling that I was unable to find the statistics of an average Twitter account’s number of daily interactions, but it also means I have to make yet another supposition: even most *regular* Twitter users rarely experience an overwhelming amount of what I’ll call account-specific notifications (mentions, replies, likes, and retweets, as distinct from algorithmically-sourced content recommendations.) I could be wrong, but I would argue that only the most popular Twitter users - those most visible by way of all sorts of celebredom - are under pressure to consider “the public record.” When Kayvon explains Twitter’s interest in making Spaces ephemeral, he is speaking for the “clients” who make Twitter a (debatably) viable **business**. This should not be surprising or damning, necessarily, but only so long as it is emphasized.\n\nhttps:\/\/soundcloud.com\/compaqclub\/twitter-spaces\n\nEarly in the interview, Nilay “reframes” the pillars of Twitter’s current development as described by Bekypour. “Health,” he observes, “is basically just the overwhelming content moderation problem that every social platform faces.” A large, most uncomfortable component of this “problem,” is just another manifestation of the age-old dynamic between celebrities and everyone else. The tools Twitter is building along this line are designed to enable the social upper class (if you will) to better manage their interactions with the masses. Abstractly, Twitter sounds like an inherently democratizing space as described to an unfamiliar party. The personal experiences with Spaces I outlined were undoubtedly democratizing *for me*, but the essence of this new direction Twitter has taken - led by the co-mastermind of what I would call the most democratized social platform of our time - is an explicit, clearer-than-ever commitment to amplify the already\/otherwise amplified voices which belt the song of popular relevancy.\n\nhttps:\/\/open.spotify.com\/episode\/6vwtqtbk2CbiLJUBPWu8qA\n\n## Scope History in Scope\nThe [other important Bekypour interview](https:\/\/onezero.medium.com\/the-story-behind-twitters-revival-a-conversation-with-twitter-product-head-kayvon-beykpour-d52127e31eec) comes via Alex Kantrowitz’s *Big Technology Podcast*, who is notably much less Vox media glossy than Nilay in his questions. When he asks why Spaces ended up looking so similar to Clubhouse, Bekypour responds with an revealing anecdote on Periscope’s story:\n\n> Well, we’ve been thinking about audio for quite some time. And it’s funny, actually, the code name for the project internally is called Kaleidoscope because when we started working a year ago and winding down Periscope, we knew that there were aspects of Periscope that we wanted to live on from a use case standpoint, putting aside the technology.  \n\nIndeed, it was under Twitter’s tenure that Periscope [first added audio-only broadcasting](https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/09\/07\/twitter-launches-audio-only-broadcasting-feature-on-its-ios-app-and-periscope\/) in September 2018, followed by [audio-only guest call-ins](https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/02\/04\/periscopes-latest-feature-turns-your-broadcast-into-a-radio-talk-show\/) in February of the next year. My occasional check-ins with the community and brief skim of the iOS app’s release notes suggest that Periscope’s technical development staff were then quickly diverted to other projects, fired, or killed. The language in the service’s self-published Medium obituary is aggravatingly avoidant of any responsibility for the state of disrepair Periscope has subsequently found itself in:\n\n> The truth is that the Periscope app is in an unsustainable maintenance-mode state, and has been for a while.  \n\n*We have no idea how this happened! What a tragedy! Our sympathies.*\n\n> Over the past couple of years, we’ve seen declining usage and know that the cost to support the app will only continue to go up over time. Leaving it in its current state isn’t doing right by the current and former Periscope community or by Twitter.  \n\nRead: News networks don’t bother to simulcast to Periscope anymore and we can’t remember the last time any sort of celebrity said something controversial enough on our platform to get pscp.tv in the news. “Nobody at the wheel” has been my recent favorite idiom to staple on software\/services that have remained “on the market,” so to speak - still taking money\/account signups\/other contemporary manifestations of currency exchange, and yet *appear* abandoned under varying degrees of scrutiny. (Clyp.it is the most [recently relevant](https:\/\/bit.ly\/enduserwhyp) example I’ve investigated.) I should disclaim that I have no idea what it’s like to work for a software company - my only *real* technology employment was for a small-time IT company. I should also disclose that my intentional exploration of the open source\/open web\/decentralized community since early 2018 has definitely incubated a few biases toward the abstract idealism present in their preferred methodologies. What I’m really saying: I find the whole spectrum of secrecy purveyed and practiced in the realm of proprietary software *utterly absurd*. The fact that I and others on the beat must *speculate* if we’re to discuss the history of a given app’s development in any detail is ridiculous for many reasons which are inappropriate to dive into, here.\n\n![Unrequited Twitter Spaces Support DM](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/tEvlLAkm.jpeg)\n\nA relevant, real-world example of the sort of silly mysteriousness this attitude manifests is the process by which I gained “early” access to Twitter Spaces on my main account, [@NeoYokel](https:\/\/twitter.com\/NeoYokel), over the course of this writing. I noticed it’d been enabled almost exactly 24 hours after the timestamp on the DM (screenshotted above) I sent [@TwitterSpaces](https:\/\/twitter.com\/TwitterSpaces) from [@dieselgoth](https:\/\/twitter.com\/dieselgoth) - an alt I created last year mostly to spare my longtime followers from live racing Tweet spam which was granted Spaces access first, despite having been almost 100% dormant for months. I don’t think it’d be unreasonable to assume my main account was explicitly\/manually given access by a Twitter employee  as a direct result of that message, but I’ll never know for sure because it has yet to receive any response. As I [Tweeted](https:\/\/twitter.com\/NeoYokel\/status\/1374639645833711616), I am far from personally up in arms because Twitter, Incorporated decided to *leave me on read*, but my young imagination conjures a million scenarios involving different sorts of people in which such a lack of acknowledgement certainly *would* be quite a deal, justifiably or not. All I’d ask is *for what reason, exactly*? \n\nThe most essential acknowledgement I must make, though, is that the two Spaces I’ve started since gaining access received absolutely zero engagement, despite the latter being timed and labeled as optimally as I could personally manage *and* left open for more than an hour. This is in stark contrast to my early experiences on Periscope, especially, which were the heavyweights contributing to the sum of interactions throughout the history of my account, there. Of further note for context: **I garnered a more voluminous, active “following” on Periscope than I have on any other social media service** throughout the history of my internet presence. I felt it important to spell this out in the hope that this post would not become (or be regarded as) rudimentary bitching about how this story effects *me*, because it technically does - in a very specific, crucial manner - more than any other subject discussed in *The Psalms*. (If it comes across that way, or if you have any other thoughts to share, I would love nothing more than to “[hear](https:\/\/bit.ly\/dbrolodex)” them and optionally add them to this post.) I would hope my work has come across as *unnecessarily* (perhaps even *aggravatingly*) transparent, this far, but it’s especially essential in this case. As I continue to cite my experiences on my Periscope\/Twitter account(s,) I would also like to emphasize that I do so because 1) I don’t want to speak for anyone else and 2) I have access\/control to their full documentation as well as my own permission to share it as needed, **not** because I think (or would argue) that my experience on Twitter properties, going forward, should be served or optimized for in any way. I haven’t already invested two weeks in this subject at this point for the sake of improving my own online life, but to speak for those uncomfortable with revealing their voice (regarding text chat omission in Spaces,) and to critically reflect on what Spaces’ lack of discoverability (in contrast with Periscope, particularly) might mean for all Twitter users.\n\nWhile we’re this deep in the meta, let me also confess to you that I had long intended to write a thorough celebratory essay detailing my positive experiences on Periscope, but put it off too long. I’ve decided that this post shall have to take its place, so I’m therefore going to share the unedited draft of that essay from ::???::  in its entirety, now, marked by horizontal lines:\n\n- - - -\n\n# A Good Place: Periscope Magic\n\n![The Magic of Periscope](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/3fM96uY.jpg)\n## One livestreaming app has always been a fascinating, generally positive, and all around beautiful place.\n\nIn April, *The Outline* - one of my favorite Web Sites ever - [closed its virtual doors](https:\/\/www.niemanlab.org\/2020\/04\/the-outline-an-attempt-to-build-a-bolder-kind-of-news-site-appears-to-have-met-its-end\/). I should be more sad about this, but since before they even launched, they never responded to a single one of my emails. I sent them words of encouragement, admiration, spelling and pronoun corrections, and even a few pitches. Some of them were pretty good ideas, but I never once heard back. I pitched this piece, in fact, for their series called \"[A Good Place](https:\/\/theoutline.com\/post\/8423\/a-good-place-symbolics-internet-history-oldest-website),\" which began with the tag \"the internet is too much, but this place is just right.\" In general, it sought the more wholesome, \"positive\" bits of The Web and detailed the histories of - and some pseudotheraputic uses for - its often-quaint subjects. In my experience, I have not encountered anything more appropriate and yet *mainstream* for this supposition than Periscope, the live streaming app which [Twitter bought before its independent launch](https:\/\/www.businessinsider.com\/what-is-periscope-and-why-twitter-bought-it-2015-3) that's quietly taken a place which could only be its very own.\n\nhttps:\/\/twitter.com\/NeoYokel\/status\/1069117482647076865\n\nThrough this service, I have watched - and watched with - people from all over the world and met apparently lifelong friends. I've spoken to users in their first 3 weeks trying to learn English and laughed with many more who couldn't understand each other whatsoever. I've streamed out hundreds of hours of live improv piano and had conversations with folks lasting late into the night on just about everything. I have observed Martin Shkreli be a dick and popped into live interviews with celebrities at the beautiful, surreal Pebble Beach Concours d'Elegance. Periscope is [embedded more deeply in society](https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/magazine\/archive\/2020\/06\/qanon-nothing-can-stop-what-is-coming\/610567\/) than one would think, considering how little it's mentioned in media.\n\nhttps:\/\/youtube.com\/watch?v=0_0MynsbpOo\n\nIn February 2014, [Kayvon Beykpour](https:\/\/twitter.com\/kayvz) and [Joe Bernstein](https:\/\/twitter.com\/joebernstein) founded Periscope with a seed round from angel investors \"including Adobe executive Scott Belsky.\" A year later, Twitter [bought it for some $50-100 million](https:\/\/www.businessinsider.com\/twitter-acquires-periscope-for-a-sizable-amount-2015-3) (not even *Business Insider* knows for sure.) The app was briefly in direct competition with [Meerkat](https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2015\/03\/01\/meerkat\/) - the since-extinct [arguably originating](https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2015\/03\/08\/the-inevitable-democratization\/) service in the space.\n\n> By building a [dead-simple broadcasting interface that piggybacks on Twitter](https:\/\/beta.techcrunch.com\/2015\/03\/01\/meerkat\/)‘s interest graph for identity, communication, and distribution, Meerkat made the first mobile livestreaming app that “just works.\"\n\nMeerkat was an important rung in the ladder, but it ultimately [died](https:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/technology-37555100) at the hands of Periscope due to its lack of a stream archive. \"The [surprise emergence of Meerkat](http:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2015\/3\/17\/8234769\/how-meerkat-conquered-all-at-sxsw) as a social phenomenon this year has been accompanied by a frequent complaint: the links are usually dead by the time you click them,\" [reported Casey Newton for *The Verge*](https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2015\/3\/26\/8293353\/periscope-live-streaming-twitter-meerkat).\n\n> For everything it got right, Meerkat still looks like an app built in eight weeks — which it was. Periscope has been in development for more than a year, and the app arrives showing nice attention to detail.\n\nPeriscope, by contrast, maintains an [archive of past broadcasts](https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2016\/5\/9\/11635382\/periscope-permanent-broadcasts-search-drone-integration-dji) for a significant period and allows users to [save broadcasts locally](https:\/\/help.twitter.com\/en\/using-twitter\/save-broadcast) on their phones. We have to remember how much has changed in the past five years in mobile terms. [Dan Frommer in *Quartz*](https:\/\/qz.com\/365293\/it-took-a-decade-but-mobile-video-is-finally-exploding\/):\n\n> What has changed? Almost everything. Mobile phones are faster and more powerful, with large screens capable of displaying beautiful, high-definition video. Mobile networks—where LTE service is available, at least—can now easily handle high-quality streams in both directions. Data service is frequently affordable.\n\nhttps:\/\/youtube.com\/watch?v=s_1YEnJKjdw\n\nIn 2015-2016, I worked afternoons (3-11PM) at a grocery store gas station in a moderately-sized shopping center on the South side of Columbia, Missouri. After work, I'd sit in my old Jaguar parked in front of the laundromat (for the WiFi) chainsmoking cigarettes on Periscope, talking about anything. I found my only real following, ever there. Friends like [Juanita](https:\/\/www.pscp.tv\/Jquinta) and [Nicole](https:\/\/www.pscp.tv\/Nicole3) were made. [Ashers](https:\/\/www.pscp.tv\/OMFGAshers) bought me a pack of cigarettes once (thank you!)\n- - - -\n### Preservation\nYes, that’s where I stopped on June 14th of last year. Perhaps one day - assuming Twitter’s going to [stick to its word](https:\/\/twitter.com\/NeoYokel\/status\/1374680479874568194) and maintain an indefinite archive of all currently-viewable broadcasts - I will be able to justify investing further time in digging out more of my favorite scopes from others, but for now, I have begun [a Twitter List](https:\/\/twitter.com\/i\/lists\/1374664072654958594) specifically for mutuals I met on Periscope, but it’s limited to those who have a *public* Twitter profile linked to the Periscope account I know them from. I also (sortof accidentally) uploaded the 43 video files of my own broadcasts I had in my possession (obtained with tools like Scopedown) to [a playlist](https:\/\/youtube.com\/playlist?list=PLiI5-v1HgmCbWg_Pu-Mp0s1LTBBoVAI7A) on *Extratone*’s YouTube channel, not intending that they clog up the feed as they did. \n\nhttps:\/\/gist.github.com\/extratone\/614effdd51bac74793ef627a1174e972\n\n## The Magic Left Out\n\nYes, that’s where I stopped on June 14th of last year. Given just the exchanges I’ve had about Periscope in the past week, I suspect I would find writing its full history in non-fiction narrative form to be an incredible, desperately unique experience, just as the app has. As I write, the mobile app, itself, has five and half days left to live (before it’s removed from both the Google Play Store and Apple’s App Store.) Early yesterday morning, as I opened the app to my feed, I was unable to find any recent or currently-live broadcasts which made any mention of this reality, despite spirited scrolling. The same uncanny noise of Periscope’s trademark, infinitely-wide spectrum of use continued beneath the banner embedded above, which was only *very* recently updated with The End’s specific date. It doesn’t really agitate my own personal urgency, either (if you cared to know,) because I’ve endured the luxury of existence from a perspective of such thorough latency with reality for so long that I have all but forgotten the experience of actually expecting to finish anything on time.[^1]\n\n[^1]: I’ve even managed to exhaust the stage where I found my own slow pace entertaining, which is a definite first. It’s not even funny how long it takes me to do *anythihng* anymore, it’s just a fact.**","views":64,"updated":"2022-05-05T05:22:22Z","tags":[],"type":null,"title":"","slug":"echoes-in-twitter-spaces","appearance":"norm","language":"","rtl":false,"created":"2022-05-05T05:22:23Z","images":["https:\/\/i.snap.as\/tEvlLAkm.jpeg","https:\/\/i.snap.as\/3fM96uY.jpg","https:\/\/i.snap.as\/1JykaVQ1.png"],"paid":false},{"id":"xn0tygnlxk9l1lnv","body":"# Siri Shortcuts and More for Tot\n- [GitHub Issue](https:\/\/github.com\/extratone\/bilge\/issues\/314)\n- [WTF](drafts:\/\/open?uuid=E6D127B8-B5CE-45F5-8D6A-0BC5CE12A149)\n- [Tilde](https:\/\/tilde.town\/~extratone\/tot\/)\n\n![Tot Folder](https:\/\/user-images.githubusercontent.com\/43663476\/159338345-8ea492b1-de57-4b41-8461-3655c35be400.png)\n\nI’d lusted after Iconfactory’s [Tot](https:\/\/tot.rocks) for its app icons for a long time, but it wasn’t until a sale at the beginning of the year that I actually dove in and bought [Tot Pocket](https:\/\/apps.apple.com\/us\/app\/tot-pocket\/id1498235191) - the iOS app. As a primarily iPhone-bound user, now, I’ve found it extremely handy as a container for URL-scheme-powered links, largely to run Siri Shortcuts and open specific drafts in [Drafts](https:\/\/apps.apple.com\/us\/app\/drafts\/id1435957248).\n\n![Tot Dashboard Compare](https:\/\/user-images.githubusercontent.com\/43663476\/160951975-ebc1cc18-3a90-4372-988b-779d69deed28.png)\n\nTot’s had its own URL scheme all along, which I utilized in two published Drafts actions: “[Append to 7th Tot Dot](https:\/\/actions.getdrafts.com\/a\/1uL)” (which works cross-platform) and “[Fetch Contents of # Tot Dot](https:\/\/actions.getdrafts.com\/a\/1ub)” (which uses Applescript and is therefore macOS-only.) Here’s an example of the scheme, itself:\n\n```\ntot:\/\/7\/append?text=%0A[Text]\n```\n\nFor better or worse, though, there is now a much more reliable solution. Iconfactory [added Siri Shortcuts actions for Tot](https:\/\/blog.iconfactory.com\/2022\/03\/tot-shortcuts-geek-bliss\/) on all supported platforms, and I’ve already switched to using them, instead. I find the overview in their blog post (and release notes) to be a bit vague, so I think it’s worth [listing](https:\/\/www.icloud.com\/shortcuts\/06b41c1e86b8485bbfa7f8aafa82b127) each of the new actions:\n\n![Tot Actions Showcase](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/tWyBQKCI.png)\n\n1. **Add to Dot** - “Adds text to a dot by prepending or appending.”\n2. **Get Dot** - “Gets all the text from a dot.”\n3. **Query Dot** - “Gets text and [JSON data + metadata] from a dot.”\n4. **Set Dot** - “Sets all the text in a dot.”\n5. **Show Dot** - “Shows the specified dot.”\n\nThese comprehensively replace the functions of both Tot’s URL scheme and the available macOS script, adding significant functionality on top. For one thing, `Add to Dot` is smart enough to automatically add a space before appending any content to the end of a Dot, unlike the URL scheme’s append function.\n\n## Shortcuts\n\nThe first and most basic Siri Shortcuts I have to offer are [**Clear Dot**](https:\/\/routinehub.co\/shortcut\/11540) - which erases all contents from a Dot specified at run after one has confirmed with a [Show Alert](https:\/\/www.matthewcassinelli.com\/actions\/show-alert) action - and [**Tot ⇨ Apple Notes**](https:\/\/routinehub.co\/shortcut\/11500) which simply transfers the current contents of all 7 Tot Dots to individual Apple Notes per each. If you’d like to transfer content in the other direction, using `Send a Copy` in the pre-sharesheet from Apple Notes and then selecting Tot’s icon seems to do so fairly reliably:\n\n![Apple Note Shared to Tot](https:\/\/user-images.githubusercontent.com\/43663476\/162532529-d273a9bf-2aca-4961-82e8-6d3ee8bf54fa.png)\n\nNext is [**Tot Jar**](https:\/\/routinehub.co\/shortcut\/11456), which uses the `Query Dot` action to store the full JSON data of all 7 dots in individual key paths within a single dictionary in [Data Jar](https:\/\/apps.apple.com\/us\/app\/data-jar\/id1453273600).\n\n![Tot Jar Result](https:\/\/user-images.githubusercontent.com\/43663476\/162535816-e3fb6862-8ffd-4071-a2a7-db3681eac79c.png)\n\n[**Hot Tot Dot Swap**](https:\/\/routinehub.co\/shortcut\/11457) - undoubtedly my best-titled Shortcut, yet - allows one to reliably swap the contents of two Tot Dots. [**Dot Info**](https:\/\/routinehub.co\/shortcut\/11459) prompts you to select a Dot and then displays all available information about it that is *not* content. It will then ask if you’d like to append said info to the Dot, itself, in this format:\n\n![Dot Info Result](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/n5TgXpPB.png)\n\n[**Dots Summary**](https:\/\/routinehub.co\/shortcut\/11542) sums up the line, word, and character counts for all 7 Tot Dots, combined. It, too, will offer to append the result to a Dot of your choosing.\n\n![Tot-Titled Link from Sharesheet](https:\/\/user-images.githubusercontent.com\/43663476\/162573783-77a10c20-028f-4ceb-a130-63849c93f499.png)\n\nOne of Tot’s existing less-than-obvious capabilities, *titled* links can be appended from the share sheet in Safari as shown in the screenshot embedded above, but my [**Markdown Link ⇨ Dot**](https:\/\/routinehub.co\/shortcut\/11504\/) shortcut goes a step further, formatting the titled link as a markdown list item (`-`).   The [video demo](https:\/\/user-images.githubusercontent.com\/43663476\/161469532-7c3c55b7-1bc6-44df-a0b1-561923c2c36a.MOV) embedded below makes this process feel a lot more sluggish than it practically is, especially if you prioritize the shortcut in your own sharesheet list.\n\n<video controls>\n  <source src=\"https:\/\/user-images.githubusercontent.com\/43663476\/161469532-7c3c55b7-1bc6-44df-a0b1-561923c2c36a.MOV\">\n<\/video>\n\n[**Reminders List ⇨ Tot**](https:\/\/routinehub.co\/shortcut\/11539) is, by default, an extremely verbose method of itemizing the whole of a given list in Apple Reminders in a Tot Dot, complete with URL scheme-enabled links, tags, dates, notes, and URLs. Here’s the format in full, spacing included:\n\n```\n**[Title](URL)**\n`Tags`\n[Link](URL)\nCreated: Creation Date\nDue: Due Date\n\nNotes\n\n```\n\nHopefully it isn’t obvious, but this is perhaps the only shortcut shared in this Post for which I don’t personally have a use, but I can imagine an especially lengthy list transforming into a somewhat more visually-digestible view via a modified version with all but the markdown-formatted title link omitted. Here’s an example result out of the box:\n\n![Reminders to Tot

mp3 player was [**a first-generation iPod Shuffle**](https:\/\/everymac.com\/systems\/apple\/ipod\/specs\/ipod_shuffle.html) - which was not only the most elegant looking USB drive one could find at the time, but - imo - remains the single highest-value mainstream consumer tech product I’ve ever owned. It was a 512mb stick with playback controls and a 3.5mm audio jack at one end. From what I remember, you could just freely store any combination of non-media files and media files in the root separated by a single directory. I was in 5th grade (11 years old) at the time (2005,) and public schools were just beginning to suggest students invest in a flash drive for carrying\/storing digital school assignments. \n\nI say highest value because got dang was that thing handy. Idk if I can communicate it, really, but it unified so many functions into one very high quality (and extremely tough) device. (I accidentally put it through the wash at least 3 separate times and it never actually stopped working.) It even came with a lanyard attachment! \n\nIdk if there’s something wrong with me or what but I’m especially sentimental about this thing because I remember wholeheartedly believing and anticipating tech to progress along these lines - design priorities that especially made sense to me. Clever, lean permutations\/amalgamations of once single-function products.... \n\nI took that photo during a tech podcast years ago - I was doing this same anecdote lol.

The ideological one, in particular, is absolutely smelly with foot-to-foot-shuffling liberals, and they've had their palms facing a very particular fire for over a decade, now.\r\n\r\nIt's called True\/False, and it must be the least famous most prestigious film festival in the world. In a local radio interview, co-creator David Wilson (who stopped by my house for dinner once, I think) claimed that 50,000 people showed up last year, but I can't imagine where they all slept. Perhaps on air mattresses in the back of their Subaru wagons. No, I have no use for cheap jokes anymore. (The Murano CrossCabriolet is the official vehicle of this godforsaken place, anyway.)\r\n\r\nLet's just say that the population is halving-again around me as I write you, at least. It's not unreasonable to bet on an even more substantial turnout this year, given Tump's fundamentally anti-Columbian vocabulary, and well... the title of True\/False.\r\n\r\nThe latest joke I've been tossing around is that this publication's primary coverage to date has actually been of my own emotional development. If this \"true\" from your perspective, I'm not particularly bothered. Reflection may not be New, but I think - and hope - it can be helpful in mitigating contradictions, discrepancies  and other species of obstacle in your own life.\r\n\r\n## A Confession\r\n\r\nI fell asleep for the entirety of the last True\/False screening I attended.\r\n\r\nIt was a film about the story of a young woman's flight from an abusive household. Or at least... something like that. I'd skipped sleeping the night before and found myself struggling to keep my eyes open just minutes after the lights had dimmed. \r\n\r\nAnd I didn't return to consciousness until they brightened again as the applause faded in and the occupant of the seat immediately to my left stood up, alone, and made her way to the stage. I'd slept through every frame of the documentary of which she was the subject, right next to her.\r\n\r\nGuilt is one of those motivators that possess truly gargantuan, universal power over human beings. I decided that the culture and I were toxic for each other, and haven't been back, since. (I think that was 2015.)\r\n\r\nIt's day #1 of screenings, and I haven't slept, but I have every intention of introducing myself to my immediate fellow audience to confirm their lack of involvement in the production of the film, should I begin to lose gumption again.\r\n\r\nAmongst the Real Magazine Boys, there is a culture of silence regarding day-to-day operations, personal career stories, and industry meta, in general, because their experiences with absurdly low wages and salaries learns them a mean greed of their words (and information, in general,) as they accumulate over time. It may be gluttony, but it is simply a law of nature in the exposure-bound servitude of the ad model.\r\n\r\nExtratone's advertising chastity means that we are free to develop our own system of self-appraisal, and if our innocuous little website really is covering my late maturation, it is also covering itself, so it's worth noting that we have been given a media pass to this year's event, as much as I wanted to play it cool.\r\n\r\nTechnically, it's the first press credential of this - my nine-month-old Online son, and I am very proud. It's a big deal; True\/False attendance can cost hundreds or thousands of dollars, and we get to send one body for nothing at all. To be honest, contacting the press office did not occur to me until a week ago, so I certainly didn't expect anything more than policy documents, but I received An Email just hours after my request.\r\n\r\nI've already overlapped too much with this month's (upcoming) Editor's Letter, I'm sure, so I'll do my best to minimize transparency this weekend as much as I can. \r\n\r\nTrue\/False's particular nature does not lend toward any sort of live coverage or urgent correspondence, and neither do we. But we are counterculture, so I'm going to brew up a liveblog dedicated to conversations overheard while queuing, and may continue this sort of unrevised \"blogging\" nonsense as my attendance progresses, depending on how bored I am.\r\n\r\nThe asses of Ben Stokes and Leo Marx have the pick of the lot over my own, which should be exciting news, given their unique perspectives on film and culture, respectively. I've been trying to convince Tim to wear his pink suit to the thing - especially the \"VR Arcade.\" Do me a favor and bother his Twitter about it.\r\n\r\nWhen neither are available though, I will be making every possible use of this privilege, even though my net worth is currently nill, so I may actually end up needed to keep a fucking loaf of bread in my car.","views":126,"updated":"2022-05-21T02:50:22Z","tags":["FFF","FFFFFF","F4F4F4","3897f0","f4f4f4","c9c8cd"],"type":null,"title":"Cracker Barrel Crucifixion - Extratone Archive\r","slug":"cracker-barrel-crucifixion-extratone-archive","appearance":"sans","language":"en","rtl":false,"created":"2022-05-21T02:50:22Z","paid":false},{"id":"ms1v4xyannlhg37r","body":"# Retrieve Live NPR Program Information with Siri Shortcuts\n- [GitHub Issue](https:\/\/github.com\/extratone\/bilge\/issues\/331)\n- [Notes - Retrieve Live NPR Program Information with Siri Shortcuts](drafts:\/\/open?uuid=32965B91-A784-4651-9F9E-EE02C9548DE2)\n- [WTF](https:\/\/davidblue.wtf\/drafts\/FC5D51EA-5AF1-45E2-8E4B-2313AF84C31D.html)\n\n![What's on NPR?

One of [its winners](https:\/\/www.macstories.net\/stories\/introducing-the-2022-automation-april-shortcuts-contest-winners) - a shortcut called \"[What's on KUTX](https:\/\/www.icloud.com\/shortcuts\/68b1d8edadb9446599c90d988ef21eb3)?\" credited to Jack Wellborn - caught my eye as a lifelong dependent upon National Public Radio. Via [John Voorhees' comment](https:\/\/www.macstories.net\/stories\/introducing-the-2022-automation-april-shortcuts-contest-winners\/#whats-on-kutx-a-music-discovery-shortcut):\n\n> The solution Wellborn came up with is ingenious.

If you're unfamiliar, [here's a handy guide](https:\/\/balsamiq.com\/support\/faqs\/browserconsole\/) to doing so on some popular desktop web browsers.\n\n<center><a href=\"https:\/\/apps.apple.com\/us\/app\/web-inspector\/id1584825745\"><img src=\"https:\/\/i.snap.as\/6dahYnnY.png\" alt=\"Web Inspector\" width=\"30%\"><\/img><\/a><\/center>\n\nHonestly, though, if you're already on your iOS\/iPadOS device and you're willing to install a single, free Safari Extension, I believe you'll find [Web Inspector](https:\/\/apps.apple.com\/us\/app\/web-inspector\/id1584825745) to be the single, simplest method of retrieving your station's UCSID.\n\n![Finding UCSID-Web Inspector](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/r1VgmbNv.png)\n\n### Finding your station's UCSID with Web Inspector\n\n1. Navigate to your station's homepage (ex. `kbia.org`.)\n2. Start playback of the live stream you'd like to query (may or may not be necessary, depending.)\n3. Open Web Inspector via the [Safari Extensions Menu](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/2632HFBC.png).\n4. In the `DOM` tab, use the search icon to filter for `ucsid`.\n5. Your station's UCSID is the value for the `data-stream-ucsid` field.\n\nDepending on how modern your station's website is (I think - I'm supposing, here,) you may or may not find this field. For reference, [here is the HTML source of KBIA's webpage](https:\/\/tilde.town\/~extratone\/shortcuts\/kbia\/example.txt) from which I drew in its entirety. If you're having trouble, please feel free to [contact me](https:\/\/davidblue.wtf\/db.vcf) however you wish, ideally with your preferred station's identifier\/web url.\n\n<center><a href=\"https:\/\/apps.apple.com\/us\/app\/broadcasts\/id1469995354\"><img src=\"https:\/\/i.snap.as\/e68mJ9cQ.png\" alt=\"Broadcasts\" width=\"30%\"><\/img><\/a><\/center>\n\n### \"Integration\" with the Broadcasts app\n\n[**Broadcasts**](https:\/\/apps.apple.com\/us\/app\/broadcasts\/id1469995354) is a very popular and highly-praised universal Apple application for internet radio streaming. By default, my What's on NPR? shortcut includes an action to begin streaming a station in Broadcasts, but it requires further configuration.\n\n![Broadcasts App Integration](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/eTkiNc6O.png)\n\nIn all likelihood, a search of the [Broadcasts Directory](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/OvItUZSE.png) for your station's four-letter identifier should yield results. Once you've added your station to your library in Broadcasts, hold its icon (or `^ Tap`) to present the context menu (shown in the screenshots embedded above) and select `Edit`. The exact value for the `Name` field in configuration menu that results must be supplied as the answer to the second configuration step of my What's on NPR? shortcut. If you do not wish to use Broadcasts, you need only delete or replace its single action in the shortcut's default configuration.\n\nIf you've followed along this far, you now have both values you're prompted for at installation of said shortcut, by default: your station's `ucsid` and its name in the Broadcasts app. You need only continue if you'd prefer to add options for [Apple Music](https:\/\/apps.apple.com\/us\/app\/apple-music\/id1108187390) and\/or [VLC](https:\/\/apps.apple.com\/us\/app\/vlc-media-player\/id650377962).\n\n![Finding an NPR Station's Apple Music URL](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/jeNMtNgs.png)\n\n### \"Integration\" with Apple Music\n\nIf you'd like to have a menu option to begin streaming your NPR station in Apple Music, begin by searching within the app for your station's identifier (as shown in the screenshot embedded above.) Use the triple-dot menu's `Share Station` option to copy its Apple Music URL. (WBEZ's, for example, is `https:\/\/music.apple.com\/us\/station\/npr-news-wbez-chicago\/ra.872998937`.) Replace or append to the Broadcasts option with a menu option pointing to an [Open URLs](https:\/\/www.matthewcassinelli.com\/actions\/open-urls\/) action containing the resulting URL. (Refer to [my What's on KBIA? shortcut](https:\/\/www.icloud.com\/shortcuts\/04ec61d2f057497bba899eb434b3da07) to see this implemented.)\n\n<center><a href=\"https:\/\/apps.apple.com\/us\/app\/vlc-media-player\/id650377962\"><img src=\"https:\/\/i.snap.as\/RZYRoIw8.png\" alt=\"VLC\" width=\"30%\"><\/img><\/a><\/center>\n\n### \"Integration\" with VLC media player\n\nThe [**VLC media player**](https:\/\/apps.apple.com\/us\/app\/vlc-media-player\/id650377962) iOS app does not yet have its own Siri Shortcuts actions, but it *does* have a handy URL scheme which allows one to stream or download the contents of any raw media URL. Using Web Inspector as described above, I was able to find the raw stream URL for KBIA (`https:\/\/playerservices.streamtheworld.com\/api\/livestream-redirect\/KBIAFM.mp3`) quite quickly in the `Resources` tab whilst streaming live.\n\n![Finding Raw Stream URL-Web Inspector](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/R5o3kda5.png)\n\nTo add an option to my shortcut to open the stream in VLC, I would add the following value in an Open URLs action: \n\n```\nvlc-x-callback:\/\/x-callback-url\/stream?url=https:\/\/playerservices.streamtheworld.com\/api\/livestream-redirect\/KBIAFM.mp3\n```\n\nOnce again, if you have any trouble configuring What's on NPR? - whether that be with finding your station's UCSID and\/or \"integrating\" playback with another app, please do [reach

If not, replace with widgets? ANSWER: TOT WORKS - See [Twitter Video](https:\/\/twitter.com\/NeoYokel\/status\/1538105518882963459)\n- [ ] Swift Playgrounds\n\n### Bad Ideas List\n\n- Assess how difficult it would actually be to build a simple application in Swift Playgrounds to act as the keyboard shortcuts guide for iPhone. See: [KeyboardKit](https:\/\/github.com\/KeyboardKit\/KeyboardKit) - [Tweet](https:\/\/twitter.com\/NeoYokel\/status\/1534133062715547648)\n\n## Hardware Notes\n\n- Default, in-box charger struggling to keep up regardless of whether or not it's plugged directly into the device or into the Magic Keyboard Fucker Stand\n- Turns out, the Magic Keyboard Fucker Stand does not seem to mean I would no longer need my iPhone Suspension Hell Tripod Contraption, but rather that I need a MUCH more stout one.\n- Inevitably, one of the biggest components of the iPad Pro's overwhelming power in *my* life (probably *the* biggest, realistically,) is what it reveals of the operating system that is truly broken and what obstacles are literally just a resource issue that need only require brute Booty.\n- THE BLACKS. (In the display.) You know me to be a superficial user but my god!\n- I can almost see how one needn't miss the function keys, but *I* continuously encountered situations (which I'd before configured myself into with set keyboard shortcuts on iPhone) where I did not know how to proceed without keys missing from my Full Beauty Board. I love page up and down! Home and end! I don't want to fucking *read* a webpage, I just want to see the top or the bottom!\n\n## General Software Notes\n\n- The background persistence really is uncanny... like stumbling upon the fact that I was still logged in to TildeTown IRC in Blink (mosh tho) after like TWO DAYS without opening  Blink even though I had *not* enabled `geo track`.\n- Put simply, this device (versus any iPhone) makes Safari's native Reading List\/Bookmarks functionalities *actually worthwile to use*.\n- There are glimpses of desktop-like window management throughout iPadOS (yet another one is coming with Stage Manager in iPadOS 16,) but frankly - as someone who has used this operating system very extensively under the assumption I would never have to deal with windowing - they have all come across as awkward and problematic. The funniest one - I was wondering why multiple windows kept showing up for Mail - just like its macOS counterpart, Mail's behavior when it comes to open new drafts is baffling and problematic.\n- On that windowing note, I frankly like Drafts' tried and true solutions addressing the single-window-only limitations of before (callable sidebars, fixed toolbars) *far* more than how it behaves in Split View. Again, I'm sure I could configure my way out of this, but fuck.\n\n## General Keyboarding Notes\n\n- I must confesss, I was *completely unaware* of the existence of iPadOS' \"Floating Keyboard\" view and when I inexplicably managed to trigger it for the fist time, I was treated to a pretty severe laughing fit because... well.\n\n---\n\n## Questions Answered\n\n- [ ] *Does iPad\/iPadOS respond to multiple connected keyboards at once?* - Yes! Thank God.\n\n---\n\n## Videos\n\n- [Tot Works!!

managed to turn the concept of using an external keyboard with one's handset into a quasi-political, emotionally-charged issue. Corresponding with this doctrine was a specific narrative regarding the iPad Pro's introduction, symbolic of iPadOS' split from iOS, taking virtually all public-facing documentation of Bluetooth keyboard support with it. I even went so far as to describe it as a \"[class issue](https:\/\/whyp.it\/t\/the-iphone-x-bluetooth-keyboard-issue-is-a-class-issue-45467¸).\" In my defense, I was bitching under the assumption that greater attention from Apple, Inc. devoted to hardware keyboard support on the iPad would be to its *benefit*. Compared to the current state of said support on *iPhone*, the truth is... much more complicated. We'll get there, eventually.\n\nMy boss and mother has run her private therapy practice entirely on her iPhone and MacBook Pro for years, now, but the latter - a 15-inch, mid-2015 model - saw its last supported named macOS update in Monterey.

You can download our [iOS app](https:\/\/itunes.apple.com\/app\/id972909677) today to start exploring.\n\nJust over a year ago, we became fascinated by the idea of discovering the world through someone else’s eyes. What if you could see through the eyes of a protester in Ukraine? Or watch the sunrise from a hot air balloon in Cappadocia? It may sound crazy, but we wanted to build the closest thing to teleportation. While there are many ways to discover events and places, we realized there is no better way to experience a place ***right now*** than through live video. A picture may be worth a thousand words, but live video can take you someplace and show you around.\n\n![You can title your broadcasts as well as allowing only those you choose to view it](https:\/\/periscope.neocities.org\/blog\/assets\/1-4YJGSEXeDu8w6mUzj-AaGw.png)\n\n**For broadcasters**, Periscope lets you share an experience with others. Press a button, and instantly notify your followers that you’re live. Whether you’re witnessing your daughter’s first steps or a newsworthy event, Periscope offers an audience and the power of a shared experience. Most mobile broadcasting tools feel far from live. Broadcasters on Periscope are directly connected to their audience, able to feel their presence and interact. Going live on Periscope means more than a blinking red dot.\n\n**For viewers**, Periscope gives you a new set of eyes and ears. Travel the world and step into someone else’s shoes. See what they see, hear what they hear, and hopefully feel what they feel. Watching a broadcast isn’t a passive experience like television. On Periscope, viewers influence the broadcaster by sending messages, and expressing their love by tapping the screen to send hearts.\n\n![You can tap the video while watching to send a heart color coded to you.](https:\/\/periscope.neocities.org\/blog\/assets\/1-J0sft7kcI_QHn3Wet1z9WQ.gif)\n\nWhat excites us most about Periscope is the power of seeing something for yourself. We watched someone rise above the Sonoma valley in a hot air balloon; we witnessed “Hands Up Don’t Shoot” directly from Ferguson, Missouri, a terrifying fire that erupted in San Francisco’s Mission district and a live performance from a pianist who played any song requested from the audience.\n\n>> “a visual pulse of what’s happening **right now**”\n\nWe’ve always imagined Periscope as a visual pulse of what’s happening ***right now***. Our friends at Twitter felt the same way, and in January [we decided](https:\/\/twitter.com\/periscopeco\/status\/576429747057504257) to work towards this vision together. We’ll continue building Periscope as a separate product, with a small team based in San Francisco. Twitter brings you closer to people, places, interests, and events in an experience that’s immediate, unfettered, and conversational. We think Periscope can help further that mission by giving people a way to share and experience the world around them, both near and far.\n\nWe are thrilled to share Periscope with you. And even more excited to see how you will use it.\n\n[Download the iOS App](https:\/\/itunes.apple.com\/app\/id972909677)\n\n\n- - - -\nurl: https:\/\/medium.com\/periscope\/last-month-in-periscope-9e6115eb2dfa\ntitle: Last Month in Periscope\nsubtitle: The last month in Periscope has been incredible.

We are continually amazed, and thankful to broadcasters around the world for bringing us to places we have never been before. The world of Periscope is exciting and often surprising. In the last month we celebrated with you, traveled across the globe, and sat patiently, watching newsworthy events unfold in front of our eyes. We wanted to share some of our favorite moments.\n\nThis week [Coleen Baik](https:\/\/twitter.com\/colbay) with the [Women Cross DMZ](https:\/\/twitter.com\/womencrossdmz) peace movement took us inside North Korea.

We’ve also seen broadcasters get discovered and quickly grow a large, public following. But with this openness comes an increased risk for spam and abuse, and this is something that we take seriously.\n\nAbove all, we want our community to be safe on Periscope. Comments are a vital part of the experience and we’ve been working hard on a system that still feels true to the live and unfiltered nature of our platform. Specifically, we want to develop a system that is:\n\n* **Transparent**:** **People should clearly understand how comments are being moderated.\n\n* **Community-led**: People in a broadcast are best suited to determine what’s okay and what’s not. Context matters — for example, a comment that might be okay in a comedy broadcast might not be okay somewhere else.\n\n* **Live**: Because Periscope is real-time, people should be able to report and moderate comments as they appear on the screen.\n\nToday, we’re rolling out a comment moderation system that empowers our community to report and vote on comments that they consider to be spam or abuse.\n\n__gfycat__:\n[![gfycat](https:\/\/thumbs.gfycat.com\/IllCautiousGroundhog-poster.jpg)](https:\/\/thumbs.gfycat.com\/IllCautiousGroundhog-mobile.mp4)\n\nHere’s how it works:\n\n1. During a broadcast, viewers can **report comments as spam or abuse**. The viewer that reports the comment will no longer see messages from that commenter for the remainder of the broadcast. The system may also identify commonly reported phrases.\n\n1. When a comment is reported, **a few viewers are randomly selected** to vote on whether they think the comment is spam, abuse, or looks okay.\n\n1. The result of the vote is shown to voters. If the majority votes that the comment is spam or abuse, the commenter will be notified that their ability to chat in the broadcast has been temporarily disabled. Repeat offenses will result in chat being disabled for that commenter for the remainder of the broadcast.\n\nWe’ve designed this system to be very lightweight — the entire process above should last just a matter of seconds. That said, if people don’t want to participate, broadcasters can elect to not have their broadcasts moderated, and viewers can opt out of voting from their Settings.\n\nThis system works in tandem with other tools that we have in place for our community. You can still [report ongoing harassment or abuse](https:\/\/help.periscope.tv\/customer\/portal\/articles\/2313190), [block and remove people from your broadcasts](https:\/\/help.periscope.tv\/customer\/portal\/articles\/2016653), and [restrict comments to people you know](https:\/\/help.periscope.tv\/customer\/portal\/articles\/2051924).\n\nThere are no silver bullets, but we’re committed to developing tools to keep Periscope a safe and open place for people to connect in real-time. We look forward to working closely with you and everyone else in the community to improve comment moderation.\n\nTo learn more, visit our [Help Center](https:\/\/help.periscope.tv\/customer\/portal\/articles\/2442663).\n\nMuch Love,\nTeam Periscope\n\n**Downloads\n**[Press Assets](https:\/\/www.dropbox.com\/sh\/mt86qvfyz8vb930\/AAALSkbfwO1N50thksVH4xbba?dl=0)\n\n\n- - - -\nurl: https:\/\/medium.com\/@Mancerrss\/hey-cool-but-i-wanna-ask-are-you-guys-gonna-start-supporting-3rd-party-handheld-360-cameras-like-b507e5cfbd47\ntitle: Hey cool.

We launched Periscope just four months ago, on March 26, 2015. We would like to thank every single one of you for taking the time to use something that we’ve worked so hard to create. It means everything to us.\n\n![](https:\/\/periscope.neocities.org\/blog\/assets\/1-Zd4LbD1T1dKRgV_NsNZ7Iw.png)\n\nWe’re even more stunned by the burgeoning usage of Periscope. Here’s the graph of our **Time Watched** since launching. We define Time Watched as the aggregate amount of time that people spend **watching live** **broadcasts** on iOS & Android. As of last week, we’re seeing over **40 years of video watched per day**.\n\n![Time Watched represents the total amount of time (in years \/ day) spent watching live broadcasts on iOS & Android. Does not include time watching on the Web or replays.](https:\/\/periscope.neocities.org\/blog\/assets\/1-Vr993M2wiOqOzcgAXAqIgQ.png)\n\nTime Watched is the metric we care about most, and what we’ll keep you updated on periodically. Here’s why Time Watched matters to us:\n\n* **It’s most reflective of the value we’re creating for people and the world**. Success for **broadcasters** means more time watched on their broadcasts. Success for the **audience** (viewers who are watching and participating in a Periscope) means more high quality broadcasts in their feeds that they want to watch and participate in. Success for broadcasters and their audience means success for Periscope.\n\n* **Time Watched is also valuable because it can capture viewership of Periscope broadcasts outside of iOS\/Android.** We have huge viewership on periscope.tv and this matters — especially to our broadcasters who get incredible reach and audience because of it. At the moment, we don’t include time watched from periscope.tv in our overall Time Watched metric — but we’re working on being able to track this precisely enough to share.\n\n* **Time Watched **serves as a proxy for active user growth, without suffering some of the limitations of focusing exclusively on a metric like Daily Active Users (DAU) or Monthly Active Users (MAU). Although it’s useful for us to see that our DAU graph is trending upwards (see below), we don’t think it’s the most important metric for assessing our overall success.\n\n![DAU represents Periscope iOS & Android only. Doesn’t include periscope.tv web viewers.](https:\/\/periscope.neocities.org\/blog\/assets\/1-oKj4hwRlWPQDozJMLAMYeg.png)\n\nOptimizing for DAU\/MAU doesn’t properly motivate our team to create a product that people love. Here’s why: if we were motivated to grow DAU, we’d be incentivized to invest in a host of conventional growth hacks, viral mechanics, and marketing to drive up downloads. This direction doesn’t necessarily lead to a better product, or lead to success for Periscopers. We hold ourselves accountable to Time Watched as an organizational measure because it reflects the kernel of our product, and our core values.\n\nWe hope this was helpful information to share. Most importantly, we want Periscopers to know and feel that they’re contributing to a growing ecosystem. And we want people to know that the Periscope team is measuring itself in a way that aligns with the value that the community gets from Periscope. We will continue to be transparent about what we think and why, and you should hold us to that. If there are other areas of our product or focus that we should be more transparent about, please tell us!\n\nThank you\n\nKayvon, Joe, and the Periscope team\n\n\n- - - -\nurl: https:\/\/medium.com\/periscope\/rewind-february-2017-999bb9bb49c4\ntitle: Rewind: February 2017\nsubtitle: The past is never dead.

We just shipped an update to the app ([download here](https:\/\/itunes.apple.com\/app\/id972909677)) with a handful of changes and more to come:\n\n* ***“Woah with the notifications!” ***We hear you, it can get noisy. We switched the default setting off for follower notifications and know we need to make the overall controls here more granular. We’re on it.\n\n* ***“It’s hard to sift through the live feeds.”*** Totally, we agree. As of our latest iOS 1.0.1 update, live broadcasts from people you follow will always be at the top. We’re also introducing a ‘Featured’ section to highlight unique content.\n\n* ***“The location sharing is too revealing.” ***You don’t have to share your location publicly and can turn this feature off anytime before broadcasting. But, when you do choose to show your location, we’ve changed the map display so it’s further zoomed out and less precise (in the latest 1.0.1 version).\n\n* ***“My broadcasts aren’t being tweeted”*** [Try this](https:\/\/help.periscope.tv\/customer\/portal\/articles\/2017798).\n\n* ***“When is Android coming?”*** Soon!

Orson Welles tried the apéritif in Rome while filming *Black Magic,* a now-obscure picture adapted from an Alexandre Dumas novel about a hypnotist who chooses the dark side. “The bitters are excellent for your liver, the gin is bad for you,” he wrote in a letter to a newspaper back home. “They balance each other.”\n\nThe Negroni is now recognized as a cocktail classic, and fans will find an excellent how-to below from celeb chef Scott Conant.

We’ve been blown away by what the Periscope community has created in such a short time. In the end of May, we announced that in aggregate users spend 10 years worth of time watching broadcasts live each day on Periscope. Today, we’re excited to share that this has increased to over 25 years of live watched time every day!\n\n>> “…over 25 years of live watched time every day…”\n\nA new [update is now available](https:\/\/itunes.apple.com\/us\/app\/periscope\/id972909677?mt=8) on iOS in the App Store with some great new goodies, so we wanted to share a bit more here on what we launched, and why:\n\n![](https:\/\/periscope.neocities.org\/blog\/assets\/1-nikecGBT63ZVEG1ivGmTJA.gif)\n\n### Notification Mute\n\nThere’s now a “Mute” option for every user you follow on Periscope. When you mute someone, their broadcasts still appear in your feed, but you won’t receive push notifications when they go live. Push notifications are a powerful communication channel, but they also have the potential of creating a frustrating degree of noise for users. We think it’s important to respect this power, and give users granular control over the notifications they receive while still providing the flexibility of seeing more content on Periscope. This is coming to Android imminently!\n\n![](https:\/\/periscope.neocities.org\/blog\/assets\/1-xhV2j6xBpH2TmeYtAQHyVw.jpeg)\n\n### A Better Global Feed\n\nThe global feed allows you to discover interesting content from people around the globe. We believe it is one of the best discovery tools viewers have on Periscope. We’ve refreshed this feed (on iOS and Android) to surface high quality broadcasts that you’re likely to enjoy. In your profile settings, you can now also indicate your language preferences. This impacts the broadcasts in your Global feed (by default, we will select your device’s preferred languages). We hope this update makes it easier to find the most interesting broadcasts on Periscope.\n\n### **Your Broadcast Stats**\n\nAt the end of the broadcast, a panel pops up that tells you a few things about your broadcast (including **total time watched**). Previously, this information was only visible immediately after stopping your broadcast. Now, when viewing your past broadcasts, broadcast statistics will always be available.\n\n![](https:\/\/periscope.neocities.org\/blog\/assets\/1-AgabM-LSHxUZA1kZQWjk7A.jpeg)\n\n### iOS 8 Handoff\n\nYou can start watching a broadcast on one device, and transition to watching it on another seamlessly. Simply ensure both are running iOS 8+ or OS X, have Bluetooth turned on, and are logged in to the same iCloud account. This is great for when you’re watching a broadcast on your Desktop, and want to quickly switch to watching on your iOS device (or vica versa).\n\nEnjoy the new features, and thank you for continuing to make Periscope a wonderful platform for communication and expression. Please don’t hesitate to reach out to us [@periscopeco](https:\/\/twitter.com\/periscopeco) for any thoughts\/suggestions\/questions.\n\nCheers\n\nTeam Periscope\n\n\n- - - -\nurl: https:\/\/medium.com\/periscope\/around-the-world-in-one-day-1ffe3dda1226\ntitle: Around the World in One Day\nsubtitle: This weekend, more than 50 broadcasters organized a Scope Day that took audiences around the globe.

In what seemed to be a divided world, particularly here in America, Periscope gave me an additional platform to speak to fellow Americans, as well as people across the world, to educate and break some of the myths creating division among different groups. I felt that as a proud Muslim American U.S. Marine I was in a unique position to help.\n\n**What’s been your most interesting experience that you’ve shared on Periscope?**\n\nI’d say the coolest thing has been the ability to connect with people from all walks of life. Some of these people I’ve had the opportunity to actually meet in person or talk with on the phone. I’m sure some of these people will be friends for life.\n\n![](https:\/\/periscope.neocities.org\/blog\/assets\/1-A-BuRG6EF2HoCxbjw2T97w.jpeg)\n\n**What’s on your bucket list of things to broadcast?**\n\nI’m brainstorming a potential nationwide tour of as many states as possible with my sign, “I’m a Muslim AND a U.S. Marine, ask me anything.” Of course I’d like to bring my Periscope audience along as part of the ride. In addition, I’m involved with other speaking engagements which I would also like to share with the Periscope family.\n\n**Who are three of your favorite broadcasters we should follow today?**\n\nThree of my favorite broadcasters are as follows: Muslim Imam [@Rizwan1770](https:\/\/www.periscope.tv\/Rizwan1770), America’s Muslim [@Harris_Zafar,](https:\/\/www.periscope.tv\/Harris_Zafar) and Muslim Bodybuilder [@TariqHMalik](https:\/\/www.periscope.tv\/TariqHMalik1).\n\n![](https:\/\/periscope.neocities.org\/blog\/assets\/1--gKg7H0LjV2jOo9pFyZUIw.jpeg)\n\n\n- - - -\nurl: https:\/\/medium.com\/periscope\/skip-around-the-world-bd419f1ade3b\ntitle: Skip Around The World\nsubtitle: We’re excited to announce two major updates to Periscope on iOS and Android: a revamped Global Map, and Skip Ahead on replays!\nslug: skip-around-the-world\ndescription: \ntags: periscope,social-media,tech\nauthor: Periscope\nusername: periscope\n- - - -\n\n![](https:\/\/periscope.neocities.org\/blog\/assets\/1-U1AFnYSju5BHeqU8l4V_ww.jpeg)\n\n# Skip Around The World\n\nWe’re excited to announce two major updates to Periscope on iOS and Android: a revamped **Global Map**, and **Skip Ahead on replays**!\n\n### Global Map\n\nWe’ve always thought that Periscope has the potential of showing you the world in real time. This vision inspired us to create the Global Map. Our first implementation, launched in June, had some limitations. The map only showed live broadcasts (no replays) and was limited to a total of 250 broadcasts. At any given point there are thousands of broadcasts live on Periscope and orders of magnitude more replays, so the Map was only showing the tip of the iceberg. The new map launching today has some major improvements.\n\n![](https:\/\/periscope.neocities.org\/blog\/assets\/1-sHW1DM9mYnkapZ0mHmL3Sg.png)\n\nEvery time you zoom to a new place on the map, Periscope will reload broadcasts from this region, **including** replays from the last 24 hours. Red dots are live broadcasts, and blue dots are replays. You can look at the most remote area of the world and see both what’s happening now, and what’s happened recently.\n\nWhen we’ve heard about breaking news events, as in the case of Hurricane Patricia, we’ve found ourselves checking Periscope first.\n\nWe think that the new Map functionality is much closer to fulfilling our original vision of seeing the world in real time. We hope you agree!\n\n![](https:\/\/periscope.neocities.org\/blog\/assets\/1-RPJOA1_-vkxMgfT1WIxOKg.gif)\n\n### **Skip Ahead in Replays**\n\nWe know you’re busy. When you’re watching a replay, you sometimes just want to fast forward a segment and get to the part you’re looking for. Or to the moment your friend told you about. Or you just want to seek through the whole thing quickly to get an idea of what happened. Now you can. Just press down while watching the replay, and drag left and right. You can even drag up and down to change the seek speed. And while you’re seeking, with your finger still pressed down, you’ll see a preview of that moment in the broadcast.\n\n### **3D Touch Shortcuts**\n\nFor iPhone 6s and 6s+ owners, we’ve added a few handy shortcuts. If you press down on the Periscope app icon, you’ll have the following options:\n\n![](https:\/\/periscope.neocities.org\/blog\/assets\/1-XuMkx0SiE--ewKuDosuZHg.png)\n\n* **Search People** — Pretty self explanatory!\n\n* **Teleport** — Takes you someplace random in the world and shows you a live broadcast from there. We love this shortcut because we’ve always wanted Periscope to feel like teleportation.\n\n* **Broadcast Mutuals **— Starts a private broadcast that only your mutual followers see (people you follow, who also follow you).

We wanted to be able to see anywhere in the world, but questioned whether we would have enough broadcasts for a map to be compelling. *“What are the odds that anyone would even be live?”* we asked ourselves. So we shelved the map, and promised to revisit the idea when it made more sense.\n\nWe could never have predicted the volume of broadcasts happening across the world. We believe the incredible Periscope community has now made that original vision possible, which inspired us to release today’s [iOS update](https:\/\/itunes.apple.com\/us\/app\/periscope\/id972909677?mt=8):\n\n__vimeo__:\n[![vimeo](http:\/\/i.vimeocdn.com\/video\/521326163_640.jpg)](https:\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/128546436)\nThank you to these Periscope users for allowing us to share their broadcasts: [@penguinsix](http:\/\/twitter.com\/penguinsix), [@danandmoore](http:\/\/twitter.com\/danandmoore), [@sky1ron](http:\/\/twitter.com\/sky1ron), [@valaafshar](http:\/\/twitter.com\/valaafshar), [@nicholasgarnett](http:\/\/twitter.com\/nicholasgarnett), [@abhishekscariya](http:\/\/twitter.com\/abhishekscariya), [@colbay](http:\/\/twitter.com\/colbay), [@lidiaschillaci](http:\/\/twitter.com\/lidiaschillaci), [@cailinoneil](http:\/\/twitter.com\/cailinoneil), [@mweasner](http:\/\/twitter.com\/mweasner), [@everydaydude](http:\/\/twitter.com\/everydaydude), [@danandmoore](http:\/\/twitter.com\/danandmoore), [@euromaestro](http:\/\/twitter.com\/euromaestro), [@revbeej](http:\/\/twitter.com\/revbeej), [@bohan](http:\/\/twitter.com\/bohan), [@marloes](http:\/\/twitter.com\/marloes), [@glacierNPS](http:\/\/twitter.com\/glacierNPS), [@intothefuzz](http:\/\/twitter.com\/intothefuzz)\n\n### Map View\n\nWhen you tap on the ‘Global’ section, you will be able to explore live broadcasts on an interactive map.

We want to thank our incredible community for bringing us these moments, and many more.\n\nHappy New Year and Much Love, \nTeam Periscope\n\n![](https:\/\/periscope.neocities.org\/blog\/assets\/1-GdBtrh2BCR-y3ZnbC22f9g.jpeg)\n\n![](https:\/\/periscope.neocities.org\/blog\/assets\/1-s7AYF422MYc6SGANeg8ZUA.jpeg)\n\n# **“**Atop Hawk Hill” by [Couch](https:\/\/www.periscope.tv\/couch)\n\nI’ve enjoyed many broadcasts from locations near and far in my time at Periscope — from the first cross-country broadcast I watched Kayvon make from the Minneapolis Sculpture Garden that convinced me of the concept, to [PenguinSix](https:\/\/www.periscope.tv\/penguinsix)’s daily glimpses of his life in Hong Kong. Few broadcasts, however, have stuck with me as much as one made by our own Bill Couch. On the morning that we released Landscape to the general public, I awoke early and immediately opened Periscope hoping to find something to prove to myself that it was all working. By perfect coincidence I found a broadcast Bill had just published in my personal feed. I joined and was instantly greeted by a sublime sight: low-level fog stretching across the San Francisco Bay, with just the towers of the Golden Gate Bridge visible, seen from one of my favorite perspectives in the Marin Headlands. In that moment I knew we had finally made good on our shared dream of seeing the world through someone else’s eyes. No other broadcast quite reached the feeling of sharing another’s experience. I knew exactly where Bill stood, and experienced the world as he was experiencing it — all from the comfort of my bed.\n** — [Nils**](https:\/\/www.periscope.tv\/nils)\n\n![](https:\/\/periscope.neocities.org\/blog\/assets\/1-MIkZR2XDgcrNKK-LrFYX-w.png)\n\n# “Heavy rain, new boats arriving” by [Paul Ronzheimer](https:\/\/www.periscope.tv\/ronzheimer)\n\nWatching the Syrian refugee coverage on Periscope has been really moving for me. I was only a year old when my parents took me and my older sister (then 3) and fled a war torn Vietnam. Until recently, everything I knew and understood about the refugee experience was based solely on my parents’ stories, and reading and watching documentaries about the Vietnamese boat people.\n\nSeeing Syrian refugees share their story first hand, in real time, has been amazing and the periscopes that stand out the most to me are the ones where you see viewer perspectives changing to one of understanding and compassion.\n** — [Lien**](https:\/\/www.periscope.tv\/lientm)\n\n![](https:\/\/periscope.neocities.org\/blog\/assets\/1-JUcBHSVDhuQcEGvKh3Grew.jpeg)\n\n# “Birocratic — Live Beatmaking ＃BiroMakesABeat” by[ Birocratic](https:\/\/www.periscope.tv\/birocratic)\n\nBirocratic is a musician that I’ve discovered years ago. I love his music, and often have his Soundcloud channel on repeat while designing Periscope ;D. One day I was getting ready for work and got a push notification about his very first broadcast. I kind of lost it and squeeled through the toothpaste in my mouth (was brushing my teeth at the time). It was fascinating to see the creative process of an artist I admire, completely raw, and happening right at that moment before my eyes. All the struggles, repetitions, false starts, iterations, as well as the sheer joy and energy with which he brought the music I love into being made me not only appreciate his work that much more, but also connected me with him as a human being.\n** — [Veronika**](https:\/\/www.periscope.tv\/verohecko)\n\n__vine__:\n[![vine](https:\/\/v.cdn.vine.co\/r\/videos\/8F6F141A571272475843775856640_4ca76a6d44a.2.1.17229214269343117508.mp4.jpg?versionId=mUI7NluYgkvo.1DpNsQLavu8EUgYUwaY)](https:\/\/vine.co\/v\/e3nD73xH6hw\/embed\/simple)\n\n# **“Happy ＃Halloween from Sock Cop! I’m a Vampirate!” by [Sock Cop**](https:\/\/www.periscope.tv\/jasonburglar)\n\nA long long time ago in a galaxy far away I stumbled upon a talking sock… who apparently was a cop. Just like everyone else I thought “WTF?”. Quickly I was reassured by the talking sock that everything would be ok, that i should “ease into it like a hot bath”. And I did just that. Months later, dozens of late night broadcasts later, I tuned in for a ＃halloween extravaganza. The Sock decided to be a vampire and a pirate for halloween… if that wasn’t enough for you, he had a black light.\n** — [Tyler**](https:\/\/www.periscope.tv\/tyhan1)\n\n![](https:\/\/periscope.neocities.org\/blog\/assets\/1-ZUwxiBPS3CE8gbGAwDMgLA.png)\n\n# “Baltimore residents now — very moving” by[ Paul Lewis](https:\/\/www.periscope.tv\/paullewis)\n\nThe Baltimore riots broke less than one month after our launch in March. Coverage of the unrest was limited and we couldn’t get a real sense for what it was like to be in Baltimore. We fell into one of Paul’s broadcasts as he crossed the city, spoke with residents and gave context as events unfolded. This narrative opened his immediate reality to a dynamic, responsive audience. And he empowered this audience to witness and react to urgent and organic stories. It was powerful; these worlds were radically open and unfiltered.\n** —[ Alex**](https:\/\/www.periscope.tv\/alexk)\n\n# “On a ferry. There’s a really bad storm. I’m scared” by Unknown\n\nI’ll never forget this broadcast. I was flying from San Francisco to London and was wondering whether the WiFi was fast enough to make Periscope work. The lighting was dim on the plane since most passengers were sleeping. I was browsing the Map and found a broadcast that caught my eye for two reasons: 1) the title was dramatic and 2) the broadcaster was in the middle of the river (not often you see the red dot in the middle of a body of water. I joined along with 7 other people, watching this woman visibly and audibly terrified. Through her camera you could see the shadow of a ferry captain piloting the boat. You could hear terrential down pour and you could feel the boat rocking left to right through the violent storm. The broadcaster was breathing deeply. I found myself, along with everybody else in the broadcast, sending her comments saying “It’s going to be OK. We’re here with you. You’ll get to the other side soon”. I thought this broadcast was really powerful because it brought all of us together. As viewers, we wanted to help comfort this stranger. As a broadcast, she just wanted to share a scary experience with people because she had nobody to talk to.\n** — [Kayvon**](https:\/\/www.periscope.tv\/kayvon)\n\n[![Youtube](https:\/\/img.youtube.com\/vi\/Q3vE0xkyl0g\/hqdefault.jpg)](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Q3vE0xkyl0g)\n\n# “Watch me kill 🔪👣🎃#Halloween” by Blu[mhouse\n\nThis live horror production was such a unique application of Periscope, and I was really impressed by their production value. I really felt like the producers had reimagined their genre, and the incorporation of the audience only enhanced how scary the story was.\n** — [Aaron**](https:\/\/www.periscope.tv\/aw)\n\n# **“Bed Time Stories” by [Adam Yaffe**](https:\/\/www.periscope.tv\/@adamyaffe)\n\nI fell in love with Adam’s family. They are quirky, cheeky, laugh out loud funny, kind and entertaining simultaneously. My favorite broadcast was when Adam did his ＃Bedtime show with his wife. They talk about “dating” and their two young sons run into the room and Adam shouts cheek at them because both him and his wife are nakey under the bed. I was in a fit of giggles. The sons were both laughing, and mortified. I am always thoroughly entertained and delighted by what happens next with adam’s family! Adam also coined the term the ＃PeriFamily thanks to his loyal followers. I ‘ve tried to make this happen in my office, but like ‘fetch’ it’s just not happening!\n** — [Abigail**](https:\/\/www.periscope.tv\/abigail_purcell)\n\n# “Sunset faroe islands” by [tsjohansen](https:\/\/www.periscope.tv\/tsjohansen)\n\nWe had just added the ability to see replays on the Map view, and I was searching around to find broadcasts in areas I wasn’t familiar with. I saw a blue dot between Iceland and Norway in the middle of the ocean and was intrigued. Broadcasts located in the middle of the ocean tend to yield surprises.\n\nWhile it was a short broadcast from a photographer (and his only one ever) showcasing the sunset he was seeing, I had never heard of these islands before, and when I saw their topography as he panned around, and the light from the sunset, I was immediately struck. “I must visit this place,” I told myself. Since then, I’ve been doing homework on the islands, and talked to friends who have visited them. One of Periscope’s great powers for me is the ability to discover places and cultures and customs I’m not familiar with, and can find new places I want to experience in person.\n** — [Bill**](https:\/\/www.periscope.tv\/couch)\n\n# “Secret Cove outside san francisco — come join our treasure hunt!🙏🙀👹” by Jenn[ifer Paden\n\nThese were broadcasted from my girlfriend’s account, while 4 of us were headed to Kirby Cove to camp for a night. It’s probably the most fun I ever had broadcasting, so it’s my favorite.\n** — [Thiago**](https:\/\/www.periscope.tv\/thiagorobert15)\n\n# “We are watching a Penguin Parade!” by [Monterey Bay Aquarium](https:\/\/www.periscope.tv\/MontereyAq)\n\nThis was just a scope of penguins walking around the aquarium — and it’s my favorite! As we watched the group waddle down the carpeted aquarium hallways, our penguin patron\/guide to the Monterey Bay Aquarium, Patrick, explained that the walk is an enrichment offered to the birds. The broadcast was as informative as it was adorable and if I could, I’d watch one a day.\n** —[ Kim**](https:\/\/www.periscope.tv\/kats)\n\n# “Leopard in a tree. ＃migration2015” by[ Garry Van Der Walt](https:\/\/www.periscope.tv\/@gerryvanderwalt)\n\nIt was amazing to be able to watch a live broadcast of a leopard relaxing on a tree branch in its natural habitat in Kenya. The broadcaster added a whole new layer of coolness and creativity to the broadcast by using binoculars to zoom in on the leopard and its meal.\n** — [Nader**](https:\/\/www.periscope.tv\/naderz)\n\n![](https:\/\/periscope.neocities.org\/blog\/assets\/1-5YFY03bVhJPbhxmEpFIPSw.jpeg)\n\n# “Can’t-miss ＃UberKITTENS Cam” by [Uber](https:\/\/www.periscope.tv\/uber)\n\nWhat’s not to love about a super cute kitten cam :) Uber occasionally runs a promotion where local animal shelters go around the city and let you hang out with kittens and puppies — and you can call them right from the app. Unfortunately there’s always such high demand that I’ve never been able to see the kittens myself, but Uber did the next best thing: they Periscoped it! They set up an area in their office at their headquarters where the kittens roamed around, and they Periscoped it all day. It was an adorable break to be able to check in the kittens throughout the day, and it brought a smile to my face.\n** — [Sara**](https:\/\/www.periscope.tv\/pandemona)\n\n[![Youtube](https:\/\/img.youtube.com\/vi\/6f02sUkJ7Z0\/hqdefault.jpg)](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=6f02sUkJ7Z0)\n\n# “Goldbirdman” by [Adam Goldberg](https:\/\/www.periscope.tv\/theadamgoldberg)\n\nThis broadcast really demonstrated how Periscope can create entirely new forms of performance entertainment for a live audience. In the broadcast, Adam Goldberg performs an improvised sketch in the style of the movie Birdman while walking around the streets of New York. He takes on the role of Birdman, while the person holding the phone (camera) acts as the sinister voice in the background that represent his darker thoughts. The audience is then able to watch as Adam walks around the city looking frazzled, confused, and speaking to himself, while the deep voice behind the camera yells at him at him in anger and brings him down. Also, while this is all happening, the people in the street around get more and more confused at the scene they are witnessing. It was a really amazing piece of art, and knowing that it was all happening live, with people around the world watching and commenting on the performance felt incredibly special, and really stuck with me as one of the best uses of Periscope.\n** — [Pablo**](https:\/\/www.periscope.tv\/pablo)\n\n![](https:\/\/periscope.neocities.org\/blog\/assets\/1-WDXyBBIUas2rb61HUGeWTg.jpeg)\n\n# “Old 97 little rock last night of tour” by [Ken Bethea](https:\/\/www.periscope.tv\/tornillo)\n\nI was surfing in Couch Mode on web (my favorite way to find interesting broadcasts) and suddenly saw the leader singer of the Old 97’s, one of my favorite bands. I immediately grabbed my phone, searched for the broadcast and starting commenting like a true fangirl.\n\nRhett Miller hasn’t broadcasted before, so I wasn’t expecting to see his face right there staring at me. When I entered the broadcast there were around 20 people, all huge fans of the Old 97’s. Ken Bethea (harpsichordist for the Old 97’s) gave us a tour of their bus, walked around and then took us to sound check. During sound check he asked the audience on Periscope what they should practice. I requested “Book of Poems” and seconds later, they were playing it. Sitting at my desk in San Francisco, I was able to attend a sound check for one of my favorite bands in Little Rock, Arkansas, request a song and be transported somewhere I would otherwise never have access to. Even after watching hundreds of broadcasts everyday, my mind was blown.\n** — [Lili**](https:\/\/www.periscope.tv\/lilisalzberg)\n\n# “Paris Live Place De La République ＃parisattacks ＃jesuisparis” by[ Die Welt](https:\/\/www.periscope.tv\/welt)\n\nThis broadcast captured the mood in Paris, the day after the attacks, with respect and empathy for the victims, mourners and city. The broadcast focused on those laying tributes at Place De La Republique. Speaking very few words, the broadcaster captured the somber tone, broadcasting for over an hour and 25 mins. It was both moving and extraordinary to be transported to that scene, live, and to be given an opportunity to grieve with Paris from across the Atlantic.\n** — [Nick**](https:\/\/www.periscope.tv\/nicksallon)\n\n# “It’s Strange — K.Flay” by [Justin Starry](https:\/\/www.periscope.tv\/starry)\n\nI recently moved across the country and before I left Boston my friend and I tried getting tickets to a show featuring an artist we had just discovered named K.Flay. Unfortunately the show had sold out and we missed the opportunity to see her. Fast forward a few months and I got tickets to see K.Flay and while at the show I Periscoped my favorite song. To my surprise, my friend in Boston tuned in almost immediately and we were able to share that moment that was otherwise impossible due to the sold out tickets a few months ago.\n** — [Justin**](https:\/\/www.periscope.tv\/starry)\n\n![](https:\/\/periscope.neocities.org\/blog\/assets\/1-yux-FYT9rVnK60gFsbBs2A.png)\n\n# **“**The Wilder Society Xmas Backyard Sessions” by [The Wilder Society](https:\/\/www.periscope.tv\/wilder_society)\n\nIt was a backyard christmas party in Santa Monica. There was a no-name band on the deck in front of a glowing christmas tree visible through the open sliding glass door. There was a guitar, banjo, and backing singer doing a loose arrangement of the First Noel. They all had good voices. They seemed to be the first in a long line-up that would follow. I liked the music but it was also just personal resonance and nostalgia. It reminded me of LA where I used to visit my wife before we got married. It reminded me of earlier times when I knew more musicians. They seemed like people I might like to know.\n\nBut really, I don't have one favorite broadcast. I've found that when I watch broadcasts indiscriminately during daylight hours, I come away having seen some cool stuff in aggregate. Once I saw a chubby 10-year-old in sweats asking for hearts to motivate him through his ridiculous martial arts exercise routine. Sweetest kid ever.\n** — [Mark**](https:\/\/www.periscope.tv\/marmars)\n\n# Unknown by [David Blaine](https:\/\/www.periscope.tv\/davidblaine)\n\nIn the early days, David did a couple of magic tricks and showed one of his friends that does live art. Both of these broadcasts were so rad to see because they were happening live. For the magic tricks, it was just like being right there with the other viewers. The things he does blows your mind and to see it live was even better.\n** — [Judette**](https:\/\/www.periscope.tv\/jtplatz)\n\n![](https:\/\/periscope.neocities.org\/blog\/assets\/1-Am0m0Aq6o8ri_7LF3UcrDg.png)\n\n# Everything by [Yellowstone National Park](https:\/\/www.periscope.tv\/yellowstonenps)\n\nI like yellowstone. I cannot go there myself so watching it is cool.\n** — [Jonathan**](https:\/\/www.periscope.tv\/jle)\n\n# “I’m a brain scientist, ask me anything” by [Ian McLaughlin](https:\/\/www.periscope.tv\/@_Anthropoid)\n\nI love Ian’s broadcasts because it gives viewers the opportunity to ask questions and interact with a neuroscience PhD candidate, someone whom I likely wouldn’t have met in real life and do it in a way which is much less tedious and more fun than having a text-only back and forth. There’s huge potential for subject matter experts from many fields to connect with viewers from around the world and learn something new from an experts in those fields. I especially like that Ian considers his regular Periscope sessions a way to improve his skills in communicating to a layperson about his passions as well as a way to stumble upon and think through subjects he may not have thought of himself.\n** — [Suyash**](https:\/\/www.periscope.tv\/suyash)\n\n![](https:\/\/periscope.neocities.org\/blog\/assets\/1-6BkJrNt-ZTcfkfWQYXQNHg.jpeg)\n\n# “Up close to Henry VIII’s flagship: Mary Rose. Recovered after 400 years on the seabed.” by [Dan Snow](https:\/\/www.periscope.tv\/thehistoryguy)\n\nOne of my favourite broadcasters is the historian Dan Snow. His depth of knowledge, great camera work and interaction with his audience has turned his tours of museums, castles and even the site of ancient Troy into fantastic experiences. One of the best was his tour of Henry VIII’s flagship the Mary Rose, buried in the Solent for over 400 years. He took advantage of special access to the ship, using a crane and a colleague broadcasting a second viewpoint to answer our questions and give us real insight into this famous ship and its history.\n** — [Geraint**](https:\/\/www.periscope.tv\/geraint)\n\n# “Grand Army Plaza in Brooklyn” by [NYC Parks](https:\/\/www.periscope.tv\/nycparks)\n\nI came across NYC parks on the featured users list. Although, I’ve never been to New York, I’ve always wanted to visit and finally have a trip planned for February. Of course, the internet is a great resource and I could easily research things to do. But it’s hard to find things that are really unique, historical and exclusive. That’s one of the reasons I followed NYC Parks. In this particular broadcast, a team of experts guides us (the viewers) through the arch at the park. The arch is closed to the public so it was really cool seeing something that I would be able to see, even when I visit New York. The views from the top of the arch were spectacular! There was the Manhattan skyline on one side and on the other side you could see the famous Brooklyn Library.\n** — Jag**\n\n![](https:\/\/periscope.neocities.org\/blog\/assets\/1-oEiP-caV0T-qi2wwJrX4mQ.png)\n\n# “Playing Guitar” by [Chris Hadfield](https:\/\/www.periscope.tv\/Cmdr_Hadfield)\n\nI had just gotten the Periscope beta and it was the first broadcast I ever joined, so I wasn’t really sure what to expect. I was walking off a ferry that had just docked in San Francisco, watching Commander Hadfield sitting in his home office, playing guitar and simply talking to the handful of us who were watching. I had planned on calling an Uber, but I became so caught up in this broadcast that, 20 minutes later, I realized I’d walked the whole way home while watching it. Someone asked him what his greatest fear while in space was. Another asked if he’d play us Space Oddity. He did, and it was fantastic. \n** — [Jonah**](https:\/\/www.periscope.tv\/jonah)\n\n# We can’t wait to see what 2016 brings!\n\n\n- - - -\nurl: https:\/\/medium.com\/periscope\/5-broadcasters-you-should-be-watching-this-week-74a7817d7e3b\ntitle: 5 Broadcasters You Should Be Watching This Week\nsubtitle: Welcome to our new monthly blog post, where we highlight five new broadcasters you should be watching on Periscope!\nslug: 5-broadcasters-you-should-be-watching-this-week\ndescription: \ntags: periscope,social-media,travel,animals,makeup\nauthor: Periscope\nusername: periscope\n- - - -\n\n# 5 Broadcasters You Should Be Watching This Week\n\nWelcome to our new monthly blog post, where we highlight five new broadcasters you should be watching on Periscope!\n\n**1.

Thank you for your global perspective, for your thoughtful feedback, and inspiring ideas. We’ve shipped three updates since our last blog post, and today we launched version 1.0.4 ([download here](https:\/\/itunes.apple.com\/app\/id972909677)). We’re excited to highlight some of the new features we’ve added:\n\n* **“I’m not a fan of my profile picture” **— Well, we think you look great, but by popular demand, we added an option to change your profile picture. A tap on your avatar in your Profile will prompt you to change your photo to one in your Camera Roll, or to take a new photo.\n\n* **“Can I sign up without a Twitter account?”** — Until now, you needed a Twitter account to signup. For existing Twitter users, we recommend signing up via Twitter (we’ll help suggest people to follow based on your Twitter social graph), but we’ve also added an option to signup using your phone number.\n\n![](https:\/\/periscope.neocities.org\/blog\/assets\/1-MndnrjC-sxEseVnAHcTZaw.png)\n\n![](https:\/\/periscope.neocities.org\/blog\/assets\/1-rHXb-LTgN8tzLBuA4VFyqw.png)\n\n* **“It’s hard to reply directly to people in chat” — **We made it easier to reply to somebody’s comment during a broadcast. Tap the comment, hit the reply button, and you’ll automatically be presented with a response including that person’s @handle. Replies that mention you will appear with an arrow.\n\n![](https:\/\/periscope.neocities.org\/blog\/assets\/1-hY4iOWnMPl4_wbYmvQU_2w.png)\n\n* **An update on blocking users** — When a broadcaster blocks a participant during their broadcast, a message is posted to the chatroom indicating that the block occurred. We think this adds an important layer of transparency and accountability to the comments in a broadcast.\n\nAs always, we’ve also made a number of performance improvements and squashed tons of bugs🐞. Thank you all for feedback and ideas. Please continue to share your suggestions to @periscopehelp on Twitter or email us at h[elp@periscope.tv.](mailto:help@periscope.tv)\n\nMuch Love,\nTeam Periscope\n\n![Team Periscope, accompanied by Chief Canine Officer Scotch](https:\/\/periscope.neocities.org\/blog\/assets\/1-Y8nVbm47c8TMStv4VTk2aA.jpeg)\n\n\n- - - -\nurl: https:\/\/medium.com\/periscope\/web-profiles-for-periscopers-cfb5d191da83\ntitle: Web Profiles for Periscopers\nsubtitle: Periscope web profiles are finally here!

See the world through someone else’s eyes — that’s been our mission since day one. Today, we’re bringing this vision directly into Twitter by making it possible to watch broadcasts without leaving the Twitter app.\n\nSince launch, there have been over 100 million broadcasts created on Periscope. Whenever a broadcast is shared on Twitter, you tap the link to open the Periscope app. Today, we’re replacing those links with the broadcast itself, autoplaying right within the Tweet. And when you tap the video, it goes full-screen and shows Periscope comments and hearts from other viewers. You don’t need the Periscope app or even a Periscope account.\n\nImagine scrolling through Twitter, reading about [Mitch Oates](https:\/\/www.periscope.tv\/mitchoates)’ underwater adventures. You suddenly find yourself peering through a hole in your timeline out into his world, via his live broadcast. This adds a whole new dimension to Twitter.\n\n> Periscope broadcasts now come alive within Twitter https:\/\/amp.twimg.com\/v\/4c29eb00-728b-488e-8e6d-9782e686d2db ...  \n> <p>&＃x200a;&mdash;&＃x200a;<a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/periscopeco\/status\/686880541224775681\">@periscopeco<\/a><\/p>  \n\nFor broadcasters, this means you can reach the massive Twitter audience. And for everyone on Twitter, there’s now a richer experience in your home timeline, search results, and on anyone’s profile who’s shared a Periscope.\n\nWe’re rolling out this feature on Twitter for iOS over the next few days. To everyone using Twitter for Android or on web: we haven’t forgotten about you! We plan to roll these features out on all platforms as soon as they’re ready.\n\nWith love,\nTeam Periscope and all our friends at Twitter\n\n\n- - - -\nurl: https:\/\/medium.com\/periscope\/periscope-on-android-is-live-94f1734b22a4\ntitle: Periscope on Android is LIVE\nsubtitle: Get Periscope on the Google Play Store\nslug: periscope-on-android-is-live\ndescription: \ntags: tech,social-media,periscope\nauthor: Periscope\nusername: periscope\n- - - -\n\n![](https:\/\/periscope.neocities.org\/blog\/assets\/1-l-wy83-E4hUJPDiSrE1-7A.jpeg)\n\n# Periscope on Android is LIVE\n\n[Get Periscope on the Google Play Store](https:\/\/play.google.com\/store\/apps\/details?id=tv.periscope.android)\n\nWhen we started Periscope, we wanted to build the closest thing to [teleportation](https:\/\/medium.com\/@periscope\/up-periscope-f0b0a4d2e486) — by providing users with the best way to start or watch a live video broadcast. As a small startup, our initial launch was limited to just iOS, but we’ve been working really hard to craft an experience that feels special on Android, yet still unmistakably Periscope. Today, we’re excited to announce the launch of [Periscope on Android](https:\/\/play.google.com\/store\/apps\/details?id=tv.periscope.android)!\n\n![](https:\/\/periscope.neocities.org\/blog\/assets\/1-QulginDTsPwctkU4RoTyZg.gif)\n\nAndroid owners using Version 4.4 (KitKat) and above can download Periscope from [Google Play](https:\/\/play.google.com\/store\/apps\/details?id=tv.periscope.android). Periscope on Android has all the same core features that Periscope users have come to love: start a public or private broadcast, choose to allow comments from just those you follow, and interact with a broadcaster by chatting or sending hearts. There are a few things that are unique to Android:\n\n* The application features a Material-inspired design that should feel familiar but modern to Android users\n\n* Android users have granular control over additional Push Notification settings, such as “First Time Broadcast notifications” (when somebody you follow on Twitter broadcasts on Periscope for the first time) and “Share notifications” (when somebody you follow on Periscope shares somebody else’s broadcast).\n\n* Periscope on Android offers you a “Resume notification” so you can keep watching where you left off in case your broadcast gets interrupted (by a phone call or message)\n\n![Periscope on Android makes it easy to resume where you left off.](https:\/\/periscope.neocities.org\/blog\/assets\/1-Yse1uMz0e4x_99AJWphEeA.png)\n\n* Replays are saved without requiring the broadcaster to upload a file. This should save broadcasters lots of time and preserve precious mobile data allowance!\n\nThis is just the beginning for Periscope on Android. We have many exciting features and improvements in the works, so please follow us at [@periscopeco](https:\/\/twitter.com\/periscopeco) to stay updated.\n\n*Love,\n[@pandemona](https:\/\/twitter.com\/pandemona), [@lientm](https:\/\/twitter.com\/lientm), [@jle](https:\/\/twitter.com\/jle), and the rest of the [@periscopeco](https:\/\/twitter.com\/periscopeco) team*\n\n[Get Periscope on the Google Play Store](https:\/\/play.google.com\/store\/apps\/details?id=tv.periscope.android)\n\n\n- - - -\nurl: https:\/\/medium.com\/periscope\/coming-soon-broadcast-search-drones-and-save-beyond-24-hours-9bfe397b593a\ntitle: Coming Soon: Broadcast Search, Drones and Save Beyond 24 Hours\nsubtitle: Dear Periscope Community,\n \nEveryday, our community creates amazing broadcasts — whether visiting a new place, performing a song, or…\nslug: coming-soon-broadcast-search-drones-and-save-beyond-24-hours\ndescription: \ntags: social-media,drones,internet\nauthor: Periscope\nusername: periscope\n- - - -\n\n![](https:\/\/periscope.neocities.org\/blog\/assets\/1-tWRrl7DGv0PJdhQ3bgu90w.jpeg)\n\n# Coming Soon: Broadcast Search, Drones and Save Beyond 24 Hours\n\nDear Periscope Community,\n \nEveryday, our community creates amazing broadcasts — whether visiting a new place, performing a song, or sparking a passionate discussion. In the coming weeks, we’re launching broadcast search and drone support to help people form communities around the topics they care about and broadcast from new perspectives. We also want to share a preview of our full beyond 24 hours approach that will be available in the coming weeks.\n\n# **Search for Broadcasts You’re Interested In**\n\n![](https:\/\/periscope.neocities.org\/blog\/assets\/1-yxQeHS7uVxfuPpG4k0_8Uw.png)\n\nIn the coming weeks, you’ll be able to search for broadcasts by title or topic. When you tap on the search button in the Global List, you’ll see a list of suggested topics to search for, including ＃Travel, ＃Music, ＃Food and more. To broadcast about a topic, simply tap the Broadcast button in the topic’s search results to add the relevant hashtag, or add the hashtag to your title directly.\n \nWe’re also testing two special topics that you can search for. In “First Scope,” you can welcome new broadcasters to our community. In “GoPros and Drones,” you can find broadcasts from GoPros and, for the first time, drones!\n\n# A New Perspective with Drones\n\nTo broadcast from a supported DJI drone, just connect your iPhone to your drone’s remote. We’ll automatically pull in your drone’s video feed and let you switch between it, your iPhone cameras and even your GoPro. During your broadcast, you can narrate from a bird’s eye view using your phone or even [Sketch](https:\/\/twitter.com\/periscopeco\/status\/725452090244521984) on the broadcast to highlight different sights:\n\n> Broadcast from a bird&#39;s eye view with drones!

Today, we want to give you a preview of the full solution that we’re launching in the next few weeks.\n\n![Follow Saki and her saved broadcasts around Japan](https:\/\/periscope.neocities.org\/blog\/assets\/1-AdkIjUkW0eadroRhJ0HmoA.png)\n\nOur goal is to give you full control of your broadcasts. Soon, your broadcasts will be automatically saved on Periscope and Twitter with comments and hearts. Should you change your mind, you can still delete your broadcasts at any time in the post-broadcast screen or in your profile. And, for those of you who still want your broadcasts to be removed after 24 hours, you can easily configure that in your account settings.\n \nWe hope these updates will make it easier for you to find broadcasts and communities that you care about.

We’ve collected some of the more notable clips below, from the night Sterling was killed through a live stream of his funeral last Friday.\n\nVisceral images are powerful; data and research appear to be lagging behind. Records of officer-involved shootings are collected haphazardly, with much of it provided voluntarily by local police departments, many of which do not participate. Even so, disturbing patterns are visible. One of the most prominent studies to date, an analysis by [**ProPublica](http:\/\/www.propublica.org\/article\/deadly-force-in-black-and-white) **of admittedly incomplete FBI records from 1980-2012, concluded black teens were 21 times as likely as white teens to be shot and killed by police between 2010–2012.\n\nSuch disparities may not be new, but they are newly visible due to cell phone cameras and social media. Will these prove powerful enough to provoke real inquiry, and change?\n\n> Protesters outside Triple S Food Mart in Baton Rouge, after alleged police shooting caught on video. @kelsthegreat_https:\/\/www.periscope.tv\/kelsthegreat_\/1YpKkpNQqOjGj ...  \n> <p>&＃x200a;&mdash;&＃x200a;<a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/periscopetv\/status\/750720436372119553\">@periscopetv<\/a><\/p>  \n\n> LIVE on ＃Periscope: Press conference: Mayor Holden &amp; BRPD Chief Dabadie give statement on officer involved shootinghttps:\/\/www.periscope.tv\/w\/akvTcTFKUkttWlpZb3B2alB8MXlvSk1MQWdEcFJHUeHoIrt_3yn-yL6tBVxIGVed1H-mvSiqaJIFJWDcpZA2 ...  \n> <p>&＃x200a;&mdash;&＃x200a;<a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/brpd\/status\/750723589788225536\">@brpd<\/a><\/p>  \n\n> LIVE on ＃Periscope: New York protests over last nights shootings in the US ＃BlackLivesMatter ＃PhilandoCastile ＃Alto...https:\/\/www.periscope.tv\/w\/ak16cTFXZ0VnYWJXQVlBS3Z8MVBsSlFqYVFlUWR4RTKURbMqIR30nolX6iKE2ofTQgllpoitLmLpFy_jw30O ...  \n> <p>&＃x200a;&mdash;&＃x200a;<a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/radiokermath\/status\/751177793694683138\">@radiokermath<\/a><\/p>  \n\n> LIVE on ＃Periscope: ＃blacklivesmatter protest Londonhttps:\/\/www.periscope.tv\/w\/ak6iTTFyYVFaRERkcm5Yanp8MURYR3ladm9udnlKTQdCT_DXJ_zIK4uLtPl9V5PgUxf1sGFbwQzNpxofGiSk ...  \n> <p>&＃x200a;&mdash;&＃x200a;<a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/osx_ail\/status\/751495460712550401\">@osx_ail<\/a><\/p>  \n\n> @deray is arrested at 4:45 for walking on the highway during a ＃BlackLivesMatter protest in Baton Rouge, LAhttps:\/\/www.periscope.tv\/w\/alBq0Dg2Mjg0MDV8MURYeHlaanZyV1ZLTfx3RD7nWL_3TQzX2qKrNjWkHAs03oQOWSpo4x-YI1Zk ...  \n> <p>&＃x200a;&mdash;&＃x200a;<a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/periscopetv\/status\/751986572891828224\">@periscopetv<\/a><\/p>  \n\n> LIVE on ＃Periscope: Saint Paul highway protesthttps:\/\/www.periscope.tv\/w\/alB0nzEyOTQ0NzgwfDFqTUpnbm1CZ1htR0wpnsmfrUIlPetoUP692ktbLPredFTYrXOAdl85D6Sldw== ...  \n> <p>&＃x200a;&mdash;&＃x200a;<a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/little_goon\/status\/751996163033853952\">@little_goon<\/a><\/p>  \n\n> LIVE on ＃Periscope: Alton Sterling Funeralhttps:\/\/www.periscope.tv\/w\/alemZDExMzkzfDFncXh2QmVXRXpreEK9Wm7Y2qmAroXln8BSVu_z-XGBfmAiBk4H6ywZ3EEIlg== ...  \n> <p>&＃x200a;&mdash;&＃x200a;<a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/fusion\/status\/753973749217505281\">@fusion<\/a><\/p>  \n\n\n- - - -\nurl: https:\/\/medium.com\/periscope\/lets-all-hang-out-irl-530d95a0b1e8\ntitle: Let’s All Hangout IRL!\nsubtitle: Some of our favorite moments since launching Periscope have been meeting our community in person.

Whether you are interested in planning an event or simply attending one, we want to help make these experiences more fun and accessible for everyone in the community. We are excited to start supporting these in a meaningful way, and hope the following tips, tricks and FAQs will inspire you\n \n If you are planning a meetup:\n\n* Keep meetups simple, and make sure they are as open as possible. One of the best things about the Periscope community is that anyone can be a part of it. Meetups should be the same.\n\n* Pick a unique hashtag for the event — it will help you promote and connect with others, make your broadcasts more discoverable and encourage people from all over the world to join via Periscope.\n\n* Plan meetups around a topic or location. Want to get all the ＃PottersofPeriscope together? Or just want to meet everyone else in Paris that loves Periscope?

We use live video as a medium because when you watch events unfold live, it’s a more authentic experience. In our living rooms today, broadcast television is the closest thing we have to this. However, as live television becomes more and more produced, it can also become less genuine. This is what excites us about bringing Periscope to the Apple TV — the notion that you, your friends and family, can share what’s happening in the world *right now*, together.\n\n![](https:\/\/periscope.neocities.org\/blog\/assets\/1-rb3IBYDMD9HYpKwF6RkeHA.gif)\n\nPeriscope on your TV lets you instantly experience live broadcasts. Open the app, and you’ll see a collection of live broadcasts from around the world (no account signup needed). You can send hearts to the broadcaster and read comments from other people watching with you. At any time, you can skip to the next broadcast, hide or show comments and hearts, and return to the main menu for an entirely fresh collection of places to go. If a broadcast ends, Periscope will automatically take you to the next destination.\n\nSo what’s next for this project? We see tons of possibilities and are really looking forward to hearing about how people use this first iteration. Giving everyone a way to access and share their personal feeds really excites us, as does the prospect of creating new ways to interact with the broadcaster. And of course, we’re always working to bring new types of content and new forms of discovery to the platform.\n\n__vimeo__:\n[![vimeo](http:\/\/i.vimeocdn.com\/video\/541817585_1280.jpg)](https:\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/144068600)\n\nA perk of working at Periscope is that you see *a lot* of broadcasts. Each day is its own miniature exploration in human anthropology. What makes it great is that we experience it together; it spurs constant discussion, just as we hope it will for you. We’re so excited for you to try what we’ve built — we’ve only begun to scratch the surface. Enjoy, and happy scoping!\n\n\n- - - -\nurl: https:\/\/medium.com\/@AskAshleyK\/so-awesome-989620c4898b\ntitle: So awesome!\nsubtitle: \nslug: so-awesome\ndescription: \ntags: live-streaming,social-media,strategic-thinking,social-media-marketing,hustle\nauthor: Ashley K\nusername: AskAshleyK\n- - - -\n\nSo awesome!

It still amazes us that so many kind, smart and generous people agreed to take this journey. The recent executive order to halt immigration from seven countries in the Middle East and Africa has forced us to consider a disturbing alternate reality in which the Periscope team is irreparably changed.\n\nPeriscope is built, maintained, and operated by people from many faiths and countries. **Without immigrants and refugees, Periscope would not exist. **For this reason, we are updating the Periscope loading screen to make a simple true statement: “Proudly made in America by immigrants.”\n\nWe feel this is an important statement to make about who we are and the real impact of these policies. We also fundamentally believe in maintaining an impartial product that gives a voice to every person in our community. Periscope has been and will always be a safe environment for people of any political and religious viewpoint. Now more than ever, Periscope is a critical tool for unfiltered, global dialogue.\n \nMuch love,\nJoe, Kayvon & the Periscope Team\n\n![](https:\/\/periscope.neocities.org\/blog\/assets\/1-02_CWszCtxfH44vs6-3niQ.png)\n\n\n- - - -\nurl: https:\/\/medium.com\/periscope\/golive-gopro-50b050f5ce85\ntitle: GoLIVE, GoPro\nsubtitle: We’ve seen people put their phones in some precarious situations — they’ve been taped to drones, tied to balloons and submerged underwater…\nslug: golive-gopro\ndescription: \ntags: social-media,adventure,photography\nauthor: Periscope\nusername: periscope\n- - - -\n\n![](https:\/\/periscope.neocities.org\/blog\/assets\/1--WW4YIVStiT62TW9w-Enbw.png)\n\n# GoLIVE, GoPro\n\n> @zbigy makes it look so easy ＃GoLIVE ＃GoPro https:\/\/amp.twimg.com\/v\/91d961be-4e34-46ab-ba6d-98c80ff04b0a ...  \n> <p>&＃x200a;&mdash;&＃x200a;<a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/periscopeco\/status\/692147745235214336\">@periscopeco<\/a><\/p>  \n\nWe’ve seen people put their phones in some precarious situations — they’ve been taped to drones, tied to balloons and submerged underwater. Creativity always finds a way, but we wanted to [make it a little bit easier](http:\/\/GoPro.com\/news). Today, you can broadcast from your GoPro HERO 4 directly to Periscope for iPhone. Keep that phone safely tucked away.\n\n[Here’s how it works](https:\/\/help.periscope.tv\/customer\/portal\/articles\/2287095):\n\n1. Connect to your GoPro’s WiFi, making sure it’s on video mode.\n\n1. Open Periscope on your iPhone & tap the broadcast button.\n\n1. The GoPro button will automatically be highlighted — so give your broadcast a title and go live.\n\n![](https:\/\/periscope.neocities.org\/blog\/assets\/1-CAdUygJbz_z19m1Nvqanog.png)\n\nOnce you’re live, you can double tap to switch between your GoPro and iPhone cameras. There’s also a new button that locks your phone screen, so nothing is accidentally pressed while it’s safely in your pocket.\n\n> “GoPro enables people to capture and share their experiences in the most immersive way possible, and the integration with Periscope provides GoPro users with a great, real-time platform to share their content.” — Tony Bates, President of GoPro  \n\nWe see so many awesome broadcasts every day — broadcasts of things we could never have imagined, things that truly blow us away. The creativity, passion and drive of our community is incredible. We’re expecting big things with this one.\n\nMuch love,\nTeam Periscope\n\n\n- - - -\nurl: https:\/\/medium.com\/periscope\/introducing-landscape-4eb42d903ed7\ntitle: Introducing Landscape\nsubtitle: You asked, we delivered!

In the latest version of iOS and Android, Periscopers can now hold their phones either in portrait or landscape. Here’s how it works: Viewers can continue holding their device in portrait, or match the broadcaster’s orientation to maintain full screen video. Either way, you’ll never need to tilt your head to watch sideways video.\n\n![](.\/assets\/0*M0Ton8i8SAGm42bk.gif)\n\nWhen we first launched Periscope, we only supported portrait broadcasting. As much as we’re fans of portrait video, we know that there are times where the scene you’re trying to capture is best expressed in landscape. We know the community has been craving this feature — we wanted to be thoughtful about our approach to ensure a seamless experience across all of our platforms (iOS, Android and Web).\n\n![](.\/assets\/0*ULFwGVBS9v0sMc0T.png)\n\nHere are some other new features we think you’ll love:\n\n![](.\/assets\/0*FjJRT34TwvaLVDRu.png)\n\n**Share Context: **When someone you follow shares a broadcast, it appears in your home feed. In this update, we’ve added an indicator beneath the broadcast title explaining who shared it with you. No more wondering why a broadcast showed up in your feed!\n\n**Accessibility: **We’ve heard from a lot of people that Periscope needs to be more accessible for visually impaired Periscopers. In this version we’ve made large steps towards improving support for iOS accessibility features. We’ll continue to invest in this over time!\n\n![](https:\/\/periscope.neocities.org\/blog\/assets\/1-givDAgY9sZ1laVlaMVIeIw.png)\n\n**Mutual Follow***: *This update makes private broadcasting much easier on Android. When you start a private broadcast, you can choose from a list of mutual followers (people you follow, who also follow you). We think this list is a more natural selection of people who you are likely to broadcast to. We’ve also added an option to quickly select *all *of your mutual follows. See something you want to share with your friends, but not the whole world? Check. This same behavior is coming soon to iOS, so hang tight!\n\nWe hope you enjoy the new features! Let us know what you think. And thank you to the entire Periscope community for bringing the world to all of us, every day.\n\nGet the updates for [iOS](https:\/\/itunes.apple.com\/us\/app\/periscope\/id972909677?mt=8) and [Android](https:\/\/play.google.com\/store\/apps\/details?id=tv.periscope.android).\n\n\n- - - -\nurl: https:\/\/medium.com\/periscope\/medium-com-periscope-tweet-embeds-replay-highlights-live-autoplay-c01629ee8910\ntitle: Introducing Replay Highlights, Periscope Tweet Embeds and Live Autoplay\nsubtitle: Dear Periscope Community,\n \nThere are hundreds of millions of live and replay broadcasts on Periscope, and more get added everyday.

We’re introducing three new features today to make it easier for you to discover and watch the broadcasts that you’re interested in.\n\n### Watch Replay Highlights\n\n![Periscope Replay Highlights](https:\/\/periscope.neocities.org\/blog\/assets\/1-WHHLWbKuG4QeJqART6L4Aw.gif)\n\nWith so much to watch, we want to make it easier for you to find the best moments on Periscope. We’re introducing a new feature called Highlights, which automatically generates a short trailer for every Periscope broadcast. You can watch highlights of your home feed to catch up on broadcasts you missed from the last day, highlights of somebody’s profile to get a flavor for their previous broadcasts, or highlights of any search result (like ＃NoBillNoBreak or “pottery”) to get a convenient overview of any topic.\n\nWe look at a variety of signals to determine what parts of a replay should be included in a highlight and will continue to improve these signals over time. We hope that highlights make watching multiple replays an easy, engaging and seamless experience.\n\n### **Play Periscope Broadcasts in Embedded Tweets**\n\nExciting moments unfold live on Periscope and Twitter — from breaking news like [#NoBillNoBreak](https:\/\/twitter.com\/ScottPetersSD\/status\/745693620892766208?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) and [recent protests](https:\/\/www.rt.com\/news\/352494-gay-pride-rally-jerusalem\/) to sports events like [Wimbledon](https:\/\/twitter.com\/Wimbledon\/status\/752460713348694016) and the [MLB All-star Game](https:\/\/twitter.com\/MLB\/status\/752977528931823616).

On July 22, a fast-moving blaze exploded out of its steep gullies and nearby Placerita Canyon, threatening thousands of homes in the city of Santa Clarita to the west. Dryness, high winds and proximity to densely populated cities quickly made the Sand Fire one the most dangerous wild fires in California this year.\n\nFirefighters continued to make progress against the fire Thursday, with [InciWeb](http:\/\/inciweb.nwcg.gov\/incident\/4878\/) reporting it about 65 percent contained. So far, it has consumed more than 38,000 acres, or about 60 square miles. At least one death has been reported, and 18 structures and buildings have been destroyed. The cause is not yet known.\n\nPeriscopers @MarkHawk, @ReeseLives, @knxedmertz and @western_oracle captured these indelible images of the Sand Fire as it progressed over the past week.\n\n> LIVE on ＃Periscope: Canyon Country ＃SandFire After Evachttps:\/\/www.periscope.tv\/w\/amgXdzMzMDIxNjh8MVlxeG93VlhNT0V4dhOWOPhFvLJML8Rjsguvj835I44R0_4RGq8GRNMjBCyY ...  \n> <p>&＃x200a;&mdash;&＃x200a;<a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/markhawk\/status\/758493209790001152\">@markhawk<\/a><\/p>  \n\n> LIVE on ＃Periscope: 7\/26 ＃SandFire update.

As we navigate the limitless world of broadcasts, we are constantly in search of interesting and thought-provoking broadcasts to share with all of you. Today, these community curators bring some of the most compelling and diverse broadcasts to our attention. To give these curators a more pronounced voice, we are launching our subreddit [\/r\/periscopes](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/periscopes\/) (with an “s”).\n\n>> We hope that our subreddit will provide another avenue for us to connect with the broader Periscope community and facilitate a dialogue around the most exciting and compelling broadcasts.\n\nReddit is a creative and collaborative community, and with your help, we hope to discover more broadcasts to highlight on a regular basis. Together, we will also find new broadcasters — people who are using the platform in innovative ways and pushing the boundaries of Periscope.\n\nWe are often asked what we consider worthwhile enough to surface to our global community. Here are a few factors we believe make for compelling broadcasts:\n\n* **Creativity:** Broadcasts should feel original, expressive and inspire others to experiment.\n\n* **Interactivity: **The most interesting broadcasters interact directly with their audience.\n\n* **Relevance:** Periscope broadcasts often address timely subject matter, such as breaking news, specific themes or remarkable events.\n\n* **Unique Perspective: **The broadcast should ideally provide a unique view on the world.\n\n* **Interesting Content: **We love broadcasts that make you want to see more or show you something new.\n\nWith these attributes in mind, we encourage you to share any interesting broadcasts you come across with the community on \/r\/periscopes with a brief explanation as to why you were intrigued by it. To foster effective, dynamic discussion on this forum, we would also love to hear your perspective on what other people post through comments and votes. Please review our subreddit rules below, and we can’t wait to discover amazing broadcasts together!\n\n### **Do**\n\n1. Every submission must be a direct link to a Periscope broadcast that you think is either **feature-worthy** (in app, on Twitter, or in blog posts) or **interesting (**but maybe not perfect).\n\n1. With your submission, write why you love it or what makes it special.\n\n1. Upvote broadcasts when someone has submitted something you love.\n\n1. Keep comments on topic.\n\n1. Have fun and respect every individual’s unique taste (every voice is important!)\n\n### Don’t\n\n1. Submit your own broadcasts.\n\n1. Submit a broadcast someone else has already submitted.\n\nMuch Love,\nTeam Periscope\n\n\n\n","views":68,"updated":"2022-06-23T20:23:36Z","tags":["livestream","SwanLake","UberKITTENS","PottersofPeriscope","SandFire","MusicBeyondBorders","Vegan","PeriFamily","Dnipropetrovsk","travel","SantaClarita","breaking","Cockta","GoLIVE","inspire","Paraguay","TheNewsmakers","Cookalong","beach","Halloween","migration2015","Istanbul","RG15","Netherlands","BiroMakesABeat","save","Gazi","Periscope","NASCAR","DutchElection","PhilandoCastile","periscope","jesuisparis","ScopeDay","saltycures","halloween","Food","Alto","blacklivesmatter","GoPro","womencrossdmz2015","PlaceritaCanyon","golive","hawaii","negroniweek","NationalKindnessDay","ValleyFire","fire","DaytonaDay","Kiev","northshore","Travel","Music","BlackLivesMatter","Mojo","cookalong","YearTwo","Bedtime","parisattacks","NoBillNoBreak","glastonbury"],"type":null,"title":"Periscope

Command Formatting with ksc](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/H5hUOetX.png)\n\n<!--more-->\n\nDuring the course of [my iPhone Keyboarding project](https:\/\/uikeycommand.com), I managed to discover \"a command line tool to document and describe keyboard shortcuts in a standardized and properly formatted way\" called [ksc](https:\/\/github.com\/kotfu\/ksc). It's a Python utility that translates natural-language-formatted keyboard commands \"command control q\" into symbolized and standardized form: `⌃+⌘+Q`. Though it's not of particular use to me at this point, with my now well-established [Text Replacements](https:\/\/bilge.world\/text-replacement) and [TextExpander Snippets](https:\/\/app.textexpander.com\/public\/14093096578d4f40eeea15649f5cefbb), I realized - being a Python thing - that ksc might work with the iOS\/iPadOS shell emulator, [a-Shell](https:\/\/apps.apple.com\/us\/app\/a-shell\/id1473805438), and therefore, that a Siri Shortcut for converting plain language input to formatted key commands might be a cinch, and it was!\n\n![pip install ksc](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/OrSPAgJa.png)\n\n## Requirements\n\n1. [a-Shell for iOS\/iPadOS](https:\/\/apps.apple.com\/us\/app\/a-shell\/id1473805438) (Free)\n2. [Actions for iOS\/iPadOS](https:\/\/apps.apple.com\/us\/app\/a-shell\/id1473805438) (Also free)\n3. [ksc](https:\/\/github.com\/kotfu\/ksc) installed in a-Shell (Which should be as easy as `pip install ksc`)\n\nUsing an [Ask For Input](https:\/\/www.matthewcassinelli.com\/actions\/ask-for-input\/) action, my shortcut will prompt you to enter a natural language keyboard command. For the fullest explanation of supported inputs, see [ksc's documentation](https:\/\/github.com\/kotfu\/ksc\/blob\/main\/README.md). Your inputted command will be \"transformed\" via Actions' action into \"dash-case\" and placed within a command in the following format:\n\n```\nksc -ms -p command(Pre-Transformation Text) > Transformed Text.txt\n```\n\nBy default, the arguments `-ms` and `-p` are included, but these are entirely optional. From said docs:\n\n> There are several command line options to modify the output. The `-ms` or\n> `--modifier-symbols` options output the modifers as unicode symbols:\n> \n>     $ ksc -ms shift command u\n>     ⇧⌘U\n> \n> Apple says you should include a plus sign between symbols, but I think that it looks\n> ugly, so that's not the default. If you want it, add the `-p` or `--plus-sign` when\n> using `-ms`:\n> \n>     $ ksc -ms -p shift command u\n>     ⇧+⌘+U\n\nCreating a text file for each command within a-Shell may not be Best Practices, per se, but it's the simplest method I've found of reliably retrieving text back from the app within Siri Shortcuts. That said, the above command creates a text file containing the formatted output. A `Get File` a-Shell action paired with a [Get Text From Input](https:\/\/www.matthewcassinelli.com\/actions\/get-text-from-input\/) native action then retrieves the file contents, which is first cleaned up via another Actions action (trimming leading and trailing whitespace) before being copied to the system clipboard.\n\n[**Download my Key Command Formatting shortcut on RoutineHub**](https:\/\/routinehub.co\/shortcut\/12442).\n\n<!--comment-->\n\n#software #automation","views":1522,"updated":"2022-07-02T06:35:36Z","tags":["software","automation"],"type":null,"title":"Quick Key Command Formatting with ksc and Siri Shortcuts","slug":"ksc-shortcut","appearance":"norm","language":"en","rtl":false,"created":"2022-07-02T06:33:12Z","images":["https:\/\/i.snap.as\/H5hUOetX.png","https:\/\/i.snap.as\/OrSPAgJa.png"],"collection":{"public":false,"alias":"bilge","total_posts":0,"title":"The Psalms","verification_link":"","description":"A <a href=\"https:\/\/davidblue.wtf\/db.vcf\">narcoleptic yokel<\/a> on software and culture.","style_sheet":"","views":177027,"monetization_pointer":""},"paid":false},{"id":"vmpt3hswd2hv6scn","body":"![Whyp Banner](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/jHawyy3c.png)\n\nThe digitization of music distribution has become one of the most important stories of our age. If you know me, you know it’s one I am particularly invested in and effected by. A huge fraction of the most important people in my life are electronic musicians who’s lives are inevitably, interminably, and desperately effected by the music industry’s continued osmosis with “Big Tech” in ways that are unacceptably undercovered in popular media. As a result, the digital giants’ power over the fundamental existence of these artists - who are more essential to our cultural health than I have been able to articulate - remains dangerously consequential to a degree  unseen, trivialized, or both by the tech bro gods holding the strings, regardless of their intent. This story is difficult to write about in an engaging way because of how innocuous-seeming and nuanced its crucial bullet points can seem, like - for instance - a relatively little-known audio streaming utility [deciding with no small amount of reluctance](https:\/\/clypblog.tumblr.com\/post\/636222649313394688\/major-changes-coming-to-clyp) to eliminate its free account tier.\n\nhttps:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/UlYSvbv\n\nI have a list somewhere from my *Extratone* days of online services and projects I felt I had long taken for granted. Number one - as old readers [know all too well](https:\/\/bilge.world\/bandcamp-streaming-music) - is Bandcamp. Number two is [Clyp](https:\/\/clyp.it\/) - what *TechCrunch* described as “An Imgur For Sound” in the [single tech media story](https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2015\/02\/06\/clyp-wants-to-be-an-imgur-for-sound\/), ever, to mention it. Back in November, I received the first email from Clyp since verifying my account signup in Fall 2016: an official announcement - which has only 5 whole notes [on their official Tumblr blog](https:\/\/clypblog.tumblr.com\/post\/636222649313394688\/major-changes-coming-to-clyp) - explaining that free uploads were dying on December 5th of this year.\n\n> Turns out hosting millions of audio files is pretty expensive. So we ended up adding premium features like lossless WAV streaming, custom playback widgets, unlimited uploads, and much more. While this helped some, it wasn’t quite enough… This was a very tough decision, but we realized it is absolutely necessary for the long-term survival of Clyp.  \n\nLet me be clear: I didn’t set out to write this to punish or even criticize Clyp for this decision. I suspect their relatively nonchalant language about the situation doesn’t reflect the whole emotional reality of their predicament. I can’t even imagine the financial implications of maintaining a streaming service as a very small company, though - quite topically, at the moment - [something like 30+](https:\/\/web-strategist.com\/blog\/2021\/01\/30\/the-future-of-social-audio-startups-roadmap-business-models-and-a-forecast\/) small team-sourced “social audio” projects have formed [a sort of frenzy](https:\/\/www.theinformation.com\/articles\/clubhouse-and-the-future-of-cult-driven-social-platforms?utm_source=ti_app) surrounding the Clubhouse thing which has continued to occupy much of both [tech](http:\/\/stratechery.com\/2021\/clubhouses-inevitability\/) and [meta](https:\/\/www.niemanlab.org\/2021\/02\/buzzy-social-audio-apps-like-clubhouse-tap-into-the-age-old-appeal-of-the-human-voice\/) media’s attention through the Winter. We are fucking pigging out on bandwidth right now (lmao, 5G,) as we simultaneously only just begin to consider [the greater consequences of our gluttony](https:\/\/www.newyorker.com\/culture\/cultural-comment\/the-hidden-costs-of-streaming-music).\n\nThese stories are not my burden, but celebrating the little, unmentioned tools made of love by one and two-human teams and endlessly made obscure by the business-obsessed nature of the tech publications who once claimed to hunger for capital-i Innovation is basically my life purpose, right now. It is tempting to spend time mourning all the wonderful shit I’ve seen shared (and shared, myself) with Clyp, but that story is for another time. (I would [very much like to hear](https:\/\/twitter.com\/NeoYokel\/status\/1367583167473983493) any thoughts you’d like to share about this. Don’t hesitate to [get in touch](mailto:davidblue@extratone.com).) I won’t speculate on their future, right now, but well… Good luck, boys.\n\nhttps:\/\/twitter.com\/NeoYokel\/status\/1367583167473983493\n\n## Over It\n\nIn case you're new to the story and wondering why one wouldn't just go to Bandcamp or Soundcloud to host an audio file in a shareable way, let's differentiate between *sharing audio* and *music distribution*. If you're not lucky enough to have any electronic music-producing friends, let me do my best to construct an image for you: its 2 in the morning and you've been fiddling with the same track in your Digital Audio Workstation since before lunchtime, but it's just *not right* - or at least, you're pretty sure something's off, but you're also growing keenly aware of the fact that your ear is beyond absolutely fucked from listening to the same set of sounds over and over again for 14 hours and you simply cannot proceed in the production process of this particular file without a break - a deep palette cleanse, and some sleep. *However*, you've also been excited about finally being able to show some friends this combination of noises you've manifested somewhat unintentionally and kept telling them all evening that you were almost finished until they gave up and went to bed. You've resolved, though, that *something* from you *will* be waiting in the group DM for them to wake up to.\n\nhttps:\/\/twitter.com\/girlmeat5557\/status\/1368134014893166594","views":71,"updated":"2022-07-02T14:14:01Z","tags":[],"type":null,"title":"Losing Clyp, Gaining

another few weeks.​\n\nSomehow, I managed to find myself in possession of two Very Large image files: the(?) new dark\/light wallpaper pair coming in macOS Ventura. (Here they are in full, [**light**](https:\/\/davidblue.wtf\/ventura\/venturalight.jpg) and [**dark**](https:\/\/davidblue.wtf\/ventura\/venturadark.jpg), so we've got that out of the way.) I don't actually remember where they came from, so I hope that doesn't matter much to you. (Maybe don't contact me if it actually does lol.)\n\nAnyhow, I've actually had them for quite a while, but I've been meaning to do what I'm trying to tell you about for far, *far* longer. Basically, files (like images) can be stored within single Siri Shortcuts entirely in plaintext form thanks to the magic of [base64](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Base64) and the now quite familiar [Base64 Encode](https:\/\/matthewcassinelli.com\/actions\/base64-encode\/) action. I've been meaning to \"\"\"\"ǝ ƃ ɐ ɹ ǝ ʌ ǝ l\"\"\"\" this capability to simplify my own, sick, superficial, yet craven need to cycle through inordinately huge image files as my desktop backgrounds\/*wallpaper* for literally years, now, but I finally just fucking did it, all for you.\n\n[**VenturaLight**](https:\/\/www.icloud.com\/shortcuts\/f4e3460dfd684bf2a70bf4a55717d389)\n\n[**VenturaDark**](https:\/\/www.icloud.com\/shortcuts\/e28e2c01892b4fbdafb3a967061924d1)\n\nThey're very simple (3 whole actions!) but **please keep in mind that they are also gargantuan**. Since I'm super smart in a way I definitely love very much, I happen to know that *all* of one's Siri Shortcuts are actually stored in a single sqlite file that is constantly being prodded every which way by iCloud Drive's mania... Keeping these around is not going to help. \n\n![VenturaLight Shortcut](https:\/\/user-images.githubusercontent.com\/43663476\/180654883-bb3be598-77c4-4301-935f-be80f1998906.png)","views":68,"updated":"2022-07-24T16:13:31Z","tags":[],"type":null,"title":"","slug":"macos-ventura-wallpaper-shortcuts","appearance":"norm","language":"","rtl":false,"created":"2022-07-24T16:13:32Z","images":["https:\/\/user-images.githubusercontent.com\/43663476\/180654883-bb3be598-77c4-4301-935f-be80f1998906.png","https:\/\/user-images.githubusercontent.com\/43663476\/180654886-9a45f65f-1622-4d2b-86e7-480e2b95cd89.png","https:\/\/davidblue.wtf\/ventura\/venturalight.jpg","https:\/\/davidblue.wtf\/ventura\/venturadark.jpg"],"paid":false},{"id":"hoiqe1qd9kvnmsv0","body":"Updated `07242022-081735`\n\n- [**GitHub Issue**](https:\/\/github.com\/extratone\/bilge\/issues\/349)\n- [Siri Shortcuts and the DJ Screw Discography](drafts:\/\/open?uuid=610294A9-B6B2-4A07-9670-2B1D6F56AC7C)\n- [Notes-Siri Shortcuts and the DJ Screw Discography](drafts:\/\/open?uuid=5F877C6E-5B05-4FB6-AC15-C8A79C022DB1)\n- [WTF](https:\/\/davidblue.wtf\/drafts\/5F877C6E-5B05-4FB6-AC15-C8A79C022DB1.html)\n- [Things](things:\/\/\/show?id=Q315nh3B9rnBy6iXsNcJvT)\n\n---\n\n- [Download Random Screw Tape Shortcut](drafts:\/\/open?uuid=DC1EB754-6A2D-44FD-A0D5-0B12200E9093)\n- [DJ Screw Discography Shortcut](drafts:\/\/open?uuid=B2E41B55-07F5-4483-A1C0-C692EB0AA7F4)\n- [Video Demo](https:\/\/youtu.be\/9v_oc7GmvvM)\n\n<iframe width=\"auto\" height=\"auto\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/9v_oc7GmvvM?controls=0\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer;

All of it, accessible in multiple file formats, embeddable, superbly shareable!

The first is perhaps the most delightful - if all goes well, running it right out of the box should result in a random tape from the library downloaded in a folder of your specification (at install,) as well *actual playback*, in correct order, within the shortcut, itself.\n\nhttps:\/\/youtu.be\/9v_oc7GmvvM\n\nThis is magic, yes, but the second is *true power*. After picking folders at installation for 1) downloaded archive.org-sourced .zip files to live in temporarily before they are extracted and deleted and 2) your complete, correctly metatagged DJ Screw Tape library could - in theory, anyway - magically appear in a single, undoubtedly several hours-long run. I have yet to actually test the full bit myself, technically, but I can advise you to set Auto-Lock (`Settings ⇨ Display & Brightness ⇨ Auto-Lock`) to `Never`, make sure you leave the Shortcut open within the Shortcuts App, itself, and give it a shot, if possible.\n\n<!--comment-->\n\n#software #automation #music\n\n[1] I attempted to find this torrent for the sake of this post and well...

This summer has abruptly brought some life happens which will inevitably contribute further changes to a degree that warrants a very bloggy sort of Update Post.\n\nMost importantly, perhaps, is that I've found myself with a real, tangible, full-time Big Boy job as a nighttime custodian of *my actual elementary school*. Though I suppose it's never been revealed before, here, I actually love cleaning and love this school, particularly, so I'm more excited than I've ever been for any sort of documentable employment, but this means I will imminently be transitioning from a lifestyle with virtually zero time-bound obligations to working 3-11:15PM, Monday through Friday. Undoubtedly, this will have a profound effect on my [recently-announced](https:\/\/twitter.com\/NeoYokel\/status\/1542999255497023489) [consultancy business](https:\/\/davidblue.wtf\/services), but I'll be making an effort to formally update the adjacent Fantastical Openings links with revised availability.\n\n![iPad Media Center](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/Kxyy5PxB.jpeg)\n\nAdjacent to this news are the experiences I've had in the past few weeks helping a friend ready her third-grade, public school classroom, which have been particularly enlightening with regard to the extent that iPads have been integrated into the education of young children in this country. Some highlights from this discovery (in this particular, Title I Midwestern elementary school):\n\n- Every child will receive a 5th-generation, WiFi-only iPad ([iPad6,11](https:\/\/everymac.com\/systems\/apple\/ipad\/specs\/apple-ipad-9-7-inch-early-2017-wi-fi-only-specs.html)) which they will be able to take home over the course of the school year.\n- The district paid $299 per unit for said iPads, a mere $30 off their full retail price for the rest of us, $329.\n- The random device I picked up from the pile shown in the images embedded above had not been updated beyond iPadOS 15 (since March of this year.)\n- Responsibility for the maintenance, setup, and deployment of said iPads rests entirely on a single individual, who is also responsible for the \"media center\" (what many of us know as the *Library*.)\n- Responsibility for ongoing hardware considerations (charging and storage) is left entirely to individual teachers.\n- Net contributions from Apple, Inc. to this new aspect of childhood education reside some six or seven figures *in the negative*. \n\nIn the two weeks preceding our district's start date, I had the painful opportunity to tour some of my friend's colleagues' storage solutions for their student iPads. The image below is the one I chose to append to my appeal to the *MacStories* Discord, attempting to *leverage* workspace-obsessed yuppies' knowledge for the benefit of public education.\n\n![Sad iPad Rack](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/1o0iA322.png)\n\nThere were a few helpful replies, which made it clear that organizations with actual budgets for device storage have gravitated toward rolling carts.\n\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">I&#39;ve been made intimately aware just how integral YouTube has become in public education, these past few weeks. believe it or not, there is not a program - to the educators I&#39;ve spoken to&#39;s knowledge, anyway - that removes advertising from YouTube playback in this case.<\/p>&mdash; ⓓⓐⓥⓘⓓ ⓑⓛⓤⓔ (@NeoYokel) <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/NeoYokel\/status\/1565127670345744388?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">September 1, 2022<\/a><\/blockquote> <script async src=\"https:\/\/platform.twitter.com\/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"><\/script>\n\n## Going Forward\n\nThe time I haven't spent in this medium has been redirected toward a few key sources.

While I still find it [janky as hell](https:\/\/youtu.be\/Q8vkBuYJOz8) and deeply untrustworthy - among far too many other woes - I must admit that the bulk of shear hype surrounding its existence has indeed resulted in enough developer attention to achieve some technically interesting capabilities. Naturally, most of these feel absurdly redundant in context and *all* rely on age-old dependencies, but... well, today I uploaded the text of my almost five-year-old Microsoft Surface Laptop 2 Review to [its own dedicated Archive.org page](https:\/\/archive.org\/details\/microsoft-surface-laptop-2) in *thirteen* different formats rendered using Obsidian's (desktop-only) [Pandoc integration](https:\/\/obsidian.md\/plugins?id=obsidian-pandoc)!\n\nI lambaste with the sincere intent, at least, of being genuinely constructive, and I began upon this post hoping to do so *and* finally get around to highlighting one of Drafts' most essential (and taken for granted, I suspect) powers in its entirely cross-platform, system-level integration with Mail on Apple Platforms.\n\nOne of Drafts' most immediately apparent advantages as a *native* iOS\/iPadOS\/macOS application is readily found in [its integration with Mail](https:\/\/docs.getdrafts.com\/docs\/actions\/steps\/system#mail). Though I've personally managed to almost escape my twenties having yet to endure an email-heavy job, I still find the practice of sending topical\/sacred information to myself to be the upmost reliable and direct means of retrieving it.\n\nAs I've configured it, within Drafts on any of its 3 platforms, all I need do is press `^M` to have the text of the current Draft sent instantly to an iCloud Mail alias I use for such things. \n\n<video controls width=\"520\" height=auto>\n  <source src=\"https:\/\/user-images.githubusercontent.com\/43663476\/189148302-688897be-b837-4f94-b5ea-c89972516c5a.MOV\">\n<\/video>\n\nIf I were sending to more folks than just myself on a regular basis, I'd definitely make use of Drafts' [Mail Action Wizard](https:\/\/tools.getdrafts.com\/wizards\/mail) to help simplify and solidify the process of creating a dedicated action, which almost certainly *would not* have the `Send in Background` toggle selected, as demonstrated, for the sake of giving myself a preview of outbound messages to... important folks. For macOS users, there's also a bespoke Catalyst app called [Mail Assistant](https:\/\/docs.getdrafts.com\/misc\/mail-assistant), which I've yet to try.\n\n## Formatting\n\nThe parameters of [the Mail action step](https:\/\/docs.getdrafts.com\/docs\/actions\/steps\/system#mail) can be filled with any combination of items from [the original Drafts template tags array](https:\/\/docs.getdrafts.com\/docs\/actions\/templates\/drafts-templates) *or* from the relatively new set of [mustache template tags](https:\/\/docs.getdrafts.com\/docs\/actions\/templates\/mustache.html).\n\nhttps:\/\/gist.github.com\/extratone\/8cc2cd8cc7b8e95a80f9e60b5fe71bd4\n\nThe current version of [my personal Send-to-Self action](https:\/\/directory.getdrafts.com\/a\/1wR) sent [this example result](https:\/\/app.sparkmailapp.com\/web-share\/GFZ2OLZskkVOrDVslliHP_H7lalF_81dS00IvpJv) using the format represented in the Gist embedded above. If you'd like, you can wrap the [body] tag (or any part of the message, actually) in double %s and select the `Send as HTML` toggle to have the result rendered as HTML. (See [this example](https:\/\/app.sparkmailapp.com\/web-share\/elWlx8eNRiw1nWICBT5p7eGcTs5XZsFO6-JuM1n1).)\n\n![Setting a Drafts Mail-to-Self-specific rule on iCloud Mail on the Web](https:\/\/user-images.githubusercontent.com\/43663476\/190239278-4f5e7f12-37c1-4ad9-9c2e-7d7e76000f88.png)\n\nIf - like me - you're an iCloud Mail user primarily from iOS\/iPadOS, here's how to create an iCloud Mail rule for messages you've sent yourself from Drafts:\n\n1. Visit [iCloud.com\/mail](https:\/\/www.icloud.com\/mail\/) in your web browser and authenticate.\n2. Open the Rules settings menu by tapping the gear icon in the upper left ⇨ Preferences ⇨ Rules.\n3. Create a new rule with the \"Add rule\" link.\n4. By default, the \"If a message...\" field selection should be \"is from.\" In the text entry field, enter `drafts-mail@drafts5.agiletortoise.com`.\n5. By default, the \"Then...\" field selection is \"Move to Folder.\" I have personally set mine to \"Move to Folder and Mark as Read,\" but this depends on your preference. Select a folder or mailbox for Drafts messages to be moved to and click \"Add.\"\n\n## Publishing via Email\n\nI've spent a lot of time this year working on integrating Drafts with [NeoCities](https:\/\/bilge.world\/using-drafts-with-neocities), [Write.as](https:\/\/bilge.world\/automating-writeas-posts), and other publishing services, but - for new users, especially - Drafts' mail integration offers a pathway to publishing with virtually zero configuration for those services who still offer mail-to-save\/post email addresses. These include [WordPress](https:\/\/wordpress.com\/support\/post-by-email\/), [Blogger](https:\/\/support.google.com\/blogger\/answer\/154172?hl=en#:~:text=Click%20Save.-,to%20post%20by%20email%3A,-Important%3A%20Anyone%20who), [Write.as](https:\/\/howto.write.as\/publish-via-email), [LiveJournal](https:\/\/www.livejournal.com\/support\/faq\/187.html), [Evernote](https:\/\/help.evernote.com\/hc\/en-us\/articles\/360050995914), [Day One](https:\/\/dayoneapp.com\/guides\/tips-and-tutorials\/create-entries-with-email\/), [Things](https:\/\/culturedcode.com\/things\/support\/articles\/2908262\/), [Todoist](https:\/\/www.keepproductive.com\/blog\/email-tasks-into-todoist), and more.\n\nPerhaps the easiest method of setting this up would involve finding your private email address for a given service(s), pasting them in the aforementioned [Mail Action Wizard](https:\/\/tools.getdrafts.com\/wizards\/mail), titling the action by the name of the service, and installing. There's also an [Email to Myself action](https:\/\/actions.getdrafts.com\/a\/1Mr) on the Drafts Action Directory to get you started.\n\n<video controls width=\"520\" height=auto>\n  <source src=\"https:\/\/user-images.githubusercontent.com\/43663476\/189246053-c53d970a-a6ea-48da-8878-116d0abf2a2b.MOV\">\n<\/video>\n\n### Drag and Drop to *Formatted* Markdown Hyperlinks from Apple Mail\n\nGoing the other direction, users of Apple Mail (the client) might find it pleasantly surprising that one can drag a message from Mail into Drafts in order to automatically create a markdown-formatted hyperlink that opens said message from anywhere.\n\nFor more details, see the official [**'Sending Mail with Drafts' Integration

the environment can be reproduced months or even years later.\n\n- Pinned packages in a requirements.txt file are denoted by `==`. For example, `requests==2.21.0`. Pinned packages should never be updated except for a very good reason, such as to fix a critical bug or vulnerability.\n- Conversely, unpinned packages are typically denoted by `>=`, which indicates that the package can be replaced by a later version. Unpinned packages are more common in development environments, where the latest version can offer bug fixes, security patches and even new functionality.\n\nAs packages age, many of them are likely to have vulnerabilities and bugs logged against them. In order to maintain the security and performance of your application, you’ll need to update these packages to a newer version that fixes the issue.\n\nThe [pip package manager] can be used to update one or more packages system-wide.

Check that Python is installed\n\nBefore packages can be updated, ensure that a Python installation containing the necessary files needed for updating packages is in place by following the steps outlined in \"[Using Python on Windows]\" in the official documentation.\n\n2. Get a list of all the outdated packages\n\nTo generate a list of all outdated packages:\n\n```shell\npip list --outdated\n```\n\n3. Upgrade outdated packages\n\nDepending on your operating system or virtual environment, refer to the following sections.\n\nThe easiest way to update all packages in a Windows environment is to use pip in conjunction with Windows PowerShell:\n\n1. Open a command shell by typing `powershell` in the Search Box of the Task bar\n2. Enter:\n\n```shell\npip freeze | %{$_.split('==')[0]} | %{pip install --upgrade $_}\n\n```\n\nThis will upgrade all packages system-wide to the latest version available in the Python Package Index (PyPI).\n\n## Update all Python Packages on Linux\n\nLinux provides a number of ways to use pip in order to upgrade Python packages, including grep and awk.\n\nTo upgrade all packages using pip with grep on Ubuntu Linux:\n\n```shell\npip3 list --outdated --format=freeze | grep -v '^\\-e' | cut -d = -f 1 | xargs -n1 pip3 install -U\n```\n\nTo upgrade all packages using pip with awk on Ubuntu Linux:\n\n```shell\npip3 list -o | cut -f1 -d' ' | tr \" \" \"\\n\" | awk '{if(NR>=3)print)' | cut -d' ' -f1 | xargs -n1 pip3 install -U\n```\n\n## Updating Python Packages on Windows or Linux\n\nPip can be used to upgrade all packages on either Windows or Linux:\n\n1. Output a list of installed packages into a requirements file (requirements.txt):\n\n```shell\npip freeze > requirements.txt\n```\n\n1. Edit requirements.txt, and replace all ‘==’ with ‘>=’. Use the ‘Replace All’ command in the editor.\n2. Upgrade all outdated packages:\n\n```shell\npip install -r requirements.txt --upgrade\n```\n\n## Updating all Packages in a Virtual Environment\n\nThe easiest way to update unpinned packages (i.e., packages that do not require a specific version) in a virtual environment is to run the following Python script that makes use of pip:\n\n```python\nimport pkg_resources from subprocess import call for dist in pkg_resources.working_set:     call(\"python -m pip install --upgrade \" + dist.<projectname>, shell=True)\n```\n\n## Updating all Packages in a Pipenv Environment\n\nThe simplest way to update all the unpinned packages in a specific virtual environment created with pipenv is to do the following steps:\n\n1. Activate the Pipenv shell that contains the packages to be upgraded:\n\n```shell\npipenv shell\npipenv update\n```","views":49,"updated":"2022-09-25T10:27:32Z","tags":[],"type":null,"title":"","slug":"how-to-update-all-python-packages","appearance":"norm","language":"","rtl":false,"created":"2022-09-25T10:27:32Z","paid":false},{"id":"7o38tmazayyyr4m5","body":"Updated `09252022-060349`\r\n\r\n- [Source](https:\/\/www.activestate.com\/resources\/quick-reads\/how-to-update-=\r\nall-python-packages\/)\r\n- [WTF](https:\/\/davidblue.wtf\/drafts\/EFF9B7B5-25A6-4B07-8860-EFDB587D87BB.h=\r\ntml)\r\n- [Archive](http:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20220925091221\/https:\/\/www.activesta=\r\nte.com\/resources\/quick-reads\/how-to-update-all-python-packages\/)\r\n- [pip Update Shortcut](drafts:\/\/open?uuid=3D84F3BCEE-4BA4-43B3-A85E-45EA84=\r\n10FA19)\r\n- [Medium](https:\/\/medium.com\/handset\/how-to-update-all-python-packages-wit=\r\nh-a-single-pip-command-dc0657f0dc7d)\r\n- [Telegraph](https:\/\/telegra.ph\/How-to-Update-all-Python-Packages-with-a-S=\r\ningle-pip-Command-09-25)\r\n- [How to Update All Python Packages](https:\/\/chaff.writeas.com\/how-to-upda=\r\nte-all-python-packages)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**Shell Commands**\r\n\r\n```shell\r\npip list --outdated\r\npip freeze | %{$_.split('=3D=3D')[0]} | %{pip install --upgrade $_}\r\npip3 list --outdated --format=3Dfreeze | grep -v '^\\-e' | cut -d =3D -f 1 |=\r\n xargs -n1 pip3 install -U\r\npip3 list -o | cut -f1 -d' ' | tr \" \" \"\\n\" | awk '{if(NR>=3D3)print)' | cut=\r\n -d' ' -f1 | xargs -n1 pip3 install -U\r\npip freeze > requirements.txt\r\npip install -r requirements.txt --upgrade\r\npipenv shell\r\npipenv update\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Python Script**\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport pkg_resources from subprocess import call for dist in pkg_resources.=\r\nworking_set:     call(\"python -m pip install --upgrade \" + dist.<projectnam=\r\ne>, shell=3DTrue)\r\n```\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n![PsalmsPyPi](https:\/\/user-images.githubusercontent.com\/43663476\/192139585-=\r\n4ab7baac-b9c3-4ab4-a334-3eea9e9a85df.png)\r\n\r\n# How to Update All Python Packages\r\n\r\nWith Python, the best practice of pinning all the packages in an environmen=\r\nt at a specific version ensures that the environment can be reproduced mont=\r\nhs or even years later.\r\n\r\n- Pinned packages in a requirements.txt file are denoted by `=3D=3D`.

Not infrequently their professions are related to the same theme, and may deal directly or indirectly with young people. January 27 people are usually highly concerned with what is new and keeping young themselves.\n\nOne associated problem often encountered by January 27 people is that of premature development—obviously the greatest danger in childhood is that they be exploited or pushed too fast. Not infrequently their projects develop too quickly, their ideas manifest too suddenly, their financial affairs expand too precipitously.\n\nBecause those born on this day are psychologically predisposed to speedy decisions, it may be very difficult for them to maintain control over their affairs. In their interpersonal relationships, as well, they may push both friendships and romantic attachments too quickly, thus creating an uncomfortable, albeit exciting situation for the other person involved. Sweeping others off their feet with a kind of tumultuous energy is typical of January 27 people.\n\nAbove all, those born on this day must learn patience and discrimination. Not all of their work is of the highest calibre, though they expect it to be and can firmly believe it is. Unless January 27 people pay careful attention to the opinions and reactions of others they may suffer disappointment and rejection. In addition they must learn not only what they can do, but also who they are. Cultivating a realistic outlook toward life is essential for them if they wish to be successful in the world.\n\nFor January 27 people, keeping their childlike nature satisfied can be a full time job in itself. They may be accused more than once in their lives of being overenthusiastic, juvenile, childish or even infantile in their emotional attitudes. All maturing experiences—having children themselves, conjugal sex, sharing household duties and responsibilities, holding a job, are both a challenge and opportunity for growth. If those born on this day get stuck in any of the developmental stages of childhood, they run the risk of being an eternal Peter Pan, i.e., never growing up. As charming a role as this may seem, it can wear thin when they find themselves in middle age.\n\nIt is not uncommon that January 27 people undergo maturity crises at the ages of twenty-eight, thirty-six or forty-two, when they are faced by stark choices as to whether they wish to fully accept adult responsibilities or not. Such decisions can only be made by the January 27 person him\/herself and cannot be forced. Those born on this day must come to realize that retaining youth need not conflict with a maturing and strengthening of character. Working with children and young people, starting new projects and studying the process of learning and creativity can all help to sustain their youthful needs in a healthy fashion.\n\n### Health\n\nThose born on January 27 may be prone to various childhood maladies, some of which can spell lasting difficulties into their adult life. Therefore, parents who have children born on this day must take special care to treat their illnesses swiftly and intelligently. Later in life January 27 people are particularly prone to difficulties with their nervous and circulatory systems, which may in fact be related to each other. Keeping themselves in good shape with a sensible, down-to-earth, varied diet and seeing that they get proper dietary supplements is a great help. In addition, regular physical exercise in the open air is essential, whenever possible.\n\n### Numerology\n\nThose born on the 27th of the month are ruled by the number 9 (2+7=9), and by the planet Mars. The number 9 is powerful in its influence on other numbers (any number added to 9 yields that number (e.g., 5+9=14, 4+1=5) and any number multiplied by 9 yields a 9 (e.g., 9x5=45, 4+5=9). The planet Mars is forceful and aggressive, and Number 9 people thus have the capacity to envelop situations. The combination of Mars with Uranus (ruler of Aquarius) can indicate marked mental abilities but leave January 27 people cool or unemotional most of the time, with periodic, and often childish, outbursts.\n\n### Tarot\n\nThe 9th card of the Major Arcana is The Hermit, who is usually depicted walking with a lantern and a stick—he represents meditation, isolation and quietude. The Hermit also signifies crystallized wisdom and ultimate discipline. The Hermit is a taskmaster who motivates by conscience and guides others on their path. The positive indications of this card are stick-to-it-iveness, purpose, profundity and concentration; negative qualities include dogmatism, intolerance, mistrust and discouragement. For January 27 people, the negative characteristics are a warning to those who would hold on to past accomplishments and fail to mature.\n\n## The Week of Genius\n\n- **PRECOCIOUS**\n- **UNIQUE**\n- **SELF‑TAUGHT**\t\n\n- **DISTRACTED**\n- **RECKLESS**\n- **STRESSED‑OUT**\n\n### Advice\n\n- Clarify a realistic picture of yourself in your mind’s eye.\n- A certain amount of undesirable personal interaction is always necessary; try to be a bit more thick-skinned, and if necessary, downright insensitive.\n- Cultivate calm, patience and persistence rather than always going your own way.\n- Learn to handle frustration and be tough enough to quietly demand the very best for yourself.\n\n---\n\nAlthough those born during the Week of Genius may not necessarily be more intelligent than others in the year, they generally learn quickly and exhibit an alert, even high-strung demeanor. Like thoroughbreds, they are hot-blooded types, usually champing at the bit to get on with it. Patience is not one of their virtues, and they show a marked itchiness with those slower sorts who need time to express themselves and make decisions.\n\nThey often arouse other people’s amazement, and also jealousy, due to the speed and ease with which they pick things up at the first go. When they are young, this ability may manifest as precocity, but parents and teachers who do not understand them may criticize them as superficial, and for lacking the staying power to see a project through. But although it is true that they are easily bored, they are quite capable of perseverance when they feel it is warranted. Not all of them have the ability to learn so fast, but most value mental skills highly and try to develop them, whether natural or not. They also prize education, but not always the kind found in school: they believe that experience is the best teacher and are often self-taught. The lure of worldly excitement will often entice them away from the classroom, and travel to foreign lands can have a peculiar fascination for them.\n\nIn their careers, they want to have things their own way. They rarely do well in jobs where they are told what to do. Self-employment or independent positions suit them better, particularly if their work allows them the freedom to make choices, plan, change direction, follow their instincts and be true to what they believe. Although they can be excellent leaders, whether of families and social groups or in their professional environments, they have no essential need to either rule or dominate. Their greatest need in relation to other people may actually be just the need for attention, since every performer ultimately needs an audience.\n\nIt is extremely important for them to give every project they work on their own personal stamp. People who enjoy the individual expression of others are fond of them, but their often destabilizing and self-centered energies can affect group projects adversely. They often seem rebellious, but this is usually because of some attempt to tame or control them. Their impulsiveness can easily bring them into conflict with authority figures, or with those of a more conservative nature.\n\nOnce they accept their uniqueness and realize that their social needs and drives are less deep than they think, they will make great strides in their careers. The more enlightened may come to realize they can use their strengths best by pursuing a career that does not necessarily involve social contact. There are many areas of science, music, art, publishing or economics that can fit the bill. Part of the problem they confront in working with others is that they tend to exhaust their talents and energies on those close to them, sometimes in a frustrated effort to fit in and feel that they really belong to a group.\n\nOn the negative side, they have a tendency toward self-destructiveness. They are more hurtful to themselves than to others. They can be emotionally unstable, and at times can appear distracted, wired, self-absorbed, and can be easily upset. Their sensitivity to external stimuli may be pronounced in such moods, and they may have an acute need to withdraw to a quiet place, away from the bustle of the world. Easily stressed out, even prone to periodic breakdowns, they must learn to toughen themselves. If they can become less easily aroused, they will deal more effectively with the exigencies of everyday life.\n\nIn matters of love, they insist that their mates understand their need for freedom. They will not be tied down to fixed routines and schedules. Friends and lovers with more demanding expectations of them are in for a rude surprise; rarely will they accept restriction. Chafing at constraint, they may just try to find another free spirit to get involved with, a solution that may work in the short term but seldom provides the stability and permanence required for deeper commitment. Some may indeed desire a permanent, faithful, giving and stable partner but may also seek the freedom to carry on all kinds of other relationships, sexual or otherwise, at the same time. By practicing this kind of double standard, these people seek to satisfy both their needs and their desires, but they also show their disregard for others.\n\nThose born during the Week of Genius who choose family life will have to learn to direct their energies efficiently, share responsibilities, budget their time and, above all, conquer their need for attention. Their charismatic side often attracts the wrong kind of people, and this may keep their energy from those whom they love and who really need it, particularly family members. Restricting themselves to a well-chosen circle of close friends, and concentrating on those who have a stabilizing effect on them psychologically and are not needy people, will contribute greatly to their happiness.\n\n## Co-Star\n\n![PNG conversion of a PDF capture of my Co-Star profile.](co-star.png \"@neoyokel on Co-Star\")\n\n- [Co-Star Profile](https:\/\/www.costarastrology.com\/neoyokel \"@neoyokel on Co-Star\")\n- [Export](https:\/\/davidblue.wtf\/costar\/export \"Co-Star Profile PDF Export\")\n- [MicroBlog](https:\/\/dieselgoth.micro.blog\/2022\/10\/03\/costar.html \"Co-Star on MicroBlog\")\n- [Medium](https:\/\/extratone.medium.com\/7b0284a45b0d \"Co-Star documentation on Medium\")\n\n### Sun\n\n> The sun determines your ego, identity, and \"role\" in life. It's the core of who you are, and is the sign you're most likely to already know. \n\nYour Sun is in **Aquarius**, meaning you are fundamentally unconventional and anti. Comfortable dissenting or straying from the norm, your intellectual talent of abstraction is oriented towards pushing the boundaries of what seems reasonable. You carry a lot on your shoulders and have need to fight for the underdog. It's in your seventh house, meaning you feel the need to distinguish yourself from others through close relationships and long-term partnerships.\n\n### Ascendant\n\n> Your ascendant is the \"mask\" you present to people. It can be seen in your personal style and how you come off to people when you first meet. Some say it becomes less relevant as you get older. It changes every two hours, so if it doesn't make sense, text your mom to confirm your birth time. \n\nYour Ascendant is in **Leo**, meaning you come across as bright, good-natured, and magnetic. Your energy makes you seem either like a know-it-all or a live wire—but always the center of attention.\n\n### Moon\n\n> The moon rules your emotions, moods, and feelings. This is likely the sign you most think of yourself as, since it reflects your personality when you're alone or deeply comfortable.\n\nYour Moon is in **Leo**, meaning your emotional self is dramatic, proud, expressive, idealistic, and somewhat self-centered. You need a lot of love, care, and validation from other people. It's in your first house, meaning you find security and safety through your self and self-image—and, because it's your first house, your Moon in Leo is hyper-present in your personality.\n\n### Mercury\n\n> Mercury determines how you communicate, talk, think, and process information. It also indicates how you learn. It is the mind's planet.\n\nYour Mercury is in **Aquarius**, meaning your intellect is insightful, unconventional, and super meta. You have a rich imagination that allows you to think in a way that is abstracted from daily life. You enjoy intellectual banter, though you sometimes push your ideas on others. It's in your seventh house, meaning you are curious about and inclined to analyze your closest relationships and how they affect you.\n\n### Venus\n\n> Venus determines how and what you love. It indicates how you express affection and the qualities you're attracted to.\n\nYour Venus is in **Aquarius**, meaning your romantic side is unconventional, intellectual, and somewhat detached. You can be bubbly and obvious when you like someone, but typically you prefer forms of intimacy less obvious than romance. It's in your seventh house, meaning that for you, love is often expressed in close relationships and long-term partnerships.\n\n### Mars\n\n> Mars is the planet of aggression. It determines how you assert yourself, take action, and the energy that surrounds you—particularly in your sex life, your ambitiousness, and when you're angry.\n\nYour Mars is in **Capricorn**, meaning you assert yourself in a way that is responsible and efficient, and you think things through very intentionally. Highly motivated by ambition, your rationality sometimes seems soulless. It's in your sixth house, meaning you put a lot of energy into routines.\n\n### Uranus\n\n> Uranus stays in each sign for seven years, meaning it rules a generation more than a person. It rules innovation, rebellion, and progress.\n\nYour Uranus is in **Capricorn**, meaning other generations are shocked by your generation's sense of responsibility, seriousness, rationality, and hunger for power. It's in your sixth house, meaning that for you, this manifests in rebelling against dated expectations about routines.\n\n### Neptune\n\n> Neptune stays in each sign for around fourteen years, meaning it rules a generation more than a person. It rules dreams, imagination, and the unconscious. \n\nYour Neptune is in **Capricorn**, meaning your entire generation finds inspiration through hard work, responsibility, seriousness, and ambition. It's in your sixth house, meaning that for you, this manifests in your ideal—verging on unrealistic and impractical—about routines.\n\n### Pluto\n\n> Pluto stays in each sign for up to thirty years, meaning it rules a generation more than a person. It rules power, intensity, obsession, and control.\n\nYour Pluto is in **Scorpio**, meaning your generation's psyche is comparatively passionate, intense, serious, private, self-obsessed, and perceptive. It's in your fifth house, meaning you personally are transforming outdated definitions of romance, creativity, and pleasure.\n\n## *Bewildering* - Aquarius Sun, Leo Moon\nThe combination of Aquarius Sun and Leo Moon signs produces the sort of personality that is always there to help people in need; a true humanitarian. Because this trait is so strong in your nature, you’re a bit of an easy mark for con men or other friends and family that would take advantage. You are the one people come to when they have problems and need help. You are proud, independent, and self-reliant, and you don’t like to have your original good opinion of people upset. Because of this, you keep a bad bargain and perhaps stay with a relationship that has gone sour. There are times, thanks to your deeply emotional but expansive and friendly nature, that you need to be hard-headed and practical in dealing with people, particularly in handling people making demands on your time or money.\n\nThis combination blends the originality and independence of Aquarius with the emotional warmth and confidence of Leo. Born near a full Moon, you possess the inclination to project your personality into the world or affairs. Sensitive and affectionate, marriage strongly influences your life. Naturally friendly, you have a great capacity for kindness and sympathy, and you love very deeply. Sometimes romantic interests may cloud your judgment and ability for practical action. Just the same, these are both fixed signs, and you are very hard to convince against your will.\n\nYou follow your inner feelings and can be positive and determined when you feel you are right. As a leader, you employ a style of warm and affection rather than by using more stern and harsher methods. You have a tendency to be impulsive and jump to conclusions, often making decisions without due forethought.\n\nPrinciple means a great deal to you and you are strongly influenced by this and by your feelings, affections, and emotions. Success comes most easily, however, when you can keep your emotions under the control of your intellect.\n\nCommon to every Aquarius-Leo is confusion about who you are or who you should be. However most finally resolve their difficulties by striking a balance. Instead of denying yourself the rank and authority you long for, you will pursue an ambitious life. Nevertheless, you will always remain thoughtful and sympathetic in your dealings with others. You are a nice individual, a friend to everyone, and you treat others as equals because of your Aquarian nature. However your Leo inner self is solid, dignified, and controlling. In actual fact, you want to be the leader and exercise that authority.\n\nYou waver between assertiveness and over- accommodation, authority and compliance, but you want to be loved and valued by everyone, which often holds you back. The two signs of your combination are totally different in essence and character, which gives you a multifaceted personality with many inner battles. Your combination indicates great force, dedication, and purposefulness as well as a lot of intelligence. You are always unsure of whether to rely on your heart or your mind, but decision making may be hard for you.\n\nAs with all Aquarians, you see things from a separate, intellectual perspective. However, because your Leo inner nature is very emotional, your heart nearly always has the last word in your life. Many Aquarius-Leos are attracted to the metaphysical and occult and are frequently members of religious cults offering instant salvation. Your extraordinary imagination and self-governing spirit need a constructive outlet for expression. Both of your signs are fixed signs so you must be careful that obstinacy, arrogance, and bigotry do not stand in your path to success. Like all Leos you long for admiration and attention and you have a strong sense of the theatrical, but your sporadic ostentation and kookiness are often funny.\n\nYou are prone to behaving on sudden, random hunches because you are impulsive. Unfortunately this often turns out to be catastrophic. Finally, through trial and error, you do well in anything you try, even though you are forgetful and absentminded. You do learn from experience. Dedication is one of your preferred words. Devoted and honest, you are not happy until you have mastered whatever you do. Your youth was probably a disaster or limited in some way. Senseless revolt and inner chaos, especially in your youth, may have been the result.\n\n---\n\n```\nulysses:\/\/x-callback-url\/open?id=2bbolpkvVV6uqlSgsOeDuA\nulysses:\/\/x-callback-url\/open?id=LdSt3TzESsYZ5Gpdw_HMVQ\nulysses:\/\/x-callback-url\/open?id=lre2sTNZovhtrTGJSNvhAQ\nulysses:\/\/x-callback-url\/open?id=ek5rflK4Q5My-HEgtFmPwQ\nulysses:\/\/x-callback-url\/open?id=FH5ZPSrk8Q4bdsOj0Vq3xA\n```","views":58,"updated":"2022-10-03T17:16:14Z","tags":[],"type":null,"title":"","slug":"david-blue-astrology-reference","appearance":"norm","language":"","rtl":false,"created":"2022-10-03T17:16:14Z","paid":false},{"id":"wiypivisgwopk3tv","body":"https:\/\/www.icloud.com\/shortcuts\/b691fd5aa9734696bd532f3890a214c4\r\nhttps:\/\/www.icloud.com\/shortcuts\/1cea805567be4ad49c431f60e13c3255\r\nhttps:\/\/www.icloud.com\/shortcuts\/6ce6927c67324491b61d519a7ab9a951\r\nhttps:\/\/www.icloud.com\/shortcuts\/e1c960e3a2aa4cfca7c7eefc3ab46df0\r\nhttps:\/\/www.icloud.com\/shortcuts\/a88709dfef6b429da2076e532fdf8d55\r\nhttps:\/\/www.icloud.com\/shortcuts\/872a4eb3885d4f5096aba7792ae2b9c2\r\nhttps:\/\/www.icloud.com\/shortcuts\/0b412fc1ef7e4968982641896be96e10\r\nhttps:\/\/www.icloud.com\/shortcuts\/6cf309b60b4c445482574abe46254ed7\r\nhttps:\/\/www.icloud.com\/shortcuts\/68bffadbb6304462bce244fd82fa0a8d\r\nhttps:\/\/www.icloud.com\/shortcuts\/fc74bb390238409a893e152d094f1d89\r\nhttps:\/\/www.icloud.com\/shortcuts\/a93db74e520740928dfad0ade7a6bbed\r\nhttps:\/\/www.icloud.com\/shortcuts\/ec740c7557864c47bd5f77b93a121c92\r\nhttps:\/\/www.icloud.com\/shortcuts\/d01dbf32c4eb457d889c344ad4443db5\r\nhttps:\/\/www.icloud.com\/shortcuts\/a08f83af182f43e982d7db47025cc4d9\r\nhttps:\/\/www.icloud.com\/shortcuts\/95f17ecb08424598b62ba71cfdd00c05\r\nhttps:\/\/www.icloud.com\/shortcuts\/d912e5d5ad8440bb86a9f66a390312e5\r\n{\r\n

(Required)\n2. Set any additional Drafts tags you'd like included beyond the issue's current labels. (Optional.)\n\n## Retrieve and concatenate GitHub Issue contents and comments into a single draft.\n\nSee: [**The Full Documentation**](https:\/\/davidblue.wtf\/issuedraft) \n\n[![GitHubImage-Draft Source Render](https:\/\/user-images.githubusercontent.com\/43663476\/194393714-12912a27-3f5e-4384-a2cb-3fed9754bcda.png)](https:\/\/davidblue.wtf\/issuedraft\/source)\n\nThis shortcut is yet another near-direct publication of one I made specifically for my own use cases. It uses [GitHub's REST API](https:\/\/docs.github.com\/en\/rest\/issues) to gather an Issue's content - of the original post as well as all of the comments - into a single markdown document, formatted very specifically for my own use. Out of the box, it's designed to store said document in [Drafts](https:\/\/apps.apple.com\/us\/app\/drafts\/id1236254471), but even the most novice Shortcuts users should find pointing it to any other destination with markdown\/plain text support very simple. (If you need help, please don't hesitate to contact me via any of the sources at the bottom of this page.)\n\n### Setup\n\nUpon installation, you'll be asked to provide:\n\n1. A [GitHub Personal Access Token](https:\/\/docs.github.com\/en\/authentication\/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure\/creating-a-personal-access-token) (create one directly with [this link](https:\/\/github.com\/settings\/tokens\/new).) This is absolutely required.\n2. Any additional [tags](https:\/\/docs.getdrafts.com\/docs\/drafts\/tagging.html) you'd like attached to the resulting draft *beyond the Issue's labels* (which are attached as tags by default.) These are optional.\n\nThe shortcut is configured by default to receive Issue URLs from the [Share Sheet](https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/design\/human-interface-guidelines\/components\/menus-and-actions\/activity-views\/) and\/or the system clipboard. Theoretically, it should remain unaffected if one should accidentally pass an Issue *Comment* URL (ex: `https:\/\/github.com\/mastodon\/joinmastodon\/issues\/148#issuecomment-1114188033`) instead of the Issue URL (ex: `https:\/\/github.com\/mastodon\/joinmastodon\/issues\/148`,) as the [Get Item from List](https:\/\/matthewcassinelli.com\/actions\/get-item-from-list\/) actions which parse out the specifying information seek by index from the root.\n\n### Format\n\nWith Shortcuts variables wrapped in `}{`:\n\n```\n# \"{title}\" - {owner}\/{repo}\nUpdated `{updated}`\nCreated `{created}`\n\n- [**Issue**]({link})\n- @[{username}](https:\/\/github.com\/{username})\n- [Repository](https:\/\/github.com\/{owner}\/{repo})\n- [Maintainer\/Org](https:\/\/github.com\/{owner})\n\n---\n\n{body}\n\n{commentContent1}\n *{ref1}*\n\n---\n{commentContent2}\n *{ref2}*\n\n---\n{commentContent3}\n *{ref3}*\n\n---\n```\n\nBelow is actual demonstrative shortcut output from [this Issue](https:\/\/github.com\/FifiTheBulldog\/ios-settings-urls\/issues\/10) as input.

I can only speak to my reasons—but I suspect they’re similar across the industry.\n\nXCB support was a significant extra maintenance burden that was both fragile and largely unused (I don’t have the analytics to be certain, but I strongly suspect Tusker’s had literally zero usage because it had been broken for quite some time and no one reported it.).\n\nTusker’s XCB support predates parameterized shortcuts (indeed, that inability was the impetus for building it) and it has not kept up well over the past years of architectural changes to the app. Combined with the fact that the iOS automation\/power-user scene has almost entirely moved to Shortcuts.app, the cost of maintaining a parallel and unused set of functionality isn’t worth it.\n\nAs I push toward an App Store release after over 4 years of development, I’m trying to make sure everything is in a good, long-term stable place—and the XCB implementation was not.\n\nTusker’s Shortcuts support is currently lacking, but I intend to add functionality comparable to what was previously possible with XCB URLs, so you won’t be without automation forever.\n\n—Shadowfacts\n\n> On Oct 10, 2022, at 2:41 PM, David Blue <davidblue@extratone.com> wrote:  \n>\n> Hello!  \n> I realize it's honestly a bit incredulous that I'm choosing this of all Tusker topics to actually reach out to you about for the first time but...  \n> I happened to catch this at the bottom of the release notes for today's Testflight build:  \n> > X-Callback-URL support has been removed.  \n> ...and dang... frankly, I was just very very saddened and upset with myself for having managed to miss its implementation in the first place!  \n> This, however, is not a complaint email, nor even a suggestion email, actually.

(I'm sure you can imagine why.)  \n> I don't know anything about you except what I've seen in Tusker, and it is more than enough to compel me to ask you, specifically...  \n> Is there some overarching reason why folks have now begun actively removing their X-Callback-URL support instead of (frankly) just forgetting about it?  \n> Obviously, I consider any time of yours spent answering this to be purely a favor, so it does not come with anything like obligation or time-sensitivity.  \n> I am kinda starting to worry about the issue tho lol.  \n> Thanks for your time!  \n> 𝗗𝗮𝘃𝗶𝗱 𝗕𝗹𝘂𝗲  ","views":53,"updated":"2022-10-11T16:08:05Z","tags":[],"type":null,"title":"","slug":"re-x-callback-url-support-in-tusker","appearance":"norm","language":"","rtl":false,"created":"2022-10-11T16:08:05Z","paid":false},{"id":"pmt2jqhv748c3077","body":"# x-callback-url Specification\nUpdated `10222022-062301`\n\n- [**Source**](http:\/\/x-callback-url.com\/specifications)\n- [Gist](https:\/\/gist.github.com\/extratone\/34266b4ba55ec831b03b00a99af36acb)\n- [Drafts](drafts:\/\/open?uuid=CAABBB06-186C-437D-BC30-65844BDBEC2B)\n- [WTF](https:\/\/davidblue.wtf\/drafts\/CAABBB06-186C-437D-BC30-65844BDBEC2B.html)\n- [WTF Shortlink](https:\/\/davidblue.wtf\/xspec) - `https:\/\/davidblue.wtf\/xspec`\n- [Local](shareddocuments:\/\/\/private\/var\/mobile\/Library\/Mobile%20Documents\/com~apple~CloudDocs\/Written\/6991B139-1D32-4ADD-85D3-B578D1A4542E.md)\n- [~](https:\/\/tilde.town\/~extratone\/manual\/x\/index.html@p=7.html)\n- [Telegraph](https:\/\/telegra.ph\/xspec-10-22)\n- [Notion](https:\/\/rotund.notion.site\/1-0-DRAFT-Spec-x-callback-url-09e1ffdf62d044928df86c4225eaabe6)\n- [Archive](http:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20221022091703\/http:\/\/x-callback-url.com\/specifications\/)\n- [Ulysses](ulysses:\/\/x-callback-url\/open?id=46he1rVEdNFPjIM6PaTeBQ)\n- [Simplenote Local](simplenote:\/\/note\/5ff6170a24dd4a0997122f8f3602c5fa)\n- [Simplenote Publish](http:\/\/simp.ly\/publish\/TWp6fc)\n- [Obsidian](obsidian:\/\/open?vault=OBSHIDDIAN&file=drafts%2F6991B139-1D32-4ADD-85D3-B578D1A4542E)\n- [Things](things:\/\/\/show?id=Scs4L2NM8w4Uy22YPubAKm)\n\n---\n\n<script src=\"https:\/\/gist.github.com\/extratone\/34266b4ba55ec831b03b00a99af36acb.js\"><\/script>\n\n---\n\n# x-callback-url 1.0 DRAFT Spec\n\nThe x-callback-url specification is intended to standardize the use of URLs and registered URL schemes for inter-app communication and messaging on Apple’s iOS platforms.\n\n## Revisions\n\nR3: Added “Security Concerns” section.\n\nR2: Added optional “x-cancel” parameter. When supported, this parameter would include a URL to open when the user indicated they want to cancel the action. The action did not succeed, nor generate an error, but the user just wishes to return to the source app.\n\nR1: Removed the “version” from the URL path. The current recommendation if versioning of an x-callback-url API is required would be to register separate URL schemes for each version. This method allows the calling app to determine which versions are available via calls to “canOpenURL”.\n\n## Discussion\n\niOS runs apps in sandboxes which providing limited means of communication between apps directly on the device. Shared files, messaging systems and other similar solutions used on desktop and server operating systems are not present in iOS.\n\niOS does provide the ability for apps to [register URL schemes](http:\/\/developer.apple.com\/library\/ios\/#documentation\/iPhone\/Conceptual\/iPhoneOSProgrammingGuide\/StandardBehaviors\/StandardBehaviors.html%23\/\/apple*ref\/doc\/uid\/TP40007072-Ch3-SW26). Many apps already use the feature to launch other apps and pass basic data in the URL parameters, but there is no standard for structure of these URLs and no current standard for allowing callbacks to be pass in the URL if the originating app wishes to receive some result based on the action.\n\nThe goal of the x-callback-url specification is to provide a standardized means for iOS developers to expose and document the methods they make available to other apps. Using x-callback-url’s source apps can launch other apps passing data and context information, and also provide parameters instructing the target app to return data and control back to the source app after executing an action. Specific supported actions will be dependent on the individual apps and will not be discussed in the specification.\n\nApps using x-callback-url should provide support for receiving action URLs in the format described below. Details on implementation and sample code will also be available on the x-callback-url website.\n\nNote that starting with iOS 8, Apple has introduced [App Extensions](https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/library\/ios\/documentation\/General\/Conceptual\/ExtensibilityPG\/index.html#\/\/apple*ref\/doc\/uid\/TP40014214) which address some of the requirements for inter-app communication in a vendor supported way. There are still areas where URL schemes make more sense, but we recommend using the extension opportunities first.\n\n## URL Structure\n\n```\n[scheme]:\/\/[host]\/[action]?[x-callback parameters]&[action parameters]\n```\n\n### scheme\n\nThe scheme should be a unique string identifier the target app. URL schemes are registered with iOS via an app’s Info.plist file. To support receiving x-callback-url message, an app must register a protocol with iOS. If your app uses x-callback-url, it is recommend you register a url scheme specifically for x-callback-url support, so that a source app can test for the registration of the scheme and ensure support is present.\n\n### host\n\nURLs will be identified by the use of “x-callback-url” as the host portion of the URL.\n\n### action\n\nThe remaining portion of the URL path after the version make up the name of the action to be executed in the target app. These actions will vary by app and should be documented by the developer of the app supporting x-callback-url.\n\n### x-callback Parameters\n\nx-callback-url defines several parameters with specific purposes, all of which are optional. These parameters should be passed as query args in the URL, in the format “key1=value1&key2=value2”. All values should be URL encoded strings.\n\n- **x-source :**- The friendly name of the source app calling the action. If the action in the target app requires user interface elements, it may be necessary to identify to the user the app requesting the action.\n- **x-success :**- If the action in the target method is intended to return a result to the source app, the x-callback parameter should be included and provide a URL to open to return to the source app. On completion of the action, the target app will open this URL, possibly with additional parameters tacked on to return a result to the source app. If x-success is not provided, it is assumed that the user will stay in the target app on successful completion of the action.\n- **x-error :**- URL to open if the requested action generates an error in the target app. This URL will be open with at least the parameters “errorCode=code&errorMessage=message”. If x-error is not present, and a error occurs, it is assumed the target app will report the failure to the user and remain in the target app.\n- **x-cancel :**- URL to open if the requested action is cancelled by the user. In the case where the target app offer the user the option to “cancel” the requested action, without a success or error result, this the the URL that should be opened to return the user to the source app.\n\n### Action Parameters\n\nIn addition to any of the optional parameters defined by x-callback-url, the query arguments can contain action parameters specific to target app’s supported actions. These parameters will be defined by the developer of the app supporting x-callback-url. The “x-” prefix should not be used on action parameters, but be reserved for additional parameters that may be defined by the x-callback-url specification.\n\n### Security Concerns\n\nBecause URL schemes open pathways to the data stored in your app, it is recommended that you carefully consider security when implementing URL schemes–whether they conform to the x-callback-url specification or not.\n\nHow to implement security is not covered by the specification, as the requirements vary greatly for different app, but, in general, URL schemes actions which perform destructive operations, post to services outside the app, or similar “dangerous” actions should require user-confirmation in-app to be sure the user has not unintentionally tapped on a malicious URL. Other mechanisms such as password keys, or similar may make sense for specific use cases.\n\n### Learn More\n\nTo learn more, check out the [Examples](http:\/\/x-callback-url.com\/examples) and [Implementation](http:\/\/x-callback-url.com\/implementation) pages.","views":43,"updated":"2022-10-22T11:23:50Z","tags":[],"type":null,"title":"","slug":"xspec","appearance":"norm","language":"en","rtl":false,"created":"2022-10-22T11:23:16Z","paid":false},{"id":"323syrsy9qq8en10","body":"# Vision\nBe Thou my Vision, O Lord of my heart;\nNaught be all else to me, save that Thou art\nThou my best Thought, by day or by night,\nWaking or sleeping, Thy presence my light.\n\nBe Thou my Wisdom, and Thou my true Word;\nI ever with Thee and Thou with me, Lord;\nThou my great Father, I Thy true son;\nThou in me dwelling, and I with Thee one.\n\nRiches I heed not, nor man's empty gain,\nThou mine Inheritance, now and always:\nThou and Thou only, first in my heart,\nHigh King of Heaven, my Treasure Thou art.\n\nHigh King of Heaven, my victory won,\nMay I reach Heaven's joys, O bright Heaven's Sun!\nHeart of my own heart, whatever befall,\nStill be my Vision, O Ruler of all.\n","views":36,"updated":"2022-10-24T20:42:34Z","tags":[],"type":null,"title":"","slug":"vision","appearance":"norm","language":"","rtl":false,"created":"2022-10-24T20:42:35Z","paid":false},{"id":"lxyt1csfbx8da3fn","body":"# Ulysses Help\nUpdated `10302022-234429`\n\n- [Gist](https:\/\/gist.github.com\/extratone\/3c3b6cbcd4c5d9893d14d9738a31af28)\n- [Drafts](drafts:\/\/open?uuid=CAABBB06-186C-437D-BC30-65844BDBEC2B)\n- [WTF](https:\/\/davidblue.wtf\/drafts\/CAABBB06-186C-437D-BC30-65844BDBEC2B.html)\n- [Local](shareddocuments:\/\/\/private\/var\/mobile\/Library\/Mobile%20Documents\/com~apple~CloudDocs\/Written\/5B48EE09-0120-4CBA-8097-0D1F029A603B.md)\n- [Ulysses](ulysses:\/\/x-callback-url\/open?id=YPt_Qing4G8YDUZwcn7mLQ)\n- [Simplenote Local](simplenote:\/\/note\/f648d08bccc443ab9c480c852b3d81fa)\n- [Simplenote Publish](http:\/\/simp.ly\/publish\/PGzWFh)\n- [Craft Publish](https:\/\/www.craft.do\/s\/PKrqdK8LBe4tYf)\n- [~](https:\/\/tilde.town\/~extratone\/manual\/ulysses\/)\n\n---\n\n<script src=\"https:\/\/gist.github.com\/extratone\/3c3b6cbcd4c5d9893d14d9738a31af28.js\"><\/script>\n\n---\n\n# Ulysses Help\n\n## Welcome\n\nNice to have you here! If you want to learn more about Ulysses’ philosophy and features, you’ve come to the right place. \n\nIf you have used the app on a Mac or iPhone before, you can probably skip this introduction and head straight to the Details and Tips section. This is Ulysses after all, you should get around easily.\n\nIf you’re entirely new to this, welcome aboard! Let’s cover some basic concepts to get you started.\n\n1. We believe that writing is about content, about what you want to say – not about fancy formatting. This is why writing in Ulysses means writing plain text, but at the same time more than plain text. We call it “plain text enhanced”. We will come back to this later.\n\n2. Ulysses is a single-library app, and all your texts live in this single library. There is no “Open”, no “Save” – it all happens right here, in this app only.\n\n3. Ulysses utilizes iCloud to store your texts, if you allow it to do so. This is especially nice if you also use Ulysses on your iPhone or on your Mac, in case you want to proceed writing on a larger screen. Your texts will sync automatically, as soon (or as long) as you’re connected to the web.\n\n4. Ulysses does not offer WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) styles and formats. Instead, your text will be formatted once you export it as a PDF, a web page, or an eBook.\n\nMost importantly, Ulysses is built to grow and adapt. You can use it as a sophisticated notepad, you can create the next Great American Novel. You can feed your blog, keep everything neatly organized, or mess around at will.\n\nThere is no “right” way to do things here, so make yourself comfortable, and make it your own.\n\n\n## Overview\n\nHere’s a general overview of Ulysses’ interface from left to right:\n\n- LIBRARY\n- SHEET LIST\n- EDITOR\n\nThe _library_ lets you access all your texts and is divided into sections. Depending on whether you’ve got iCloud enabled, you will see different sections here.\n\nThe _sheet list_ is where all your texts reside.\n\nAnd this here is the _editor_.\n\n## Basic Navigation\n\nTo switch between three pane (library, sheet list and editor), two pane (sheet list and editor) and editor only view, simply swipe from left to right on the editor, and back. To switch between sheets, you can use the sheet list.\n\nYou should try all of this now to get the hang of it. Just come back here, as we’re about to look at the cool stuff.\n\n## Back? Good!\n\nNow select the next sheet in the list. You’ll learn a bit about… sheets there.\n\n\n## Sheets\n\nAll writing is done on Ulysses’ sheets. Sheets are somewhat equivalent to classic documents, though they don’t require a “title” or a “file name” or such. Sheets can hold any amount of text.\n\nYou create sheets via the “New Sheet” button in the editor or the `+` button in the sheet list.\n\nYou can move sheets around and sort them at will: quite simply via drag and drop. When you touch and hold any given sheet, you can quickly mark it as favorite, or add keywords, duplicate it, delete it, you name it. \n\nYou can even select a couple of sheets, and then glue them together, merge them into one, or turn them into a PDF, for example. But to make _that_ look good, you’ll need some formatting, right?\n\nWell, read on…\n\n\n## Editor: Plain Text Enhanced\n\nBy now you should have noticed “all these funny characters” before headlines and within the text. You should also have noticed “these colored bubbles”, and wondered how they found their way into this otherwise format-free introduction.\n\nYou may even have marveled at how nice everything looks, how beautiful the text is set, how headlines are bold and lists indented, and how all this is possible without using fancy formatting palettes, rulers and font panels. And, ultimately, what it all means, what it’s good for, and _why you should care_.\n\n\nWe believe that writers should not be bothered with layout tasks. At the very least, layout tasks should never interfere with the writing process itself. Call it what you will – distraction-free, zen-like, purely semantic, mini minimal, neo retro –, fact is that content creation is best kept separate from presentation, or else the latter will get in the way. Eventually. By design (pun, sorry).\n\nUlysses uses so-called minimal markup to _define_, not format or style, text passages. From headlines to lists, to images and footnotes, you simply assign meaning with a couple of memorable characters.\n\n## Need a title? Create a title.\n\n> Need a quote?\n> Create a quote.\n\nOn a physical keyboard, these characters are easily accessible, and you can just type away. For the iPad’s virtual keyboard, we created a couple of shortcut buttons to make them easily accessible as well.\n\n\n\n## Ulysses’ Shortcut Buttons\n\nUlysses’ shortcut buttons sit directly above the iPad’s virtual keyboard, right next to the system’s text predictions. Let’s look at them one by one :\n\nThe arrows far left let you _move the cursor_ back and forth.\n\nThen there are shortcuts for _Undo_, _Redo_ and _Copy to Clipboard_. These are provided by the system and can look slightly different depending on the available space.\n\nOn the right-hand side of the text predictions (in case you have turned them on) are two buttons that hold _Ulysses’ markup_, sorted into somewhat logical groups: headings, lists and paragraph blocks, then inline formats like strong and emphasis plus links, footnotes and so on... it’s all there!\n\nIf there’s enough space, a `⌘` button will appear next, offering quick access to _special characters_. Most of these are available on sub-layers of the keyboard only, so we figured it could be nice to have them within reach.\n\nFinally, there’s the magnifying glass far right, which – you guessed it – opens _editor search_. It should work as expected (it’s just search, after all).\n\n\n## Dashboard\n\nSee the gauge icon in the editor? Tap it to open your “dashboard”.  It allows you to instantly check your text’s statistics and monitor your progress. You can also add keywords to better organize your library, and attach images or notes for further reference.\n\nTry this now: Tap the paperclip in the dashboard to open this sheet’s attachments. Save the note!\n\n### Navigation\n\nThe dashboard also offers an outline navigator which displays all your headlines in a hierarchical order. That way, you can not only quickly oversee your document’s structure, but also jump between its various parts. Even better, Ulysses does not stop at headlines – you can also navigate directly to embedded images, links, footnotes and even annotations and marked text passages.\n\n\n\n## Revision Mode\n\nUlysses is more than a writing tool — its dedicated revision mode aims to support you to improve your texts. Access revision mode via the editor menu (circled ellipsis).\n\n### Review\n\nIn addition to the general markup that you apply to headings and emphasized passages, Ulysses lets you use a number of tags for editing purposes, e.g., comment, marked and annotation.\n\n\nThe revision mode lists them all in the right sidebar. Tap an entry to jump to the respective spot in text. Tap in the text to start editing instantly. Try it out!\n\n### Grammar and Style Check\n\nGreat writing requires more than a compelling story; you’ll want your text to be articulate and free of mistyped words. Ulysses’ built-in advanced grammar and style check, which is available in over 20 languages, can help. In revision mode, select “Check Text” in the sidebar to receive informed suggestions in categories such as capitalization, punctuation, semantics, redundancy, typography and style. Tapping a suggestion will give you background information, the suggested change plus an ignore option.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Export: 360 Degree Semantics\n\nNow for the fun part: Ulysses can output your writing to a host of standard formats, such as Plain and Rich Text, HTML, ePub, PDF and DOCX. It does so by translating your _plain text input_ based on the definition of the minimal markup. If your brain starts to hurt, here’s a simple example…\n\nLet’s assume you want to emphasize a text passage. You select the word “emphasize” (do so), and mark it up as emphasis (tap the `A|` button and select Emphasis). Notice the extra characters that were entered around the word.\n\nYou have just told Ulysses, in its own “plain text language”, that this passage should be an emphasized passage. Now Ulysses knows and will never forget. So, when you export your text to, say, a PDF, Ulysses will translate this emphasized passage into what a PDF will understand and display – in this case, it will format your emphasized passage as italicized text.\n\nGive it a try:\n\n- Dismiss the keyboard (bottom right of keyboard)\n- Open the editor menu (circled ellipsis) and select Export.\n- In the view that just slid up, select PDF.\n- The “emphasize” above should be set in italics.\n\n## Headlines Such as This Will Get a Larger Font\n\nIf you export to HTML instead, Ulysses will translate the emphasized passage to semantically correct `<em>`, and the headline will be tagged with `<h2>`.\n\nAnd so on.\n\nThe beauty of this should be obvious by now: Instead of worrying about how your output _looks_, you can concentrate on what your content is _supposed to mean_. This may be frightening at first, but trust us, it’s not.\n\nIt’s awesome.\n\n### Share Your Work\n\nYou can send a PDF via email or save it to iCloud. You can open a DOCX file in Microsoft Word or Pages. You can publish your text as blog post to WordPress, Ghost, Micro.blog or Medium.\n\nIn the exporter, tap the Share icon to list all available options. They will differ depending on the chosen output and the apps installed on your iPad.\n\n\n## Export: Styles\n\nDepending on the format you choose during export, you can specify settings and switch between various export styles. Each style offers a predefined set of conversion rules.\n\nTake “Business”, a style available for both PDF and DOCX, as an example:\n\nHeading 1: Helvetica Neue, 45pt.\nBody text: Baskerville, 12pt.\nEmphasis: Italic.\nComments: Delete.\n\nAnd so on.\n\nUlysses features a couple of built-in styles for each exporter, and you can just switch between them on-the-fly. If you’re longing for a different look, try and visit our [Styles & Themes](https:\/\/styles.ulysses.app\/ \"Styles & Themes\") website, where you’ll find a great variety of styles created by the Ulysses community.\n\n\n## Export: Multiple Sheets\n\nBy now you should be fairly familiar with how to write stuff, edit things, and how to spam-mail your friends with your newest creations.\n\nBut remember, Ulysses aims to let you write whole books. And for these, you’ll probably need more than just a single sheet of content. So, how do you export multiple sheets at once, and as a single file to boot?\n\n### Sheet List: Select\n\nYou can switch the sheet list to a special view where you can select as many sheets as you want, and then perform different actions – one of them being export.\n\nUpon export, all selected sheets will be “stitched together”, as if they were just one large piece of content. And Ulysses is powerful enough to allow for really long content.\n\nYou should try this now with the introduction: Reveal the sheet list, open the sheet list menu (circled ellipsis) and choose “Select Sheets…”. Now, tap (aka select, see) as many sheets as you like, tap the More menu (circled ellipsis) and then select Export. Create an ePub, for example, and send it to Books.\n\nJust remember to eventually get back here and learn about groups, filters, and how to sync everything and anything between all of your devices.\n\n\n## Feed Your Blogs\n\nAre you a blogger? With Ulysses, you can publish your texts directly to various platforms, complete with images, links, tags and other metadata. \n\nFor example, Ulysses can interpret keywords as blog categories or tags; it will turn a note attachment into an excerpt; you can attach a photograph to a sheet to make it your blogpost’s featured image. Tiresome copy-pasting to your blogging platform’s CMS is a thing of the past.\n\nBefore publishing, you can, of course, review your metadata and make adjustments if needed. Published texts will receive a tiny paper plane in the sheet list as an indicator, and you can check their status in the dashboard.\n\nThe publishing feature works with [WordPress](https:\/\/wordpress.com), [Ghost](https:\/\/ghost.org), [Micro.blog](https:\/\/micro.blog) and [Medium](https:\/\/medium.com). To get started, all you’ve got to do is select Publishing as an export option, and connect your blogging accounts with Ulysses.\n\n## Groups & Filters\n\nIf you write a lot (and we bet you do), then you will need some means of organization. In Ulysses, groups and filters are your main tools to keep you organized. If you own a Mac, you’ll find that they’re very similar to Finder’s folders and smart folders.\n\nYou add groups and filters via the `+` menu in the library. You can place groups and filters inside other groups, and if you select a group, its contents will show up in the sheet list. Select a sheet, and it shows up in the editor – but you know that already.\n\nFilters are a special kind of group. Once set up, they will look at the group they’re in, and they will then list all sheets that match the set criteria. For example, you can set up a filter that only lists sheets with a certain keyword. If you place it deep within a nested group, say, six levels down, the filter will only show matching sheets within that very group.\n\nYou can also sort and move groups, or give them another title or a new icon. Just switch to the library, touch and hold a group, select Edit, and make your changes. It really _is_ that obvious. \n\n### Collapse & Expand\n\nIf your groups have a lot of sub-groups or even sub-sub-groups, things can get a little complex. For a less cluttered list, you can hide a groups’ sub-groups by tapping the arrow next to the group’s title. To show the sub-groups again, do the same.\n\n### Library Focus\n\nDo you want to focus on a specific project without concerning yourself with the other groups in your library? Just touch and hold any group, then select Focus, to have the library collapse down to focus on just that particular group.\n\n\n## iCloud and Ulysses on iPhone or Mac\n\nBy default, your texts, along with all your groups and filters, will get stored in iCloud. This is great, because you can seamlessly switch between iPad, iPhone and Mac, since Ulysses works on all of them. Just visit the App Store or the Mac App Store, install Ulysses on your devices, and you’re good to go: Outline a short story on the subway, and work out the details at home on your Mac. So cool.\n\nAs soon as you’re connected to the internet, sync will automatically start and keep your library up-to-date on all your devices. There’s nothing to do, no setup necessary, no button to press, nothing. Nothing.\n\n### iCloud vs. On My iPad\n\nOf course, you can also decide to store locally, or freely move your texts from the cloud to local storage only and vice versa.\n\n---- \n\nSo much for the moment. You should now know enough to get around – so start out, write something, settle in.\n\nHead back to the introduction for a primer on Markdown XL, how to make use of Ulysses’ advanced features, as well as tips, tricks and handy shortcuts.\n\n## A Super-Quick Markup Primer\n\nAs in “First Steps”, Ulysses uses special characters around text passages to let you define the meaning of these passages. This is called “markup”, and each character set, such as _underscores for emphasis_, is called a “markup definition”. Any collection of definitions is then called a “markup language”. There are many markup languages in the wild, and you may have come across one or the other on message boards or blogging platforms: Textile, Setext, or the increasingly popular Markdown by John Gruber.\n\nBy default, Ulysses uses its native markup language, dubbed “Markdown XL”.\n\n\n### Do You Speak Markdown XL?\n\nIf not, don’t worry – it is dead-easy to learn. Markdown XL consists of 25 definitions, and it will only take you little time to get the hang of it. All available definitions are accessible via Ulysses’ shortcut buttons atop the standard keyboard.\n\nThe definitions work in three different ways: They either mark up an entire paragraph (e.g., Heading, Comment Block), or they mark up a word or a phrase (e.g., Strong, Marked), or they add a so-called text object (e.g., Link, Footnote).\n\nLet’s have a quick run through all available definitions and their respective uses.\n\n\n### The Writing Phase\n\nTo mark up a _title_, start a line with one hash (`#`), for a _heading_,  with two hashes (`##`). For a _subheading_, type three or more hashes  – the number of hashes corresponds to the subheading’s hierarchical level. \n\nIf you want to _emphasize_ a word or phrase, or mark it up as **strong**, you can do so with single underscores, or double asterisks, respectively.\n\n_Dashed_ and _numbered lists_  can be created by simply typing dashes or numbers at the beginning of a line. And they will automatically continue, if “Smart Lists” are enabled (“Editor Settings › Substitutions”):\n\n- This is\n- An example\n- Of an unordered list\n\nIf you want to create _quotes_, e.g. to provide a motto, or to highlight famous quotes from even more famous people, simply start a line with a `>` character:\n\n> That’s one small step for a man, one giant leap for mankind.\n> (Neil Armstrong)\n\nAnd with a _divider_ you can, well, divide. Text sections, for example.\n\n---- \n\n### The Editing Phase\n\nThe following definitions are helpful for editing purposes: They let you mark text, as you would with a classic highlighter, or mark text for deletion. \n\n\nWhile these definitions serve important purposes on screen, their true power will only become apparent during export. As an example, when creating a PDF with the “Swiss Knife” style applied, comments and deletions will be absent from the output file, since this is a style meant to deliver a finalized PDF. But when using the “Rough Cut” style, comments will be included, since that style is meant to be used for printed drafts.\n\n\n### Text Objects\n\nHeadings, emphasis and comments may be all that’s needed for general prose, but some texts require images or footnotes, and online publications may require the insertion of links.\n\nEnter what we call text objects – “these colored bubbles” you have already come across in this introduction. They are a bit different from standard text markup, as you can tap a text object and add additional content (a photo, a URL). Their creation, however, is just as simple:\n\nTo [add a link](https:\/\/ulysses.app), type square brackets around a word or phrase. This will open a dedicated view which lets you add, well, a link to a webpage. If you type curly brackets around a phrase instead, you will create an annotation, which is basically a note added to that phrase. \n\nYou can also add images or footnotes, again by typing only a few characters. [^1] Enter `(img)` and you’ll be asked to provide either an image file or a URL. Of course, you can also just drag an image into your text, but where’s the fun in that?\n\n### Image Preview\n\nUlysses will, per default, display small image previews in the editor. You can tweak the size of this preview in the editor settings (accessible via the Editor menu) under “View Options”, or turn it off completely: Images will then be indicated by a little bubble dubbed `IMG`.\n\n\n### The Geek’s Corner\n\nFinally, there’s markup to either add `sample code` or raw source code. The former is indispensable for writing technical documentation, and the latter is really advanced stuff, with which you can add code that will be executed during export.\n\nYou can also insert whole paragraphs of both code variants. Here is a truly advanced Swift code example – released under GPL:\n\n```swift\nlet myString = \"You are beautiful.\"\nprint(\"Hello World. \" + myString)\n```\n\nNote: If you indicate a programming language, the syntax of your code will be highlighted in the editor and relevant export formats.\n\nAnd here is an example of a Raw Source block, which inserts a table when exported as HTML (and just vanishes when exported as PDF):\n\n<table border=\"1\">\n\t<tr><th>City<\/th><th>Country<\/th><th>River<\/th><\/tr>\n\t<tr><td>Hamburg<\/td><td>Hungary<\/td><td>Hérault<\/td><\/tr>\n\t<tr><td>Leipzig<\/td><td>Latvia<\/td><td>Llobregat<\/td><\/tr>\n<\/table>\n\n## Editor Settings\n\nLet’s start with some customization, shall we? Open the editor menu and select “Editor Settings” to open the settings overlay:\n\nThe first section lets you determine how your editor looks. You can choose from a variety of editor _Themes_.  _Appearance_ lets you determine if you want to work in dark mode, light mode, or match the system’s setting. Under _View Options_ you can toggle the display of the text counter as well as image previews – the latter can be set to anything between 3 and 8 lines. Also, you can (de-)activate syntax color coding and hide the shortcut bar from here.\n\nIn the next section, you find the editor _Typography_ settings: You can choose your editor font and modify text zoom, line length and height, as well as paragraph spacing and first line indent. _Substitutions_ lets you modify the settings for automatic list continuation, smart tags, auto-capitalization, auto-correction, and spell check. It’s also where the dedicated switch for TextExpander can be found. Under _Revision Mode_ you can turn Ulysses’ advanced text check on and off. \n\nThe next section lets you enable _Typewriter Mode_ and modify its various options, such as line highlight and fixed scrolling etc.\n\nFinally, you can switch the _Markup_ of the current sheet. But let’s get back to this later.\n\n### Typewriter Mode\n\nTypewriter Mode is aimed to help you direct your attention to _the very words you’re currently writing_. You can fine-tune its settings for the best results:\n\n-  _Fixed Scrolling_ (also known as typewriter scrolling) keeps the line you’re currently typing in vertically fixed on your screen.\n- _Mark Current Line_ highlights the line you’re currently typing in.\n- _Highlight_ fades out everything but the current line, sentence or paragraph, respectively.\n\nYou can enable Typewriter Mode in the editor settings (accessible via the editor menu).\n\n### Smart Tags\n\nIf enabled, every time you type in a start tag and continue typing, an end tag placeholder will automatically be inserted. So, you don’t need to type the end tag, see? To accept the end tag, just tap Return on the keyboard.\n\n### Smart Lists\n\nIf enabled, every time you start a list, tapping Return will automatically add another list item. So you don’t have to keep typing these dashes or numbers. Hit the Return key at the end of a list to, well, end the list.\n\n- You can try it right here. Place the cursor somewhere inside this list item (or at its end) and hit Return.\n\nYou can disable smart tags and lists in the editor settings under Substitutions.\n\n\n# Sheet List Settings\n \nIn the sheet list menu – the circled ellipsis icon in the sheet list – you find a couple of options for customization. Tap _Sort By_ to determine if you want to see your sheets ordered manually, by date or by title. _Preview_ allows you to personalize your sheet list, i.e. set the amount of lines shown in the sheet preview, and set if you want modification\/creation dates shown or not.\n\n## General Settings\n\nThe general settings are located in the library (gear icon).\n\nHere, you can edit your groups and filters, define the sections you want to display in the library, and access your backups.\n\nAlso, head there to consult our FAQ and contact support, protect access to Ulysses with a password, and check the status of your subscription.\n\n\n### Privacy Protection\n\nWriting can be a rather personal affair. If you want to protect your texts from the eyes of your co-workers (or your mom) while you’re away, you can have Ulysses lock itself after a set period of time and require a password to get back to work. If your iPad supports Touch ID, you can even enable – wait for it – Ulysses at your fingertips. Ha.\n\nYou can set password lock via the general settings – you’ll find them top right in the library.\n\n## Split View\n\nDo you want to display two texts next to each other? Write a paper while chatting with your friends? Research Wikipedia while writing an essay? As Ulysses supports the system’s multitasking features, you can! \n\nSplit View allows you to open Ulysses next to Safari, Ulysses next to Ulysses or a Ulysses sheet next to its export preview.\n\nTo set up for Split View, keep Ulysses open, and slide upwards from the bottom of the screen to show the dock. Touch and hold the Ulysses icon or that of another app, and drag it to the left or right edge of the screen. You can also drag a sheet from the sheet list to left or right to invoke Split View.\n\nOnce in Split View, you can drag the divider to change the proportions of both app windows. To scroll through both windows at a time, use two fingers – one for each – and move them simultaneously.\n\nExtra: If you want to open the export preview in Split View, use the Multitasking button (`...`) at the top of the export preview window. \n\n## Drag and Drop\n\nUlysses supports drag and drop, both inside the app, and in conjunction with other apps: You can rearrange sheets by simply picking them up and moving them around. And you can just drop images from Safari (or wherever) into the editor, and drag text passages from here to there, for example.\n\n\n## Export\n\nTo export the current editor, simply open the editor menu and tap Export. To export multiple sheets at once, switch to the sheet list, open the sheet list menu, tap “Select Sheets…”, and select the sheets you want. You can also export an entire group: Switch to the library, touch and hold a group, then select Export.\n\nIn the header bar of the export preview, you can then select the output format you desire. \n\n### HTML Export\n- Tap the brush to choose an export style to be applied during export.\n- Also, choose between Snippet and Full Page output:\n\t- “Snippet” will just convert all tags to HTML and then export the text.\n\t- “Full Page” will create a complete HTML document, including header, body, CSS links and so on.\n- Tap Share for further processing.\n\n### ePub Export\n- Tap the sliders icon to choose an export style to be applied during export.\n- You can also set title and author metadata.\n- You can add an image to be used as cover image for your ebook.\n - Tap Share for further processing.\n\n### PDF Export\n- Tap the brush to choose an export style to be applied during export.\n- You can also choose a paper format.\n- Tap Share for further processing.\n\n### DOCX Export\n- Tap the brush to choose an export style to be applied during export.\n- You can also choose a paper format.\n- Tap Share for further processing.\n\n### Plain Text Export\n- “Plain Text” will strip out all tags, comments, annotations, images etc., and only export the text itself.\n- Tap Share for further processing.\n\n### Rich Text Export\n- “Rich Text” will produce a simple RTF file.\n- Tap Share for further processing.\n\n### Markdown Export\n- “Markdown” will keep (or convert) all tags and export the text in Markdown syntax.\n- Tap Share for further processing.\n\n### TextPack Export\n- [“TextPack”](http:\/\/textbundle.org \"TextBundle.org\") is a file format which supports sending plain text including images to other apps.\n - Tap Share for further processing.\n\n### Publishing\n- Choose “Add Account” and select a publishing platform.\n- WordPress: Provide your username and password, and, for a self-hosted WordPress installation (“Custom WordPress”), the URL. \n- Ghost: Provide your username, password and URL.\n- Medium: You’ll need to [provide an integration token for activation](https:\/\/help.medium.com\/hc\/en-us\/requests\/new?ticket_form_id=360000821214).\n- Micro.blog: You’ll need to provide an app token — when logged in to your account, you can [create it here](https:\/\/micro.blog\/account\/apps).\n- Depending on the chosen blogging platform, you can revise a post’s settings (tags, schedule, publishing status and so on) before publishing it.\n- WordPress, Ghost and Micro.blog: You can also update previously published posts from within Ulysses.\n\nTip: Do you work in Dark Mode and want to prevent the export preview from blinding you with its brightness? Make sure to select Reading Mode for the export preview. 😎\n\n## Tracking Progress\n\nWould you like to know how much you’ve written so far? Open the dashboard’s Progress view; here you can set writing goals and check your text statistics.\n\n### Writing Goals & Deadlines\n\nWriting goals allow you to track your progress in relation to a certain word or character limit. You can even target a specific reading time and assign a deadline. For example, this sheet’s goal is set to “at most 1,620 characters”. \n\nThe status of a goal is indicated by an icon in the top right corner of a sheet, as well as next to a sheet’s preview in the sheet list. Try the following: Tap to toggle the keyboard. Now type some words. Do you see the goal icon turn red because you’ve overreached?\n\n### Text Statistics\n\nFurther down you find detailed text statistics, such as the number of characters, words and pages, even average reading time.\n\nStatistics are also available for groups and filters. In the library, touch and hold a group to open its context menu, then select Edit. In the Progress section you can check the group’s combined statistics.\n\nYou can also check statistics for one or more sheets via the sheet list. Open the sheet list menu, tap “Select Sheets…” and mark the sheets in question. Tap on “X Selected” at the top of the sheet list to display combined statistics.\n\n### Daily Goals & Session History\n\nGoals are also available for entire groups, via Edit in their context menu.\n\nGroup goals let you review your writing session history, as they display daily statistics based on the activity in that group. They also can help build a writing habit: Set a goal’s type to “Every day”, and it will be reset every morning.\n\n## Search – and Find\n\nSo many texts, so many words? In case you lose track, you can use Quick Open to search for a sheet or a group in your entire library. Try this:\n\n- Tap the circled search icon top left in the editor.\n- Enter a search term to scan your library, e.g. “Quick”.\n- Tap to get back here.\n\nYou can also limit your search to a certain section of your library.\n\n## Search & Replace\n\nEditor search is also available. It allows you to search for (and even replace) text within the currently opened sheet: Just tap the search icon in the shortcut bar above your keyboard. Tap the gear icon to switch between search modes.\n\n\n## Keywords\n\nKeywords may help you organize your writing according to your needs: label a text as _Urgent_, mark a blog post as _Draft_ or _Published_, you name it. You can add keywords via the dashboard or a sheet’s context menu, i.e. when you touch and hold the sheet in the sheet list.\n\nThere’s a global keyword manager to let you rename, delete and merge the keywords in use, or change their colors. You can even mark your most-used keywords as favorites, and enjoy quick access to them throughout the app.\n\nYou may also create a filter and set a keyword match as condition. As an example, create a filter **Stuff that needs to be done** for sheets dubbed _Urgent_.\n\n## Favorites\n\nYou can mark frequently used sheets as favorites. They will appear in the respective group in the topmost section of the library. This is especially useful if you find yourself switching a lot between different groups or filters. Just go to the sheet list, touch and hold a sheet, and select Favorite from its context menu.\n\n\n## Share Extension\n\nWhen browsing the web, you may find information you would like to use as a starting point for your writing in Ulysses. You can use Safari’s share button to send the URL of a web page directly to Ulysses’ inbox or any other group. You can also add additional text right inside the share sheet.\n\nTo make this work, you’ll first need to activate Ulysses in the list of available apps when you share with it for the first time, though. iOS, security…\n\nSharing also works with other apps and content types, such as photos and text snippets, as long as the respective app offers a share button.\n\n\n\n## Editing Groups and Filters\n\nTo change the title or icon of a group, switch to the library, open the library menu, and tap “Edit Library…”. Then select the group or filter and… change its title or icon. We have included a ton of different icons to choose from, so take your time, choose wisely.\n\nThis is also the place to set a group-specific sorting for your sheets – per default, it is set to “manually”, but you can also sort by title or creation\/modification date.\n\nYou can also add a group- or filter-specific writing goal, i.e. a certain word or character count you aim to achieve.\n\nIf you’re editing a filter, you can change its criteria in the same view. Try setting up a filter that looks for “filter” and call it “Meta”.\n\n\n## External Folders\n\nIn Ulysses, all your texts live in a library, and the only way to access your texts is via this very library. However, you can also point Ulysses to folders that live outside of the standard library, e.g. on Dropbox or iCloud Drive, and have their contents behave just like native groups and sheets. \n\nTo do so, switch to the library, tap the `+` icon, and select “From Dropbox…” or “From Files…”. You can then specify how Ulysses should handle your files. With your sheets saved as Ulysses files, you have the app’s full functionality at your disposal. If you prefer to use Markdown files, e.g., to ensure compatibility with other apps, you can do so as well.\n\nYou can add as many external folders as you want.\n\n## External Files\n\nIf you need to edit text files stored on other cloud services (such as iCloud Drive, Box.com or OneDrive), you can. Open the files in Ulysses, e.g., from the Files app. They will appear in a special library section called “External Files”, where you can edit them _in place_ — changes made to these files will get saved back immediately, and the files can still be accessed from other apps.\n\nOnce “External Files” are enabled, you can open single documents by opening the sheet list menu and selecting “Open File”. \n\nPlease note that both opening external files and embedding external folders are system features, which each cloud service needs to explicitly support. If you can’t access files or folders stored with a certain provider here, it is because that particular provider does not yet support these features on iOS.\n\n## Import Files\n\nOf course, you can also import text documents into Ulysses for further editing. Importing will copy the document into the library, keeping the original file untouched. This even works with DOCX files.\n\nTo import a document into Ulysses, go to the library and touch and hold the group you wish to import into. Select Import, and browse the folders of supported storage providers. Another option is to make use of the Share command available in third-party apps — e.g. when you receive a text file via email. Once “opened” in Ulysses, the file will also be available in your inbox.\n\n\n## Hardware Support\n\nYou can, _of course_, use a mouse, trackpad, or external keyboard with Ulysses on iPad.\n\n### Keyboard Shortcuts\n\nUlysses not only supports typing on an external keyboard (why wouldn’t it) – it even offers advanced functionality through keyboard shortcuts (again, why wouldn’t it).\n\nOn your hardware keyboard, hold `⌘` at any time to display a list of available shortcuts.\n\nHere’s a list of functional shortcuts for when a hardware keyboard is attached. If you’re familiar with Ulysses for Mac, you should feel right at home.\n\n- `⌘1` to toggle the library\n- `⌘2` to toggle the sheet list\n- `⌘3` to toggle the editor\n- `⌘4` to toggle the dashboard\n- `⌘6` to toggle the export preview\n- `⌘7` to toggle the dashboard’s Progress view\n- `⌘8` to toggle the outline navigator\n\n- `^⌘1` to `^⌘4` to switch between the dashboard’s various views\n- `⌘O` to look for a sheet in the whole library (Quick Open)\n- `↓` and `↑` to navigate results\n- `↩︎` to open a selected result\n- `⌘↩︎` to reveal a result in its parent group\n- `esc` or `⌘O` to close Quick Open\n\n- `⌘F` to open editor search (Find)\n- `⌘G` to step to the next search match\n- `⇧⌘G` to step to the previous search match\n- `esc` or `⌘F` to close search\n\n- `⌘⌥↓` to move to the next sheet\n- `⌘⌥↑` to move to the previous sheet\n\n- `⌘⌥→` and `⌘⌥←` to switch between views\n- `↩︎` to switch from library to sheet list\n- `↩︎` or `⌘↩︎` to select a sheet and begin editing\n- in the library\/sheet list: `↓` and `↑` to navigate between groups and sheets\n- in the exporter: `Space`, `⇧Space`,`↓` and `↑` to navigate\n\n- `⌘N` to create a new sheet\n- `^⌥⌘N` to create a new material sheet\n- `^⌘M`to use a sheet as material\/regular sheet:\n- `⌘↩︎` to begin\/end editing\n- `⇧⌘N` to create a new group\n- `^⌘N` to create a new filter\n- `⌘D` to duplicate a sheet or group\n- `⌃⌘U` to mark\/unmark a sheet as favorite\n- `⇧⌘U` to go to the favorites group\n\n- `⇧⌘K` to edit keywords\n- `⌘Z` for Undo\n- `⇧⌘Z` for Redo\n\n- `⌘⧵` or `⌘#` to increase heading levels\n- `⇧⌘⧵` or `⇧⌘#` to decrease heading levels\n- `⌘K` to create a [link](#)\n- `⌘I` for _emphasis_\n- `⌘B` for **strong**\n- `⌘L` to clear all markup\n- `⇥` to indent\n- `⇧⇥` to outdent\n- `⇧⌘B` to split a sheet at the current cursor location\n\n- `⇧⌘C` to open the smart copy options menu\n- `⌥⌘C` to copy selected text with last used smart copy option\n- `⇧⌘V` to open the smart paste options menu\n- `⌥⌘V` to paste text with last used smart paste option\n\n- `⌥⌘6` to open the export preview in the second editor\n\n- `⌃⌘F` to toggle Full-Screen Mode\n- `⌥⌘T` to toggle Typewriter Mode\n\n- `⌘+` to increase font size\n- `⌘-` to decrease font size\n- `⌘0` to reset font size to default value\n\nInstead of `esc`, the shortcut `⌘.` can always be used.\n\n\n## Themes\n\nThemes define the colors of your editor. These include background, text and markup colors, as well as the colors of the various text objects. Themes also define the size of your headings in the editor. Ulysses ships with a couple of built-in themes, each of which features a dedicated light and dark variant.\n\nIf you want more choice, you should visit our [Styles & Themes](https:\/\/styles.ulysses.app \"Styles & Themes\") website, where you can find and download a whole range of themes, all created by fellow Ulysses users.\n\n### Creating Your Own Themes\n\nIf you own Ulysses for Mac, you can create your own themes or modify existing ones. They will automatically sync across all of your devices. Hurrah!\n\n\n## Escape Character\n\nIf you need to type a lot of square brackets (because you’re that kind of person [the one, you know…]), you might wonder how to keep Ulysses from automatically treating phrases in square brackets as links. Same for any other character you might \\*really\\* want to type.\n\nWell, to keep Ulysses from treating just about _any_ character as markup, simply add a backslash in front of it. So if you really want a square bracket instead of a link, type it like this: [like this].\n\n### Markup\n\nYou may also wonder, how and where these characters are defined, e.g. why **this** means strong and not something else. Or maybe you’re already familiar with a different markup language (Textile, for example), and would rather use that.\n\nBy default, Ulysses uses its native markup language, dubbed “Markdown XL”. It’s an extension of John Gruber’s Markdown and allows for annotations and footnotes and whatnot. It forms the basis of Ulysses’ advanced text editing capabilities.\n\nHowever, Ulysses comes with three other variants built-in – “Markdown“, “Textile’d” and “Minimark” –, which offer somewhat different tags and features. You can convert any sheet into a different markup via the editor settings (accessible via the editor menu).\n\nIf you own Ulysses for Mac, you can even create your own markup. And as with themes, markups created on Mac will automatically sync across all your devices.\n\n\n## Siri Shortcuts\n\nDo you find yourself heading to the same group over and again? Or constantly adding content to a specific sheet? If the answer is yes and you think it's a bit tiresome, you may let Siri do the work for you. \n\nUlysses allows you to assign Siri Shortcuts to a number of actions. Just touch and hold a particular group or sheet and select Share. Now choose one of the following actions, respectively:\n- “View Group from Siri” to open this very group,\n- “New Sheet from Siri” to create a new sheet in this group,\n- “View Sheet from Siri” to open this very sheet.\n\nNow you’ll be able to add a voice command and have Siri execute this very action whenever you say so.\n\n## Backup & Restore\n\nIf everything goes as planned, you should not have to care about this. If – for whatever reason – it does not go as planned, and if you believe you’ve lost content, keep your cool: Your entire library gets backed up on a regular basis.\n\nYou can access these backups in the library (where else): Just open the general settings (the gear icon in the library) and select “Backup…” (see what we did there?). To restore a single sheet or a group, touch and hold it and select “Restore to iCloud\/On My iPad\/Inbox”.\n\n## We Support…\n\nShould you have a question not covered by this introduction, please don’t hesitate to contact us at [help@ulysses.app](mailto:help@ulysses.app).

It supports hardware keyboard, code completion driven by your server’s kernel and has a beautiful touch friendly interface, that feels much more natural than trying to access Jupyter through your iPad’s Safari browser. Actually, some reviews suggest it’s easier to work with Jupyter in **Juno Connect** rather than on desktop! 😉\n\n# Jupyter\n\nI did cover Jupyter in my posts already, it’s an [interactive cloud computing environment](https:\/\/jupyter.org), where you can combine code execution, Markdown, LaTeX, plots and rich media. It supports over 40 programming languages (including Python, R, Julia and Scala) and most big data and machine learning tools.\n\nNow, the most beautiful part is that code execution is separated from the development environment, which means that whenever you hit “Run” the hardware that actually executes your code and delivers the output can be anywhere where it can be reachable with a networking interface. Essentially, this means that with Juno Connect you can use your iPad to run code on a superpower computing cluster somewhere on another continent, and still receive output and feedback (including code completion suggestions!) in realtime. How awesome is that?\n\n![image-center](https:\/\/navoshta.com\/images\/posts\/juno\/screenshot_h_01@2x.png)\n\nI did realise, however, that Jupyter may not be the most user-friendly tool to work with, so I tried to make sure that Juno Connect provides the easiest entry point to using Jupyter with two things: backend integrations and bundled introductory notebooks.\n\n# Backends\n\nJupyter can sometimes be tricky to setup for remote access. There are plenty of tutorials out there (including [mine](https:\/\/juno.sh\/ssl-self-signed-cert\/) about configuring SSL), but some of them require additional knowledge of networking, command line interfaces and Unix systems. Luckily, there are cloud computing services that eliminate this by providing you a remote Jupyter Notebook environment out of the box, such as [Azure Notebooks](https:\/\/notebooks.azure.com) and [CoCalc](https:\/\/cocalc.com\/). Both have free tiers, although CoCalc also offers paid plans with less restricted access and better hardware.\n\nWhat you get is a virtual server running Jupyter Notebook that you can access from anywhere in browser — or in Juno Connect as well! You can simply log in with your Microsoft or CoCalc account and access all your projects\/libraries, and work with all your notebooks using Juno’s interface. It’s easier to think of it as a special preconfigured server that simply provides a computational backend for Juno Connect.\n\n![image-center](https:\/\/navoshta.com\/images\/posts\/juno\/screenshot_h_02@2x.png)\n\n# Bundled Notebooks\n\nEven setting up an account with cloud computing service and trying to understand how Jupyter works can be a significant time investment for users not familiar with it. That’s why I have included a set of introductory notebooks that are available and runnable as soon as you download the app. They have plenty of sample code snippets and generated output (including stunning retina graphics), showing some of the amazing things you can do with Jupyter. Those notebooks are launched on temporary servers individually for each user, so any changes you make in these introductory notebooks will only appear for you, and will only persist until your server is restarted due to inactivity.\n\nUnder the hood Juno Connect uses [Binder](https:\/\/mybinder.org) to launch these notebooks, Binder is a service that turns any GitHub repo into a collection of interactive notebooks by launching a temporary server for it. It works amazingly well, and I am planning to introduce a better integration with it in Juno Connect, essentially allowing users to launch any GitHub repo as a server right in the app.\n\n![image-center](https:\/\/navoshta.com\/images\/posts\/juno\/screenshot_h_06@2x.png)\n\n# Interface\n\nI have spent quite some time trying to make the user interface touch- and iPad-friendly. I believe users have certain expectations in terms of UI when working with an iPad app, and writing code is something that hasn’t been tackled too often in other apps up until this point. So this has been quite a challenge, but I’m pretty happy with how it turned out eventually. It did take a couple of iterations (and a lot of feedback), but at least when it comes to notebook editing, the experience is much better now! What in my opinion makes Juno’s interface stand out is how it managed to declutter navigation panel using context actions and menus.\n\n\n\r\n\n       [![image](https:\/\/navoshta.com\/images\/posts\/juno\/screenshot_v_01.png)] (\/\/navoshta.com\/images\/posts\/juno\/screenshot_v_01.png)\r\n\n       [![image](https:\/\/navoshta.com\/images\/posts\/juno\/screenshot_v_02.png)] (\/\/navoshta.com\/images\/posts\/juno\/screenshot_v_02.png)\r\n\n       [![image](https:\/\/navoshta.com\/images\/posts\/juno\/screenshot_v_05.png)] (\/\/navoshta.com\/images\/posts\/juno\/screenshot_v_05.png)\r\n\n       [![image](https:\/\/navoshta.com\/images\/posts\/juno\/screenshot_v_06.png)] (\/\/navoshta.com\/images\/posts\/juno\/screenshot_v_06.png)\r\n\n       [![image](https:\/\/navoshta.com\/images\/posts\/juno\/screenshot_v_08.png)] (\/\/navoshta.com\/images\/posts\/juno\/screenshot_v_08.png)\r\n\n       [![image](https:\/\/navoshta.com\/images\/posts\/juno\/screenshot_v_09.png)] (\/\/navoshta.com\/images\/posts\/juno\/screenshot_v_09.png)\r\n\n\n\r\n\nI would like to take this opportunity to thank all beta testers (more than 1200 of them!) who helped testing it and shared their feedback. Thank you once again, and I hope you will enjoy all the new things planned for **Juno Connect** in the coming year!

Ferrite makes it quick and easy to collect together interviews, narration, music and other audio, and then later put them together into a project or package.\n\n1.  \nRecording\n\n2.  \nThe Library\n\n3.  \nAudio Info and Preproduction\n\n4.  \nProject Info\n\n5.  \nOverview\n\n6.  \nTracks\n\n7.  \nBasic Edits\n\n8.  \nAdvanced Edits\n\n9.  \nEditing Menu\n\n10.  \nEffects\n\n11.  \nAutomation\n\n12.  \nMP3 Chapters\n\n13.  \nCompression and Sharing\n\n14.  \nLong Recordings\n\n15.  \nTransferring Audio to a Computer\n\n16.  \nViewing History\n\n17.  \nArchives\n\n18.  \nTemplates\n\n19.  \nPresets\n\n20.  \nTagging\n\n21.  \nDrag And Drop\n\n22.  \nAccessibility: VoiceOver\n\n23.  \nShortcuts, Gestures and Keyboard Commands\n\n24.  \nSettings\n\n25.  \nBluetooth\n\n26.  \nAudio Unit Extensions\n\n27.  \nWhat’s New in Ferrite 2\n\r\n\n## Recording\n\nWhen you open up Ferrite, the top of the screen is taken up with the recording controls.\n\n\n\n\n**Note:** Due to iOS privacy protections, you need to give Ferrite permission to access to your microphone before you can use the recording controls.\n\n\n\r\n\nOnce you’ve taken care of that, you’ll see:\n\n*   A large microphone button, to start or stop recording\n*   A description of the device that will be used for recording (e.g. iPad Microphone)\n*   A display, wrapped around the microphone button, that shows the loudness of the sound currently being picked up by the microphone.\r\n\nIf you have headphones plugged in, you’ll also see a small \n\nHeadphones\n\n button. Tap this to turn “monitoring” on or off. When monitoring is on, everything that’s picked up by the microphone will be sent to the headphones so you can listen to it.\n\n\n\n\n**Note:** This is unavailable when using the device’s built-in speaker, because the sound would be picked up again by the mic, causing a feedback loop and a nasty squealing sound.\n\n\n\r\n\nThe recording panel is slightly different depending on the version of iOS you are using — if you are using iOS 13 or later, more features are available, along with a more modern design.\n\n### In iOS 13 or later:\n\nIf you’re using a single mono microphone, you will see a “rainbow” over the microphone button that represents the sound it is picking up. If you have a stereo source connected, or an interface that supports multiple channels, the display is broken down into sections, one for each channel. The free version is limited to 1 or 2 channels (mono\/stereo), but the Pro version supports more — see the \nPro recording features section\n for details.\n\nChannel input displays are 0&nbsp;dB peak meters, meaning that if the meter fills up, you’ve maxxed out the input, causing clipping. The entire section will light up red if this happens, and glow for a few seconds afterwards. You ideally want the loudest sounds to light up everything except the outer ring, to get the highest quality recording.\n\nA common technique is to try and get typical voice levels to be in the bright green region (if you have “differentiate without colour” enabled in the iOS settings, this region is solid, while the ones around it are dotted) as this gives a nice, loud, clear recording, while still having a bit of “headroom” so that sounds that are a little louder don’t clip.\n\n### In iOS 12 or earlier:\n\nIf you’re using a single mono microphone, you will see rings around the microphone button to represent the sound it is picking up. If you have two microphones connected (or another stereo source) these will split into two “fans”, representing the left and right input levels.\n\nThese are 0&nbsp;dB peak meters, meaning that if the meter fills up, you’ve maxxed out the input, causing clipping. The outer ring will light up red if this happens, and glow for a few seconds afterwards. You ideally want the loudest sounds to light up everything except the outer ring, to get the highest quality recording.\n\nWhen you tap to start a recording, a timer will appear, showing how long you’ve been recording for. If you tap the recording button again, recording will stop. Ferrite will store your recording in the \nThe Library\n, and reset, ready for the next recording.\n\n\n\n\n**Tip:** You can change this behaviour in the \nSettings\n if you prefer, so tapping the recording button will pause recording, and another tap will resume it again, as many times as you like. In this mode, a “checkmark” (iOS 12) or “Save” (iOS 13) button appears whenever your recording is paused. Tap it when you want to finish and save your recording.\n\n\n\r\n\n\n\n**Note:** Whichever recording mode you choose, your recording is always being saved continuously to your device’s permanent storage. So if, for example, your device runs out of batteries and shuts off during a recording, everything up to that point will still have been saved. When you recharge, restart the device, and open Ferrite back up again, it will find the recording and ask if you want to finish processing it.\n\n\n\r\n\n    When you finish a recording, it will appear at the top of the Library (by default, it’s sorted by time and date, with the most recent items at the top). You can give it a useful name by tapping the \nInfo\n button.\n\nDuring recordings, a “bookmark” button also appears. When you tap this, Ferrite makes a note of the time in the recording, and you can list and jump back to these bookmarks later, while listening to or editing the recording. You might use this to mark moments where you need to go back and make changes — perhaps to edit out a mistake or some background noise that interrupted the recording — or you might use it to remember where the highlights are.\n\nA bookmark is also added automatically each time you pause and resume recording, so you can quickly find those points for editing.\n\n### Ferrite&nbsp;2&nbsp;Pro recording features\n\n*   Additional recording features are only available to customers who have purchased the Ferrite 2 Pro upgrade and using iOS 13 or later\r\n\nFerrite can record up to 8 channels, if you are using the Pro version. Podcasts, radio, audiobooks etc are typically mono or stereo (1 or 2 channels) only, so the additional channels won’t be played back unless you select or split them in the \nAudio Info Channel Selection controls\n.\n\nIf you have an audio interface with lots of inputs, but you’ve only connected mics to some of them, you can switch off the channels you’re not using. This saves space in the recording file, but the feature isn’t enabled by default (to avoid accidentally switching off a channel you wanted to record). You can enable it in the Recording \nSettings\n.\n\nOnce enabled, double-tap on a channel to toggle it on or off. You can change this as much as you like before you start recording, or after you stop, but not during a recording.\n\n\n\n\n**Note:** Some file formats can only store 1-2 channels. If you have more inputs connected than your chosen file format supports, the additional channels will be marked unavailable with a “warning triangle”. Tap the triangle for more info.\n\n\n\r\n\nDepending on how many inputs your audio interface has, it might be tedious to turn them on or off one-by-one. If you hold down on a channel, a menu pops up where you can switch all the channels on\/off. Ferrite can also auto-detect channels: it will switch them on\/off depending on which ones have sound coming through them. This normally matches the channels that have microphones connected, but depending on your interface, you may need to ensure the input gain is all the way down for unused channels.\n\nWhen using headphones to monitor multiple channels at once, Ferrite spreads them across the stereo field. If you’re making a stereo recording, this matches your recording, but if you’re recording two or more people with one mic each, it can sometimes be distracting. Ferrite&nbsp;2&nbsp;Pro users can adjust this, either reducing the stereo spread (making it sound more like the people are standing in front of you, and slightly to the sides, instead of talking directly into your left\/right ears) or mixing them down to mono. The monitoring settings don’t affect the stereo mix of the recording itself, just what you hear while monitoring. You can change the stereo spread in the \nSettings\n, or by holding down the headphones button until the menu appears.\n\n## The Library\n\nThe Library is where all your recordings and projects are kept. You can also add other audio to your Library, by tapping the \n\nTools\n\n button in the top-right of the screen. Pick “Import Audio” from the tools menu to browse your device‘s Music Library — or other sources — for audio files to add to your collection.\n\nEverything in the Library is either an Audio file, a Project, a Template, or an Archive.\n\n\n\nAudio file\n\r\n\n\n\nA recording made in Ferrite, or recordings, music or other audio imported from elsewhere.\n\n\n\r\n\nProject\n\r\n\n\n\nA document you create by combining one or more Audio files, arranging them and applying changes to them to make a finished product or package (e.g. a radio programme, podcast, audiobook, or whatever else you have in mind).\n\n\n\r\n\nTemplate\n\r\n\n\n\nAllows you to quickly create new Projects that are already set up, ready to start work on a new episode of a show.\n\n\n\r\n\nArchive\n\r\n\n\n\nA way to “tidy up” after finishing a project, by moving the project and all its audio into a single file. They’re described in detail in the \nArchives\n chapter — you probably don’t need to worry about them for now.\n\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\n\n**Note:** Projects do not **contain** any audio — that’s all still preserved in the original recordings, so you can change your mind, compare your edited versions to the originals, or even re-use the same audio in multiple projects without wasting space on your device. This means If you delete a recording used by a project, the recording will be **removed from the project**.\n\n\n\r\n\nYou can preview any item in your Library by tapping the \n\nPlay\n\n button to its left. While previewing audio, a bar appears, with a marker showing your position within the file. Tap the bar or drag the marker to jump to a different time. While listening to the audio, you can tap the Play button again to pause the preview, or hold the Play button down to stop and close the preview. Or, it will close itself, if you preview a different item.\n\nYou can tap any item in your Library to show more commands for that item:\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit\n\n\n\r\n\n\n\nOpens the project editor to edit the item.\n\n*   If the item is a project, it will be opened for editing.\n*   If the item is a piece of audio, a new project will be created. The audio is added to it, then the new project is opened for editing. When you return to the Library you’ll see the new project has appeared at the top.\r\n\n\r\n\n\n\nInfo\n\n\n\r\n\n\n\nOpens a panel of information about the item, some of which you can edit (for example, to rename the item). See \nAudio Info and Preproduction\n and \nProject Info\n.\n\n\n\r\n\n\n\nShare\n\n\n\r\n\n\n\nAllows you to export the item, sending it to a person (e.g. by email), or social network, or to another app or file storage service (e.g. iCloud or Dropbox). You can also duplicate projects from here, and other tasks.\n\n\n\r\n\n\n\nDelete\n\n\n\r\n\n\n\nPermanently removes the item from your device.\n\n\n\n\n**Warning:** You cannot recover an item once you have deleted it! Projects are gone forever, and if the item was a piece of audio, any projects that made use of it will now simply have silence where that audio used to be.\n\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n### Selecting More Than One Item At Once\n\nYou can select several projects or audio files to be deleted or shared in a single action. You can also select several audio files to be gathered together and edited in a single new project.\n\n    Tap the \n\nSelect\n\n button in the top-left of the Library. You can now tap items in the Library to select or deselect them. You can then tap the \n\nEdit\n\n, \n\nShare\n\n or \n\nDelete\n\n buttons that appear in the toolbar, to apply the command to each selected item.\n\n\n\n\n**Note:** When sharing, Ferrite will make all the files you select available to the sharing services, but many sharing services only support a single file at a time. The exact list of sharing services available depends on the other apps you have installed on your device. You may need to tap the \n\nMore…\n\n button in the sharing panel to enable the sharing services you want.\n\n\n\r\n\n### Filtering the Library\n\nOver time, the Library may fill up with lots of audio and projects. You can keep things manageable and find items quickly by filtering. There are three ways to filter: By type, by tag, or by typing some text into the search box. You can combine these, to quickly pick out exactly the items you want.\n\nAt the very top of the screen, you can tap the \n\nLibrary\n\n title to pop up options for filtering by type. This will hide some of the items in your list. The filtering options are:\n\n\n\nEntire Library\n\r\n\n\n\nThis is the default, showing everything in the Library.\n\n\n\r\n\nOriginal Audio Only\n\r\n\n\n\nThis shows audio that you’ve recorded or imported into Ferrite. It doesn’t show any projects.\n\n\n\r\n\nProjects Only\n\r\n\n\n\nThis only shows projects you’ve created, hiding all audio.\n\n\n\r\n\nProjects &amp; Unused Audio\n\r\n\n\n\nThe power-user’s favourite. This shows all your projects, and all the other audio that hasn’t yet been used in a project. Audio disappears from this list as it gets used, “hiding inside” the projects that use it. You’ll still see the audio in your projects when you view a project’s info, or by changing to a different filter.\n\n\n\r\n\nArchives Only\n\r\n\n\n\nIf you have \nArchived\n old projects, this will show only those Archives still on your device.\n\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\nAt the the top of the Library, above the recording controls, is the \n\nSearch\n\n box. Often, it’s tucked up out of sight, but you can reveal it by pulling the Library downwards with your finger. Typing into the box filters the Library, showing only the items whose names contain the text you’ve typed.\n\nIf you’ve applied any tags to items in your Library, then a \n\nTag\n\n button will show up at the far right of the Search box. Tap this to show (or hide) all the tags you’ve used. Tap tags to select\/deselect them. If you have any tags selected, only items with those tags will be shown. More detail can be found in the \nTagging\n chapter of this guide.\n\nThe Library is normally sorted by the date the items were last edited, latest first. This keeps the items you’ve used most recently at the top of the list for quick access. You can change the order, to sort by when the item was created, or alphabetically by name, or by duration, by tapping the Sort Button. The Sort Button is next to the Search box, and its icon changes to show the current sorting:\n\n*    A calendar when sorting by date\n*    A-to-Z when sorting by name\n*    A clock when sorting by duration\r\n\n## Audio Info and Preproduction\n\nFor detailed info about an audio file, tap to select it, then tap the \n\nInfo\n\n button. This will pop up a panel showing technical information about your audio, including the duration, time of recording, the amount of space the recording is using on your device, the format &amp; quality it is stored in, and more.\n\nIt also will tell you how many projects (if any) use the item — tap the number to list those projects (you can then tap a project to return to the Library, with that project selected). If you delete the audio, those projects will be changed, as the audio will be removed from them.\n\n\n\n\n**Note:** There may be a second section in this list. If so, it shows projects which don’t _currently_ use this audio, but did in the past.\n\nThe audio was removed from these projects, so deleting the audio won’t affect them in their current form — but if you were to open any of those projects, then tap \n\nUndo\n\n far enough to try to restore the audio to it, it won’t work: the audio clips do reappear in the project timeline, but they are blank with a warning ⚠️ icon on them, and will be silent when you play the project.\n\n\n\r\n\nYou can rename a piece of audio by tapping its name in the Audio Info panel.\n\nYou can also “tag” audio from here — see the \nTagging\n chapter for more information on this.\n\nIf you have added bookmarks to the recording, these will also be listed here. Tap a bookmark to select it and jump the preview to that moment in the recording. Tap the selected bookmark again to edit the text. To remove a bookmark you no longer need, swipe the bookmark to the left, then tap the delete button that appears.\n\nYou can add new bookmarks in this panel as well. Just tap the \n\nBookmark\n\n button in the Audio Info title bar, and the current position in the preview will be bookmarked.\n\nWhen browsing the Library, any audio with bookmarks will have a small bookmark icon next to it, by the duration\/date information.\n\n### Preproduction\n\n*   Preproduction is only available to customers who have purchased the Ferrite 2 Pro upgrade\r\n\nMost kinds of editing are performed in the Project Editor and can be adjusted live. But there are also a few features that help you prepare an audio file for editing, before you begin. These features are filed under “Preproduction”.\n\nMany audio files don’t need preproduction, so initially it will be switched off. If you tap on the Preproduction section of the Audio Info panel, you can set it up for that audio file.\n\nUsing Preproduction, you can apply:\n\n\n\nAuto Levelling\n\r\n\n\n\nLike the \nFinal Mix\n feature, this will smooth out the volume levels of the audio. This can help when editing very quiet audio, as it improves the quality of the previews. It can also be useful if you simply want to smooth the levels of a single audio clip instead of an entire project, or want control over the Final Mix while still taking advantage of Auto Levelling.\n\n\n\r\n\nNoise Reduction\n\r\n\n\n\nIf you have a recording with “hiss” or similar noise in it, this may be able to remove it. It will identify pieces of the audio that are supposed to be silent (but have noise in them), analyse them to develop a “fingerprint” of the noise, then use that fingerprint to identify and attempt to remove it from the entire audio clip. Noise Reduction cannot reduce all kinds of noise, but it can help with relatively consistent sources of noise.\n\n\n\r\n\nBoost Quiet Audio\n\r\n\n\n\nThis is only available when Noise Reduction is enabled, as it changes the way Noise Reduction works. It adds an extra boost to the levels before Noise Reduction is applied. This is because without it, if you have audio that has noise you want to remove, but the audio you want to keep is also very quiet, Noise Reduction may have difficulty telling them apart.\n\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\nWhen you change Preproduction settings, all projects that use the audio file will be affected by your changes. The original audio file is not modified though — Preproduction creates additional audio data as needed. If you turn Preproduction back off, your original audio will be used unchanged.\n\nPreproduction requires additional space to store processed audio. When Preproduction is enabled for an audio file, the amount of space used is shown in the Preproduction section of the Audio Info panel.\n\n### Channel Selection\n\n*   Channel Selection is only available to customers who have purchased the Ferrite 2 Pro upgrade\r\n\nFerrite edits projects in either mono (1 channel) or stereo (2 channels, left and right). If you make or import recordings with three or more channels, Channel Selection helps you deal with those recordings.\n\nIf you use an audio file that has three or more channels, Ferrite will use the first two channels as a stereo pair. In the Audio Info screen, next to the format, this will be shown by the message “Using Channels 1 and 2”. If you want to change this, tap on it to show the Channel Selection panel.\n\nThis lists all the channels, whether in use or not. Each has a Play\/Pause\/Stop button (the same as in the Audio Library) allowing you to listen to each channel and figure out which is which.\n\nOn the right-hand side it will show if the channel is being used as a single mono channel, or as the left or right channel of a stereo pair, or not used at all.\n\nTap on a channel to toggle it on or off. You must always have one channel selected. You can’t turn on more than two channels, but you can split them off into a separate clip in the Audio Library so you can edit them independently. You can do this by tapping “Split Unused” or by dragging-and-dropping channels from the Use Channels section to the Make New Files section.\n\n\n\n\n**Note:** If you have Preproduction enabled when you split channels into new files, your Preproduction settings will be applied to them as they are split off.\n\nAlternatively, you can split off the channels before applying Preproduction, allowing you to pick different Preproduction settings for each channel.\n\n\n\r\n\n## Project Info\n\nProjects also have an \n\nInfo\n\n screen. From here, you can see which audio recordings they use, the duration and so on. You can also set the information that will be included in the project if you export it to an audio file, such as the project’s name, the creator’s name, the genre to file it under, copyright info, cover artwork and notes\/lyrics.\n\nJust tap the entry and type in the appropriate info. Some items also have a button that will help fill in the info more quickly. For example, you can pick a name out of your Contacts list, import a photo from your Photo Library to use as cover art, fill in copyright info automatically, or pick a genre from a list.\n\nIf the project was created from a \ntemplate\n, that template’s name will be shown, and you can tap on the button to navigate to it.\n\n*   Templates, and customised project export filenames and file formats are only available to customers who have purchased the Ferrite 2 Pro upgrade\r\n\nYou can set an export name for the project. This is the filename that will be used when you send the project audio to another app. Although some apps will ignore it, many will use it as the name to save the audio with. If you don’t fill it in, it defaults to the same as the title. Note that the extension is always set automatically to match your chosen Sharing Format.\n\n    Typically, the \nSharing Format is chosen in the settings\n where you can set it up once, and then it will be used for all projects. However, if a project has different requirements, you can override it here in the Project Info screen.\n\n    Just like with audio, you can tag your projects to quickly find them later (see the \nTagging\n section).\n\n    To remove cover art, hold your finger down on the image until Ferrite asks you to confirm its deletion.\n\n    In the Pro version, the top-left corner of the Project Info panel has a \n\nTools\n\n button. This provides quick access to some common Ferrite&nbsp;2&nbsp;Pro project tools. These tools are also available from the Share Sheet, and include features such as making \nTemplates\n or \nArchives\n from the project.\n\n# Editing\n\n## Editing Overview\n\nThe usual way to create a project is to either:\n\n*   Tap on a piece of audio in the Library, then tap \n\nEdit\n\n, or,\n*   Tap \n\nSelect\n\n in the Library, pick several pieces of audio, then tap \n\nEdit\n\n in the toolbar.\r\n\nEither way, a new project will be created, and it will contain the audio you selected. You can add more later (see \nEditing Tracks\n below).\n\n\n\n\n**Note:** To continue editing a project later, you can tap on it, then tap \n\nEdit\n\n, just like for audio.\n\nIf you tap on the _original_ audio and tap its  \n\nEdit\n\n button again, you will instead create a new, separate project based on the same original audio.\n\n\n\r\n\nThe main editing screen consists of:\n\n*   The Time Bar along the top of the screen: This acts like a “ruler” that marks off minutes and seconds, instead of inches or centimetres. As well as helping you see where you are in the project, there’s also a triangular marker, the “Play Head”, which shows where playback will start from next. You can drag the Play Head to move it, or tap to jump it to a new position.\n*   The tracks: below the Time Bar are the tracks. Each track is a container, into which you can place clips of audio. Each track can be playing one clip of audio at any given moment, and the sound of all the tracks is mixed together to make the Final Mix, the result of your project. How you organise your tracks is up to you, but you might choose to use one for background music, another for field-recorded interviews, and another for studio voice-over, for example. Clips of audio are placed on the tracks and can be moved around to position them earlier or later in the mix, trimmed shorter, and so on.\n*   Below the tracks is the \nFinal Mix\n bar, for settings that affect the whole project, after the tracks have been mixed together.\n*   Below the Final Mix bar, an \n\n+\n Add\n button allows you to add new tracks.\n*   The \n\nImport\n\n button is also there, and pops open your Library. Tapping a piece of audio will add it to the project.\n*   At the bottom of the screen is the toolbar.\r\n\nThe toolbar contains the following controls:\n\n\n\n\n\nDocument Save\n\n\n\r\n\n\n\nCloses your project and returns to the Library.\n\nAlthough this is called “Save”, in Ferrite your project is _always_ saved, automatically. For example, if you run out of battery while editing, everything you’ve done up to that point is still saved.\n\nYou can also hold it down for about a second to enter \nHistory\n\n\n\n\r\n\n\n\nUndo\n\n  \n\n\nRedo\n\n\n\r\n\n\n\nThese let you change your mind about edits you’ve made. In Ferrite, as long as you haven’t deleted the recordings from your Library, you can always undo your edits&nbsp;– all the way back to the creation of the project if you wish! In fact, in Ferrite, Undo &amp; Redo continue to work even if you’ve closed the project, quit the app, and switched your device off and back on again\n\n\n\r\n\n00:00:00\n\r\n\n\n\nThe Time Display indicates the “current” time — that is, the time the Play Head is positioned at. Below it is a bar, like a progress bar, showing how far through the project the Play Head is, relative to the complete length of the project. You can drag left or right anywhere on the Time Display to rapidly move the Play Head through the project. Tap the Time Display for the Time Display Options menu (see \nNavigation\n below).\n\n\n\r\n\n\n\nRewind\n\n\n\r\n\n\n\nJumps the Play Head backwards in time. See Navigation for more.\n\n\n\r\n\n\n\nPlay\n\n  \n\n\nPause\n\n\n\r\n\n\n\nStarts or stops playback, at the Play Head’s current position.\n\n\n\r\n\n\n\nFast Forward\n\n\n\r\n\n\n\nJumps the Play Head forwards in time. See \nNavigation\n for more.\n\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n### On Smaller Screens\n\nIf there isn’t room for all the controls (mainly on the iPhone in “portrait” orientation), some of them will be combined to save space. Undo and Redo can be combined, and so can Rewind and Fast Forward. When this happens:\n\n*   The button will show the Undo or Rewind option as normal, but the Redo or Fast Forward option will be shown smaller &amp; faintly\n*   Tapping the button will Undo or Rewind\n*   Holding the button will “unfold” the two buttons into a popup\n*   When the popup is shown, you can keep tapping the buttons and it won’t fold away, so you can Undo\/Redo or Rewind\/Fast Forward as many steps as you like without having to unfold it again\n*   Tap the \n\nX\n\n to close the popup\r\n\n\n\n**Tip:** If you place your finger on the combined button, and swipe upwards, towards where the Redo or Fast Forward button will appear, it will activate that command without unfolding.\n\n\n\r\n\n### Navigation\n\nWhen you first open a project, the entire duration is shown. To see and work with your audio in more detail, you can zoom in, using the standard iOS “Pinch to Zoom” gesture. You can pan around by swiping\/dragging the project, just as you would pan a zoomed-in photo or web page.\n\nIf you play back your project while zoomed in, Ferrite normally follows along with the Play Head, panning to keep it in view. You can turn this off by tapping the Time Display, which pops up a menu with a \nFollow Along\n switch. From here, you can also zoom in on the selection (if you have a clip or clips selected), zoom back out to the whole project, or jump to the Play Head.\n\nThe \n\nRewind\n\n and \n\nFast Forward\n\n buttons jump the Play Head by moving it to where an audio clip starts or ends. Each tap finds the next start\/end in that direction. If your recordings contain bookmarks, it will find those, too: Bookmarks are shown as small dots in the Time Bar. When the Play Head is stopped at one, a small extract of the bookmark’s text is also shown.\n\nYou can also hold the buttons down, to jump quickly to the very beginning or end of the project.\n\n## Editing Tracks\n\nThere are some controls that affect an entire track. These controls live on a sheet of glass at the left-hand side of the track, and can be folded out of the way to make more room for editing (on iPhone, where the screen is smaller, they are automatically folded in Portrait view). To unfold them, swipe your finger out from the very edge of the screen. You will see:\n\n\n\nTools Button\n\r\n\n\n\nOpens the Track Tools Menu. This contains more track commands, including those to turn Automation and Effects on or off, and is described in more detail below.\n\n\n\r\n\nPlay \/ Mute \/ Solo Button\n\r\n\n\n\nA “speaker” icon. If the track is muted, it will have an X next to it. If soloed, it will have a star next to it. Tap to change modes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay\n\n\n\nThe track plays normally, as long as no tracks have been soloed.\n\n\n\n\r\n\n\nMute\n\n\n\nThe track is always silent. Muted tracks are shown grayed out.\n\n\n\n\r\n\n\nSolo\n\n\n\nThe soloed track will play, but all other tracks will be silenced (unless they are also soloed). Silenced tracks show their audio clips grayed out.\n\n\n\n\r\n\n\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\nTrack Volume\n\r\n\n\n\nA dial that sets the loudness of the track.\n\n\n\r\n\nTrack Pan\n\r\n\n\n\nA dial that adjusts the stereo position of the track, pushing it toward the left or right speakers.\n\n\n\r\n\nVU Meters\n\r\n\n\n\nThese display the audio volume levels, for the track’s left and right channels. They’re measured in decibels, relative to the maximum level that can be played without “clipping”. They show the output level —&nbsp;the volume level after all the effects, panning and the track volume control have been applied.\n\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\nThe Track Tools menu lets you:\n\n*   Play, Mute or Solo a track\n*   Specify \nDucking\n for a track\n*   Edit the \nTrack Effects\n\n*   Add \nAutomation\n to the track\n*   Select all the audio on a track\n*   Delete a track you no longer need. Remember, deleting a track only removes its audio clips from the project. No audio is deleted from your device when you do this.\n*   Open the Ducking Settings (these apply to the entire project)\n*   Show or hide all the Automation tracks.\n*   Change the order that tracks appear in (this has no effect on the resulting audio, it’s just so you can keep your projects organised if you wish).\r\n\n### Ducking\n\nDucking is where the volume of some audio is automatically lowered whenever another piece of audio is playing, so as not to interfere with it. For example, you might want some background music to be “ducked down” behind a voice-over. A track can either be:\n\n\n\nDuck King\n\r\n\n\n\nWhen a track is a Duck King it will always play at its regular volume, and other tracks will “duck under” it. You might set this on the voice-over, for example.\n\n\n\r\n\nDuck\n\r\n\n\n\nWhen a track is Ducked, it will turn its volume down automatically when a Duck King track is playing. It will turn itself back up again when the Duck King is quiet. You might set this on the background music.\n\n\n\r\n\nDuck Off\n\r\n\n\n\nWhen a track is told to Duck Off, it doesn’t participate in ducking at all. It won’t turn its volume down, and it won’t cause other tracks to turn theirs down either.\n\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\nIf you open the Ducking Settings panel, you can adjust the ducker’s sensitivity, speed and strength. The \nThreshold\n is the loudness the Duck King must be below, to be considered silent. The \nSpeed\n is how quickly you want to the other tracks to turn themselves down when the Duck King starts playing, or back up when it stops. The \nStrength\n controls how much the other tracks turn themselves down by. The Ducking Settings affect ducking across the whole project.\n\n### Final Mix\n\nEach track in your project is mixed together to produce the finished result. The Final Mix bar represents this mixed-together audio — the left and right VU Meters on the bar measure the final volume of your mix: the audio as it will be shared\/exported.\n\nYou can also add \nAutomation\n and \nEffects\n to the Final Mix, just like you can for tracks. For example, if you want to fade the entire project in\/out at the beginning\/end, setting up Volume Automation on the Final Mix is usually easier than adding it to each individual track. Tap the \n\nFinal Mix\n\n button to open the Final Mix Tools menu.\n\n### Post Production\n\n*   Post Production is only available to customers who have purchased the Pro upgrade\r\n\nThe Final Mix menu is also home to Post Production commands: these are powerful commands that take too long to apply “live” — you can’t hear them while you’re editing your project, but they can be applied when it’s finished and you share it.\n\n\n\nAuto Levelling\n\r\n\n\n\nThis command will analyse your completed project and automatically adjust volume levels to try and keep them smooth and even. Quieter sections will be turned up, louder sections will be turned down, and “clipping” will be avoided — it’s like a smart compressor, normaliser and peak limiter all in one.\n\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\nPost Production is also where you can create \nMP3 Chapters\n.\n\n## Basic Edits\n\nAudio clips are shown as blocks, placed on the tracks, with a picture of their audio waveform on them.\n\nYou can select any clip of audio by tapping on it. If you’ve added more audio, you can tap a different clip to change the selection, or tap some empty space to clear the selection.\n\nSelected clips can be moved simply by dragging them around with your finger. You can drag them left or right to move them earlier or later in the project timeline, or you can drag them up and down to move them from one track to another.\n\nYou can split the audio into separate pieces simply by swiping your finger from the top of the selected clip, to the bottom, at the position where you want to the split to occur. Like cutting a loaf of bread with a knife, or opening the zipper on a jacket, swiping downwards across the clip separates it into two pieces.\n\nTo join clips together, push them against each other, then swipe upwards — just like cutting, but in the other direction.\n\n\n\n\n**Tip:** If you find these gestures tricky, you can also split and join clips using the \nEditing Menu\n. It’s worth practicing the gestures, though, as they’re real time-savers!\n\n\n\r\n\nIf you need greater accuracy while making cuts, you may find it helpful to zoom in on your project — the closer you’re zoomed in, the easier it is to make precise edits because everything is larger relative to your finger.\n\nAnother way to get greater accuracy is to move the Play Head to the position you want the cut or join to occur. The Play Head has a line extending down across your project: when you swipe your finger along this line, Ferrite understands that you want to cut precisely at the Play Head even if your finger wobbles a bit.\n\n### More Editing\n\nYou can drag the edges of a clip to shorten or lengthen it. Dragging the clip to be shorter (from either end) trims unwanted audio from the clip, but the audio isn’t permanently destroyed (audio is never permanently destroyed in Ferrite unless you delete the audio from the Library). If you drag the clip back out again, it “uncovers” the hidden audio.\n\nThis works even if you delete a piece of audio from inside a clip — for example, by swiping twice, to split the audio into three clips, then deleting the middle clip. You can restore it by extending either of the outer two pieces to fill the gap.\n\n(Of course, if you made a mistake in deleting a clip, you would normally just tap \n\nUndo\n\n to restore it. But if you’ve made other changes since, and later decide you want to restore some of the audio you removed earlier, you can do that just by dragging the edges.)\n\n## Advanced Edits\n\nYou can easily make clips fade in or out: When a clip is selected, you’ll see a couple of handles with “ramps” inside them, sat at the top of the clip. Drag these to adjust the duration of the fade: the handle marks the point at which the clip will be at its full volume (whatever you’ve set with the Track Volume dial).\n\nYou can also crossfade between pieces of audio. A track can mostly play only one piece of audio at once —&nbsp;if you need two pieces to play at the same time, you should place one of the pieces on a separate track. But, if you drag a piece of audio so that it overlaps another piece, Ferrite will create a crossfade between them.\n\nIt will show the crossfade using shaded areas, similar to the fade in\/out at the edges of a clip. The crossfade’s duration is set by how much the clips overlap.\n\nIf you position a piece so that it’s _completely_ contained within another piece (instead of just partially overlapping it), Ferrite will crossfade to it at the start, and crossfade back at the end. The timing of the crossfade is controlled by the usual fade in\/fade out controls on the “inner” clip.\n\n\n\n\n**Tip:** This can be useful for “bleeping out” words. If you keep a bleep sound effect in your Library (or a cartoon sound effect, or whatever you prefer), then you can just drop it in on top of the word(s) you want to remove.\n\n\n\r\n\n    If you already have two pieces of audio overlapping, and try to drag a third so that it overlaps both of them, the clip you are dragging will light up red and turn ghostly, showing that Ferrite will not let you drop it there. When you let go, the clip will scoot back to its original position.\n\n## Editing Menu\n\nIf you tap on a selected clip, a menu will pop up, with a number of additional commands:\n\n\n\nCut\n\r\n\n\n\nCopy the audio clip to the Pasteboard, then Delete it.\n\n\n\r\n\nCopy\n\r\n\n\n\nCopy the audio clip to the Pasteboard.\n\n\n\n\n**Note:** Clips copied this way can’t be pasted into other apps. To send audio to another app, pick an item in the Library, and tap Share.  \n\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\nPaste\n\r\n\n\n\nPaste audio clips that you previously Cut or Copied. This will not appear if the Pasteboard is empty, or if pasting it at this location would cause too many pieces of audio to overlap.\n\n\n\r\n\nDelete\n\r\n\n\n\nRemove the selected clips from the project.\n\n(Remember, the audio files themselves are not permanently removed)\n\n\n\r\n\nSplit\n\r\n\n\n\nSplit the selected audio clip into two pieces, the same as swiping down across the clip. You can use this to split several clips at the same time (see \nMultiple Selections\n).\n\n\n\r\n\nJoin\n\r\n\n\n\nJoin the selected audio clips together, the same as swiping up across the join between them. They must be pushed up against each other first.\n\n\n\r\n\nZoom\n\r\n\n\n\nZoom the display in or out until the selection fills the screen.\n\n\n\r\n\nImport…\n\r\n\n\n\nOpens a browser showing your Library. You can pick an audio item to be added to the project; it will be inserted at the selected track and time.\n\n\n\r\n\nStrip Silence…\n\r\n\n\n\nRemove silent sections from the selected audio.\n\n\n\r\n\nTighten…\n\r\n\n\n\nPack together audio clips to tighten up the timing of tracks.\n\n(not available in free version)\n\n\n\r\n\nShare…\n\r\n\n\n\nShare either a single audio file created using all the selected clips, or a zip file containing an audio file for each selected clip. This includes the results of effects and automation.\n\n(not available in free version)\n\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\nAs well as tapping on selected clips, you can also tap on the empty space of a track to pop open the menu. If you had a clip selected already, this will deselect it, but otherwise, the menu will appear, showing the commands that work even without a clip selected (“Paste” and “Import…”).\n\n### Strip Silence\n\nThe “Strip Silence…” command slices out silent (or nearly-silent) parts of an audio clip. If you’re familiar with a “noise gate”, it’s similar, but the quiet portions are removed from the project altogether, not just silenced.\n\nStrip Silence splits a single clip up into several clips, one for each continuous section of sound. For example, if you have a recording of someone “speaking… with… long… pauses… between… each… word… like… Shatner… or… Walken…” then apply Strip Silence to it, you will end up with one clip for each word, with empty space in the project where the pauses used to be.\n\nWhen you select the command, the Strip Silence control panel appears at the bottom of the screen. As you adjust the controls, blue shading will mark the regions that will be cut out (for very long pieces of audio, the Strip Silence command may take a little time to update when you change the controls. You’ll see a progress bar below them while this happens).\n\nThere are three Strip Silence controls:\n\n\n\nThreshold\n\r\n\n\n\nSections of audio are only removed if they’re quieter than this level.\n\n\n\r\n\nEdge Fade\n\r\n\n\n\nWith this switched off, you’ll get hard cuts between the sound and silent sections. Increase the fading, and the Strip Silence command will fade in just before the start of each piece of audio, then fade out when it returns to silence.\n\n\n\r\n\nMinimum Silence\n\r\n\n\n\nThis is the minimum duration of silence between two sections of audio. If you’re working with very long audio, you should probably turn this up so your timeline doesn’t resemble the aftermath of a hailstorm. This can be particularly useful for projects such as interviews, if you have a separate recording for each participant.\n\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\nOnce you tap the Done button to confirm the command, the sections marked in blue are deleted from the timeline. Note that the audio left behind is not moved to fill the gaps — the timing of your project is unchanged. You can use the \nTighten Audio\n command afterwards if you want to “ripple” all the deleted sections.\n\n\n\n\n**Tip:** Like all edits in Ferrite, Strip Silence is non-destructive: the silent parts of the audio are removed from the project, but they are not removed from your device, and can be restored either by tapping Undo, by dragging the edges of the pieces to “uncover” more of the audio, or even simply adding the audio back into the project.\n\n\n\r\n\n\n\n**Note:** While the panel is open, you can zoom in and out of your project, pan around, and listen to it, but you can’t make edits until you either confirm or cancel the Strip Silence command.\n\n\n\r\n\n### Tighten Audio\n\n*   The Tighten command is only available to paying customers\r\n\nAfter using the Strip Silence command, or after some manual editing, you might have a bunch of clips with gaps between them. The Tighten command takes those gaps out so that the clips are pushed against each other.\n\nSelect two or more clips, and pick Tighten… from the menu. The Tighten control panel appears at the bottom of the screen, and the selected audio clips will move to their new positions.\n\n\n\nAmount\n\r\n\n\n\nControls how much Tightening is applied. At zero, there’s no change from the original clip positions, but as you turn it up, the clips are pulled towards each other.\n\n\n\r\n\nMinimum Silence\n\r\n\n\n\nThis is the minimum duration of silence between two audio clips. At zero, clips will be pushed right up against each other, but this can sound unnatural, since people usually need to take a moment to breathe between sentences.\n\nTurning this up will set a minimum gap between clips. This affects only clips that are Tightened: clips that were already closer than this, will not be pushed apart.\n\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\nYou can select clips across multiple tracks — even the whole project, if you like. When you Tighten clips across tracks, they move with each other, so that if, for example, you have an interview with two people, one on each track, their questions and answers won’t get out of order.\n\n    If you have \nAutomation\n Control Points selected as well as audio, then when you tighten the audio, those Control Points will be moved to match the audio they were lined up with.\n\n\n\n\n**Note:** While the panel is open, you can zoom in and out of your project, pan around, and listen to it, but you can’t make edits until you either confirm or cancel the Tighten command.\n\n\n\r\n\n### Ripple Insert And Delete\n\nWhen you delete a clip, you’ll see some blue shading in the area where the clip used to be, and you’ll be offered the choice to “Ripple” the delete. If you Ripple a delete, it means that any audio after it in the track will slide along by the length of the audio you just removed. So for example, if you did this:\n\n*   Opened a project with a single 10-second clip of audio at the start of the project\n*   Split the clip at 3 seconds into the project (you’ll now have two clips, one directly after the other: a 3 second clip, then a 7 second clip.)\n*   Selected the first clip, and deleted it\r\n\n…then if you _don’t_ Ripple, you’ll have a project with 3 seconds of empty space at the start, and then the rest of the clip. If you wanted to insert a different piece of audio there, this is probably what you want.\n\nBut, if you tap Ripple, the second clip (7 seconds) will slide to the beginning of the project, with no gap. This is probably what you want, if you just wanted to trim off some unnecessary audio from the start of the clip.\n\nThe Ripple Menu also offers an “All Tracks” option which applies the same ripple across every track, not just the one you deleted from.\n\nIf you don’t want to Ripple, just tap anywhere else to dismiss the Ripple menu.\n\n(If you _never_ want to Ripple, you can turn the feature off entirely in Ferrite’s \nSettings\n.)\n\nWhenever you import or paste audio, you’ll be offered the choice to “Ripple” it too. This is similar to Ripple Delete, but in the other direction: any audio in the track after the piece you added, will be moved along to make room for it.\n\nJust like with Ripple Delete, you have the choice to Ripple Insert on one track or all tracks, and the feature can be turned off entirely in the Settings.\n\n### Multiple Selections\n\nYou can select more than one clip at once. If you do, you can edit all the selected clips in one go:\n\n*   You can cut, copy or delete all the selected clips\n*   You can move the selected clips around the project\n*   If you make a split using the editing menu, it will extend across the entire selection at that point in time, so you can cut several tracks at once, at exactly the same spot.\r\n\nYou can’t crop\/uncrop, or fade in\/out multiple clips at once.\n\nTo select multiple clips:\n\n*   Hold your finger down on a clip, as though you were going to drag it. But don’t move it yet.\n*   While holding it, tap another clip. It will be added to the selection\n*   If you tap an already-selected clip, it will be removed from the selection.\r\n\nIt can often be convenient to select everything past a certain point on a track. You can do this by selecting a clip, then double-tapping on it: all of the clips after it on the same track will be added to the selection. Triple-tap, and it will extend this across _all_ tracks in the project.\n\n    You can also select all the clips on a single track from the Track Tools menu. And there’s a short-cut for adding clips to the selection, using some “optional extra” \nTwo Finger Editing Gestures\n or the \nApple Pencil™\n.\n\n## Effects\n\n*   Effects are only available to customers who have purchased the Pro upgrade\r\n\nFrom the Track Tools menu, you can add effects to your tracks. Effects change the way a track sounds when it’s played back. Because they’re only applied at the moment the sound is sent to the speakers (or exported), you can adjust them as often as you like.\n\n    When you open the Effects submenu, you’ll see a list of the effects available (also shown below). Tap one to add it to the track. To remove it, or change the order in which the effects are applied, tap the \n\nEdit\n\n button.\n\nOnce you’ve added an effect, tap it again to open its settings. The settings depend on the effect, but are usually dials that control how strongly the effect should be applied, how quickly the effect should respond to changes in your audio, and so on.\n\n    You can also \nAutomate\n effect settings. If you’ve automated a setting, its dial will be disabled.\n\n\n\nCompressor\n\r\n\n\n\nA dynamic range compressor. A sort of souped-up automatic gain control, it makes quiet sounds louder, and loud sounds quieter.\n\n\n\r\n\nEqualiser\n\r\n\n\n\nA sophisticated multi-band equaliser and visualiser. Allows you to view and shape the frequency bands of your audio. \nSee below\n for more information on this effect.\n\n\n\r\n\nHigh Pass Filter\n\r\n\n\n\nCuts off any sounds below a certain frequency. Can give the sound a tinny, telephone-like quality. Can also remove some kinds of low-pitched rumble.\n\n\n\r\n\nLow Pass Filter\n\r\n\n\n\nCuts off any sounds above a certain frequency. Can give a muffled or distant quality to sound, or remove some kinds of high-pitched noise.\n\n\n\r\n\nMid-Side Decode\n\r\n\n\n\nSome high-end field recorders have a “Mid-Side Stereo Recording” feature. Instead of recording separate left and right channels, they record a “middle” channel and a “side” channel. If you play back audio recorded using this encoding in an app that expects regular stereo audio, it can sound strange. This effect decodes Mid-Side recordings into regular stereo for use in Ferrite. You can set the amount of stereo spread, making the result sound “wide” or “narrow”. You also need to tell it which channel is the “side” channel — this information should be in the user guide for your field recorder.\n\nIf you use Mid-Side Decode, you should **always place it first** (at the top) of the effects for a particular track, and you should only place Mid-Side clips on that track.\n\n\n\r\n\nNoise Gate\n\r\n\n\n\nCuts off any sounds below a loudness threshold. Often used when you’ve recorded someone speaking but have background noise — it can’t remove the noise while they’re talking, but at least in the pauses, the noise will be silenced.\n\n\n\r\n\nWarm Amplifier\n\r\n\n\n\nA warm, resonant amplifier which can add “presence” or “richness” to a track.\n\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\nYou may also see additional effects. These are not part of Ferrite, but are “plugins” that can be used with it. See \nAudio Unit Extensions\n for more on this.\n\n### Equaliser\n\nThe equaliser effect boosts or reduces audio according to frequency. It’s very customisable — you can add up to 8 “bands”, each of which can boost or reduce a different range of frequencies by a different amount.\n\nYou control the equaliser using a graph that both shows the bands you have added, and (optionally) the frequencies of the audio as it plays. A sliding control below the graph allows you to switch the visualiser off, set it to show the frequencies of the original audio before the equaliser affects it, or the frequencies of the audio after the equaliser has boosted or reduced the audio.\n\nOn the graph are a dashed line marking “0&nbsp;dB” (the point at which audio is neither boosted nor reduced), and a series of circles, one for each band you have added. Bands come in different types — an icon inside the circle shows what type it is.\n\n*   Tap the \n\n+\n Add\n button to add a new band.\n*   Tap a band to select it.\n*   The frequency (and the gain and bandwidth, where supported) for the currently selected band are shown at the top of the equaliser control panel.\n*   Tap the selected band to delete it or change its type. The types are:\r\n\n\nOff\n\r\n\n\n\nSet this type to temporarily switch a band off without deleting it.\n\n\n\r\n\nParametric\n\r\n\n\n\nA flexible general-purpose type that boosts or reduces audio frequencies close to the band frequency.\n\n\n\r\n\nLow Pass\n\r\n\n\n\nAllows audio through if it’s lower-frequency than the band frequency, blocks audio if it’s higher frequency. (Available in regular and resonant variations.)\n\n\n\r\n\nHigh Pass\n\r\n\n\n\nAllows audio through if it’s higher-frequency than the band frequency, blocks audio if it’s lower frequency. (Available in regular and resonant variations.)\n\n\n\r\n\nBand Pass\n\r\n\n\n\nAllows frequencies through only if they are close to the band frequency.\n\n\n\r\n\nNotch Cut\n\r\n\n\n\nRemoves frequencies if they are close to the band frequency.\n\n\n\r\n\nLow Shelf\n\r\n\n\n\nBoost or reduce frequencies lower than the band frequency. (Available in regular and resonant variations.)\n\n\n\r\n\nHigh Shelf\n\r\n\n\n\nBoost or reduce frequencies higher than the band frequency. (Available in regular and resonant variations.)\n\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n*   Drag the band left or right to adjust the frequency the band affects.\n*   Drag the band up or down to increase or decrease the gain. (Not all types support gain control. Parametric and Shelf types do, the others always remove as much of the blocked frequencies as they are able).\n*   Pinch\/unpinch the band to increase or decrease the bandwidth. The wider the bandwidth, the wider the range of frequencies are affected. (Not all types support bandwidth control. Parametric, Band Pass and Notch Cut do; the others only support bandwidth in the Resonant variations.).\r\n\nEach band has a letter associated with it (A thru H). If you automate EQ parameters, you can use this to make sure you are automating the right bands. When an EQ parameter is automated, you won’t be able to edit it in the EQ control panel — it will instead track the automation during playback.\n\n## Automation\n\n*   Automation is only available to customers who have purchased the Pro upgrade\r\n\n    The volume and panning of a track, and the settings of \nEffects\n you have added, can be set to automatically change over time.\n\nFor something like a simple fade in\/fade out, it’s usually easier to just use the fade handles on an audio clip. Automation is useful when you need complex or precise control, or to affect the Final Mix.\n\nTap the \n\nTools Menu\n\n button for the track you want to automate (or tap the Final Mix), then tap Automation to see the list of things that can be automated. For a new track, this will be Volume and Pan, but if you’ve added effects to your track, their settings will appear here too.\n\nPick the setting you want to automate — for example, “Track Panning”. This will create a new Automation Track and attach it to the bottom of the regular audio track (it will also disable the dial you would usually use to control the setting, since the Automation Track is in charge of that now).\n\nYou can stack up a whole list of automation tracks if you like. When you scroll through them, the audio track they are attached to will “stick” when it hits the top of the screen, so you can always see how the automation lines up with the audio. (From the Track Tools menu you can also hide all the automation tracks, to tidy up your screen.)\n\nEach automation track controls one setting, and displays a graph of how that setting changes over time. If you have the glass side panel showing, it contains an extra dial to assist in editing the automation.\n\n### Editing Automation Tracks\n\nAutomation is controlled using “Control Points”. Control Points are dots on the graph that you can move around. They record the value of the setting at a moment in time, e.g. “at 5 seconds from the start, the volume should be 100%”.\n\nIn between Control Points, Ferrite automatically slides the control to the new position, so it’s easy to create smooth fades, pans and other effects. You can change how it does this in the \nSettings\n: the default behaviour is to create a smooth curve that flows through all the points, but if you prefer, you can switch to using straight lines.\n\nThere are three different ways to edit Automation: \nPlay Head &amp; Dial\n, \nLive Recording\n, and \nGraph Editing\n. You can use whichever you prefer, or a combination.\n\n### Play Head \n&amp;\n Dial\n\nYou can move the Play Head to a particular time, then adjust the side panel dial for an automation track. If the Play Head is pointing to a Control Point when you adjust the dial, that Point will be adjusted. If not, a new Control Point will be added first, then adjusted.\n\n### Live Recording\n\nYou can press \n\nPlay\n\n, and while listening to your project, adjust the side panel dial. Your changes are recorded live, as a series of new Control Points, added to (or replacing) the existing ones.\n\nControl Points are only created as needed, so if, for example, there’s a long section where you want the setting to stay unchanged, it will simply mark the beginning and end of that section with the same value.\n\n### Graph Editing\n\nYou can adjust the graph in the timeline directly, by tapping, holding and dragging:\n\n\n\nTap\n\r\n\n\n\nCreate a Control Point. The Control Point will always start on the graph line, even if you tap above\/below the line.\n\n\n\r\n\nHold\n\r\n\n\n\nSee the exact value of the Control Point under your finger.\n\nIf you hold between two Control Points, it will show the values for both.\n\n#### With the value(s) showing:\n\n\n\r\n\nDrag Point Left\/Right\n\r\n\n\n\nMove the point earlier\/later in the timeline.\n\nTo delete a point, drag it until it “bumps into” another Control Point.\n\n\n\r\n\nDrag Point Up\/Down\n\r\n\n\n\nAdjust the value of the point(s).\n\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\n\n**Tip:** When editing the graph, you don’t need to tap\/drag exactly on the line or Control Point itself (since the line\/point might be right on the top or bottom edge of the track, that could be awkward). It’s usually easiest to tap\/drag in the vertical centre of the track.\n\n\n\r\n\n### Selecting Automation\n\nYou can select several automation Control Points at once, and move them all in a block. There are several ways to do this, and you can select automation and audio at the same time, so that they all move together:\n\n\n\nFingers\/Pencil\n\r\n\n\n\nThe \ntwo-finger swipe\n and \nApple Pencil™\n editing gestures can also work with automation Control Points, allowing you to quickly select or delete a bunch of them at once. You can adjust this behaviour in the \nSettings\n, if you prefer to select audio across multiple tracks without selecting any automation in between.\n\n\n\r\n\nThe “Select Automation (Toggle)” command\n\r\n\n\n\nFound in the \nShortcut Bar\n or the \nkeyboard shortcuts\n, this adds to the selection any Control Points contained within the time range of the selected audio clips. If all the Control Points that can be selected, already are, then it removes them from the selection, to leave only the audio selected.\n\n\n\r\n\nAutomatically Select\n\r\n\n\n\nYou can enable this in the \nSettings\n. Then, whenever you use commands like Select All, Select All Following etc to select multiple pieces of audio at once, Ferrite will also select matching automation Control Points (e.g. all the Control Points in the case of Select All, or all the Control Points from the selected audio onwards the case of Select All Following). Note: this setting doesn’t affect what happens when you just tap on a single piece of audio to select it.\n\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\nThe main use for this is sliding audio and automation left or right along the timeline, so they stay in sync. But, if you select several Control Points on a single automation track, you can also move them all up or down at once.\n\n\n\n\n**Note:** You can’t drag automation from track to track, so when you have Control Points selected, you can’t move the selection to a different track — remove the Control Points from the selection first.\n\n\n\r\n\n### Removing Automation\n\nIf you open the Track Tools Menu and pick Automation, you can simply tap on an automated setting to remove the automation. This will hide the automation track from the screen and switch off the automation, returning to manual control for that setting.\n\nYour automation isn’t deleted, though: it’s kept in case you need it again later. if you change your mind and turn automation back on for that setting, Ferrite will ask you if you wish to restore it. If you’re not sure, restore the automation and see if it’s what you want — you can always Undo if it isn’t.\n\n## MP3 Chapters\n\n*   Chapter editing is only available to customers who have purchased the Pro upgrade\r\n\n\n\n**Note:** Chapters will be included when you export an .MP3 or .WAV file, but not other audio file formats.\n\n.WAV file markers do not support features like images, links or hiding — Ferrite will add a “marker” at start of each chapter, containing the title.\n\nHowever, if you export your project as a video, in Ferrite&nbsp;2&nbsp;Pro, chapter images can be used to make a slideshow.\n\nYou can also share chapter information as .TXT or .JSON files from the project Share Sheet.        \n\n\n\r\n\nChapters are markers that you can place into projects at particular moments in time. While you _can_ use them to quickly jump around a project while editing it, they are designed to be included in the final .MP3 file when you export it, typically for use in podcasts. Many podcast players allow listeners to skip straight to the start of a chapter, and some can display custom artwork for each chapter, or allow a chapter to contain a link to a website.\n\nTo edit chapters, open the \nFinal Mix\n menu and tap “Edit MP3 Chapters” (you can also use the Shortcut Bar if you have that enabled). A panel slides over the editing area containing a list of chapters — initially, this will be blank.\n\nWhile the Chapters panel is open, you can’t edit your project, but you can still move the Play Head, use the Play\/Pause, Rewind\/Forward and Undo\/Redo controls, and pan\/zoom around. Tap outside of the panel to dismiss it.    \n\n    On iPhone — or on an iPad if you have used split-screen multitasking to reduce the screen space available to Ferrite — the Chapter panel will fill the screen. Play\/pause and navigation controls will appear at the bottom of the panel so you can listen to and move around your project.    \n\nTap the \n\n+\n Add\n button at the top of the Chapter panel to add a new chapter. The chapter will start at the Play Head’s current position, and continue either to the start of the next chapter, or the end of the project.\n\nTap the chapter to jump the Play Head to the start of that chapter.\n\nTap the chapter’s \n\nInfo\n\n button to edit its name, to add artwork or a link, or to move or delete the chapter.\n\nYou can also swipe on a chapter in the list to quickly move it to the Play Head or delete it.\n\n    On iPad, you can also create or update chapters by \ndragging and dropping\n text, links or images from other apps.    \n\nYou can save chapter \nPresets\n for re-use later — great for ad breaks or recurring segments in a show. These will include the title, link and artwork if present. You can create a bookmark the usual way, tap to edit it, then use the presets button to select the preset, but there’s also a shortcut: If you hold down the \n\n+\n Add Chapter\n button instead of tapping it, the presets list will appear and you can select a preset chapter to create at the Play Head.\n\n### “Hidden” Chapters\n\nIn the Chapter Info screen, you can set whether chapters appear in the Table of Contents. Normally, you want this to be on (the default), so listeners can skip straight to the chapter from the contents page. However, if you leave a chapter out of the contents, but give it artwork, well-behaved podcast players will still show the artwork at the relevant time. This can be useful if you want to create slideshows, add images relevant to the discussion, etc without cluttering up the table of contents.\n\n### Link To Audio\n\nChapters are normally locked to the timeline, meaning they only move if you move them yourself, but at the top of the chapter list is a switch you can flip to “Link to Audio”.\n\nWhen this is set, chapter markers will be automatically moved when you \nTighten Audio\n, or \nRipple Insert or Ripple Delete\n audio earlier than the chapter in the timeline.\n\nChapter markers will also be dragged when you move audio by hand, if the selection overlaps the chapter marker.\n\n# Additional Information\n\n## Compression and Sharing\n\nThere are many different formats for storing digital audio, each with their own advantages and disadvantages. Ferrite will import audio clips in many of the common ones so you can use them in your projects.\n\nWhen it comes to recording audio, or sharing projects, you have a choice of formats, depending on your needs. These choices are separate — you can record in one format, and share in another, if you wish.\n\n### Recording Original Audio\n\nWhen you record in Ferrite, your audio is compressed. Ferrite supports two different kinds of compression for recordings. You can select which in the \nSettings\n:\n\n\n\nLossy (AAC .m4a)\n\r\n\n\n\nThis is the default. It retains a high quality of audio while using less storage space. The recordings are stored as MPEG-4 Audio using Advanced Audio Coding, a widely supported format — it’s commonly used when you purchase or stream high-quality commercial music.\n\nAlthough the quality is very good, and most people cannot tell the difference, it is not perfect: some information is lost when using this type of compression.\n\n\n\r\n\nLossless (ALAC .caf)\n\r\n\n\n\nIf you need the best quality possible, this stores the audio perfectly. When you play it back, the audio signal is an exact, bit-for-bit match for what was recorded, but will also use more storage space. It’s not supported by as many other apps, but because it’s lossless, if you need to convert it for use in another app, that can be done without additional loss of quality.\n\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\n\n**Note:** This only affects the way that recordings are _stored_. Selecting perfect lossless compression does not guarantee perfect audio quality: it means that the audio is a perfect reproduction of what was received by Ferrite, which depends on many factors outside our control, such as your choice of microphone.\n\nFor example, if your original audio has hiss or other noise, picking Lossless just means that Ferrite will perfectly preserve that hiss or noise for you!\n\nChoosing a compression type only applies to recordings. If you import audio from your Music Library or another source, that audio is kept unchanged. For example, an imported .mp3 file is still kept in .mp3 format.\n\n\n\r\n\n### Sharing Original Audio\n\nWhen you export a recording — post it on a social networking site, send it to someone, or save it to a file storage service — Ferrite checks to see what format it is in.\n\nIf the audio is already appropriately compressed — if it was recorded in Lossy AAC\/.M4A format, or is an imported file that was already in that format, or a similar one — Ferrite will simply share the file as-is: it will not degrade the quality by decompressing it and recompressing it again. Otherwise Ferrite will export it in the Sharing Format chosen in the \nSettings\n — this defaults to Lossy AAC\/.M4A format. This is to save space, time and bandwidth, and because it’s widely supported by other services.\n\nIf you have audio that you _do_ wish to share in its original format regardless of the Settings — for example, if you want to save the recording to Dropbox for someone else to edit, and don’t mind the larger file size — you can. After you tap Share, look for the “Original File” option. When you tap this, the Share panel will briefly close and reopen: now select the service you want to export to, and the original file will be shared, unaltered.\n\n\n\n\n**Warning:** Remember that lossless audio can be much larger, use a lot of storage space, and if you’re sending the audio over a cellular connection, it may take a long time to share, and use a lot of mobile data. Be certain this is what you want!\n\n\n\r\n\n### Sharing Projects\n\n*   Exporting projects in Lossless or Wave format, as separate tracks (“stems”), as videos, or adjusting settings bitrates or mono conversion, are  only available to paying customers\r\n\nWhen you export a project, Ferrite will normally use Lossy AAC\/.M4A compression for the same reasons of space, time and bandwidth as before. In the \nSettings\n you can instead change your Sharing Format to Lossy (.MP3), Lossless (ALAC .CAF), and you can also pick Uncompressed Wave (PCM .WAV) format. Wave files are not compressed at all, and so they take up the most space. However, almost every other audio app will understand them, so they are popular for this reason despite their huge file sizes.\n\nWhen you select a sharing format in the Settings, you can also customise the options for it. For lossless formats, you can choose to automatically convert to mono on export by tapping the Mono\/Stereo indicator. For Lossy AAC\/.M4A compression, you can also pick a bitrate, and for .MP3 files you can either pick a Constant Bit Rate (CBR), or pick a Variable Bit Rate (VBR) quality. In most cases, you want to export in the highest quality possible, but if you’re creating a podcast or another file that lots of people are going to download, you might want to make a trade off, and share using a lower quality that’s smaller and faster to download.\n\nExporting a project using Lossless or Wave format can be particularly useful if you don’t want to upload the audio file immediately, but instead want to send it to another app for further processing first.\n\n\n\n\n**Note:** When exporting MP3s for podcasting production, we recommend the use of CBR files, as some podcast players get confused by VBR MP3 files.\n\n\n\r\n\n### Other Features in the Sharing Panel\n\n    Another way to share projects is to save them as videos — this can be useful for sharing to social networks. When you share a project, you will see a “Video” option in the sharing panel. If you tap this, Ferrite will create a video from your project, which you save to your Camera Roll or share. Note that Ferrite is not a video editor — it will use a still image for the video. If you have added cover art to your project, this will be used, otherwise the Ferrite icon will be used.\n\nThe Convert to Mono command can be used on both projects, and on stereo recordings. There are two different ways to do this, and Ferrite will ask you which you want:\n\n\n\nSplit to Separate Tracks\n\r\n\n\n\nThe left and right channels will be written to separate mono files. This is useful for interviews where the interviewer, and interviewee, are miked up separately and recorded to differt channels — you can split the recording, import the resulting audio into separate tracks, and edit them independently.\n\n\n\r\n\nMerge to One Mono Track\n\r\n\n\n\nThe left and right channels will be combined and written to a single mono file. This is useful if you’re going to be broadcasting in mono.\n\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\nYou can also share projects as separate tracks (commonly known as “stems”). You might do this if you wanted to finish editing on a desktop computer, for example. It creates a lossless .WAV file (for maximum quality &amp; compatibility) for each track, and packs them into a .zip file for sharing.\n\n## Long Recordings\n\nFerrite doesn’t have an upper limit on the duration of a recording (in the paid version — if you have not paid, you are limited to one hour per recording).\n\nOf course, your device is not infinite, and will eventually run out of space, and recording files can get very large, even with lossy compression.\n\nFerrite does not mind if recordings get very large, but other apps might, if you try to send large recordings to them. Therefore, Ferrite takes the following steps:\n\n*   If a recording gets above around 500MB in size, it is automatically split into parts. Each 500MB part is recorded into a separate file. The exact recording time this corresponds to, depends on your recording source (eg mono\/stereo), compression (lossy\/lossless) as well as the content of the audio. A lossless stereo recording can reach around 45-50 minutes before needing to start a second part. Mono recordings, or using lossy-compression, can extend the duration much further before this happens.\n*   Inside Ferrite, all the parts are still treated as a single audio clip in your library, joined together. It can still be edited as a single audio clip, and the parts will fit together seamlessly without any “cut”, “pop” or “click” where they join.\n*   The only difference within Ferrite itself is that a tiny “multi part recording” icon appears next to them in the Library, by the duration\/date information (right alongside where the bookmark icon appears).\n*   The files are split so that if you want to copy the files to your computer directly \nvia a USB\/Lightning cable\n, you can. iTunes sometimes refuses to copy very large files, so by keeping each piece below 500MB we hope to avoid this problem (obviously, we can’t guarantee the correct functioning of other apps, we can only make sure our own behaves as politely as possible!)\n*   When you share a recording (eg by email, sending to another app, iCloud, Dropbox), Ferrite will try joining the pieces.\r\n\nThe overall effect is that you shouldn’t need to worry about the size\/length of a recording, or how many parts it needs to be in — it should all just work, seamlessly — unless you need to share uncompressed audio with other apps.\n\n\n\n\n**Note:** In order to keep the app fast to use, Ferrite needs to do some “pre-processing” of a file before it can be edited. Normally this happens while the recording is being made, so there is no delay. But if you import an audio file from elsewhere, then this will happen when you first edit it. The larger the file, the longer this will take — on older devices, perhaps a second of processing per minute of audio. It’s much faster on modern devices.\n\nYou can still work with a project while this processing is happening, but the visuals for that file will be “blanked out” until it has finished.\n\nThis usually only needs to happen once per file, but if you lose your device and have to restore from a backup, the files will need to be re-processed (hopefully that isn’t something you have to worry about!)\n\n\n\r\n\n## Transferring Audio to a Computer\n\nAs well as using the built-in import and export commands, you can copy audio in and out of Ferrite by connecting your device to a computer and using Finder (on Apple Macs running macOS 10.15 “Catalina” or later) or iTunes (on PCs, or Macs running older versions of macOS). This can be useful if you have very large files to transfer, as it’s usually faster.\n\nYou do this using an Apple feature called App File Sharing. Apple [provide details on how to use it](http:\/\/service.wooji-juice.com\/common\/app-file-sharing.html) on their support site.\n\nThis Apple feature will show all the files from \nThe Library\n and you can copy them to your computer’s desktop. You can also copy new audio files in to Ferrite to use them in your projects.\n\n    Ferrite stores audio in special folders. This is so that it can save additional information alongside the audio file, such as your bookmarks. When you copy an audio file in to the Library, Ferrite will automatically move it into the right folder once it has finished copying.\n\nIf you want to copy an audio file back to the computer, you can, but you’ll need to copy the right folder. The folder will be named the same as the original audio file, but with an extension added. For example, “My Recording.wav” will be stored in a folder named “My Recording.wav.ferrite-audio”.\n\nWhen you copy this to a computer, you can open it up and you will find the original audio file (e.g. “My Recording.wav”) preserved safely inside. If you’re using an Apple Mac, you may find that the Finder treats the folder as a single file — if this happens, Ctrl+Click (or right-click) on it and pick “Show Package Contents”. This will open the folder so you can access the files inside.\n\n## Viewing History\n\nIf you have a project open and hold down the \n\nDone\n\n button in the toolbar, you will enter History. This lets you view earlier versions of your project — like a “Super Undo\/Redo”. When you enter History, the editing area floats away a little, and you can’t make changes to the project. You can still pan around, zoom in and out, undo and redo, move the Play Head around, and of course listen to your project.\n\nYou’ll also see the History Line. This represents the time you’ve been working on your project. You should see a highlighted circle with a date and time above it. This is the Current Version being shown in the editor. If you tap Undo or Redo, you’ll see it move back and forwards along the History Line, and the date and time updates to reflect when that version was made. You can also drag the Current Version marker, or tap anywhere in the History Line to jump straight to the nearest version.\n\nFor example, if you started your project last week, made some changes today, but aren’t sure if you like the new version or the old version better? Enter History, drag the Current Version marker until it shows last week’s date, and tap Play to listen to the older version. Jump back and forward comparing them, and decide which you prefer.\n\nWhen you’re finished with History, just tap the Done button again and everything will be restored to normal. If you do this while an old version is selected, it will ask you if you want to go back to the most recent version (your latest changes), or if you want to Undo all the way back to the version you’ve selected.\n\n\n\n\n**Warning:** Remember that if you Undo, then make changes, your new changes overwrite the old ones, so you can no longer Redo to get them back. With regular Undo\/Redo, this is pretty much always what you want. With History’s “Super Undo”, you should be more careful as you could lose quite a bit of work this way. It’s safe to look through History as much as you like, but you should only “Super Undo” if you’re sure you don’t want to keep the changes you’ve made since then.\n\n\n\r\n\n\n\n**Tip:** You can make a copy of a project by selecting it in the Library, tapping the \n\nShare\n\n button, then picking \n\nDuplicate\n\n. Since projects never change the original audio recordings they use, it doesn’t need to copy them, only the project itself, so this is fast and doesn’t take up much space.\n\nThe duplicate retains the entire History of the project, up to the point where you made the copy. After that point, they are now independent and you can edit or undo\/redo changes to one, without affecting the other. This is another good way to try out changes that you’re not sure about.\n\n\n\r\n\n## Archives\n\n*   Project archives are only available to paying customers\r\n\nWhen you’ve finished your project and exported it as an audio file, what then? You can leave the project (and the audio files it uses) in your Library, but eventually you may want to reclaim the storage space they take up. On the other hand, if you delete them, it will make it difficult, if not impossible, to make new versions of your project later.\n\nThis is where Archiving comes in. Ferrite can create an Archive: a “.zip” file that contains a project and all of the audio files it uses. You can move this archive off your device — perhaps \nonto a desktop computer\n, or saving it to a cloud storage service like Dropbox. Once the Archive is safely backed up somewhere, you can delete the files from your device, and get your storage space back.\n\nThen, if you ever do need to make a new version of the project in future, you can simply import the Archive back into Ferrite (using iTunes App File Sharing, or Ferrite’s Import Audio command) and unpack it. This will restore the audio files, and the project (including its full \nediting history\n) for you to edit.\n\nTo make an Archive, tap on a project, tap \n\nShare\n\n, then tap the \n\nMake Archive\n\n icon in the sharing panel. Ferrite will take the project, and all of the audio files it uses, and pack them into a single Archive file which will then appear in your Library.\n\n    You can select it like any other item in your Library. Unlike an audio clip or project, you can’t listen to it or edit it, but you can get info about it, share it, or delete it, as you would for any other Library item. Instead of an \n\nEdit\n\n button, there’s a button to \n\nUnpack Archive\n\n, restoring the contents to your Library.\n\nIf you open the \n\nInfo\n\n panel for an Archive, it will list the contents. You can select and unpack individual items, for example, if you only want to restore one audio clip from an Archive.\n\n\n\n\n**Note:** Archive files can be very large. Although the Archives are compressed (losslessly), because Ferrite already compresses audio, they will typically still take up about the same amount of space as the originals. So you will need at least that much space free to make an Archive — making it better not to wait until your device is full before making Archives out of old projects!\n\nFor safety, we recommend checking to make sure your Archives have been backed up securely to another location before you delete your files or Archives from your device.\n\n\n\r\n\n### Quickly Sharing Archives\n\nAs a shortcut, if you have a project on one device and want to send it to another — as a project, not an audio file — you can use the \n\nShare Archive\n\n command. This will make a temporary archive of the selected project, re-open the sharing panel so you can share it, then remove the temporary archive (your project is not affected).\n\n## Templates\n\n*   Project Templates are only available to customers who have purchased the Ferrite 2 Pro upgrade\r\n\nIf you produce a podcast, or something else where you regularly create projects that are part of a series, season, or show with a particular format, Project Templates can save you time.\n\nIf you create a template for that show, then when you’re ready to make a new episode, a single tap will make the project for you automatically, set up just the way you want it. You can also store \nPresets\n in a template, for convenient access while editing projects made from that template.\n\nA template is similar to a project. In fact, you start by making an example project to show Ferrite what it should look like, then convert it into a template. To convert a project into a template, open the \n\nProject Info\n\n panel for it, tap the \n\nTools\n\n button in the top-left corner of the panel, and pick \n\nMake Template\n\n.\n\nAlternatively, select the project, tap the \n\nShare\n\n button, then tap \n\nMake Template\n\n in the Share Sheet.\n\nUsually, you would want your templates to contain only the elements that are constant from episode to episode — the theme tune, for example, along with the settings like the cover art, author, copyright notices, etc. You can edit templates after you create them, so a good way to start is to take the most recent episode of your show, make a template from it, open the template up (by selecting it and using the \n\nEdit\n\n button, same as you would for a project), then delete anything you won’t be reusing.\n\nNext, open up the \n\nTemplate Info\n\n editing panel. This is similar to the Project Info panel, but with some extra features.\n\nThe Template Title at the top of the page is the name used for the template when it’s shown in the Library, but all the other info will be used to fill in the details of a new project, when you create one from this template.\n\n### Creating New Episodes\n\nWhen you look at a template in the Library, in place of the \n\nPlay\n\n button you’ll instead find a \n\nNew Episode\n\n button. Tap this to create a new episode from that template. It will contain any tracks, audio, automation, effects, chapters and other settings stored in the template.\n\n    You can also have audio files inserted into a project when you create it: tap the \n\nSelect\n\n button first, then select the audio files you want to insert, then tap the \n\nNew Episode\n\n button.\n\nThe audio files you selected will be inserted into the project in the order that you selected them. Each audio file is placed on a separate track. If your template contained blank tracks, these will be used. If there aren’t any blank tracks (or they run out), new tracks will be created, until you reach the track limit for the project. Additional audio files beyond this point will be ignored.\n\n\n\n\n**Note:** For a track to be considered “blank”, it mustn’t have any audio clips on it. But it _can_ have effects or automation applied, so you can build templates with your tracks set up the way you want them, and have audio dropped straight in to them when you create a new episode.\n\n\n\r\n\n### Placeholders\n\nIn the Template Info panel, when you edit the episode title, subtitle, filename, link, copyright notice or notes, you can fill in Placeholders. These are markers that indicate where different information will be filled in later for each episode — for example the episode number or the air date.\n\nWhen you create a template from a project, Ferrite will look at the title of the original project, and try to spot the episode number and date, if present, and put Placeholders there for you automatically. If it guesses wrong, you can add, remove or change Placeholders to customise them to your taste.\n\nYou should see buttons for them at the top of the on-screen keyboard (or the bottom of the screen, if you have a hardware keyboard connected). Tap these to add a Placeholder at the cursor. The Placeholder shows what type it is, then an example of the text that will be filled in. This example will be replaced by the real episode number, air date or other info when you create each episode.\n\nYou can tap on the Placeholder to change which type it is. If you tap on the example text, you can change the way it will be presented (for example, the format of the date, the number of digits in the episode number, or whether other text is converted to upper or lower case, or left alone). You can delete Placeholders the same way you would delete any other text in the text field.\n\nWhen you create a new project (episode) from the template, it will ask you to fill in the information used by the Placeholders. It will only ask you for information that’s actually used, and it will only ask you once no matter how many times the info is used in the template. Depending on how you format your episodes, this means you may be able to fill out most episode info automatically.\n\nThere are three Custom Placeholders — these are short pieces of text you can use for anything you like. For example, if you produce an interview show, you might decide to use one of the Custom Placeholders for the guest’s name, and then fill it into the title, show notes, etc. You can also paste in the contents of the clipboard, if it contains text when the episode is created (otherwise, the Clipboard placeholder will be skipped).\n\n## Presets\n\n*   Presets are only available to customers who have purchased the Ferrite 2 Pro upgrade\r\n\nPresets allow you to save the settings for various Ferrite features, such as \nDucking\n, \nStrip Silence\n, \nTighten Audio\n, \nEffects\n and \nMP3 Chapters\n.\n\nYou can create multiple presets for each feature and give them names, then load them back in later for quick re-use.\n\nEach of these features has a \n\nFolder\n\n button — tap this to open the Presets browser for that feature. This lists the available presets, and an \n\n+\n Add\n button to save a new preset.\n\nYou’ll be prompted for a name for the preset. If you’re signed in to iCloud and Ferrite has permission to access it, you can also choose to save the preset to iCloud Drive so that it will be available on other devices.\n\nOr, if you’re editing a project that was \ncreated from a Template\n, you can instead choose to save the preset into the Template.\n\nIf you do this, the preset will only appear in other projects created from the same Template, and will be shown at the top of the list for quick access — handy for chapters used in a particular podcast, or effects you always use in a particular show.\n\nTo remove a preset you no longer want, swipe across it from right-to-left to reveal the \n\nDelete\n\n button. This also reveals a \n\nFolder\n\n button which allows you to rename a preset, or move it (e.g. from inside a Template to On My iPad).\n\n\n\n\n**Note:** Ferrite supports “plug-in” effects in the form of \nAudio Unit Extensions\n (AUX). Ferrite&nbsp;2&nbsp;Pro can save presets for AUX effects, providing they support it — AUX effects are not part of Ferrite, and some AUX effects might only support built-in presets that are part of the effect itself, or may ignore custom presets.\n\n\n\r\n\n## Tagging\n\nTagging is a way to organise your Library. It works by attaching one or more “tags” to recordings, imported audio or projects. Tags are just short text labels — the text can be whatever you like (including emoji!). When you want to find something again, you can ask Ferrite to hide everything in the Library that _doesn’t_ match certain tags. How you use this feature is up to you, but some suggestions:\n\n*   You could tag audio according to what kind of content it is: music, interviews, voice-overs, adverts, special effects\n*   You could tag audio and projects according to the project they belong to, for example, a particular radio show or podcast, or specific episodes\n*   You could tag recordings with the names of people who appear in them\n*   You could tag items with their status, such as “work in progress”, “finished”, “broadcast”\n*   You could tag different “takes” of a recording with which ones you like the most or least.\r\n\nYou can associate more than one tag with an item, and you can search for more than one tag at a time — this will only show items with _all_ the tags. So you can quickly find (for example), all the interviews, that have been finished, featuring Alice and Bob.\n\nWhenever you are viewing the info for an item in the Library, there will be a section for editing tags. First, it will list the tags that apply to the item (if any). Simply tap one to remove it from the item.\n\nNext, there is a space for you to type in new tags. If you have a lot of tags, you can also use this to locate a tag quickly — as you start to type, it will only show tags matching what you’ve typed so far. When you tap the Return key on the keyboard, the tag will be attached to the item (unless the item already had that tag, in which case it will be removed).\n\nFinally, there will be a list of all the tags that are not currently attached to the item, but are used on other items in your Library. You can simply tap one to also apply it to this item.\n\nSearching for items using tags is easy: in the \n\nSearch\n\n box at the top of the Library, tap the \n\nTag\n\n button (it’s only shown when you have applied tags to items) and it will show all the tags used anywhere in your library. Tap a tag to add\/remove it from the search list. Items will only be shown in the library if they have those tags attached.\n\n### Colours\n\n*   Assigning colours to tags is  only available to paying customers\r\n\n    You can also assign colours to tags in the \nSettings\n. The “Tags &amp; Colours” section shows a list of all the tags, with a colour next to each one, or a dotted empty circle if no colour is assigned. Hold your finger on the circle\/colour to pop open the colour selector, then drag to adjust. Or, with the colours open, slide your finger to the right to remove the colour from that tag.\n\nYou can also tap the Edit button to change the order of tags: since an item can have many tags assigned to it, sometimes Ferrite has to choose which colours are the most important, and it uses this list to decide — you can move important items up, and unimportant ones down.\n\nYou can also set where the tag’s colours are shown: in the Library, during editing, or both. If enabled, then:\n\n*   In the Library, the four most important colours will be used, shown as stripes down the left-hand edge of the item.\n*   While editing, the most important colour is used to tint the audio clip.\r\n\n## Drag And Drop\n\n\n\n\n**Note:** Due to iOS limitations, system-wide Drag and Drop is currently only available on iPad.\n\n\n\r\n\nYou’ve always been able to move audio clips around inside your projects using Drag and Drop, and still can. But since iOS 11, Drag and Drop was expanded across the system, allowing you to drag many kinds of things, not just within an app, but from one app to another. Ferrite Drag and Drop features include:\n\n### Library (Drop)\n\n*   You can drop files — audio, project archives, etc — into the Library to import them into Ferrite. If you drop several at once, they will all be selected, ready to create a new project from them.\n*   You can drop an image onto a project to set it as cover art.\r\n\n### Library (Drag)\n\n*   All types of Library item — audio, projects and archives — can be dragged out to another app, to save\/export them there.\n*   Archives are always copied as .zip files.\n*   In the free version of Ferrite (or if you haven’t changed the settings) audio and projects are copied as Lossy (AAC .m4a) files.\n*   In the paid version of Ferrite, audio and projects are copied using the \nsharing format\n you have selected in the Settings, as long as the app you’re dropping it in accepts that format. Otherwise, Ferrite will use the highest-quality format accepted by the destination app.\r\n\n### Project Editing\n\n*   You can drop audio into the project editing area to simultaneously import it into your Ferrite Library and insert it into the project.\n*   If you tap Import to show the Audio Library, you can also drag audio from the Library straight into the editing area.\n*   Drop audio into a track to insert it at a particular spot on that track. If you dragged multiple files, they will be inserted one after another.\n*   Drop audio into the area below the tracks to create a new track for the audio. If you dragged multiple files, they will either get a track each, or they can be pushed together onto one track, by dragging them close to the existing tracks.\n*   You can drop a project into another project (but not into itself). Whenever you do this, the dragged project is “bounced” to a new audio file in your Library (in your chosen Sharing Format), and that audio file will be included in the target project.\r\n\n### Project Info\n\n*   You can drop text, links and images into the appropriate sections of the Project Info view.\r\n\n### MP3 Chapters\n\n*   You can create a new chapter — or update an existing one — by dropping text, links or images onto the Time Bar along the top of the screen.\n*   You can also update a chapter in the Chapter List by dropping text, links or images onto it.\n*   You can also drop text, links or images into the appropriate sections of the Chapter Details view.\r\n\n## Accessibility: VoiceOver\n\n\n\n\n**Note:** Accessibility features have changed in Ferrite&nbsp;2. Navigating around tracks should now be faster and easier.\n\n\n\r\n\nFerrite has extensive support for VoiceOver, Apple’s technology for asssisting users by speaking the screen contents out loud.\n\nMuch of the application, including the Library, recording, importing, exporting, project info and audio info screens, work pretty much the same way as the non-VoiceOver interface, but using the standard VoiceOver gestures to navigate, activate and cancel but with the same structure and features.\n\nA small change in the Library is that audio, projects etc. do not use the toolbar when VoiceOver is active. Instead, after selecting an item, you can swipe up or down to pick a toolbar command (Edit, Info, Share, Delete), then double-tap to activate it.\n\nThe Editing screen is the most complex part of the application, and this is where the majority of the differences are in the VoiceOver interface. The same screen elements are used, but with VoiceOver adaptations. Here’s a list of the elements you’ll find in the VoiceOver interface, in the order they appear, along with how they have been adapted:\n\n1.  The Ruler: Speaks the time range that is currently on-screen. Swiping up or down zooms the time range in or out. When you adjust other elements (e.g. the Play Head, or moving, fading or cropping audio clips), the rate of adjustment depends on the zoom level: the more zoomed you are, the finer control you will have, while if you are zoomed out, then you can make larger changes more quickly.\n2.  The Play Head: Speaks the current time where playback will resume. With VoiceOver, this is also used as the time at which many editing commands are carried out. Swiping up or down adjusts the time. Double-tap to jump to a specific time by dialing in the hours, minutes, seconds and hundredths of a second.\n3.  The Selection (optional): If you have any audio clips selected, then the next item represents the selection as a whole. Double tap to open the standard selection menu with Cut, Copy, Delete etc. Or swipe up or down to select additional commands, allowing you to move the selection earlier or later in the timeline, or clear (deselect) the selection.\n4.  Next, each track is listed in turn. If you have automation tracks, they will also be in this list, placed after the audio track they belong to.\n5.  Audio Tracks speak their position in the list, the number of clips that are currently on-screen, and the total number of clips on that audio track. They also mention if they are soloed or muted. Audio Tracks can have a lot of items on them, so you can use the “Tracks” Rotor to skip directly to the start of each track.\n6.  Audio Track Items:\n7.  The Track Tools button: Opens the \nstandard menu of commands\n for the track.\n8.  Volume and Pan controls: These can be adjusted by swiping up or down. They will not be available if they have been automated — in this case, use the Automation Track to control them instead.\n9.  Edit Point: Opens a menu of commands that apply to this track at the Play Head position, for example, splitting an audio clip into two parts. The commands available depend on context, for example, if the Play Head is not positioned inside an audio clip, you won’t be able to split.\n10.  Audio Clips: The rest of the track consists of the Audio Clips contained within the screen range, as described by the ruler. Double tap to add or remove a clip from the selection. Swipe up or down to choose a command to apply to the clip. Most commands require the clip to be selected first. Audio Clip editing is described in more detail below.\r\n\nAutomation Tracks: Automation Tracks speak the track and parameter they control, along with the number of \nControl Points\n currently on-screen. Next, there will be an item to insert a new Control Point into the track. This creates a new Control Point at the Play Head position, so it only appears if the Play Head is on-screen and not already pointing at a Control Point. Finally, there will be the on-screen control points.\r\n\nSwiping up or down adjusts the Control Point’s value. Double-tap, and instead, swiping up and down will select different commands. You can delete the Point (as long as it isn’t the last one on the track — a track must always have at least one Control Point), return to editing its value, or edit its time, swiping to nudge it along the timeline.\n\n\r\n\nFinal Mix: Placed below all the audio tracks. Double-tap to open the \nFinal Mix\n menu. Final Mix Automation tracks will be placed after it, these work the same way as other automation tracks. If you’re editing a \ntemplate\n this menu will be renamed Template to match, but it works the same way.\n\r\n\nAt the end are the standard button commands: Add New Track, Import Audio, and the toolbar buttons.\n\r\n\n\r\n\n### Editing Audio Clips with VoiceOver\n\nWhen you have an audio clip selected, and focused by VoiceOver, you can swipe up or down to select an action: Move, Crop Start, Crop End, Fade In, Fade Out, and Menu.\n\nDouble-tap to activate a command. In the case of Menu, this opens the regular editing menu. The others are special.\n\nWhen you select Move, Crop Start, Crop End, Fade In, or Fade Out, they will also speak the relevant information: the duration of the fade in or out, the amount of cropping applied to the beginning or end, or the position of the clip on the timeline. Double-tap to put the clip into the selected editing mode. Double-tap again to return to the list of commands. When an editing mode is selected, swipe up or down to adjust the amount of cropping or fading, or to move the selection.\n\n### Input Level Monitoring with VoiceOver\n\nYou can enable audio feedback on the current recording levels, providing you have headphones connected (otherwise the feedback could itself be picked up by the microphone). Activate the input source (e.g. iPad Microphone) to toggle this feature on or off.\n\nWhen enabled, if your recording level is too high and the recording gets clipped, a half-second chime will sound at 880hz (an A in octave 5). For other levels, short tones will sound in different octaves, representing different decibel ranges: -3dB to 0dB is 440hz, -6dB to -3dB is 220hz, -9dB to -6dB is 110hz. Below that, no tone is sounded. The feedback only plays when the level crosses the threshold, not continuously. You can also use up\/down swipe gestures to select Clipping Only mode, which only plays feedback when audio clips, not when other thresholds are crossed. And of course, you can simply enable headphone monitoring and listen to the audio yourself if you prefer!\n\n### Other VoiceOver Editing Features\n\nYou can use the “Magic Tap” gesture (a two-finger double-tap) to start or stop playback.\n\nYou can also use the “On Pause:” Custom Rotor to change what happens when you stop playback. The default mode, “Stop”, simply stops playback as you would expect. The other mode, “Rewind” will reset the Play Head to the position it was at, before you started playing audio. This can be useful if you started playback so you could hear where the Play Head was positioned, and want it to go back there.\n\n    If you have a Bluetooth keyboard attached, you can also use the \n⌥ alt\n \nSpace Bar\n shortcut to pause-and-rewind. More on keyboard shortcuts is available in the chapter \nShortcuts, Gestures and Keyboard Commands\n.\n\n### VoiceOver Settings\n\nYou can slightly customise the way Ferrite speaks times and durations. Normally, it adjusts the amount of detail according to the zoom level, to match the amount of detail you can edit at that zoom level. For example, when zoomed out to a range of one hour, it doesn’t normally bother announcing the number of seconds and milliseconds. However, if you prefer to always have times spoken in full, you can enable this in the Settings. Then, Ferrite will read down to the millisecond level regardless of zoom. It will still skip unnecessary parts, for example, if your project is only 15 minutes long, it will not prefix every timestamp with “zero hours”, or if you line something up exactly at the start of a minute, it will not speak “zero seconds zero milliseconds”.\n\n## Shortcuts, Gestures and Keyboard Commands\n\nFerrite is optimised for multitouch control (and you can enable and customise \nadditional editing gestures\n too), but you can also enable an on-screen \nShortcut Bar\n that provides quick access to editing commands.\n\nIf you have an external keyboard connected, many commands are also available as keyboard shortcuts.\n\n\n\n\n**Note:** These are the default keyboard shortcuts. If you are using a paid version of Ferrite, you can pick alternative schemes — these are designed to be familiar to users of popular desktop audio editing apps, where possible (other apps may not support the same features as Ferrite, or their keys may not be available on all keyboards, so these schemes are approximations).\n\nYou can also customise a scheme by tapping a command in the list, then pressing the key combination you want to use. Some key combinations are reserved by iOS for its own use, so you may not be able to use them.\n\nTo change or customise the scheme, or see a complete list of the keys for each scheme, visit the \nSettings\n and pick “Keyboard Shortcuts”.\n\n\n\r\n\n### Library\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n↑\n &nbsp; \n↓\n\n\n\n\nSelect previous\/next item in the Library\n\n\n\n\r\n\n\n\n⌘ cmd\n \nA\n\n\n\n\nShow All items in the Library, if some have been hidden\n\n\n\n\r\n\n\n\n⌘ cmd\n \nDelete\n\n\n\n\nDelete the selected item\n\n\n\n\r\n\n\n\n⌘ cmd\n \nE\n\n\n\n\nShare (Export) the selected item\n\n\n\n\r\n\n\n\n⌘ cmd\n \nF\n\n\n\n\nSelect the Search text box (Find)\n\n\n\n\r\n\n\n\n⌘ cmd\n \n⌥ alt\n \nF\n\n\n\n\nShow the Filter menu\n\n\n\n\r\n\n\n\n⌘ cmd\n \nI\n\n\n\n\nShow Info for the selected item\n\n\n\n\r\n\n\n\n⌘ cmd\n \n⌥ alt\n \nI\n\n\n\n\nImport Audio\n\n\n\n\r\n\n\n\n⌘ cmd\n \nN\n\n\n\n\nCreate a new episode from a Template\n\n\n\n\r\n\n\n\n⌘ cmd\n \nO\n\n\n\n\nEdit (Open) the selected item\n\n\n\n\r\n\n\n\n⌘ cmd\n \nR\n\n\n\n\nStart\/stop recording\n\n\n\n\r\n\n\n\n⌘ cmd\n \nS\n\n\n\n\nEnter\/leave Select mode\n\n\n\n\r\n\n\n\n⌘ cmd\n \nT\n\n\n\n\nShow the Tools Menu\n\n\n\n\r\n\n\n\n⌘ cmd\n \nU\n\n\n\n\nUnpack a selected archive\n\n\n\n\r\n\n\n\n\r\n\n### Navigating Projects\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n←\n  \n\n→\n\n\n\n\nRewind\/Fast Forward a short distance — the amount depends on how zoomed in you are\n\n\n\n\r\n\n\n\n⌥ alt\n \n←\n  \n\n⌥ alt\n \n→\n\n\n\n\nStep the Play Head backwards\/forwards by the smallest amount visible (for the current zoom)\n\n\n\n\r\n\n\n\n⌘ cmd\n \n←\n  \n\n⌘ cmd\n \n→\n\n\n\n\nJump the Play Head backwards\/forwards to the next audio clip or bookmark, the same as the Rewind\/Fast Forward buttons on the toolbar\n\n\n\n\r\n\n\n\n⌘ cmd\n \n⌥ alt\n \n←\n  \n\n⌘ cmd\n \n⌥ alt\n \n→\n\n\n\n\nJump the Play Head to the beginning or end of the project\n\n\n\n\r\n\n\n\n⌘ cmd\n \nJ\n\n\n\n\nJump the Play Head to a specific time\n\n\n\n\r\n\n\n\nEnter\n\n\n\n\nZoom in on the selection\n\n\n\n\r\n\n\n\n⌘ cmd\n \nEnter\n\n\n\n\nZoom out to the project’s duration\n\n\n\n\r\n\n\n\n+\n\n\n\n\nZoom in on the Play Head by one step\n\n\n\n\r\n\n\n\n−\n\n\n\n\nZoom out from the Play Head by one step\n\n\n\n\r\n\n\n\nTab\n\n\n\n\nJump to the Play Head\n\n\n\n\r\n\n\n\nSpace\n  \n\n⌥ alt\n \nSpace\n\n\n\n\nPlay\/pause\n\nHolding Alt when pausing will return the Play Head to its previous position\n\n\n\n\r\n\n\n\n\r\n\n### Editing Projects\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n⌘ cmd\n \nS\n\n\n\n\nClose the project and return to the Library\n\n\n\n\r\n\n\n\n⌘ cmd\n \nI\n\n\n\n\nPop open the Library to import audio into the project\n\n\n\n\r\n\n\n\n⌘ cmd\n \nZ\n  \n\n⌘ cmd\n \n⇧ shift\n \nZ\n\n\n\n\nUndo\/Redo\n\n\n\n\r\n\n\n\n⌘ cmd\n \n⌥ alt\n \nZ\n\n\n\n\nEnter\/Leave History\n\n\n\n\r\n\n\n\n⌘ cmd\n \nA\n\n\n\n\nSelect All audio clips\n\n\n\n\r\n\n\n\n⌘ cmd\n \nD\n\n\n\n\nDeselect All audio clips\n\n\n\n\r\n\n\n\n⌘ cmd\n \nF\n\n\n\n\nSelect All audio clips following the currently-selected one, on all tracks\n\n\n\n\r\n\n\n\n⌘ cmd\n \n⌥ alt\n \nF\n\n\n\n\nSelect All audio clips following the currently-selected one, same track only\n\n\n\n\r\n\n\n\n\\\n\n\n\n\nToggle automation nodes in or out of the selection\n\n\n\n\r\n\n\n\n⌘ cmd\n \nT\n\n\n\n\nSplit the selected audio clips at the Play Head position\n\n\n\n\r\n\n\n\n⌘ cmd\n \nX\n\n\n\n\nCut the selection to the pasteboard\n\n\n\n\r\n\n\n\n⌘ cmd\n \nC\n\n\n\n\nCopy the selection to the pasteboard\n\n\n\n\r\n\n\n\n\/\n\n\n\n\nMove the selection to start at the Play Head position\n\n\n\n\r\n\n\n\n⇧ shift\n \n←\n  \n\n⇧ shift\n \n→\n\n\n\n\nMove the selected audio clips a short distance\n\n\n\n\r\n\n\n\n⇧ shift\n \n⌥ alt\n \n←\n  \n\n⇧ shift\n \n⌥ alt\n \n→\n\n\n\n\nMove the selected audio clips by the smallest amount visible (for the current zoom)\n\n\n\n\r\n\n\n\n[\n &nbsp; \n]\n\n\n\n\nCrop the beginning (\n[\n) or end (\n]\n) of the selected audio to the Play Head.

These commands are all available in other ways, so the Shortcut Bar is switched off by default, but you can enable it from the \nSettings\n, or by tapping the Time Display and enabling it from the pop-up menu there.\n\nFrom the Time Display options menu, you can also customise the Shortcut Bar. This opens a panel containing all the Shortcut Bar commands, and you can drag the ones you want into the Shortcut Bar, or drag ones you don’t want out of the bar. The bar has three areas you can drop commands onto, allowing you to group commands on the left, in the centre, or on the right, in the order you prefer.\n\n### Editing Gestures\n\nIf you like, you can enable some shortcut gestures in the \nSettings\n to speed up editing, based around using two fingers at a time on the screen. When enabled, you can:\n\n\n\nTap with Two Fingers\n\r\n\n\n\nYou can choose what this does:\n\n*   Start playing\/pause playback\n*   Zoom in to selection\/zoom out to entire project\r\n\n\r\n\nDrag from Left to Right with Two Fingers\n\r\n\n\n\nDrag out a selection range. All the audio clips inside the range will be selected. The selection isn’t emptied first, so you can repeat the gesture to add more clips from another location. Or tap on the background first to clear the selection, if that’s what you need.\n\n\n\r\n\nDrag from Right to Left with Two Fingers\n\r\n\n\n\nDrag out a selection range to be immediately deleted. After the audio clips inside the range are removed, you’ll be given the chance to \nRipple the delete\n as usual (unless you’ve disabled Ripple in the \nSettings\n.\n\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\nIf you forget the gestures, just place two fingers on the screen. A circular pop-up menu will appear, centred on your fingers — as you slide your fingers left or right, Select or Delete mode will be activated as you pass over the appropriate icon, and you can just keep on sliding your fingers to drag out the time range.\n\nIn all cases, your fingers need to be fairly close together and move together — at least at first — so that you don’t zoom in or out instead.\n\n### Audio Snapping Selections\n\n    If you two-finger drag to select or delete, but the entire range is inside one audio clip, Ferrite will “snap” your selection to the edges of the sound. So for example, if you drag across a sentence, it will “shrink to fit” neatly around the sentence, cut the audio at both edges, and select or delete that sentence. Drag inside the sentence, and it will expand to select all of it. To avoid confusion, the amount of detail Ferrite will consider when snapping, depends on how zoomed in you are — it will ignore gaps in the sound too small for you to see, so you can use the zoom level to control the behaviour.\n\n### Apple Pencil™\n\nIf you have an Apple Pencil paired with your device, you can use it for editing. Normally, the Pencil is treated exactly the same as a finger, so you can use Pencil or fingers and switch between them as you wish.\n\n    Ferrite also has a custom Pencil Editing mode — you can find this in the Gestures &amp; Pencil section of the \nSettings\n. When you switch this on, the Pencil is used for editing — slicing, moving, cropping and fading audio — while fingers are used for zooming in and out, and moving your viewpoint around the project.\n\n\n\n\n**Note:** This setting only affects how audio clip editing and automation editing work. It does not affect other aspects of the user interface, such as buttons, dials, and lists — you can still use your fingers and your Pencil interchangeably outside of the audio editing area.\n\nIf your Pencil becomes unpaired, or if you haven’t used it recently, Ferrite will temporarily ignore this setting, allowing you to use fingers to edit as normal. The next time you tap the screen with the Pencil, your Pencil preferences are automatically restored.\n\n\n\r\n\nWith Pencil Editing on, you can also enable some gestures that can help speed up editing. These work similarly to the \nTwo Finger Editing Gestures\n: you can enable swiping across audio with the Pencil to select or delete multiple clips, or to pick out time ranges within a clip. Because the Pencil is much more precise than using two fingers on the screen, edits using the Pencil don’t snap to audio, they slice exactly where you place the pencil tip.\n\nIf you only enable one of the gestures, it doesn’t matter which direction you swipe, your chosen action will be performed.\n\nIf you enable both Select and Delete gestures, you swipe from left-to-right to select things, and swipe from right-to-left to delete things.\n\n#### Apple Pencil Double-Tap\n\nNewer models of Apple Pencil support double-tapping on the side of the pencil to trigger a shortcut. If you have one of these Pencils, and have enabled the gesture in the system settings, you can set the action you want Ferrite to perform:\n\n\n\nZoom\n\r\n\n\n\nToggles between zooming in to the current selection, or zooming out to the entire document.\n\n\n\r\n\nPlay \/ Pause\n\r\n\n\n\nStarts or stops playback.\n\n\n\r\n\nPencil \/ Finger\n\r\n\n\n\nToggles Pencil Editing on or off — in other words, switches between the Pencil using the special Pencil-editing gestures, or behaving the same way finger-touches do.\n\n\n\r\n\nCustom\n\r\n\n\n\nYou can pick any \nkeyboard shortcut\n\n\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\nYou can also switch this off if you don’t want Pencil double-taps to do anything in Ferrite.\n\n## Settings\n\n*   Settings marked \nPro\n are only available to customers who have purchased the Ferrite 2 Pro upgrade\r\n\nSome settings are only available if you are using iOS 13\/iPad OS 13 or later.\n\n### Recording Settings\n\n\n\nRecording Format\n\r\n\n\n\nSets how Ferrite stores the recordings you make. See the section on \nCompression and Sharing\n for more information about this.\n\n\n\r\n\nStopping Recording\n\r\n\n\n\nYou can choose how Ferrite behaves when you tap to stop recording. Normally, your recording is immediately added to the Library. You can choose instead for the recording to be paused. You can then continue recording by tapping the record button again, and repeat this as often as you like.\n\nEach time you continue, a Bookmark is added to the recording where you resumed. When your recording is finally complete, you can tap the “checkmark” (iOS 12) or “Save” (iOS 13) button to confirm that you’re done, and the recording is added to your Library.\n\n\n\r\n\nLarge Recording Level Control \nPro\n\n\r\n\n\n\nMost of the time, you want to set the input level before you start a recording, and leave it where it is for the duration. However, some people prefer to “ride the levels” — continuously adjust the input level during a recording, usually with headphones on to monitor the results. If this is how you roll, enabling this will add a large slider to the screen during recordings, for controlling the recording level. You can place it on either side of the screen. Note: if you’re recording through a device that doesn’t support input gain control, this slider will not appear.\n\n\n\r\n\nLayout (iPad Only) \nPro\n\n\r\n\n\n\nWhen you start a recording, the recording controls usually take over the whole screen (“Full Screen” mode). If you prefer, you can select “Compact” mode, which leaves the rest of the screen available for use. “Automatic” switches between Full Screen and Compact depending on which window you are in: the window that started the recording uses Full Screen mode, but if you open additional windows, they will use Compact mode.\n\n\n\r\n\nHeadphone Monitoring \nPro\n\n\r\n\n\n\nWhen using headphones to monitor during a recording, Ferrite normally reproduces stereo audio the same way it would be played back, with the left channel in the left ear, and the right channel in the right ear. For stereo recordings, this is what you want, but if you’re recording two mono mics (for example, one for the host, one for a guest), it can be distracting to have one voice in each ear.\n\nSelect “Mono” and when you monitor stereo recordings, they will be mixed down to mono before being sent to the headphones (the recording itself would still be stereo, unaffected by this setting). Select “Stereo (Reduced)” to play in stereo, but with the panning moved in towards the centre for a more natural sound, where you can still hear the stereo separation but it isn’t as extreme. Select “Stereo (Full)” to return to normal operation.\n\n\n\n\n**Tip:** You can quickly access this setting from the recording screen by holding down the headphones monitoring button.\n\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\nAllow Channels To Be Switched Off \nPro\n\n\r\n\n\n\nIf you want to be able to permanently omit channels from a recording, switch this on. See the \nPro Recording\n section for information on using this feature.\n\n\n\r\n\nCalibration \nPro\n\n\r\n\n\n\nThis changes the way the recording level meters work. In “Classic” mode, they display linear dB meters peaking at 0&nbsp;db. In “Non-Linear” mode, the display is adjusted slightly to provide more detail in the “sweet spot” between -﻿3&nbsp;dB and -﻿6&nbsp;dB.\n\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n### Editing Settings\n\n\n\nRipple Insert \/ Delete\n\r\n\n\n\nIf you never want Ferrite to ask you if you want to \nRipple Insert And Delete\n, you can switch off that feature here.\n\n\n\r\n\nOverlapping Audio\n\r\n\n\n\nWhen two pieces of audio are overlapped on a track, Ferrite will crossfade between them. If you prefer, you can change this so that Ferrite will crop the audio underneath, so that the piece you are moving “replaces” the audio you drop it onto.\n\n\n\r\n\nAfter Splitting Audio\n\r\n\n\n\nWhen you have audio selected, and split it in two (either using the menu or gesture), the pieces normally all stay selected. If you prefer, you can change this to clear the selection, or keep selected only the pieces before the split, or after the split. Depending on how you prefer to edit audio, this can speed up your editing.\n\n\n\n\n**Note:** Ferrite will do the crop in two steps, first moving and crossfading as normal, then applying the crop. In this way, if you mostly want to crop, but occasionally need a crossfade, you can simply tap Undo once after the crop to restore the fade. Also, if you have two pieces of audio that are already crossfaded, if you select them both and move them together, Ferrite will preserve the fade.\n\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\nAllow Volume to Go Over Maximum\n\r\n\n\n\nThe volume controls on tracks are normally limited to the range 0%&nbsp;→&nbsp;100% (-﻿∞&nbsp;dB&nbsp;→&nbsp;0&nbsp;dB), where the maximum is the original recorded audio at its loudest without clipping. If you enable this setting, you can “overdrive” the track gain, so you can make the audio louder than it originally was.\n\nHowever, where the audio was already at maximum volume, you’ll have now driven it past the maximum and this will be clipped. This can sound really bad, which is why the option is off by default. The “danger area” of the dial is marked in red; you can go right up to the edge of this area safely (the dial will “click into place” at the maximum safe level) without fear of clipping, but if you go into this area, you may clip.\n\nYou _can_ avoid the clipping if you’ve cut out the loud parts of the audio, or faded them, or applied some other effect to reduce the volume — so you can enable this setting if you know what you’re doing!\n\n\n\r\n\nAutomation\n\r\n\n\n\nOpens the panel for customising how automation is edited \ndescribed below\n\n\n\n\r\n\nShow Shortcut Bar\n\r\n\n\n\nLets you switch the customisable \nShortcut Bar\n on or off.\n\n\n\r\n\nKeyboard Shortcuts\n\r\n\n\n\nLets you view and edit the current set of \nKeyboard Shortcuts\n including searching, switching to alternate schemes, or customising your own scheme.\n\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n### Gestures, Pencil \n&amp;\n 3D Touch\n\n\n\nGestures (or Gestures and Pencil)\n\r\n\n\n\nOpens the panel for configuring gestures and (where supported) 3D Touch and Apple Pencil.\n\n\n\r\n\nTwo Finger Gestures\n\r\n\n\n\nThese optional shortcut gestures are described in the \nEditing Gestures\n section of the \nShortcuts, Gestures and Keyboard Commands\n chapter of the guide. Tap to configure the gestures you want to use.\n\n\n\r\n\n3D Touch\n\r\n\n\n\nOnly available on devices that support 3D Touch, these settings enable you to turn off some or all of Ferrite’s 3D Touch responses, if you find yourself triggering them by accident:\n\n\n\nUse to Prevent Snapping\n\r\n\n\n\nWhen dragging an audio clip, if Ferrite snaps your changes to a neighbouring clip, and you’re trying to make fine edits, you can press more firmly to disable this feature. It will stay disabled until you let go of the clip, or move it away from the position it’s snapping to. (On devices without 3D Touch, you can instead zoom in using the usual Pinch To Zoom gestures to get finer control).\n\n\n\r\n\nUse for Shortcuts\n\r\n\n\n\nIn various places in Ferrite there are buttons which have extra features if held down for a while. Usually the command is “the same, only more”. For example, tapping Rewind moves the Play Head back one clip, holding it moves the Play Head all the way to the start. With 3D Touch you can activate the secondary command by pressing the button firmly.\n\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\nPencil Editing\n\r\n\n\n\nOnly available when an Apple Pencil is paired, this allows you to switch \ncustom Apple Pencil support\n on or off, and customise additional Pencil editing gestures.\n\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n### Other Settings\n\n\n\nSharing Format \nPro\n\n\r\n\n\n\nThis sets how Ferrite shared audio with other apps. See the section on \nCompression and Sharing\n for more information about this.\n\n\n\r\n\nTags &amp; Colours \nPro\n\n\r\n\n\n\nAllows you to assign colours to tags, and control where those colours appear. See the \nTagging\n chapter for more details.\n\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n### Automation Settings \nPro\n\n\nHere, you can set whether \nAutomation\n uses continuous curves or straight lines.\n\nYou can also customise whether automation Control Points are included when you perform certain editing actions on the audio clips they’re lined up with:\n\n\n\nAutomatically Select\n\r\n\n\n\nControls whether automation gets included when you use commands like Select All On Track or Select All Following to select multiple pieces of audio at once. Note: this setting doesn’t affect what happens when you just tap on a single piece of audio to select it.\n\n\n\r\n\nDrag Select\/Delete With Audio\n\r\n\n\n\nControls whether automation gets included when you use either the \nApple Pencil™\n or \nTwo Finger Editing Gestures\n to select or delete audio clips, and then extend the drag across automation tracks as well.\n\n\n\n\n**Note:** Even when this is switched off, you can still drag to select\/delete automation, providing you start dragging from the automation track itself, instead of an audio track.\n\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\nInclude in Ripple Insert\/Delete\n\r\n\n\n\nControls whether automation gets moved when you Ripple an insert or delete on an audio track.\n\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\nAll these settings have three options:\n\n\n\nNever\n\r\n\n\n\nSwitches them off entirely.\n\n\n\r\n\nWhen Shown\n\r\n\n\n\nSwitches them on or off to match the current Show Automation setting.\n\n\n\r\n\nAlways\n\r\n\n\n\nAffects automation even when it’s hidden.\n\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n## Bluetooth\n\nWhen you pair Bluetooth speakers or headphones with your device, they can use several different methods to send audio back and forth. Some methods offer good audio quality, but don’t support microphone input. Others support microphone input, but are designed for telephone calls only, so the quality is poor.Ferrite is an app for _both_ recording _and_ playback, but since Bluetooth on iOS doesn’t support high-quality audio and microphone input at the same time, there are some things you need to be aware of if you want to use it.\n\n### Latency\n\nThe first thing to note is that there can be a small delay (“latency”) while your device converts the audio into a format that Bluetooth headphones\/speakers can understand, transmits it wirelessly to them, and then they decode it again. The amount of delay can depend on the kind of headphones\/speakers you are using, and applies to all audio, from any app on your device.\n\nWhen you’re just listening to music, it isn’t that noticeable since it’s typically just when you start\/stop listening that you might experience a small delay. But it can be more annoying while editing, because you are likely to be jumping around a lot and needing to make fine adjustments. Unfortunately this is another problem of the Bluetooth standard outside of our control.\n\nIf you wish to use Bluetooth anyway, please read on:\n\nAs long as your speakers\/headphones support the high-quality “A2DP” Bluetooth standard, you can use them with Ferrite **for listening only**. You don’t need to set any options in Ferrite, they should just work.\n\nYou won’t be able to record from them — even if they have a microphone. But you can record through another microphone, such as one connected via wires such as USB or Lightning.\n\n## Audio Unit Extensions\n\n\n\n\n**Note:** This feature requires a compatible device, and is still “experimental”. We’re releasing it so that the developers of Audio Unit Extensions can test their extensions for compatibility with Ferrite. If you find it useful, please go ahead and use it, but be aware that there are some known issues.\n\n\n\r\n\nOn compatible devices, when you open the Effects list, in either the Track menu or the Final Mix menu, you will see more than just the effects built in to Ferrite, you will also see “Audio Units” and “Audio Unit Extensions”.\n\nAudio Units are similar to the built-in effects, but they are supplied by iOS itself. Audio Unit Extensions are supplied by **other apps** on your device. When you install compatible apps, their Audio Unit Extensions will appear in the Effect list in Ferrite, extending its power. If you remove those apps, the Extensions will also be removed from Ferrite.\n\nBecause these other apps are not made by Wooji Juice and may not even have been written when Ferrite was released, we can’t guarantee compatibility. When you add one to a track or the Final Mix, then tap on it to open the controls, **the controls that appear are supplied by the Audio Unit Extension**, not Ferrite. You should check the app that the Extension came from (or the website of that app’s developer) for instructions on how to use them.\n\nAudio Unit Extensions mostly work the same way as built-in effects. You can add them to tracks and the Final Mix, adjust their settings, undo changes that you don’t like, and even automate their settings (providing the developer of the Audio Unit Extension hasn’t disabled this).\n\n\n\n\n**Known Issues with Audio Unit Extensions:**\n\n*   When you open an Audio Unit Extension’s settings panel and make changes, although you will hear the changes in the sound right away, those changes won’t get passed back to Ferrite until you tap Done. This means that the changes won’t be saved until that time, and Undo\/Redo will apply to all changes made while the panel was open. This is due to a limitation of the Audio Unit Extension system in iOS.\n*   For the same reason, you can’t live-record automation using the Audio Unit Extension’s own controls. You _can_ live-record automation using the dial supplied by Ferrite in the sidebar of the automation track, however.\n*   Changes made using automation may not show up in the Audio Unit Extension’s controls. This is due to a bug in the iOS Audio Unit Extension system which we hope Apple will fix.\n*   Some Audio Unit Extensions have presets. If you select a preset, you will hear the changes, but they may not show up in the controls. Again, this is due to a bug in the iOS Audio Unit Extension system. Preset changes should get saved, though, and support Undo\/Redo.\r\n\n\n\r\n\n## What’s New in Ferrite 2\n\nJust updated to Ferrite 2? Welcome! We’ve cleaned and polished lots of things, but you can find them in the same places as before, so you should feel right at home.\n\n\n\n\n**If you bought the Ferrite&nbsp;1 Pro upgrade, don’t worry — it still works with Ferrite&nbsp;2, with all the features you paid for.** If you’d like to upgrade to Ferrite&nbsp;2&nbsp;Pro, there are a bunch of new features: Multichannel Recording, Preproduction, Channels, Templates, the Equaliser, and improvements to Presets. Accessibility is also improved, and there are some other smaller improvements too.\n\n\n\r\n\n### New: Multichannel Recording\n\n**(Multichannel recording requires iOS 13 or later.)**\n\nFerrite 2.4 supports recording up to 8 channels at once. You can also switch off channels you don’t need, and change the way stereo and multichannel recordings are monitored through headphones.\n\n### New: Preproduction and Channels\n\nFerrite&nbsp;2 introduces a new suite of tools for getting audio ready before you start using it in a project. Preproduction can be found in the \nAudio Info\n panel for an audio file.\n\nPreproduction tools include:\n\n\n\nChannel Selection\n\r\n\n\n\nFerrite&nbsp;1 supported mono or stereo audio files. Ferrite&nbsp;2&nbsp;Pro can also read tracks with three or more channels. Since podcasts and radio are themselves still only mono or stereo, Ferrite will use up to two channels at a time. But you can now pick which ones, allowing you to switch off unwanted channels, swap left and right channels, and so on.\n\n\n\r\n\nChannel Splitting\n\r\n\n\n\nAdditional channels can be split out into new files, so if you have (for example) a 4-channel audio file, each representing a different person’s mic, you can use Channel Selection to pick the one to use for that Audio Library item, and split the other three out into new audio files, allowing all four to be independently edited in a project.\n\n\n\r\n\nAuto Levelling\n\r\n\n\n\nFerrite&nbsp;1 supported Auto Levelling of projects during export. In Ferrite&nbsp;2&nbsp;Pro this is also available in Preproduction, to smooth out a recording’s levels before you begin editing.\n\n\n\r\n\nNoise Reduction\n\r\n\n\n\nAutomatically analyses a recording to attempt to find and eliminate background noise. Not all noise can be removed, but background noise like the “hiss” commonly found in recordings can often be reduced.\n\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\nRead more about \nChannel Selection and Splitting\n or \nPreproduction\n\n\n### New: Templates\n\nProject Templates speed up your work by automating some repetitive tasks. When you’re working on a project that’s part of a podcast or regular series, you’ll often add the same theme tune, dial in the same settings, fill in the same project details, and so on. Templates take care of this for you.\n\nTemplates start with an example project — for example, the most recent episode of your podcast. You can then turn it into a Template, and remove any elements that don’t belong (e.g. the conversation from that podcast), keeping the stuff that’s consistent from episode to episode (cover art, theme tune, etc).\n\nYou can set up Placeholders, so that the title, show notes, links, etc can have the date, episode number and certain other details automatically filled in for each episode. With a tap on the Template, a new blank episode can be put together — with everything set up, ready to go. You can also optionally pick some audio files to be included in the new project.\n\n    \nRead more about Templates\n\n\n### Enhanced: Presets\n\nIn Ferrite&nbsp;1 Pro, you can save your preferred settings for tools like Strip Silence or Ducking into a library and recall them later. Ferrite&nbsp;2&nbsp;Pro adds several enhancements:\n\n*   Presets can be stored in Templates for easy access within any project made from that template.\n*   Or you can store Presets in iCloud, so they will sync between devices.\n*   Or if you store Presets on your device, they’ll now appear in the Documents folder in iTunes for easy backup.\n*   You can now rename your Presets, and move them from place to place (on your device, in iCloud, inside a Template).\n*   And more features now support Presets, including Chapters and many third-party Audio Unit Extension (AUX) effects.\r\n\n### New: Equaliser\n\nFerrite&nbsp;2&nbsp;Pro includes a new built-in effect, the Equaliser. This is a powerful multi-band (up to 8) fully customisable EQ unit, supporting visual editing, automation, and a live graphic visualiser during playback.\n\n    \nRead more about the Equaliser\n\n\n### Other Improvements\n\n\nProjects\n can now have an export filename. We can’t force other apps to use it, but Ferrite will suggest it when converting projects to audio files and sending them to other apps — it’s particularly useful if you’re sending a file to a cloud storage service, or uploading a finished episode to a podcast host for publication. If you don’t set the export filename, it defaults to the same as in Ferrite&nbsp;1: using the title of the project.\n\nYou can set the export filename for \nTemplates\n too, and they supports Placeholders, so the filename can be automatically updated with the episode number or air date of an episode.\n\nBoth Templates and Projects can also set a custom file format to use when sharing audio. If you don’t set this, it defaults to using the one in the \nSettings\n, so you only need to change it if you want a custom format per project, podcast, etc.\n\nIndividual \nMP3 Chapters\n can now be “hidden” — these are left out of the Table of Contents, but well-behaved podcast players will still display their artwork (and may caption it with the chapter title). Or, if you export your project as a video file, images from the chapter artwork will now be used there too. These tools allow you to create a slideshow to accompany your audio. Chapters can also be included in .WAV files (although this format only supports titles — not links, images or hidden chapters).\n\n### VoiceOver Enhancements\n\n\n\n\n**Note:** These VoiceOver enhancements are available to all VoiceOver users, whether or not they purchase the Ferrite&nbsp;2&nbsp;Pro upgrade.\n\n\n\r\n\nThe VoiceOver accessibility interface to Ferrite has been updated to take advantage of new iOS accessibility technologies that weren’t available when Ferrite&nbsp;1 was created. A track can contain many items, which could take a long time to navigate past. So, in Ferrite&nbsp;1, tracks could be “folded” or “unfolded” to hide or reveal their items. This allowed you to quickly skip past tracks, but could be confusing and introduce extra steps in the process.\n\nIn Ferrite&nbsp;2, tracks are always “unfolded” to reveal all of their items, but a new “Custom Rotor” allows you to skip from track to track with a single swipe. This should be faster to use as well as easier to understand and navigate.\n\nYou can also now change the behaviour when you pause playback, using another Custom Rotor, to choose whether or not to automatically rewind to where playback started.\n\n    \nRead more about VoiceOver Accessibility in Ferrite&nbsp;2\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n[𝗗𝗮𝘃𝗶𝗱 𝗕𝗹𝘂𝗲](https:\/\/davidblue.wtf\/db.vcf)\n\n\n\n\n","views":78,"updated":"2022-11-04T04:31:32Z","tags":[],"type":null,"title":"Ferrite User Guide","slug":"ferrite-user-guide","appearance":"sans","language":"","rtl":false,"created":"2022-11-04T04:34:00Z","paid":false},{"id":"lyxnvsiy1y4ug887","body":"Updated `11072022-144814`\n\n- [GitHub Issue](https:\/\/github.com\/extratone\/i\/issues\/284)\n- [**RoutineHub Page**](https:\/\/routinehub.co\/shortcut\/13334)\n- [Example Output Gist](https:\/\/gist.github.com\/extratone\/28a4a0060886436420ece95ac8670972)\n- [Shared Example Apple Note](https:\/\/www.icloud.com\/notes\/06d0m6YPYgqMC2z4nanNguUuQ)\n- [David Blue’s RoutineHub Library](drafts:\/\/open?uuid=CA94DF33-CAB9-40A0-836E-806225D5B600)\n- [iCloud Share Link](https:\/\/www.icloud.com\/shortcuts\/09224e868bd249b69a887b96eed1d78a)\n- [Working Copy](working-copy:\/\/open?repo=i&path=shortcuts&mode=content)\n- [Source Repo File](https:\/\/github.com\/extratone\/i\/blob\/main\/shortcuts\/SpringTweetCapture.shortcut)\n- [Ulysses](ulysses:\/\/x-callback-url\/open?id=_gZJh0DqIf7_futTS9wUZg)\n- [Chaff](https:\/\/chaff.writeas.com\/spring-tweet-capture-shortcut\/edit)\n- [WTF](https:\/\/davidblue.wtf\/drafts\/98C2D48D-1E17-4D85-97E4-9348692EE603.html)\n- [WTF Shortlink](https:\/\/davidblue.wtf\/springtweetcapture) - `https:\/\/davidblue.wtf\/springtweetcapture`\n- [Things](things:\/\/\/show?id=GeWhBEqtXZZ7KGQ6HxYxU5)\n\n---\n\n## Social \n\n- [Handset Magazine](https:\/\/handsetmag.wordpress.com\/2022\/11\/06\/spring-tweet-capture-siri-shortcut\/)\n\n---\n\n## Detailed\/customizable Tweet data retrieval\/archiving with Spring for Twitter's actions.\n\nAs configured at install, this shortcut saves all available data from [Spring for Twitter](https:\/\/apps.apple.com\/us\/app\/spring-for-twitter\/id1508706541)'s `Get Tweet` action in three separate locations:\n\n[![Custom Dictionary Default Layout](https:\/\/user-images.githubusercontent.com\/43663476\/200196589-1b56e4b3-2936-4635-a311-ffb2f97c372f.png)](https:\/\/davidblue.wtf\/springtweetcapture\/source)\n\n1.

opposition of silence, than to be alive is to be noisy, yes?\n\nA predominant sentiment in literature throughout human history has been a desire to *feel alive*, and a great many spiritual belief systems fudamentally regard *life* (and\/or *everlasting life*) to be most Holy. Therefore, if we want to be Holy; if we want to live forever, we must be as *loud* as possible.\n\n*Extratone*'s namesake is perhaps the clangorest musical genre that will ever exist. I'm not sure if that makes us divine, but at least we know we are alive.\n\nFriends and colleagues,\nLet us be loud.\n\n---\n\n## Itty\n\n```json\n{\n  \"davodtime\": \"12012022-120327\",\n  \"raw\": \"https:\/\/itty.bitty.site\/The-Holy-Noise\/d\/Quote-from-the-end-of-a-long--dead-newsletter.\/f\/https%3A%2F%2Fdavidblue.wtf%2Fassets%2Ffavicon.ico\/#\/?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\",\n  \"short\": \"https:\/\/bit.ly\/holyextratone\",\n  \"title\": \"The Holy Noise\"\n}\n```","views":53,"updated":"2022-12-01T18:05:33Z","tags":[],"type":null,"title":"","slug":"the-holiest-noise","appearance":"norm","language":"","rtl":false,"created":"2022-12-01T18:05:33Z","paid":false},{"id":"h5b56k9a4tjfv2lw","body":"# .fpl Route Extractor Shortcut\nUpdated `12272022-065214`\n\n- [GitHub Issue](https:\/\/github.com\/extratone\/i\/issues\/294)\n- [**RoutineHub Page**](https:\/\/routinehub.co\/shortcut\/)\n- [David Blue’s RoutineHub Library](drafts:\/\/open?uuid=CA94DF33-CAB9-40A0-836E-806225D5B600)\n- [iCloud Share Link](https:\/\/www.icloud.com\/shortcuts\/b8d8356bf7fb4fd99c57671cfe5f504e)\n- [Working Copy](working-copy:\/\/open?repo=i&path=shortcuts&mode=content)\n- [Source Repo File](https:\/\/github.com\/extratone\/i\/blob\/main\/shortcuts\/.shortcut)\n- [WTF](https:\/\/davidblue.wtf\/drafts\/7D1EFF7C-960D-4A43-AE54-0115E9F2D1BE.html)\n- [Things](things:\/\/\/show?id=FbxR1rUXHfj9KQevxQR6Np)\n\n---\n\n## Social\n\n- Telegram\n\n---\n\n## Extract and copy waypoint identifiers as a space-delimited list.\n\nThis shortcut extracts *exclusively* the usable identifiers from `.fpl` (flight plan) files and copies them as a space-delimited list.

I don't consider the answer - a very weak \"no\" - to be an all-encompassing excuse, whatsoever. If you feel this post's existence has the potential to do real harm, [contact me](https:\/\/davidblue.wtf\/db.vcf) and I *will* straight up take it down. I dare you. Since I consider myself a genuine authority on Text Fucking, however, I am going to do my best to main unapologetic language when expressing opinions in orbit of the matter. You can trust me, I think.\n\nIt’s already as good a place as any, editorially, to initiate the goddamned “*good vs. evil*” discussion because we could very easily find ourselves sincerely addressing the class implications of Text Fucking, otherwise. I want to offer myself, fully, as your test target and\/or guinea pig, if you will. If you’re looking for a phone number upon which to set the sights of any of the methodologies shared here (or otherwise, for that matter,) here is mine: **+1 (573) 823-4380**. If you’re on a mobile device, definitely try out [this link to my full contact card](https:\/\/davidblue.wtf\/db.vcf), and consider this brief list of some other potential targets of mine:\n\n- [Telegram](https:\/\/t.me\/extratone)\n- [Email](mailto:davidblue@extratone.com) \n- [Twitter](https:\/\/twitter.com\/NeoYokel)\n- [Mastodon](https:\/\/mastodon.social\/@DavidBlue)\n- [Discord](https:\/\/discord.gg\/0b9KQUKP858b0iZF)\n- [*Everywhere*](https:\/\/raindrop.io\/davidblue\/social-directory-21059174)...\n\nI won’t share any of your identifying information anywhere, nor will I respond unless you ask, but I *guarantee* I *will* be utterly delighted to receive any volume of Fuckery in any inbox you’re capable of sending it to because I have been so at the half-dozen or so message strings I’ve received over the past few weeks. Even if you somehow manage to find a means of *un*delighting me, that would be a far better scenario for all involved parties than my catching word you used one of my shortcuts to send *Mein Kampf* to a prayer request line or some shit. I promise it will always be more fun to shoot for *constructive disruption* over edgy bullshit, especially in this New Age when nothing is certain and nobody is talking. As much as the person who wrote the Yelp! review, below, would’ve loved to advocate for contribution to the noise for the simple sake of it, he’s fucking dead.\n\n![Discerning Yelp Connoisseur](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/K2E9UV7S.png)\n\nHopefully, we’re now free to get specific. Here’s my definition from [the “Text Fucking” entry](https:\/\/github.com\/extratone\/bilge\/wiki\/Text-Fucking) in [*The Psalms* wiki](https:\/\/github.com\/extratone\/bilge\/wiki):\n\n**text fucking**\n1. **Text Fucking** *verb*\na.) hardcore text manipulation.\nb.) destruction of usable digital text.\n\n2. **Text Fuckery** *noun*\nthe discipline of text fucking.\n\n3. **Text Fuckery** *noun*\nthe output... the *result* of the verb.\n\n[disruption](drafts:\/\/open? uuid=6BFECB0C-8D3C-4E16-9586-16D56DFA6F4B)\n\nI might also append an esp. in either neutral or constructive applications. Again, a Zalgoed Tweet every once in a while is funny, but mass spamming strangers in peer-to-peer spaces is not. Not funny in any sense. To draw a medium parallel with audio - as I will several times in this guide, you’ll find - genuinely disruptive text manipulation is like choosing to push your pirate radio out on the volunteer-run community station’s frequency instead of the corporate-owned hits channel’s. Any sense you might be doing something worthwhile dramatically vanishes and the possibility of accomplishing something a bit *original*, even, is nullified in the womb.\n\n![gm2](https:\/\/i.snap.as\/Cu9MC89q.png)\n\nI won’t say Text Fucking is an art. Indeed, perhaps it is anti-art. It *is* a discipline, nearly. At least enough so that I believe this Post is worth it[^1]. Like most disciplines, it can be used for your particular definitions of “good” and\/or “bad.” I would like to think most of my use over the years has been toward my own of “good,” but - as per the unsearchable nature of Fucked Text, generally - this is not easily verifiable or citable. Regardless of my performance, however, I genuinely believe Text Fucking can be an endeavor that leads to more “positive” outcomes, whoever you may be. As I did, you might find yourself with a greater appreciation of and a desire to learn more about those individuals and organizations working in the Accessible Technology industry, ever toward a more inclusive digital future. It’s my hope that the weaponization of such an otherwise banal part of life might empower you with the simple fact of your capabilities, even if you don’t ever choose to actually implement them in a single instance.\n\n<audio controls>\n  <source src=\"https:\/\/github.com\/extratone\/bilge\/raw\/main\/audio\/Voice%20Notes\/textfucker.mp3\">\n<\/audio>\n\n## History\n\nAs detailed in the audio account embedded above, I believe my Text Fucking career began somewhere around the 7th grade, at 13-14 years old. It was my second or third time flunking MS02 - the Microsoft Office II course - taken on fairly outdated school desktop machines in the 2007-2008 era, all running Windows XP. Because of some inexplicable ability to simply do what I was told, I would spend class periods trying to create the largest possible text file in Notepad by copying and pasting huge, exponentially growing globs. Eventually, I did crash a machine at least once. Though it could very well be simply the self-exaggerated recollection of preteendom, I even remember crashing the school server with one of those files. They were ginormous for plaintext.\n\nhttps:\/\/twitter.com\/NeoYokel\/status\/1495487495622045699\n\nMy Text Fucking reached its peak proliferation in [the Drywall Era](https:\/\/drywallmusic.tumblr.com), when I first discovered the magic of Zalgo Text. The original generator at eemo.net has been replaced by an exact duplicate at [eeemo.net](http:\/\/eeemo.net). I have actually managed to successfully duplicate it [on my own NeoCities website](https:\/\/davidblue.wtf\/zalgo\/), as well. You might say that this original Zalgo Generator is The Original Text Fucking Tool. It can still generate quantities of fucked digital text information that *will* Fuck Shit Up on any social network, and as far as I can tell, the entire program is contained within [a single HTML file](https:\/\/davidblue.wtf\/zalgo\/index.html).\n\n<iframe style=\"border: 0; width: 100%; height: 120px;\" src=\"https:\/\/bandcamp.com\/EmbeddedPlayer\/album=3533156466\/size=large\/bgcol=fff4e6\/linkcol=00006b\/tracklist=false\/artwork=small\/track=549558740\/transparent=true\/\" seamless><a href=\"https:\/\/ihadtopee.bandcamp.com\/album\/suburban-anarchy\">Suburban Anarchy by Drywall<\/a><\/iframe>\n\nAs Drywall’s first and second albums - [*Hamura*](https:\/\/ihadtopee.bandcamp.com\/album\/hamura) and [*Suburban Anarchy*](https:\/\/ihadtopee.bandcamp.com\/album\/suburban-anarchy), respectively - were studies in [audio clipping](https:\/\/en.m.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Clipping_(audio)), I felt strongly at the time that Zalgo Text was the digital text equivalent, though there were others. The latter’s most wildly-entitled track, “Í£Í†Ì„Ì“Ì‡Ì¿Í›ÍÍŽÍÍ¬Ìƒ&ÍÌµÍ‡Ì Ì¥ÌªÌ„ÌÍŒÍ¯Ì“​$​Ì¯Ì»Ì£ÍšÍ’Ì‰ÌÍ‘,” does not actually include any Zalgo text in its title’s final form, [on Bandcamp](https:\/\/ihadtopee.bandcamp.com\/track\/-)[^6], yet I think we can agree it is thoroughly Fucked. *Beyond The Rails* was my cringey “label” name, directly describing, technically, the matter of clipping audio. Indeed, Zalgo Text goes beyond the “rails” of text input\/display fields reliably, depending on the intensity of the configuration you’re using to create it. \n\nhttps:\/\/twitter.com\/NeoYokel\/status\/1493041887279734784\n\nWhen [iMovie for iPhone](https:\/\/apps.apple.com\/us\/app\/imovie\/id377298193) first became available, making actual video editing and creation possible on iPhone OS in the iPhone 4 era, I took advantage of a very particular - but extremely powerful - function that was originally allowed creators on YouTube’s iOS app. It’s very hard to describe without being able to show, but it allowed for the rapid addition of tags to any video via an autocomplete-ish feature, up to the full tag limit. The series of Drywall videos that were essentially just vlogs shot from our high school lunch table - entitled *Men and Women of The Armed Forces, This is What You are Fighting For*[^7] (MAWOTAFTIWYAFF) - were all thoroughly tagged this way.\n\nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=-5eMO8PJJp4\n\nThe most notable event in my personal text history, though, happened on Mastodon - as much does these days, if you weren’t aware. I was [posting about Zalgo text’s creation](https:\/\/mastodon.social\/@DavidBlue\/102564857843257870) when **its actual creator**, Dave Higgins - with whom I’d unknowingly been mutuals for some time, apparently - [replied](https:\/\/octodon.social\/@DaveHiggins\/102565065494333224):\n\n<iframe src=\"https:\/\/octodon.social\/@DaveHiggins\/102565065494333224\/embed\" class=\"mastodon-embed\" style=\"max-width: 100%; border: 0\" width=\"400\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe>\n\nIf there is a living God\/Ultimate Sage\/Premiere Authority\/Professor of Text Fucking, surely it is they, so to have a conversation with them was quite an honor, especially to be able to [call them father](https:\/\/mastodon.social\/@DavidBlue\/102565952197076202), of sorts. I continue to pursue this discipline in a largely automated way, as we’ll discuss in depth. It’s not an especially practical or beneficial one, no, but it is mine. (And Dave Higgins’, to be fair.)\n\n## Apps\n\nThe core necessity of any good Text Fucker is a robust text editing and\/or word processing application. Zalgo text is a real bitch for Electron apps like my dearest [Typora](https:\/\/typora.io), unfortunately. On iOS, this summation also applies to [Obsidian](https:\/\/obsidian.md), I’m afraid. I recommend native apps like [Drafts](https:\/\/apps.apple.com\/us\/app\/drafts\/id1435957248) (big surprise) - which astonishingly has [**its very own native Zalgo action**](https:\/\/actions.getdrafts.com\/a\/1vM) as developer Greg’s [gift to me](https:\/\/twitter.com\/draftsapp\/status\/1492645727729766400)! - and [Bear](https:\/\/apps.apple.com\/us\/app\/bear-markdown-notes\/id1016366447) (no less of a surprise.) In terms of default configuration intensity, the Drafts action hits the sweet spot out of the box.\n\nhttps:\/\/twitter.com\/draftsapp\/status\/1492645727729766400\n\nIf you don’t believe me, here are some more particularly robust text editors on iOS:\n\n- [Kodex](https:\/\/apps.apple.com\/us\/app\/kodex\/id1038574481)\n- [Koder](https:\/\/apps.apple.com\/us\/app\/koder-code-editor\/id1447489375)\n- [Taio](https:\/\/apps.apple.com\/us\/app\/taio-markdown-text-actions\/id1527036273)\n- [Typewriter](https:\/\/apps.apple.com\/us\/app\/typewriter-for-markdown\/id1556419263)\n- [Runestone](https:\/\/testflight.apple.com\/join\/Q6S1cuCd) (Beta)\n\nIf that’s not enough for you, I suggest perusing [Brett Terpstra’s iTextEditors Wiki](https:\/\/brettterpstra.com\/ios-text-editors).\n\nI have previously reviewed two wonderful Text Fucking iOS apps on this blog: [**UniChar**](https:\/\/bilge.world\/unichar-for-ios-app-review) and [**Zalgo Generator**](https:\/\/bilge.world\/zalgo-generator-ios-app-review). There’s now [a macOS version of the latter](https:\/\/apps.apple.com\/us\/app\/zalgo-generator\/id1304137527) which is particularly powerful - or at least has particularly powerful implications. There are a few more to be discovered, though:\n\n![TextcraftIcon](https:\/\/user-images.githubusercontent.com\/43663476\/153724474-6a64b3d3-cb87-428e-81d6-a900746f9886.png)\n\n### Textcraft\n\n[**Textcraft**](https:\/\/apps.apple.com\/us\/app\/textcraft\/id1546719359), by [Aviary](https:\/\/apps.apple.com\/us\/app\/aviary-for-twitter\/id1522043420) and [Mast](https:\/\/apps.apple.com\/us\/app\/mast-for-mastodon\/id1437429129) creator, [Shihab Meboob](https:\/\/apps.apple.com\/us\/developer\/shihab-mehboob\/id1533949185), has become my goto Text Fucking app - even above [Zalgo Generator](https:\/\/apps.apple.com\/us\/app\/zalgo-generator\/id1304137527), I’m somewhat sad to say - on both iOS and macOS.\n\n![Textcraft for macOS](https:\/\/user-images.githubusercontent.com\/43663476\/153737944-46db7da5-6d85-41da-abd1-78a54bb58b99.png)\n\nTextcraft offers a customizable list of 90 live “transformations” to the text you’re entering. Here’s a directly-quoted list of use cases from [the app’s press kit](https:\/\/071cf2cf-09dc-47f7-a1e6-296ba59e1c3a.filesusr.com\/archives\/5aca2a_49a996e8434a485098cc73c2e2b4f36e.zip? dn=Textcraft_PressKit_ShihabMehboob.zip):\n\n- For a casual tweeter who wants to TyPe LiKe ThIs with minimal effort. \n- For an influencer needing to add hashtags before all of their words in a massive word cloud sentence before uploading to Instagram.\n- For the coder\/designer needing to strip HTML or encode\/decode strings in Base64.\n- For the blogger wanting fancy text in bubbles, squares, cursive, or stylised differently on their website.\n- For the website designer who wants to add underscores between all words for use in code, or change the format between cases.\n- For the journalist who wants to redact or underline some text.\n- For the cryptographer who wants to convert strings to SHA128 and SHA256.\n\nIn my personal use, I’ve noticed it’s by far the quickest way to add m   u   l   t   i   p   l   e       c   h   a   r   a   c   t   e   r       s   p   a   c   e   s I’ve ever come across, all enabled by the app’s one-touch-to-copy function. As I said in [my App Store review](https:\/\/tilde.town\/~extratone\/appreviews\/textcraft), the iOS app weighs in at a featherweight 3.7 MB and a reasonable $4.99 one-time purchase fee, which is high value for someone like me.\n\n![TextExpanderIcon](https:\/\/user-images.githubusercontent.com\/43663476\/153726269-6d8cee5d-116b-4b28-99a0-91842e502456.png)\n\n### TextExpander\n\nAnother cross-platform application - this one [extending to Windows](https:\/\/textexpander.com\/download), too - TextExpander has very recently (and quite swiftly) become an integral part of my day-to-day creative life. It’s used by professionals at companies with “thousands of people,” supposedly, to “expand” any sort of text, set off scripts (on macOS,) and paste fill in-able templates. These functions are divided into “[snippets](https:\/\/textexpander.com\/learn\/getting-started)” as part of “[snippet groups](https:\/\/textexpander.com\/learn\/getting-started\/getting-started-for-admin).” In fact, I’ve created [**a dedicated snippet group to accompany this guide**](https:\/\/app.textexpander.com\/public\/12c50fb2360617d3cc66d757cf26383b). You can view all my TextExpander snippets in [this GitHub Repository](https:\/\/github.com\/extratone\/TextExpander).\n\n![TextFuckSnippetGroup](https:\/\/user-images.githubusercontent.com\/43663476\/153726468-25b5a5a9-0381-4720-b1e7-c7fb2ef357d9.png)\n\nIt’s not much just yet, but if you “[subscribe](https:\/\/app.textexpander.com\/public\/12c50fb2360617d3cc66d757cf26383b)” to my dedicated Text Fuck snippet group from your own account, you’ll be treated to whatever I come up with in the future, delivered to your devices in real time.[ ^5] The great pro of TextExpander is its target pro usergroup, for which it is built to be reliable and very powerful. It enables quick macros for strings as short as ⁌•-¬䷂☃︎𝄫𝄢⟫L𝔒’⌤⌄∔×−฿🄕𝄢 up to [entire book chapters](https:\/\/bilge.world\/blimps-burden-chapter-6). It also has more complex functions, likely the most relevant to our use of which being clipboard insertion anywhere within a snippet. Crucial to the strong Text Fucker, this function has high potential for multiplied volume. One might set up a snippet that duplicates the clipboard’s content nine times on new lines and attach the macro `\\9`. \n\n![COMIN DINE](https:\/\/user-images.githubusercontent.com\/43663476\/154876382-95749054-1a47-4dec-9e4d-0c2e1229f79e.png)\n\n## Automation\n\nDebatably, my personal history with automation began with the release of IFTT (now [IFTTT](https:\/\/apps.apple.com\/us\/app\/ifttt-automation-workflow\/id660944635)) somewhere around 2010-2011. Once it was integrated with Twitter and Evernote, I set it to save all of my Twitter favorites in separate, tagged Evernotes. The result was quite tremendous, as you might imagine, and is partially immortalized in my current [Twitter Raindrop collection](https:\/\/raindrop.io\/davidblue\/twitter-13759854). Tremendous, but not in a Text Fucking sense. Sometime just after high school, though, I configured an IFTT recipe that posted “WHEN IM COMIN DINE IN MY FOREIGN AND IM ROLLIN ONE DEEP THAT SHOULD TELL YA BOUT ME” across my social networks, every morning at 6:10 AM.\n\nhttps:\/\/twitter.com\/NeoYokel\/status\/1492783081593483266\n\nIt was in the same era that one of my handful of lifetime genius ideas came to me: it occurred to me that I could automate [the Drywall Tumblr page](https:\/\/drywallmusic.tumblr.com) entirely by signing up its “post via email” address for all the spam lists I could find. The result is axiomatic. It is also Text Fucking, emphatically. Though I certainly didn’t know it by the name “automation,” then - nor did I associate the term with anything digital, really - contemporary personal automation enables virtually infinite Text Fucking possibilities. No longer does one have to manually copy the entirety of a huge Wikipedia page in order to break their friend’s phone for 5 days - now, they need only configure a native app on their cellular telephone to send [the whole of the *Spy Kids 3* screenplay](https:\/\/routinehub.co\/shortcut\/10919), for instance, to said friend, in the background, even, as they continue scrolling through the Ticking App.\n\nOf course, while the means of *distributing* Text Fuckery have gotten vastly more robust, capable, and sophisticated, so too have the terminals by which intended targets *experience* the Fuckery. The friend’s handset and elemental carrier plan in our example may very well be perfectly capable of receiving an entire film script, line-by-line, also in the background, perhaps even without the target ever noticing or suffering a single consequence. \n\n### Siri Shortcuts\n\n![TextFuckShortcuts](https:\/\/user-images.githubusercontent.com\/43663476\/153750918-ca0c5eb6-0d91-4d7f-b70b-550f0f44c528.png)\n\nA standalone method of general Text Fuckery on iOS is achieved through its relatively “new”[^2] personal automation system, Siri Shortcuts. In fact, Apple includes what I would define as a genuine Text Fucker™ of a shortcut in its default shortcuts gallery, called “[All the Single Ladies ASCII](https:\/\/www.icloud.com\/shortcuts\/51392bf23f104b93baf72000955ed334)” which can be used to create rather adorable text snippets like this:\n\n```txt\n(•_•)\n<)   )╯DAVID BLUE\n \/    \\ \n\n  (•_•)\n \\(   (> WROTE\n  \/    \\\n\n (•_•)\n<)   )╯THIS.\n \/    \\\n```\n\nThrough a Reddit thread I’ve never been able to find again, I discovered a method of randomizing strings of text that led to the creation of the Shortcuts you see at the bottom of this section, all with native actions (aside from the outputs of those with specific services.) If you’re willing to splurge on the whole 3.3mb, free (for macOS, iPadOS, and iOS) [**Actions app**](https:\/\/apps.apple.com\/us\/app\/actions\/id1586435171), you can accomplish the same task, but much more quickly and with less resource consumption. I think you can spare the space.[ ^3]\n\nPerhaps the best place to start would be with the most documented (and perhaps most unique) Text Fucking Siri Shortcut I have to offer you. “[The Fastest Route to Twitter Jail](https:\/\/bilge.world\/twitter-jail)” in fact details the workings of [**my Twitter Jail shortcut**](https:\/\/routinehub.co\/shortcut\/11086\/), which uses [Tweetbot](http:\/\/bilge.world\/tweetbot-6-ios-review)’s shortcuts actions to send 310 Tweets of random text in less than four minutes to an account of your specification. \n\n![Random Text ⇨ Clipboard](https:\/\/user-images.githubusercontent.com\/43663476\/153768899-51ed409f-7fef-46d0-978f-8a5fc19ad5f7.png)\n\nIf you’re new to Shorcuts entirely, what you see above will result in a string of random text copied to your clipboard, so that you can paste it whereever you might “need” to. Notably, I’ve been extremely lazy with the strings, despite having [the absolute best app for creating them](https:\/\/apps.apple.com\/us\/app\/unichar-unicode-keyboard\/id880811847) on my iPhone. I’d suggest you download it and play around yourself. As I said in [my review](http:\/\/bilge.world\/unichar-for-ios-app-review), UniChar is a beautiful celebration of the diversity of Unicode. If what I’m talking about isn’t straightforward-sounding to you, [let me know](https:\/\/davidblue.wtf\/db.vcf)! I absolutely *will* sit down and build something just for you.\n \n![RandomTextAction](https:\/\/user-images.githubusercontent.com\/43663476\/153781368-a58bbb73-5675-48d6-9317-3538701a27d1.png)\n\n#### Text-Fucking Siri Shortcuts with Actions\n\nThese three shortcuts require [the Actions app](https:\/\/apps.apple.com\/us\/app\/actions\/id1586435171), but the single action used across all of them - called `Random Text` - is one that works across all platforms. \n\n- [Random Characters ⇨ Clipboard](https:\/\/www.icloud.com\/shortcuts\/ed9216202df4481d9ae001b0531384c2)\n- [Random Characters ⇨ Mastodon](https:\/\/www.icloud.com\/shortcuts\/af64b43604334d21ad5a6668471b828f)\n- [Random Characters ⇨ Tumblr](https:\/\/www.icloud.com\/shortcuts\/399a857145e34d8b94b994fa3f9ca300)\n\n#### Text-Fucking Siri Shortcuts with Toolbox Pro, Actions, and Aviary\n\nHere are three shortcuts that may or may not be useful to you, each using Shihab Meboob’s [Aviary](https:\/\/apps.apple.com\/us\/app\/aviary-for-twitter\/id1522043420) to Tweet images en masse. The third also requires you have [LookUp](https:\/\/apps.apple.com\/us\/app\/lookup-english-dictionary\/id872564448) and a populated collection.\n\n- [Tweet Symbol Images](https:\/\/www.icloud.com\/shortcuts\/a328611ebcab4f8ba271c0f89e3a7025)\n- [Tweet Color Images](https:\/\/www.icloud.com\/shortcuts\/192008f53ad74860b1de1d7adccedb69)\n- [Tweet Vocabulary Images](https:\/\/www.icloud.com\/shortcuts\/7417bf83a7a349099e1a50b1b091285b)\n\n#### Native Text-Fucking Siri Shortcuts\n\n- [Random Text ⇨ Twitter](https:\/\/www.icloud.com\/shortcuts\/0873152dee3e4d32828cd28bcbc1be06) ([Tweetbot](https:\/\/apps.apple.com\/us\/app\/tweetbot-6-for-twitter\/id1527500834))\n- [Random Text ⇨ Twitter II](https:\/\/www.icloud.com\/shortcuts\/21ab008699ce44dabc9f9a249fc6f881)\n- [Random Text ⇨ Clipboard](https:\/\/www.icloud.com\/shortcuts\/3bfc10474a254aec8a0f8f89da96d198)\n- [Random Text ⇨ Drafts](https:\/\/www.icloud.com\/shortcuts\/f550febfa39b465b88217e1717f37548)\n- [Random Text ⇨ Mastodon](https:\/\/www.icloud.com\/shortcuts\/0e517d1438b44d3d980c8afb9891a724)\n- [Random Text ⇨ Tumblr](https:\/\/www.icloud.com\/shortcuts\/3c38ca0a7ec9413f9c9a6f6328fb1b09)\n- [Random Text ⇨ WordPress](https:\/\/www.icloud.com\/shortcuts\/07668aacd5ce4e59b76dd54ffc255209)\n\n![Text Case Icon](https:\/\/user-images.githubusercontent.com\/43663476\/154006137-74a7006f-862a-40b1-96e4-258b5b49ed2d.png)\n\n### Text Case\n\nChristopher R Hannah’s [Text Case](https:\/\/apps.apple.com\/us\/app\/text-case\/id1492174677) is by far the most modern of all the dedicated text manipulation applications I have to share with you. Available (separately) on both [macOS](https:\/\/apps.apple.com\/us\/app\/terminology-dictionary\/id687798859) and [iOS](https:\/\/apps.apple.com\/us\/app\/text-case\/id1407730596), it’s a “flow”-based, Siri Shortcuts-resembling text formatting app with some very powerful functions. \n\n![TextCase](https:\/\/user-images.githubusercontent.com\/43663476\/154810776-5ecc4fb5-2fd3-48e3-be1b-d86287cd1965.png)\n\nI know that’s basically word-for-word what anyone else’s had to say about it since its debut, four years ago... I apologize for the redundancy, but the way it works is extremely hard to describe in a way that makes any sense, especially just with a few video clips and\/or static images.[ ^4] \n\n![MLADraft Shortcut](https:\/\/user-images.githubusercontent.com\/43663476\/154823905-90618f3b-45f4-42d0-940f-c8b04d395410.png)\n\nWithout being able to share my own “flows” (unfortunately,) all I can share with you is [this Siri Shortcut](https:\/\/www.icloud.com\/shortcuts\/6fd60faf566142b3b7d1fb0a0631fa1b) which is called from [this Drafts action](https:\/\/actions.getdrafts.com\/a\/1wQ) to reformat selected text (or the entire contents of the current draft) into proper MLA Title format before amending the results to a specific draft. I also created and published a shortcut called “[Speak Word Count](https:\/\/routinehub.co\/shortcut\/11094)” which uses Text Case’s Word Count “format” and [Siri Speech Synthesis](https:\/\/bilge.world\/siri-tts) to speak aloud the word count of either the current selection (from the share sheet) or the contents currently in the system clipboard.\n\n![Fuck Shortcut](https:\/\/user-images.githubusercontent.com\/43663476\/154841943-3ba7b019-c146-4765-90b1-2f52e34f3911.png)\n\nI’ve also created [**Fuck**](https:\/\/www.icloud.com\/shortcuts\/edcc737ed7304a17bb3b4d8897aae29c) - a Siri Shortcut with three of my favorite Text Case formattings so far in succession: “Mocking Spongebob” (ick,) “Upside Down,” and “Clap Case.” It acts upon - and replaces - any text you’ve copied to the clipboard. Here’s an example:\n\n```\nᴉ┴ 👏 ∀ɔʇs 👏 nԀou 👏  👏  👏 ∀up 👏 ɹƎd˥ɐɔǝs 👏  👏  👏 ∀u⅄ 👏 ┴Ǝx┴ 👏 ⅄On’Λǝ 👏 ɔoԀIǝp 👏 ┴o 👏 ʇɥǝ 👏 ɔlᴉdqo∀ɹp\n```\n\n![Dwafts](https:\/\/user-images.githubusercontent.com\/43663476\/157349288-2fff224d-05dd-4bcf-a4e3-feec486ac6fa.png)\n\n### Drafts\n\nThough I already mentioned Drafts’ Zalgo action earlier, the app worth its own heading, here, because it’s what enabled me to generate the text images embedded in this Post with a single keyboard shortcut. The magic is not in fact happening within Drafts, but rather in the Siri Shortcuts it calls and provides text for. These two are customized for me (so you’ll need to delete the actions you don’t want\/need,) but will faithfully reproduce the style of the images you’ve seen as configured for [Toolbox Pro](https:\/\/apps.apple.com\/us\/app\/toolbox-pro-for-shortcuts\/id1476205977) users.\n\n- [DraftsImage](https:\/\/www.icloud.com\/shortcuts\/09d229c3b5064480a30ac784b7edd3ef)\n- [DraftsImageSmall](https:\/\/www.icloud.com\/shortcuts\/fa3b63050cde48e4933bac6d9b1545df)\n\nIf you plan to leave the titles the same, you might just directly install their corresponding actions: [DraftsImage](https:\/\/directory.getdrafts.com\/a\/1x2) and [DraftsImageSmall](https:\/\/directory.getdrafts.com\/a\/1x3). There are a few actions from other creators I have yet to mention. Tim Nahumck’s [Text Modifier](https:\/\/actions.getdrafts.com\/a\/1Bg) action - as pictured in the screenshot embedded below - is a handy one, as is Greg’s own [Unicode Fun](https:\/\/actions.getdrafts.com\/a\/1T2). He also published [Emojify](https:\/\/actions.getdrafts.com\/a\/1ly) and [Fake Wordle](https:\/\/actions.getdrafts.com\/a\/1tf), which I find hilarious.\n\n![Text Modifier Drafts Action](https:\/\/user-images.githubusercontent.com\/43663476\/158194647-1ecacacd-2783-44a7-b4af-2f07b6d6471d.png)\n\n![Single Page, All of Unicode](https:\/\/user-images.githubusercontent.com\/43663476\/158152225-bcad1dc9-f033-4e12-adee-6eb99935fd1d.png)\n\n## Other Tools\n\nThanks to [Taro Yabuki](https:\/\/github.com\/taroyabuki)’s [project](https:\/\/github.com\/taroyabuki\/onepage-unicode-chars) to display all graphical unicode characters in a single page, I created and uploaded [a PDF of them all](https:\/\/davidblue.wtf\/tools\/unicode.pdf), hosted on my NeoCities. If you have trouble viewing it there, you should be able to download it from [this iCloud Drive share link](https:\/\/www.icloud.com\/iclouddrive\/04dxiD0KYZoebradRmjDQOaBg#unicode). There’s quite a myriad of available “weird text” tools available on the open web, found easily with the most basic bitch search engine queries. [MegaCoolTest.com](http:\/\/megacooltext.com) is an old favorite of mine[^8] that functions a lot like Textcraft, come to think of it. \n\nI originally intended to thoroughly test some of the results found when searching the App Store for “[weird text](itms-apps:\/\/search.itunes.apple.com\/WebObjects\/MZSearch.woa\/wa\/search?media=software&term=weird%20text),” but they’re far too numerous and - for the most part - far too janky to be worthwhile.\n\n<!--comment-->\n\n---\n\n#software #spectacle\n\n[1] Whaddya think‽‽‽ [Should I write a book](https:\/\/twitter.com\/NeoYokel\/status\/1492589668843634692)‽‽‽\n[2] I say “new” here because of how many users genuinely have never encountered the concept, whatsoever, even going on five years since Workflow was made native.\n[3] A few of the single images embedded in this Post are larger than that.\n[4] Nevertheless, I shall do my best to remain ashamed of my redundant inadequacy.\n[5] If you find yourself trying it out, you may as well check out my main Snippet Group, [Extratext](https:\/\/app.textexpander.com\/public\/14093096578d4f40eeea15649f5cefbb), which is documented [here](https:\/\/davidblue.wtf\/extratext). \n[6] You might be interested to hear how human Siri Voice 2 sounds [attempting to read the title aloud](https:\/\/twitter.com\/NeoYokel\/status\/1500149497111920642).\n[7] It just now occurred to me that the series title wasn’t exactly gender-inclusive, but the series, itself, wasn’t actually of any value, anyway.\n[8] I’ve also duplicated this one [on my NeoCities](https:\/\/davidblue.wtf\/cool\/).","views":1555,"updated":"2023-11-02T19:15:50Z","tags":["software","spectacle"],"type":null,"title":"How to Fuck Text","slug":"text-fuck","appearance":"norm","language":"en","rtl":false,"created":"2023-04-06T20:38:19Z","images":["https:\/\/user-images.githubusercontent.com\/43663476\/153750918-ca0c5eb6-0d91-4d7f-b70b-550f0f44c528.png","https:\/\/user-images.githubusercontent.com\/43663476\/154841943-3ba7b019-c146-4765-90b1-2f52e34f3911.png","https:\/\/user-images.githubusercontent.com\/43663476\/158194647-1ecacacd-2783-44a7-b4af-2f07b6d6471d.png","https:\/\/user-images.githubusercontent.com\/43663476\/153737944-46db7da5-6d85-41da-abd1-78a54bb58b99.png","https:\/\/user-images.githubusercontent.com\/43663476\/153726269-6d8cee5d-116b-4b28-99a0-91842e502456.png","https:\/\/user-images.githubusercontent.com\/43663476\/154876382-95749054-1a47-4dec-9e4d-0c2e1229f79e.png","https:\/\/user-images.githubusercontent.com\/43663476\/153768899-51ed409f-7fef-46d0-978f-8a5fc19ad5f7.png","https:\/\/user-images.githubusercontent.com\/43663476\/158152225-bcad1dc9-f033-4e12-adee-6eb99935fd1d.png","https:\/\/user-images.githubusercontent.com\/43663476\/153724474-6a64b3d3-cb87-428e-81d6-a900746f9886.png","https:\/\/user-images.githubusercontent.com\/43663476\/153781368-a58bbb73-5675-48d6-9317-3538701a27d1.png","https:\/\/user-images.githubusercontent.com\/43663476\/157349288-2fff224d-05dd-4bcf-a4e3-feec486ac6fa.png","https:\/\/user-images.githubusercontent.com\/43663476\/154823905-90618f3b-45f4-42d0-940f-c8b04d395410.png","https:\/\/i.snap.as\/zeOD3AWR.png","https:\/\/i.snap.as\/K2E9UV7S.png","https:\/\/i.snap.as\/Cu9MC89q.png","https:\/\/user-images.githubusercontent.com\/43663476\/153726468-25b5a5a9-0381-4720-b1e7-c7fb2ef357d9.png","https:\/\/user-images.githubusercontent.com\/43663476\/154006137-74a7006f-862a-40b1-96e4-258b5b49ed2d.png","https:\/\/user-images.githubusercontent.com\/43663476\/154810776-5ecc4fb5-2fd3-48e3-be1b-d86287cd1965.png"],"collection":{"public":false,"alias":"bilge","total_posts":0,"title":"The Psalms","verification_link":"","description":"A <a href=\"https:\/\/davidblue.wtf\/db.vcf\">narcoleptic yokel<\/a> on software and culture.","style_sheet":"","views":177027,"monetization_pointer":""},"paid":false},{"id":"2mony9btq2pgmvh4","body":"# apotheosis\n\n## Noun\n\n1. model of excellence or perfection of a kind;

To be honest, I can’t imagine moving through life and *not* creating my own words from time to time, but I understand we’re all different.\n\nIf you’re a [Drafts](https:\/\/apps.apple.com\/us\/app\/drafts\/id1236254471 \"Drafts for iOS\/iPadOS on the App Store\") user, I would consider Terminology an absolute must-have. It took me five minutes to establish actions on both apps which allow me to lookup selected words with a keyboard shortcut `^⇧D` from the former instantly in the latter and - with a single tap - return definitions, synonyms, and antonyms to a new draft. It’s wonderful, absolutely indispensable, and fun!\n\n<!--comment-->","views":76,"updated":"2023-04-21T07:03:38Z","tags":[],"type":null,"title":"Terminology Dictionary App Store Review","slug":"terminology-dictionary","appearance":"norm","language":"","rtl":false,"created":"2023-04-21T07:02:36Z","images":["https:\/\/tilde.town\/~extratone\/appreviews\/terminology\/terminology.png"],"paid":false},{"id":"vs1nvkg977gk7cd3","body":"```markdown\nThis is actually a somewhat functional page.

In the right hour, the fickle wind and the social owls were the only sound, and nothing moved but the sparse, light-footed doe in careful segments with her fawn. From the main gated lane of *The Nice, Huge Estate*, Lenny Lather slid through the muddy barrier and started bouncing West on the blacktop, brogues squeaking every third step. The overcasted clouds were having trouble deciding whether or not to let down their rain – as they had been all day – and the old, heavy early-March mist softened the yellow glow of the tall, buzzing streetlamps so much that he couldn’t help but intermittently wipe his eyes, for the spreading light convinced his mind that his eyelashes must’ve been wetted.\n\nTheodore Pith’s big old house was now burrowed between two mismatched neighborhoods – the bleaker Easterly, which was too new for its alien trees to have recovered from the brutality of its development’s clear-cutting and contained within one of its central featureless backyards an unidentifiable creature which made all through the night the most unimaginably ghastly, disturbingly human child-like shrieking; the opposing Westerly’s trees further enough along in their regrowth – ten or twenty years perhaps – to appear more of the planet Earth to Manhattan-bred Lenny Lather, who still found the colorless destruction of suburbia unendingly upsetting, especially when coming down. In the interest of his regular withdrawal’s mitigation, he had already established two short, repeatable tracks and a longer, several mile-long loop which skirted him sufficiently around the East’s center to avoid hearing the shrieks in all but the stillest nights. Never in his years – on these walks he was *especially* reminded of just how many there were – had he been able to feel such absolute ownership of his surroundings. The eroding Earth slipping away from the hem of the warped, stained wood fences; the sidewalks, cracked, bent, sloped helter-skelter, often muddied in the troughs and joints – generally laying haphazardly in layers after having been steadily tossed about by the glacial forces of their intermixture with clay, precipitation, and the tumultuous temperature-dependent torture of the two – these were his, entirely, in the right hour. Between two and five in the morning when the earliest risers would blearily revive their dewy automobiles from long, silent hibernation, the whole world – everything in his sight and more at any moment – it was all *his*, without a single worthy challenger.\n\nIn the right hour, the roads were completely and totally abandoned – for the New Yorker, an unfathomable absolute – and all humanity was at rest. In the right hour, Lenny Lather was the appointed guardian of the worn domesticity of a small nation, though the lonely occupation was astoundingly lax, for in the miles and miles of empty streets he had already traversed in his nightly holidays from the World of Pith, he had yet to encounter a single unexpected factor or minutely threatening presence. Since shortly after his December arrival, he’d walked through even the most frigid mornings. Of course, the stillness had then been *even more* otherworldly, and Lenny was curious to see how his new most private domain would change with the seasons. Though the auxiliary guest room which he now called home was no smaller or less hospitable than the master bedroom of his late Hudson Yards flat shared with his late Wife, it proved to be a poor respite from Theodore Pith, who treated him – when they were “home” at *Nice, Huge* – as the puppy he never had, and expected his participation to remain entirely vulnerable to his any whim. Granted – in their shared abuse of amphetamines, cocaine, and assorted other stimulants – Lenny Lather was vastly more prepared for the games than any circadian guest could’ve possibly been. At first, the ten-foot door of his dawn-facing room had closed without latching, but with the warmth and moisture brought with the Midwestern Spring, the most secure state in which the engorged wood could be forcibly arranged still left a half-inch crack, and Lather’s last chance of privacy was lost.\n\nThe latest favorite pastime of *Nice, Big*’s Master necessitated a willing, capable driver, and – as keeping a single Butler (much less an entire household staff) was proving extremely difficult for him – Lenny Lather was the sole pick of the draft. In the earliest hours of one Tuesday morning in February, he’d been pleasantly dosing and drooling on his laptop after an evening of obsessive, incoherent notetaking when the huge door had been kicked ajar by a deep black, blindingly shiny oxford with excessively violent force. Attached to the shoe in an equally blinding penguin tuxedo, towering bowler hat, and cartoonish fake mustache was the Great, Blown Pith.\n\n“Hope you’re not busy,” he’d said quite loudly to the lolling Lather, leaning and tilting his head into the lamp light, which had dislodged his monocle and briefly occupied him with untangling its chain.\n\n…\n\n“You’re not *busy*, are ya?!” he’d shouted, tapping the shiny brass lion’s head of his shiny black cane against the vanity… then swatting it with a flicking wrist… then clubbing it with a full, two-handed homerun swing – taking huge, vaguely cat nose-shaped gouges from the surface of the wood. The splintery wood chips had rained down upon the hunched Lenny; he’d stirred with one found its way in his open mouth – he’d chewed it slowly and swallowed it, but he still had not awoken. Nevertheless, Theodore Pith’s coked-up enthusiasm couldn’t possibly have yielded to common decencies like his guest’s nighttime peace.\n\n…\n\n“SHOOT, LENNY,” he’d screamed in his companion’s ear, having traversed the room to his bedside.\n\n“I SURE HOPE YOU’RE NOT BUSY RIGHT NOW!”\n\n…\n\nFinally, he’d resorted to tickling Lenny’s nose with the ornament, which had reeked with the urinal smell of metal polish – the sudden, overwhelming delivery of which to the writer’s olfactory nerves finally causing ample alarm in his nervous system to justify bringing him abruptly back to his life and deluded host.\n\n“I need a favor. The Duesie’s warming up. We’re going for a ride.”\n\nUnable to form a linguistic response, Lenny Lather had obeyed Theo’s frenzied, repeating instructions and stumbled into the matching suit he’d brought over his arm – wondering with marginal, arrested clarity at how well-tailored it was for him. He had not the soundness of perception to protest when Pith had whipped a deep black, blindingly shiny bowtie around his already-congested esophagus, nor when he’d adheased the huge, itchy matching fake moustache to his upper lip and nearly pulled the matching Tower of Bowler all the way down over his ears. He had been unresponsive when he’d been sat on the bench under the agonizing fluorescent lights of the laundry room, affixed with deep black, blindingly shiny matching oxfords, and asked if he smoked and how well he could say *guffaw.*\n\n…\n\n“Just wait… you have no idea… you have no idea how much fun this is going to be.”\n\nLenny Lather had not… *could not* have made a sound through the confusing nonsense of his waking pre-Great Depression dream, but when the old servant’s door had been opened before him and set the heartless, single-digit Winter wind upon his very soul, he had all at once arrived in the world, laughing and whooping together with Theodore Pith.\n\n“Jesus *Christ!*” he’d screamed as they’d hobbled to the stable, where a devilishly dark red Model J Duesenberg had sat shivering in a rough idle, staring out the retrofitted garage door with its basketball-sized lights as if it was, indeed, a flesh-and-blood steed that had just been frightened awake by a thunderstorm, but the sky had been as clear as it would’ve been from an asteroid – as it is only on the coldest nights – and almost comically dominated by the setting, gluttonously luminescent moon. Theodore had then grabbed a screwdriver from the workbench and bent down to remove the license plate – which had said *BLOOD* in big black bold block letters – and its containing frame. By the time he had settled into the frigid red leather of the exposed, roofless driver’s seat, Lenny Lather was full-to-bursting with adrenaline and laughing out huge streams of breathy steam. From behind him in the cabin, Pith had been *guffawing* plumes, too, as he’d briefly ignited his cocaine-sprinkled mustache instead of the bratwurst-sized cigar between his teeth. The smell of burning human hair had accented his explanation of the old car’s transmission and its direct path from source-to-nose for Pith had required a brief, unplanned intermission as it induced without warning his violent heaving – still part-*guffawing* – hanging half out of his beautifully-upholstered suicide door.\n\nAs he had spewed – expertly sparing the swoop of the gleaming waxy fender – Lenny had found a pair of deep black, blindingly shiny gloves and – after less grinding than you would imagine, to his credit – first gear, setting the whole dastardly circus in motion.\n\n“Where to, Sire?” Lenny had asked, nose lifted to an untenable altitude in a pitiful approximation of an accent that’d never actually been used before by any person or persons in all of history, struggling for breath.\n\n“Left at the gates, Barnsward, old chap,” Theodore had replied in a contrasting fashion after again sitting upright from his heaves and taking a breath, ironing out – if anything – the flatness of his perforating Ohio Ds and Ps, resulting in such a culturally destructive racket that it had set both of them in uncontrollable, cloudy fits lasting long after Lather had swerved the great length of the car from the gravel to his abandoned asphalt retreat. The two had continued their banter down that soul-suckingly flat vector, one-upping each other’s etymologic barbarity against the savage thievery of the heatless wind.\n\n“Now to star-board, Budleigh, my good fellow!”\n\n…\n\n“Right-o, as you say, sir!”\n\n…\n\n“Down to the *pu-hb* for a *spaht* of *brahn*-dee with me *mae-its*!”\n\n…\n\n“*Oncemo-ar* right, pip pip!”\n\n…\n\n“By *jah-lee*, there we are!”\n\n…\n\nAfter the entirety of Northern European history had been decimated and subsequently forgotten, the Duesenberg named *BLOOD* had turned its orange, googley-eyed stare and narrow whitewalled hooves up the reflective, freshly-painted access of the new 24-hour grocery in the no-man’s-land between the cookie-cutter stares of the neatly-rowed Easterly neighborhood and the droning respiration of Interstate 43, two miles distant. It was 2:12 in the morning and most of the greasy-haired night stocking shift had been halfway through their third smoke break, circled around a store-used picnic table 50 yards from the far sliding airlock doors. The first to spot *BLOOD* had been the second shortest of the lot, whose weary scrutiny along the truest radian to the West from under his sweaty beanie in her entrance she had crossed, and the depth of her red as he first spied it had caused him vertigo – as if he would fall in – and cast upon the shorter-than-average length of his being an all-consuming existential doubt. The tallest and loudest of them had faced squarest the white faux-brick wall of the box building and was at that moment engaged upon a spirited rant about where and where’nt and when a vapist ought to buy his Suck juice between long, gasping Sucks from his super-shiny Suck box. Of course, the arrival of a customer even at such a late hour did not warrant notice at a huge, broadly-servicing operation like theirs, but as *BLOOD* had crept through all four reflective yellow-checkered pedestrian crossings, closing without a flinch, and the details of her occupying caricatures had become more and more numerous, she had stolen the attention of the huddle, one-by-one, and elicited from each the rarest under-breath profanity of true, unmolested wonder.\n\n“*Jesus Christ*,” had said the shortest.\n\n“*Holy fuck,*” had said the youngest.\n\n“*Gee whiz*,” had said the oldest.\n\n\n## Horizontal Rules\n\n___\n\n---\n\n***\n\n\n## Typographic replacements\n\nEnable typographer option to see result.\n\n(c) (C) (r) (R) (tm) (TM) (p) (P) +-\n\ntest.. test... test..... test?..... test!....\n\n!!!!!! ???? ,,  -- ---\n\n\"Smartypants, double quotes\" and 'single quotes'\n\n\n## Emphasis\n\n**This is bold text**\n\n__This is bold text__\n\n*This is italic text*\n\n_This is italic text_\n\n<u>This is underlined text<\/u>\n\n~~Strikethrough~~\n\n\n## Blockquotes\n\n\n> Blockquotes can also be nested...\n>\n> > ...by using additional greater-than signs right next to each other...\n> >\n> > > ...or with spaces between arrows.\n\n\n## Lists\n\nUnordered\n\n+ Create a list by starting a line with `+`, `-`, or `*`\n\n+ Sub-lists are made by indenting 2 spaces:\n\n  - Marker character change forces new list start:\n\n    * Ac tristique libero volutpat at\n\n    + Facilisis in pretium nisl aliquet\n\n    - Nulla volutpat aliquam velit\n\n+ Very easy!\n\nOrdered\n\n1.

Except as specifically amended below, full Apple Media Services Terms and Conditions for your region apply and are hereby incorporated by reference, and defined terms shall have the meanings set forth in the Apple Media Services Terms and Conditions, except as noted herein. For the purpose of these TestFlight Terms of Service, the term “Licensed Application” shall include Beta Apps. See Apple Media Services Terms and Conditions: https:\/\/www.apple.com\/legal\/internet-services\/itunes\/.  \n\nSpecific Terms for Beta-Testers  \n\nChildren under the age of 13, or equivalent minimum age in the relevant jurisdiction, are not permitted to use TestFlight. If you are 13 or the equivalent minimum age in the relevant jurisdiction or older, but under the age of 18, you should review this Agreement with your parent or guardian to make sure that you and your parent or guardian understand and agree to the following terms.  \n\nTestFlight is designed to help third-party developers (“Application Providers”) beta-test and improve the performance of their pre-release applications for Mac, iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch, Apple TV, or other Apple-branded hardware and to provide beta-testers with Beta Apps. If an Application Provider authorizes you as a beta-tester and you choose to download the corresponding Beta App from the Application Provider via TestFlight, then conditioned on your compliance with these TestFlight Terms of Service, the Application Provider grants you a limited, non- exclusive, non-assignable, non-sublicensable license to access, download and use the Beta App for which you have been selected as a beta-tester and any related documentation available online, solely for beta- testing purposes for a limited time and subject to these TestFlight Terms of Service.  \n\nAs between you and the Application Provider, and aside from the limited license set forth above, the Application Provider owns all right, title and interest in the Beta App, including but not limited to intellectual property rights. To the maximum extent permitted by law, you may not: (a) modify, reverse engineer, decompile, or disassemble any Beta App; (b) rent, lease, loan, sell, sublicense, distribute, transmit, or otherwise transfer any Beta App; (c) make any copy of or otherwise reproduce any Beta App; or (d) display any Beta App to unauthorized third parties without the Application Providerʼs authorization.  \n\nYou agree to use reasonable efforts to beta-test any Beta App.  \n\nYou acknowledge that you understand that Beta Apps are pre-release, alpha, or beta software and may be incomplete or could contain errors or inaccuracies. You should not use Beta Apps in a commercial operating environment or with important data. You should back up any data prior to using any Beta App on your Apple-branded device. Neither Apple nor the Application Provider shall be responsible for any costs, expenses or other liabilities you may incur as a result of using any Beta Apps, including but not limited to any damage, loss, or corruption of any software, information or data. Further, Beta Apps may not be compatible with production Apps. If you have a production version of a Beta App already installed on your Apple-branded device, you should back-up any data associated with such app prior to installing a beta version since data may be corrupted or lost between different versions of the same app. You expressly acknowledge and agree that any use of Beta Apps is done entirely at your own risk.  \n\nIn addition, if you have the full version of an app installed on your device and you install the same Beta App, your app data may be corrupted or lost and may not be recoverable. You should back up your information before installing a Beta App. Solely for the purposes of testing a Beta App and only for the duration of such test, any in-app purchases made within the Beta App will be made available to you at no cost and such purchases will not be charged to your Account. If you purchase or download the App from the App Store, your data may not remain available from within the full version. We recommend that you back up your data before deleting the Beta App or purchasing the full version from the App Store.  \n\nBeta Apps provided by Apple and\/or third-party developers may not be available in all languages or in all countries, and Apple makes no representation that the Beta Apps are appropriate or available for use in any particular location. To the extent you choose to access and use the Beta Apps through TestFlight, you do so at your own initiative and are responsible for compliance with any applicable laws. Beta Apps are time-limited and TestFlight may change, limit, or cease providing access to Beta Apps any time without notice or liability to you. You further understand and agree that certain information about a Beta App downloaded via TestFlight may not be available to you prior to download, including without limitation the Beta App's age rating, minimum hardware requirements, and the availability of items available for purchase within the Beta App (i.e. in-app purchases). By downloading a Beta App, you consent to using the Beta App without such information and disclosures.  \n\nYou acknowledge and agree that you will not be compensated for evaluating any Beta App or for any Beta Input, and you will bear all of your own costs from using TestFlight and any Beta Apps (e.g., mobile carrier and data costs). Further, you hereby acknowledge and agree that the content contained in, and your use of, any Beta App that is not already publicly available shall be considered confidential unless the Application Provider explicitly authorizes public disclosure. You agree to hold the Beta App in confidence and to treat it as confidential, e.g., not share it with others who do not have the Beta App installed.  \n\nIf you have a complaint about a Beta App, you should send it directly to the Application Provider. You acknowledge and agree that the Application Provider, not Apple, is fully responsible for any Beta App, unless Apple is the licensor of such Beta App.  \n\nBeta Testing Data and Beta Feedback  \n\nWhen you use a Beta App through TestFlight, Apple and the Application Provider will automatically collect crash logs and usage data (“Beta Testing Data”) and you may not opt-out of the collection of Beta Testing Data.  \n\nTestFlight will also provide you with the ability to submit written or visual feedback (e.g., screenshots and comments) about the Beta Apps to Apple and\/or Application Providers (“Beta Feedback”). If you submit Beta Feedback, you acknowledge and agree that you do so at your own initiative and that the Application Provider (including Apple, if it is Appleʼs Beta App) will have the right to use your Beta Feedback as set forth below. You represent to the Application Provider that you have all the necessary rights to give the Beta Feedback and to grant the rights to the Application Provider.  \n\nThe Application Provider may use the Beta Testing Data and Beta Feedback to improve their App and related products, and may contact you regarding your use of their Beta App. The Application Providerʼs use of Beta Testing Data and Beta Feedback is subject to limitations and requirements set forth by Apple in the Apple Developer Program License Agreement and to the Application Providerʼs Privacy Policy. Apple may use the Beta Testing Data to improve its products and services.  \n\nBeta Testing Data and Beta Feedback may include personally identifying information, including in the screenshots you provide, such as when a screenshot includes your photos or image and likeness, and information about your device, including but not limited to various unique device identifiers, hardware and operating system specifications, performance statistics, and data about how you use your device, system and application software, networking information, and peripherals. When you use TestFlight and the Beta App, details will be provided regarding what data is sent to Apple and the Application Provider, and how the information may be used. You can learn more by visiting https:\/\/testflight.apple.com\/#privacy-data . At all times, Apple will handle your information in accordance with our Privacy Policy, which can be viewed at https:\/\/www.apple.com\/legal\/privacy\/.  \n\nApple is committed to diversity and to providing a safe, harassment-free experience for everyone. Beta Feedback should be respectful and should not include offensive, malicious, or derogatory writing, images, or screenshots.  \n\nNO WARRANTY  \n\nYOU EXPRESSLY ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT USE OF TESTFLIGHT AND ANY BETA APP ACQUIRED VIA TESTFLIGHT IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK AND THAT THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO SATISFACTORY QUALITY, PERFORMANCE, ACCURACY, AND EFFORT IS WITH YOU. BETA APPS MAY HAVE SOFTWARE, SERVICE, AND OTHER ERRORS AND YOUR USE OF TESTFLIGHT AND\/OR BETA APPS DOWNLOADED VIA TESTFLIGHT MAY NOT BE CONTINUOUSLY AVAILABLE, ERROR FREE, OR FREE OF VIRUSES OR OTHER MALICIOUS CODE AND MAY NOT STORE DATA ACCURATELY OR AT ALL. FEATURES AND FUNCTIONALITY OF TESTFLIGHT AND BETA APPS DOWNLOADED VIA TESTFLIGHT ARE SUBJECT TO CHANGE AND MAY CEASE TO BE AVAILABLE TO YOU AT ANY TIME WITH OR WITHOUT NOTICE. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, TESTFLIGHT, BETA APPS ACQUIRED VIA TESTFLIGHT, AND ANY SERVICES PERFORMED OR PROVIDED BY TESTFLIGHT AND\/OR SUCH BETA APPS ARE PROVIDED “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE”, WITH ALL FAULTS AND WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, AND APPLE AND THE APPLICATION PROVIDER HEREBY DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS WITH RESPECT TO TESTFLIGHT, THE BETA APPS, AND ANY SERVICES, EITHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, OR STATUTORY, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES AND\/OR CONDITIONS OF MERCHANTABILITY, OF SATISFACTORY QUALITY, OF FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OF ACCURACY, OF QUIET ENJOYMENT, AND OF NONINFRINGEMENT OF THIRD-PARTY RIGHTS. APPLE AND THE APPLICATION PROVIDER DO NOT WARRANT AGAINST INTERFERENCE WITH YOUR ENJOYMENT OF TESTFLIGHT AND\/OR THE BETA APP, THAT THE FUNCTIONS CONTAINED IN OR SERVICES PERFORMED OR PROVIDED BY TESTFLIGHT AND\/OR THE BETA APP WILL MEET YOUR REQUIREMENTS, THAT THE OPERATION OF THE BETA APP OR TESTFLIGHT WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE, OR THAT DEFECTS IN THE BETA APP OR TESTFLIGHT WILL BE CORRECTED. NO ORAL OR WRITTEN INFORMATION OR ADVICE GIVEN BY APPLICATION PROVIDER OR ITS AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE SHALL CREATE A WARRANTY. SHOULD THE BETA APP OR TESTFLIGHT PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE ENTIRE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR, OR CORRECTION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES OR LIMITATIONS ON APPLICABLE STATUTORY RIGHTS OF A CONSUMER, SO THE ABOVE EXCLUSION AND LIMITATIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.  \n\nTermination  \n\nTo terminate your participation in beta-testing a particular Beta App, delete the Beta App from your device. Deleting the Beta App from your device will also delete any data you have generated within that Beta App, and may delete any data created in a previously installed full version of the App. Deleting the Beta App will not delete Beta Testing Data or Beta Input that you, TestFlight, or the Beta App have already provided to the Application Provider and Apple. To request deletion of your personal information, contact the Application Provider or Apple directly. Apple and\/or the Application Provider reserve the right to terminate your participation in the beta testing of any Beta App at any time, in their sole discretion. By way of example, this termination may occur if you provide Beta Feedback that contains offensive and inappropriate images to the Application Provider.  \n\n06\/21\/2023  \n\n(B) APPLE INC.  \n\nTESTFLIGHT SOFTWARE LICENSE AGREEMENT  \n\nTestFlight Application  \n\nPLEASE READ THIS SOFTWARE LICENSE AGREEMENT (“LICENSE”) CAREFULLY BEFORE USING THE APPLE SOFTWARE. ANY INSTALLATION AND\/OR USE OF THE APPLE SOFTWARE ON THIS DEVICE OR ON YOUR OTHER SUPPORTED APPLE-BRANDED DEVICES IS SUBJECT TO THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE, UNLESS ACCOMPANIED BY A SEPARATE LICENSE AGREEMENT. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE, DO NOT INSTALL AND\/OR USE THE SOFTWARE ON THIS DEVICE OR ON YOUR OTHER SUPPORTED APPLE-BRANDED DEVICES. THIS LICENSE SUPERSEDES ANY PRIOR VERSIONS OF THE LICENSE INTO WHICH YOU HAVE ENTERED.  \n\n1. General.  \n\nA. The Apple software, and any third-party software, documentation, interfaces, fonts and any data accompanying this License whether in read only memory, on any other media or in any other form (collectively the “Apple Software”) are licensed, not sold, to you by Apple Inc. (“Apple”) for use only under the terms of this License. Apple and\/or Apple’s licensors retain ownership of the Apple Software itself and reserve all rights not expressly granted to you.  \n\nB. Apple, at its discretion, may make available future upgrades or updates to the Apple Software for your compatible Apple-branded device. The Apple Software upgrades and updates, if any, may not necessarily include all existing software features or new features that Apple releases for newer or other models of macOS, iOS, tvOS, or other Apple-branded hardware. The terms of this License will govern any software upgrades or updates provided by Apple to the original Apple Software product, unless such upgrade or update is accompanied by a separate license in which case you agree that the terms of that license will govern such upgrade or update.  \n\n2. Permitted License Uses and Restrictions.  \n\nA. License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License and as permitted in the “Services and Content Usage Rules” set forth in the Apple Media Services Terms and Conditions (https:\/\/www.apple.com\/legal\/internet-services\/itunes\/), you are granted a limited, non-transferable, non-exclusive license to install and use the Apple Software on any compatible Apple-branded device that you own or control in accordance with the terms of Section 2B. You may not distribute or make the Apple Software available over a network where it could be used by multiple devices at the same time.

The Apple Software may allow you to access pre-release Apps from Apple and\/or third-party developers that may or may not be identified with a mark (e.g., a colored dot) when loaded onto your Apple-branded device (“Beta Apps”). Your use of the Beta Apps will be in accordance with the latest Apple Media Services Terms and Conditions for the country in which you access the App Store as well as the TestFlight Terms of Service and any other terms or license included by Apple or a third-party developer (if any). The TestFlight Terms of Service will be presented to you for review and acceptance prior to your use or download of any Beta Apps.  \n\nC. Limitations. You may not, and you agree not to or to enable others to, copy (except as expressly permitted by this License), decompile, reverse engineer, disassemble, attempt to derive the source code of, decrypt, modify, or create derivative works of the Apple Software or any part thereof (except as and only to the extent any foregoing restriction is prohibited by applicable law or to the extent as may be permitted by the licensing terms governing use of any open sourced components included with the Apple Software). You agree to use the Apple Software in compliance with all applicable laws, including local laws of the country or region in which you reside or in which you download or use the Apple Software.  \n\n3. Consent to Use of Data.  \n\nA. Analytics Data. If you opt in to Analytics collection for the Apple Software (the TestFlight Application), you agree that Apple and its subsidiaries and agents may collect, maintain, process and use diagnostic, technical, usage and related information, including but not limited to unique system or hardware identifiers, information about your device, computer, system and application software, and peripherals, that is gathered periodically to provide and improve Apple’s products and services, facilitate the provision of software updates, product support and other services to you (if any) related to the Apple Software, and to verify compliance with the terms of this License. Apple may use this information, as long as it is collected in a form that does not personally identify you, for the purposes described above. To enable Apple’s partners and third-party developers to improve their software, hardware and services designed for use with Apple products, Apple may also provide any such partner or third-party developer with a subset of diagnostic information that is relevant to that partner’s or developer’s software, hardware and\/or services, as long as the diagnostic information is in a form that does not personally identify you.  \n\nB. Privacy Policy. At all times your information will be treated in accordance with the terms of this License and as described in Apple’s Privacy Policy, which can be viewed at: https:\/\/www.apple.com\/legal\/privacy\/.  \n\n4. Pre-release Software.  \n\nNote: This Agreement applies to both commercial release and pre-release versions of the Apple Software, as applicable.  \n\nA. Using Pre-Release Apple Software. Pre-release versions of the Apple Software are time limited and meant for test and evaluation purposes only. Pre-release versions should not be relied upon to perform in the same manner as a final-release, commercial-grade product, nor should they be used with important data. Pre-release versions may contain inaccuracies or errors that could cause failures or loss of data and may be incomplete. Before installing any pre-release versions of the Apple Software, You should back up Your data and regularly back up your data while using.  \n\nB. Confidentiality. You agree that pre-release versions of the Apple Software will be deemed “Apple Confidential Information”; provided however that upon the commercial release of the Apple Software, such pre-release versions of the Apple Software will no longer be confidential. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Apple Confidential Information will not include: (i) information that is generally and legitimately available to the public through no fault or breach of Yours, (ii) information that is generally made available to the public by Apple, (iii) information that is independently developed by You without the use of any Apple Confidential Information, or (iv) information that was rightfully obtained from a third party who had the right to transfer or disclose it to You without limitation.  \n\nYou agree to protect Apple Confidential Information using at least the same degree of care that You use to protect Your own confidential information of similar importance, but no less than a reasonable degree of care. You agree to use Apple Confidential Information solely for the purpose of exercising Your rights and performing Your obligations under this Agreement and agree not to use Apple Confidential Information for any other purpose, for Your own or any third party’s benefit, without Apple's prior written consent. You may disclose Apple Confidential Information to the extent required by law, provided that You take reasonable steps to notify Apple of such requirement before disclosing the Apple Confidential Information and to obtain protective treatment of the Apple Confidential Information. You acknowledge that damages for improper disclosure of Apple Confidential Information may be irreparable; therefore, Apple is entitled to seek equitable relief, including injunction and preliminary injunction, in addition to all other remedies.  \n\n5. Termination. This License is effective until terminated. Your rights under this License will terminate automatically or otherwise cease to be effective without notice from Apple if you fail to comply with any term(s) of this License. Upon the termination of this License, you shall cease all use of the Apple Software and destroy all copies, full or partial, of the Apple Software. Sections 2C, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, and 11 of this License shall survive any such termination.  \n\n6. Disclaimer of Warranties.  \n\nA. YOU EXPRESSLY ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, USE OF THE APPLE SOFTWARE AS WELL AS ANY CONTENT OR APPS DISPLAYED BY OR ACCESSED THROUGH THE APPLE SOFTWARE (COLLECTIVELY, THE “APPLE SOFTWARE” FOR PURPOSES OF SECTION 5 AND 6) IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK AND THAT THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO SATISFACTORY QUALITY, PERFORMANCE, ACCURACY AND EFFORT IS WITH YOU.  \n\nB. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE APPLE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE”, WITH ALL FAULTS AND WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, AND APPLE AND APPLE’S LICENSORS (COLLECTIVELY REFERRED TO AS “APPLE” FOR THE PURPOSES OF SECTIONS 5 AND 6) HEREBY DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS WITH RESPECT TO THE APPLE SOFTWARE, EITHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR STATUTORY, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES AND\/OR CONDITIONS OF MERCHANTABILITY, SATISFACTORY QUALITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, ACCURACY, QUIET ENJOYMENT, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT OF THIRD-PARTY RIGHTS.  \n\nC.

INSTALLATION OF THIS SOFTWARE MAY AFFECT THE AVAILABILITY AND USABILITY OF THIRD PARTY SOFTWARE, APPLICATIONS OR THIRD PARTY SERVICES, AS WELL AS APPLE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES.  \n\nD. YOU FURTHER ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE APPLE SOFTWARE IS NOT INTENDED OR SUITABLE FOR USE IN SITUATIONS OR ENVIRONMENTS WHERE THE FAILURE OR TIME DELAYS OF, OR ERRORS OR INACCURACIES IN, THE CONTENT, DATA OR INFORMATION PROVIDED BY THE APPLE SOFTWARE COULD LEAD TO DEATH, PERSONAL INJURY, OR SEVERE PHYSICAL OR ENVIRONMENTAL DAMAGE, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION THE OPERATION OF NUCLEAR FACILITIES, AIRCRAFT NAVIGATION OR COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS, AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL, LIFE SUPPORT OR WEAPONS SYSTEMS.  \n\nE. NO ORAL OR WRITTEN INFORMATION OR ADVICE GIVEN BY APPLE OR AN APPLE AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE SHALL CREATE A WARRANTY. SHOULD THE APPLE SOFTWARE PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE ENTIRE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES OR LIMITATIONS ON APPLICABLE STATUTORY RIGHTS OF A CONSUMER, SO THE ABOVE EXCLUSION AND LIMITATIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.  \n\n7.

TO THE EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL APPLE BE LIABLE FOR PERSONAL INJURY, OR ANY INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, INDIRECT OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES WHATSOEVER, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF PROFITS, CORRUPTION OR LOSS OF DATA, FAILURE TO TRANSMIT OR RECEIVE ANY DATA OR INFORMATION, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION OR ANY OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO YOUR USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE APPLE SOFTWARE OR ANY THIRD-PARTY SOFTWARE OR APPLICATIONS IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE APPLE SOFTWARE, HOWEVER CAUSED, REGARDLESS OF THE THEORY OF LIABILITY (CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE) AND EVEN IF APPLE HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF LIABILITY FOR PERSONAL INJURY, OR OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. In no event shall Apple’s total liability to you for all damages (other than as may be required by applicable law in cases involving personal injury) exceed the amount of fifty dollars ($50.00).

IT IS IMPORTANT THAT YOU READ AND UNDERSTAND THE FOLLOWING TERMS. BY CLICKING “AGREE,” YOU ARE AGREEING THAT THESE TERMS WILL APPLY IF YOU CHOOSE TO ACCESS OR USE THE SERVICE.  \n\nApple is the provider of the Service, which permits you to utilize certain Internet services, including storing your personal content (such as contacts, calendars, photos, notes, reminders, documents, app data, and iCloud email) and making it accessible on your compatible devices and computers, and certain location based services, only under the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement. iCloud is automatically enabled when you are running devices on iOS 9 or later and sign in with your Apple ID during device setup, unless you are upgrading the device and have previously chosen not to enable iCloud. You can disable iCloud in Settings. When iCloud is enabled, your content will be automatically stored by Apple on Apple's or third party providers' servers, so you can later access that content or have content wirelessly pushed to your other iCloud-enabled devices or computers.   \n\nI. REQUIREMENTS FOR USE OF THE SERVICE  \n\n          A. Age. The Service is only available to individuals aged 13 years or older (or equivalent minimum age in the relevant jurisdiction), unless you are under 13 years old and your Apple ID was provided to you as a result of a request by an approved educational institution or established as part of the Family Sharing feature by your parent or guardian. We do not knowingly collect, use or disclose personal information from children under 13, or equivalent minimum age in the relevant jurisdiction, without verifiable parental consent.  Parents and guardians should also remind any minors that conversing with strangers on the Internet can be dangerous and take appropriate precautions to protect children, including monitoring their use of the Service.  \n\nTo use the Service, you cannot be a person barred from receiving the Service under the laws of the United States or other applicable jurisdictions, including the country in which you reside or from where you use the Service. By accepting this Agreement, you represent that you understand and agree to the foregoing.  \n\n          B. Devices and Accounts. Use of the Service may require compatible devices, Internet access, and certain software (fees may apply); may require periodic updates; and may be affected by the performance of these factors. Apple reserves the right to limit the number of iCloud accounts (\"Accounts\") that may be created from a device and the number of devices associated with an Account. The latest version of required software may be required for certain transactions or features. You agree that meeting these requirements is your responsibility.   \n\n          C. Limitations on Use.  You agree to use the Service only for purposes permitted by this Agreement, and only to the extent permitted by any applicable law, regulation, or generally accepted practice in the applicable jurisdiction. Your Account is allocated 5GB of storage capacity as described in the iCloud feature pages. Additional storage is available for purchase, as described below. Exceeding any applicable or reasonable limitation of bandwidth, or storage capacity (for example, backup or email account space) is prohibited and may prevent you from backing up to iCloud, adding documents, or receiving new email sent to your iCloud email address. If your use of the Service or other behavior intentionally or unintentionally threatens Apple’s ability to provide the Service or other systems, Apple shall be entitled to take all reasonable steps to protect the Service and Apple’s systems, which may include suspension of your access to the Service. Repeated violations of the limitations may result in termination of your Account.  \n\nIf you are a covered entity, business associate or representative of a covered entity or business associate (as those terms are defined at 45 C.F.R § 160.103), You agree that you will not use any component, function or other facility of iCloud to create, receive, maintain or transmit any “protected health information” (as such term is defined at 45 C.F.R § 160.103) or use iCloud in any manner that would make Apple (or any Apple Subsidiary) your or any third party’s business associate.  \n\n          D. Availability of the Service. The Service, or any feature or part thereof, may not be available in all languages or in all countries and Apple makes no representation that the Service, or any feature or part thereof, is appropriate or available for use in any particular location. To the extent you choose to access and use the Service, you do so at your own initiative and are responsible for compliance with any applicable laws.  \n\n          E. Changing the Service.  Apple reserves the right at any time to modify this Agreement and to impose new or additional terms or conditions on your use of the Service, provided that Apple will give you 30 days’ advance notice of any material adverse change to the Service or applicable terms of service, unless it would not be reasonable to do so due to circumstances arising from legal, regulatory, or governmental action; to address user security, user privacy, or technical integrity concerns; to avoid service disruptions to other users; or due to a natural disaster, catastrophic event, war, or other similar occurrence outside of Apple’s reasonable control. With respect to paid iCloud services, e.g. iCloud+ as defined below, Apple will not make any material adverse change to the Service before the end of your current paid term, unless a change is reasonably necessary to address legal, regulatory, or governmental action; to address user security, user privacy, or technical integrity concerns; to avoid service disruptions to other users; or to avoid issues resulting from a natural disaster, a catastrophic event, war, or other similar occurrence outside of Apple’s reasonable control. In the event that Apple does make material adverse changes to the Service or terms of use, you will have the right to terminate this Agreement and your account, in which case Apple will provide you with a pro rata refund of any pre-payment for your then-current paid term. Apple shall not be liable to you for any modifications to the Service or terms of service made in accordance with this Section IE.  \n\nII. FEATURES AND SERVICES  \n\n          A. Photos  \n\n            1.  iCloud Photos. When you enable iCloud Photos, your photos, videos, metadata and any edits that you make in the Photos App on your iOS device, macOS computer, or Windows PC will be automatically uploaded and stored in iCloud, and then pushed to all of your other iCloud Photos-enabled devices and computers. The photo and video resolution may vary depending on your device settings and available storage.  You may download full resolution photos and videos at any time.  \n\n            2. Shared Albums.  When you use Shared Albums, Apple stores any photos and videos you share until you delete them. You can access your shared photos and videos from any of your Apple devices that have Shared Albums enabled. People you invite to shared albums may view, save, copy, and share these photos and videos, as well as contribute photos and videos, and comments.  If you choose to use Shared Albums to share photos via a web link, these photos will be publicly available to anyone who has been provided or has access to the web link. If you want to stop sharing individual photos, videos, comments or entire Shared Albums, you may delete them at any time.  However, any content previously copied from a Shared Album to another device or computer will not be deleted.    \n\n            3. Shared Photo Library.  If you have iCloud Photos enabled, you can create or join one Shared Library with up to five other people.  When you contribute photos and videos to a Shared Photo Library, they move out of your Personal Library and into the Shared Library. All participants have equal permissions to add, edit, and delete content in the Shared Library. The participants in the Shared Library all have access to the Shared Library content but the Shared Library content only counts against the iCloud Storage quota of the person who created the Shared Library.  If the library owner runs out of iCloud storage, content can no longer be added to the Shared Library and changes such as edits, favorites, and metadata adjustments no longer sync.  Users who are under 13 (or equivalent minimum age in the relevant jurisdiction) with an Apple ID established by a parent or guardian can only participate in a Shared Photo Library with other Family members.  \n\n          B. Folder and File Sharing. When you use iCloud Folder and File Sharing, Apple stores any files you share until you delete them.  You can access your shared files from any of your Apple devices with iCloud Drive enabled. You may give access to people to view, save, copy or edit these files.  You have the option to give people the right to edit the files or to only view them.  If you use iCloud Folder and File Sharing to share files via a web link, these files will be publicly accessible to anyone who has been provided the web link.  You can stop sharing files at any time.  If you stop sharing, files will be removed from iCloud Drive on everyone’s devices. However, any file previously copied to another device or computer will not be deleted.  \n\n          C. Mail Drop. If you are logged in to iCloud and you use the macOS Mail app or iCloud Mail on the web to send emails with large attachments, you will have the option of using Mail Drop.  With Mail Drop, your large attachments will be temporarily stored on iCloud servers in order to facilitate their delivery. Apple will either send a link or a preview of the attachment to recipients, depending on your recipient’s email client application. Temporary storage of large email attachments will not count towards your iCloud storage quota. For more information about Mail Drop, please go to https:\/\/support.apple.com\/en-us\/HT203093.   \n\n          D. Third Party Apps. If you sign in to certain third party apps with your iCloud credentials, you agree to allow that app to store data in your personal iCloud account and for Apple to collect, store and process such data on behalf of the relevant third-party app developer in association with your use of the Service and such apps. The data that the app stores in your personal iCloud account will count towards your storage limit.  Such data may be shared with another app that you download from the same app developer.   \n\n          E. Family Sharing. With Family Sharing, you can share certain purchased content such as Store purchases and Apple subscriptions with members of your family. You may also share certain content such as photos, calendars, location, and screen time information depending on what your family chooses to share.  You may also share certain subscriptions and in-app purchases from third parties.  For more information regarding sharing your content purchases, please see the Apple Media Services Terms and Conditions at https:\/\/www.apple.com\/legal\/internet-services\/itunes\/ww\/.  For more information about sharing content, device usage and location information with family members, please see https:\/\/www.apple.com\/family-sharing\/.  \n\n          F. iCloud Web-Only Account.  If you sign up for the Service with a web-only account on a non-Apple-branded device or computer, you will have access to only a limited set of Service functionality. You will receive 1 GB of free storage and you will not be able to increase this amount with a web-only account. As a condition to accessing the Service with a web-only account, you agree to all relevant terms and conditions found in this Agreement, including, without limitation, all requirements for use of the Service, limitations on use, availability, public beta, disclaimers of warranties, rules regarding your content and conduct, and termination. Terms found in this Agreement relating to features not available for web-only users will not be applicable to you. These include, for example, use of location based services and payment of fees for iCloud storage upgrades. You further agree that if you subsequently access your web-only account from an Apple-branded device or Apple-branded computer, whether or not you own such device or computer, Apple may automatically upgrade your web-only account to a full iCloud account and provide all available functionality of the Service to you, including increased free storage capacity. If you choose to access your web-only account from an Apple-branded device or Apple-branded computer and you are subsequently upgraded to full functionality of the Service, you agree that all of the terms and conditions contained herein apply to your use of the Service. If you do not want to have a full iCloud account, do not sign in to your web-only account from an Apple-branded device or computer.  \n\n          G. iCloud+.  iCloud+ is a premium iCloud Subscription that includes access to additional storage and certain premium features (“iCloud+”).  The subscription plans for iCloud+ are iCloud+ Subscriptions.  Depending on the requirements of your location, you can obtain some or all of the following iCloud+ features if you have an iCloud+ Subscription or someone in your Family Sharing group has an iCloud+ Subscription and shares it with you:  \n\n            1. Private Relay.  Private Relay allows you to connect to and browse the web more privately and securely by encrypting your internet traffic and sending it through at least two internet relays.  When using Private Relay some websites may not behave as expected, for example by showing content for the wrong region or requiring extra steps to sign in.  You can enable or disable Private Relay from iCloud Settings at any time. Additionally, Private Relay may impact your internet provider’s ability to exempt your data usage from data caps and may result in additional charges from your internet provider.  Private Relay may be initially available as a beta and, if so, it is a Beta Feature subject to the provisions of Section VI.C. (Public Beta).  \n\n             2. Hide My Email.  Hide My Email allows you to generate unique, random email addresses that will forward onto an email address of your choosing.  Apple reserves the right to limit the number of email addresses available under this feature, or to terminate the use of an alias if the use violates the terms and conditions as set forth herein.    \n\n             3. HomeKit Secure Video.  HomeKit Secure Video in iCloud+ allows you to store video from compatible home security cameras in iCloud and view your footage remotely.  HomeKit Secure Video requires a supported iCloud+ plan, compatible HomeKit-enabled security camera, and HomePod, Apple TV, or iPad running as a home hub.  Certain iCloud+ plans may limit the number of cameras or video streams available to you.    \n\n             4. Custom Email Domains.  You can personalize your iCloud Mail address with a custom domain name (when available) and invite members of your family to use the same domain with their iCloud Mail accounts.  Each person can have up to three email addresses per domain.  Mail stored in iCloud counts toward your iCloud storage. If you run out of iCloud storage space, you will not be able to receive new messages at your custom email addresses until you make more storage space available.  Apple reserves the right to refuse to personalize your iCloud Mail address with a custom domain name that is unlawful, harassing, threatening, harmful, tortious, defamatory, libelous, abusive, violent, obscene, vulgar, invasive of another’s privacy, hateful, racially or ethnically offensive, or otherwise objectionable.    \n\nSome iCloud+ features are not available in all countries or regions.    \n\n          H. Two-Factor Authentication and Autodialed Calls\/Texts. If you choose to enable Two-Factor Authentication for your Apple ID, you consent to (a) provide Apple at least one telephone number; and (b) receive autodialed or prerecorded calls and text messages from Apple at any of the telephone numbers provided. We may place such calls or texts to (i) help keep your Account secure when signing in; (ii) help you access your Account when you’ve forgotten your password; or (iii) as otherwise necessary to service your Account or enforce this Agreement, our policies, applicable law, or any other agreement we may have with you.  \n\n          I. Help with Account Recovery.  You can add one or more people as a recovery contact who can use their device to generate a code that can help you regain access to your account and data.  The recovery contact must be over 13 years old (or equivalent minimum age in the relevant jurisdiction), have an Apple ID, two factor authentication, and an Apple device with device passcode enabled.  They will not be able to get direct access to your account.  It is your responsibility to keep your recovery contacts up to date.   \n\n          J. Advanced Data Protection. With Advanced Data Protection, you can enable the use of end-to-end encryption to further protect additional categories of your data in iCloud, including your iCloud Backup, Photos, Notes, and files stored in iCloud Drive. To enable Advanced Data Protection, you must have two-factor authentication enabled for your Apple ID and a trusted device (devices on which you have signed into your Account using two-factor authentication) for that account with passcode or password enabled.  In addition, you will also be required to generate a recovery key or designate at least one account recovery contact to help you regain access to your Account and data in the event you forget your Account password, do not have access to any of your trusted devices, and you have forgotten your device passcodes or passwords. You can change your recovery contacts at any time, but they must be over 13 years old (or equivalent minimum age where the recovery contact resides), have an Apple ID with two-factor authentication enabled, and have an Apple device set with a passcode or a password.  Apple will not be able to help you recover data protected using Advanced Data Protection once it has been enabled, so it is your responsibility to keep your recovery key safe and\/or your recovery contacts up to date.  Apple shall bear no responsibility for your inability to access your account or data related to a failure to safeguard your recovery key or if your recovery contact is unable or unwilling to help you regain access to your Account and data. Managed Apple IDs and Child accounts are ineligible for Advanced Data Protection. You may turn off Advanced Data Protection at any time.  \n\n          K.  Security Keys. Security Keys allows you to require a physical security key to be used to sign in with your Apple ID. Security Keys requires that you have two-factor authentication enabled for your Apple ID, and that you use a FIDO certified third party security key as one of your two factors.  Security Keys allows you to use a trusted device to add a new key or turn off Security Keys altogether to preserve access to your account. However, if you have lost all of your security keys as well as your trusted devices, you will lose access to your account permanently and Apple will not be able to help you regain access to your account or data. Apple shall bear no responsibility for your inability to access your account or data related to a failure to safeguard your physical security keys or if your physical security keys malfunction.  Managed Apple IDs and child accounts are ineligible for Security Keys.  \n\n          L. Digital Legacy.  With Digital Legacy, you can choose to add one or more contacts to access and download certain data in your account after your death.  If your designated contacts provide proof of death to Apple and have the required key, they will automatically obtain access to that certain account data and activation lock will be removed from all your devices.  Thus, it is your responsibility to keep your Digital Legacy contacts up to date.  You can learn more about Digital Legacy at http:\/\/support.apple.com\/HT212360 and  http:\/\/support.apple.com\/HT212361.      \n\n          M. Use of Location-Based Services  \n\nApple and its partners and licensors may provide certain features or services that rely upon device-based location information using GPS (or similar technology, where available) and crowdsourced Wi-Fi access points and cell tower locations. To provide such features or services, where available, Apple and its partners and licensors must collect, use, transmit, process and maintain your location data, including but not limited to the geographic location of your device and information related to your Account and any devices registered thereunder, including but not limited to your Apple ID, device ID and name, and device type.   \n\nYou may withdraw consent to Apple and its partners’ and licensors’ collection, use, transmission, processing and maintenance of location and Account data at any time by not using the location-based features and turning off Find My (including the predecessor apps Find My iPhone and Find My Friends, collectively referred to as “Find My”), or Location Services in Settings (as applicable) on your device. When using third party services that use or provide location data as part of the Service, you are subject to and should review such third party’s terms and privacy policy on use of location data by such third party services. Any location data provided by the Service is not intended to be relied upon in situations where precise location information is needed or where erroneous, inaccurate, time-delayed or incomplete location data may lead to death, personal injury, property or environmental damage. Apple shall use reasonable skill and due care in providing the Service, but neither Apple nor any of its service and\/or content providers guarantees the availability, accuracy, completeness, reliability, or timeliness of location data or any other data displayed by the Service. LOCATION-BASED SERVICES ARE NOT INTENDED OR SUITABLE FOR USE AS AN EMERGENCY LOCATOR SYSTEM.  \n\n          N. Find My   \n\nWhen you enable iCloud and Location Services on a device running iOS 13, iPad OS or macOS Catalina or later, Find My (Find My iPhone for devices running iOS 8 through iOS 12) will be enabled automatically on that device and any Apple accessories paired with it.  Once enabled, your device will be automatically linked to your Apple ID and your Apple ID password will be required before anyone (including you) can turn off Find My, sign out of iCloud, erase or activate the device.  Apple and its authorized agents may not perform hardware or software support services, including services under Apple’s limited warranty, unless you disable Find My prior to service.  Apple shall bear no responsibility for your failure to protect your iOS device with a passcode, enable Lost Mode, and\/or receive or respond to notices and communications.  Apple shall also bear no responsibility for returning your iOS device to you or for any loss of data on your iOS device.  \n\nFind My Network is a crowdsourcing feature that can help you and others locate missing devices when those devices are not connected to the internet. If Find My Network is enabled on a device, it can detect the presence of nearby offline devices via Bluetooth (or similar technologies). If a device detects a missing offline device, it will use Wi-Fi or cellular connections to securely report the approximate location of the device back to the Apple ID associated with the device so the owner can view its location in the Find My app. Location reporting is end-to-end encrypted, and Apple cannot see the location of the reporting device or any offline device. You can disable Find My Network in Settings.  \n\n          O. Backup  \n\niCloud Backup periodically creates automatic backups for iOS devices, when the device is screen locked, connected to a power source, and connected to the Internet via a Wi-Fi network. If a device has not backed up to iCloud for a period of one hundred and eighty (180) days, Apple reserves the right to delete any backups associated with that device. Backup may include device settings, device characteristics, photos and videos, documents, your messages, ringtones, Health app data and other app data. For additional information, please go to https:\/\/support.apple.com\/en-us\/HT207428.  The following content is not included in your iCloud backup: content purchased from the iTunes Store, App Store, or Apple Books, media synced from your computer, and your photo library if you have enabled iCloud Photo Library. Apple shall use reasonable skill and due care in providing the Service, but, TO THE GREATEST EXTENT PERMISSIBLE BY APPLICABLE LAW, APPLE DOES NOT GUARANTEE OR WARRANT THAT ANY CONTENT YOU MAY STORE OR ACCESS THROUGH THE SERVICE WILL NOT BE SUBJECT TO INADVERTENT DAMAGE, CORRUPTION, LOSS, OR REMOVAL IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT, AND APPLE SHALL NOT BE RESPONSIBLE SHOULD SUCH DAMAGE, CORRUPTION, LOSS, OR REMOVAL OCCUR. It is your responsibility to maintain appropriate alternate backup of your information and data.  \n\nIII. SUBSCRIPTION UPGRADES  \n\nThe iCloud+ Subscription plans are available for purchase on a subscription basis.  \n\n          A. Payment  \n\nBy you upgrading to the iCloud+ Subscription service for more storage and additional features, Apple will automatically charge on a recurring basis the fee for the plan you choose, including any applicable taxes, to the payment method associated with your Apple ID (e.g., the payment method you use to shop on the iTunes Store, App Store, or Apple Books, if available) or the payment method associated with your Family account. For details about plans and pricing, please visit https:\/\/support.apple.com\/en-us\/HT201238.  If you are a Family organizer, you agree to have Apple charge your payment method on a recurring basis for members of your Family who upgrade their plan. Apple may also obtain preapproval for an amount up to the amount of the transaction and contact you periodically by email to the email address associated with your Apple ID for billing reminders and other subscription account-related communications.    \n\nYou can change your subscription by upgrading or downgrading your plan under the iCloud section of Settings on your device, or under the iCloud pane of System Preferences on your Mac or iCloud for Windows on your PC.  \n\nThe applicable fee for an upgraded plan will take effect immediately; downgrades to your plan will take effect on the next annual or monthly billing date. YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE TIMELY PAYMENT OF ALL FEES AND FOR PROVIDING APPLE WITH VALID CREDIT CARD OR PAYMENT ACCOUNT DETAILS FOR PAYMENT OF ALL FEES. If Apple is unable to successfully charge your credit card or payment account for fees due, Apple reserves the right to revoke or restrict access to your stored content, delete your stored content, or terminate your Account. If you want to designate a different credit card or payment account or if there is a change in your credit card or payment account status, you must change your information online in the Account Information section of iCloud; this may temporarily disrupt your access to the Services while Apple verifies your new payment information. We may contact you via email regarding your account, for reasons including, without limitation, reaching or exceeding your storage limit of your selected plan.   \n\nIf you are in Brazil, notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary:  \n\nFor any charges made by Apple to you, Apple may use an affiliated company to perform activities of collection and remittances to charge any amounts owed by you in connection with your iCloud account.  In addition, your total price will include the price of the upgrade plus any applicable credit card fees. You are responsible for any taxes applicable to you except for any applicable withholding taxes which shall be collected by Apple’s affiliated company. You must provide all account information required by Apple to enable such transactions. You acknowledge and agree that if you do not provide all required account information, Apple shall have the right to terminate your account.   \n\n          B. Right of Withdrawal  \n\nIf you choose to cancel your subscription following its initial purchase or, if you are on an annual payment plan, following the commencement of any renewal term, you may do so by informing Apple with a clear statement (see applicable address details in section “General” below) within 14 days from when you received your e-mail confirmation by contacting Customer Support. You do not need to provide a reason for cancellation.   \n\nTo meet the cancellation deadline, you must send your communication of cancellation before the 14-day period has expired.   \n\nCustomers in the EU and Norway also have the right to inform us using the model cancellation form below:  \n\nTo:  Apple Distribution International Ltd., Hollyhill Industrial Estate, Hollyhill, Cork, Republic of Ireland:  \n\nI hereby give notice that I withdraw from my contract for the following:   \n\n[SUBSCRIPTION PLAN AND PERIOD, e.g., 200 GB MONTHLY iCLOUD+ SUBSCRIPTION PLAN UPGRADE]  \n\nOrdered on [INSERT DATE]   \n\nName of consumer  \n\nAddress of consumer  \n\nDate   \n\nEffects of cancellation   \n\nWe will reduce your storage back to 5 GB and reimburse you no later than 14 days from the day on which we receive your cancellation notice. If you have used more than 5GB of storage during this period, you may not be able to create any more iCloud backups or use certain features until you have reduced your storage. We will use the same means of payment as you used for the transaction, and you will not incur any fees for such reimbursement.   \n\nIV. Your Use of the Service  \n\n          A. Your Account  \n\nAs a registered user of the Service, you must establish an Account. Don’t reveal your Account information to anyone else. You are solely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality and security of your Account and for all activities that occur on or through your Account, and you agree to immediately notify Apple of any security breach of your Account. You further acknowledge and agree that the Service is designed and intended for personal use on an individual basis and you should not share your Account and\/or password details with another individual. Provided we have exercised reasonable skill and due care, Apple shall not be responsible for any losses arising out of the unauthorized use of your Account resulting from you not following these rules.  \n\nIn order to use the Service, you must enter your Apple ID and password to authenticate your Account. You agree to provide accurate and complete information when you register with, and as you use, the Service (“Service Registration Data”), and you agree to update your Service Registration Data to keep it accurate and complete. Failure to provide accurate, current and complete Service Registration Data may result in the suspension and\/or termination of your Account. You agree that Apple may store and use the Service Registration Data you provide for use in maintaining and billing fees to your Account.  \n\n          B. Use of Other Apple Products and Services  \n\nParticular components or features of the Service provided by Apple and\/or its licensors, including but not limited to the ability to download previous purchases and iTunes Match and\/or iCloud Music Library (additional fees apply), require separate software or other license agreements or terms of use. You must read, accept, and agree to be bound by any such separate agreement as a condition of using these particular components or features of the Service.  \n\n          C. No Conveyance  \n\nNothing in this Agreement shall be construed to convey to you any interest, title, or license in an Apple ID, email address, domain name, iChat ID, or similar resource used by you in connection with the Service.  \n\n          D. No Right of Survivorship  \n\nExcept as allowed under Digital Legacy and unless otherwise required by law, you agree that your Account is non-transferable and that any rights to your Apple ID or content within your Account terminate upon your death. Upon receipt of a copy of a death certificate your Account may be terminated and all content within your Account deleted. Contact iCloud Support at https:\/\/support.apple.com\/icloud for further assistance.  \n\n          E. No Resale of Service  \n\nYou agree that you will not reproduce, copy, duplicate, sell, resell, rent or trade the Service (or any part thereof) for any purpose.  \n\nV. Content and Your Conduct  \n\n          A.

You understand and agree that your participation in the Program is voluntary and does not create a legal partnership, agency, or employment relationship between you and Apple, and that Apple is not obligated to provide you with any Beta Features. Apple may make such Beta Features available to Program participants by online registration or enrollment via the Service. You understand and agree that Apple may collect and use information from your Account, devices and peripherals in order to enroll you in a Program and\/or determine your eligibility to participate. You understand that once you enroll in a Program you may be unable to revert to the earlier non-beta version of a given Beta Feature. In the event such reversion is possible, you may not be able to migrate data created within the Beta Feature back to the earlier non-beta version. Your use of the Beta Features and participation in the Program is governed by this Agreement and any additional license terms that may separately accompany the Beta Features. The Beta Features are provided on an “AS IS” and “AS AVAILABLE” basis and may contain errors or inaccuracies that could cause failures, corruption or loss of data and\/or information from your device and from peripherals (including, without limitation, servers and computers) connected thereto. Apple strongly encourages you to backup all data and information on your device and any peripherals prior to participating in any Program. You expressly acknowledge and agree that all use of the Beta Features is at your sole risk. YOU ASSUME ALL RISKS AND ALL COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH YOUR PARTICIPATION IN ANY PROGRAM, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY INTERNET ACCESS FEES, BACKUP EXPENSES, COSTS INCURRED FOR THE USE OF YOUR DEVICE AND PERIPHERALS, AND ANY DAMAGE TO ANY EQUIPMENT, SOFTWARE, INFORMATION OR DATA.

Apple reserves the right to modify the terms, conditions or policies of the Program (including ceasing the Program) at any time with or without notice, and may revoke your participation in the Program at any time. You acknowledge that Apple has no obligation to provide a commercial version of the Beta Features, and that should such a commercial version be made available, it may have features or functionality different than that contained in the Beta Features. As part of the Program, Apple will provide you with the opportunity to submit comments, suggestions, or other feedback regarding your use of the Beta Features. You agree that in the absence of a separate written agreement to the contrary, Apple will be free to use any feedback you provide for any purpose.  \n\n          D. Export Control.

By using the Software or Service, you represent and warrant that you are not located in any such country or on any such list. You also agree that you will not use the Software or Service for any purposes prohibited by United States law, including, without limitation, the development, design, manufacture or production of missiles, nuclear, chemical or biological weapons.

In order to continue your use of the Service, such updates may be automatically downloaded and installed onto your device or computer. These updates may include bug fixes, feature enhancements or improvements, or entirely new versions of the Software.   \n\nVII. Termination  \n\n          A. Voluntary Termination by You  \n\nYou may delete your Apple ID and\/or stop using the Service at any time. If you wish to stop using iCloud on your device, you may disable iCloud from a device by opening Settings on your device, tapping iCloud, and tapping ”Sign Out”. To terminate your Account and delete your Apple ID, contact Apple Support at https:\/\/support.apple.com\/contact. If you terminate your Account and delete your Apple ID, you will not have access to other Apple or third party products and services that you set up with that Apple ID. This action may be non-reversible. Any fees paid by you prior to your termination are nonrefundable (except as expressly permitted otherwise by this Agreement), including any fees paid in advance for the billing year during which you terminate. Termination of your Account shall not relieve you of any obligation to pay any accrued fees or charges.  \n\n          B. Termination by Apple  \n\nApple may at any time, under certain circumstances and without prior notice, immediately terminate or suspend all or a portion of your Account and\/or access to the Service. Cause for such termination shall include: (a) violations of this Agreement or any other policies or guidelines that are referenced herein and\/or posted on the Service; (b) a request by you to cancel or terminate your Account; (c) a request and\/or order from law enforcement, a judicial body, or other government agency; (d) where provision of the Service to you is or may become unlawful; (e) unexpected technical or security issues or problems; (f) your participation in fraudulent or illegal activities; or (g) failure to pay any fees owed by you in relation to the Service, provided that in the case of non-material breach, Apple will be permitted to terminate only after giving you 30 days’ notice and only if you have not cured the breach within such 30-day period. Any such termination or suspension shall be made by Apple in its sole discretion and Apple will not be responsible to you or any third party for any damages that may result or arise out of such termination or suspension of your Account and\/or access to the Service. In addition, Apple may terminate your Account upon 30 days’ prior notice via email to the address associated with your Account if (a) your Account has been inactive for one (1) year; or (b) there is a general discontinuance of the Service or any part thereof. Notice of general discontinuance of service will be provided as set forth herein, unless it would not be reasonable to do so due to circumstances arising from legal, regulatory, or governmental action; to address user security, user privacy, or technical integrity concerns; to avoid service disruptions to other users; or due to a natural disaster, a catastrophic event, war, or other similar occurrence outside of Apple’s reasonable control. In the event of such termination, Apple will provide you with a pro rata refund of any pre-payment for your then-current paid term. Apple shall not be liable to you for any modifications to the Service or terms of service in accordance with this Section VIIB.  \n\n          C. Effects of Termination  \n\nUpon termination of your Account you may lose all access to the Service and any portions thereof, including, but not limited to, your Account, Apple ID, email account, and Content. In addition, after a period of time, Apple will delete information and data stored in or as a part of your account(s). Any individual components of the Service that you may have used subject to separate software license agreements will also be terminated in accordance with those license agreements.  \n\nVIII. Links and Other Third Party Materials  \n\nCertain Content, components or features of the Service may include materials from third parties and\/or hyperlinks to other web sites, resources or Content. Because Apple may have no control over such third party sites and\/or materials, you acknowledge and agree that Apple is not responsible for the availability of such sites or resources, and does not endorse or warrant the accuracy of any such sites or resources, and shall in no way be liable or responsible for any Content, advertising, products or materials on or available from such sites or resources. You further acknowledge and agree that Apple shall not be responsible or liable in any way for any damages you incur or allege to have incurred, either directly or indirectly, as a result of your use and\/or reliance upon any such Content, advertising, products or materials on or available from such sites or resources.  \n\nIX.

INTRODUCTION  \n\nThis Agreement governs your use of Apple’s services (“Services” – e.g., and where available, App Store, Apple Arcade, Apple Books, Apple Fitness+, Apple Music, Apple News, Apple News+, Apple One, Apple Podcasts, Apple Podcasts Subscriptions, Apple TV, Apple TV+, Apple TV Channels, Game Center, iTunes), through which you can buy, get, license, rent or subscribe to content, Apps (as defined below), and other in-app services (collectively, “Content”). Content may be offered through the Services by Apple or a third party. Our Services are available for your use in your country or territory of residence (“Home Country”). By creating an account for use of the Services in a particular country or territory you are specifying it as your Home Country. To use our Services, you need compatible hardware, software (latest version recommended and sometimes required) and Internet access (fees may apply). Our Services’ performance may be affected by these factors.  \n\nB. PAYMENTS, TAXES, AND REFUNDS  \n\nYou can acquire Content on our Services for free or for a charge, either of which is referred to as a “Transaction.” Each Transaction is an electronic contract between you and Apple, and\/or you and the entity providing the Content on our Services. However, if you are a customer of Apple Distribution International Ltd., then Apple Distribution International Ltd. is the merchant of record for some Content you acquire from Apple Books, Apple Podcasts, or App Store as displayed on the product page and\/or during the acquisition process for the relevant Service. In such case, you acquire the Content from Apple Distribution International Ltd., which is licensed by the Content provider (e.g., App Provider (as defined below), book publisher, etc.). When you make your first Transaction, we will ask you to choose how frequently we should ask for your password for future Transactions. On applicable hardware, if you enable Touch ID for Transactions, we will ask you to authenticate all Transactions with your fingerprint, and if you enable Face ID for Transactions, we will ask you to authenticate all Transactions using facial recognition. Manage your password settings at any time by following these instructions: https:\/\/support.apple.com\/HT204030.   \n\nApple will charge your selected payment method for any paid Transactions, including any applicable taxes. If you have also added it to your Apple Wallet, Apple may charge your selected payment method in Apple Wallet using Apple Pay. You can associate multiple payment methods with your Apple ID, and you agree that Apple may store and charge those payment methods for Transactions. Your primary payment method appears at the top of your account settings payments page.   \n\nIf your primary payment method cannot be charged for any reason (such as expiration or insufficient funds), you authorize Apple to attempt to charge your other eligible payment methods in order from top to bottom as they appear on your account settings payments page. If we cannot charge you, you remain responsible for any uncollected amounts, and we may attempt to charge you again or request that you provide another payment method. If you pre-order Content, you will be charged when the Content is delivered to you (unless you cancel prior to the Content’s availability). In accordance with local law, Apple may automatically update your payment information regarding your payment methods if provided such information by the payment networks or your financial institutions. Terms related to store credit and gift cards\/codes are available here: https:\/\/www.apple.com\/legal\/internet-services\/itunes\/giftcards\/. For more details about how Transactions are billed, please visit http:\/\/support.apple.com\/HT201359. All Transactions are final. Content prices may change at any time. If technical problems prevent or unreasonably delay delivery of Content, your exclusive and sole remedy is either replacement of the Content or refund of the price paid, as determined by Apple. From time to time, Apple may suspend or cancel payment or refuse a refund request if we find evidence of fraud, abuse, or unlawful or other manipulative behavior that entitles Apple to a corresponding counterclaim.   \n\nC. ACCOUNT   \n\nUsing our Services and accessing your Content may require an Apple ID. An Apple ID is the account you use across Apple’s ecosystem. Use of Game Center is subject to this Agreement and also requires a Game Center account. Your account is valuable, and you are responsible for maintaining its confidentiality and security. Apple is not responsible for any losses arising from the unauthorized use of your account. Please contact Apple if you suspect that your account has been compromised.  \n\nYou must be age thirteen (13) (or equivalent minimum age in your Home Country, as set forth in the Apple ID creation process) to create an account and use our Services. Apple IDs for persons under this age can be created by a parent or legal guardian using Family Sharing or by an approved educational institution, though certain devices may prevent such Apple IDs from accessing certain Services on the device. A parent or legal guardian who is creating an account for a minor should review this Agreement with the minor to ensure that they both understand it.     \n\nYou may add, notify, or remove a Legacy Contact for your Apple ID as described in http:\/\/support.apple.com\/HT212360. A Legacy Contact’s access to your Apple ID is limited as described in http:\/\/support.apple.com\/HT212361.   \n\nD. PRIVACY  \n\nYour use of our Services is subject to Apple’s Privacy Policy, which is available at https:\/\/www.apple.com\/legal\/privacy\/.  \n\nE. SERVICES AND CONTENT USAGE RULES  \n\nYour use of the Services and Content must follow the rules set forth in this section (“Usage Rules”). Any other use of the Services and Content is a material breach of this Agreement. Apple may monitor your use of the Services and Content to ensure that you are following these Usage Rules.  \n\nAll Services:  \n\n- You may use the Services and Content only for personal, noncommercial purposes (except as set forth in the App Store Content section below or as otherwise specified by Apple).  \n\n- Apple’s delivery of Services or Content does not transfer any commercial or promotional use rights to you, and does not constitute a grant or waiver of any rights of the copyright owners.  \n\n- You can use Content from up to five (5) different Apple IDs on each device.  \n\n- For any Service, you can have up to ten (10) devices (but only a maximum of five (5) computers) signed in with your Apple ID at one time, though simultaneous streams or downloads of Content may be limited to a lower number of devices as set out below under Apple Music and Apple TV content. Each computer must also be authorized using the same Apple ID (to learn more about authorization of computers, visit https:\/\/support.apple.com\/HT201251). Devices can be associated with a different Apple ID once every ninety (90) days.  \n\n- You may not manipulate play counts, downloads, ratings, or reviews via any means — such as (i) using a bot, script, or automated process; or (ii) providing or accepting any kind of compensation or incentive.  \n\n- You may not use any software, device, automated process, or any similar or equivalent manual process to scrape, copy, or perform measurement, analysis, or monitoring of, any portion of the Content or Services.  \n\n- It is your responsibility not to lose, destroy, or damage Content once downloaded. We encourage you to back up your Content regularly.  \n\n- You may not tamper with or circumvent any security technology included with the Services or Content.  \n\n- You may access our Services only using Apple’s software, and may not modify or use modified versions of such software.  \n\n- Video Content requires an HDCP connection.  \n\nAudio and Video Content Sales and Rentals:  \n\n- You can use Digital Rights Management (DRM)-free Content on a reasonable number of compatible devices that you own or control. DRM-protected Content can be used on up to five (5) computers and any number of devices that you sync to from those computers.   \n\n- Content rentals are viewable on a single device at a time, and must be played within thirty (30) days, and completed within forty-eight (48) hours of the start of play (stopping, pausing or restarting does not extend this period).  \n\n- You may burn an audio playlist of purchased music to disc for listening purposes up to seven (7) times; this limitation does not apply to DRM-free Content. Other Content may not be burned to disc.  \n\n- Purchased Content will generally remain available for you to download, redownload, or otherwise access from Apple. Though it is unlikely, subsequent to your purchase, Content may be removed from the Services (for instance, because the provider removed it) and become unavailable for further download or access from Apple. To ensure your ability to continue enjoying Content, we encourage you to download all purchased Content to a device in your possession and to back it up.  \n\nApp Store Content:  \n\n- The term “Apps” includes apps and App Clips for any Apple platform and\/or operating system, including any in-app purchases, extensions (such as keyboards), stickers, and subscriptions made available in such apps or App Clips.  \n\n- Individuals acting on behalf of a commercial enterprise, governmental organization or educational institution (an “Enterprise”) may download and sync non-Arcade Apps for use by either (i) a single individual on one (1) or more devices owned or controlled by an Enterprise; or (ii) multiple individuals on a single shared device owned or controlled by an Enterprise. For the sake of clarity, each device used serially or collectively by multiple users requires a separate license.  \n\nApple Music:  \n\n- An Individual Apple Music membership allows you to stream on a single device at a time; a Family membership allows you or your Family members to stream on up to six (6) devices at a time.  \n\nApple Arcade:  \n\n- Apple Arcade Apps may only be downloaded, or redownloaded, with a valid Apple Arcade trial or subscription.  \n\n- If your subscription ends, Apps downloaded via Apple Arcade will no longer be accessible to you.  \n\nApple TV Content:  \n\n- For most channels, you can stream video Content on up to three (3) devices simultaneously.   \n\n- Learn more about Apple TV Content Usage Rules at https:\/\/support.apple.com\/HT210074.   \n\nF. TERMINATION AND SUSPENSION OF SERVICES  \n\nIf you fail, or Apple suspects that you have failed, to comply with any of the provisions of this Agreement, Apple may, without notice to you: (i) terminate this Agreement and\/or your Apple ID, and you will remain liable for all amounts due under your Apple ID up to and including the date of termination; and\/or (ii) terminate your license to the software; and\/or (iii) preclude your access to the Services.  \n\nApple further reserves the right to modify, suspend, or discontinue the Services (or any part or Content thereof) at any time with or without notice to you, and Apple will not be liable to you or to any third party should it exercise such rights.  \n\nG. DOWNLOADS   \n\nYou may be limited in the amount of Content you may download, and some downloaded Content may expire after a given amount of time after downloaded or first played. Certain Content may not be available for download at all.  \n\nYou may be able to redownload previously acquired Content (“Redownload”) to your devices that are signed in with the same Apple ID (“Associated Devices”). You can see Content types available for Redownload in your Home Country at https:\/\/support.apple.com\/HT204632. Content may not be available for Redownload if that Content is no longer offered on our Services.  \n\nContent also may be removed from our Services at any time (for instance, because the provider removed it), after which it cannot be downloaded, redownloaded, or otherwise accessed from Apple.  \n\nH. SUBSCRIPTIONS  \n\nThe Services and certain Apps may allow you to purchase access to Content or Services on a subscription basis (“Paid Subscriptions”). Paid Subscriptions automatically renew until cancelled in the Manage Subscriptions section of your account settings. To learn more about cancelling your subscriptions, visit https:\/\/support.apple.com\/HT202039. You will be notified if the price of a Paid Subscription increases and, if required, your consent will be required to continue. You will be charged no more than twenty-four (24) hours prior to the start of the latest Paid Subscription period. If we cannot charge your payment method for any reason (such as expiration or insufficient funds), and you have not cancelled the Paid Subscription, you remain responsible for any uncollected amounts, and we will attempt to charge the payment method as you may update your payment method information. This may result in a change to the start of your next Paid Subscription period and may change the date on which you are billed for each period, as displayed on your receipt. We reserve the right to cancel your Paid Subscription if we are unable to successfully charge your payment method to renew your subscription. Certain Paid Subscriptions may offer a free trial prior to charging your payment method. If you decide to unsubscribe from a Paid Subscription before we start charging your payment method, cancel the subscription at least twenty-four (24) hours before the free trial ends.   \n\nIf you start a free trial to a Paid Subscription offered by Apple as Content provider (an “Apple Paid Subscription”) and cancel before it ends, you cannot reactivate the free trial.  \n\nFree trials or free offers to Apple Paid Subscriptions, excluding iCloud, cannot be combined with any free trials or offers of Apple One. If you are in a free trial or free offer for any Apple Paid Subscriptions, and you subscribe to Apple One, your free trial(s) or offer(s) will not be paused even if you have access to such Apple Paid Subscription(s) through your Apple One subscription. You acknowledge that your free trial or free offer may expire while you are a Paid Subscriber to Apple One, and Apple shall have no obligation to reinstate, reimburse, or otherwise compensate you for any part of such expired free trial or free offer.  \n\nWhen your Paid Subscription to any Service or Content ends, you will lose access to any functionality or Content of that Service that requires a Paid Subscription.  \n\nI. CONTENT AND SERVICE AVAILABILITY  \n\nTerms found in this Agreement that relate to Services, Content types, features or functionality not available in your Home Country are not applicable to you unless and until they become available to you. To see the Content types available to you in your Home Country, go to the Services or visit https:\/\/support.apple.com\/HT204411. Certain Services and Content available to you in your Home Country may not be available to you when traveling outside of your Home Country.  \n\nJ. THIRD-PARTY DEVICES AND EQUIPMENT  \n\nYou may not be able to use all features of the Services when accessing them on a non-Apple-branded device. Additionally, certain Services may require, direct, or suggest you use third-party equipment in some circumstances and\/or for certain activities; such use is subject to the terms and conditions of such equipment and should be made in accordance with the applicable manufacturer’s instructions. By using the Services, you agree that Apple may automatically download and install minor updates to its software on third-party equipment from time to time.  \n\nK. YOUR SUBMISSIONS TO OUR SERVICES  \n\nOur Services may allow you to submit or post materials such as comments, ratings and reviews, pictures, videos, and podcasts (including associated metadata and artwork). Your use of such features must comply with the Submissions Guidelines below, which may be updated from time to time, and if we become aware of materials that violate our Submission Guidelines we will remove them. If you see materials that do not comply with the Submissions Guidelines, including any offensive, abusive, or illegal content, please let us know at reportaproblem.apple.com or by contacting Apple Support. Except to the extent prohibited by law, you hereby grant Apple a worldwide, royalty-free, perpetual, nonexclusive license to use the materials you submit within the Services and related marketing as well as to use the materials you submit for Apple internal purposes. Apple may monitor and decide to remove or edit any submitted material, including via automated content filters and\/or human review.   \n\nSubmissions Guidelines: You may not use the Services to:  \n\n- post any materials that (i) you do not have permission, right or license to use, or (ii) infringe on the rights of any third party;  \n\n- post objectionable, offensive, unlawful, deceptive, inaccurate, or harmful content;  \n\n- post personal, private or confidential information belonging to others;  \n\n- request personal information from a minor;  \n\n- impersonate or misrepresent your affiliation with another person, or entity;  \n\n- post or transmit spam, including but not limited to unsolicited or unauthorized advertising, promotional materials, or informational announcements;  \n\n- post, modify, or remove a rating or review in exchange for any kind of compensation or incentive;   \n\n- post a dishonest, abusive, harmful, misleading, or bad-faith rating or review, or a rating or review that is irrelevant to the Content being reviewed;  \n\n- plan or engage in any illegal, fraudulent, or manipulative activity.  \n\nL. FAMILY SHARING  \n\nThe organizer of a Family (“Organizer”) must be eighteen (18) years (or the equivalent age of majority in their Home Country) or older and the parent or legal guardian of any Family member under age thirteen (13) (or the equivalent minimum age in their Home Country as set forth in the registration process). Apple devices are required for access to all of the Family Sharing features. Family Sharing allows eligible subscriptions to be shared among up to six (6) members of a Family. To learn more about Family Sharing visit: https:\/\/support.apple.com\/en-us\/HT201060.  \n\nPurchase Sharing: Family Sharing’s Purchase Sharing feature allows eligible Content to be shared among up to six (6) members of a Family. The Organizer invites other members to participate, and agrees to pay for all Transactions initiated by Family members. The Organizer’s eligible payment methods are used to pay for any Transaction initiated by a Family member (except when the Family member’s account has store credit, which is always used first). Family members are acting as agents for the Organizer when the Organizer’s eligible payment methods are used. The Organizer hereby agrees: (1) to pay for such Transactions; (2) that Transactions initiated by Family members are authorized; and (3) Transactions will be charged to eligible payment methods in the manner indicated in Section B above. Organizers are responsible for complying with their payment method contracts, and assume all risk related to sharing access to their eligible payment methods with Family members. A receipt or invoice for any Family member Transaction is sent to the initiating Family member and, if billed to the Organizer’s payment method, also to the Organizer.   \n\nAsk to Buy: Ask to Buy is a feature that allows an Organizer to approve Transactions initiated by a Family member under age eighteen (18) (or the equivalent age of majority in their Home Country). Content shared by Family members or acquired via content codes generally is not subject to Ask to Buy; content codes facilitating access to subscriptions are subject to Ask to Buy. The Organizer must be the parent or legal guardian of any Family member for whom Ask to Buy is activated. Ask to Buy is enabled by default for any Family member under the age of thirteen (13) (or the equivalent minimum age in their Home Country) and stays on until deactivated by the parent or legal guardian. If Ask to Buy is turned off after the Family member turns eighteen (18) years old (or reaches the age of majority in their Home Country), it cannot be turned on anymore. Ask to Buy does not require Purchase Sharing to be enabled.  \n\nFamily Member changes: When a Family member leaves or is removed from the Family, the remaining Family members may no longer be able to access the former member’s Content, including Content acquired with the Organizer’s payment method.  \n\nFamily Sharing Rules: You can only belong to one (1) Family at a time, and may join any Family no more than twice per year. You can change the Apple ID you associate with a Family no more than once every ninety (90) days. All Family members must share the same Home Country. Not all Content, including In-App Purchases, subscriptions, and some previously acquired Apps, are eligible for Purchase Sharing. Apple TV+, Apple TV Channels, Apple One Family, Apple One Premier, Apple Music Family, Apple Arcade, Apple News+, and Apple Fitness+ subscriptions are automatically enabled for Family Sharing. Subscriptions shared by a Family may be subject to Content usage limitations on a per subscription basis.  \n\nM. SEASON PASS AND MULTI-PASS  \n\nA Pass allows you to purchase and receive television Content as it becomes available. A Season Pass applies to television Content that has a limited number of episodes per season; a Multi-Pass applies to television Content that is available on an ongoing basis. The full price of a Season Pass or Multi-Pass is charged at the time of the Transaction. Season Pass or Multi-Pass Content is available for download up to ninety (90) days after the last episode becomes available. If a Content provider delivers to Apple fewer TV episodes than planned when you purchased a Season Pass, we will credit to your Apple ID the retail value of the corresponding number of episodes that were not provided to Apple.  \n\nN. ADDITIONAL APP STORE TERMS (EXCLUDING APPLE ARCADE APPS)  \n\nLICENSE OF APP STORE CONTENT   \n\nApp licenses are provided to you by Apple or a third party developer (“App Provider”). Apple acts as an agent for App Providers in providing the App Store and is not a party to the sales contract or user agreement between you and the App Provider. However, if you are a customer of Apple Distribution International Ltd., then the merchant of record is Apple Distribution International Ltd., which means that you acquire the App license from Apple Distribution International Ltd., but the App is licensed by the App Provider. An App licensed by Apple is an “Apple App;” an App licensed by an App Provider is a “Third Party App.” Any App that you acquire is governed by the Licensed Application End User License Agreement (“Standard EULA”) set forth below, unless Apple or the App Provider provides an overriding custom license agreement (“Custom EULA”). Subject to local law, the App Provider of any Third Party App is solely responsible for its content and warranties, as well as any claims that you may have related to the Third Party App. You acknowledge and agree that Apple is a third-party beneficiary of the Standard EULA or Custom EULA applicable to each Third Party App and may therefore enforce such agreement. Certain Apps, such as stickers and iMessage apps, may not appear on the device springboard but can be accessed and used in the Messages app drawer.  \n\nIN-APP PURCHASES  \n\nApps may offer content, services or functionality for use within such Apps (“In-App Purchases”). In-App Purchases that are consumed during the use of the App (for example, virtual gems) cannot be transferred among devices and can be downloaded only once. You must authenticate your account before making In-App Purchases – separate from any authentication to obtain other Content – by entering your password or using Touch ID or Face ID. You will be able to make additional In-App Purchases for fifteen (15) minutes without re-authenticating unless you have asked us to require a password for every purchase or have enabled Touch ID or Face ID. You can turn off the ability to make In-App Purchases by following these instructions: https:\/\/support.apple.com\/HT201304.  \n\nAPP MAINTENANCE AND SUPPORT  \n\nApple is responsible for providing maintenance and support for Apple Apps only, or as required under applicable law. App Providers are responsible for providing maintenance and support for Third Party Apps.  \n\nAPP BUNDLES  \n\nSome Apps may be sold together as a bundle (“App Bundle”). The price displayed with an App Bundle is the price you will be charged upon purchasing the App Bundle. The App Bundle price may be reduced to account for Apps you have already purchased or acquired, but may include a minimum charge to complete the App Bundle.  \n\nSEARCH RESULTS AND RANKINGS  \n\nWhen determining how to order the Apps in search results, the main parameters considered are the metadata provided by App Providers, how customers have engaged with the Apps and the App Store, and the popularity of the Apps in the App Store. These main parameters deliver the most relevant results to customer search queries.  \n\nLICENSED APPLICATION END USER LICENSE AGREEMENT  \n\nApps made available through the App Store are licensed, not sold, to you. Your license to each App is subject to your prior acceptance of either this Licensed Application End User License Agreement (“Standard EULA”), or a custom end user license agreement between you and the App Provider (“Custom EULA”), if one is provided. Your license to any Apple App under this Standard EULA or Custom EULA is granted by Apple, and your license to any Third Party App under this Standard EULA or Custom EULA is granted by the App Provider of that Third Party App. Any App that is subject to this Standard EULA is referred to herein as the “Licensed Application.” The App Provider or Apple as applicable (“Licensor”) reserves all rights in and to the Licensed Application not expressly granted to you under this Standard EULA.  \n\na. Scope of License: Licensor grants to you a nontransferable license to use the Licensed Application on any Apple-branded products that you own or control and as permitted by the Usage Rules. The terms of this Standard EULA will govern any content, materials, or services accessible from or purchased within the Licensed Application as well as upgrades provided by Licensor that replace or supplement the original Licensed Application, unless such upgrade is accompanied by a Custom EULA. Except as provided in the Usage Rules, you may not distribute or make the Licensed Application available over a network where it could be used by multiple devices at the same time. You may not transfer, redistribute or sublicense the Licensed Application except as expressly permitted in this Agreement and, if you sell your Apple Device to a third party, you must remove the Licensed Application from the Apple Device before doing so. You may not copy (except as permitted by this license and the Usage Rules), reverse-engineer, disassemble, attempt to derive the source code of, modify, or create derivative works of the Licensed Application, any updates, or any part thereof (except as and only to the extent that any foregoing restriction is prohibited by applicable law or to the extent as may be permitted by the licensing terms governing use of any open-sourced components included with the Licensed Application).  \n\nb. Consent to Use of Data: You agree that Licensor may collect and use technical data and related information—including but not limited to technical information about your device, system and application software, and peripherals—that is gathered periodically to facilitate the provision of software updates, product support, and other services to you (if any) related to the Licensed Application. Licensor may use this information, as long as it is in a form that does not personally identify you, to improve its products or to provide services or technologies to you.  \n\nc. Termination. This Standard EULA is effective until terminated by you or Licensor. Your rights under this Standard EULA will terminate automatically if you fail to comply with any of its terms.  \n\nd. External Services. The Licensed Application may enable access to Licensor’s and\/or third-party services and websites (collectively and individually, \"External Services\"). You agree to use the External Services at your sole risk. Licensor is not responsible for examining or evaluating the content or accuracy of any third-party External Services, and shall not be liable for any such third-party External Services. Data displayed by any Licensed Application or External Service, including but not limited to financial, medical and location information, is for general informational purposes only and is not guaranteed by Licensor or its agents. You will not use the External Services in any manner that is inconsistent with the terms of this Standard EULA or that infringes the intellectual property rights of Licensor or any third party. You agree not to use the External Services to harass, abuse, stalk, threaten or defame any person or entity, and that Licensor is not responsible for any such use. External Services may not be available in all languages or in your Home Country, and may not be appropriate or available for use in any particular location. To the extent you choose to use such External Services, you are solely responsible for compliance with any applicable laws. Licensor reserves the right to change, suspend, remove, disable or impose access restrictions or limits on any External Services at any time without notice or liability to you.  \n\ne. NO WARRANTY: YOU EXPRESSLY ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT USE OF THE LICENSED APPLICATION IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE LICENSED APPLICATION AND ANY SERVICES PERFORMED OR PROVIDED BY THE LICENSED APPLICATION ARE PROVIDED \"AS IS\" AND “AS AVAILABLE,” WITH ALL FAULTS AND WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, AND LICENSOR HEREBY DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS WITH RESPECT TO THE LICENSED APPLICATION AND ANY SERVICES, EITHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, OR STATUTORY, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES AND\/OR CONDITIONS OF MERCHANTABILITY, OF SATISFACTORY QUALITY, OF FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OF ACCURACY, OF QUIET ENJOYMENT, AND OF NONINFRINGEMENT OF THIRD-PARTY RIGHTS. NO ORAL OR WRITTEN INFORMATION OR ADVICE GIVEN BY LICENSOR OR ITS AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE SHALL CREATE A WARRANTY. SHOULD THE LICENSED APPLICATION OR SERVICES PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE ENTIRE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR, OR CORRECTION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES OR LIMITATIONS ON APPLICABLE STATUTORY RIGHTS OF A CONSUMER, SO THE ABOVE EXCLUSION AND LIMITATIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.  \n\nf. Limitation of Liability. TO THE EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL LICENSOR BE LIABLE FOR PERSONAL INJURY OR ANY INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, INDIRECT, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES WHATSOEVER, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF PROFITS, CORRUPTION OR LOSS OF DATA, FAILURE TO TRANSMIT OR RECEIVE ANY DATA (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION COURSE INSTRUCTIONS, ASSIGNMENTS AND MATERIALS), BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, OR ANY OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO YOUR USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE LICENSED APPLICATION, HOWEVER CAUSED, REGARDLESS OF THE THEORY OF LIABILITY (CONTRACT, TORT, OR OTHERWISE) AND EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF LIABILITY FOR PERSONAL INJURY, OR OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. In no event shall Licensor’s total liability to you for all damages (other than as may be required by applicable law in cases involving personal injury) exceed the amount of two hundred and fifty dollars ($250.00). The foregoing limitations will apply even if the above stated remedy fails of its essential purpose.  \n\ng. You may not use or otherwise export or re-export the Licensed Application except as authorized by United States law and the laws of the jurisdiction in which the Licensed Application was obtained. In particular, but without limitation, the Licensed Application may not be exported or re-exported (a) into any U.S.-embargoed countries or (b) to anyone on the U.S. Treasury Department's Specially Designated Nationals List or the U.S. Department of Commerce Denied Persons List or Entity List. By using the Licensed Application, you represent and warrant that you are not located in any such country or on any such list. You also agree that you will not use these products for any purposes prohibited by United States law, including, without limitation, the development, design, manufacture, or production of nuclear, missile, or chemical or biological weapons.  \n\nh. U.S. Government End Users. The Licensed Application and related documentation are \"Commercial Items\", as that term is defined at 48 C.F.R. §2.101, consisting of \"Commercial Computer Software\" and \"Commercial Computer Software Documentation\", as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. §12.212 or 48 C.F.R. §227.7202, as applicable. Consistent with 48 C.F.R. §12.212 or 48 C.F.R. §227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4, as applicable, the Commercial Computer Software and Commercial Computer Software Documentation are being licensed to U.S. Government end users (a) only as Commercial Items and (b) with only those rights as are granted to all other end users pursuant to the terms and conditions herein. Unpublished-rights reserved under the copyright laws of the United States.  \n\ni. Except to the extent expressly provided in the following paragraph, this Agreement and the relationship between you and Apple shall be governed by the laws of the State of California, excluding its conflicts of law provisions. You and Apple agree to submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located within the county of Santa Clara, California, to resolve any dispute or claim arising from this Agreement. If (a) you are not a U.S. citizen; (b) you do not reside in the U.S.; (c) you are not accessing the Service from the U.S.; and (d) you are a citizen of one of the countries identified below, you hereby agree that any dispute or claim arising from this Agreement shall be governed by the applicable law set forth below, without regard to any conflict of law provisions, and you hereby irrevocably submit to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located in the state, province or country identified below whose law governs:  \n\nIf you are a citizen of any European Union country or the United Kingdom, Switzerland, Norway or Iceland, the governing law and forum shall be the laws and courts of your usual place of residence.  \n\nSpecifically excluded from application to this Agreement is that law known as the United Nations Convention on the International Sale of Goods.  \n\nO. ADDITIONAL TERMS FOR APP STORE, APPLE BOOKS, APPLE PODCASTS, AND SELECT CONTENT  \n\nSome Content available in App Store, Apple Books, and Apple Podcasts (including Apple Podcasts Subscriptions) are acquired by you from the third-party provider of such Content (as displayed on the product page and\/or during the acquisition process for the relevant Content), not Apple. In such case, Apple acts as an agent for the Content provider in providing the Content to you, and therefore Apple is not a party to the Transaction between you and the Content provider. However, if you are a customer of Apple Distribution International Ltd., then Apple Distribution International Ltd. is the merchant of record for the Content you acquire, but such Content is licensed by the Content provider. The Content provider reserves the right to enforce the terms of use relating to such Content. The Content provider is solely responsible for such Content, any warranties to the extent that such warranties have not been disclaimed, and any claims that you or any other party may have relating to such Content.  \n\nWhen determining how to order search results in App Store, Apple Books, and Apple Podcasts, the main parameters considered are the metadata given by Content providers and how customers have engaged with the Content.  \n\nP. ADDITIONAL APPLE MUSIC TERMS  \n\niCloud Music Library is an Apple Music feature that allows you to access your matched or uploaded songs, playlists and music videos acquired from Apple Music, the iTunes Store or another source (“iCloud Music Library Content”) on your Apple Music-enabled devices. iCloud Music Library is turned on automatically when you set up your Apple Music membership. iCloud Music Library collects information about your iCloud Music Library Content. This information is associated with your Apple ID, and compared to iCloud Music Library Content currently available on Apple Music. iCloud Music Library Content that is not matched is uploaded to Apple’s iCloud Music Library servers (in a format determined by Apple). You can upload up to one hundred thousand (100,000) songs. Songs acquired from the iTunes Store do not count against this limit. Songs that do not meet certain criteria (for example, excessively large files) or that are not authorized for your device are not eligible for iCloud Music Library. When you use iCloud Music Library, Apple logs information such as the tracks you play, stop or skip, the devices you use, and the time and duration of playback. You agree to use iCloud Music Library only for lawfully acquired content. iCloud Music Library is provided on an “AS IS” basis and could contain errors or inaccuracies. You should back up your data and information prior to using iCloud Music Library. If you are not an Apple Music member, you may purchase an iTunes Match subscription, which uses iCloud Music Library. When your Apple Music membership ends, you will lose access to your iCloud Music Library, including iCloud Music Library Content that is uploaded to iCloud Music Library servers.  \n\nQ. ADDITIONAL APPLE FITNESS+ TERMS  \n\nApple Fitness+ is for entertainment and\/or informational purposes only and is not intended to provide any medical advice.   \n\nR. CARRIER MEMBERSHIP  \n\nWhere available, you may be offered to purchase a Service membership from your wireless carrier (a “Carrier Membership”). If you purchase a Carrier Membership, your carrier is the merchant of record, which means that you acquire the Service license from your carrier, which will bill you for the cost of your Service membership, but the Service is licensed and provided by Apple. Your purchase relationship with the carrier is governed by the carrier’s terms and conditions, not this Agreement, and any billing disputes related to a Carrier Membership must be directed to your carrier, not Apple. By using a Service through a Carrier Membership, you agree that your carrier may exchange your carrier account information, telephone number and subscription information with Apple, and that Apple may use this information to determine the status of your Carrier Membership.  \n\nS. MISCELLANEOUS TERMS APPLICABLE TO ALL SERVICES  \n\nDEFINITION OF APPLE  \n\nDepending on your Home Country, “Apple” means:  \n\nApple Inc., located at One Apple Park Way, Cupertino, California, for users in the United States, including Puerto Rico;  \n\nApple Canada Inc., located at 120 Bremner Blvd., Suite 1600, Toronto ON M5J 0A8, Canada for users in Canada;  \n\nApple Services LATAM LLC, located at 1 Alhambra Plaza, Ste 700 Coral Gables, Florida, for users in Mexico, Central or South America, or any Caribbean country or territory (excluding Puerto Rico);  \n\niTunes K.K., located at Roppongi Hills, 6-10-1 Roppongi, Minato-ku, Tokyo 106-6140, Tokyo for users in Japan;  \n\nApple Pty Limited, located at Level 3, 20 Martin Place, Sydney NSW 2000, Australia, for users in Australia or New Zealand, including in any of their territories or affiliated jurisdictions; and  \n\nApple Distribution International Ltd., located at Hollyhill Industrial Estate, Hollyhill, Cork, Republic of Ireland, for all other users.  \n\nCONTRACT CHANGES  \n\nApple reserves the right at any time to modify this Agreement and to add new or additional terms or conditions on your use of the Services. Such modifications and additional terms and conditions will be effective immediately and incorporated into this Agreement.
