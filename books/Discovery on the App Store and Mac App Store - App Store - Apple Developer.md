The App Store and Mac App Store showcase your amazing apps and help customers find new favorites. They’re also where our editors share stories about inspiring developers and their incredible work. Find out how customers can discover your apps, and learn how our editors select apps and developers to feature.

## Search

Search on the App Store and Mac App Store allows customers to find apps, games, stories, categories, in-app purchases, and developers. Searches use app and in-app purchase metadata from your product page to deliver the most relevant results. We’re constantly evolving how search works to serve the best results to customers’ queries. When customers search for an app, the App Store returns a list of apps that are ranked based on a number of factors, including text relevance (matches for the app’s title, keywords, and primary category) and customer behavior (downloads and the number and quality of ratings and reviews). In addition to getting results for their specific search query, customers are shown suggested search terms to help them find what they’re looking for. They can also view Trending Searches to see what other customers in their region are interested in.

To learn more about crafting your product page metadata, see [Optimizing Your Product Page](https://developer.apple.com/app-store/product-page/).

## Categories

Categories on the App Store and Mac App Store sort apps based on their main function or subject matter. Customers can browse categories, such as Entertainment, Shopping, or Social Networking, to find related apps. You can assign a primary and a secondary category to your app. The primary category is particularly important for discoverability, as it helps users find your app when browsing or filtering search results, and it determines in which tab your app appears on the App Store.

To learn more, see [Choosing a Category](https://developer.apple.com/app-store/categories/).

## Today Tab

The Today tab on the App Store is a daily destination with original stories from our editors around the world, featuring exclusive premieres, new releases, a fresh look at our all-time favorites, an App of the Day, a Game of the Day, and more. It offers tips and how-to guides to help customers use apps in innovative ways, and showcases interviews with inspiring developers. Stories share Apple’s unique perspective on apps and games and how they impact our lives, using artwork, videos, and developer quotes to bring your apps to life.

## Games and Apps Tabs

The App Store is also the world’s best game store, with dedicated experiences for games and apps that inform and engage customers through recommendations on new releases and updates, videos, top charts, and handpicked collections and categories. Both tabs also feature app preview videos that autoplay with muted audio as customers scroll through the tabs, and selected in-app purchases — which customers can start buying directly on the App Store.

## Promoted In-App Purchases

Customers can browse in-app purchases directly on the App Store and start a purchase even before downloading your app, helping your app’s content gain exposure. You can promote up to 20 in-app purchases, including subscriptions, on your app’s product page. They can also appear in search results and may be featured by our editorial team.

## Getting Featured

App Store editors write stories that showcase apps in interesting and informative ways. Our editors base their decisions on a variety of factors, all of which amount to a great product that customers will love. There is no paid placement or checklist of requirements for apps we write about or feature.

**Stories.** App Store editors talk about apps that have a unique story — for example, a behind-the-scenes look at how a developer launched an app that disrupted an industry or how an app helped a customer solve a unique problem.

**Apps and Games.** When considering apps to feature, our editors look for high-quality apps across all categories, with a particular focus on new apps and apps with significant updates. Factors that our editors consider include:

-   UI design: the usability, appeal, and overall quality of the app
-   User experience: the efficiency and functionality of the app
-   Innovation: apps that solve a unique problem for customers
-   Localizations: high quality and relevant
-   Accessibility: well-integrated features
-   App Store product page: compelling screenshots, app previews, and descriptions
-   Uniqueness

For games, editors also consider:

-   Gameplay and level of engagement
-   Graphics and performance
-   Audio
-   Narrative and story depth
-   Ability to replay
-   Gameplay controls
