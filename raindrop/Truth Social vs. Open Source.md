## Metadata

"Truth Social is based on Mastodon, free and open-source software that is released under the AGPLv3 license. AGPLv3 requires any derivative source code to be publicly available. Because Truth Social's terms describe its software as proprietary, Mastodon founder and lead developer Eugen Rochko has said: "that would be a problem, as that would indicate a license violation".[9] On October 22, the Software Freedom Conservancy said that Truth Social was in violation of the terms of the license, and that TMTG had 30 days to comply." - (Excerpt from Truth Social's Wikipedia Page: https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Truth_Social)
