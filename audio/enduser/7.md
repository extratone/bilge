Better alternative title (unfornately not appropriate): ***Writing With Light in The Digital Garden***

Welcome to episode 7 of *End User*. I'm David Blue, and you last heard from me on the first of May, a little over 5 months ago. Since then, I've gone back to school - which has been more interesting, technologically, then I expected - bought a desktop PC, delved into *digital gardens*, read about the history of word processing, and done my best to assimilate into the cult of a new notetaking service, Notion. (Thanks to my new .edu email.) Also because of my school email, I now have a Creative Cloud subscription and have committed to learning InDesign somewhat expediently. 

- *End User* has made $1.58 so far. Incredible.

### Mom's File Management

- Mom's File Management Anecdote Transcript

    Who's 70 and a private practicing therapist? Ann is both not at all like someone you think. Who is 70 years old and is in some ways she came to me over the weekend and was like she hardly ever just explicitly like actually sincerely asked for help and was like I need help with my computer.

    I feel like I can't do anything and so I go and she she's running a pretty powerful Mac book pro. It's a an. She uses it all the time. 1 one thing. Thankfully, I didn't actually realize this, but while she takes notes all day long, none of those notes are stored.

    Um on on her machine, they're stored in the proprietary healthcare documentation software that she pays to handle everything like handle the billing and stuff, but anyway, so that's an important preface. It's not as severe as it sounds, so I actually go and I get on her MacBook.

    And I have to bring my own mouse because she's the only I swear she's the only OS 10 user wrote macros Caesar that actually uses this, like selects this one optional check mark in the trackpad options that involves using 3D touch to.

    It's it's literally the I can't figure it out anyway, so through my own mouse I see. Here's what I see I see, uh, a desktop that's just full of stuff, but it's not actually that many files is, you know, a lot of duplicates I see, Oh my God, I've actually like almost made me cry so.

    A lot of files, like just like half named like. I don't know what to do with this. I really hate that my mom's been struggling with this 'cause I it's the *****worst. It actually is the *****worst anyway. I could like and I I used to be really good at using Mac OS or Mac OS. Used to be better I don't know but what I saw were actually.

    Were hardly the total amount of files and folders on this computer was not that much at all, but what I had done before to help her out is an old habit that I had, which if a directory got too full, I would just make a make a new folder. I'm sure you've done this, call it.

    Uh, aggregation or dump, and, um, take everything else in that directory and put it in that folder and I see I had done that over layers of time with her computer again. Thank God she doesn't have to deal with it. I thought it was yourself, but I guess my point is I I basically ended up doing that.

    The solution is not the important thing, I guess, but thinking about it. The promise that's it's kept us going without with such poor file management. Basically like the file managers that we use, like they're like windows Explorer is not a very good File Manager, specially not in its default configuration I've been.

    Like working on optimizing things, like doing custom icons. Sounds like I'm not doing it 'cause it's pretty. I'm doing it 'cause like visuals we are not taking advantage of visuals like we could ramble. I'm sorry. I wonder how many tweets this is going to be, but anyway the promise was was search was that.

    Our organization was going to matter 'cause whatever we needed, we were going to pull up spotlight there, you know, and search for it and then boom, get it and I realized that for the most part I have been doing that. I mean, iOS is great with that right? I think the new app libraries are stupid because, well, actually, basically you don't need.

    In my opinion, any icons on home screen you can just drag down and search windows is still. I don't know if they're going to do it, but they're still doing a similar function, but there's some important addendums to that, because it's like our File Manager is cannot search this new computer that I have. Is it ridiculously powerful?

    CPU I can go to a directory and type most of the name of a file after after I've made sure to index everything right and it still won't find it with any speed or like it. It just slows down. Yeah so I I don't know search.

    I'm worn out with it. I think it's one of the reasons why I'm doing the not that I don't depend on it in notion too, but like working on trying to do a personal wiki. There maybe like a static HTML one eventually, like there is something to be said about organizing stuff yourself because it's important that you be able to see it.

    Yeah, it's not enough to just dump it in a pile, even if you're really, really good at calling a search from that file. 'cause you'll forget about it. Has this been useful? I don't know. I don't really care. Actually I do. I hope it's been useful. I hope it doesn't just immediately delete, but yeah, we did. We need to figure this out. We stopped searching for.

    For a second and look through your file directories and see if you discover anything. 'cause I have. I've been doing that.

- I could swear MacOS has gotten worse with file management, but it's very possible that *I* have just gotten much better at my personal file management in Windows.
