# The Radical Minutia Meta

On Saturday, September 4th, I [scheduled](https://twitter.com/i/spaces/1dRKZNYXoqaKB) a Twitter Space entitled "[How to Explain iOS 15 to Your Mom](https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/1434240004079947776)" a few hours in advance, not necessarily expecting any speakers *or* guests to show up, but an old friend and two new ones did! They indulged me for a near-2 hour conversation about a whole lot and I really appreciate it.
