> If you follow more people than follow you, what you are in essence saying to that person is "I followed all these people, but only some of them found me interesting enough to follow me back."
>
> ##### Not only that, but you are also saying "Yes, I may have recently followed you, but don't take it too personally, I like to follow a lot of people, so really, the fact that I cared enough to follow you doesn't mean I am genuinely interested in what you have to say."
