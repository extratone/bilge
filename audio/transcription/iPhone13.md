Hello I'm a real human being and I will soften my pocket with 1 TB storage with a six core CPU with the ability well that that was designed to do it best to emulate photography equipment that numbers in the six figures my cellular phone which I use mostly for texting calling my mom and getting directions but I don't travel all that much because I'm working person and actually notably the thing I do is I'm not supposed to at work I browse the web in in Safari and this device in my pocket the iPhone 13 pro is the most professional phone ever bought it certainly Apple's most professional cellular phone ever this is a feel like it's an old record now because I was going to write a review of my iPhone 12 pro max and that review was gonna was is entitled will be entitled the access in the exosphere wait something like that of the iPhone 12 pro max I guess I said it over and over again and I thought it might I might be getting better at it but box I know that the pro is distinctly four power users yes but even the iPhone 13 we're just going in ridiculous directions folks OK here's a fact this 12 promax is distinctly a poorer image capturing device in the way that I need a phone to be done my iPhone 8 Plus is in the ability to fairly quickly and not ideal conditions capture the best possible image that I want If it's a little bit I cannot get it to her to come even close I literally like my iPhone 8 plus I remember being really fun of some of my foot like my favorite photograph that I took with my boss I literally took out of the sunroof while driving at the sunroof on interstate going 80 miles an hour diagonally with one hand and yeah but like books I guess I just OK I will say it even though I've said it before another voice notes I just make a video but this is the only thing that I can automatically truncates I was away from Imagine if we start of it at the 8+ he has a 12 megapixel camera there's no optical zoom or maybe I think that was the first one without them but it's not really and there's actually a mystery civilization on the video anyway you look at the specs but like if Kim is Blake or expectations of phone camera stopped there in terms of sheer size because folks Apple is not and well smart phone companies like these are not the first cameras in the world in fact they're just incredibly compromised designs billions and billions of dollars going to researching how to make this configuration like how to make the best possible image come out of the worst possible constraints for a image capture device small Has been durable etc. etc. and you know what the truth is the way to do it is that it is heavy heavy automated manipulation of the images you notice but what if we stopped at the 88+ or even you know what my iPhone 4 would stop there and turned all the money that's been spent on making the cameras in his phones you know reach for these ridiculous and fundamentally unreachable like standards what if we just invested all that money in I don't know I think I'm's mind is even more invested in battery do I keep them though you know Imagine if what I was gonna say I said this some voice up before I would trade the hole that especially the rear Karen Mrs. camera system entirely on my 12 promax for the battery life that you could fit in the phone and I'm sure it like you know I don't know I know that the the numbers it's hard to Twitter likes figure out the equivalent what is my what is the iPhone 12 Pro Max is rear camera equivalent of more battery life especially now that does that mean Miniaturize fine or be on our comprehension oh yeah I don't add the check I don't think they may the iPhone 13 anything or of them is not thank God oh my God accelerate that box I have some insight for you if you wanna come after cinematic video go get a camera cameras good There's so many different kinds of camera security so are you feel like what are you say of which is like a DSLR sensor in a year and a hard shell body the sign for like it's Larry waterproof it's what I thought Hong Kong oh my God like if you really wanna cash that you know what like you're gonna have to have specific priorities puppy I really do I have to everything that is because the lady and I just don't OK one more thing will the iPhone 13 bad or any details but existed for Read the iPhone 13 and I O go look at the iPhone photography words you don't have to explore the details it's literally on the main page note which specific models of iPhones are represented and how how often Arizona I think I can if there are two what was then the top my phone me the 12 hour max there's a fine see you on there but I know that's probably stuck iPad definitely was a sex yeah I don't know I just literally a solution for me and I know I'm I'm griping because it doesn't make any sense and because well I now have a pretty much set an appointment explain the new phones to my siblings How do I explain to my sister whether not she should buy an iPhone 13 like this thing is that Absecon sure the other you'll never will never make sense in your video counseling life when you just wanna catch you know quickly snap video of dogs or whatever is more course than the sum of all of your computers and 15 billion transistors but the speed limit is on display in Apple Maps without being on a specific route
