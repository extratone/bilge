I thought on my record to spoken thoughts about the scored well it is someone who I got a tire and service so today I went in and I push the question and I and some iOS discord and nobody answer my question but I got to run a bot on my profile oh my account and it came up with the statistics on my discord account was like Cesar is six years old and I was like damn this old account course they didn't answer the question but yeah I am I will remember discord better yet a life without us using whatever discord is doing right now and I want to get to that but at the time that this word came out it was just it was a miracle compared to all the other ways there were to chat or to record a podcast with people who are in remote location originally discord was actually optimized for in the browser and you could set it up so that I can have somebody click one link come in to my discord room without creating creating an account approve mic and speaker permissions and then just go and I can enter them right there in the initially it started off as was 128 nothing for free was even remotely like just nothing approach that in terms of a recording for a podcast so I guess I'll decide it very early on I don't know it's like was that I was going to when I started my online magazine in in 2016 that the central hub is gonna be the discourse basically I was like I launched an independent media company_ And then I wrote a thing of yours the other is called discord is better than slack but here's the issue that I say nothing fucking changed I mean like visually that's my big thing which funny out like anyone with any sort of visual accessibility instructions any sort of low vision users immediately have to or base with her they are not accommodate for NFA sick out the third-party accommodations of course are there now plentiful and by that I mean third-party that were themes apps whatever that's against fear are terms of service self what's so weird to me and now of course everyone else with the skirt is and like I basically my thing with this one is better than slack as I was complaining because the only reason people didn't they were feature parallel and discord was even better in terms of Is a free service I was frustrated because literally the only reason building is the score of this because they called them selves a thing for gamers Jeffrey Amherst and everybody thought it was a gamer thing that was the only reason I'm glad we got past that I guess but frankly I am I don't know what the fuck discord like in tends to happen because from my perspective literally all of the feature additions I have come from third parties I am responding to go to the panic of the API changes and like I said is there a single feature edition others commands now we're out of the native command/Windsor are you useful really anyway like it's all third parties And I said I don't I just you know you're in a situation like the score it's like you either have to do it Twitter did when they shut down there if I was just say we are going to just build all the features that that these third-party apps might have course they fail but like and we're gonna you know we are taking the whole responsibility and we're going all full proprietary full native will do everything that your third-party services APS services can answer Are available for discord like from what I see it would feel even worse and honestly like I guess that I'm in the decisions kind of just stopped making sense as soon as they can like as soon as the score became escaped that gamer thing like stages even some of the thread like do you know it's just now all of a sudden it is that thing it like reminds me a lot of how I felt about ventrilo and and forgive me open open community people open stores gonna be open but I don't see in 2015 when does "came along And like the thing about they just kept doing things that made sense right like and I kind of just I guess that says long time ago and now I mean I'm glad that I don't run extra Tavern on the Square anymore um it's so exists and you can come out if you want but like I don't know it's just a slower I mean the I was ours is clunky and broken it's just like and again without without allowing third-party services to do the work for them or not but I honestly I've I have tried as a mission Bami this word sure I have tried third-party this word clients and they did not find a configuration that I felt was was better anyway the native app which is sad God it's just I mean it is it something I should've predicted I guess but really what I'm wondering is like nothing I've done that much in the interim but honestly as someone who is using discord six years ago other than 1/3 party developers largely open sort largely obvious developers oh I've done have Addit discord what does I mean not that much is changed which basic question like a Sim picture of the discord officer that somehow I download the Preskett and they have like stock photos of this where I was and I was once people laughing and I'm like what what what have you been doing well I guess like it like serious and I guess a lot of that maybe you want to moderation but like OK yes one more time the color theme thing I am very tired of looking at that fucking great OK but more importantly than that like in Nutley just any sort of visual accessibility please I don't what I really don't I didn't want to find myself in this bitch let the score it was one of those orders that I really felt so good about it I felt it was such a smart and add this doesn't have to happen like they're already past the point where they are enrolled with over the wrestler was like OK well I think money now that's ridiculous Brinkley obviously I don't know about business but like if she years and years that system does not seem to be to lead to our a icons from my perspective the venture capital system anyway but yeah I guess I'll also include by saying honestly telegram I just wish everyone that I wish that I knew anyone honestly that would that would touch and telegram I wish that I could've gone back and just I don't understand why he wouldn't use telegram other than I guess there's some shady concert on there but like if I can't find like any other groups to join for like I don't know I was development like intentionally I feel like you're not accidentally stumbled upon bad shit anyway wow discord I'm gonna I'm gonna disrupt them with my new messaging service hold the telephone
