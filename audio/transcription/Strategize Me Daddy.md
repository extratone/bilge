Photo chip keep the kids out of the frame just happen to see that little tip on tinder when I actually took one of the six photos down I have and the grid just because I forgot a forgotten of until today to get around to putting a video on my profile I guess I can play the audio for you right now I don't know if it's not worth it 15 seconds as we saying you can't see my face I have a cold sore but please sincerely don't strategize if you see me strategizing say something really done with this strategic forget certain strap stratification certification of social media and I know it's frankly it's clubhouse going on clubhouse at all has been with me this seem like such a rapid onset infection of strategy and social but actually it just occurred to me oh yeah I was gonna say the fact that when I get an idea for you to make that I like do this first probably indicates almost certainly indicates a real breakdown in the way that I take notes tell me when my very first tweet was over strategize because I lied watching Jimmy is 2008 I didn't have any friends in town and grab on the finals and found myself a suburban College town public school eighth grade and I know it was a lie because which chili a witness is important as it is strategizing so I literally would watch like I wouldn't set aside time to sit and watch Saturday night live every Saturday night on laughing and not knowing any of the people involved because I thought that's probably what my classmates did if you receive the office so I have I can only assume that tweets but I just think about that the 2008 I guess I must've must've been dead software I can't even I can't even fathom the scene oh yeah I know the time is now but I just don't remember it right now it's like 9 PM there's a like it was a blatant lie made in order to you because I thought that that would bring people to me that is strata strategizing social media one oh one right there when I get back to you the tent thing how can I save it for those of you though it in 2000 years listening of for those of you thinking oh yeah that's a reasonable tip tenders in Santa is to get as many people swiping right or whatever the fuck which are the way it is where you say yes as possible and yeah I mean I've got there's something fundamentally it's not offering what it is when you see children the frame is oh you're probably busy huh I just like it's not necessarily that it makes them immediately did are interesting romantically although that would be the most primal shit here so I don't know maybe that but what I'm saying is of course if that chip is the end goal for a book for all parties involved is to just get right swipes is to just get connections at the expense of transparency and truth but they're going to find out they have kids eventually OK and I'm sorry the vast majority of people don't want hook ups the vast vast majority of people especially in my area or on tinder because they want to go on a date and they probably want to get married is the rest isn't another time for us anyway so the end result though for everybody but tinder perhaps is negative then that result in theory it is a intenders best interest of course to minimize many long-term committed relationships that happened as a result of tinder as possible but seeing that element yes I know that's OK it's still icky as fuck stop justifying things because it makes for higher numbers justify please stop explaining to me the reason why Apple is doesn't do documentation 100% well that's that's how they've gotten so successful yes exactly for one end to our end what are you trying to do here I'm not talking I have said this billion times when I say I talk about strategy and social media I'm not saying that the whole profession of running the outside with the appraiser shouldn't work the whole profession of a running of the Ford Motor Company's social media accounts in a way which maintains a very specific image about them and yet still does engage with people often sincerely that's a legitimate profession and always has been assigned them talking about I wanna say legitimate fashion still not what I'm talking about I'm talking to the people who didn't get market injuries are not actively employed as a marketer or even doing a freelance work in the industry of public relations or marketing and yet still use the same terminology and their day-to-day get together is on clubhouse what are the things as leverage OK now I am gonna say it every time someone said that I think I legitimately first wanna ask them what kind of lover using and it really is because when I think of leverage I think of the aspect of physics where in order to get the Lugnuts off the combine it was huge fucking Lugnuts impact wrenches don't even work he literally my dad there's specific wrenches for that like fucking 5 feet long to get leverage and then of course you actually end up having to attach like another 5 foot pipe and then you stand on one end it's actually not supposed to be that tight anyway he's working but I do remember specifically when my dad I got a new combine oh God he was pissed that they got the Titans light on so much is so dangerous but that's what leverages what are you doing I'm just taking my fucking father at the end of the Stanford Rich screaming and cussing her to get this fucking lug nut off I know that of course but it really is what you're doing you're you're taking your acting in the manner of someone who is on social media media in an explicitly detached professional sense and but you don't do that you don't work for anybody you're just it's fucking arm 1:15 in the afternoon on a Tuesday and you're a room was like fuck in the 70 people on clubhouse nobody nobody has a specific company that I work for a while and you talking about how innovative Casas strategy there is the average social media use are the only reasonable strategy is which everyone gets you engaged with as many people as many different kinds we will in a sincere manner that adds value to both your lies as possible the only time that you should stop before you say something on social media is not right omission violence or something is wrong with something else you can say that strategy right there but you're strategizing to be a better person I wanna see better person I guess you could say I'm more effective person because the end result is not philanthropy it is that self benefit it is that optimization if you want to optimize the interested and empathetic and curious and kind that's your social media strategy
