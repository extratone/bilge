I just had a realization that should probably be alarming but it it might actually explain something that has really has been unexplained before and that is why I get so dramatic and animated about like one piece of software functioning in a different way than another one that's just right I mean that's like Ultimately special Perspectives that I I think I try to come from for instance writing the is the user experience aesthetic argument in the form of an academic paper attacking Facebook from that direction just being like I'll be on the day that here's what you can actually go see right now and that is a piece of software that is designed unlike software has been designed for ever basically and that is it is not designed to be as easy as not designed to help you accomplish the task that you came to accomplish I think me I've been a little of me 10 years throughout the state is out like why Facebook felt so different than else because I know I'm gonna kill aware of one of what I'm supposed to be doing on software anyway anyway destinations People is it like it's been a pattern and I guess I've been self deprecating self-awareness they just be on it furthers it but like oh yeah who is my astrology I'm stressed out it's like one of my three negative traits the week anyway but whenever I bring you things up like now getting on the elevator on Spotify or whatever this is really a pause and then I just like and then some conversation comes along that's like you need to find your community man I mean I agree sort of but that's the thing man you're saying that you're trying to see what I'm doing by suggesting that I do exactly what I'm doing which is I think that it's it is an identity forming process being probably upset right about the future of one of our most precious like one of our species debatably our species most precious form of expression music artist It's not it's not it's not that it's all of my friends who should now be who would now be comfortably living as professional musicians Anyway OK that's too far off task here's the gist when I just have to except it the shit that I use at least in this point in time that's my darling I guess the choices that I considered arguments that I make and the jokes and all of it that must be my running it's not a It's not product month does this fit that should make sense that's not what I'm talking about all I think of you like better off if I just if I could just like a walk-through frame by frame apps and talk about them that way I would say that maybe I don't know yeah now I feel like I actually lost the inside maybe I just I'm just insane Publicly by the way sad even though I think it's sad I guess like yeah when I when I jump into a conversation and I'm like hey dude I've before you go off and convert back to wordplay press again in your life look at what I found I found the host of my blog who is it they built the software they Jose it's Matt Baer and some others who aren't faceless and not the sense that like they're obviously that they're just yeah I get the sense that they're they've been height they've been working on something for a long time it's gonna be big and I kind of know the shirt anyway And like if you if you really were seeking a simple means of publishing in markdown of proposing from Mark down to the ends of being a static HD also basically that's affordable fast and simple in a way that makes it a bus if you really wanted that then you would've clung to or you would cling to write as rightfully for your life as I have because everything else I promise you it's not I'm not saying that everything else that ever will be it's just it's even going into that conversation means that you failed right if if our goal is to not have to think about the platform Anyway I say this all because the interest that those are mistakes that I waste a lot of my lifetime yeah I think this is it this one of my life my list of recommended Martyn texted us only has one on it it's Typora doesn't that's fine darling yeah
