# A Symbol of Excess
Well I have now lived with the flag ship phone the iPhone 12 pro max for seven whole days and it's it's been insane which is ridiculous thing to say about having a new phone but it's what I mean makes clear Wow what should I get should be obvious I guess I am in the in the literature in a litter litter history of the iPhone him This promax It's just access it's over it's him gluttony Yeah I've been without jailbreaking keep in mind I am which is something I have to investigate again can you please jailbreaking still think but I am I have set up like a clone get repositories in my fucking phone I am I've downloaded Torrance arm I have played far too much of what's basically a full consul game I've seen myself playing that game in HD Arm And I've set up a bunch of automated stuff Yeah I've taken some ridiculous photos This thing is just No it's it's I guess compared to the 8+ I have before I am Through this feeling of limitless power I am And I also to second revelation I want to discuss in his voice now is that I don't well Apple is not the wall garden That it that people still seem to think it is I am I thought about that when Siri shortcuts came out and they've been neutered in a big way I am at seems like all the shortcut library's have been going to There's still people messing around that There's really not that much she can do that with Shortcuts there isn't more elegantly automated another way but that's another subject I guess I am I really can't imagine what the regular iPhone user I think some shortcuts I am there just a toy they've been made a toy another official Shortcuts a really useful I don't think I'd like to now on Yeah this is this devices So much more Then I guess even my original like my Like grandest vision for the iPhone as someone is using iPhones those with my whole adult life more arm I feel like this is has exceeded it And I don't know what that means other than I think it means that it's a very wasteful thing I am and it's very tempting distracting for family distracting thing I am I don't I don't know at least for my own life if we define a useful device as one That rolls of who's fault it is as a net positive affect on my productivity Well so far It's not it but that's my fault I guess I just can't imagine What is four Who is for This professional who Just want to carry around in the SLR Because you can't you can't replace a DSLR with one of these phones he just can't is good like I don't understand much about the tire for you but like I am The addition in this one the super white angle there are useless for that sure but like If you actually take those photographs No it's too much is too wide and I mean I think it's certainly smart of them to do that and to invest a lot and making and they did make mechanical engineers I wish I haven't seen if I can hear it moving yet I need to do that a Yeah cause I don't think it's reasonable to try to make a highly telescopic lens either what exactly are we trying to do here you know I think you if you been observing my past few days well with my past my life I think you are always saying that over and over again but especially my use of this phone
