# Recommendations

![Compaq Portable 386](https://i.snap.as/niq0aqH.png)

After writing "[Dirty Dave's Poweruser Tips](https://bilge.world/poweruser-tips-software-shortcuts)," I thought it'd be appropriate to have a dedicated, ongoing recommendations page for my favorite/most recommended software. (I also really just wanted to use that incredible featured image.)

## Writing

### [Bear](https://bear.app/)

Bear is the most beautiful piece of software I've ever seen, both functionally and stylistically.

### [Typora](https://typora.io/)

As an alternative to Bear, Typora is technically much more powerful. Customizable themes and folder selection allow the user to do virtually anything, which may be a downside for some.

## Social

### [Mastodon](https://joinmastodon.org/)

Mastodon may be dominated by the tech-oriented right now, but *you* have the power to change that. Back in 2017, I [interviewed its creator, Eugen Rochko for *Extratone*](https://write.as/extratone/mastodon-eugen-rochko-federated-social-network).

### [Periscope](https://www.pscp.tv/)

Periscope is one of the best places on the internet, ever. It's generally positive, fascinating, and entirely unique.

### [Discord](https://discord.com/)

Discord is advertised as "chat for gamers," but frankly, I think it's the best way to host an active social community. I built *Extratone* using [our Discord server](https://discord.gg/0b9KQUKP858b0iZF).

## Email

### [Spark](https://sparkmailapp.com/)

"Love your email again" is Spark's logline, and it's a fairly accurate one. The ability to mark three emails as read at a time is absolutely invaluable for a smartphone-based mail application.
