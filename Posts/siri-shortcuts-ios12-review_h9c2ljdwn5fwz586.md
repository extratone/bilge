# Profound Revelations in iOS 12

![Siri Shortcuts](https://i.snap.as/ShVoCP3.png)

## Apple's latest mobile OS update might've seemed mundane, but Siri Shortcuts gives users vastly more power than Apple customers have ever before experienced.

Back in 2016, *Pokémon Go*, overclocked Apple Watches, pissing wearables, and What You See is What You Get blogging services all claimed unprecedented casualties among consumers according to *Futureland*'s iOS 10 episode, which we did our absolute best to dramatize in order to survive what was expected to be the dullest event on record. We'd only that day been first made aware of Boomerang photos and the mysterious nature of "Live Blogging" as an occupation. [AirPods were introduced](https://www.theverge.com/2016/12/20/14016568/apple-airpods-wireless-earpods-earbuds-review) and subsequently shit on, and the [comparatively archaic](https://bilge.world/mono-audio-playback) 3.5mm analog audio jack was confidently parted with, finally. At least I got over "forgetting" about Live Photos because it's rapidly becoming difficult to keep stuff *on* the phone now. *I* am coming sincerely close to believing none of this is real, anyway. Today, though, it’s a damned straight ballgame, isn’t it? Months have passed since Apple pushed out its major mobile OS release of the year to [more little rectangular computers](https://www.theverge.com/2016/1/26/10835748/apple-devices-active-1-billion-iphone-ipad-ios) than any one person could speedcount in a lifetime and YouTube is already recommending me dozens of [videos about the next one](https://youtu.be/CXKqCWWjxSM). At this point, you and I are already aware of the iOS development community, who has already been using Internet Operating System 12 on their personal devices for more than half a year by the time your irises are landing here. Hopefully, all but two or three stranded, dying explorers in the arctic have updated their iPhones and iPads by now, and why wouldn’t they?

Our expectations from this ritual are completely alien compared to those we’d need to anticipate from the event 5 or 6 releases ago, when one’s phone had to be sent away (in a sense) to latch itself tight to the stability of a desktop-class product in order to undergo a lengthy, destined metamorphosis. Sometimes, backups via 30-pin to USB-2.0 cables took hours, after which the custodian may or may not find their companion’s replication had completed successfully. If it had, one had to be sure to close any applications apart from iTunes to provide a working environment of utter silence – restarting after finishing the download was my own preferred method – before entrusting the despicably unreliable software to whittle away in a sometimes frantically rebooting, feverish procedure with near life-threatening stigma: it wasn’t uncommon for an update to inexplicably fail, “bricking” the subject iPhone and requiring that one take two whole steps in the wrong direction and restore it from the entire backup they’d just created (hopefully) in order to… make another, precisely-identical attempt, for lack of variables or alternatives to the process. However, if the user planned sufficiently and made a point to begin the whole charade immediately upon arriving home for the evening, these potential frustrations could be compensated for, and odds would favor counting on their smartphone to emerge safe and sound from the procedure just before bed, when even those holding the second-newest product in the lineage would have just enough screen time to notice that text entry, web page loading, and window management had noticeably slowed before sighing and tossing their device toward the darkness.

These days, one would need to try very hard to be inconvenienced by iOS updates. My iPhone 8 Plus is two or three times more powerful than my laptop at the moment, and my new friends’ WiFi connection is better than what the State government uses internally, back home. I haven’t needed to physically back it up more than once or twice since I bought it — iCloud stores the lot for $4.99­ a month anyway. I blinked once watching *Riki-Oh* with high school friends some time ago and all of the sudden, a 1.6GB download isn’t really a big deal. Siddown and watch your Instagram stories for twenty minutes, and *hey*! You’re ready to update! Somehow, I have abruptly found myself in a reality in which **I am the obvious bottleneck** and my 100 words per minute on a smartphone keyboard, even, is no longer fast enough: my fucking phone is now **waiting on me** when it updates. The keyholder is the whole goddamned holdup.

So, what possible purpose could there be in pounding out this “Review” of a free software update that’s in no way optional (waiting a month is no longer a rational minimization of risk — it’s just dumb,) not any more difficult to attain than the bills currently waiting in your mailbox, nor allowed by the nature of mobile operating systems to compete with any cross-platform alternatives? For myself, it’s proved [a gratifying tradition of sorts](http://bilge.world/ios-10-review-speed/) and a good use of my apparently-abundant time if only for the record's sake (hello, future web archivists, neohuman and otherwise!,) but this release – assuming I haven’t overlooked something – is the most globe-shucking of all because of one single featureset: **Siri Shortcuts**. However, the v	ast majority of the intra-Apple press' coverage of this release has come across nearly as unconcerned with them as I was originally. Take [*Macworld*'s iOS 12 Review](https://www.macworld.co.uk/review/ios-apps/ios-12-3683670/), for instance: it was the first result in my Google search for "iOS 12 review," yet Siri Shortcuts are only mentioned in the bottom quarter of its first page. When I recorded the "[iOS 12 Review](https://radiopublic.com/end-user-WdbezM/ep/s1!ba096)" episode of my "[podcast](https://anchor.fm/davidblue)," I spoke as if I was somehow the only person on the planet who comprehends the profound implications of this software addition - which was, of course, more of [an absorbent acquisition](https://techcrunch.com/2017/03/22/apple-has-acquired-workflow-a-powerful-automation-tool-for-ipad-and-iphone/) - but I have since discovered one gem, at least, which has continued the conversation in a most superb manner. It's [a technology podcast called *Supercomputer*](https://supercomputer.transistor.fm/about), and it's hosted by [Alex Cox](https://twitter.com/AlexCox) and [Matthew Cassinelli](https://twitter.com/AlexCox) - the latter of whom developed a significant amount of the iOS app [Workflow](https://techcrunch.com/2015/05/16/workflow-hints-at-the-future-of-the-watch-as-a-computing-platform/) (and wrote most or all of its documentation, [apparently](https://anchor.fm/davidblue),) which Apple assimilated as Siri Shortcuts. Both are extremely knowledgeable and competent commentators on - as far as I can hear, at least - virtually **the entire iOS *lifestyle***. (For those on the outside who've never stepped in: laugh if you must, but yes it *is* a lifestyle, still, and it's new thought leader [isn't exactly coming up short](https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/3/18124416/tim-cook-apple-infowars-white-supremacy-podcasts-platform-adl) these days.) iOS is technically *software*, yes, but it leaves an intractable itch for some greater, transcendent term.

In just forty minutes, without any prior knowledge about this feature, I was able to create a Shortcut which sends any given handset's IP address and precise GPS location (among other mundane metrics) in a text message **to my phone number**. I could share this shortcut among my other submissions to [Sharecuts](https://sharecuts.app/) or [ShortcutsGallery.com](https://shortcutsgallery.com/), where any iOS user could download and subsequently send this information back to *my* phone. (Don't believe me? [Have a go at it yourself](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/2873cc28684646e1904f0e80c21c8481) and I'll send back a screenshot if you'd like.) I accomplished this without any particular skills or education in software development or cybersecurity - without any real *malice*, even - I was just playing around. As far as my recollection goes, Apple has *never* included such a powerful, potentially-dangerous piece of software in a standard software update before. It's both absolutely brilliant and sortof a ripoff to be so entrusted for the first time. In many ways - like my Disable Bluetooth & WiFi shortcut - Siri Shortcuts represent an awfully half-assed solution to some of the most basic, longtime incongruencies within iOS. Sure, it's great that I can just make myself a shortcut to completely disable my phone's WiFi and Bluetooth activity with one press or Siri command (combining "type to Siri" with Siri Shortcuts basically enables a form of Command Line functionality in iOS,) but frankly, one should've expected the world's largest company to *do it themselves* in perhaps the second of third version of this operating system instead of saying *okay, here are the tools - you do it!* in its *twelfth*. 

I've found it inevitable when speaking on iOS to avoid discussing the *other* literature available on the subject at any given time. The depth to which technology media has assimilated the habits and mannerisms of a single American company is absolutely mind-boggling, regardless of its history, its market share, or even its recent trillion-dollar valuation. Dozens of media companies – *[CultofMac](https://www.cultofmac.com/)*, *[MacRumors](https://www.macrumors.com/)*, *[Macworld](https://www.macworld.com/)*, *[9to5 Mac](https://9to5mac.com/)*, [*AppleInsider*](https://appleinsider.com/), *[iMore](https://www.imore.com/)*, and... more – exist solely to cover one single independent company: **Apple, Incorporated**. One wonders how the sum total of the individuals involved with and these organizations compares with the total number of employees working for the company their careers are (for the moment, at least,) entirely centered around. (Further interesting questions: are there any comparable situations anywhere else in Western capitalism, and if not - doesn't this sort of attention constitute *some kind* of Monopoly, even if it was not necessarily an anti-competitive one?) For "reasonable people," the image one conjures up of *The All-The-Time Apple Beat* does not lend to envy, but let's choose to limit ourselves to only the most casual forms of speculation. I do not wish to mock them, for I, too remember the sensation of The Apple Drug from an unfortunate time in my childhood development when I was willing to wear a cheap sweatshirt branded with a stupid Mac vs. Windows Users joke unironically to a real live public Junior High school. There are few more embarrassing admissions, except perhaps admitting that a part of me genuinely yearns to return to this level of enthusiasm, as misplaced and cringey as it was. It's the addiction to the mystic; it's aspirational in its democratization. *Billionaires* are running the same operating system and much of the same software as I am every day - even the most followed person on any given platform is still accessing it through the same interface I might be. These are incredible truths, but they also reflect a dangerous lack of competition in a product category that has become more essential to day-to-day human life than any other in just three or four blinks of an eye.

*Fuck David Blue*, though. Who are the *real*, *hard-hitting* minds who've kept this industry and this company in check? Well, it's funny you should ask that, because the people's quirky *New York Times* tech critic of late - the esteemed [Farhad Manjoo](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/28/technology/how-to-survive-the-next-era-of-tech-slow-down-and-be-mindful.html) - has just [concluded a five-year-long technology column](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/28/technology/how-to-survive-the-next-era-of-tech-slow-down-and-be-mindful.html) with some essential (if perhaps a bit unoriginal) advice: "**just slow down**." If you're still following along, you shall surely enjoy clicking some of his links, and I would certainly encourage that you do until you're out of free articles, at least. When Manjoo speaks, Apple listens: his January decree for Apple to bend with the industry wind and build "[a Less Addictive iPhone](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/17/technology/apple-addiction-iphone.html)" is convincingly prophetic considering **Screen Time** - probably the most mulled-over iOS 12 addition. As someone who was diagnosed with Attention Deficit Disorder (however much or little that may mean to you) just one or two years after I began using my/the first iPhone, I've developed a history of what he might call *Addiction* to iPhones in variable oscillation [touching both extremes](https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/1042825995546320896). I carried my first-generation iPhone for almost 5 years - as you can imagine, it was far from a 100%-functional device toward the end of that bell curve. In contrast, I've also stood in line at dawn for two iPhone launches, jailbroken, listened to podcasts *only* about apps (far before they were good,) and been compelled to chronicle and reflect upon all of it for as long as I can remember.

There's no denying that the iPhone has had a profound effect on my life mostly thanks to my own choices, which is why it's worth telling the vast majority of you that features like Screen Time will never help you achieve whatever vague conception of *reduced usage* you may have. If you haven't yet quantified the figures you'll find within it in mental estimates, you aren't really concerned at all and if you *have*, Screen Time will only confirm them. Using reminder notifications to optimize your appflow makes no attempt at all to actually escape the mentality of the behavior you seek to lessen from yourself. Another app is still another app; a notification reminding you to stop using an app does nothing but add still more stimuli. If you want to stop using the phone so much, ***stop* using the fucking phone**. If you are truly concerned about how your handset companion has changed your life, turn it off for a week/month/quarter - however long you *possibly* can. By that, I mean no more or less than what you can manage without getting fired/dumped/expelled/etc. If you have *truly* reached this point, anything less is probably worth it. There is simply no other way to get a clear picture of how it's changed you.

Google, Facebook, and the rest of the industry are well aware of this, but know they can't *actually* advocate against the fundamental mechanism that drives their businesses, so they express concern by doing what they know: **building more software**. Apple is in a slightly different situation: they still need you to buy their phones - and even to look at them - but not past the point of hurting yourself emotionally, mentally, or physically because those injuries tend to hurt one *economically*. Screen Time's purpose is to keep us thriving and buying, but the only effective solve for this can only be communicated in garbage cinema language: **you must find it within yourself**. I am *actually* the worst person from which to model your life, except perhaps for my iPhone use: unless there's little else worthy of my attention, my phone is not out. Even if checking my [emails](mailto:davidblue@gmail.com), [Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@DavidBlue), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/neoyokel), etc are my default tasks, there are infinitely many besides that come first. Every once in a while, it's okay to finish an important message while walking down the street or waiting at a stoplight if things are urgent, but I can guarantee you that my attention is better consolidated on traveling in 95% of cases - moving with purpose and then focusing on my composition *after* I've arrived is almost always more efficient. I realize that I'm cowboying it here and sound like your Dad, but I'm better with iOS than he is, yet I've never publicly run into anything while looking down at my smartphone in 10 years of hardcore use. **Find somebody who's company makes you forget about all of this for hours at a time and treasure them**. Also: **stop playing games on your phone**. *What the hell are you doing*? Read a blog! Explore the wonders of the open web! Your peers, your battery, and your elderly future self with thank you for it. (One exception is playing word/trivia games with your partner. That's very cute and good for you.)

*I was elated to see that even Apple supports my [age-old cause for Twitter Lists](https://twitter.com/i/moments/996616971880882176). Also, the new function in Apple Music allowing the user to search by lyrics [appears to work very well](https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/1042825995546320896)...*

To get back to specifics, the **new Photos application** is now basically what it should have been all along, [3D Touch has been virtually eclipsed](https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/9/24/17896228/ios-12-keyboard-trackpad-cursor-3d-touch-iphone-ipad) for those strange bastards among you who never liked it, and the release's most democratically-redeemable feature is **optimization**, which even on my iPhone 8 Plus was blatantly noticeable and very welcome. However, probably the best insight to come out of my long, rambly *End User* review was the revelation that basically any other human activity is a better use of time than [applauding Apple](https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/17/17862236/ios-12-review-download-features-update-speed-iphone-ipad-screen-time-notifications-siri) for learning to hold new features off until they've been thoroughly tested and focusing instead on smoothing existing software. In fact, I'd argue there is absolutely no reason for someone like me to say anything even remotely positive about the world's wealthiest company ever again, though that doesn't apply to *The Verge* or Chaim Gartenberg, who's review - for the record - was much more useful to 9999 times more people than anything I'll ever write. However, isn't it sortof unreasonable to expect anything but *absolute perfection* from Apple at this trillion-dollar juncture? A handful of varying interpretations of absolute perfection per product category, even.

With gorgeous, iCloud-enabled premium apps like [Bear](https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/1063486573197561857) in the picture, integrating wholly into the Apple environment has maintained its relative rank above the alternatives to its specific minimal-esque utilitarian *niceness* which appeals so strongly to *those people* among both consumer and professional buyers. Readers from within this culture recognized a short time ago that [iOS is in the process of replacing MacOS](https://www.wired.co.uk/article/ipad-pro-2018-review) as the star component of this environment across the board, though there's at least a moderate journey ahead before it truly reaches this achievement for the median user. For myself, iOS 12 improved the experience of using my 8 Plus and certainly gave me something intriguing to play with in Siri Shortcuts. For the rest of the world's billions of daily iOS users, I say *be as insatiable as possible* - always expect more.
