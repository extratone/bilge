## Declare a Personalized Vocabulary across Apple’s OSs with Text Replacement.

If you’re like me, your cumulative experience of typing on iPhones for more than a decade is probably saturated with needlessly disruptive, unsolicited, and inaccurate autocorrection. Certain proper nouns and a dozen or so quasi-localized dialectal terms in our day-to-day writing/speech have been treated by the system's autocorrect as foreign objects, regardless of how frequently we use them. Technically, this isn't supposed to happen, but - if you've got the patience and the time - there's a native feature across iOS, iPadOS, and macOS that allows you to declare your own user dictionary called [Text Replacement](https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/use-text-replacements-iph6d01d862/ios).

You can find the Text Replacement menu on iOS - as pictured in the screenshot embedded above - by navigating to `General ⇨ Keyboard ⇨ Text Replacement` or (maybe) by tapping [this link](prefs:root=General&path=Keyboard/USER_DICTIONARY). If you think you might use it often, I'd suggest installing [**this Siri Shortcut**](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/e6d56b3fe8bc40639a60f166315f255b) I created that navigates directly to the Text Replacement menu. To be honest, I’ve no idea what you’ll find there if you’ve never created a single entry and - since there’s no way to import or export from the menu - I’m not willing to delete all of mine to find out.

Tap the plus (+) symbol in the upper right hand corner of this menu and you should find yourself on a screen identical to the one shown in the screenshot embedded above, with two text entry fields labeled `Phrase` and `Shortcut`. To simply define a phrase - like “Extratone,” for instance, we needn’t actually use the latter. I *would* suggest making two entries for those terms that aren’t always lowercase/uppercase - `Extratone` and `extratone`.
