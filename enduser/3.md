# After living and working with **[Microsoft's Surface Laptop 2](http://bilge.world/microsoft-surface-laptop-2-review-future-computing)** since its release, I've realized (intellectually) that it's more suited to my personal use than any other machine I've ever used, but my emotional brain has remained just far enough behind to stay out of the way of saying something useful.

***Spare yourself* and just read [my full written review](http://bilge.world/microsoft-surface-laptop-2-review-future-computing) instead.**
