Essential curiosities from us and our favorites.

Fucking Off West. (http://bit.ly/extrbust)
Welcome back!
We missed you, last week because former Tech Editor Hawthorn Bradley (http://twitter.com/hawthorn_jr) and I were driving the 2000 miles from Columbia, Missouri to Portland - Extratone's new home. Despite a failed attempt to slash my Jaguar's tire in Wyoming, we are safe and sound, though I am currently homeless and "liveblogging" the experience (http://bit.ly/portlandbum) .

If you haven't already, be sure to catch up on The Movie Closet (http://extratone.com/moviecloset) . Last week, they took on the One-Liner (http://bit.ly/moviecloset55) , and this week, they began October - a particular element for film podcasts, of course - by pitching Scream Queens (http://bit.ly/moviecloset56) .

Thursday night, we met up with Isiah, who offered me the chance to try virtual reality for the first time via PlayStation VR. I conceded and wrote about the experience (http://bit.ly/latevr) .

And if you're really behind, and you like to get All Fired Up & Huffy about media, have a go at my September Editor's Letter (http://bit.ly/freq16) .

"Of course. There it is. Mercilessly, steampunk. Consistently, steampunk. For Christ’s sake, steampunk."
⊳⊳ Yeah... Steampunk is awful. What's worse? When Steampunk is oblivious to its own impreialism.
"I don’t think it’s that much of a stretch to suggest that Cape Town’s affection for steampunk is ideologically bad, a way for white people to be misty-eyed about the past without copping to it."

⊚ Kazuo Ishiguro on "The Crash." (https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/dec/06/kazuo-ishiguro-the-remains-of-the-day-guardian-book-club)

⋆ Twitter Product Manager Aliza Rosen (https://blog.twitter.com/official/en_us/topics/product/2017/Giving-you-more-characters-to-express-yourself.html) : "Tweets get right to the point with the information or thoughts that matter. That is something we will never change."
⊳⊳ Those of us who've been on Twitter nearly 10 years tend to fret over even the littlest changes to the service. You could argue that the prospective increased limit may encourage Tump and his acolytes to be more articulate, but we all know it's a futile effort. I'd argue that the format should stay as it is (http://bit.ly/federatedfuture) now - anything different is not going to save or condemn the company, either way.

⊚ Sam Newhouse Jr. - owner of The new Yorker - has died. (https://www.newyorker.com/news/postscript/samuel-i-newhouse-jr-the-longtime-owner-of-the-new-yorker-and-chairman-of-conde-nast-has-died-at-eighty-nine)

About as tantelizing as it gets for media nerds - Radiolab (http://radiolab.org) 's host on Recode Media (https://duckduckgo.com/l/?kh=-1&uddg=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.recode.net%2Frecode-media-podcast) .

⊚ Mark Zuckerberg must R̵̝̼̼E̜̘̤͝P̀E̺͍̻̲̦̖͞N̳T̬̹. (https://medium.com/the-guardian/so-mark-zuckerberg-wants-to-repent-for-facebooks-sins-he-can-start-here-c4938dbd3c3a)
"Facebook has got to deal with the fact that it makes meaning in the world — it is the principal meaning maker. Through its algorithm and advertising practices, it enacts an editorial policy that is not neutral and not knowable. Facebook must begin to make editorial decisions, expose them, and defend them without running away."
