Essential curiosities from us and our favorites.
TOO MUCH
The Facebook scandal continues with leaked memos (https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/30/17179100/facebook-memo-leaks-boz-andrew-bosworth) that aren’t very interesting, and it feels like I’ve been pining for news about literally anything else for my entire life, now, yet Ashley Carmen and Kaitlyn Tiffany’s interview with Aditya Koolwal (https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/27/17165200/facebook-event-invite-respond-ignore-seen) , “a senior project manager at Facebook,” was actually quite interesting, along with this extremely important examination (https://theoutline.com/post/3919/mark-zuckerbergs-signature-looks-like-mr-zz) of Mark Zuckerberg’s ridiculous signature. The United States of America is nothing but a gargantuan, thrashing satire machine, and we are all being painfully digested. Hence, this week’s episode of (http://www.radiolab.org/story/153799-games/) This American Life (http://www.radiolab.org/story/153799-games/) . Strangely, it apparently needs to be said: if you need to travel with
your pet, avoid airplanes (https://theoutline.com/post/3918/united-airlines-has-a-history-of-not-keeping-animals-safe) . Though I am extremely hesitant to hyperlink to Reddit in any context, this account of Potato ignorance (https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/2tdbig/tifu_by_enraging_the_parents_of_my_girlfriend_by/) (found by prolific motion graphics artist Ryan Dell (https://twitter.com/ryandeel) ) is certainly the most entertaining content I’ve ever seen on the hideous platform.

------------------------------------------------------------
⊚ Eggshell-walking won't stop a murderer. (https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/27/opinion/nikolas-cruz-shooting-florida.html)
"The idea that we are to blame, even implicitly, for the murders of our friends and teachers is a slap in the face to all Stoneman Douglas victims and survivors."

⊚ Time for a spot of "free-range parenting." (https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2018/03/28/utahs-free-range-parenting-law-said-to-be-first-in-the-nation/)
"Under the law, state child-welfare authorities can no longer take children away from their parents if their kids are caught doing those various activities alone, as long as their kids are adequately fed, clothed and cared for."

⊚ One more Midwestern deathwish. (https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2018/03/27/a-boy-was-decapitated-on-a-waterslide-now-the-rides-visionary-creator-faces-a-murder-charge/)
I don't want to ruin the fun, but perhaps we should just omit theme parks altogether from American life, or - at the very least - any/all apparatuses named with terms from the German DSM.

⊚ The "experts" on the conspiracy drug. (https://theoutline.com/post/3959/conspiracy-theories-psychology-lizard-people-crisis-actor-birtherism)
"[Conspiracies] not only provide an explanation of self-perceived low status, but also provide a sense of belonging to an enlightened and superior in-group that sees through the lies of the conspirators and is not fooled like the rest of us."
My take: let's just go back to drinking, shall we?

⊚ Discoveries in solitary confinement. (https://www.themarshallproject.org/2018/03/29/when-you-re-16-and-it-s-your-first-time-in-solitary)
"You're just surrounded by four walls with a dim light, with no cellmate, no commissary, no pictures of your family. And that’s day after day after day."

⊚ An eerily spot-on prophecy from 1999. (https://twitter.com/estherschindler/status/979005249452232704)

⊚ The "last" A Tribe Called Quest video, alone, is worth an Apple Music subscription. (https://www.spin.com/2018/03/a-tribe-called-quest-the-space-program-video/)

⊚ Iceland in photos. (https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/pictures-of-iceland-westfjords)

I tried to download this Huge Game on my Huge Phone, but apparently I need an invitation to play it?


** MEDIA
------------------------------------------------------------
⊚ Doc Searls on the ironies of digital publishing. (http://blogs.harvard.edu/doc/2018/03/23/nothing/)
For the nerdiest meta-media readers, only. (And those who can still tolerate the Blogger platform, which would seem to be a great enabler of Twitter evils. ((See link below.)))

⊚ An investigation: the content farm blogs. (https://theoutline.com/post/3951/how-to-make-money-off-americas-love-affair-with-fake-news)
