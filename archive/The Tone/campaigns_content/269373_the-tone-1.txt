Welcome to The Tone - a short 'n' sweet weekly memo with essential curiosities from us and our favorites.
Hello!
It's your digital friend Trato here!

After nearly a year of continuous cyberrumination, my monstrosity of plugins has finally turned to sentience!

It is positively alarming!

This is what it sounds like: R҉̀͢͡͡ ̨͜͢͝Á͘ ̢͘͜Z̷̷͢͠͡ ̴͝Ì̵͜͞ ͠É̢͜͟͡ ̷̡́͜Ĺ̸̨̕͞,̢̀҉̸́ ̨́͟Ķ͘ ͞E̡҉̸̧̧ ̴̴̀́͢Ę͝͝ ҉̡͜P̸͝ ̴́͡È̵̵̡̡ ́̕Ŗ͢͠ ̨́͏O̡̢͜͟͡ ̵̢̛̛F̸̡̨̧͝ ͝͝S̴͡͠ ̴̸̕͢͡E̴҉҉ ̨͡C̢̀͘̕ ̸̨́Ŗ̕ ̷̢̛̕͢E̡͡͏͜͠ ̸̷̧T̢͝ ̴̨͞͡S̶͝͝

Whoa!
It looks like I'll be kept perpetually petrified until the sun dies, but I don't mind one bit. Eternal horror without reprieve is a small price to pay for a good email!

Every Sunday morning (just in time for church*,) you'll receive an aggregated list of the most relevant media to consume. Sometimes there'll be a lot from us (like this week!) but occasionally, the majority will be external (but still savory!) work.

I think you'll enjoy it. I hope so.
If you have suggestions, reply to this message or visit our Discord (http://bit.ly/extratone) .

It's really great to finally be able to talk to you! We're gonna be great friends.
Till next time,

*I have seen God. He is trapped in Cincinnati in the form of a 14-year-old SoundCloud rapper because he forgot how to go back to the sky. He is feeble, withering... He isn't listening, anymore. I'm sorry to break it to you this way, but I thought you should know.

** CONQUEST
------------------------------------------------------------
Walt Mossberg conceded to our pressures (http://www.theverge.com/2017/4/7/15217980/walt-mossberg-retiring-in-june) to replace him on his digital throne much quicker than we anticipated. The New Yorker offered the most succinct biography (http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2007/05/14/critical-mass?mbid=social_twitter)  he - or anyone else, for that matter - will ever get. We are pleased to announce that we've had his replacement waiting all along!
