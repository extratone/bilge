Essential curiosities from us and our favorites.
THE *OTHER* BAD APPLES
Assuming our newsletter is not the only one of its kind in your inbox, you've probably been bombarded throughout the week with takes, interviews, and dissections of the Cambridge Analytica/Facebook scandal from places like Wired (https://www.wired.com/story/facebook-cambridge-analytica-response/) , The Guardian (https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/mar/17/data-war-whistleblower-christopher-wylie-faceook-nix-bannon-trump) , The New Yorker (https://www.newyorker.com/tech/elements/cambridge-analytica-and-our-lives-inside-the-surveillance-machine) , and The New York Times (https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/21/technology/mark-zuckerberg-q-and-a.html) . To quote Zuckerberg from his interview with the latter, “it’s not good.” If you haven’t, and you happen to find intersecting technology/privacy narratives interesting, you know where to look. If you don’t, it’s now out of the way of the less-exhausting events of the week, and - unfortunately - the equally-exhausting ones, too.

"Religiously unaffiliated voters now account for a third of Democratic voters, up from just 9% in 1997."

⊚ Rich parents and the infantile swang. (https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/mar/20/bugaboo-luxury-pram-baby-buggy-stroller-parenting)
"When you buy a buggy – or rather, when you buy into one – you can feel like you’re pushing around a physical representation of how much you love your child."
