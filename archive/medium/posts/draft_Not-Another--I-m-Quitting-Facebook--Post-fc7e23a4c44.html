Perhaps the most diligent of these is <a href="https://twitter.com/CaseyNewton" data-href="https://twitter.com/CaseyNewton" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Casey Newton</a>, who writes <a href="https://www.theverge.com/pages/theinterface" data-href="https://www.theverge.com/pages/theinterface" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">an incredible daily-ish newsletter about Social Media</a> and recently spoke to the <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Columbia Journalism Review</em> for an <a href="https://www.cjr.org/special_report/reporting-on-facebook.php" data-href="https://www.cjr.org/special_report/reporting-on-facebook.php" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">excellent report</a> on the history of tech media’s Facebook coverage which includes a whole host of pertinent hyperlinks for your reference.

On the occasions I have tried to write about Facebook myself, I’ve always become quickly overwhelmed by the jist of everything surrounding the company and its service: <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Facebook is fucking crazy</strong>. Everything I read in research culminates in this exclamation, compounding in an urge to simply scream it over and over again in the face of each spectacle.

Acquisitions Instagram and WhatsApp have become unique in their respective segments in nuanced ways, but the user interface of the “Big Blue App” (yes, the reference to IBM’s tyrannical history is intentional) has functioned unlike any other piece of software from its conception. In this case, “different” has meant “heap of shit” from my perspective, and that of a few others. In my search of The Web for arguments confirming this opinion (ahem,) I found surprisingly little from the tech media establishment. The most comprehensive by far was from a Medium-based publication called <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">UX Collective</em> entitled “<a href="https://uxdesign.cc/did-we-forget-that-facebooks-product-sucks-471c0aca1fcd" data-href="https://uxdesign.cc/did-we-forget-that-facebooks-product-sucks-471c0aca1fcd" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">What we never talk about: Facebook has a product problem</a>.” There’s also “<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/insertcoin/2019/01/18/facebook-is-terrible-not-because-its-evil-but-because-its-terrible/#3688093b305a" data-href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/insertcoin/2019/01/18/facebook-is-terrible-not-because-its-evil-but-because-its-terrible/#3688093b305a" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Facebook Is Terrible Not Because It’s Evil, But Because It’s Terrible</a>” from <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Forbes</em>, which cites accounts of the author’s specific user experiences in its argument against Facebook’s usability as a whole:</p><blockquote name="9044" id="9044" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p">Facebook should be held to account for its role in weakening democracy and threatening privacy, but these huge scale issues miss the smaller point that Facebook is just…terrible, all on its own when you strip all that other stuff away. The entire site needs a massive overhaul, but if it hasn’t happened by now, I’m not sure it ever will.</blockquote><p name="443f" id="443f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">It’s important to note that both pieces predates <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-web-browser-redesign-interview-133006571.html" data-href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-web-browser-redesign-interview-133006571.html" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">this year’s redesign</a>, FB5, into which I opted as soon as it was offered to me (I cannot remember exactly when, but it’s been several months at least.) See <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Engadget</em> for specifics if you’d like, but any of you still using the desktop site were <a href="https://www.engadget.com/new-facebook-desktop-redesign-official-160054794.html" data-href="https://www.engadget.com/new-facebook-desktop-redesign-official-160054794.html" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">jarred into the thing itself</a> this past May. As Nick Summers notes, the incentives motivating the move should have been pure, in theory:</p><blockquote name="6304" id="6304" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p">Facebook’s redesign isn’t some wild swing for hyper growth. Instead, it’s meant for the people who still enjoy loading up the website every day or who don’t have a mobile device capable of using the company’s apps. It’s recognition that the legacy portal — the one that started Facebook’s colossal empire — deserves more than the bare minimum.</blockquote><p name="8b55" id="8b55" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">Admittedly, the update — the most comprehensive single overhaul Facebook.com has undergone yet — addressed my most aesthetically-oriented complaints with an entirely revamped design language for the first time in its history, but all of the fundamental issues with its <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">core functionality</em> remain.</p><h4 name="e51e" id="e51e" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Navigation</h4><p name="ae7d" id="ae7d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">Over and over again throughout the entirety of my 12+ years on Facebook, I have found myself unable to just <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">get where I want to go</em> on both the desktop interface and iOS app. I can’t think of anything I’d rather do less than present to you a step-by-step example in much detail, but let’s just use the draft of this Note for specificity’s sake. When I first began writing this, the “Notes” section did not appear on my profile menu as it does now (presumably because I recently published <a href="https://www.facebook.com/notes/david-blue/where-else-to-find-me/4121248871248546" data-href="https://www.facebook.com/notes/david-blue/where-else-to-find-me/4121248871248546" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">another Note</a> for the first time in years.) Entering “notes” into the search field on the Home page yielded a result called “Notes” with the original Facebook Notes icon that was, in fact, a user-created, “like”-able Page (which had ~800 Likes, if I recall, though I cannot find it now.) Now, the same query’s top result is separated from the rest in a module clearly entitled “Facebook Shortcuts,” presumably also because I’ve actually begun using Notes again. On the iOS app, the Notes section itself appears to be entirely inaccessible.</p><p name="3e96" id="3e96" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I consider myself quite adept at figuring out how to use software very quickly — not necessarily because I understand how it works on the backend any better than the average user, but because I’ve simply used <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">a lot</em>. My trouble navigating Facebook’s interface — on desktop, iOS, and Android — has remained entirely unique from that of any other service, social or otherwise, for its twelve-year duration. Without boring you to death with more links from design-centric Medium publications, I’d argue that this difficulty reflects violations of several (undefined, I promise) Core Design Principles for which I never would’ve expected to advocate. In general, I believe “<a href="https://bilge.world/google-page-experience" data-href="https://bilge.world/google-page-experience" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">good web design</a>” is a horrendous ideal against the potential creative diversity of The Web which the majority of designers should endeavor to cast off, going forward, but in the case of this — the most widely-used piece of software to ever exist — I have felt singularly compelled to cite basic UX discipline.</p><p name="e231" id="e231" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Navigating Facebook has always been a nightmare, largely because of what I’ll call <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">elemental shift</em>. In general, top-level elements should always be found where the user last left them, but Facebook has long chosen to instead arrange menus by algorithm in anticipation (I assume) of what users want. The result is a platform that — for me, at least — has always felt unsteady, like a condemned building. Moving about naturally ends up feeling aimless — there are always several different, disparate methods to accomplish a single task, it seems, and zero cohesion between them or with Home. There are remnants of “classic” Facebook strewn throughout spaces encountered in even the most casual use. This would be excusable from say, the beta version of a social network developed largely by <a href="https://bilge.world/eugen-rochko-interview" data-href="https://bilge.world/eugen-rochko-interview" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a single German twenty-something</a>, but it is absolutely absurd from the core product of The Web’s most populated service.</p><p name="b5a4" id="b5a4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In the past few years, I have discovered a sort of manual method of navigating Facebook, providing my own stability: URL pagination. Instead of searching through my Profile for the link to the Notes section, I simply type facebook.com/notes in my address bar. The same goes for /photos, /videos, /pages, etc. Another, somewhat less tedious strategy to simplify one’s desktop Facebook experience is to Ctrl-Click any navigation away from the Home screen, opening a new tab and leaving the original where you started.</p></div><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--outsetRow" data-paragraph-count="2"><figure name="a603" id="a603" class="graf graf--figure graf--layoutOutsetRow is-partialWidth graf-after--p" style="width: 51.051%;"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*2e4OqdINGgBTgQJjWlZuUA.png" data-width="2256" data-height="1407" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*2e4OqdINGgBTgQJjWlZuUA.png"></figure><figure name="bcb1" id="bcb1" class="graf graf--figure graf--layoutOutsetRowContinue is-partialWidth graf-after--figure" style="width: 48.949%;"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*7tMZW6AxDQpvNrSAQWiRVg.png" data-width="2231" data-height="1452" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*7tMZW6AxDQpvNrSAQWiRVg.png"></figure></div><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><h3 name="31c0" id="31c0" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--figure">Creation</h3><p name="e4e8" id="e4e8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3 graf--trailing">The single most sensibly designed page I’ve ever seen on Facebook’s top level domain is the homepage of the fairly-new Creator Studio (<a href="https://business.facebook.com/creatorstudio" data-href="https://business.facebook.com/creatorstudio" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">business.facebook.com/creatorstudio</a>,) which makes sense, financially: Facebook’s primary revenue stream comes from advertisements authored in the Business Tools platform (though Ads are actually managed on facebook.com/adsmanager,) where clients (or clients’ hired creative agency professionals) toil in a much prettier environment than the users they target.</p></div></div></section>
