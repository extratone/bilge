What I have long predicted is now coming to pass: Google believes it should assume control.

Parallels between Google and the 16th century Vatican abound, and last week&#39;s news about the company revealed that they&#39;re quickly losing their minds.

I have been rehearsing an especially dear pet prophecy of mine, unsolicited, to family, friends, and podcast guests since 2011 in which I end up arguing quite convincingly that Google is a dead ringer for the 16th-century Vatican: an inherently self-isolating organization with an absolute monopoly yielding <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">gargantuan </em>levels of essentially passive income from a service which nearly everybody transacts with, but only Google understands (and is therefore assumed to be its only possible provider,) which inevitably develops such a distance from the rest of the populace and their way of life (in tandem with total notoriety and celebrity among them all) not intentionally out of malice, but from the delusion of mythically-bestowed philanthropic duty that is borned of and compounded by this economic and cultural isolation in a perpetual accumulation of power and wealth that radicalizes the monopolizers — the majority already highly predisposed to zeal as they would’ve needed to be in order to find themselves in this singular, universally powerful position over every other class — and leaves their egocentric minds to wander exempt from all criticism save for that of fellow radicalized monopolizers, who together begin to feel more and more comfortable wondering aloud about themselves in increasingly fantastic presumptions: <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">what if all of this was bestowed upon us because we are superior to them? What if it is our </em><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">divine responsibility </em></strong><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">as superior beings to take charge and shepherd the common people as our sheep — for they cannot possibly know as well as we what is truly best for them?</em></p><p name="fa06" id="fa06" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">You see it, right? And you can feel a very specific flavor of terror that is both awed by the scale of the circumstances created by so few human minds and sincerely amused by the absoluteness of your own inability to alter them in any way. Perhaps you even recognize this taste as one perfected by Christianity’s ancient advertising business, but Google knows so much about you that it’s rumored to’ve been selling user data <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">to</em> the Judeochristian God for some time now at a 10% discount, and so we extrapolate and anticipate, yes?</p><p name="9de4" id="9de4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">Of course, it’s admittedly satisfying for me to deliver you to this godfearing place in the most perverse <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">look what I saw first that you didn’t see because you’re just not as bright but lucky for you, I’m so fucking generous with my wisdom </em>sort of thinking around which the entire personas and livelihoods of fringe movement fanatics are built upon, but this is my <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">one</em> thing, okay? I’ve been waiting years for the right time to formally argue this theory in depth, and — thanks to this year’s public spotlight finally pivoting on the giants who’ve been silently swallowing their competition and relentlessly forcing their already ridiculous margins higher and higher in relative obscurity for decades, the time has come, indeed.

In the time since, we’ve all grown exponentially more dependent on Google properties: billions of people rely on Google Maps for directions and, thousands of companies (including the Pentagon and other government institutions) rely on Gmail and GSuites for intercommunication, file sharing, task management, etc., and more and more academic institutions rely on Chromebook devices running connection-dependent operating systems. It’s not much of a stretch to argue that Google’s sudden disappearance would constitute a Civil Emergency in the United States, which will only become a stronger and more serious incentive for regulatory bodies to look the other way.</p><p name="7a4d" id="7a4d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Though the tangible results of advertising have been quantified significantly in the past 20 years, one can’t help but wonder after watching YouTube ads for the new Mercedes-Benz S-Class on toy unboxing videos if the companies who spend big bucks on Google advertising understand where their money is going, but they know that if they <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">don’t</em> advertise there, their competitors will. This, of course, is a fundamental practice of a monopoly, and it’s yielded Google so much fucking money that they cannot possibly spend it fast enough, as evidenced by <a href="https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2017/4/27/15409672/google-calico-secretive-aging-mortality-research" data-href="https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2017/4/27/15409672/google-calico-secretive-aging-mortality-research" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">their investments in life extension</a> — so that, perhaps, they will have more time on Earth to figure it out.</p><p name="0cdb" id="0cdb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">When you build a collection of the world’s smartest people in a <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/googles-monastic-vision-for-the-future-of-work" data-href="https://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/googles-monastic-vision-for-the-future-of-work" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">self-sufficient environment</a> that discourages exploration of other lifestyles and ideas, and you sustain the society with a gargantuan, relatively low-maintenance revenue stream, you create a culture which is not only well-primed for isolationism, but is also extremely inefficient. In fact, with its <a href="https://www.computerworlduk.com/galleries/it-vendors/google-graveyard-3508070/" data-href="https://www.computerworlduk.com/galleries/it-vendors/google-graveyard-3508070/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">vast collection of abandoned products and properties</a>, Google must surely be one of the most inefficient companies in history. Thinking back on recent software releases along with its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/4/16405184/rick-osterloh-interview-new-google-hardware-vision-htc-deal" data-href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/4/16405184/rick-osterloh-interview-new-google-hardware-vision-htc-deal" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">recent entries into the hardware space</a>, Google is also one of the worst competing tech companies. Very little aside from Gmail, Google Photos, Google Maps, and Chrome have found their place or garnered significant usership. Google Play Music is unintuitive and impossible, Google Allo and Google+ are all but forgotten addendums to other services, and Google Search — its core, original function — has been <a href="https://theoutline.com/post/1430/google-finally-realized-that-racist-search-results-are-a-problem" data-href="https://theoutline.com/post/1430/google-finally-realized-that-racist-search-results-are-a-problem" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">out of control</a> for years, and all of them are designed blandly and excruciatingly tiring to look at.</p></div></div></section><section name="6bf5" class="section section--body section--last"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><h3 name="9544" id="9544" class="graf graf--h3 graf--leading">Google Shun</h3><p name="c1d3" id="c1d3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">If this all has stirred nothing more in you than a desire to eliminate Google from your own online life as much as possible, there <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">are </em>alternatives in almost every one of the sphere’s they dominate. As of late, <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/about" data-href="https://duckduckgo.com/about" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">DuckDuckGo</a> has accumulated a fair amount of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global/2018/may/19/google-facebook-security-data-duckduckgo" data-href="https://www.theguardian.com/global/2018/may/19/google-facebook-security-data-duckduckgo" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">buzz and coverage</a> as a private, more relevant alternative to Google’s plain old search engine. Though it is clever enough to list us as the first result for “extratone,” I’ve found it simply insufficient as a replacement in my own life because, essentially, it rarely delivers what I’m looking for. By contrast, <a href="http://dropbox.com/paper" data-href="http://dropbox.com/paper" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Dropbox Paper</a> is such an elegant cloud notetaking and word processing software that it makes Google Docs look simply idiotic (and warrants its own review very shortly.) For getting around, know that <a href="https://www.mapquest.com/" data-href="https://www.mapquest.com/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">MapQuest</a> is not only <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/does-mapquest-still-exist-as-a-matter-of-fact-it-does/2015/05/22/995d2532-fa5d-11e4-a13c-193b1241d51a_story.html" data-href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/does-mapquest-still-exist-as-a-matter-of-fact-it-does/2015/05/22/995d2532-fa5d-11e4-a13c-193b1241d51a_story.html" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">still around</a> — it’s now a very competitive mobile navigation app.</p><p name="41dd" id="41dd" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I, myself, have allowed Google as complete of access to my information and behavior as possible because I believe “privacy” is a completely futile endeavor if one wishes to be a part of society, though I do often use alternatives to Google services simply because I <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">fucking hate</em> the way they look. If you want a more complete list of services and software that allow one to shun the Google God entirely, you’ll be forced to seek out less dignified sources like <a href="https://lifehacker.com/5876794/going-google-free-the-best-alternatives-to-google-services-on-the-web" data-href="https://lifehacker.com/5876794/going-google-free-the-best-alternatives-to-google-services-on-the-web" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Lifehacker</em></a> and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/antigoogle/" data-href="https://www.reddit.com/r/antigoogle/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Reddit</a> and decide if the additional time you’ll spend using most of them to accomplish the same tasks is really worth your digital angst.</p><p name="4647" id="4647" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">If Google were to be more explicit with its users and staff about its aspirations to take over control of our lives, there will be little to do but accept the future they intend to create because they’ve long been too powerful to control. In the meantime, I’d suggest you continue to use whatever software works best for you and refrain from wasting your time fretting on conspiratorial suppositions of what the tech industry may be doing to “invade your privacy,” because there is no longer any such thing, nor will there be ever again. However, I would also urge to you worship your own Gods, whomever they may be, for Google will never be worthy. I, for one, shall only pray to our Mother Sun.</p></div></div></section>
