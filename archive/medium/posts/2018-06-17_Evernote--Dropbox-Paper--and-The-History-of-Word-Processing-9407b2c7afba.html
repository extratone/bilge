I was cruising my pitifully ugly Google News feed on an October afternoon in 2015 looking for the last little bit of material for <a href="http://bit.ly/drycast43" data-href="http://bit.ly/drycast43" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener noopener noopener" target="_blank">the evening’s episode of <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Drycast</em></a><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">, </em>when I happened to spy the words “<a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/evernote-is-in-deep-trouble-2015-10" data-href="http://www.businessinsider.com/evernote-is-in-deep-trouble-2015-10" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener noopener noopener" target="_blank">Evernote is in Serious Trouble</a>.” I doubt I screamed or anything, but I definitely remember experiencing a very real, full-body shot of adrenaline because <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">my entire creative life </em>was contained at the time within the nearly 40,000 notes I’d amassed on my Evernote account since the service’s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120904074223/http://blog.evernote.com/2008/06/24/evernote-public-launch/" data-href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120904074223/http://blog.evernote.com/2008/06/24/evernote-public-launch/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener noopener noopener" target="_blank">open beta</a> in 2008. In fact, I was in that very moment using it for the live show notes and so began to wonder how I could possibly continue if Evernote were to be suddenly killed dead. For better or worse, though, the “unicorn” would indeed survive to see its tenth birthday this year, though it’s arguably been eclipsed by the notetaking, journaling, and word processing services its features predated and for which it was the most significant forerunner not so long ago.</p><p name="25f9" id="25f9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I’d been using the cloud-synced notetaking service for all of my composition and research gathering since Junior High, when I thought myself extremely clever with my cloud-syncing, iPhone-native notetaking app when I’d watch other students struggling to find a flash drive or log in to their email on school library computers. Since it worked with any browser and my password was memorable (before the brute force apocalypse and the need for password managers,) I could access my documents, mp3s, and images <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">from anywhere, </em>which was actually a pretty big deal — especially as more research and notetaking was required in high school.</p><p name="b1a8" id="b1a8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Yes, 10 years later, we are <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">swamped</em> with infinite duplicates of documents from our personal clouds, which are now inescapable and plenty — they follow us around from our pockets, purses, and backpacks and rain notifications down upon us for single punctuation mark peer edits, unnoticeable modification conflicts, or sometimes just for the hell of it. There are now what seems like infinitely many available ways to enter, edit, and publish text from wherever you happen to be, and most of them are free, but very few are actually pleasantly executed tools — all of which can all be said of most types of software now. Since tech publications (and even tech <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">bloggers </em>now,) aren’t doing software reviews anymore because you won’t click on them, the task of comparing between the lot so that you might be spared having to mess around with <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">all </em>of them to find out for yourself — the function of consumer journalism — has fallen to myself, alone because the <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Fear of The Unclicked</em> is not known to me.</p><p name="d03d" id="d03d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">To assist me in bearing this terrible burden, you can allocate 1–3 minutes to <a href="http://bit.ly/howwewrite" data-href="http://bit.ly/howwewrite" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener noopener" target="_blank"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">take the survey I created</strong></a> about the text-entry tools you use<strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong"> </strong>to determine which tools people use at different points in their writing process and across several uses.

Surely I don’t need more than that! </em>Technically, she’d be correct in a major sense: Word has been able to sync via Microsoft OneDrive between PC or Mac with iOS or Android for a while now, but I wouldn’t vouch for the latter for any use other than reading or very lightly editing a document because the relationship between the mobile apps and their desktop counterparts is inevitably strained. Because Microsoft Word is such old software, it’s filled with some obscure functionalities I’m sure even its creators have forgotten. Over years and years of development, these tools have been stacked on top of one another so that actually mastering the labyrinth could be a college major in and of itself.</p><figure name="80df" id="80df" class="graf graf--figure graf--layoutOutsetLeft graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*rl_BI59MukNgHAW_mBQMdA.png" data-width="2278" data-height="1068" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*rl_BI59MukNgHAW_mBQMdA.png"><figcaption class="imageCaption"><em class="markup--em markup--figure-em">As of May 29th, 2018</em></figcaption></figure><p name="e508" id="e508" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">Basically, you can tell your grandmother that <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Microsoft Word is a huge old bitch</strong>, but it’s still the industry standard for formatting and publishing works at the end of the line.

It was okay when I couldn’t afford to pay for a license in high school (and saw no reason to,) but it now looks sort of awful, especially considering that the version of Office (and therefore Word) to which I’m comparing its screenshots is actually <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">also</em> from 2013.</p><p name="595b" id="595b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The other, “fresher” open source option of the moment is called <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">LibreOffice Writer</strong>, and its suite has been attracting a fair amount of praise — I think “<a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/libreoffice-the-best-office-suite-gets-even-better-with-libreoffice-6-0/" data-href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/libreoffice-the-best-office-suite-gets-even-better-with-libreoffice-6-0/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener noopener" target="_blank">every bit as good</a> [as Word]” is taking things a bit far, but its sixth version looks significantly better than OpenOffice on <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">my</em> machine, at least, and generally operates more smoothly as well. That age-old banner of <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Open Source</em> won’t matter for much longer, though, if all kinds of software continue to be abandoned and substituted with Progressive Web Apps for <a href="http://bit.ly/uselists" data-href="http://bit.ly/uselists" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener noopener" target="_blank">no damned reason</a>. Considering how much time some of us have already spent in front of Word, it’s no wonder we’re spoiled: even my 5-year-old edition of Microsoft Office syncs with the app on my iPhone (with some pleading,) and looks <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">extremely </em>crisp. As far as paid featured desktop-class alternatives, there’s just one more: <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">WordPerfect</strong>, which I have never used or heard anyone else mention.</p></div><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--outsetRow" data-paragraph-count="2"><figure name="a9db" id="a9db" class="graf graf--figure graf--layoutOutsetRow is-partialWidth graf-after--p" style="width: 49.773%;"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*snNyu6W3gInyrg0wN6x5aQ.png" data-width="2560" data-height="1373" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*snNyu6W3gInyrg0wN6x5aQ.png"></figure><figure name="2534" id="2534" class="graf graf--figure graf--layoutOutsetRowContinue is-partialWidth graf-after--figure" style="width: 50.227%;"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*XGN3s8xMbpzmBByPqKlm6g.png" data-width="2560" data-height="1360" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*XGN3s8xMbpzmBByPqKlm6g.png"><figcaption class="imageCaption" style="width: 199.096%; left: -99.096%;">Microsoft Word 2013 (left) vs. OpenOffice 4 (right)</figcaption></figure></div><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><h3 name="e173" id="e173" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--figure">The Hybrids</h3><p name="bd4f" id="bd4f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">When it was conceived, <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Evernote</strong> pioneered the recipe that now serves as the foundation of the feature development in today’s notetaking and journaling applications, as evidenced by CEO Phil Libin’s unapologetic use of the term “<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2009/12/30/evernote-two-million/" data-href="https://techcrunch.com/2009/12/30/evernote-two-million/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener noopener noopener" target="_blank">life-logging</a>” in 2009, which sounds bizarre in retrospect because we’re now well-accustomed to easily “snapping geotagged photos” (smartphones had always included location data in their photo files’ meta, but Evernote was the first app to give a user access to the data <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">on their device</em>,) “making voice notes,” or and organizing text notes via advanced categorization and metadata-enabled searchability.

Because synced entries in Evernote are not live-updated like those in Google Docs or Dropbox Paper, it’s possible to modify or add to a note on one device while it’s open (and static) on another, which is addressed by either duplicating the most recent entry and filing it in the default “Conflicting Changes” folder, or pasting the duplicate of the entire contents above the “old” content in the note, separated by a horizontal line. I’ve yet to figure out the behavior that triggers which fix, but I don’t particularly care — I’ve decided to restrict my Evernote use to my desktop, absolutely.

And yet, neither WordPress nor any of the software I’ve covered thus far achieve much progress toward an ideal, comprehensive word processing solution.</p><figure name="c384" id="c384" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*g_06lJ4s48KqMUdtjrimEw.png" data-width="1600" data-height="776" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*g_06lJ4s48KqMUdtjrimEw.png"><figcaption class="imageCaption">Dropbox Paper’s in-browser experience is absolutely sublime.</figcaption></figure><p name="f2c7" id="f2c7" class="graf graf--p graf--hasDropCapModel graf--hasDropCap graf--hasDropCapImage graf-after--figure"><span class="graf-dropCap"><img class="graf-dropCapImage" data-image-id="1*kT4UBOq3zkDvSi5QG2--Eg.png" data-width="3244" data-height="3344" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/400/1*kT4UBOq3zkDvSi5QG2--Eg.png"><span class="graf-dropCapText">T</span></span>hat’s why I’d like to talk about <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Dropbox Paper</strong>, which has been my own browser’s homepage and primary text editor since <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/8/4/12373696/dropbox-paper-ios-android-sharing-docs" data-href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/8/4/12373696/dropbox-paper-ios-android-sharing-docs" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener noopener noopener" target="_blank">its public beta went live</a> in August of 2016, and it’s very hard not to dote on considering that it is definitively the single most useful software addition in my whole computing life. It’s a live-updating exclusively web-based (for now) service with an emphasis on collaboration, just like the industry-standard monstrosity that is <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Google Docs</strong>, but it’s been designed from the ground-up to perform best the operations you need most from a word processor in 2018, which doesn’t include advanced layouts, fine-adjustable paragraph and/or letter spacing, Excel integration, or voice dictation, but simply… typing and re-reading and editing. You’d be surprised what a handy productivity catalyst can become of a simple white, live-updating space without distraction available no matter where you are or what device you’re in reach of.</p><p name="a933" id="a933" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Virtually <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">all </em>of my “process” is now conducted within Paper, and I’ve never before experienced such an unconscious assimilation of use. I write about software because I’ve used a lot of it and I’ve been able to count on my ability to find fundamental mistakes/designed ignorance in most everything. Dropbox Paper, however, is so keenly perfect for my own needs that I slipped unconsciously into total, daily dependence upon it without noticing the transition at all, which has never, <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">ever</em> happened before. Notes can begin from blank Text/Title fields to <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Brainstorming</em>, <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Meeting Notes</em>, and <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Project Overview</em> templates. In April, the team <a href="https://blogs.dropbox.com/dropbox/2018/04/dropbox-paper-templates/" data-href="https://blogs.dropbox.com/dropbox/2018/04/dropbox-paper-templates/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener noopener" target="_blank">introduced the ability</a> to “templatize” any document, which I’ve yet to explore but will no doubt make full use of for show notes when <a href="http://extratone.com/futureland" data-href="http://extratone.com/futureland" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener noopener" target="_blank"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Futureland</em></a> is revived.

Instead of tags, categories, or “notebooks,” Dropbox Paper’s folders are its singular method of categorization, and they are astoundingly sufficient, even when editing multiple documents simultaneously or digging through professional and personal entries within a single account — all thanks to its search function, which is super-swift and superior to any other service because of its profound simplicity. It’s one of many experiences which laughably shame past efforts in the design of these tools: without any customizable search filters or metadata and <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/help/paper/find-docs" data-href="https://www.dropbox.com/help/paper/find-docs" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener noopener" target="_blank">by sifting only through title, content, and author</a>, any note in Paper can be found <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">instantly </em>no matter how dated or obscure. I doubt I’ve yet to top 1000 entries quite yet (there’s no easy way to count, and <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">why should there be</em>, really,) but on several occasions I’ve found years-untouched, untitled documents within seconds — a process which has <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">never</em> been brisk or convenient in Evernote.</p><p name="9d46" id="9d46" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Though Dropbox Paper wasn’t necessarily designed for composing 5000+-word longform, it’s by far the best tool for the vast majority of the pre-publishing process (to a reasonable extent, of course — I wouldn’t use it for a screenplay or novel manuscript.) It’s rare for me to utilize its mastery of collaboration, these days, but there’s frankly little reason to go anywhere else — including Google Docs — considering that Paper documents can be bound by the same viewing and editing permissions: by individual entry or folder, marking live modifications with clean, color-coded initials in the sidebar, by email or rogue URL for editing, commenting, and/or reading. (The comments interface is the best I’ve ever seen by a wide margin.) Users can be assigned and “pinged” for tasks using “@,” and it’s reasonable to assume that permissions won’t ever present an issue for my own use considering they haven’t already. To a limited extent, notes can be easily “published” via shared links yet remain editable in realtime, making Paper perfect for obscure-but-public reference documents like <a href="http://extratone.com/style" data-href="http://extratone.com/style" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener noopener" target="_blank">our style guide</a> and <a href="http://extratone.com/redirection" data-href="http://extratone.com/redirection" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener noopener" target="_blank">redirects catalog</a>.</p><p name="45b8" id="45b8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">From the onset of use, you’ll marvel at how fucking fast and smooth the in-browser experience is regardless of your device’s age or dimensions. Surprise surprise — the iOS app works just as smoothly and is laid out vaguely like a Twitter client. “Browse” — the chronological timeline of documents — occupies the leftmost bottom button as “Home” — the main timeline — does in Twitter’s app, and “Notifications” is likewise the same icon (practically) in the same position in both, and the items themselves are even grouped with rich card-looking content previews. Perhaps these nods to my Twitter muscle memory have contributed to my own unusual bias, but I suspect it shares components with a particular demographic of professional writers. As I understand the day-to-day activities of a feet-on-the-pavement reporter, Dropbox Paper is a necessity in a ridiculously all-encompassing sense. With its Slack integration, <a href="https://blogs.dropbox.com/dropbox/2017/03/paper-hidden-gems/" data-href="https://blogs.dropbox.com/dropbox/2017/03/paper-hidden-gems/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener noopener" target="_blank">super high-usability design</a>, collaborative modularity, ultra copy-and-paste-friendly text, smooth hyperlink behavior, light weight, and ultimate compatibility, it should be evangelized as a no-brainer option in journalism. <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Fuck</em> a Bic &amp; steno.</p><p name="8416" id="8416" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Web Clipping may be completely alien to its vocabulary, but you can drag and drop documents in just about any format for a beautifully-embedded preview. Conveniently, <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/help/paper/dropbox-integration" data-href="https://www.dropbox.com/help/paper/dropbox-integration" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener noopener" target="_blank">they won’t even count against your Dropbox upload quota</a>: “Dropbox Paper doesn’t place a limit on the number of docs you can create, and includes unlimited version history regardless of the Dropbox plan you are on.” Naturally, this is subject to change in the future, but I’m 95% positive that Paper has yet to refuse any of my uploads because of their size or format, and many of mine are extraordinarily huge.</p><p name="1e67" id="1e67" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">There is a perfect power to Paper which I can only beg its stewards to leave unmolested for as long as possible. If I was a billionaire, I’d immediately purchase it from Dropbox and leave everything to the company — revenue, janitorial development, user data, etc. — except the right to make any significant feature or functionality additions to the user experience, as I have never before felt this way about a single service or program… <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">ever</em>. I’m not sure if I should keep quiet or incessantly kiss ass, but my interest undoubtedly lies in preserving Paper as it is. If you’re left doubting my own testimonial, there are a billion throwaway “Ditch Google Docs for Dropbox Paper” posts across the B and C-list technosphere. <a href="https://www.gizmodo.com.au/2017/02/5-reasons-you-might-ditch-google-docs-for-dropbox-paper/" data-href="https://www.gizmodo.com.au/2017/02/5-reasons-you-might-ditch-google-docs-for-dropbox-paper/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener noopener" target="_blank"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Gizmodo’s</em></a>, for instance, notes Paper’s superior formatting freedom, intelligent footprint, incredible embed flexibility, and… independence from the terrible Google God.</p><figure name="5844" id="5844" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*_nReNJ4_RTmtfALnw7Ivdg.png" data-width="1600" data-height="900" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*_nReNJ4_RTmtfALnw7Ivdg.png"><figcaption class="imageCaption">Dropbox Paper for iOS.</figcaption></figure><p name="21a6" id="21a6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">Right now, one’s choices in notetaking apps for iOS are almost <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">too</em> varied.

I recall installing it on my 6S Plus, then, after spying some screenshots of its multicolored notes, but I failed to find room for its use. When the (completely useless) Files app was added with iOS 11, I played around with it for a bit and somehow ended up setting Zoho as the default application to open PDFs which inadvertently launched my 8 Plus into an infinite loop of “Open __ in __?” prompts that eventually required deletion of Notebook in order to view them at all. I tend to especially adore these programs in their early, innocent versions when they smell most of innovation before their creators are inevitably brought back to our filthy reality when their VCs start expecting <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">money</em>. Zoho Notebook should have bewitched my affections, but my short trial was clunky and disastrous and those beautifully-colored layouts weren’t quite worth the trouble, so they were missed — to no consequence at all.</p><p name="d517" id="d517" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The latest favorite is <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Bear</strong>, the Markdown-supporting app with which <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">The Verge</em>’s Casey Newton <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/2/14785264/evernote-replacement-bear-app" data-href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/2/14785264/evernote-replacement-bear-app" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener noopener" target="_blank">replaced Evernote for his own use</a>, last year.

I had a go at Bear’s free iOS experience and saw little functional difference from DayOne — if anything, text didn’t look quite as sharp — but its reported integration with Siri Shortcuts is intriguing.

I’d suggest you give it a try — especially if your desktop-class machine is a Mac — and for your sake, I would hope they choose to utilize the power of the modern browser with a web interface in the future. “As a writer, I work in text, and text ought to be simple,” Newton opined, likely with more brevity than I’m capable of in this discussion.</p><p name="e185" id="e185" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Much of anything has yet to be written about these offerings in 2018, but I must insist both regular and intermittent writers alike give Dropbox Paper a try. I suspect you’ve less “privacy” to “lose” than you would in Google Docs, and its sublime function as a writing tool extends from workplace collaboration to shared grocery lists with your SO and long, image and hyperlink-saturated works like this one. It’s very difficult to break — even by pasting fragmenting code or Zalgo text; it’s never out of date, and always a short, teeny pageload away even across the worst of connections. As someone with an unhealthy obsession with his written work, I can tell you that its UI is by far the most anxiety-relieving I’ve ever used. As an alternative to Google Docs, I would point out that 1) Docs supersedes Paper in sum features <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">significantly </em>less than you’d think and 2) for the one or two weird formatting challenges it fails to complete, neither Microsoft Word — the old bitch — nor Docs are going anywhere, and Paper exports to both of them directly.</p></div><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--fullWidth"><figure name="09ee" id="09ee" class="graf graf--figure graf--layoutFillWidth graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*s_AX0CO8ht6_woI1kcU_7A.jpeg" data-width="4032" data-height="3024" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2560/1*s_AX0CO8ht6_woI1kcU_7A.jpeg"></figure></div><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><h3 name="ed01" id="ed01" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--figure">The Future</h3><p name="7e60" id="7e60" class="graf graf--p graf--hasDropCapModel graf--hasDropCap graf-after--h3"><span class="graf-dropCap">C</span>uriously enough, I was required to use every single method of text retention of which I am capable in the course of writing this piece, as I tripped over my laptop’s charging cable — a physical connection, yes (and with substantial leverage) because Apple won’t allow other computer manufacturers to make use of “their” ingenious magnetic charging solution which they’ve included as “MagSafe” on MacBooks since 2008 — perhaps inevitably ruining the port and leaving me with only my iPhone and pens.

Thanks to my fiancé’s generosity, I type this bit now on her Panasonic R440 Electric Typewriter, which must still be considered a legitimate means of writing text in 2018 if only because of <a href="https://theoutline.com/post/2488/collin-andrew-yost-the-most-hated-poet-in-portland" data-href="https://theoutline.com/post/2488/collin-andrew-yost-the-most-hated-poet-in-portland" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener noopener" target="_blank">Instagram poetry</a>.

If there is anywhere to be caught clacking away on a typewriter out of preference (I’d hesitate to call even my own situation one of <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">necessity</em>,) in 2018, it would undoubtedly be Portland, yet I am still extremely embarrassed to be the source of all this racket and would immediately perish if any of my neighbors bothered to track it down.</p><p name="6277" id="6277" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Even this very sophisticated example of the typewriting species is limited by one’s supply of both ink and erasing ribbon, though either can still be found for sale, remarkably. I am even less able to easily correct mistakes than those I wrote by hand because I feel a significant pang of pain via my mechanical empathy every time I use (or accidentally misuse) the function which whites out text with a sickening <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">clunk</em>. There’s something about this process which makes it feel more taxing, costly, and timeconsuming than any other, but perhaps with time and extended use, my embarrassment, empathy, and hesitance would fade and I’d become a cruel, loaded God of shitty prose, but I have no intention of finding out. I’ll willingly concede that restored or refurbished typewriters can be <a href="https://twitter.com/FickleCrux/status/923340941129170944" data-href="https://twitter.com/FickleCrux/status/923340941129170944" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener noopener" target="_blank">absolutely gorgeous</a>, and there’s probably some validity in the “distraction-free writing environment,” but I’d suggest that anyone who’s pounded out any significant chunk of copy knows that one must find a groove of absolute focus within a word processor in order to complete work with any efficiency or cohesion, anyway. I’m as connected as any of you, yet these days, I always end up <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">hyperfocused</em> on Word, Dropbox Paper, and/or research in my browser to the exclusion of anything else on the machine, whether or not I intend to do so. I’m no authority, but I can’t see a functional place for a typewriter in 2018.</p><p name="c54a" id="c54a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Portlanders, surely, are vain enough to avoid leaving such disastrous drafts laying about, though now’s a good time to note that one can now scan their typewritten document into a word processor using native software on their smartphone, nowadays, if they’re so unreasonably inclined. Using iOS default Notes app, I could scan this physical draft into Portable Document Format with just a few steps, but doing so would contribute to the ridiculous perception that Adobe’s ancient, clunky standard is the ultimate end of the line for any and all digital publishing. Yes, it’s ridiculous to consider “25 years” of development led to PDF 2.0’s release <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">just last year</em>, to nobody’s glee outside <a href="https://theblog.adobe.com/taking-documents-to-the-next-level-with-pdf-2-0/" data-href="https://theblog.adobe.com/taking-documents-to-the-next-level-with-pdf-2-0/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener noopener" target="_blank"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">The Fucking Adobe Blog</em></a> (which I do believe is running on Medium, hilariously.)

This “<a href="https://youtu.be/LxviGskApcw" data-href="https://youtu.be/LxviGskApcw" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener noopener" target="_blank">Virtual Reality prototype</a>,” for instance, surpasses even <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">The Soul Ledger </em>as the most distressing online video of all time.</p><p name="3f8c" id="3f8c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">Just <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">32.3%</strong> of survey respondents claim they print “<strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">at least one draft and use a pen or pencil to make notes/mark corrections by hand</strong>,” not including the additional <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">6.5%</strong> who “<strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">print at least one draft but make all corrections digitally</strong>,” leaving <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">61.3% </strong>who presumably do not physically print at all throughout their writing process. Our survey is broad, rudimentary, and not entirely scientific, yes, but I would bet these numbers would contrast significantly with those from respondents exclusively in academia. For myself and my colleagues, there remains “<em class="markup--em markup--p-em">something</em>” that can only be attained by physically manifesting written work, perhaps in requirement of tangible manipulation in order to thoroughly comprehend large bodies of information. As I’ve passed 100,000 words within the rough draft of my novel project, no amount of skimming on any sized screen has enabled me to catch the typos and inconsistencies which become <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">immediately </em>obvious as soon as I have the most current printed manuscript in my hands. I doubt even total immersion into one’s work via some VR-capable word processor would do much to assuage this discrepancy — or much at all, for that matter, aside from casting writers into their own special hell. Surely, only the most self-loathing of them would voluntarily choose to be so dunked. (Read: drowned.)</p></div></div></section>
