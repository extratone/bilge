In the name of progress, I’ve done my best to make a point of looking back, too, yet something astonishingly personally relevant managed to slip past me until just last week: <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">there is a sixth version of the Tweetbot app</strong>. At this moment, <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/tweetbot-6-for-twitter/id1527500834" data-href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/tweetbot-6-for-twitter/id1527500834" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">it is listed on the App Store</a> as an “Early Release” version, though its predecessor can still be downloaded by those who’ve already purchased it in the past, like me. This is an unusual practice — usually, pre-release versions of iOS apps can only be distributed through Apple’s developer beta testing infrastructure, though Testflight. Notably, Tweetbot developer company Tapbots was <a href="https://twitter.com/tapbot_paul/status/1354145779494100992?s=21" data-href="https://twitter.com/tapbot_paul/status/1354145779494100992?s=21" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">apparently required</a> to take down Tweetbot 5’s store listing 30 days before releasing Tweetbot 6.</p><figure name="2ae3" id="2ae3" class="graf graf--figure graf--iframe graf-after--p"><iframe src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F982358308&amp;show_artwork=true" width="700" height="145" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></figure><p name="4348" id="4348" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">I can’t remember exactly why — though I suspect I was just fucking around on my phone before bed, bleary-eyed — but the implications of this next numeral passed me by the first time I saw and downloaded Tweetbot 6, two weeks ago. Perhaps it’s because the app didn’t appear to have any new features — in fact, it’s technically got <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">less</em> than 5, though those that have been removed — user-specified URL shortening, image hosting, and video hosting services — haven’t worked in a good while anyway. As my old fav, <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">The Verge</em> noted in <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/26/22250899/tweetbot-6-tapbots-ios-app-update-subscription-service-twitter-api" data-href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/26/22250899/tweetbot-6-tapbots-ios-app-update-subscription-service-twitter-api" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">their coverage of 6</a>, blame for these omissions rests solely on Twitter, Inc., itself, who’s continued to hold its API development inordinately close-to-chest. I didn’t bother to find out about this, though, because my first assumptions upon poking around the new app — especially after encountering its new subscription requirement in order to use any of its substantive features — was that its developers had ceased any actual time investment into the app long ago, and that 6 was a new version in number and rudimentary visual updates, only, shoved out in hopes of peaking old, loyal users like myself enough to get us to download it, at least. In the disappointment I’d already expected, I closed and immediately deleted the app.</p><p name="39d6" id="39d6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I’ve paused everything else to write you on this, though, because the story is actually much bigger. Had I investigated any further that first time, I would have discovered an odd amount of buzz coming from even the most mainstream of tech media in a simple search. (Yes, I am ashamed about it.) You’re still reading, but perhaps — as I was, originally — you are doing so from an appropriately-jaded, well-read perspective on software, generally, in 2021. Perhaps you’re looking at the search results, yourself, and wondering if you’re dreaming. <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Dedicated coverage of a fucking third-party Twitter client iteration??? At this point in history? What in fuck?</em> I’m fairly certainly neither of us are, though: fucking Tweetbot made headlines on <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tweebot-6-tapbots-twitter-app-subscription-model-launch-110526052.html" data-href="https://www.engadget.com/tweebot-6-tapbots-twitter-app-subscription-model-launch-110526052.html" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Engadget</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/26/tweetbot-6-released-with-new-subscription-pricing/" data-href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/26/tweetbot-6-released-with-new-subscription-pricing/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">TechCrunch</a>, <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/01/26/tweetbot-6-new-features-subscription-model/" data-href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/01/26/tweetbot-6-new-features-subscription-model/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">9to5Mac</a>, <a href="https://www.macstories.net/news/tweetbot-6-moves-to-subscription-pricing/" data-href="https://www.macstories.net/news/tweetbot-6-moves-to-subscription-pricing/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">MacStories</a>, <a href="https://www.imore.com/tweetbot-6-update-popular-twitter-app-and-it-brings-subscription-model" data-href="https://www.imore.com/tweetbot-6-update-popular-twitter-app-and-it-brings-subscription-model" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">iMore</a>, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/01/26/tweetbot-6-subscription-pricing-change/" data-href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/01/26/tweetbot-6-subscription-pricing-change/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">MacRumors</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/extratone/bilge/blob/main/docs/tb6links.md" data-href="https://github.com/extratone/bilge/blob/main/docs/tb6links.md" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">others</a>. No, it’s not 2010 again. In fact, <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">The Verge</em>, at least, has never given up on Tweetbot. If my long term memory had been functioning, I would have remembered noticing its spot in “<a href="https://www.theverge.com/platform/amp/22187376/best-iphone-apps-2020-apple-ios" data-href="https://www.theverge.com/platform/amp/22187376/best-iphone-apps-2020-apple-ios" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">12 great apps for your new iPhone in 2020</a>:”</p><blockquote name="d3f9" id="d3f9" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p"><em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em">Twitter is a vaguely terrible way to spend your time these days, but if you (like me) can’t tear yourself away from the social media service / entryway into hell, you’ll want Tweetbot, which actually makes using Twitter far less painful. Tweetbot shows you the tweets of the people you follow, in the order that they tweeted them. There are no ads or promoted tweets, powerful mute filters to block out unwanted noise, and (thanks to Twitter’s unfriendly API changes) no notifications to constantly ping you to come back to the app.</em></blockquote><p name="53c9" id="53c9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">Here’s to Chaim for exposing me to a perspective I never would have otherwise considered: Tweetbot’s lack of push notifications as a <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">positive</em>. If you’re wondering, no, this new app does not ~yet~ include any additional notification integration, and it’s not clear whether or not it’s on Tapbots future roadmap for the app, or where. As for the reality of integrating Tweetbot 6 into your current Twitter use, I stand by my argument that deleting the native Twitter app isn’t really an option if you plan to ever view your notifications on your phone. The popular assumption (I assume) if you’re still reading is that you are a “poweruser,” meaning details about my own configuration are probably irrelevant. If by chance you’ve just downloaded Tweetbot for the first time, you should take the time to disable notifications for Tweetbot entirely, but leave them on for the native Twitter app, even if you decide to banish it to your App Library. Before I began any work on this review, I made sure to swap in Tweetbot 6 where the native app had been in my dock for several years, now. I originally pushed the native app all the way to page 6, but immediately found this extreme. Instead, I put it in the bottom-right corner in my second screen, as you can see in the screenshot below (which also serves as proof, if you needed it.)</p><figure name="b982" id="b982" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*DxnN1ffnhmFirOfBO8alvw.png" data-width="2568" data-height="2778" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*DxnN1ffnhmFirOfBO8alvw.png"><figcaption class="imageCaption">Proof.</figcaption></figure><p name="5abf" id="5abf" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">I should also note how much my own engagement on Twitter has diminished in the past 3–5 years. Not to manifest tiny violins — in turn, my engagement on (and investment in) <a href="http://bit.ly/dbmasto" data-href="http://bit.ly/dbmasto" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Mastodon</a> has increased exponentially, and it’s of a <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">much</em> higher quality. I bring it up for context’s sake: I can afford to prioritize Tweetbot in my Twitter use because of how few daily notifications I get — a number which is unusual for someone who uses Twitter as much as I do. Inevitably, my own use is once again going to factor heavily in this work, as is the significance of my relationship with Twitter, generally, in my life. If you didn’t already know, I’ve met basically all of my friends since high school through Twitter. As of this moment, my private “Friends” Twitter List includes 149 accounts, and I’ve spent more than 10 years, now, reading almost every single one of their Tweets. I have been as critical of the service as anyone, but — whether or not either of us are willing to acknowledge it, wholly — I believe the intimacy of this arrangement to exceed that of any in-person relationship <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">I</em> have ever had. Reading the random thoughts of these people seconds or minutes after they’ve popped into their heads for all this time has been an experience unique to the format Twitter pioneered, if not to the service, itself. I have no choice but to acknowledge that I am <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">deeply</em> invested in not just Twitter, but Twitter’s less-than-visible Lists feature, emotionally and intellectually. When I hit my <a href="https://twitter.com/neoyokel/status/1281646353102147584" data-href="https://twitter.com/neoyokel/status/1281646353102147584" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">follow limit</a>, several years ago, Lists also became my single means of acquiring new connections on the network. If it were to be removed, I would lose this ability, entirely, as well as any reasonable means of communicating with any of my friends.</p><figure name="3025" id="3025" class="graf graf--figure graf--iframe graf-after--p"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IO-ZSD-vymc?feature=oembed" width="700" height="393" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></figure><p name="a037" id="a037" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">Perhaps you understand, now, why I have <a href="https://bilge.world/twitter-lists" data-href="https://bilge.world/twitter-lists" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">written</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/i/events/996616971880882176" data-href="https://twitter.com/i/events/996616971880882176" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Tweeted</a> so extensively about Lists. You should also understand just how miraculous the possibility of Tweetbot’s new future now seems, personally, unless you’re new to all of these ideas and don’t feel like reading that big olé Tweetbot 5 review of mine (which is fine.) Before I go into the history of Tweetbot, let me first share the single most telling feature in Tweetbot of Tapbots’ belief in using Lists and share some evidence of <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">others’</em> present day belief in Tweetbot. Shamefully, I’ve spent several years — tens, if not hundreds of thousands of hours — using Lists in Tweetbot, oblivious to its upmost Lists integration: “<a href="https://tapbots.com/support/tweetbot6/tips/list.php" data-href="https://tapbots.com/support/tweetbot6/tips/list.php" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Use Lists as Timeline</a>.” Had I actually bothered to look at the support docs at any point, I would have discovered this long ago, which would have almost certainly made my given year. <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">If you use Tweetbot and Lists, for the love of Gourd, please take a look</strong>. Here’s what those docs currently say, in full:</p><blockquote name="7ab3" id="7ab3" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p"><em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em">One long time Tweetbot feature is the ability to use any of your lists as your main timeline. To do this, all you have to do is hold down on the “Timeline” label in the navigation bar (in the timeline tab) and a menu populated with your lists will appear. Select one and that will become your current timeline. You can switch to another list or back to your main timeline any time by performing the same action.</em></blockquote><p name="4807" id="4807" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">Even after reading this multiple times, it still was not obvious to me what it was talking about, and I was unable to find precisely <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">zero</em> visuals on The World Wide Web of this action taking place, so I recorded and uploaded <a href="https://youtu.be/IO-ZSD-vymc" data-href="https://youtu.be/IO-ZSD-vymc" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the video embedded above</a>.

Perhaps you’re still looking for a comprehensive picture of <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">what using Tweetbot as one’s main Twitter client looks like in 2021</strong>.

Last week, it (apparently) committed to the worst possible user-side content monetization model concept out of the dozens that have dipped in and out of rumor for virtually the service’s entire history: “<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/feb/26/twitter-to-launch-paid-super-follow-function-that-lets-users-charge-for-content" data-href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/feb/26/twitter-to-launch-paid-super-follow-function-that-lets-users-charge-for-content" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Super Follows</a>” are slated to shade our collective experience with putrid <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">freemium</em> concerns. “<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/25/22301375/twitter-super-follows-communities-paid-followers" data-href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/25/22301375/twitter-super-follows-communities-paid-followers" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Communities</a>” sound in concept like a worthwhile and genuinely value-adding feature addition for actual Twitter users, but any substantial expectations of the company feel far too risky to invest in. All the while, Twitter Spaces — the audio-only Clubhouse-ish mutilation of Periscope’s corpse — has been silently bestowed upon a secret set of @s at an achingly slow pace. I don’t know about you, but I still haven’t even fully digested fucking <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Fleets</em>, yet.</p><p name="509d" id="509d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">What does Tweetbot 6 really offer you, Twitter user, in 2021?</strong> <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Freedom from all of that bullshit.</em></p><p name="4d0c" id="4d0c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It’s just occurred to me how much more anxious the movements of Twitter, Inc. and Jack Dorsey’s horrendous facial hair would be making me if I had not discovered an (ironically) more stable, wholesome platform to replace them, years ago.

The timing of its release has proved awfully convenient, just predating the aforementioned catastrophe of disjointed features that has descended harder than ever before on Twitter’s own app, leaving it an absolute mess. When I initiated the symbolic swap maneuver documented at the very beginning of this review, I assumed I was going to find Tweetbot awkward to use as my primary in the present day, but have found the opposite to be true. The social network Tweetbot draws from is barely recognizable as the same property it drew upon originally, when its Lists-loving configuration was simply one of a dozen different interpretations of how one should interact with Twitter (by far the sharpest, I think we’d agree.) Tweetbots, in contrast, is virtually identical in principle, though the unwavering bearing of its development has resulted in the true definition of <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">refinement.</em> The result is the most <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">beautiful</em> way to use Twitter in 2021, no competition, and is also crucially the singular means of interacting with it on one’s “own terms” — as long as yours align with The Lists Method, that is — in an environment that feels predictable and fundamentally <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">at your control.</em></p><p name="3c20" id="3c20" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">As much as I have <a href="https://youtu.be/LdBFMibyh3Y" data-href="https://youtu.be/LdBFMibyh3Y" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">praised the Mastodon app Toot!</a> as the most innovative social app available — and will continue to do so until I encounter something more original and ingenious — it’s perhaps the singular remaining cleverly playful Tweetbots feature which first opened my perspective to appreciate little Easter egg-like tricks. Indeed — even after all we’ve been through together these past ten years — you can still cycle through all of Tweetbot’s visual themes by <a href="https://imgur.com/gallery/A1zbhLq" data-href="https://imgur.com/gallery/A1zbhLq" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">two-finger swiping vertically</a> in 6. Quick Account Switching is the other less-than-obvious swipe function of note, which I’ll rely on an embed stolen from Tapbots themselves to demonstrate:</p><p name="387f" id="387f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><a href="https://imgur.com/gallery/oiwfBdQ" data-href="https://imgur.com/gallery/oiwfBdQ" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">https://imgur.com/gallery/oiwfBdQ</a></p><p name="c575" id="c575" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I don’t think it should ever feel natural to speak sentimentally about mobile apps, but Tweetbot is a worthy exception. If you glance over the respective comments sections of the articles and YouTube videos I’ve hyperlinked, you’ll pick up on this phenomena of legacy Twitter users chucking back some tragically nostalgic sentiments in response to the reminder surfaced by the Tweetbot 6 news of just how long we’ve been doing this. From my perspective, the <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">other</em> majority sentiment found there catalyzes the bizarre chronobending at play even further. I can’t believe how many folks continue to be flabbergasted by the idea of <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">paying for software</em> in 2021, but I’ve been literally begging Twitter to charge me a monthly fee in exchange for some greater curative capabilities for as long as I can remember. The whole of my gospel, again, is that Tweetbot 6 has personally made using Twitter a little bit better than bearable, so I have no other reasonable choice available: I’m paying the fuck up.</p><figure name="fbab" id="fbab" class="graf graf--figure graf--iframe graf-after--p"><iframe src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F980081788&amp;show_artwork=true" width="700" height="145" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></figure><div name="4a30" id="4a30" class="graf graf--mixtapeEmbed graf-after--figure graf--trailing"><a href="https://github.com/extratone/bilge/issues/59" data-href="https://github.com/extratone/bilge/issues/59" class="markup--anchor markup--mixtapeEmbed-anchor" title="https://github.com/extratone/bilge/issues/59"><strong class="markup--strong markup--mixtapeEmbed-strong">&quot;Tweetbot 6 for iOS Review&quot; · Issue #59 · extratone/bilge</strong><br><em class="markup--em markup--mixtapeEmbed-em">Tweetbot 6 on the App Store Tweetbot 6 released with support for new Twitter API, now a subscription|based app |…</em>github.com</a><a href="https://github.com/extratone/bilge/issues/59" class="js-mixtapeImage mixtapeImage u-ignoreBlock" data-media-id="73a73f75828f9f5e14c65c38a7f58329" data-thumbnail-img-id="0*Yd_iaxrQl5vO1yef" style="background-image: url(https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/fit/c/160/160/0*Yd_iaxrQl5vO1yef);"></a></div></div></div></section>
