There’s virtually zero chance that I’ll shout over other voices of music criticism as long as <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Bilge</em> remains so poorly optimized for SEO, and Portland, Oregon has been far too confusing to deprive myself the opportunity to work out <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">any</em> understanding of its youth culture. It’s not a lack of talented musicians in the area — the opposite is true — but a severe drought of the kind of tragedy and trauma which ultimately give acoustic American musical expression <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">its whole shit</em>. What I caught of the weekend’s invasion with Santa Cruz musicians were all praiseworthy, tight and confident performers who’d obviously invested heavily in their equipment and their presence here. <a href="https://joekaplow.bandcamp.com/" data-href="https://joekaplow.bandcamp.com/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Joe Kaplow</a> arrived with a sort of bespoke magazine rack containing 20 neatly-arranged effect pedals, leading me to wonder for a moment if I was about to witness <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">banjo powerviolence</em> for the first time, but he explained that he simply preferred their availability, and wouldn’t use “more than a few at once,” and seemed almost genuinely perturbed by my attempt to explain the specific industrially-influenced involvement of audio hardware in hardcore punk and grind performance which I was referring to with the term. (“Powerviolence” has apparently become an ambiguous one around these parts, and I’m sure he was actually just <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">utterly uninterested</em>.)</p></div></div></section>
