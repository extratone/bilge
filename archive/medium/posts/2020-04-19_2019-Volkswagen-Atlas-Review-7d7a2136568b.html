Just about any review you watch or read will mention this.

Obesity is still a problem in America, but it’s our automobiles now.

I spent 2018 driving a 1976 Lincoln Continental Mk. IV around — the second-longest two-door car ever sold at 228.1 inches from its pointed nose to its massive ass. Despite being a full <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">thirty inches longer</em> than the 2019 Atlas, my 460-powered mammoth yacht weighed some 700 pounds <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">less</em>, and it was filled with <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">real wood</em>. I’m no expert in physics by any means, but I can tell you that every pound has <a href="https://www.nrcan.gc.ca/sites/www.nrcan.gc.ca/files/oee/pdf/transportation/fuel-efficient-technologies/autosmart_factsheet_16_e.pdf" data-href="https://www.nrcan.gc.ca/sites/www.nrcan.gc.ca/files/oee/pdf/transportation/fuel-efficient-technologies/autosmart_factsheet_16_e.pdf" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">expounding effects</a> on the energy required to move, turn, and stop a vehicle, which just about sums up the ultimate formula to <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/2009/10/29/greenlings-how-does-weight-affect-a-vehicles-efficiency" data-href="https://www.autoblog.com/2009/10/29/greenlings-how-does-weight-affect-a-vehicles-efficiency" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">pulverize efficiency</a>.

The best potential hoot to be had from it as a driving device should be sought by ordering it to shuffle briskly on curving country blacktops in Sport Mode with all the assists (save for lane-keeping) <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">on</em>. Not to be too crude, but it’s fun to make the fat fucker run. Through your ass, you can feel the suspension squirm and struggle to redirect all <a href="https://www.motortrend.com/cars/volkswagen/atlas/2018/2018-volkswagen-atlas-se-long-term-update-1-review/" data-href="https://www.motortrend.com/cars/volkswagen/atlas/2018/2018-volkswagen-atlas-se-long-term-update-1-review/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">266 lb.-ft. of VR6 oomf between 4 wheels</a> beneath an entirely separate war against the physics of such top-heavy body roll.</p><p name="22d7" id="22d7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Scrambling</em> is definitely the correct verb. Pleasantly light steering in Comfort Mode (where I’d advise you leave it in virtually any situation) combined with a supple-ish ride from multilink suspension provide a trace of a past luxury sentiment not unlike the energy exhibited by my old Connie through and through. It’s all about the sensation of <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">power</strong>. Not in the horse sense, but in the satisfaction achieved from the manipulation of maximum mass with minimum effort. Comparatively, the level of actual ego-stroking is of course quite miniscule, and unfortunately, it is the numbness that is most noticeably left over with very little gain.</p><p name="d9c4" id="d9c4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Also unfortunate: I did not end up making the opportunity to truly test whatever offroad capabilities the Atlas may posses in any sort of formalized test. My example came with Hill Descent Control and Hill Start Assist, and I was able to find a small hill just steep enough to <a href="https://youtu.be/REchJ_BD5G0?t=232" data-href="https://youtu.be/REchJ_BD5G0?t=232" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">trigger the former</a>. I cannot say I’d put my money on the Atlas winning the Dakar as it is, but we now know it can handle wet grass on a mild incline. What about county road gravel? Realistically, these are the two extremes 99% of Atlas’ will ever face in their usable service lives. I found an entirely quiet section of back rock road and <a href="https://youtu.be/REchJ_BD5G0?t=321" data-href="https://youtu.be/REchJ_BD5G0?t=321" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">walked through the steps</a> to disable all of the traction and stability control assists before stomping on the throttle, but was unable to provoke any significant wheelspin.

In truth, neurotypical people are naturally driven to minimize risk, yet also to romanticize the sick, inhibitionless madmen — to envy them both internally and externally (in a most restrained way.) Collectively, our authority in (or mastery of) risktaking remains pathetically irrational.

The car immediately behind me hesitated no more than necessary, but the Biggest Big Infiniti behind them (a QX80 — the Atlas’ competitor) just… stopped. There was honking and frenzied, hoarse screaming of <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">what the fuck are you doing?</em> and such.</p><p name="200a" id="200a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I responded with pleasantly amused but relatively-encouraging glances at the impersonal black mass of the Infiniti’s windshield through my mirrors. I rolled down the Atlas’ driver’s side window and politely gestured that they go around me, but failed to coax any movement whatsoever from the ugly behemoth through at least two full cycles of the nearby traffic light. There must be some aquatic authority in the bulbous black ass of the QX80, for no one behind it seemed willing to pass either. The driver waited significantly longer than you’d imagine before emerging, huffy. She was wearing a classic poofy black North Face vest some sort of slate gray turtleneck. Nothing below these were stimulating enough to retain any memory of. <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Uggs?</em></p><p name="ec08" id="ec08" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">How positive are <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">you</em> that the truth has absolutely zero consequence: contrasted silver-beige eyeliner and little eye contact, dirty-ish straight blonde hair over a spray-tanned face, exhibiting zero anxious tics or hesitation. She was obviously the New Matriarch, and she was obviously <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">much</em> more of an authority on traffic law than I. As she approached, she scanned the street as one naturally does when they enter a busy one… except it was completely empty, thanks to her blockade. She first informed me that I was “not <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">supposed</em>” to be stopped there. I tried to listen and respond with as much sincerity as possible as I realized all at once that my behavior had genuinely <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">perturbed</em> this woman — that her choice to leave the huge hideous warmth of the guppy wagon to speak as humans to one another required great courage.</p><p name="7415" id="7415" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I inserted the next logical question which I’d been screaming telepathically: <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">can you not get around me?</em> I began to pity her when I then saw in her face the distinct possibility that <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">going around</em> as a concept had not occurred to her whatsoever. She stuttered a wee bit in retorting “I could go around, but I don’t want to get a ticket.” Here, one of the most fascinating avenues of suburban psychology is explored: Guppy Mom is not being ingenuine with this expression, nor has she had an untoward experience with law enforcement, ever. Guppy Mom did know her excuse was bullshit — nobody has ever been written a traffic citation for carefully circumventing an obstacle in the road. Given the opportunity to interrogate this kernel of entirely uncompromising obedience to utterly delusional traffic law superstitions, I think we’d simply discover a life of unnaturally positive interactions with LEOs. We must conclude, then, that the source of her fear was either myself or the Atlas.</p><p name="c65c" id="c65c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Granted, to her I am still a <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Young Man</em>, and am therefore instinctively programmed to believe myself more informed than literally everyone — even the very foundational architects of modern civilization. Her Stucco Highness may have felt a representative of these builders (edgy take: <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">she is in fact their servant</em>.) Her own folks surely complain regularly about their distaste for disrespect, and my gig-economy, Austin Powers-looking ass was somehow disrespecting the order laid down by her would be (entirely fantastical) forefathers. Though her expression of her quaint fear of such “ugliness” (if you will) is hard-headed, an ugliest decision of hers (or her kin) idled behind me, its giant seafood-looking mouth gaping, unhinged. It’d almost be more redeemable if it was a hardcore, chronic mouthbreather.

Maybe it’s not fair to compare the driving experience to my previous long-term vehicle, the slightly smaller Mazda CX-9, but in my opinion the Mazda still sets the ride and handling bar for the competitive set. Setting the Mazda aside, if you hop behind the wheel of one of the newer competitors like the Kia Telluride, there’s a noticeable disparity in the refinement in ride quality and body control in the Atlas… <strong class="markup--strong markup--blockquote-strong">Volkswagen should have made the GTI of three-row SUVs, not just another minivan alternative</strong>.</blockquote><p name="780b" id="780b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">This pullquote from <a href="https://www.thecarconnection.com/overview/volkswagen_atlas_2018" data-href="https://www.thecarconnection.com/overview/volkswagen_atlas_2018" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Andrew Ganz’s <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">The Car Connection </em>review</a> is as good a summary as I could ever come up with:</p><blockquote name="bdb5" id="bdb5" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--blockquote-strong">The 2018 Volkswagen Atlas does little wrong, but it’s light on personality and a little low-rent inside — and it guzzles fuel.
