This is especially puzzling given the overwhelmingly positive experience I was privileged to have with one 2014 Volkswagen Jetta TDI Sportwagen over the past year. It would find me signing up to Facebook groups, using real Fast Boy terms, revisiting long-lost roads of home, and returning to my local community in an extremely intimate ridesharing stint. Throughout it all, the Jetta made me smile much <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">much</em> more than I would’ve thought. I found a real love for this relatively simpleton form of transportation that I <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">should</em> have seen coming, but did not at all. There is something delightfully indulgent about a manual-equipped diesel wagon.

I need one</a>.” I really did intend on becoming The Jetta Man (perhaps without the fashion.) In acquiring it, my plan — and it was a good plan — was to cease an era of general insensibility in my life’s decisions by entombing my wayward self within the most sensible expression of modern automotive design I suspected I could live with. The wagon component joined with diesel power and a manual transmission upon casual research. Diesel, manual, wagon — of the people’s car, these I sought. Nay, <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">demanded</em>.</p><p name="61c0" id="61c0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">An ex-girlfriend of mine drove an utterly decimated Mk. V Jetta Sedan which she’d acquired in some sort of dicey deal. I remember finding it surprisingly robust given its lot, and quite dynamic to drive. We traveled all over the Midwest in it — from central Missouri to Des Moines to Chicago to Kansas City and back again. I mocked, but it was everything one could hope for in cheap transportation and quite a bit more. It turns out, Volkswagen was shooting high.

In my research, I had to specifically investigate the Jetta’s name before reading anything about it. When an American thinks of “Jetta,” they unconsciously dissociate the word from the “jet” sound and make <a href="https://carstereotypes.com/car-stereotypes/volkswagen-jetta-stereotypes/" data-href="https://carstereotypes.com/car-stereotypes/volkswagen-jetta-stereotypes/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">largely unsophisticated jokes</a>.

This also was news to me, and <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">I</em> try to keep up with the industry.</p><p name="403b" id="403b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In 2011, the Mk.

Compared to the Mk. V, “Volkswagen made it clear that the targets are once again the strong-selling Civic and Corolla.” Once again, I’m at a loss for experience in the equivalent extra-Volkswagen competition, save for the <a href="https://youtu.be/40x4TF-6ggc" data-href="https://youtu.be/40x4TF-6ggc" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Chevrolet Cruze</a> and Kia Forte.

It’s been too long since I last drove my ex’s Mk. V to really have much to say, but I do remember a particular solidity about the steering — perhaps because it was still hydraulic. Once again, I’ll rely on Tony:</p><blockquote name="de0d" id="de0d" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p"><em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em">Less obvious cost cutting includes the loss of adjustability for the center armrest, a lack of lumbar adjustment in most models, no more power-reclining seatbacks, and a simpler stability-control program that can no longer be shut off or even reduced.</em></blockquote><blockquote name="f32c" id="f32c" class="graf graf--blockquote graf--empty graf-after--blockquote"><br></blockquote><blockquote name="7140" id="7140" class="graf graf--blockquote graf--empty graf-after--blockquote"><br></blockquote><p name="b9d1" id="b9d1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">When I began searching for my first ever truly modern car in February 2019, I surprisingly only needed to pass up a single option in the Kansas City area before I found The One: a 2014 post- <a href="https://youtu.be/SvokGhOaHGg" data-href="https://youtu.be/SvokGhOaHGg" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Dieselgate</a> example with ~65,000 miles on its odometer in “Deep Black Pearl” with a “Cornsilk Beige” interior which had been previously owned only by a single Michigan cyclist.

I’d walked around and cold-idled another, high-mileage Sportwagen, but I was committed to getting something with a light-colored interior after the red velvet cake Lincoln and my dank smoking room-dark XJR.</p><figure name="35ed" id="35ed" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="0*rHtPH3ehn9iwR462.jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="785" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*rHtPH3ehn9iwR462.jpg"></figure><p name="3daf" id="3daf" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">Three of us walked into a dealership in the middle of a frigid Kansas afternoon — Jack, my girlfriend Sierra, and I. We hovered by a smart, gleaming little Golf GTI whilst my salesman, Charles, retrieved the car I had found online. After he finished copying my driver’s license while the little diesel warmed up, the four of us set off into suburban Lawrence. Back when the Mk. VI Golf was released, I attended a Volkswagen dealership event in which Mk. V and Mk. VI GTIs were driven back-to-back — I’m assuming to reassure buyers that yes, they <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">really had</em> made it better (though I was quite vocal in my disagreement about this, to the dealer’s chagrin.) The car I bought immediately reminded me more of the former — perhaps I just enjoy the increased body roll of a 50,000+ mile suspension — albeit with a much longer wheelbase and significantly more torque. Rowing through the gears, I was immediately impressed and bewildered by the characteristics of the 140-horsepower, 236 lb.-ft.-developing diesel powerplant. The diesel engines I grew up around in tractors, combines, and other heavy machinery were designed to more or less remain at a constant, relatively low RPM for the majority of their use cases. It’s not a screamer, but the idea that a diesel engine can <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">rev</em> at all was something that took a bit to wrap my head around. However, it is almost immediately evident that carrying on to the 6000 RPM (?) redline is a futile and incorrect practice. There is nothing at all to be found up there.</p><p name="a6aa" id="a6aa" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I’ve driven some quick straight-line cars in my time, but none of them have delivered their power anything like the Jetta’s long-distinguished 2.0L inline-four. It’s very odd having comparatively so little actual horsepower, yet so much torque — I’d heard Jeremy Clarkson complain about diesel power coming in “great lumps,” but I’d already started to find them extremely (and positively) amusing in my first few minutes. When asked, the oil burner will produce protracted front tire squeal and torque steer from a stop, which is odd and hilarious coming from such an otherwise docile automobile. Also hilarious: Charles likely noted that Jack, Sierra, and I were (and are) entirely unafraid of facing The End when a very near collision during our test drive did not perturb us in the least, but left him huffing and puffing from adrenaline. He was a star, though, throughout the more than four hours of deliberations required for his institution to reckon with my credit history. Eventually, I ended up spending almost exactly $12,000, which was probably too much, and named my new automobile Martin — “Marty” for short — after Martin Winterkorn, the former CEO of Volkswagen AG who <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-05-03/ex-vw-ceo-winterkorn-charged-by-u-s-in-diesel-cheating-case" data-href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-05-03/ex-vw-ceo-winterkorn-charged-by-u-s-in-diesel-cheating-case" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">bore more than his share of the blame</a> for Dieselgate, including <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/16/18369528/vw-ceo-martin-winterkorn-dieselgate-germany-volkswagen-emissions-scandal" data-href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/16/18369528/vw-ceo-martin-winterkorn-dieselgate-germany-volkswagen-emissions-scandal" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">charges of fraud</a> by the German government. <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Dirty diesel rolling coal in prison</em>.</p><h3 name="0672" id="0672" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Naughty Diesel</h3><h3 name="48d2" id="48d2" class="graf graf--h3 graf--empty graf-after--h3"><br></h3><p name="995f" id="995f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">By “post-Dieselgate,” I mean that my new car was a part of <a href="https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a15344947/whats-volkswagen-doing-with-all-those-repurchased-diesels/" data-href="https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a15344947/whats-volkswagen-doing-with-all-those-repurchased-diesels/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Volkwagen’s $10 billion buyback program</a>, so the Michigander sold it back to the manufacturer for its “fair replacement value” — <a href="https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a15347930/volkswagen-settles-diesel-emissions-violations-for-14-7-billion-even-more-fines-to-come/" data-href="https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a15347930/volkswagen-settles-diesel-emissions-violations-for-14-7-billion-even-more-fines-to-come/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">between $12,500 and $44,000</a> according to <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Car &amp; Driver</em> on behalf of FTC chairwoman Edith Ramirez.

Surprisingly, the modern People’s Car feels quite stable at this speed — were it not my own automobile, I’m not sure I wouldn’t just travel this fast everywhere. In the past few years, Interstate 70 — which cuts Missouri just about in half from West-East, connecting St. Louis and Kansas City with my hometown in the center — has become significantly faster-paced than I remembered it before moving to Portland for two years. 80mph used to be the accepted number, 70 (the actual speed limit) was the unenforced minimum. In my old Toyota pickup, I could travel at 65 without attracting too much criticism. <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Now</em>, however, one must maintain 85 to keep up with traffic, especially when traveling with commuters. 90–95 will no longer garner judgmental looks and 100mph left-laners are given a pass.</p><p name="a37c" id="a37c" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“I’ll bet that’s great on the highway” is probably the most regular comment received from passersby and riders right after “is this a diesel!?” (Really, the fact of my Jetta’s existence as a manual-equipped diesel wagon seemed to utterly astound a great many people.) There is truth in this general supposition: the ability of the diesel powerplant to deliver hill-climbing torque at low RPM is simply unmatched by gasoline powerplants of the same displacement, which means that “highway” driving entails virtually zero downshifting — arrive in sixth gear, set the cruise control, take a nap. Everything else is taken care of. There is a definite luxury in the knowledge that one is no longer needed in the process at speed — luxury that is NOT present in a gasoline-to-manual Jetta drivetrain.

While traveling from Kansas City back home in the East one day, I decided to satisfy a longtime bucketlist item and stop by a weigh station. As I drove up to the scale, the police-uniformed attendant looked up at me from his glass box and gave <a href="https://twitter.com/rashadpls/status/650114296937058304" data-href="https://twitter.com/rashadpls/status/650114296937058304" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the standard white guy smile frown</a>. It took a moment for the scale to register Martin, but it eventually displayed a whole <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">3440</strong> <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">lbs</strong>. My little “compact” wagon… weighed significantly more than one and three-quarter tons — just 528 lbs. less than the <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BJPe6rWAcnr/" data-href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BJPe6rWAcnr/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">full-sized, supercharged V8-powered Jaguar saloon car</a> I call the automotive love of my life, and almost a full 200 lbs. more than <a href="https://www.caranddriver.com/reviews/a15129379/2011-volkswagen-jetta-gli-20-tsi-review/" data-href="https://www.caranddriver.com/reviews/a15129379/2011-volkswagen-jetta-gli-20-tsi-review/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">its GLI sedan sibling</a>.

Upon lifting up the base of the “car-go” area in the rear, I found a <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">full</em> steel spare wheel — some 30 lbs of it at least — which I immediately removed, along with some sort of flapping cargo restraint that I can only suspect was designed to keep objects (like dogs, perhaps) in the cargo area from sailing into the passenger compartment during an accident (it’s called the “luggage compartment cover” in the <a href="https://eileenlong-my.sharepoint.com/:b:/g/personal/david_eileenlonglcsw_com/Ecdms0tdr6dBoMWScrKX8PsBkIJMmYNjOfzFX3oy-UUO-A" data-href="https://eileenlong-my.sharepoint.com/:b:/g/personal/david_eileenlonglcsw_com/Ecdms0tdr6dBoMWScrKX8PsBkIJMmYNjOfzFX3oy-UUO-A" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">owner’s manual</a>.)

Then, at a red light, I felt some rough dips in the engine’s idle. When I reached home minutes later, I turned off the ignition and removed the key only to find the fans still spooling. I was convinced I had already broken the car somehow in rough driving, but in reality, Marty was in the process of <a href="https://dieselnet.com/tech/dpf_regen.php" data-href="https://dieselnet.com/tech/dpf_regen.php" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Diesel Particulate Filter (DPF) Regeneration</a> — a procedure designed to clean the little shitpot under the hood by heating it up some thousands of degrees to burn off built up diesel exhaust soot.

Perhaps it’s because this is by far the most modern car I’ve ever spent this much time with — the <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">only</em> car I’ve ever spent so much consecutive time with, in fact — or because I did, indeed, grow up sitting (and standing) right next to 8-liter turbodiesels at full chat for hours on end. Compared to my mother’s 1.4L gasoline-powered Mk. VII sedan at idle in her garage, there is a more pronounced clacking, but it’s nothing you’d have any trouble sleeping through. I would know!

Frankly, I can’t think of any vehicle more suited to what ridesharing actually entails than a diesel Jetta wagon. It’s a relatively spacious and comfortable place to be for four adults — certainly when no trip lasts longer than thirty minutes — with a ridiculously stout cargo capacity. I was able to fit <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">9</em> freshman fraternity guys in for a short trip once. Their faces were all genuinely somber as one expressed “it’s really hard having 8 friends when we try to go out.” (No, you’re not supposed to accept those rides.) It was a challenge carrying some 1500 lbs. of Sad Boys, mostly for the brakes. Once, a group of young men and women began to make fun after noticing the DIESELGEEK decal I’d stuck on my side’s rear quarter window (which I’d acquired with a new <a href="https://www.dieselgeek.com/products/high-performance-vw-shifter-shaft-bushings-for-mk4-golf-jetta-new-beetle?variant=6292541866027" data-href="https://www.dieselgeek.com/products/high-performance-vw-shifter-shaft-bushings-for-mk4-golf-jetta-new-beetle?variant=6292541866027" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">shifter bushing kit</a>.) “So are you a diesel geek?” they asked, jeering to themselves, to which I responded: “you know, it’s so weird you mention that because I know this place that sells these stickers…” They no longer seemed amused.</p><p name="857e" id="857e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">All of the cars I’ve owned have been attention-grabbing in their own way — my old Toyota pickup was adored by the locals; my Miata was adored by other Miata owners. My XJR was gorgeous and my Swamp Continental seemed to be passionately coveted by absolutely everyone over 40. With the Jetta, though, I did not expect any unusual attention whatsoever, yet I must confess that more conversations were started about it than of all of the others, combined. Ridesharing will do that, yes, but it is ridiculous how many people of all races, classes, and ages were enamored by — or overly curious about — Martin.</p><blockquote name="9af2" id="9af2" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p"><em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em">What is this a Jetta, dude?

News vans parked in a converted horse stable. They farm televisions out there. A few minutes into the ride, after picking up the young woman, I noticed in the rearview mirror out of my eye’s corner that she had put down her phone to watch my right hand with total bewilderment. Eventually, she asked “what are you doing to the car?” She’d never heard of a manual transmission before. I did my best to explain, but when she asked “but why wouldn’t you just buy a regular car?” I did not have a sufficient answer. Unlike many automotive enthusiasts, I think it’s totally okay that people are allowed to exist independent of this knowledge. There are many, many other things in life to worry about. <a href="https://dieselgoth.com/automatic-transmission-inefficiency" data-href="https://dieselgoth.com/automatic-transmission-inefficiency" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">80% of cars sold in the United States</a> are shipped with automatics and expecting every young person who lives in an urban environment to think about automobiles as anything beyond simple transportation is asking a lot.</p><p name="a8ca" id="a8ca" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">While we’re on the topic of manual transmissions, it’s relevant to mention how excellent the Jetta TDI is as a vehicle to teach first timers how to operate one. With the clutch in, the engine will not rev beyond 3500 RPM thanks to an electronic limiter, which dramatically reduces the number of obligatory stalls when learning clutch control. The learner can simply hold the accelerator to the floor as they get the hang of declutching instead of having to receive shouts of “more gas!” repeatedly. Of course, being a diesel further eases those stresses with much more readily available torque. Sierra was able to grasp the basics this way in a <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">single night</em>, which is unprecedented in my experience. She found particular comfort in the suggested gear indicator on the instrument panel’s main information display, which is very conservative, naturally, but also apparently relief from some great anxiety regarding the question <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">which gear should I be in right now</em>?</p><h3 name="a71c" id="a71c" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Community</h3><h3 name="6bdf" id="6bdf" class="graf graf--h3 graf--empty graf-after--h3"><br></h3><p name="6035" id="6035" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">I have derided Facebook for my entire adult life for its shitty design, inaspirational effect on its users, and its massive intellectual power, but strangely, through Jetta ownership, I was able to find a community on the service that couldn’t be found elsewhere.
