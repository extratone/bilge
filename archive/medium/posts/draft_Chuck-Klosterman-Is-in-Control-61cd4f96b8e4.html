I am willing to submit myself for punishment for these transgressions under the single condition that I be allowed to call him <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Cuck Klusterfuck</em> the next time he ends a spoken sentence with “or whatever” in an interview — a terrible habit he’s maintained for years. If my own byline had any pedigree in the world of literary criticism, I would now collect his penance simply by including those hateful, 90s stoner-kid buzzwords in every quote, unedited, but it most certainly does not. I’ve searched moderately hard for any reason to bother with any criticism of books or their authors and returned with very little. I’ve read <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">The Broom of the System</em> and <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">White Girls </em>this year, yes, but I’d have to be a <a href="http://www.revelist.com/books/books-fuckboys-read/3289" data-href="http://www.revelist.com/books/books-fuckboys-read/3289" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener noopener" target="_blank">Fuck Boy</a> to write anything about David Foster Wallace, and <a href="https://www.interviewmagazine.com/culture/hilton-als-white-girls" data-href="https://www.interviewmagazine.com/culture/hilton-als-white-girls" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener noopener" target="_blank">Hilton Als’ elegant, genre-busting masterpiece</a> is so far beyond both my societal rights and perceptive ability that I wouldn’t dare utter a single editorialized peep about it — aside from a log line-length recommendation — even under immediate threat of certain death.</p><p name="77f0" id="77f0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Given my recent voluntary relocation to Portland, Oregon and the word-y pursuits on which I choose to spend all of my money and energy, I should adore everything about Chuck Klosterman and in turn he should be completely invisible across the under-30 demographic, yet I’ve found a special originality in his voice since first exploring it and I think it might be worth requalification. A good friend of mine once dug his <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/04/books/review/Meehan-t.html" data-href="https://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/04/books/review/Meehan-t.html" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener noopener" target="_blank">first novel <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Downtown Owl</em></a> out of a bulk box of bargain books she’d bought as a preteen, long ago and became an enthusiastic fan of his perspective and a harsh, but fond critic of his persona. It was her copy of his second that I read first: <a href="https://www.npr.org/2011/10/04/141015210/visible-man-asks-what-if-no-one-were-watching" data-href="https://www.npr.org/2011/10/04/141015210/visible-man-asks-what-if-no-one-were-watching" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener noopener" target="_blank"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">The Visible Man</em></a> — ultimately a surprisingly-original take on the <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">psychologist of a gifted outcast </em>tale that classically exemplifies the easy-to-digest yet thoughtfully-exploratory reputation of his craft. Thanks to her library card, I was able to follow it up immediately with Chuck’s latest, most topical work — an anthology of past essays written for publications like <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">The Guardian</em>, <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Grantland</em>, and <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">GQ</em> entitled <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">X: A Highly Specific, Defiantly Incomplete History of the Early 21st Century</em>, which proved an impossibly entertaining, even more polished execution of The Quaint Chuck’s Explanations in non-fiction form, beginning at onset with refreshing brevity in its <a href="http://bit.ly/ckintro" data-href="http://bit.ly/ckintro" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener noopener" target="_blank">introduction</a>.</p><p name="372a" id="372a" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“I’m not fully accredited by either side of the professional equation (sportswriters think I’m too pretentious and music writers don’t think I’m pretentious enough,) but I’m able to write about whatever I want, as long as it actually happened.”</p><p name="22fc" id="22fc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Using “pretentious” even when just vaguely and loosely expressing other readers’ thoughts about your work is the first of many miniscule technical infractions against convention laid down in <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">X</em>’s arrangement which proves to act toward the benefit of its experience. If you substitute <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">car nerds</em> for <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">sportswriters</em>, I’d personally identify with this picoautobiography in a big way, but more importantly as a <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">reader</em> I had never encountered anything written about sports which I would describe as <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">pretentious</em>, per se, and that realization could very well have birthed enough curiosity to land the sale, had I been skimming in a bookshop, which I would’ve eventually been pleased with.</p><p name="7dce" id="7dce" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Now, during what we should hope to be the first dawn of a new microera of sincerity, we must recognize how valuable it is for Klosterman as an observer to be comfortably engaged with his subjects, emotionally, and confident in the value of his commentary in middle-age without the need to insist upon his eccentricity, as so many cringey, culturally-daft Dads do, these days. He uses keywords in his writing and spoken publicity that <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">should</em> dismiss him immediately as one of these — a nostalgic, out-of-time dork — but are instead somehow magically manipulated to <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">serve </em>him in articulating reasonable, even profoundly-innovative insight. As I have explored his bibliography and his publicly-expressed thoughts, I have been caught up and hinged on a single supposition: <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Chuck Klosterman is the only white, 46-year-old bearded Portland Dad you should be reading</strong>. Do mind that I am in no way exempt from this lens, but it’s still my job to determine his viability as an intellectual — a “thought-leader,” even — for those of us who were conceived around the same time he was wrapping up his collegiate sentence at the University of North Dakota.</p><p name="d845" id="d845" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">For a solid hunk of the American reading audience, a quick, elemental vector of quality and mastery we look for in an essayist is the ability to “transcend” their subject matter for even the most presumptuous and conceited among us, usually to deliver a more abstract sentiment to leave with. Here, Klosterman’s significant career experience is irrefutably evident — in <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">X</em>, he achieves this transcendence organically to a degree I’ve never before witnessed. We can already check a single box: convincing even a young professional twenty-something to shell out for a physical hardback of contemporary non-fiction requiring any sort of academic effort to consume is going to be nigh-impossible, even though <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">X</em> happens to be the best-looking specimen of print product design I have ever handled across cover, type, and layout. It’s been difficult having to convince myself to give this copy back.</p></div><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--fullWidth"><figure name="bfee" id="bfee" class="graf graf--figure graf--layoutFillWidth graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*h4YHcLhVEoS2UmqtzkjC6A.jpeg" data-width="3024" data-height="4032" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2560/1*h4YHcLhVEoS2UmqtzkjC6A.jpeg"></figure></div><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><figure name="aeea" id="aeea" class="graf graf--figure graf--iframe graf-after--figure"><iframe src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F338230534&amp;show_artwork=true" width="700" height="145" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></figure><p name="2634" id="2634" class="graf graf--p graf--hasDropCapModel graf--hasDropCap graf--hasDropCapImage graf-after--figure"><span class="graf-dropCap"><img class="graf-dropCapImage" data-image-id="1*wkeNgKYGOUGIiDfHcQ8jwA.png" data-width="3762" data-height="3186" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/400/1*wkeNgKYGOUGIiDfHcQ8jwA.png"><span class="graf-dropCapText">In</span></span> the interest of full disclosure, I must take special care to emphasize <a href="http://www.extratone.com/?s=recode%20media" data-href="http://www.extratone.com/?s=recode%20media" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener noopener" target="_blank">just how highly</a> I regard Peter Kafka as editor and interviewer extraordinaire within the Media beat — well-proven to be capable of hitting consistently hard on both <a href="https://www.recode.net/2017/8/10/16115548/patreon-jack-conte-fan-pledges-subscription-paywall-recode-media-peter-kafka-podcast" data-href="https://www.recode.net/2017/8/10/16115548/patreon-jack-conte-fan-pledges-subscription-paywall-recode-media-peter-kafka-podcast" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener noopener" target="_blank">novel</a> and <a href="https://www.recode.net/2018/2/1/16957324/wired-paywall-nick-thompson-magazine-advertising-subscription-peter-kafka-recode-media-podcast" data-href="https://www.recode.net/2018/2/1/16957324/wired-paywall-nick-thompson-magazine-advertising-subscription-peter-kafka-recode-media-podcast" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener noopener" target="_blank">old guard</a> industry personalities with refined, <a href="https://www.recode.net/2018/5/22/17380908/youtube-music-launch-10-lyor-cohen-interview-peter-kafka-recode-media-kanye-west-childish-gambino" data-href="https://www.recode.net/2018/5/22/17380908/youtube-music-launch-10-lyor-cohen-interview-peter-kafka-recode-media-kanye-west-childish-gambino" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener noopener" target="_blank">seemingly unimpeachable</a> stone-faced skepticism. However, this Chuck Klosterman interview for <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Recode Media</em> is an uncharacteristically disarmed display of serious admiration: he introduces <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">X</em> with an outright confession: “It’s great. I bought it. I bought a signed copy,” which is an unexpected oddity (though not an unwelcome one — I’m glad Peter enjoys his life.) Their conversation dips briefly in personal history (Chuck and his wife moved to Portland from Brooklyn for its proximity to family) before plopping down upon the substance of his clearly superb and matter-of-fact interview technique.</p><blockquote name="c7b6" id="c7b6" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p">The only reason I’m able to ask you these questions is because I’m a reporter and I can ask you questions now that I probably wouldn’t feel comfortable asking you if we were friends, so I’m not going to pretend that we are and I’m not going to create some fake thing where we’re going to have a relationship beyond this conversation. I’m just going to ask you the things I want to know about and I hope that you respect the fact that I’m just being straight with you.” I find that that works much better.</blockquote><p name="9877" id="9877" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">From the broadest possible pop cultural lens, Chuck’s most spectacular and widely-circulated work, demographically (I assume) is his <a href="https://www.gq.com/story/taylor-swift-gq-cover-story" data-href="https://www.gq.com/story/taylor-swift-gq-cover-story" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener noopener" target="_blank">2015 interview and cover story</a> for <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">GQ</em> with Taylor Swift, then “the most popular human alive.” Yes, it really <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">is</em> worth dwelling on the image: <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">this guy</em>… this very Dorky Dad, just hanging out with the most highly-demanded teen idol who’s ever lived, sitting awkwardly next to her in the backseat of her car as she excitedly accepts a call from Justin Timberlake. When one Chucks such a distinguished contrast upon such a high-profile contemporary medium, the weight of the potential scrutiny becomes palpable, but Klosterman anticipates and braces for this (very risky) business in the only manner he can: acknowledging it over and over and <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">over</em> again in the second paragraph of his every interview appearance.</p><p name="f6d0" id="f6d0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It doesn’t matter if it was complimentary or insulting necessarily. It would seem as though I wasn’t taking her seriously as a musical artist, and the idea is that I do. That’s why I’m writing about her is because I do think she’s a meaningful, significant artist. It’s not worth the risk of having the story then get shifted by other people who perhaps just perceive themselves as somebody who’s a watchdog for certain signifiers or certain elements of the culture and that their job is to be on the watch for this. If your story then gets moved into that silo, that’s all it’s going to be remembered for… It’s a touchier thing now.

One might reasonably suggest that Klosterman regards the practice of calling out or remarking on “creepy misogyny” as “dumb” — nothing but the byproduct of changing “times.”</p><blockquote name="ae5a" id="ae5a" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p">Something you may notice in the following 2015 feature on Taylor Swift is that I never describe what she looks like or how she was dressed, even though I almost always do that with any celebrity I cover… If I did, it would be reframed as creepy misogyny and proof that I didn’t take the woman seriously as an artist. It would derail everything else about the story.

Right…? It <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">doesn’t</em>? Surely, it must be certified Awake through some combination of keywords or format I’m unfamiliar with or unable to visually register because Klosterman’s ass would have long been grass, otherwise. These 224 words are <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">X</em>’s most contentious, which you could call impressive, all things considered — he appears to care enough about his public image to curate it somewhat diligently.

If we are to place our faith in Chuck as our last bearded champion, we must hope that last sentence is sincerely intended to be his lens to the changing world. Granted — even if it <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">is</em> the truth — it’s not as if persistent acknowledgement of one’s position can miraculously wash away any systematic patriarchal dynamics involved in authoring (or reading, for that matter) a high-profile feature of a young woman on cover of a magazine which explicitly seeks most to speak to “<a href="http://www.condenast.com/brands/gq/" data-href="http://www.condenast.com/brands/gq/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener noopener" target="_blank">all sides of the male equation</a>,” (are you <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">sure about</em> <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">that</em>, Condé Nast?) especially considering how unlikely it would’ve been for me to read anything about Taylor Swift outside of this very white man’s anthology. Fundamental themes of power and control are threaded throughout both his fiction and non-fiction, which is especially prevalent in the Macho Big Boy cultures of the athletics and music industries. In profiling Taylor Swift — the undisputed apex of the latter in 2015 — Klosterman provided a firsthand account of the grueling maintenance of a public and private personality under tremendous strain from said factors as they were magnified to the max by the most extreme celebrity.</p><blockquote name="e940" id="e940" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p">Here we see Swift’s circuitous dilemma: Any attempt to appear less calculating scans as even more calculated.

He told me he had lost three family members within the past year: his mother, who was sixty-six; his uncle, who was fifty-six; and his sister, who was forty-six. He said he’d just turned thirty-six.

In profiling Taylor Swift — the undisputed apex of the latter in 2015 — Klosterman provided a firsthand account of the grueling maintenance of a public and private personality under tremendous strain from said factors as they were magnified to the max by the most extreme celebrity.</p><blockquote name="c838" id="c838" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p">Here we see Swift’s circuitous dilemma: Any attempt to appear less calculating scans as even more calculated.

The story of American media is defined by its cycles of waning and waxing democratization, but many of the more traditional avenues in the business have bet on the “two-way relationship” to keep them relevant.</p><p name="64fd" id="64fd" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">My own favorite chapter of the collection is a <a href="http://grantland.com/features/space-time-dvr-mechanics/" data-href="http://grantland.com/features/space-time-dvr-mechanics/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener noopener" target="_blank">2500-word personal essay</a> constructed for <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Grantland</em> to answer a single incongruity: “<strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Why is watching a prerecorded sporting event less pleasurable than watching the same game live</strong>?” Some form of this question has at least mildly troubled every American since the 1960s, including myself, and Klosterman manages to provide an entertaining and concise analysis of this plight through his own wisdom.
