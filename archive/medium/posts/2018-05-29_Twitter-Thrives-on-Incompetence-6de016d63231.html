While some participants were genuinely interested in the opportunity to engage the host’s authority with relevant and invested questions (which were intermittently fielded,) the vocal majority were aggressive, ignorant, and provocative shouts. From my observation, the most noticeably manic and persistent of these came from user <a href="https://www.facebook.com/shane.langman" data-href="https://www.facebook.com/shane.langman" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener noopener" target="_blank">Shane Langman</a>. “Nasa can telephone the moon in 1969 but can’t get a phone signal in death Valley in 2018,” he noted 16 minutes in. “We cant leave the earth or we’d have left it by now.” And there was Bobby Smith, who felt compelled to express his authority on NASA’s inauthenticity: “[I’ve] been researching since 2012 no real pics of anything all cgi.”</p><figure name="3cb7" id="3cb7" class="graf graf--figure graf--layoutOutsetLeft graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*IbRjdgVeLHZh5cn1jTD4VQ.png" data-width="710" data-height="908" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*IbRjdgVeLHZh5cn1jTD4VQ.png"></figure><p name="8608" id="8608" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">After a few minutes of gawking at the mess, I noticed that the broadcast was being simultaneously <a href="https://www.pscp.tv/NASA/1lDxLapRyjLKm" data-href="https://www.pscp.tv/NASA/1lDxLapRyjLKm" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener noopener" target="_blank">streamed on Periscope</a> (or is it Twitter Video? or Twitter Live?) so I opened both feeds side-by-side to compare their audience’s behavior. The Periscope’s viewers averaged about 1000 strong, and their comments were noticeably more orderly and decipherable. There was still trolling and self-promotion, but it wasn’t allowed to disrupt the rest of the committed discourse, perhaps because of each post’s character limit or rationed screen time. Looking between them, the contrast in the user culture and the function of the two services during the same, simultaneous stream was at discouraging odds with their respective popularity.</p><p name="50fc" id="50fc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Neither are really very good ways to watch live video — Periscope, notably, was never designed for professional studio broadcasts — but the relentless malicious nonsense from the Facebook viewers pushed all attempts at real engagement away so quickly that I could see no point in making them at all. To be blunt: every conceivable corner of Facebook is an unusable cesspool (even in the shadow of NASA earnestness,) and it’s worth considering that something about the design of Twitter properties generally discourages such overwhelmingly stupid noise. That’s not to say that harassment, hate speech, misogyny, and radical racism have not been religiously neglected or mishandled as has been well-reported throughout the network’s history — perhaps even more than any other — but I (a cis white man, mind you,) have seen <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">much</em> more of these on Facebook in the wild than I have on Twitter during my longtime use of the two, despite spending exponentially more attention on the latter.</p><p name="26ba" id="26ba" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In my sparse Facebook browsing, I have witnessed childhood friends, professional acquaintances, and family members both distant and immediate publicly shame, harass, belittle, and spitefully argue with each other for the sake of absolutely zero meaningful resolution, conclusion, or intellectual progression. In my decade of daily Twitter use, I have seen tens of pedophiles and rapists publicly outed, suicides averted, government censorship circumvented, stories broken, artists made, and marginalized voices outspoken. I have also Tweeted things in the past (mostly variations of “I want to die”) that would now get my account temporarily suspended, as per the company’s <a href="https://mashable.com/2017/10/17/twitter-hate-speech-abuse-new-rules-women-boycott/" data-href="https://mashable.com/2017/10/17/twitter-hate-speech-abuse-new-rules-women-boycott/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener noopener" target="_blank">latest attempts</a> to minimize its platform’s toxicity — an encouraging suggestion that Twitter is finally catching up and learning to avoid its <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">cultural</em> blunders, which have been the single greatest exception to its most valuable core identity: its mistakes.</p></div><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--outsetColumn"><figure name="fe3f" id="fe3f" class="graf graf--figure graf--layoutOutsetCenter graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*f5rcIXqPbWMljOwGen2dpQ.png" data-width="2210" data-height="1360" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*f5rcIXqPbWMljOwGen2dpQ.png"></figure></div><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><p name="564d" id="564d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">Two weeks ago, Twitter <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/official/en_us/topics/product/2018/a-new-twitter-experience-on-windows.html" data-href="https://blog.twitter.com/official/en_us/topics/product/2018/a-new-twitter-experience-on-windows.html" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener noopener" target="_blank">proudly released</a> the first redesign of its native Windows 10 app since its debut in 2015 — leading a new generation of upcoming “lightweight” Progressive Web Apps and — true to form — immediately reclaimed the title of clumsiest, least-useful Twitter client available.

This sort of idiocy can be reasonably expected of Twitter, but bewilderingly, the Great Minds of tech journalism seem to be unanimously pleased by this decision, which invites one to suspect that they’ve all switched secretly to the exclusive, illustrious <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/askjack/2017/may/18/windows-smartphone-still-worth-buying" data-href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/askjack/2017/may/18/windows-smartphone-still-worth-buying" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener noopener" target="_blank">HP Elite X3</a> — the only smartphone on sale running Windows 10, because Twitter’s execution of these misaligned goals is mindbogglingly foul to look at and unnecessarily frustrating to use. After doing my best to put up with it for a few days, I found myself unable to conceieve of a single advantage this new application has over literally any alternative.</p><p name="a1bc" id="a1bc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">3 out of the 5 bulleted “highly-requested features” listed in their <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/official/en_us/topics/product/2018/a-new-twitter-experience-on-windows.html" data-href="https://blog.twitter.com/official/en_us/topics/product/2018/a-new-twitter-experience-on-windows.html" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener noopener" target="_blank">announcement</a> are just… catching the app up with the web client as it’s been for years: the 280-character limit, Explore tab, and Bookmarks. “Adding” these web-established operations to an even-more-web-based application surely didn’t present much of a workload, but perhaps <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">removing</em> functionality justified the investment. The F and T keys no longer operate as shortcuts for liking and retweeting, which is such a misguided oversight that I can’t help but wonder if this app was actually intended to be utilized by anyone at all (besides HP Elite users.)</p><p name="2c48" id="2c48" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Am I missing something?

If you’ve been Tweeting as long as I have, you’ll likely remember that the company’s own offerings had occupied the bottom-most position in the hierarchy of preferable available clients throughout time and across all manner of operating systems until it finally nailed its Android and iOS software and usurped longtime third-party staples like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/10/01/tweetbot-4-0-becomes-the-best-alternative-twitter-client-for-iphone-and-now-ipad/" data-href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/10/01/tweetbot-4-0-becomes-the-best-alternative-twitter-client-for-iphone-and-now-ipad/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener noopener" target="_blank">TweetBot</a> and <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2015/01/26/twitterrific-5-ios-update-multi-image-support-videos-gifs/" data-href="https://9to5mac.com/2015/01/26/twitterrific-5-ios-update-multi-image-support-videos-gifs/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener noopener" target="_blank">Twitterific</a> just a few years ago.

Justifiably or not, Twitter has persisted in adding stuff nobody likes as they’ve gradually neutered all the great third-party development.</p><p name="a439" id="a439" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">TweetDeck for Windows was perhaps the most powerful mainstream enduser social application that will ever exist.

In retrospect, it was naive to assume that such potent spam capabilities would continue to be entrusted to the general population without challenge, but the modularity and customizability of TweetDeck prime as a standalone application made it useful as hell and quite the power trip. Now, it exists only as a tamed, up-to-brand-guidelines <a href="https://tweetdeck.twitter.com" data-href="https://tweetdeck.twitter.com" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener noopener" target="_blank">web application</a>, yet remains the definitive way to use Twitter on a PC if one desires an ad-free, single-window experience if only because of its congruence with another, even more forgotten feature of the service: <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">lists</em></strong><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">.</em></p></div><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--fullWidth"><figure name="b81b" id="b81b" class="graf graf--figure graf--layoutFillWidth graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*m4KclQ6et1Sjr_PIt1hq5A.png" data-width="2560" data-height="1360" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2560/1*m4KclQ6et1Sjr_PIt1hq5A.png"></figure></div><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><p name="3833" id="3833" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">This is how I’ve seen desktop Twitter since I lasted looked at my timeline in 2010.
