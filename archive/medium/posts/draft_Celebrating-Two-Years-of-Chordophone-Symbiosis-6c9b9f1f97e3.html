I’ve banned myself from writing about music, given the overwhelming amount of knowledge between the musicians, DJs, and producers of our community, but this — the only lifelong habit of mine — is about something else, entirely. It’s definitively my primary counterweight to Extratone-related activities and stresses, but I think there’s potential insight in exploring the nature of my compulsions. It’s going to be awfully introspective, (and probably vain,) so don’t continue unless you’re intrigued by the bizarre essence of human improvisation, and no more than minimally-miffed by the idea of a skinny white EIC reflecting on the presence of music throughout his childhood while the world burns.</p><p name="6919" id="6919" class="graf graf--p graf--empty graf-after--p"><br></p><p name="bf50" id="bf50" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">When I was three, my father began giving me rudimentary piano lessons for a bit, with colored stickers indicating the theory behind the yellowing ivory of his mid-20th century upright Baldwin (which sounds like an entiretly different sort of contraption than my mid-20th century upright Baldwin.) Even at such an age, I was not keen on third-party pressures on my schedule, or the destination of my effort, so I did not enjoy it. My academic knowledge of psychology is limited, but my first-hand familiarity with the essence of human psychology is quite advanced, thanks to 4 years of full-time presence in convenience stores. That said…</p><p name="5a0a" id="5a0a" class="graf graf--p graf--empty graf-after--p"><br></p><p name="6cdb" id="6cdb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I sincerely believe that I have never met anyone so entirely consumed by unwavering resistance to wisdom, advice, criticism, or consultation as my childhood self. I was actually smart in a way that was notable, then (something like an 8th grade reading level in kindergarten,) and challenged, too. Whether by nature or my own volition, I don’t remember ever enjoying anything that I did not discover or seek myself. It wasn’t the “I’m going to pretend not to like this just because you told me to do it” act. Or — if it was — it was unshakably rooted in my core psyche; I genuinely despised anything I was told to do, without fail. </p><p name="989b" id="989b" class="graf graf--p graf--empty graf-after--p"><br></p><p name="d69b" id="d69b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I’m not descending into an autobiography: this defining truth is the foundation of my entire history of chordoaction.</p><p name="7676" id="7676" class="graf graf--p graf--empty graf-after--p"><br></p><p name="990d" id="990d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I went every week at first (it eventually slowed to bi-weekly, then monthly) to see a teacher in the basement of a small town Baptist church for close to a decade, and I did practice reciting lessonbook literature during that time. Perhaps 10 cumulative hours. 60 minutes of practice a year, if you averaged it all out.</p><p name="e619" id="e619" class="graf graf--p graf--empty graf-after--p"><br></p><p name="ed1a" id="ed1a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">And I did learn to play simplified melodies over that time. A few pages from scholastic lessonbooks, here and there; recitals, duets, and the occasional tolerated holiday ambiance. I remember my theory knowledge — though stunted significantly by my apathy — just beginning to become something usable before I quit entirely at 14. </p><p name="6c2e" id="6c2e" class="graf graf--p graf--empty graf-after--p"><br></p><p name="e2d0" id="e2d0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I was on the verge of reliable sight-reading, actually. (A real-time translation of chart to sound, usually used to indicate little-to-no prior experience with the tune.)</p><p name="7a84" id="7a84" class="graf graf--p graf--empty graf-after--p"><br></p><p name="2790" id="2790" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Nine years later, and I’d have to start counting spaces and lines if you wanted me to identify anything beyond the octaves immediately surrounding Middle-C (the very center of a standard keyboard.) If that doesn’t mean anything to you, don’t worry; it doesn’t to me, either.</p><p name="ea45" id="ea45" class="graf graf--p graf--empty graf-after--p"><br></p><p name="cf5f" id="cf5f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Theory-crafted recitation and the activity I have spent 99.5% of my keytime engaged upon are not related in the slightest for me.</p><p name="a80d" id="a80d" class="graf graf--p graf--empty graf-after--p"><br></p><p name="b5a5" id="b5a5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">That may be an exaggeration…</p><p name="7164" id="7164" class="graf graf--p graf--empty graf-after--p"><br></p><p name="5773" id="5773" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Perhaps I should return to origin again.</p><p name="9e24" id="9e24" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The formal lessons I attended in my youth, along with all related “assignments” occupied such a small portion of my space that they wouldn’t cross my mind for weeks on end.</p><p name="68ef" id="68ef" class="graf graf--p graf--empty graf-after--p"><br></p><p name="68a7" id="68a7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">However, there was definitely a moment — I cannot honestly tell you that I reliably recall the specific circumstances or year it occurred, but the summer after first or second grade is my best guess — when I arrived compulsively at that neglected, disastrously out of tune, caramel-rotted, clickey-keyed Baldie and pushed a key for absolutely nobody.</p><p name="865f" id="865f" class="graf graf--p graf--empty graf-after--p"><br></p><p name="36c4" id="36c4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Whenever family (or the occasional stranger) asks me why I can’t ‘teach’ their child, I am forced to recreate this story from scratch, so I guess it’s productive of me to finally get it down. </p><p name="9c2d" id="9c2d" class="graf graf--p graf--empty graf-after--p"><br></p><p name="f06a" id="f06a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In my very human, very childish mind, I was limited by performance anxiety (and still am by a very specific form of it) to playing for a perceived nought. But when my father would leave me alone in that farmhouse while he worked, a buffer of at least two miles would form at any spot on the clock — I had as guaranteed ‘a solitude as you can find in the Midwest, and those opportunities are the greatest contributors to the relationship I have with the instrument today.</p><p name="8018" id="8018" class="graf graf--p graf--empty graf-after--p"><br></p><p name="54b8" id="54b8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I don’t remember the original moment of discovery, but there are three distinct elementary school-era instances in my mind of blistering my fingers from whole afternoons spent pounding away in my first two octaves. In all three cases, I refrained from stopping even after noticing them, and — in all three cases — blood was the end result.</p><p name="406c" id="406c" class="graf graf--p graf--empty graf-after--p"><br></p><p name="1701" id="1701" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The sound itself was very rudimentary. Duplicated hands on a single-octave spread was all I was capable of. C, E, G, Middle-C, E, G, in the beginning. But to coax my developing brain to pipe a trickle of even the most basal unconscious information to the developing muscles in my tiny fingers so that old instrument could translate it into something I could hear… It’s called improvisation, and — for me, then and now — it is entirely irresistible. It is serene. </p><p name="3c26" id="3c26" class="graf graf--p graf--empty graf-after--p"><br></p><p name="13ec" id="13ec" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">After two decades, it is also necessary. </p><p name="199d" id="199d" class="graf graf--p graf--empty graf-after--p"><br></p><p name="b410" id="b410" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In late-Winter of 2015, I was away from a piano for ~two weeks in Colorado, holed up, reading Die Verwandlung in a skiing lodge while my siblings actually enjoyed themselves. (But I couldn’t possibly do what I should have been doing.) </p><p name="a9e3" id="a9e3" class="graf graf--p graf--empty graf-after--p"><br></p><p name="f01c" id="f01c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Kafka’s mastery is in the visceral itchiness present as the consequences of Gregor’s being are progressively described, and I exposed myself to it while occupying the cheapest, tackiest light-wood chairs of our utterly silent little corner room at 10,000 feet — oxygen-deprived, whisky-drunk, and overdressed. In all likelihood, I was delirious as I’ll ever be. I’d tagged along on the annual trip for the first time just three weeks after the girl I’d been with for five years — with whom I’d grown up with, and had by then planned to spend the rest of my life with — had more or less inexplicably severed all contact with me. I was just beginning upon my Year of Tanqueray, during which I’d spend four figures on gin and accomplish nothing but the postponement of my grief.</p><p name="a2bd" id="a2bd" class="graf graf--p graf--empty graf-after--p graf--trailing"><br></p></div></div></section>
