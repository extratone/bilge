I know how it looks… because I’ve run into many of them and have been just as irritated as you. In fact, I would be so bold as to presume I’ve run into <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">many many </em>more than you have simply because a primary hobby of mine has always been Just Trying to Do Things On The Computer without any academic authority or hands-on training. This is a way of life for my generation and those proceeding it, yes, but I promise you that I have gone far, far deeper than the vast majority of anyone you know. What I’m ultimately trying to do here is to spare you the hundreds — perhaps <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">thousands </em>— of hours I have had to spend mulling through shitty workflows throughout my childhood and adulthood before I stumbled upon Good Practices (i.e. Better Ways to Do Things.)</p><p name="d087" id="d087" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I want you to come away from this list feeling as liberated and powerful as I do now when I’m On My Computer without any condescension or tedium. Unfortunately, there’s probably going to be some of both, so please stick with me and don’t take it personally. I do <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">a lot </em>of online reading, writing, and fiddling. I’ve been compelled to do these things in one form or another since very early childhood, and what follows could be described as a list of my favorite tools to accomplish things. Almost all of them are entirely free to use and the vast majority of them are easily and beautifully functional as well. They are what I suggest for my own mother to use, for what that’s worth, and I would argue sincerely for their extreme importance. <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Don’t waste your life on bad software.</em></p></div><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--outsetColumn"><figure name="b099" id="b099" class="graf graf--figure graf--layoutOutsetCenter graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*bnLSyuk86VvrNQlA2UAyGA.png" data-width="2256" data-height="1504" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*bnLSyuk86VvrNQlA2UAyGA.png"></figure></div><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><h3 name="a910" id="a910" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--figure">You Need a Password Manager</h3><p name="6a67" id="6a67" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">In 2020, password managers are no longer optional for digital life. <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">They are mandatory</strong>. If you only ever heed a single piece of my advice, ever, <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">please</em> make it this one. <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/picks/the-best-password-managers" data-href="https://www.pcmag.com/picks/the-best-password-managers" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Most password managers available</a> are secure, cross-platform, optionally cloud-synced tools that help you generate, store, and organize digital credentials. More likely than not, you’re already using one in your favorite browser. On MacOS and iOS, Safari is linked to a service called Keychain, which is — functionally — a robust password manager. On signup for a given website or service, Safari should prompt you to automatically generate secure, complex passwords to store in Keychain. Generally, it’s pretty smart about knowing when it’s time to retrieve the credentials with Touch-ID, but for when it <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">isn’t</em>, you should know <a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/keychain-access/what-is-keychain-access-kyca1083/mac" data-href="https://support.apple.com/guide/keychain-access/what-is-keychain-access-kyca1083/mac" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">how to manually retrieve passwords from Keychain</a>. If you’re deeply enough embedded into the Mac ecosystem, you can feel free to continue to rely on this process as long as you know how to help yourself when it fails. I’m not going to tell you who to trust, but I do <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">almost</em> actually believe in Apple’s commitment to securing user data, if only because of the way their incentives are aligned (in contrast with those in front of data-funded organizations like Google.)</p><p name="2c2f" id="2c2f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">If you’re using a Windows Home Machine and/or an Android smartphone, I believe it’s more urgent that you find a standalone password management solution immediately. I use a gorgeous app called <a href="https://www.enpass.io/" data-href="https://www.enpass.io/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Enpass</a> to store all of my passwords as well as my bank credentials, credit cards, driver’s license information, and anything else I might need to keep handy, securely. I can use virtually any cloud or file-sharing service to keep my “vaults” synced between all of my devices: Microsoft OneDrive, Google Drive, Dropbox, iCloud, Box, etc, and I also regularly create encrypted local backups just in case. I can even <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">share</em> end-to-end encrypted credentials with another device or Enpass installation. I migrated to Enpass two years ago after using <a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/password-managers/best-password-managers-review-digital-security-privacy-ease-of-use/" data-href="https://www.consumerreports.org/password-managers/best-password-managers-review-digital-security-privacy-ease-of-use/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">1Password</a> for nearly 10. It was intuitive and virtually seamless, as such things in software tend to be these days, and as a result, I haven’t had to memorize a single password since my adolescence. Enpass allows me to create custom login templates for quick differentiation when creating new entries as well as picturized categories and tags.</p><figure name="5e82" id="5e82" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*sE99ZIaZq33udzIQ337Z_Q.png" data-width="1678" data-height="1327" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*sE99ZIaZq33udzIQ337Z_Q.png"></figure><figure name="72e8" id="72e8" class="graf graf--figure graf--iframe graf-after--figure"><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/407790756?app_id=122963" width="700" height="467" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></figure><p name="eb55" id="eb55" class="graf graf--p graf--empty graf-after--figure graf--trailing"><br></p></div></div></section>
