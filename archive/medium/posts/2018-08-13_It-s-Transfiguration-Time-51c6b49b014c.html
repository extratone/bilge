Don’t think we’re crying wolf (or is it “passing go?”) this go-around: <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">/music</strong> is going to become the singular subject of our attention for the foreseeable future.</p><p name="d2da" id="d2da" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">We’re going to take Extratone full circle and make an Electronic Music magazine for the <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">new underground</em> (who are more <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">logged on</em> than they are subterranean.) The online community of friends who’s talents have continued to compel me to figure this thing out have only become more and more extraordinary in their crafts, pushing the whole network further and further upward toward its inevitable penetration of the churning, relentless surface discourse in what has become an awkwardly treacherous Indie Ocean. While a few flagships of the American underground techno magazine like <a href="http://en.traxmag.com/" data-href="http://en.traxmag.com/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Trax</em></a> have managed to remain afloat, they’ve been worn down into complacency by the mellowing of their scene and unavoidably shifting priorities after the years they’ve got on us. It’s been alarmingly apparent since 2012 that music journalism would be totally unequipped to spot the heroes of the genre and DAW busting Twitter gang in the crucial moment.</p><p name="2c96" id="2c96" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">For <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">this</em> moment, suffice it to say, <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">the destiny of our music is at hand</em>, and I’ve happened to acquire just about got all we need to build a big fucking boat.</p><h4 name="ea45" id="ea45" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Here’s what the rest of 2018 is going to look like.</h4><p name="f890" id="f890" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">For the next two months, I’ll be combing through the entire King James’-worth of stories we’ve published since launch and meticulously arranging the best of them in a hefty, visually-unbelievable sort of print anthology, which you’ll soon be able to preorder. This issue will represent the whole of my being’s effort for like… half my 20s (if you’re rounding up,) and I <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">know </em>getting my hands on the first proof is gonna make me cry like a toddler, so you can be damned sure it’s going to be something very special and you’d better feel <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">damned guilty</em> if you pass it up.</p><p name="ac7b" id="ac7b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">However, it’s also not something I intend to do on my own. I will undoubtedly be paying for art, illustration, and help with print design, so do please <a href="mailto:davidblue@extratone.com" data-href="mailto:davidblue@extratone.com" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" target="_blank"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">email me</strong></a> with your favorite pitch for magazine art and/or that secret masterpiece of an InDesign template you’ve been sitting on. (Cover art is way more difficult than I expected. Please help me.) Don’t be afraid to join in the novelty of seeing a message (or dumb anime reference) of your own in print — I plan to pepper the issue with little messages, so stop by <a href="http://bit.ly/holeguest" data-href="http://bit.ly/holeguest" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">our Discord</strong></a> and chat me up.</p><p name="8874" id="8874" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In the meantime, you can help tremendously by forgoing just one soda every four weeks for a hardcore cause to <a href="http://bit.ly/tonesub1" data-href="http://bit.ly/tonesub1" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">subscribe for $1</a> via Patreon. As of today, our new support goal is to raise $30 to pass immediately along for a single freelance album review per month.</p><p name="c086" id="c086" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">By winter, we’ll be set to hose down the server in digital baptism so that we may start anew on the future from the best possible foothold when 2019 rolls around. I’ll be in touch with regular updates and more specific calls for freelance art very soon.</p></div></div></section>
