When a social network does those things, Ello’s manifesto argues, “You’re the product that’s being bought and sold.” Zuckerberg’s take was, as usual, practical: whatever ethical merits it might have, the business model won’t scale. “Our mission is to connect every person in the world. You don’t do that by having a service people pay for.” I suggest that Facebook’s users are paying, just with their attention and their personal information instead of with cash.

Others are stand-ins for organizations, like the National Socialist Movement news page, or a homepage for the League of the South, a white-supremacist organization that wants Southern independence.</blockquote><figure name="45a9" id="45a9" class="graf graf--figure graf--iframe graf-after--blockquote"><iframe src="https://clyp.it/sdhgqnl2/widget" width="700" height="258" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></figure><p name="0deb" id="0deb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">Truthfully, I still don’t know how to proceed. I think it’s going to take a while longer to ponder how to frame the story around VK, and how much to advocate for it, but I <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">do</em> have a pretty great paragraph from my conclusion to leave you with:</p><blockquote name="b4ba" id="b4ba" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p">Ultimately, I am not asking you to care about my feelings toward Facebook, but about your own. In its titanically unprecedented position, Facebook, Inc. cannot be exempt from <em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em">any</em> criticism from its users or otherwise. To date, the company has designed its services virtually irrespective of what users have actually <em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em">asked for</em> — substituting psychoanalysis for human volition — and gotten away with it, unlike any other company in their space. At the financial scale it’s operating at, we should expect <em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em">absolute perfection</em> from its services. Not just perfect from a single perspective, but malleably perfect from all possible perspectives. Instead of blaming themselves for difficulties using Facebook, older and less tech-literate users should blame the product vocally. No, this is not too much to ask from a company who’s clientele includes a third of all humanity.</blockquote><p name="d575" id="d575" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">As always, I would appreciate your thoughts on any of this.
