Even under the most ludicrous scrutiny, the company’s rudder is flawless and its course true. What at first glance you’d swear to be an unsolicited conclusion to an obscure examination could very reasonably be described as <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">cheesy</em>, <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">stubborn</em>, <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">dweebish</em>, <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">pious</em>, or just generally <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">boring</em>, indeed, yet the respective accuracy of each of these adjectives are no more than the byproducts of the very same operational ethics which we’ve suggested, requested, demanded, and begged the rest of the world’s computing capitol to re-adopt, enforce, or at least <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">ponder</em> for a beat. The volume of the masses’ exponentially-increasing attendance of late is only overcome by its hysterical shouting match, so let us pipe down for a while, now so that we may be precise as we dig deeper into the methodology which has finally led to a profitable, drama-free outlying technology organization without the need for a single drop of analogous sweat over its brand upkeep. By arranging the company in its infancy to so precisely and elementally align with the needs of its customers, the original troupe of Bandcamp Bums ensured profound and lasting simplicity in the single overarching priority for those in every single role behind the quiet perpetuation of Bandcamp dot com: <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">selling good</strong> <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">music</strong>.</p><p name="7ba1" id="7ba1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The platform indiscriminately provides both individual artists and labels with a clean, cozy, charming, smartly-designed and technically competent storefront with a wide-open storage allocation, optimal search engine optimization and a widely-trusted point of sale experience in exchange for 15% of any sales that should come in — <a href="https://medium.com/@gloom303/a-year-ago-i-released-an-ep-on-spotify-itunes-and-bandcamp-this-is-what-i-l-earned-872925797930" data-href="https://medium.com/@gloom303/a-year-ago-i-released-an-ep-on-spotify-itunes-and-bandcamp-this-is-what-i-l-earned-872925797930" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" target="_blank">significantly less</a> than other channels; <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">half</em> what Apple Music will take. In examining Bandcamp’s history, its impact on independent music, and its viability as an alternative streaming service, we shall excavate the truth behind the derisive cynicism directed its way by the titans of the tech and music press. Over the course of this super link-laden journey, we’d consider the alarmingly hypocritical possibility that it’s been overlooked by mainstream conversations only because it has so long operated in the precise manner we claim is so hopelessly absent from its neighbors in its deliberate, principled, and innovative journey towards a transparent, progressive vision.</p><figure name="efdb" id="efdb" class="graf graf--figure graf--iframe graf-after--p"><iframe src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F308609407&amp;show_artwork=true" width="700" height="145" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></figure><p name="c43a" id="c43a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">To catch our starting gun, we must first travel to <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Face The Music 2016</em> in Melbourne — as far as one can possibly get from The Valley — alongside Bandcamp’s super-worldly Chief Curator, <a href="https://bandcamp.com/andrewjervis" data-href="https://bandcamp.com/andrewjervis" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Andrew Jervis</a> to observe his interview for a live audience.</p><p name="1eb4" id="1eb4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Bandcamp has always grown extremely organically.

Where I come from, launching a desolate business to little mainstream success with persistence and dignified determination is (or should be) regarded as a telltale sign that one is running a front (according to the television, anyway,) but exploration of this plausibility yielded nothing in Bandcamp’s case, even after I took the risk of incrimination and begged a certain Boston-based future funk producer to accept my ginormous bribe and include <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">any</em> sort of pharmacological substance with his summer beat tape. He wouldn’t even send antihistamines.</p><p name="301d" id="301d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><a href="https://youtu.be/MaUkS-lr-ZM" data-href="https://youtu.be/MaUkS-lr-ZM" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/MaUkS-lr-ZM</a></p><p name="2584" id="2584" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">As uncomfortably as it lands on the soul, no moniker describes Bandcamp more comprehensively than “an online record store.” As far as <a href="https://youtu.be/inzhStQJFQw" data-href="https://youtu.be/inzhStQJFQw" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Ethans</a> go, Bandcamp’s CEO and founders’ public attaché Ethan Diamond is as good as they come: it’s quite telling that he is the only Silicon Valley CEO who’s remained intellectually grounded enough with the rest of us in order to retain any skills in nuanced forms of verbal communication like… humor. The closest the company has ever come to promotion? His awkward, sub-20-minute <a href="https://youtu.be/MaUkS-lr-ZM" data-href="https://youtu.be/MaUkS-lr-ZM" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">presentation</a> at the XOXO Festival 2014 offered an impressively succinct introduction to their greater mission considering the unmistakable agony in his body language.</p><p name="25a5" id="25a5" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“We worked out of the public library for the first four years of the company’s existence,” he admits.

Perhaps it was inevitable that Elon Musk, Sundar Pichai, Mark Zuckerberg, and Jeff Bezos would become immortalized as “those who make things happen,” but our ability to quantify value as consumers tends to scurry rapidly away behind our backs when they’re turned by the constant distraction of these mostly inert figureheads. As their personalities have stolen the story, the people in industry with their hands on real product have all but completely disappeared from the frame, and all of the work remaining at the End User’s eye level was abandoned by aspiration long ago and replaced with the unfulfilling mechanism of A Quick Buck. Though now we are proceeding into a similar frame — only because our subject cares more about their mission than claiming recognition for it and might just be the first such company run by a cast who become sincerely defensive at the suggestion of a cash-out.</p><p name="593c" id="593c" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“Bandcamp’s philosophy has always been very different [from] a lot of the companies we’re surrounded by,” reflects Jervis. “We are not a ‘let’s-raise-money-and-burn-through-it’ type of company.”</p><p name="ea8d" id="ea8d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I know that your mind has been trained by years of engagement with the digital media of a rapidly-globalizing, venture capital-obsessed society to block the passage of this sort of language across your conscious threshold at risk of life-threatening overexposure to the Medium Dialect and its churnalising neoliberal cyberchode scholars of the Personal Brand; I know you’ve read the exact same quote from how many entrepreneurs in how many worthless, masturbatory business magazine profiles, but I swear on my one-of-a-kind Estonian Hilary Duff pullout that Jervis speaks without irony or deception. how many fucking churnicles have abandoned you, but this time, it’s actually sincere.</p><figure name="fd99" id="fd99" class="graf graf--figure graf--iframe graf--layoutOutsetLeft graf-after--p"><iframe src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/v=2/album=3931299777/size=large/linkcol=0084B4/notracklist=true/twittercard=true/" width="350" height="467" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></figure><h3 name="405d" id="405d" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--figure">On The Web</h3><p name="cf16" id="cf16" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Though Bandcamp was technically the first comprehensive library-modeled music streaming service in existence, the topical conversations between both technology and music journalists and industry executives flooding both podcast and news feeds at the moment orbiting the “Cord-Cutting” phenomena as it’s washed over television, cinema, and music are rooted in the same building blocks as the core technology behind the delivery of all of these conversations as well as their subjects, funny enough. As long as my subgeneration has known it, The Web has been a source of sound in some manifestation, but the example with the most perplexing history was also the first. Today, one of five tabs in the main menu of my iPhone’s native music app contains the text “Radio” beneath an “antenna with waves” graphic which opens a service once called <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150608143103/https:/www.apple.com/itunes/itunes-radio/" data-href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150608143103/https:/www.apple.com/itunes/itunes-radio/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">iTunes Radio</a> that was absorbed into — and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/1/15/10777790/itunes-radio-apple-music-january-28" data-href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/1/15/10777790/itunes-radio-apple-music-january-28" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">restricted to subscribers of</a> — Apple Music as of 2016, confusingly. However, both “iTunes Radio” and “Apple Music Radio(?)” — along with any and all audio streaming services (mentioned and not) — are fundamentally nothing more than different UX design interpretations of the “simple” practice of streaming an audio file, which made its debut at the turn of the century in the form of “<a href="http://extratone.com/library/internetradiopatent-jozsefkirally.pdf" data-href="http://extratone.com/library/internetradiopatent-jozsefkirally.pdf" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Internet Radio</a>.” Astonishingly, the protocol — still referred to by at least one person on Earth as “Webcasting,” no doubt — has survived nearly 20 years, and even the youngest of us have likely encountered it in unusual situations.</p><p name="d187" id="d187" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Ironically, the <a href="http://radio.garden/" data-href="http://radio.garden/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">majority</a> of Internet Radio broadcasts remaining on the air are nothing more than live duplicates of the traditional radio wave-bound products from the physical stations your car’s head unit receives. Even the current desktop version of iTunes maintains support for streaming “audio files over the internet,” though a glance at <a href="https://support.apple.com/kb/PH19478?locale=en_US" data-href="https://support.apple.com/kb/PH19478?locale=en_US" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Apple’s dated support page</a> for the process suggests it hasn’t crossed anybody’s mind for at least half of that history. In 1994, the publicly-funded radio network <a href="http://extratone.com/library/voa.pdf" data-href="http://extratone.com/library/voa.pdf" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Voice of America</a> became the “[First <a href="http://www.chriskern.net/history/voaFirstOnTheInternet.html" data-href="http://www.chriskern.net/history/voaFirstOnTheInternet.html" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">radio] on the Internet</a>” when it <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/?hl=en#!original/rec.radio.shortwave/2pQ9KUYmLqo/wqhhXS2k-lAJ" data-href="https://groups.google.com/forum/?hl=en#!original/rec.radio.shortwave/2pQ9KUYmLqo/wqhhXS2k-lAJ" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">began</a> — after <a href="http://extratone.com/media/voagore.mp3" data-href="http://extratone.com/media/voagore.mp3" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">an introduction by Al Gore</a>, no less — “offering digitized audio versions of selected newscasts and other program segments in 15 languages on its public internet server on Monday, Aug. 15,” according to former engineer Chris Kern. However — since we’re already this deep into internet history — a distinction must be established between streaming static files and streaming live audio. The first relies on pre-recorded audio files uploaded to a publicly-accessible server — in Kern’s original case, “via anonymous FTP and the Internet Gopher protocol,” which continues to be the elemental process behind every audio file streamed across the Web (including those on Bandcamp, Apple Music, Spotify, etc.) more or less because it ain’t broke.</p><p name="cf98" id="cf98" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Semantically, “live” digital audio streaming in its aforementioned “purest” form is more or less exclusive to Internet Radio. Obscured aside from the traditional station simulcast, Web-only Internet Radio stations have their own of “<a href="https://www.thestar.com/business/2007/04/09/web_radio_may_stream_north_to_canada.html" data-href="https://www.thestar.com/business/2007/04/09/web_radio_may_stream_north_to_canada.html" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the Internet’s quiet success stories</a>,” filled with quaint experiences and an endless cycle of death proclamations which continue to be disproven, anywise.</p><p name="5eb8" id="5eb8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">On June 27th, 1999, <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">The Seattle Times</em> ran <a href="http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19990627&amp;slug=2968794" data-href="http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19990627&amp;slug=2968794" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">an especially worthwhile introduction to the concept</a> that likely represents the only major newspaper’s mention of SHOUTcast (the first and likely last name in DIY Web DJing) in the history of the printed word within a work of truly phenomenal tech reporting on Mark Mataassa’s part.

The now in-stasis <a href="https://twitter.com/nwireradio" data-href="https://twitter.com/nwireradio" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">NWIRE</a> project was by the most relevantly intriguing and <a href="https://soundcloud.com/themartmusic/nwire-radio-guest-mix-11-feb-2017" data-href="https://soundcloud.com/themartmusic/nwire-radio-guest-mix-11-feb-2017" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">savvily-curated</a> home for a diverse host of electronic musicians I’ve ever come across — it was my second default browser tab for most of 2017, when I’d even listen to the odd-hour broadcasts overseen by just the automated library-perusing bot for hours.

Between every few charts, the brief commentary and station identification has provided our own private mystery: Was that one pre-recorded? This guy was on yesterday, but has since shed his accent? However, these tiny temporary mysteries are Internet Radio’s only remaining value for us, and I suspect the same is true for all but the most <a href="http://extratone.com/library/diffusionofinnovations-everettmrogers.pdf" data-href="http://extratone.com/library/diffusionofinnovations-everettmrogers.pdf" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">laggard laggards</a>. For as long as I’ve been coherent enough to disseminate between much of anything, very few of its visible offerings have offered anything groundbreaking or fresh, perhaps out of negligence (one can very easily arrange leave a machine running SHOUTcast to shuffle through a given library of music and/or podcasts indefinitely,) frustration, or economic necessity.</p><p name="d49f" id="d49f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Crucially, the truly <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">most</em> critical consequences and contributions provided by the pioneers of Internet Radio to our current digital streaming experience were centered within intellectual property legislation and advertising-supported business. Unfortunately, this juncture marks our complete departure from my wheelhouse, but thankfully, a few sacred accounts of one of technology’s foremost confusing clashes with the ill-equipped, technoilliterate monoliths of the American justice system do indeed remain. As early as 2002, the ineffable Doc Searls reported on a document authored by the Library of Congress’ Copyright Royalty Board called “<a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2016/05/02/2016-09707/determination-of-royalty-rates-and-terms-for-ephemeral-recording-and-webcasting-digital-performance" data-href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2016/05/02/2016-09707/determination-of-royalty-rates-and-terms-for-ephemeral-recording-and-webcasting-digital-performance" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Determination of Royalty Rates and Terms for Ephemeral Recording and Webcasting Digital Performance of Sound Recordings</a>” for <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Linux Journal</em> in an encyclopedic breakdown of its implications ironically entitled “<a href="https://www.linuxjournal.com/article/6218" data-href="https://www.linuxjournal.com/article/6218" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Why Are So Many Internet Radio Stations Still on the Air</a>?” I would hope my comprehension is sufficient to declare that <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">this was no Cambridge Analytica</em>: only a few years subsequent the technology’s inception, operators within the Internet Radio business faced serious and immediate fines for their pre-enforcement distribution of copyrighted material stretching <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">four years</em> back — the severity of which the Doc suggested would “surely bankrupt many of the individual broadcasters that have been pioneering this marketplace for the longest time.”</p><p name="f283" id="f283" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Unlike the commercial radio stations we hear on the old-fashioned airwaves, Internet radio stations’ primary market relationship isn’t with advertisers; it’s with listeners. In many cases, the listeners are the primary source of revenue. This business model is similar to that of noncommercial (public) radio, only the market relationship is much more direct and efficient. Internet radio stations don’t need to stop programming to hold marathon whine-fests begging listeners to call phone volunteers and pledge money to qualify for a mug or a t-shirt.

As apprehensive as I am to be caught arguing for minimalism over good design, it’s made perfect sense in the use case of <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">this one platform</em>, which knew <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">exactly</em> what it was from birth, along with what it would <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">always</em> be, apparently, which is such a bizarre reversal of the archetypes and the relentless common narrative we know from The Valley’s legends. Ethan first shows the consumer’s experience — none of which has changed after a whole decade aside from quality-specific track purchases — before delving into the artist-side UI, beginning with the statistics tool, which included playback and search insights to a depth that was (and still is) unheard of from a free service. Then, he demonstrates the publishing process from upload to playback: adding album art, setting a release date, and pricing its purchase. Aside from their removal of the old waveform visualizer (I couldn’t find any record of an announcement of this decision, official or otherwise,) Bandcamp has changed absolutely <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">nothing</em> of what’s shown in Diamond’s tutorial.

As the Web had grown exponentially more capable and accessible as a means of audio file distribution, it had become absolutely saturated with blatantly DRM-circumventing .mp3s and .wavs. For years, the quickest way to follow up on a <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">check it out</em> sort of music recommendation was simply to search Google for its track name followed by “.mp3.” If the first go didn’t yield success, even the most rudimentary application of cryptography — like substituting some variation of “nsilmtic.rar” to find a download for Nas’ <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Illmatic</em>, for instance — was a sure bet for one’s second try, which would often return several copies just laying around Google-indexed WordPress media libraries, though results hosted on Mediafire were a preferable alternative. This was the establishment into which my first adolescent digital music discoveries were borned, and I’m still convinced that 99% of us participants were completely without malice. I’d argue heartily that music’s brief escape from the tireless grip of the record industry as its only medium stumbled into digital form would be clearly shown to have a net gain for the whole of American recording artists if you could measure and plot it, including the past, present, and future use of peer-to-peer sharing.</p><p name="0b38" id="0b38" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">2010 would prove to be The Year of Reckoning for the fraction of DRM-violating traffic on the <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">visible</em> Web, at least. Though it’d be virtually impossible to quantify, is it only reasonable to assume that many siteowners made some real money from the ad impressions that directly resulted from their unauthorized hosting and Mediafire-embedding, but let’s consider how minuscule even the most outrageously liberal overestimate would be, side-by-side with the billions in additional revenue YouTube has raked in from the same music since assuming their place as the de facto platform for quickly summoning just about any work of audio that’s ever taken digital form. It was in February of that year that Blogger (another Google property) <a href="https://blogger.googleblog.com/2010/02/quick-note-about-music-blog-removals.html" data-href="https://blogger.googleblog.com/2010/02/quick-note-about-music-blog-removals.html" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">deleted six music blogs</a> from its platform in response to complaints about allegedly DMCA-violating .mp3s. <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">The Registry</em> <a href="https://www.theregister.co.uk/2010/02/11/google_musicblogocide_2010/" data-href="https://www.theregister.co.uk/2010/02/11/google_musicblogocide_2010/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">insisted</a> the collective finger be pointed at the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, itself.</p><p name="3437" id="3437" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“It would seem the music bloggers aren’t versed in the ways of DMCA claims and counterclaims.

Every desktop-class browser ships with the capability to capture any streamable media on the Web with a handful of keystrokes — it’d take a maximum of 20 minutes to bestow upon even the most casual user the knowledge they’d need to keep every single track, YouTube video, and Twitch stream they’d ever watch, 100% legally without a single third-party service/extension interaction, but the crucial question remains to what end, exactly? It’s easy, but it’s not exactly a fun way to spend an afternoon. The only two rationales that’d justify capturing streamed Web files at scale are 1) the totally bonkers inclination that any given property/ies is likely to disappear from the entire World Wide Web, ever or 2) the increasingly rarefying expectation of prolonged time away from internet access.</p><p name="5469" id="5469" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">As Bandcamp has stood so obdurately still, the mainstream music streaming sphere has expanded titanically around it as if enveloping the Indie platform in a surrealist timelapse within the eye of a ruinous tech industry cyclone, which would explosively expand the market into a ghoulish, filthy monstrosity beyond anything we’d recognize from the rule of the WinAmp Hipster, long ago. <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Today, the coolest and most rabid daily music listeners I know all have Spotify memberships</strong>, joining <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/4/16850742/spotify-subscriber-count-70-million-users" data-href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/4/16850742/spotify-subscriber-count-70-million-users" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">70 million others</a> globally as of January. For most, it’s how they prefer to swaddle their lives in a constant soundtrack — at work, in the car, at school, then at home on the television. For many, it’s how they “explore” new music outside of peer and social recommendations… or, that’s how the narrative was supposed to go, anyway. Those folks I know who actually create music, however, are rarely seen using Spotify — even after they’ve endured untold horrors in order to publish their own music there — because the real story of its track record as a place to “Discover” new artists, genres, or sounds is completely abysmal.

And — as the music industry and its satellites shall always remain for the rest of humanity’s reign — both are overwhelmingly associated with young people. There, the crucial divide should probably ring a bell — it’s been a constant between cultural generations for as long as culture, itself has existed.</p><p name="aefa" id="aefa" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">There are those among us who’s adolescent adoration of music is still completely valid as a very powerful component of hormonal development, yet doomed to quickly sizzle into casual listening or worse by the time our post-secondary Senior year rolls around. And then, there are those on whom the curiosity clings devotedly on: the cool high school punk band-forming types our culture loves to romanticize, who’ll inevitably end up bald and bespeckled with a pre-dawn community radio block. These Musicians, Crate-Diggers, and capital-A Audiophiles have historically overlapped in synonymous functions across a love triangle of dweebish intolerability, though it’s become especially easy as of late to forget that DIY recording is by no means a recent development — its financial and technical barrier-to-entry has simply plummeted thanks to the developmental progression of Digital Audio Workstations and a growing industry of consumer-oriented audio equipment. For succinct insight into this dynamic, let’s refer to the pre-dialogue context in <a href="http://extratone.com/library/grousesoftheholy-gq.pdf" data-href="http://extratone.com/library/grousesoftheholy-gq.pdf" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Chuck Klosterman’s GQ interview</a> with “the second- or the third-best rock guitarist of all time” — <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Zinc Blimp</em> legend Jumbo Page.</p><p name="48c8" id="48c8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The only thing Page really wants to talk about [is] the sound of the music, and how that sound was achieved. He can talk about microphone placement for a very, very long time. Are you interested in having a detailed conversation about how the glue used with magnetic audiotape was altered in the late 1970s, subsequently leading to the disintegration of countless master tapes? If so, locate Jimmy Page. If a different musician obsessed over technological details with this level of exacting specificity, he would likely be classified as a “nerd,” as that has become a strange kind of compliment in the Internet age. People actually want to be seen as nerds. But that designation does not apply here. Jimmy Page does not seem remotely nerdy.</p><p name="d523" id="d523" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Bandcamp’s core architecture was handbuilt from the beginning to handle the “hard part” for creators “so that they didn’t have to be so nerdy,” which it, alone pioneered on the Web, becoming the best metadata management utility for all time, but also committing to a traditional interpretation of music mediums that can feel old fashioned in 2018. Despite having been around for a directly comparable length of time, SoundCloud has maintained its relevance among friends in my network as the more socially-focused platform for keeping up with work from their peers thanks in large part to its exclusive, timestamp-oriented comment function, which allows for ultra-specific shortform feedback between fellow creators and fans. This is how the company has chosen to grow its community, which has lent especially to its strength in the most “nerdy” independent scenes: hip-hop and electronic music. The experience is busy by design and the divide between listener and creator is next to non-existent — by now, the difference is universally irrelevant. External sharing has also become a major strength since the inception of SoundCloud’s Web audio player, which was unlike any other embeddable we’d ever seen at the time. Over the years, it’s become the most universally-supported means of embedding a track or playlist elsewhere, though the space has quite recently began blooming with a few much slimmer Open Web offshoots like Vocaroo, Clyp, and Instaudio.</p><p name="7e69" id="7e69" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">While I can casually throw these names around for you in the same sized font, the gulfs between the properties they denote are completely inexpressible in words.

I’ll spare you the entire Forbes piece it would require to comprehensively demonstrate just how cavernous of a disparity canyon the industry represents. Early projects like Pandora were docile, ad-free, and sincerely curious about the curatorial potential of music streaming services — <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">let’s use this cool new tech to play </em><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">music</em></strong><em class="markup--em markup--p-em"> for </em><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">anybody</em></strong><em class="markup--em markup--p-em"> with a Web browser if only because it’ll be a blast</em> — yet in that sense, they’ve all failed entirely. All except Bandcamp, anyway.</p><p name="da42" id="da42" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“We started as a service to help artists sell their music and merchandise directly to their fans, but then as the site grew — it’s now at about 12 million tracks and 1.5 million albums [as of 2014] — we evolved into also being a destination for music Discovery,” he explains, partially anticipating the foot-to-the-floor transition to streaming which has indeed shook the industry the hell up over the years since. The company’s solution is minimal, elemental, yet uniquely alternative as only theirs could be: an idealized <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">digital interpretation of a music collection</strong>, which had actually launched a year before XOXO as part of “<a href="https://daily.bandcamp.com/2013/01/10/bandcamp-for-fans/" data-href="https://daily.bandcamp.com/2013/01/10/bandcamp-for-fans/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Bandcamp for Fans</a>.” That release notably introduced the ability to “follow” both artist and fan accounts, the now-iconic “supported-by” section on release pages showing customers’ avatars and optional comments, and public wishlists. “I think it’s great to use a streaming service for music Discovery — they can be really really good for that,” Diamond <a href="https://youtu.be/MaUkS-lr-ZM?t=16m11s" data-href="https://youtu.be/MaUkS-lr-ZM?t=16m11s" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">concedes</a>, before reiterating one of the several variations of Bandcamp’s founding premise that composes his core argument: “if you actually care about music, and you care about the people who make it, and you want them to keep making it, the best way to do that is to buy directly from them, or to use services that allow you to directly support them.”</p><p name="a0b1" id="a0b1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Instead of the “firehose”-like experience of a contemporary activity feed, “you’ve got a collection of albums and tracks that people were passionate enough to spend money on.” For my personal use, Ethan lit up a long-dormant incandescent bulb in my skull. My use of Bandcamp had long been to purchase and download music files, only — never to stream it — and there’s been good reason for this. While Bandcamp has formally supported playback on iPhone and iPad in-browser since <a href="https://daily.bandcamp.com/2010/07/14/now-streaming-on-the-ipad-iphone/" data-href="https://daily.bandcamp.com/2010/07/14/now-streaming-on-the-ipad-iphone/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">July 2010</a>, actually using it for any substantial amount of playback has always been a souring endeavor. Considering that it’s persisted <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">to this day</em>, we must concede that it is part of an intentional design rather than just an irritating flaw: <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">multitasking between apps or even browser tabs will prevent continuous playback of an album</strong>, as will locking the device. In order to move from track to track fluidly, one must keep the page with the in-use Bandcamp player front and center. For three years, this was the only way to stream Bandcamp on mobile, but such capability was far from reliably expected by even the earliest adopters, then — 3G data networks were worse than you remember, anyway — and then in 2013, <a href="https://daily.bandcamp.com/2013/10/25/its-over/" data-href="https://daily.bandcamp.com/2013/10/25/its-over/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the Bandcamp app was launched</a> on iOS and Android, providing a sufficient fix in my book at the time. (I’d rather any externally-embedded players I may engage with in an album review or artist profile be limited to a single track, anyway.) However, the app itself remained quite mediocre for years, which was a tangible disappointment given how revolutionary their desktop experience had been when the company launched,but not necessarily a substantial deterrent to the sort of user they were attracting.</p><p name="2cf3" id="2cf3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I made a point to spend <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">a lot</em> of time engaging with Bandcamp’s service as much as possible — naturally, this included a trip back through <a href="http://bandcamp.com/davidblue" data-href="http://bandcamp.com/davidblue" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">my neglected, digitally dusty Collection</a>, which proved a way more emotionally provocative experience than I anticipated. Ethan’s simple truth didn’t really sink in until I realized that this list is made up exclusively of my <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">real favorites</em>, and there’s not a single track that is not inextricably and intoxicatingly tied to a specific era(s) of my life (yes, even that one Blank Banshee album… I was 18, okay?) It’s absurdly powerful — not something I could engage with for any extended time without becoming saturated with nostalgic gut stuff. (Listen for my upcoming special celebratory episode of <a href="http://extratone.com/radio" data-href="http://extratone.com/radio" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Extratone Radio</a> to hear the best music I’ve found through Bandcamp.) It hadn’t occurred to me that I would retain ownership and streaming rights to all music I’ve purchased — including for a $0.00 sum, as I did for at least half of the works you see — even after an artist chose to delete or hide it on their own page. (Though they are not retained in my public collection, of course.)</p><figure name="207b" id="207b" class="graf graf--figure graf--iframe graf-after--p"><iframe src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/v=2/track=3541770920/size=large/linkcol=0084B4/notracklist=true/twittercard=true/" width="350" height="467" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></figure><h3 name="259a" id="259a" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--figure">The Discovery Debacle</h3><p name="257f" id="257f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Pursuing an objective definition of “music Discovery” might appear foolish — an individual’s music taste is perhaps the most broadly angst-steeped realms of overwhelming subjectivity in modern American culture, after all — but its the pungent poignancy of our fundamental human relationship with sound, itself which makes the history of Discovery’s digitization so important (and fascinating.) If I were to ask you what you believe should be the single most important function that must be reliably performed by any “music Discovery” device — whether it be an application, Web service, magazine or even a crate-digging habit — the single factor which would render whole vague concept inert, irrelevant, and/or completely destroyed, how would you answer? How would you interpret the question?</p><p name="13a7" id="13a7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It’s important we do well to take a considerable moment to cultivate a special wariness of the eggshells beneath our feet in this arena. Debatably at least a minim more than one’s taste in film, Americans from Generation X on forward until the end of time (I suspect) will hold “their” music as perhaps the most integral support upon which their identities are built throughout every stage of their lives. The intense sensation of ownership that propels this phenomenon within our culture leaves an especially sensitive passage ahead of us.</p><p name="2ef4" id="2ef4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">As a wide-eyed teenager and infantile audio producer, I explored the idea of anti-music in my own entirely Bandcamp-supported project while I searched — aided tremendously by my expert best friend — for the edgiest, least sensical sounds and scenes on which to publicly attach on my identity in an opposing of “Discovery’s” extremes with fandom: <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">an obsessive, entirely-detached last-ditch skirmish between the cultural reality and my delusional pubescent need to be unique</strong>. This process appears to be a universal requisite in modern youth in one form or another, but it’s important now that I emphasize this confession: I was an especially ostentatious little backpacker fuck, but I’ve continued to find my shame well worth achieving a specific balance for music’s purpose in my life, and I’d anecdotally endorse its potential to relieve cognitive dissonance at great scale. There’s only so much fun to be had blasting breakcore cassettes at deafening, distorted volumes solely to bewilder rural overnight convenience store clerks on their smoke breaks in the wee hours or the bruteforce seizure of the speakers’ Bluetooth connection at a frat party just to play harsh noise or anime-sampling Hardstyle while demonically shrieking — eyes rolled back — and lighting various parts of oneself ablaze before one realizes that 1) it’s they who end up looking like the idiots for aggressively breaching a group’s fun with inappropriate tunes (yes, no matter how interesting, rare, or underrated they may be, Chadley;) 2) by ferally manifesting, you’ve deligitimized yourself, which 3) can seriously damage any future attempts to accomplish <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">the fundamental drive to share the gospel of music’s variety</strong> out of your own rubish frustration with the differences between you.</p><p name="43d5" id="43d5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The real, sweetest truth is that <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">100% of all music has value potential</strong> because of the medium’s broad influence on the human psyche. Pop music is amazing right now; the signature trap sound we devalued with Datpiff jokes made us all look like fools when it unconsciously transcended our “irony” and burrowed its own huge partition in our sincere hearts. After my pitiful attempt to reject and distance myself from my own rural roots by scoffing at country music for years, I’ve made a beautiful peace with the childhood memories and the historic excellence of Shania Twain and The Dixie Chicks in their mastery of both wholesome joy and crippling nostalgia (I’ve even cried to Taylor Swift.) Yes, it’s been entirely reasonable all along to enjoy the straightforwardly slothen pleasure in belching “Sweet Home Alabama” pounding cheap pissbeer on a foul pontoon boat on the Lake of the Ozarks, leaving my penultimate irony to confess that I’ve only found true and serene identity through music after learning how to stop insisting so violently upon the worldly, one-of-a-kind superiority of my “taste.”</p><p name="f2dc" id="f2dc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">That said, it’s still bewildering how content we are to abruptly abandon the substance music had to our teenage selves out of misconstrued justifications for our classic fainéance — actively choosing to subject our public ambiance to thousands of replays of “the best” records in favor of dipping even the most cowardly toe into unfamiliar waters, even when the opportunity cost is inherently halved — only to then have the audacity to evangelize our dilapidated conceptions of “good music” to our children as we demonize the music of their generation, depriving them of a very essential rite of their cognitive development. <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">I can think of little more reductive, repugnant, reckless, or racist crusades as a model figure than indoctrinating your child with an inherent distaste for their own culture</strong>, and nothing more deeply alarming to hear from the mouth of someone born in the 21st century than shit like “Queen was better than any rapper will ever be,” or “real musicianship will die forever with Eric Clapton.” It’s unfair and unnatural: imagine if your high school classmates had consistently turned up their scrunched nose at the living whole of rock &amp; roll, declaring Scott Joplin to be the last musician they could stand.</p><p name="454b" id="454b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Consider if the industry-wide customer experience standard for the musical ambiance in 1970s American eating and drinking establishments was entirely comprised of works by John Phillip Souza, and the most prevalent cultural revolution manifested itself something like the following: In countless popular films set in the time (and the stories told today by your parents of their youths that informs them,) a group of popular high school boys — generally three longtime childhood friends and a single addition from the previous summer with an Army Dad and a moderate bad boy aura that’s made him one of the school’s notoriously attractive students and the somewhat-abusive leader in the pack. After spending some time trying to convince the other three (the crucial moment for his case being the bad kid’s rare moment of sincerity trope) of its guaranteed social, sexual and financial ROI, they seal their agreement to start a band with a four-way saliva slap. Imagine if in the progression of this exhausted old tale, it remained entirely classic (and boring) when it faded to a “THREE MONTHS LATER…” ceiling shot of the four the in full, gleaming, performance-spec get-up of the presidential marching band in their garage, and it was revealed that they’d they practiced “The Star Spangled Banner” every night just to make the girls swoon in the film’s resolution with an encore of “America the Beautiful” at an unsanctioned (and very patriotic!) house party.

Even from the generous assumption that every single one of them is an objective masterwork of composition, the amount of affection the American music listening audience has for the same 500 singles is on par with our rampant gun violence in terms of our unanimous tolerance for ridiculously illogical habits. I’ve been sitting in a cute, moderately trendy coffee shop on the corner of the major avenue of access to my cute, moderately trendy Portland neighborhood for an hour now, and I’ve recognized every single one of the tracks played just a bit too loudly on the stereo.

As I understand it, YouTube has long been the go-to houseparty music player because of its universality, Chromecast support, and (obviously) visual component for accompanying music videos, so its new, ad-free <a href="https://djmag.com/content/youtube-launches-youtube-music-and-youtube-premium-streaming-services" data-href="https://djmag.com/content/youtube-launches-youtube-music-and-youtube-premium-streaming-services" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">YouTube Music service</a> has a lot of potential, in theory, but we’re <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">outside</em> in this scenario and our smartphone is our only playback device.</p><p name="5ae6" id="5ae6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Startlingly, the Web’s given best answer to this situation is still Spotify in all of its culture-diluting gluttony. <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Internet radio</em>? Yikes. You can still find a gem of a stream every once in a while, but they’re usually unreliable and probably abandoned, so the catalog won’t last you more than a few hours before you’ll start to hear repeats. You could search out the internet stream of your favorite radio station — a <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">student</em> radio station, even — but those offering the most entertaining programming are unlikely to have a suitable playlist on a summer afternoon. So — forgetting its overwhelming financial funneling toward its top 10% and everything else for a moment — why not just give up the pretense and use Spotify? Again, for most of my friends, it works just fine to play Cat Stevens, Run DMC, Gorillaz or The Rolling Stones, but I have yet to figure out a combination of keywords to keep it on target within even the most rudimentary parameters. Such ill-restraint becomes especially dire — necessary, really — when I queue up “Cannibal Ox Radio” for the office and R Kelly ends up playing, 20 minutes in. Using personally-targeted artist bans is probably too subjective to ask of such a service in the spotlight, but <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">how about an option to filter out white rappers</strong>? (I hope you didn’t blink because that’s by far my best contribution in tech writing yet.)</p><figure name="f510" id="f510" class="graf graf--figure graf--iframe graf-after--p"><iframe src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/v=2/track=2256266207/size=large/linkcol=0084B4/notracklist=true/twittercard=true/" width="350" height="467" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></figure><p name="15b4" id="15b4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">The truth is, I’d probably end up calling upon Apple Music as I’ve been an on-and-off subscriber since its release, but have yet to meet a single fellow user. The girth of its catalog is <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2018/05/06/apple-music-vs-spotify/" data-href="https://9to5mac.com/2018/05/06/apple-music-vs-spotify/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">reportedly still nearly 25% larger</a>, its UI is significantly more cohesively integrated with iOS (which hasn’t always been a given from Apple with its music software, mind you,) yet it costs me precisely the same $9.99 a month as Spotify Premium would. If I <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">did</em> know somebody else who used it, they’d be able to see <a href="http://bit.ly/dbapple" data-href="http://bit.ly/dbapple" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">my public profile</a> including my playlists and activity, just as my followers on Spotify can, and I can create “Stations” for artists that function similarly to Spotify’s endless adaptive playlists, but — crucially, for myself — after the app’s redesign for iOS 10, the integration of Apple Music music with my own iTunes library is completely seamless. With unlimited data, I’ve selected the option to refrain from storing music locally, which further diminishes the distinction between “my” music and the music I’ve paid for the rights to stream. Fundamentally, the end result is that I pay ten bucks a month for “ownership” of <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">all</em> the music on iTunes proper.</p><p name="a462" id="a462" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">While I might personally play Bandcamp Weekly episodes in such a context and gladly accept whatever results I’d get, I’d only do so acknowledging the subsequently increased risk of some vest-wearing fuck I’ve never met springing out of the bushes to accost me about Weird Allan. However, I am neither cool nor musically literate, which makes me particularly vulnerable to misusing algorithmic Discovery — the practice in which artificial intelligence has become most widely-deployed which continues to prove itself to better deserve the term “automated wallowing,” or “robotized ear rot.”</p><figure name="c44b" id="c44b" class="graf graf--figure graf--iframe graf-after--p"><iframe src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/v=2/track=151662136/size=large/linkcol=0084B4/notracklist=true/twittercard=true/" width="350" height="467" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></figure><p name="39a9" id="39a9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">Ironically, Damon Krukowski’s aforementioned “responsibility” essay on <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Pitchfork</em> openly cites Liz Pelly’s burning-hot and <a href="https://thebaffler.com/salvos/the-problem-with-muzak-pelly" data-href="https://thebaffler.com/salvos/the-problem-with-muzak-pelly" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">100% essential analysis</a> of algorithmically-generated playlists for <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">The Baffler</em> notes the publication’s own substantial relationship with Spotify, including a <a href="https://www.webbyawards.com/winners/pitchfork-spotify-inside-discovery/" data-href="https://www.webbyawards.com/winners/pitchfork-spotify-inside-discovery/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Webby Award-winning</a> advertorial series called <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Inside Discovery</em>, which the two collaborate to produce that’s “meant to boost awareness of the ‘Discover Weekly’ feature.”</p><p name="1d74" id="1d74" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The series shows Pitchfork editors (and favored musicians) gushing about their love of streaming — the immediacy! The deep back catalogs! One editor says it helps him keep track of his listening habits, while another rejoices at not having to dig through crates at record shops anymore. Yet another likens Spotify to walking around a music festival, discovering something new at every turn. What does it mean for “the most trusted voice in music” to celebrate an algorithm as preferable to its own crate digging? What does it mean when the tastemaking humans endorse data-driven machines? What does it mean when the algorithms become cool? Virtually every music publication now relies on Spotify media players to embed songs within online articles, and Websites like Pitchfork and Rolling Stone regularly celebrate their playlists with listicles: “Ten Albums To Stream Now.” “The Five Playlists You Need to Hear This Summer.”</p><p name="3e0e" id="3e0e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">We love bespoke Open Web projects, so exploring <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Inside Discovery</em>’s (surely bespoke) experience induced the same pathetic sort of <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">I wish business just incentived building nice things</em> disappointment which has become my default, bitchy mood, and blaming as a further let down to immediately land on <a href="https://insidediscovery.pitchfork.com/playlist-mitski" data-href="https://insidediscovery.pitchfork.com/playlist-mitski" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Mitski’s playlist</a>, to whom I’d just been <a href="https://pitchfork.com/features/profile/dont-cry-for-mitski/" data-href="https://pitchfork.com/features/profile/dont-cry-for-mitski/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">reintroduced</a> (by <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Pitchfork</em>, admittedly) after happening upon her performance at Pitchfork 2017 (which is organized, admittedly, by <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Pitchfork</em>.)</p><p name="8557" id="8557" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Upon a brief review of these once-petty desires and the new, apocalyptic solutions which we are burning barns full of cash to develop, it would appear that the overwhelmingly defining feature of those which are at all viable remains to be the interference of a human being, and why wouldn’t it be, still, when manual music aggregation remains so desperately cheap? I’d wager heavily that there’s at least a single editor within Apple Music who’s spent serious time embedded in the Berlin techno scene considering how regularly the prime “Techno” playlist is updated with new work of a moderately-industrial bias.</p><p name="77fe" id="77fe" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“The downside to automated music Discovery is that we’re encouraged to develop a taste profile and stick to it,” <a href="https://pigeonsandplanes.com/in-depth/2016/03/music-discovery-algorithms" data-href="https://pigeonsandplanes.com/in-depth/2016/03/music-discovery-algorithms" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">opines somebody on <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Pigeons &amp; Planes</em></a>, complimenting Pelly in their profile of former BBC Radio 1 host, Zane Lowe, and his new job curating an Apple Music playlist?</p><p name="5c9c" id="5c9c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The truth is, the stories that come to us that smell the strongest of philanthropy on the surface are often actually about some dusty, Y2K-lookin’-ass nerd with powerfully tedious grievances and too much time on their hands. The whole world knows the details by now of how Mark Zuckerberg’s horny social ineptitude led to Facebook’s conception, but we must both keep in check the bad habit we share — the whole present-day reading world and I, that is — of dwelling entirely too much on the most “negative,” soul-agitating tales in what we perceive to be the pursuit of necessary ingredients for concocting a better solution. Bandcamp’s story is predominantly comprised of smart decisions, sincere transparency, and savvy ideas which are best examined in contrast, I’m afraid, with all that’s being done <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">wrong</em> everywhere else.</p><blockquote name="8a55" id="8a55" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p graf--trailing">Are my favorite punk bands now Bandcamp bands? Are they suddenly wanting to conform to a kind of Bandcamp aesthetic? I don’t think so. Not yet. But if that does happen, something might be lost — a sense of these bands defining themselves as they want to, which is sort of the Bandcamp promise in the first place. People can use help navigating the riches of Bandcamp. But its estimable editorial project opens an interesting question: When does help turn into tastemaking?</blockquote></div></div></section>
