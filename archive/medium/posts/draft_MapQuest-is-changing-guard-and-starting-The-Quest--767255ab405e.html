Meet the new Owner and acting CEO.</strong><br> by Theodore Pith, MapQuest Staff</p><p name="2b22" id="2b22" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Monday, March 12th, 2018 | 08:30 AM PST</p><p name="40ad" id="40ad" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Hello MapQuesters!</p><p name="614f" id="614f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">On behalf of AOL, myself, Peter Built, our new COO Lily Tharp, and those two good-for-nothing leaders who deserted this company and stole all off its leftover cash over the weekend, I’d like to express my sincere gratitude for your continued reliance on MapQuest to help you get where you’re going. I may only be beginning my second week on this side of the screen, but I’ve been using MapQuest directions my entire adult life! We have quite a bit in common already, then, and I <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">can</em> tell you that it’s <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">only</em> thanks to invested users like yourselves that our jobs are made possible!</p><p name="7242" id="7242" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">As well as our thanks, you also have our undivided attention as MapQuest users, so I’ve launched this blog to 1) provide a better interface between us to make sure our intercommunication with you is as smooth as available resources allow and 2) build a better context on <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">where</em> and <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">when</em> we travel, and why we love the <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">how</em> of getting there! Before continuing, I <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">am</em> now remind you that <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">The Quest</em> is intended for mature readers only and note that you’ll need to 1) create an account with us and surrender your date of birth or 2) pledged thrice that you are over the age of 21 each and every visit before you’ll be allowed past the Stop Page when it goes live next week, after which you can be sure our team will be holding questionnaires, streaming video, and writing about the future of this new property and of MapQuest as a whole.</p><p name="f7e3" id="f7e3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Now, though, I’d just like to conclude this short update by telling you a bit more about myself. I grew up in Cincinnati with my father who races balloons professionally and never failed to encourage me to <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">shoot for the clouds</em> as a tot… except when the ceiling exceeded 14,000 feet, of course. I developed an obsession with civil infrastructure growing up — public transport, public works, urban development, etc. I spent my allowance for a whole year to become a lifetime member of the Ohio State Civic Historical, which was an amazing deal considering the Roundabouts of Ohio calendar I receive, free of charge, every year. Each one contains photographs of the same roundabouts taken from the same angle, corresponding with the same months, but — even after hanging them in my room through 20 editions, now, those roundabouts somehow manage to never disappoint.</p><p name="af89" id="af89" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I was obsessed with trade journals on electronics hardware as a young man to such an extent that I dropped out of college (having done little to nothing academically for 5 semesters anyway, if I’m honest,) and formed the origins of the research company you know know as Ditto in the basement of my friend’s grandparents’ old house. And yes, the rumors are true… I did actually pay taxes for a few years under the registered business name Pither, LLC. We saw some <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">very</em> compelling stuff go through that place, and I will no doubt be proud of what we were able to accomplish in my nearly 10 years there for the rest of my life, but a time eventually came when I needed to let my baby bird out of the nest.</p><p name="5954" id="5954" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The decision to invest in MapQuest was a deeply sentimental one — I knew that no other buyer would be willing or able to take this name where it needs to be, and I am inexpressibly thrilled by the opportunity to take it there, especially with the help of such an ace team! Do subscribe to our feed because you’ll be hearing from them right here, twice a week.</p><p name="8661" id="8661" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">Until next time!<br><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Theodore Pith</strong></p></div></div></section>
