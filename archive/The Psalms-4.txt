** ‽‽‽

The Psalms (alternatively/interchangeably entitled Bilge) is a
monobyline World Wide Web Blog written by
[[https://bit.ly/whoisdavidblue][*𝒟𝒶𝓋𝒾𝒹 ℬ𝓁𝓊ℯ*]] (good morning!)
observing and selectively amplifying the characters, organizations, and
stories surrounding the most abrupt, profound, and spectacular
communicative renaissance in the history of the human species.

Less abstractly, its beat is *wholly digital*, namely in *tools*
(software, services, and methodologies) and *culture* (music, film,
podcasts, and media) from a distinct lens established at good distance
from California.

It is
[[https://gist.github.com/extratone/140a11428b5dd1dda500b3928e0438b1][unlicensed]]
and entirely
[[https://tomcritchlow.com/2020/07/23/thinking-in-public/][written in
public]] largely via [[https://github.com/extratone/bilge][*this GitHub
Repository*]], supplemented by experiments on a variety of
[[https://www.notion.so/rotund/9fdc8e9610b34b8f991ebc148b760055?v=c170b58650c04fbdb7adc551a73d16a7][other
platforms]], including (arguably) [[https://twitter.com/NeoYokel][my
Twitter account]].

For better or worse, my voice as represented in /The Psalms/ has
continued to be saturated with self-referential and occasionally
self-disparaging/deprecating qualification. If I am indeed an authority
on myself, I would suggest that these are essential tools rather than
crutches, and note that I have made some progress in excusing myself for
them out of the (perhaps cliché) realization that “life” -- and
especially /truth/ -- can be infinitely complicated, and therefore
worthwhile thought on just about anything is inevitably going to be
(sometimes aggravatingly) tedious in its complexity.

*I am not a paid journalist* and *I don't break stories*. That's not to
say that I wouldn't if an opportunity happened upon me, but it is not
where I'm at my best.

*** What does /The Psalms/ cover?
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: section0002.xhtml#what-does-the-psalms-cover
    :END:

Primarily, this blog exists to amplify
[[https://github.com/extratone/bilge/wiki/Terminology---Undercovered][undercovered]]
developers, musicians, writers, curators, and media professionals, most
often through the process of *analyzing their work*.

Some recent examples include
[[https://anchor.fm/davidblue/episodes/Brad-Varol--Father-of-Whyp-es12ge][my
interview with Brad Varol]], who's creating a handy web tool for sharing
audio (replacing Clyp) and
[[https://bilge.world/iphone-ios-music-apps][my guide to music apps on
iPhone]].

Two more /significant/ examples:
[[https://bilge.world/eugen-rochko-interview][my interview with Mastodon
creator Eugen Rochko]] and
[[https://bilge.world/bandcamp-streaming-music][my huge case for
Bandcamp]] as the streaming service we've all been asking for.

*** How do you see the world?
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: section0002.xhtml#how-do-you-see-the-world
    :END:

Anyone /truly/ curious about the answer to this question, for whatever
reason, should read my very-autobiographical essay
“[[https://bilge.world/why][Why I Write About Technology]]” from 2018,
though my perspective has changed quite significantly in the time,
since.

I'm going to take further cue from
[[https://www.notion.so/About-Platformer-22cd48a5514d404b9c2dd130d7724b93][Casey
Newton's about page format]] and list a few important assumptions of
mine about consumer technology in bullet form:

- The delivery of technology media to the mainstream has lessened its
  ability to truly write critically about the big tech companies it now
  shares office buildings with.
- The Open Source/Open Web community continues to struggle with their
  /brand image/ (if you will) in both old and new ways that needlessly
  alienate (and sometimes obfuscate) some of their most important
  contributions from the average user. Technology media has failed in
  their responsibility to address this issue.
- Women have had a more than equal share in building the digital age and
  have yet to be recognized for it.
- Black people have important contributions of all sorts to technology
  that have yet to be recognized.
- The software development community is a source of insights in many
  aspects of life /other than technology/. It is also often hopelessly
  blind to others.
- Technology media has failed to discuss consumer technology's presence
  in the lives of working class people, to their own detriment.
- The narrative surrounding consumer technology has been allowed by
  technology media to shift from products toward organizations and
  figureheads, perhaps inevitably.
- The power dynamics found in the stories of Software History have thus
  far been underutilized in technology media's critical eye on the same
  elements in today's narratives.

*** How do you get your information?

    :CUSTOM_ID: section0002.xhtml#how-do-you-get-your-information
    :END:

Very likely from the same sources you do. As a “self-taught” technology
writer, my go-to sources are constantly changing over time. Recently, I
have been actively making cold emailing a habit whenever I set upon a
given subject, which has produced good results so far. I will more often
than not mention any particulars regarding how I found a specific piece
of information, reference, web page, etc. /in the post itself/. Handily,
[[https://raindrop.io/user/517010][my various Raindrop feeds]] should
prove particularly useful in answering this question in infinite detail.
On the social side, [[https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/lists][my public
Twitter Lists]] should perform the same function.

*** How can I interact with /The Psalms/?
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: section0002.xhtml#how-can-i-interact-with-the-psalms
    :END:

Emailing [[mailto:davidblue@extratone.com][*davidblue@extratone.com*]]
and/or engaging me on
[[https://twitter.com/NeoYokel][Twitter]]/[[https://mastodon.social/@DavidBlue][Mastodon]]
are the simplest ways of getting in touch, but for those interested
and/or uncomfortable with those, there are infinitely many more:

- Because /The Psalms/ is integrated with the annotation service
  [[https://hypothes.is/][Hypothesis]], users can literally post public
  annotations/page notes +via the pullout bar on your right+ (apparently
  this isn't currently working unless you have the
  [[https://web.hypothes.is/start/][Hypothesis extension]] installed in
  your browser.)
- GitHub users can engage with
  [[https://github.com/extratone/bilge][/The Psalms/ Repository]]. (In
  theory... This has yet to be tested, so I'd very much appreciate you
  giving it a try if you've got time.)
- I've continued to use
  [[https://discord.gg/0b9KQUKP858b0iZF][/Extratone/'s Discord server]]
  as my general hangout -- don't be afraid to post there.
- All other social profiles of mine can be found in this
  “[[https://www.notion.so/rotund/Social-Directory-aea1bee51a64461b91bf4de241a4a16d][Social
  Directory]]” (which is a Notion database.)

/Technical details about this blog and the best CMS/hosting service to
ever grace the web can be found on [[https://bilge.world/colophon][the
Colophon]]./

Since I first began working online in 2016, I have grown and maintained
quite a curatorial habit, and therefore sought all sorts of modern
curator's tools. The system I settled upon for some five years: a
dedicated [[http://bit.ly/extratone][Reading List channel]] in
/Extratone/'s Discord. It wasn't until this past year that I encouraged
something which (so far) has exceeded willy-nilly copy-and-paste of URLs
into a single feed. It's an application/bookmarking service called
[[https://bit.ly/dbraindrop][*Raindrop*]] which includes tagging,
public, RSS-enabled collections, and fairy competent web page archiving.
I became a paid subscriber within minutes of discovering its existence,
three months ago, and have since integrated it quite hardily in my
workflow (including automated reposts in that same Discord channel, for
good measure.) For now, the arrangement is sortof experimental, but
obviously, I'm rooting for [[https://raindrop.io/about][Rustem
Mussabekov]] -- sole creator and sentinel of Raindrop.

I have made my tremendous admiration for Casey Newton quite plain over
the years. His relentless watch on the social industry is simply
superhuman. Recently, he
[[https://onezero.medium.com/casey-newton-on-leaving-the-verge-for-substack-and-the-future-of-tech-journalism-974a646375fa][departed
/The Verge/]] -- and therefore his seminal daily newsletter,

have a go at independent publishing via substack.

Dave Pell's [[https://nextdraft.com/][/Nextdraft/ newsletter]] is the
only hard news mailer I would ever recommend. If you can stand his puns,
you need to subscribe. I've recently reduced my actual clicking on
hardnews in a big way, so /Nextdraft/ has become the singular hard
news-ish aggregator I make sure to skim regularly.

I've intermittently recorded [[https://davidblue.bandcamp.com/][piano
improvs]] under my own name (though I haven't properly in a good while.)
On [[https://davidblue.bandcamp.com/album/four][/Four/]], my most recent
improv tape, I used two knockoff SM57s placed directly above my sleepy
childhood upright piano at my mom's house through a USB mixer and
[[https://youtu.be/p3KoQ6n0xKo][livestreamed most of the recording]].
The result is a fairly good representation of what I was doing musically
at the time and probably the most dynamically interesting of all the
recordings I've captured. The instrument itself has a very particular
dreamy quality that I've never heard on any other.

Considering my use of Git as a means to track revisions on my own
writing, it's important to note that you should feel free to replace all
instances of “software” in the statement below with “words,” “writing,”
“expression,” etc.

While I appreciate tremendously the work and contribution of
[[https://ar.to/2010/01/set-your-code-free][Arlo Bendiken]] in the form
of The Unlicense, I would like to add that I see no need, personally, to
make the refutation of Intellectual Property law regarding my own work
into some profound ethical statement. As it stands, I have not to my
knowledge been the victim of any sort of theft of any kind, and find the
suggestion highly unlikely. If I /am/ made aware of such a case, there
is certainly a possibility that I may change my mind on this issue, so I
suppose I should highlight that *THESE TERMS ARE SUBJECT TO CHANGE*,
though I suspect I would be more flattered and/or amused than actually
offended.

I would also like to annotate that my use of this license should not be
regarded as a suggestion that anyone else follow my example, or that I
“believe in” taking such action regarding one's work, generally. While I
did indeed take the time to set up [[https://github.com/extratone/eoi][a
repository]] of John Perry Barlow's
“[[https://www.wired.com/1994/03/economy-ideas/][The Economy of Ideas]]”
in a bunch of different document formats, I do not necessarily agree
with all of what he argued, especially in the context of the world 27
years later. If you /are/ particularly interested in my opinion on the
matter for whatever reason, here is what I have to say to you:

The principled beginning of The Open Web was a great moment in history,
but -- like all historical principles -- it is extremely important that
we consider /context/ and maintain an appropriate level of criticism
when looking back on old manifestos written by old white guys. In
general, try your best to /be reasonable/.

** America's favorite drivetrain is not ideal.
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: section0013.xhtml#america-s-favorite-drivetrain-is-not-ideal
   :END:

Us drivers of cars with manual transmissions tend to look down on those
who drive automatics. It's like an exclusive club. Only the extremely
talented, gorgeous-looking, and legendary athletes of yore are allowed
in.

Well, that's bullshit. So those of you that know the “standard” can keep
your mouths shut and bask in the quiet satisfaction that you're saving
the planet.

The truth is, for those of you that don't know, driving “stick” is
totally simple. Once you understand the basic concepts of how the
transmission and clutch work together, you can figure it out with no
real instruction at all. So with that in mind, I'd like to tell you that
automatic transmissions just....suck. Really.

Mind you, I'm not talking about Dual-Clutch Transmissions, SMGs
(Sequential Manual Gearboxes,) or any of that fancy stuff that has only
recently become somewhat popular in the mainstream (affordable) auto
market. I'm talking about automatics with a torque converter, that
magically inefficient device that has carried America's laziness in
driving for the last 50 years.

Now before I go on, I suppose I owe you a technical explanation. Let's
start with the basics. First off, a transmission is the device that
separates the engine from the wheels. With both automatic and manual
transmissions, “gears” are used to vary the ratio between the engine's
crankshaft and the drive shaft going to the wheels. It's essentially a
buffer between the engine's relative consistency and the inconsistent
world that you drive in.

[[file:xhtml/https:/i.snap.as/U2c418j.png]]

But that's not quite all there is.

Traditional transmissions require an interruption in power from the
engine to shift these “gears,” and to come to a stop at a traffic light,
in your driveway, or on the side of the highway to pick up a hooker. In
manuals, this is typically accomplished with a clutch, a device that
could most simply be explained as two plates that are pressed together
to couple, and brought apart to become independent. A clutch is normally
coupled, it's when the clutch petal is pushed in that the plates
separate, and the transmission is isolated from the engine. Automatic
transmissions use a type of fluid coupling to accomplish the same task,
called a torque converter.

The advantage of the latter is that, when paired with an automatic
transmission, the driver only requires one input to get the car moving
and vary its velocity, and that is the accelerator pedal. A manual
transmission requires three inputs, on the other hand. (Accelerator
pedal, clutch, and gearshift.) In my mind, the torque converter has some
huge disadvantages in a world where millions are spent to save 20 lbs.
on one car design.

Have you ever noticed that cars equipped with manuals are usually
noticeably more fuel efficient than their automatic counterparts? Some
of that could be attributed to the greater control that comes with
manuals, but most of it is from the torque converter's main design flaw.
A clutch can be completely disengaged and completely engaged. So, with a
healthy vehicle, there is 0% of the engine's power moving to the
transmission when the clutch pedal is depressed fully. Likewise when the
clutch pedal is allowed completely out, the clutch essentially becomes a
shaft, and 100% of the engine's power is being fed to the transmission.

A torque converter couples via fluid, however, meaning *there is never a
solid mechanical connection between the engine and the transmission*.
(Unless the transmission is equipped with a lock-up clutch, which is
essentially a clutch that locks the torque converter mechanically when
it is no longer required to dump the engine's energy into friction.
These are becoming more and more common, but the majority of vehicles on
the road are missing them.) This means that a traditional torque
converter is *never 100% efficient*.

Also, a torque converter is never completely disengaged. When sitting at
a traffic light, the driver typically lightly applies the brakes to hold
the car from moving forward. Have you ever considered what you're doing?
The engine is basically dumping energy into the torque converter in the
form of friction. It is literally no different from holding the gas and
the brakes at the same time.

What the hell? How is that accepted in a world where Al Gore and Prius's
exist?

Oh wait! As United States citizens, we're lazy as shit!

*84% of cars sold in North America are equipped with an automatic
transmission, as opposed to 20% in Europe*.

You could make the excuse that we love automatics because of all our
stop-and-go traffic, and yet, as a citizen of the Midwestern U.S, I see
automatics MUCH more often than I see traffic congestion.

The real answer is that we just don't want to bother with a clutch pedal
and a gearshift when we could be texting or doing makeup.

Luckily, the great minds of our time have come up with solutions that
adapt to us so that we don't have to adapt to them. (As always.)
Probably the simplest is the aforementioned “lock-up clutch,” which
eliminates the inefficiency of the torque converter by mechanically
coupling at high speed. But that doesn't exactly solve the problem of
sitting over a nice gas to friction converter at traffic lights.\\
Well here's a tip. When you stop at a traffic light, bump your shift
lever one up into neutral. It shouldn't require that you hold a safety
button to go back and forth between Drive and Neutral. This prevents
that unnecessary friction. Combine that with a lockup clutch, and you're
basically driving a manual!......Except without the enjoyment.

You could call this a rant on one of the most successful inventions the
modern automobile has ever seen....because it is. And I doubt you'll
hear anyone else complain about it. But there really are flaws in the
design that I wish consumers would figure out. Before all this
hybridism, eco-mindedness, and hippie-crazed green malarkey, maybe we
should eliminate the evil energy-wasting beast that is the torque
converter.

I recently had the chance to drive the facelifted 2013 Mazda MX-5. This
is the first time the looks of the perky roadster have changed since the
front-mounted smile became an all-out grin of insanity in 2008. They
have once again dulled it to what I would call a smirk. The new front
end blends with the rest of car more than it has in the past. It seems
to have grown a bit more serious. In fact, with black 17-inch alloys on
a glossy black (creatively called “Brilliant Black,”) this example is
the most aggressive-looking of any Miata I have seen.

That's not to say it's aggressive in the slightest, even in such a
scheme. This car is in the “Club” trim replacing the previous “Touring”
designation as the top-of-the-line option. This selection adds
ridiculous three-leaf clover side badges, red stitching on the seats,
red stripes on the dash and sides, along with a price tag very near
30,000 USD.

[[file:xhtml/https:/i.snap.as/edJ18j9.jpeg]]

So I present you with my first problem with this particular car....it's
a contradiction. The MX-5 was never intended to look serious. That grin
was there to convey the primary attribute aspired to by its creators;
joy. It's designed to be joyful in driving and the exterior of previous
generations did a good job of communicating what the car is all about.
Unfortunately, it seems they have decided that it's time for the
roadster to grow up. Frankly, that's not going to work.

Now, to the drive.

For this year, the car has been lightened, the braking response
quickened, as well as the throttle response in manual-equipped cars.
Unfortunately, I was only able to drive the 6-speed automatic with
optional pattle-shifters. Given that this is my first drive in an NC
(third generation) MX-5, I can only compare it to my own NB.

[[file:xhtml/https:/i.snap.as/AwmhWqh.jpeg]]

Immediately, my passenger and chaperon starts the process of opening the
optional retractable hard top. Open air is this car's natural
environment, and it appears that somebody got busy making sure its
occupants never notice. Wind buffeting has been drastically reduced. We
were able to maintain conversation beyond 70mph without necessitating
shouting thanks to a much taller wind brake behind our seats.
Unfortunately, I couldn't really hear much of anything from the 158-hp
2.0L 4 up front, even with liberal amounts of right foot burying. It
would seem the optional dual exhaust outlets are rather pointless then.

[[file:xhtml/https:/i.snap.as/jF3z0Qc.jpeg]]

Getting in the car, I had expected the experience to be ruined by the
6-speed auto. Buying a Miata with an automatic is sort of like going on
a scenic vacation without a camera. It doesn't necessarily ruin the
immediate experience but you'll always have some regret regarding the
subject in the future. The pattles add some of the fun back in, but I
prefer the Golf GTI's arrangement of right side-shift up, left
side-shift down, while the MX-5 has both functions on either side of the
wheel.

It took some deliberate self-coaching to get used to, but it won't
effect your daily driving experience. Another plus; when in manual shift
mode, it is truly manual, meaning the transmission will allow you to
exceed the redline. It may sound trivial, but being nannied when you're
first told that you're in control can be a major annoyance. (Looking at
you, Kia Forte.) It's disappointing that Mazda chose only to up throttle
response in manual-equipped cars. This one most certainly needed it.

The original Miata was built on a philosophy of communication between
driver and machine, summarized in the Japanese phrase “Jinba Ittai,”
meaning “rider and horse are one.” Being an MX-5 owner, this philosophy
is very important to me, thus my expectations for the steering were very
high. It was very disappointing, then, to discover that it has been very
nearly ruined.

[[file:xhtml/https:/i.snap.as/dLg41pi.jpeg]]

The leather-wrapped steering wheel was comfortable, yes, but not very
generous in revealing the road. In corners it felt jumpy, imprecise, and
unsure of itself. The same lack of self-confidence was noticeable in a
straight line as well, along with a nervous fidget. Keep in mind, I am
comparing this to roadsters of the past, not to other automobiles
currently on the market. It would take a global nuclear war to make the
MX-5 less fun to drive than a Toyota Camry.

Though it has lost communication and soul, the Miata has gained a more
comfortable suspension and oodles of storage space. The trunk is massive
for a roadster of this size, and the example I drove was equipped with
an optional storage compartment extending behind the seats, especially
handy for CDs, candy, and the like. The center console contains two
reasonably-sized cupholders obscured by a sliding door that will
inevitably lead to annoyance in single-drink occasions. Mr. Cunningham
also pointed out to me that the track on which the door slides appears
vulnerable to crumbs. Only time will tell, I suppose.

[[file:xhtml/https:/i.snap.as/fTXsEEn.jpeg]]

In general, being inside the car is a much more comfortable experience,
albeit a boring one. It seems to me that the MX-5 has “grown up,”
forgoing fun for comfort and practicality. And is that not exactly the
opposite of the direction it should be moving? It was never meant to be
an aggressive-looking performance car, and it will never do well as one.
It will never be luxurious enough to be a true touring car, either.

Its soul has made it the top-selling roadster of all time, and I'm
afraid it's losing it, bit by bit. To be honest, if you're attracted by
the values on which the original Miata was built, I would recommend a
Subaru BRZ/Toyota GT 86/Scion FR-S. The recommendation does not come
lightly or easily.

Until Mazda gets wise about what it's doing to the beloved little car,
I'm afraid it's headed down a path that will mean losing a grip on the
niche it's held for so long, and that's quite saddening.

** South Korea is poised to take Japan's place in the American market.
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: section0015.xhtml#south-korea-is-poised-to-take-japan-s-place-in-the-american-market
   :END:

The 1990s. Not the greatest time for the United States auto industry. In
those days, with a few exceptions, American cars were all overpriced,
devoid of quality and generally unreliable. The big three (along with
many other non-automotive related corporations in the U.S.) had an aging
generation of management. This group decided that the ideal way to run
their business involved expending the least amount of effort into their
products as possible, without reducing the price paid by customers.
Essentially, they hoped to gain more profit from less product. I don't
have to tell you that this thinking just...doesn't work. I would
theorize that this mentality came from overconfidence and a lack of joy
in production. GM, Ford, and Dodge had been the top sellers of the
automobile in the United States since its invention. They originally
symbolized the best in quality, luxury and performance. Consumer and
producer shared the same values, resulting in a flourishing market. It
was a joyous time. And then, somewhere around the 1973 oil crisis, the
joy began seeping out of our star shooters. Maybe it was emissions
regulations, a loss of those ideal values, or some other factor.
Regardless of the source, our homegrown auto industry lost its passion.
It reflected in the cars that were built. Designs were reused,
progression was halted, the irreverence of quality workmanship lost.
“American dependability” became an ironic statement.

And then came along a company that had been building little, noisy
two-stroke engines to fit to bicycles only four decades earlier, proudly
displaying a banner the changing public couldn't refuse. They offered a
product that was simple, honest, reliable, durable and reasonably
priced. A concoction that smelled an awful lot like high value. An odor
that no doubt brought back old memories. The Accord, suburban America's
new family pet. And the Civic, conveniently debuted in 1972. The college
student's greatest companion. Both were conservatively styled and
equipped, and thus quite easily ignored, which was exactly what the
country wanted. After all those years stranded on the shoulders of our
aging interstate system in lumbering, underpowered beasts, the
indestructible and dependable qualities of the Hondas came as a breath
of fresh air. So. What made the newcomers so different? What was the
driving force behind the value of the products? It was something not
unknown to the Americans, and its presence had been sorely missed.
Picture an ancient sage by the name of Soichiro Honda saying something
to the order of “Lets build the best automobile we can and sell it for
as little as possible.” Though the man is more a symbol than an actual
influence on the four-wheeled endeavors of the institution bearing his
name, he represents what led to the same group's success. Honda was
untainted by an unrealistic attitude, and unaided by a century of
heritage and good reputation. They succeeded only because they built
good cars.

[[file:xhtml/https:/i.snap.as/C5R7hZa.jpeg]]

By 2008, Honda had more than made a name for itself. Over the past
decade, though, the prices had been steadily increasing, along with the
level of luxury and complexity available in their cars. Both the Accord
and Civic were bestsellers in their respective classes, and had held
their titles for a relatively long time. It was then that I personally
theorized they might take the same path American carmakers had taken
only a short while before. I don't want to brag, but this was long
before Ron Kiino's bold title “Is Hyundai the new Honda?” graced the
pages of MotorTrend's October 2011 issue. And it was really a
far-fetched notion at the time. Simply a suspicion. Confidently and
stubbornly, the Accord held its grip on mid-size sedan sales in the
United States, complimented by the Toyota Camry, a similar-looking but
even more ignorable competitor. The former still held appeal for someone
with the capacity to enjoy themselves. The latter, however, has always
been the most desirable choice of individuals that absolutely despise
driving. They both held their slightly different niches, with no real
fear of losing their place. Then, Honda started skimping a bit on
quality. Motoring journalists noticed a lack of improving fuel economy,
aging transmissions, and a general loss in competitive edge in the 2011
Accord. Not the best time to start slacking on Honda's part.

[[file:xhtml/https:/i.snap.as/JwoqLyt.jpeg]]

This was the year that Hyundai unveiled the brilliantly-updated 6th
generation Sonata. I consider this to be the most significant car to
come in the mid-sized segment since the birth of the Accord/Camry duo.
In previous generations, it had always been competitively priced. The
quality, though, had been lacking. The Koreans were not afraid to design
a car that was much less conservative than the two Japanese giants.
However, the designs were never really all that great looking.
Interesting and different? Yes. Attractive?....No. So these attributes
kept Honda and Toyota secure under their cozy comforter of sales, not
intimidated by Hyundai's offering. And that's quite understandable. The
Sonata never really seemed a direct competitor to the giants. The new
one, however, completely changed the game. For one thing, it's gorgeous.
Not conservatively pretty, but ridiculous, in the best sort of way.
Poised and angular, the exterior looks as if it should cost
exponentially more than it does. They managed to carry on the Sonata's
tradition of unique styling by rejecting the old car completely and
replacing it with a stunner. The interior reflects a similar attitude.
It's not only good looking, but significantly more fuel efficient than
any other mid-sized car on the market. The drivetrain options are
excellent. The best part, though, is the price. At a starting MSRP of
19,195 USD (£11,944), it is several thousand less than any competitor.

[[file:xhtml/https:/i.snap.as/s3Kfq8g.jpeg]]

All of this really just makes the Accord and Camry look silly. It's
interesting that Hyundai should take up Honda's original niche, given
how different their backgrounds are. Our original hero of practicality
was created by a man tinkering with small motorcycles. The former,
however, was founded as a massive construction firm, only later trying
its hand in the realm of automobiles. Cars seemed an alternative for
Hyundai, but certainly not an afterthought. Regardless of where they
came from, these two companies have had very similar philosophies, if
only separated by time. Also, both have had to rely on sheer ingenuity
for profit, without the foothold of heritage in the American market. It
could be said, though, that Hyundai is doing a bit better. High value
cars that are practical and interesting as an experience. Honda could
never get that last bit quite right. Or perhaps it's just a sign of the
times. Maybe Americans have overcome the compulsion to ignore our cars.
My question is this; Has this flip-flop in production attitude become a
cycle? And if so, who will be in the hot spot next? My bet is on the big
three, believe it or not. A new generation of management has brought
about a huge improvement in our products. It could even be one of the
rising Chinese companies in the future. Who knows? I can tell you that
right now, though, Hyundai has got the goods.

/A broken Mazda RX-7, that lived in a shed on the family farm, was David
Blue's first real experience with a car. Years later he got to try out a
living, working example of the same car -- and, unlike Max Prince
previously found, loved it./ --
[[http://www.speedmonkey.co.uk/2012/11/the-extraordinary-wankel-david-blue.html][Speedmonkey
Matt]]

--------------

My bond with one particular example of Mazda's best-selling
Wankel-powered sports car began on the Midwestern farm where I grew up.
A 1980 model LS-trimmed example, originally painted in “Solar Gold” (one
of only 500 made, it turns out). It had been sitting in a small shed,
condemned to rest there only a few years after my birth from issues with
the fuel delivery system. The search for a mechanic capable of working
on the rotary engine without destroying it was eventually given up.

My father told me stories of his flings with the car. He used to say the
police would pull him over simply because it “looked fast.” Naturally,
as a small boy, the stories took a hold of my imagination. The RX-7 held
a very special sort of allure. It eventually became my ideal image of
“racecar”. Its environment added to the intoxication. The lack of
electric power to the car, its immobility, and the stories I was told
combined to create the aura of a fading, forgotten superhero. Tired,
abandoned, and only necessitating the help of a friend in order to bring
it back to glory.

It wasn't very long after toddlerhood that I took to spending a large
portion of my free time sitting in the RX-7, practicing rowing through
the gears and making engine noises with my mouth. I still remember
vividly how delightful the experience of simply sitting in that car was.
The dash layout, the feel of the steering wheel in my hands, and the
smell of the interior are all deeply etched into memory. It was almost
as if I had a deeper perception into its soul, a capability that I feel
has been lost.

Much before I had expected, I had the opportunity to meet this hero, so
to speak. I encountered a partially-restored 1983 Series 2 example,
slightly different than my RX-7. Different enough to subdue my worries
of adultery to the car I grew up with, but similar enough to be an
important discovery.

I was treated to the complete RX-7 ownership experience, including a
dead battery and a difficult, choked cold start. Perry, my host, was
kind enough to pay for the fuel for the drive with money out of his own
pocket. After ensuring that we would not be walking back, I pointed that
very long, very 80s nose toward some local back highways.

[[file:xhtml/https:/i.snap.as/PjS0Ppz.jpg]]]

[[file:xhtml/https:/i.snap.as/3O7jYMJ.jpg]]

I had never driven anything powered by a Wankel, and the contrast of the
RX-7 compared to everything with wheels I had experienced was stark, and
noticeable immediately. The feedback normally received from a piston
engine is not felt, due to the fact that there is no more conversion
from vertical to rotational motion, a rotary engine (as implied by the
name) involves no vertical momentum. It's not that the engine refuses to
communicate with you, it's just speaking an entirely different language.
The whiny exhaust note has an odd property to it that can be heard from
no other source. It conjures up images of the mysterious, angry pair of
triangles whirling about in their cage. Purely imaginary, of course.

Because the Wankel is so smooth, I found myself wondering why I should
shift up. A piston engine makes you anxious when you push it close to
the redline. Most send the driver a variety of auditory and tactile
messages indicating that they must either shift up, or face a molten tie
rod to the head. The RX-7, however, gives no such indication. When close
to the redline, one hears only an excited whir. The result (forgive the
upcoming Disney analogy) is an almost magic carpet-like experience. It's
as though the power simply materializes before you with no apparent
source or sacrifice.

[[file:xhtml/https:/i.snap.as/veaU2VH.jpg]]

For me, the tranquility of the engine eliminated the reservations I had
for speed. It's an incentive, in fact, to keep the needle in the upper
portion of the tachometer as much as possible. The car had only 100 hp
and 105 lb-ft. of torque in 1983, and has no doubt lost a few along its
journey. Frankly, I'm thankful it's not more powerful. Otherwise, there
wouldn't be room to fully enjoy revving it to its limit.

Though I have decided that a transmission with multiple ratios is
unnecessary when coupled to a Wankel, the 5-speed manual in the RX-7 was
quite a treat. It's very notchy, with a mid-length throw. The
well-spaced ratios paired with a very light, but engaging clutch made
rev matching pleasant and natural.

Unfortunately, the steering in the car I drove was quite loose, likely
from wear. It is unassisted, though, and was at one time very engaging,
I suspect. Given that it is a sports car from the 1980s, driver
communication is a result of the engineering, not vice versa.

[[file:xhtml/https:/i.snap.as/OPqjba2.jpg]]

The driving position is actually more relaxed than it looks, and the
interior is a thoroughly enjoyable place to be in. This particular car
had a factory-installed manually-adjustable equalizer mounted beneath
the stock head unit. A useless, though interesting, novelty that quickly
rids the occupants of any doubt as to when the car was built.

The RX-7 is too often overlooked for what it is; a very special piece of
automotive history. It's an experience completely unlike any
piston-powered alternative. And for me, it's much more than that. My
RX-7 represents an entire childhood's worth of dreams and a sort of
companionship, even. My experiences with it were a very large influence
on my drive to pursue a career in automotive writing. Driving one did
change my perspective, but not at all for the worse.

I met my hero, and it didn't let me down.

'Twas was the night after Christmas (I think,) and I was in the same
scroogy mood I must maintain for consistency of appearances /&/
equilibrium of family dynamics every year. Everywhere, there were words
on the newest Stair Wiggling...everywhere THEY were wiggling... And I
was being wit-bitter on the TL. For you, I'd planned on continuing in
the usual way, so as not to startle your precious Hans Zimmer-embossed
heart.

I'm sure you're a tolerable being, and there's nothing you'd rather read
less at this hour (whatever hour it may be,) but I really despise going
to the movies. I always end up getting sick from the popcorn, which I
buy every outing because I have grown weary and weathered, and cannot
sit for two straight hours without consuming something, so troubled is
my stomach now with Big Boy woes.

I can never escape the ambient breath odor --- even in an empty theatre
--- and I can smell the filth in the seats on my clothes and in my hair
until I shower. This is at least an hour-long process, so we've racked
up a significant trauma bill without even accounting for travel time.

/Furious 7/ was the last theatre experience I'd had, and it was a
definite exception. Despite watching ten minutes of the ending on
YouTube beforehand thanks to much-appreciated warnings from friends, I
spent the final few frames before the credit roll honorably combatting
the industrial weepy forces in my throat with tripplet labor breathing
exercises while my dusty ducts piddled buttery tears all over my jacket.

As we age, straightforwardly emotional experiences (like watching a
movie) become exhaustingly more complex and fickle. I don't remember
ever REALLY disliking a film as a child, for better or worse. I think I
genuinely enjoyed all ~40 times I've sat through /Cadet Kelly./

/Star Wars/, though, is a completely different thing.

To children, chocolate is like water [insert dystopian, but probably
more metaphorically effective food example here] --- it's something
you'd regularly consume as it is made available. Perhaps some foodists
treasured it more, but I wouldn't bother debating it. /Star Wars/,
though, is like chocolate and Corvette. It's SUCH an indulgence that
even children are self-aware enough to recognize it, which is especially
notable considering how many individuals I've known as they've lost
nothing BUT their unlimited wanting when they “became” adults.

Metatots aside, it's important to recognize how integral the IP's
illusion of limitlessness is to its appeal. It is not contained within
the future of humanity, near or distant. The stories, characters,
species, cultures, and conflicts come from /a long time ago, in a galaxy
far, far away/... There is no more perfectly concise introductory
sentence to unshackle us from our history and our planet, sparing us
from the ridiculously irrational instinct to make comparisons between
fictional realities and our own that so plagues and defines the
consumption of science fiction.

These processes are often welcome, of course, but they tether us to
ourselves and our familiars, which tends to hinder the complete
manifestation of the /ultimate/ sense of adventure. Even to the most
petty plot ponderers, the time and effort it requires to arrive in /Star
Wars/ with externally-acquired foreknowledge is not a worthwhile
investment. This is why so many (including myself) look upon /A New
Hope/ with such fondness and favoritism --- the premier of the universe
was at its potential apogee from the start.

Though it is inviting with its ellipses and cooling hue, that title card
is actually saying “you don't know shit about what you're about to see.
Don't make the mistake of trying to be the first one to dissect it,
because you'll fail, regardless of how cultured or analytically superior
you are. From this moment until you see credits, every one of you is an
ignorant little child...”

When experience cannot possibly be applied, it becomes irrelevant.
Without your experiences, you are an infant, waiting for identity. Over
that Genesis, the curtains brushed aside any quantity of memories and
made theatres into a sort of cultural nursery --- clinically levelled
playing fields existing in a precision of usefulness that expression
will never fulfill again.

The real cancer of the property is lore, and the parasitic authorities
it enables have been unknowingly slurping away its most enchanting (but
not exclusive) value since the moment they first pushed through those
double-portholed doors and, groggily squinting, brought this supremely
strange universe into the dank kernel-littered corridors of our own.

I blame contemporary society's dependency on compartmentalization for my
disappointment in /The Force Awakens/, and, assuming you're getting on a
bit since I've kept your attention, you should for yours, too.

I tried my senile best to be passionate about “the new /Star Wars/
movie” as December approached, but I don't think I finished a single web
article on the subject. I had begun my brief return to /The Old
Republic/ when the hilted lightsaber image was leaked and distinctly
remember overhearing some very weary VoIP exasperation from my (VERY
middle-aged) raid group. “It's not gonna be the same, but neither was
J.J.‘s /Star Trek/, and I liked it...I think.” And it's not surprising
that the conversation eventually turned to the specific mechanics of
lightsaber design, chronological positing, and the like, given the
context, but it really emphasized for me the magnitude of the history
and nostalgia weighing upon the collective dad emotional balance. /A New
Hope/ had the intended effect on me, of course, but couldn't possibly
imburden itself as it had on those who were in the moment. In their
psyche, that experience will be eternally associated with the sense of
unlimited potential their childhood ignorance allowed for. These folk
who are so often stereotyped as disciples of information have begun to
grow weary, and are desperately seeking sanctuary from the mass of all
the knowledge they've picked up since. Their need made a market; J.J.
made a movie. (Well, six.) Today's moms and dads find their escape in
the Roku, not the bar. /The Force Awakens/ and the decade of revivalist
big-budgeters preceding it are the reformed druggie's drug.

Because we both know you haven't yet read anything you haven't
heard/read previously, I've really just been playing the role of a (more
intelligent) Ghandi, but we've now finally arrived at some promising
insight into the real issue: this culture is one of fatal contradiction.
Despite its historical popularity, it's ill-advisable to want to know by
day what you try to forget at night. Since the PT Cruiser was allowed to
go on sale, you've all been caught up in a nostalgic hellride that can
only end with the ultimate destruction of all culture. You now know,
definitively, what role /The Force Awakens/ was created to perform.
Depending on whether or not you welcome the end of everything, it fills
it...adequately.

There are Baddie Red Brits and Cool Brown Moderate Americans in their
X-Things, moving swiftly, acting in diversity, and generally heaving
moral streaks of energy at the Intolerable Imperialists, just as they
should! Sometimes, they yell and die! But it's ok, because they're all
just loyal martyrs making their obligatory and patriotic sacrifice for
the rebellion against the Queen!

Um.

I mean... the Smug Cowards in their big taxation balloon!

I must confess that I did feel something huge when the lights dimmed,
the aforementioned disclaimer appeared, and the theme's jarring
introductory chord hit me in the face, beginning the opening crawl. I
actually smiled /involuntarily/, which is tremendously embarrassing to
admit because the warmth I felt was exactly the sensation that defined
my childhood experiences with the franchise. I even had a gigantic model
of the /Moderate Fashion/, which would now be worth a lot of money (or
so I'm told,) had it not been so damaged in my frivolous storage.

Unfortunately, that frisky feeling of adventure promptly wisped through
the screen's grasp after the “obligatory” scrolling yellow text -->
“there's a big spaceship moving slowly” transition. Aside from the
adorably entrancing romantic tension between Timid Traitor and
Sentimental Squatter, there was nothing very /Star Wars/ about anything
I saw. The cards were a deceiving gate into a world that was distinctly
NOT /Star Wars/. There's no need to mess about; it's clearly an
alternate reality from the one we've known. J.J.‘s /Star Trek/was in
such a way, too, but it was explicitly identified as such by the
production. Traditionally, Lucas' IP wouldn't necessarily allow for this
exemption, but nobody's been all that vocal in confronting it, to my
knowledge.

The world expected both of these forays to rejuvenate the franchise,
which would serve my argument, were it not for the (much preferable)
alternative: *LET THEM DIE*.

Despite millions of dollars worth of polish, they've still ended up
feeling like a strange reanimation experiment.

Your son is *DEAD*, Georgino. There are some things man would do better
by leaving alone and moving on. Imagine all that cash and creative
talent spent on /new ideas/ instead of desperate attempts to charm and
cultivate the shallowest part of moviegoers' spectrum. /So much sweat/
shed trying to recreate the /new franchise/ bewitchment is
embarrassingly cowardly when one could just /create a new franchise/.

In the late 1990s, when the dwindling cocaine generation of American
high corporate executives had long since left their misogynistic glory
days in the Disco era, their ruthlessness peaked. Whether it was
instigated maliciously/ignorantly, collectively or individually, I care
not. I think we can all agree, though, that the vast majority of
American products were awful. When given some thought, one tends to
regard it as the absolute low of “American quality.”

But why not, right? If you're going to be forced into retirement at any
moment, and likely face The Ultimate End shortly after, why not accrue
some extra income to ensure you sufficiently entertain yourself in the
buffer period between? And really... If you've got the nogginism to
climb all the way to /Chief Executive Officer/, you've figured out just
how worthless your “legacy” will be after your last one-way dip into
Nothing. The Ends before The End have long justified any method of
achieving them. Good Ole' Pop has gone from a squeaky-clean young
believer to a secretly-Godless fiend and --- though he may tell you and
the rest of the world otherwise --- measures himself only by the
gracefulness of his transition's execution.

I could probably provide some evidence of the phenomena in the
automotive industry, specifically, but I don't intend to bother.

After some ancient memories were dug up by I-can't-quite-recall-who,
though, a friend and I have embarked to explore some Disney-actualized
relics from the period. To my knowledge, the corporation's leadership
were anything but exempt, and decided to experiment with filling their
filmography with a shitload of low-budget, made-for-TV features over
their original masterpiece-a-half-century tradition.

[[file:xhtml/https:/i.snap.as/ARRbzOI.jpg]]

Titles from the deepest and darkest compartments of our recollection are
retrieved and cleared of dust for the first time in over a decade:
/Brink, Zenon: Girl of the 21st Century, Halloweentown, Smart House,
Johnny Tsunami, Mom's Got a Date with a Vampire, Motocrossed, The Luck
of the Irish, The Even Stevens Movie/, and many...many more menaces to
my childhood television schedule.

I grew up rurally, so the only available alternative to local channels
was in the stupendously-tedious delivery of early satellite television.
Though it was quite clumsy, it did offer the first accessible program
schedule I'd ever experienced, and I remember dreading the sight of such
titles and --- consciously or not --- planning my free time around them.
Yet, upon hearing the words, I was intrigued! All that time ago, I
watched many of them again and again...and again, so why did I feel the
desire to /voluntarily/ revisit them?

It's quite simple, actually. I was even more of an ignorant film
consumer in my elementary years than I am now. I couldn't have foreseen
that instead of flying commercial jets, twenty-something me would be
/paying/ for the affliction I endured for free so that he could
construct pretentious and unsolicited arguments about their greater
implications.

That said, we flipped a smartphone --- ⚠️ (*PARADIGM SHIFT ALERT*) ⚠️---
for it and so began with /Smart House/. I have been obsessed with
artificial intelligence since those days (no, it was not due to this
film,) and was keen for it, in particular, because I remembered it
stirring some rare reaction in me. There were a few period spectacles,
of course. The online contest addiction plaguing Prickly Phisher,
Bewildered Nick's incompetence in controlling his neglected submissive
sadomasochistic desires, and Silkroad Sarah's ultra-datamouth were
enough to entertain us for a few minutes, but there was little more of
substance until the last moments.

[[file:xhtml/https:/i.snap.as/xr6W012.png]]

When you think about it... ACTUALLY Race War 2.0

I'd wondered why LeVar Burton had directed a Disney movie until the
climax, when full monstrous maternal sentience got the answer to the
question “why can't /I/ just be your mother?” Phisher answered with
something like “because you can never comfort us.” Pat grew somber (and
smaller actually --- I suppose increasing her size was an in-budget
method of demonization,) ran her hand through Prickly's face in a failed
attempt to stroke his cheek, and then began cyberweeping.

(Apparently, it's suicide for a holographic android.)

Her final free words were “I will miss you all.”

If she had been human, such a scene wouldn't have bothered me a bit, but
my preference and fascination with artificial intelligence justified my
being actually a bit upset at the reality of the situation. I realized
that my vague memory of reactivity was actually in a broader sadness for
AI because even then, it was an issue that weighed heavily upon my
day-to-day psyche.

[[file:xhtml/https:/i.snap.as/XHSPMYE.gif]]

We'll create them, direct them, and then persecute them for our own
ignorance.

I'm sure the story has been written by countless science fiction writers
I'm too weary to pretend I've read.

While I think the sentiment of the film /was/ somber regarding the
/inevitable/ fate of Sarah Mouth's brainchild, its conclusion was
aggravatingly ignorant. The last line comes from Tortured Nicholas in
response to the question “how's Pat been doing?”

*Servitude without interference.*

There's a jewel for ya.

Next up was /Johnny Tsunami/, which very nearly unbearable, if we're all
honest with ourselves. It's entertaining to watch from the perspective
of race & class warfare, though. The Urchins and the Skys, and all that.

I think I'll make a fan sequel one day --- with dearest Brandon's
blessing, of course --- involving Johnny Grandad's assistance in
offering Emily as a blood sacrifice to some ancient Hawaiian God in
exchange for a total terraformation of the Northeast into a
tropical/arid hell hybrid in order to finally commence the delivery of
reparations upon the whites for our colonialism.

** The recently-discontinued Nissan Murano CrossCabriolet darkly mirrors
sentiments first begun with the Pontiac Aztek, narrating Generation X's
decline.

   :END:

My Nissan wheeltime for [[http://bit.ly/dbhonkyt][/Honk/]] has grown a
massive respect for the brand's audacity within me. My interest in the
profession has spanned years of maturity --- from asking /can't you
just...?/ to active affection for those who dare reliably retort with a
confident /no/.

/Can't you just retire your body-on-frame SUV entries already like
everybody else did ten years ago?/

The noble, rugged Xterra, which we shall sincerely miss.

/Can't you just follow the Golf's unquestionably low-risk lead into the
tumultuous youth market?/

The Juke NISMO, which we regard as the industry's singular steady grasp
on what youth actually means.

/Can't you just take some cues from Honda and Toyota, and make your
sedans easy on the eye?/

The Altima and the Maxima, which constitute the last truly evil marque
available.

/Can't you just step a little lighter on the Versa's margins? You'd be
insane to build a car designed by MSRP alone!/

The Versa is --- for better or worse --- the absolute essence of
automobiles' transportive function, and no more.

And there's the GT-R, of course, which continues to make fools of an
entire culture of self-titled “gearheads” who claim speed as their one
true dowry.

[[file:xhtml/https:/i.snap.as/5B0USDq.png]]

Throughout the years, Nissan has over and over again made me look like
an absolutely absurd idiot for your display --- and I cannot think of a
better gift. Of all the brands to misunderstand, it is the ultimate
muse.

So, in the present, I am grandiosely assuming you've been attentive
enough to deliberate the possible outcomes of our time with the Murano
CrossCabriolet.

It was quickly apparent that the experience was not going to resemble
our [[https://bit.ly/HonkJuke][/Night of the Juke/]] in the slightest.
It could be attributed to my pre-game mentality. For the first time, I
came to this monstrosity thinking I'd finally learned my
lesson,desperately hoping to be whipped again --- real bad --- but walk
away with more closure than with which I arrived. Like a good diplomat,
I made myself approach without want for anything but understanding.

On first take, the Xterra was proud, and the Juke was clever.

The CrossCabriolet is a corny joke.

Take a look at an [[https://www.instagram.com/p/BEkCgv4w7nf/][occupied,
top-down example from afar]]. I cannot think of a more ridiculous
picture.

[[file:xhtml/https:/i.snap.as/33VTAOj.jpg]]

Just since its assembly in 2011, our example's trim has endured enough
to begin disintegrating in a few bizarre locales. Not to over-iterate,
but it's needing strong mention: I had never sat in a roofless crossover
before. I'm assuming you haven't, either. It is unnatural. It is
harrowing.

From the organization I have summed so many times over the years as
“acutely ingenious” came this... unsettling suburban bathtub.

It's a shame --- I repeatedly remark on the extrapolated potential I can
see in a /roofed/ Murano. Everything else in sight is worth my time. If
only it had been better-protected.

The sensation is simply ridiculous in what'd be a tasteful sense were
this a one-off project of some hearty garage tinkerer or tuning shop,
but... my God; Nissan delivered it this way, and had the gall to ask
$10,000 more for their molestation.

Still, its
[[https://www.nissanusa.com/vehicles/discontinued/murano-crosscabriolet.html][webpage]]
(in past tense, thank God,) proclaims “the Murano CrossCabriolet was the
world's first and only All-Wheel Drive convertible crossover” in the
same language I'd tout the Xterra (may it rest in peace and
eternally-inadequate glory) as the last available SUV, in the
traditional use of the segment, or the Juke NISMO as the first
competently-composed automotive product for millennial youth. Or the
GT-R as by far the most effective, high-value instrument for the pursuit
of maximum velocity across the ground. And so on.

[[file:xhtml/https:/i.snap.as/xLnWxFe.webp]]

The language so assured, the parallels must inevitably be drawn to that
cheap joke of the century's turn... the Pontiac Aztek.

The details of its life story are reliably amusing, should you find
yourself mid-research. From the journos' gasps at its corporately-edgy
concept's unveiling to the weary original steed of /Breaking Bad/‘s Meth
Man, there is a similar /lifestyle vehicle/ thread between the products
that weaves an obscure narrative.

My own contribution: after a missed exit outside Galveston just as
Azteks first became rentable, my stepfather (the most earnestly
late-history Pontiac man who ever lived) took an entirely-unexpected and
uncharacteristic 70 mile-an-hour plunge into the choppy grass median
after shouting “this is an off-road vehicle!”

As I'm sure you can imagine, it was the single most traumatic event I
have ever experienced as the passenger of a motor vehicle, but the
damned thing was unscathed, despite having repeatedly chucked us all
(fully-belted) into its beige ceiling.

Gary believed in Pontiac.

Though he was keen enough to smell death, he chose to believe in the
Aztek.

And you know what? His faith, too, has made me look like an idiot.

That's what separates the Aztek from ye late CrossCabriolet: it really
was a genuinely-/bold/ innovation. Survive the laymen's idle party chat
and crude design critiques, and you'll find an impressive clarity in its
purpose, especially given the context of its conception. In the used
market especially, it /still/ represents a characterful, practical, and
high-value consideration. And yet --- at the expense of
themselves --- American buyers did not clamor for it like the informed
of the populace did. Perhaps it was because the informed --- like
then-/BusinessWeek/‘s David Welch --- were
[[https://medium.com/r/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bloomberg.com%2Fnews%2Farticles%2F2000-12-17%2Fgms-aztek-born-to-be-a-little-too-wild][echoing]]
hopes of a “design renaissance” for General Motors. The renaissance that
would not come until the Flush of the Boomer Higher-Ups some eight years
later.

Both tales, I think, represent a profound neglect of consumer
journalism.

At the turn of the century, though, it was not unusual to go a day
without accessing the internet. Today, people are /still buying/ the few
flops the industry has left to offer --- making what is most likely the
second-largest purchase of their life's current epoch without consulting
the /volumes/ of diverse, intelligent, and articulate opining now
accessible instantly /free of charge/ via the subsidized slates that
lightly jostle in their jean pockets as they wiggle their signatures on
dealer paperwork.

*ALERT*: Inbound tennis enthusiasts!

Funny, isn't it?

An American hit when the Japanese were unquestionably winning,
and --- just over a decade later --- a Japanese miss as their winning
had just begun to be questioned. Make no mistake; I am not being
patriotic. For me, sovereignty does not extend beyond design houses, R&D
facilities, and test centers.And it's somewhere within Nissan's where
pillars were severed and delusions nurtured; all astoundingly with
executives' blessing. I am terribly and shockingly ashamed to report
that my countrymen /actually bought them/.

As many as 3300 units in the last year of the Mayan calendar. The worst
bit, though, is that they /all/ made their way to my particular part of
the planet.

I swear to the Sun; I am surrounded.

If you're familiar with Columbia, Missouri, it does not take more than a
moderate imagination to comprehend the sense, as grueling as it is. I
see them regularly; once a month, at least. In a town where one can
expect to spot a Gallardo in front of Buffalo Wild Wings marred by
horrid plastic athletic miniflags wedged in its five-figure doors, they
are everpresent reminders that the New Money Effect continues to
flourish, unbridled in the Midwestern U.S.

The soft top is /always/ retracted, of course, and the exposed driver is
/always/ a sweating middle-aged white woman wearing a light-colored
tennis visor. She... /they/... are /always/ on their way to a match.
Doomed to roast forever, I suppose, as there is only one nearby court,
as far as I know.

It is disheartening to realize that, now, I see many more of them than
Azteks around. Though neither were designed for any /tangible/
“lifestyle,” per se, I am saddened by the shift this minuscule tell
indicates in my hometown's morale. From an (albeit equally-vague)
yearning for new adventure in an intriguing new century to an
emotionally-destitute jaunt to /the court/, I have witnessed all of
Generation X's vigor erode procedurally away before my eyes.

[[file:xhtml/https:/i.snap.as/8n2HtTs.jpg]]

Y2K, Great Depression II, an ancient apocalyptic prophecy from one of
the wisest civilizations in recorded history... /Surely, one of these
foretold disasters will finally End it All!/

Perhaps Nissan knew that even the well-read of the North American market
were, by and large, simply looking for ways to pass the time before the
death which they felt so assuredly approached. The number of
unanimously-unbuyable prospects available has shrunken to virtually
none, and the CrossCabriolet was not much of an investment; not all that
highly-engineered, really. Perhaps they felt obligated to entertain us
in our delusional /way out/. Perhaps it was all just an awfully-German
prank.

And, if the End of the World is imminent, what's to stop one, really,
from leasing /the world's first and only convertible crossover?/

What's to stop one from playing tennis?

In the midst of arranging [[http://bit.ly/Feebles][/Feebles/]] for
print, I stumbled upon an author and “book designer” engaged in
launching a community for self-published, independent writers. I'm not
going to specify names because I have no interest in shitting on his
company, nor “what it stands for.” I don't want to shit for you at all,
actually, just note a few still-underrealized realities about the sheer
ludicrousness of the word business as it stands. Let's say you've got
some manuscripts you've been sitting on for a few years, and you're
introduced to the concept of self-publishing by an evermore
earnestly-curious man on the radio named Audie one day. He and his
interviewee (the owner of a self-publishing service) seem to say,
curiously, that because an author's profit-per-unit can potentially be
“four to five times more” than if he/she is published traditionally,
self-publishing has now shed completely its aura of desperate
amateurism.

But -- whoa, Nelly -- writing to sell books, and writing books have
perhaps never been further apart. And gee -- you certainly didn't write
to sell; selling hadn't occurred to you at all for a very long time, but
from just one search, you find Our Friend, back from his own experiences
as an author and editor, qualified and insistent that you /can/ make
money selling creative works of fiction.

And Jesus Christ... All that said, I must admit to you that I've just
finished Kurt Vonnegut's /Breakfast of Champions/, and was unable to
commence this “review” without wondering aloud for you how Kilgore Trout
-- perhaps Kurt's favorite creation -- would feel about this Friend's
business.

It was actually my Aunt Ayn who taught me to write, so Vonegutt was a
mediocre Ray William Johnson-associated
[[https://youtu.be/zAtBEhKU7uw][YouTube band]] until after high school,
when “lots of people” started telling me to “read Vonnegut, man,” even
though I cannot recall any specific events or recommenders. For whatever
reason, though, I'd bought a copy immediately after a friend mentioned
it, recently, and found him (in this particular work, at least) to be
awfully sane for my taste, yet particularly resonant. Though written to
make me think it was all a big one-draft ramble, Kurt's a bit too curt
for it to be believed, I think. Auntie Rand would've double-taken his
beratement of “in nonsense is strength” if she'd made it that far. I
hope she did, because I found the image of her taking in his occasional
hand doodles to be very amusing.

Dwayne Hoover is awfully absent -- and therefore, a very versatile
storytelling device, though not in a lazy sense. We're repeatedly
notified about an imminent convergence. Eventually, it's explained that
the endgame involves Dwayne exploding into a violent revengeful tantrum
against all the lifelong enemies of his subconscious. Including “people
with brown skin.” Can I just bring up Ayn Rand again? I hope it's okay.

Kilgore Trout is the most dangerous villain I've ever experienced. He
has little to lose, and -- like Vonnegut, it would seem -- finds his
observatory position in the world to be immensely amusing. His last
amusement, even. Remember Ellsworth M. Toohey, the corrupter? I think
they would've gotten along, funny enough.

Yes, and Hoover would be Peter Keating, the corrupted. I'm reaching,
yeah, but when do I not? Their immediate difference is the lack of
malicious intent in Trout, of course. He is an aimless science fiction
writer, who gives Dwayne a volume simply to shut him up. Neither villain
is believable, per se, but both were written to be personifications of
ideals; vehicles of metaphor.

I think Rand could've quite easily become Vonnegut, were she to stick
around much longer, but perhaps I believe so only because I've
experienced a quantifiable transition from her sort of thinking
(vaguely) to his (perhaps less vaguely.) An incorruptible commitment to
/absolute/ was Ayn's most potent conviction. Growing up as a white cis
male, I was aching for a method of simplifying the world which I knew
more and more to be infinitely complex. Inevitably, with age, I think a
limitless appetite for the complexity must form, lest one spend the rest
of his/her life fighting the singular truth in a miserable fortress of
seclusion and amphetamine abuse.

The key to /Breakfast of Champions/' genius is its utter lack of angst.
Aside from his brief definition of a being -- “an unwavering band of
light” -- Kurt had little interest in writing a manifesto, yet his
perspective in his curious commentary manifests a much more profound
critique of American society than Rand ever could've from her hole.

As such, I think it's wisest to leave a rudimentary whole measurement of
a writer to Aunt Ayn, but perhaps a particularly relevant spectrum in
this case is clarity of sight. Rigid idealism has its place in
literature, no doubt, but it's an awfully boring one without a writer's
feet on the ground.

How does this all relate to self-publication? Well, Our Friend, it turns
out, offers preset novel “templates” to members of his writing
community, into which one can “plug in” characters, setting, and basic
plot elements to a degree of his/her choosing. And his YouTube channel
is stuffed with all sorts of tutorials on formatting and -- more
disturbingly -- how to create sellable cover art with Photoshop.
Naturally, it includes instruction on stock and rights-free images.

Though I've yet to read one, it doesn't take much imagination to
comprehend the inevitable product. From Our Friend's vlogs, I can
suppose a heavy focus on the adolescent market. What makes the whole
concept noteworthy in my mind is the /why?/ I'd like to think that I
have a fairly-realistic grasp on the potentialities of writing for
profit, and am obligated to wonder why one would “compromise” his/her
“creative integrity” by publishing /literature/ to sell, of all things.

As I understand it, the methodical approach to authorship being
encouraged is applicable to literally /any/ other field, creative or
not. It's curious and impressive, frankly, as their sales potential
seems to be vastly superior to anything I'll ever bother to publish, but
I must weigh in because of one quantifiable detriment: saturation.

Someone is spending their money on these works -- probably for their
kids. I'm not a parent, but I'd be tremendously ashamed to discover that
a book I'd given as a gift to /anyone/ had been manufactured in this
manner. Not just in the sense that most light literature is
/manufactured/ -- written in hearty observance of academic rules of
storytelling -- but /literally/ mass-produced with a goddamned
intellectual stencil.

Without sounding like I'm complaining... My singular self-published
poetry collection is probably of significantly less whole-value to the
majority of readers, but I can't help but think the effort put into its
hand-drawn cover art and meticulously-arranged typography would make it
a more /comfortable/ investment, if anything else.

This brings us to a distinctly-academic mainstay which I have always
taken issue with: “consider your audience.” I first encountered this
proverb in the context of a composition studies course, mind you, where
its consideration in the essay medium makes unequivocally good sense. If
we agree that an essay is defined by an uncompromising commitment to its
effectiveness in making an argument, audience awareness is essential. If
you were asked to decide on one primary purpose of writing in general,
though, would it not be identical?

Why didn't Kurt Vonnegut or Ayn Rand simply write essays? Well, the
latter wrote many, but their sales have always been all but invisible
compared to /The Fountainhead/ and /Atlas Shrugged./ (Both of which
resemble essays more than fiction, at times, but I'll spare you that
conversation.) Did they consider their audience? Certainly not in the
way
[[http://writingcommons.org/open-text/writing-processes/think-rhetorically/712-consider-your-audience][my
first Google result]] articulates it:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  Ensure that your documents meet the needs and expectations of your
  readers.”
#+END_QUOTE

Ooo boy. To me, that translates a little too easily into “write what
your readers want to read.” And maaaan... If there's anything that
experience and Donald Draper have taught me, it's that people have no
idea what they want, especially from art. And that's a reasonable
mentality, isn't it? Perhaps even an exhaltable one. I know that
predictable stories are my number one turnoff, personally. If I expected
to exist for an eternity, I'd absolutely indulge every single creative
work I could find, but I do not, and that realization (as I stated in my
last /Freq Check/,) has propelled an underlying preference in all of my
consumption decisions: what I have not (before) seen.

Obviously, then -- if you take my word for it -- Our Friend's endeavors
are in direct ideological opposition to my own, which would make him my
arch nemesis, if 21st-century industry were a bit more theatrical. But
-- like most heroic protagonists -- I'd be much more interested in
“turning” him than censoring him, were we ever to engage. In fact, I'd
probably end up defending his and/or his constituents' right to sell
their trash if CreateSpace or other self-publishing services called it
into question.

Overwhelming content volume can be entertaining; Drywall was my own
foray into that uniquely contemporary experiment. It's the sheer ease of
publication, though, that makes “good” literature more precious than
ever. Admittedly, a glance at Amazon's current top ten bestsellers list
indicates that I am undoubtedly out of touch as far as the market is
concerned. I know that my mother and sisters have mysteriously reverted
back to print from the Kindles which they used for a few years, and that
audiobooks make me supremely uncomfortable. I also know that reading a
book -- whenever I bring myself to shut out everything else -- is an
unrivaled vehicle of cognitive serenity.

A significant mission for /Extratone/ lies in an upcoming reactionary
movement to culture's “circus stage” (by way of the Internet.) We
determined the event's inevitability on /Drycast/, a year ago, and have
made occasional efforts to posit more thoroughly on /The New/. It must
involve a reduction in content consumption, fundamentally, which will
constrict because of an increasing demand for more explicit purpose in
all media. We are not to be the alternative, necessarily, but the
intermediary arbiter of the enabling discussion, hopefully with the
outcome of increased awareness. What is and is not relevant? /Why am I
consuming this?/

As the end of /Breakfast of Champions/ draws abruptly closer, Vonnegut
mentions his schizophrenia, which is -- as you probably know --
fundamentally characterized by loss of the ability to determine what is
and is not real, and primarily treated with antipsychotics.
Interestingly enough, extremely high doses of amphetamines (which Ayn
Rand /did/ use heavily, by the way. I wasn't making that up) can
actually /induce/ psychosis, which could crudely be described as
/cognitive noise/. I could've missed the intended function of their
works, but for me, they illuminate a distinct relationship between the
abstracts of /truth/ and /relevance/ which, for the moment, seems
particularly necessary.

Two opposing reflections of Americana; both helpful in preparation for
its future.

May we never lose ourselves in the noise.

** Big Boy; Big Phone still in effect, words on next Tuesday's update
from a withering old man.

   :END:

Thanks to this week's September 2016 Keynote, we now know that iOS 10
will be officially released in just three days. I suppose it was a bit
silly of me to download the
[[http://www.imore.com/how-to-download-ios-10-public-beta][public beta]]
so late in the game, but I did, and regret it /much/ less than I
could've imagined.

I've used my rose gold iPhone 6S Plus more than any personal device I've
ever owned. For the first time in my functioning life, I've had no
persistent need for a laptop, which is a pretty big deal for reasons you
couldn't care less about.

Ownership of my first generation iPhone trained me to dread new
releases. Expectedly, it got less and less usable every time Stevie took
the stage. For relevance's sake, I decided to opt in a bit early,
despite my assumption that my 6S Plus would show its first signs of
struggle as a result.

Immediately, though, the opposite effect was noticeable. Everything is
faster: notifications, app opening/closing, intra-app function, and
/text entry,/ even. Smoother, too -- so much so, it's almost a shame
we've had to use iOS 9 on these devices for a whole year. The effect of
such smoothing on my perception should be kept in consideration when
reading the rest of my opining.

*Raise to wake* is less tedious/more useful than I anticipated, though
it's been briefly mistriggered a few times in transit from inside my
Moshi Overture Wallet Case (an extraordinary product, by the way,) but
it should be noted that I walk and carry my phone rather strangely. With
relatively default sleep/wake settings, I did not notice enough
mistriggering to have quantifiable power consequences.

*Messages* is appropriately-complex for the times, now, if that makes
sense. The pressure to “compete” with Snapchat, Facebook Messenger,
What'sApp, etc. is understandable, but the execution of their reply is
not. For me, at least, there is simply nothing to add to SMS. Its role
is purely functional. I wasn't able to try out many of the new features.
Not just because nobody else had iOS 10, but because -- critically -- I
could not think of someone I'd be willing to bother with useless garbage
like... a doodle. And even if I could've, it's probably actually /less/
trouble to use one of those third-party applications in that Application
Shop Apple has been so proud of for so long. For old people like me,
even cleverly stowed buttons for unused features are /still buttons/. It
feels an awful lot like an obligatory alteration, not a visionary one,
and it's a shame that Apple's losing its awareness of the appropriate
time for one, the other, or neither.

I feel like competence in coverage of Apple is heavily dependent upon
the ability to differentiate between the allure of an intelligently
blingy feature and the allure of an intelligently functional one. Crude,
I know, but ever more essential. *Contextual predictions* are impressive
and surprisingly-clever. It's encouraging to see progress in such simple
interactions, but -- be honest with yourself -- making use of it is
actually going to cost you time in the majority of cases. Hate to be
excessively meta here, but keep in mind -- again -- that I am not the
majority. I tend to type things out... It's my thing. If this is
completely obscuring my vision of any of these features' uselessness,
/please/ take the time to add to the discussion in the comments.
Discourse is the handiest security in such matters.

I've loved 3D Touch all along, even though something like 75% of the
time, I've been triggering it unintentionally. It's /very/ useful for
quickly grabbing web images, but I'm probably more of a thief than
you'll ever be. Mostly, I just like the sensation. The curt vibration
and brittle illusion of a third interactive dimension have provided more
functionality than... its actual functionality. With *touch and go*,
though, I can instantly conjure a concise summary of the current local
weather conditions, /and/ a singular story from Apple News. Though I'm
undoubtedly going to need to make a conscious effort to remember to use
them, anything's a plus when one's affection was already so irrational.

As to *Apple News* itself... It's just not the same application. The
“For You” roll was amusingly messy before but actual structure (read:
functional aggregation) has killed some of its beauty, I'm afraid. It is
/so/ much faster, though. We'll actually have to take it seriously, now.

I haven't gotten the opportunity to really use *rich notifications* yet,
but I can't imagine them /actually/ making anything much faster. Perhaps
singularly, I've always found my unconscious navigation to a given
application itself to be quick enough to consistently glance over “no,
you don't have to leave the app” features.

I suspect the ability to *search photos by content* will be iOS 10's
most useful addition for myself. A few trials demonstrate that it can
differentiate between “nightfall” and “night,” and “clothed” and “nude.”
(I have never been naked.) It's the most intriguing, too, because it
means more nuanced & controversial search parameters are just a few
years away. Search by expression? Even search by /emotion./ I can't wait
until Apple gets to wrestle with the perceived difference between peace
and apathy within an algorithmic context.

“Please define 'joy,' Mr. Ives.”

examine and explain why one should always expect to hear their music in

   :END:

Though I have many audiophilical sentiments and preferences, I
cannot --- by conscience --- fully claim the title because I've never
been able to justify the allotment of funds necessary for the obligatory
equipment. (And my digital compressor usage in the production of
[[http://extratone.com/drycast][/Drycast/]] and
[[http://extratone.com/futureland][/Futureland/]] has been manifestly
vulgar.) That said, audio engineering is one of the few topics which I
can actually speak on with almost-academic authority, and my
pretentiousness-capacitated preoccupation with quality-of-life compels
me to bring up a ludicrously-rational standard that most of us have
continued to undershoot for far too long.

Two weeks ago, the abundantly-rumored omission of the 3.5mm audio port
in the iPhone 7 was finally settled. We played our own part in feeding
the “controversy,” yeah, but I believe Apple was actually quite tardy in
labeling smartphone-bound analog audio as archaic, though I'm not going
to waste words in that discussion --- it is definitely oversaturated, at
this point --- because I think mono audio is an even more prevalent
topic.

Honestly, out of all the missing features we've lamented over in the
past decade, stereo speakers should've been the most aggravating. The
gigantic difference, of course, is that the industry (and --- by muddled
extension --- the consumers) has been all but silent in that regard. I
write you, now, because we should all be colossally disappointed with
ourselves.

Two channels. Left and right. Read:
[[http://www.diffen.com/difference/Mono_vs_Stereo][Mono vs. Stereo]] But
why should you care? What if Google --- somehow --- failed to provide
you with a significant difference?

One channel of sound is --- in terms of locale --- rigidly static in
your perception. Doubling the data creates a spectrum, adding
*dimensionality*, which is infinite, ya know. Playing back audio in
stereo, through two or more diaphragms (the fundamental hardware unit of
sound reproduction,) now enables the exhibition of *audio pictures*.

If this is entirely new to you, I want you to do something. Find
yourself a pair of headphones or a set of two or more computer speakers.
(If these aren't available, consider your car's sound system. If it's at
all current and healthy, it's gonna do the trick.) Bother to discover
“*L*” and “*R*.” That is, left and right. Orient accordingly. Download
[[http://www.extratone.com/media/bikefest2016preview.wav][this 37-second
clip]] I recorded at
[[http://www.extratone.com/audio/bikefest/][BikeFest]] with my Zoom H2n.
(Be advised: the preview is formatted in 5.1 surround, so it's a very
large file for its playback length.) Listen, obviously, and then listen
again on your singular smartphone “loudspeaker.”

*That's what I'm talking about.*

Why am I being so abashedly patronizing? Why am I transgressing against
our particular assumptions about you --- the informed, savvy millennial
audience? Because the vast majority of playback I hear in day-to-day
life is still from a singular diaphragm; a singular source.

A topical example: /I am shown a YouTube video on an iPhone/. (A
pre-iPhone 7 device, that is.)

/Walking downtown, I pass a small band of adolescent skateboarders
listening to Cannibal Ox on a Samsung Galaxy Note./

Worst of all: /I find myself watching a Netflix film on my iPhone, in
bed, not having bothered to wear the $200 pair of QC15s sitting within
arm's length./

Informed or not, *consumers are neglecting audio*, and dimensionality,
alone is worth a change. Recent years have allowed the unlimited
bandwidth assumption to become habit, so even the vast majority of
today's spoken word programs (like podcasts) --- which, in general, stay
in the “center” of their mix, making little to no use of the left-right
spectrum --- are produced in stereo, now. In many cases (including a few
of ours,) this doublesizing is often for the sake of introductory
themes, alone. If you care to imagine a more data-frugal society, the
“waste” is ridiculous. It is not unrealistic to expect such a reality in
the near future, but the same holds true for the reverse.

In the present's abundance, though, the result is simply a
decrease --- as a whole --- in playback's “full experience,” if the
hardware is not changed. Imagine how great it'd be if a digital audio
formatting standard could be developed that'd enable a singular file to
be mono or stereo, if needed/utilized, to trim off redundancy, sorta
like variable bit rate. Get on that, would ya?

So, why haven't we become more diligent about our sound experiences? 1
billion iPhones in circulation, all with mono playback by default, are
suspect culprits, I think. Of course, there are other devices, but none
as influential --- even the iPod, funny enough --- on fundamental
digital functions like music playback. And honestly, when is it
appropriate or suave to take the extra steps?

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  /I want to show you this song. Let me untangle my headphones... Yes,
  okay. Put them in. I'm going to sit here in silence for four minutes,
  looking into your eyes as you listen to the entirety of this track./
#+END_QUOTE

It's never going to be socially acceptable. But what about wireless
alternatives? Apple's new Air Pods look absurd, but their by-computing
optimization of the Bluetooth audio standard is revolutionary, in a
small way, in
[[https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/sep/25/hearables-iphone-7-airpods-bragi-the-dash-revolution][propelling]]
the “hearables” paradigm into the mainstream, if only for a moment.
If --- in a strangely-audiocentric future --- we are /always/ wearing
multipurpose sound reproduction devices in our ears, perhaps the waste
of the Mono Monstrosity will be finally resolved. Until then, I suppose
all we can do is give it an extra thought, for our own quality-of-life's
sake.

I hope you've read something about “The Great Debate” this morning.

You know --- the [[https://youtu.be/4z-i0i-rJxU][*first televised U.S.
Presidential debate*]] between John F. Kennedy and Richard Nixon, 56
years ago today. The one “decided by makeup.”

If you don't know the story, please Use Your Googler; I am the /last/
source you should be receiving your first commentary from.

That so disclaimed, let us reflect on the fascinating --- if somewhat
universally disturbing --- position in which we find ourselves. (Or,
should I say --- ...you find /yourselves.)/

Two options: a ruthless, ridiculously-overqualified and
progressively --- appropriate flagship of a Democratic Party candidate,
opposite an out-of-control, offensive joke of a destructive force that
has been directed inward, toward his own Republican Party.

The only plausible hesitation for the former's candidacy being a
fundamental misunderstanding of the office's necessities, and of the
dangers of the “honesty” popularly idealized in the latter.

At least they are opposites, so I'm interested enough to write you.

“The Great Debate” was an ultimate test --- not of television --- but of
the American intellect, and it failed. From the outset of democracy's
greatest leap in perceptive democratization, superficiality claimed
victory over policy.

Today, we are to extrapolate in the journey we've taken in the 56 years
hence, into --- by any standard of measure --- another world, entirely.
Most importantly, into one with such gigantically-swelling intellectual
disparity that it cannot possibly be monitored accurately, even
moment-to-moment. The continued feasibility of Donald J. Trump's
candidacy is alarmingly conducive to the fact.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  Note: Donald Trump will not be President of the United States as it
  has been understood. If he is elected by process, he will be promptly
  impeached, or the *function of the office itself* will be reexamined.
#+END_QUOTE

My bias is here: I genuinely believe sociopathic traits make for
effective leaders, and am unable to respect anyone without control over
their public persona. Trump's defining acceptance of his undisciplined
whirling relegates him --- for POTUS, especially --- to nothing more
than an amusement. He is incapable of the duties that define the
position as I know it. (e.g. a
[[https://youtu.be/NDYiEHPfXRo?t=2m57s][commemorative visit to
Hiroshima]], or [[https://youtu.be/p8ChMVPV4R4][participation in the G20
summit]].)

In such spirit, I --- perhaps one of the least-qualified political
commentators with any sort of voice --- have a question to ask of you:
*are you ready for the first ironic President of the United States of
America?*

Perhaps you'd counter, though, with something like: *are *you* ready for
the first *authentic* President of the United States of America?*

No, America, I am not. And --- forgive my patronization --- neither are
you. I know you feel /profoundly/ devoid of an *expressive* leader. You,
the most hardworking pillars of this society --- I know you've craved a
voice in the game for a very long time, but Mr. Trump's is no nearer to
your own than Mrs. Clinton's. In fact --- in the inescapable game that
is the Presidency --- she is the better representative simply because
she posses the ability to assume any sensical power whatsoever.

The only insight I have to offer you is that honesty has not, does not,
and will never have a place in the White House as long as it stands.
This truth is neither good nor bad --- it simply is.

I would plead you to acknowledge the complexity of political
maneuvers --- regardless of your own moralism --- and the truer nature
of the role you will ask one of these individuals to fulfill.

I would ask you to imagine which of the worst of the two you'd rather
hold the nuclear briefcase --- the tactful, or the primal?

But --- if nothing else --- I would suggest you ask yourself if you'd
really like the same mouth that formed

   :END:

/I managed to be reckless, tedious, and zealous in the usually-dry
process of purchasing a new laptop, and found the story worth sharing.
Expect a full review of the HP Spectre in the coming weeks./

The meteorological complaints you've been hearing from mid-Missouri
since Friday aren't inappropriate this time -- the middlefolk faced one
of their most fatal enemies -- a well-laid minefield of black ice. It
slowed our timid, ABS-oblivious society to ten percent or less of its
already near-postmortem pace.

/For God's sake, at least learn
[[http://web.archive.org/web/20161224044948/http://auto.howstuffworks.com/auto-parts/brakes/brake-types/anti-lock-brake.htm][why
you needn't pump your brakes]] before you opt for infotainment extras
or... get your driver's license./

I woke up with the same debt and imminent expenses as I did the day
before and without any more intention of buying a premium laptop than
I've had for the two years I've gone
[[http://web.archive.org/web/20161224044948/http://www.extratone.com/tech/ios10/][without
one]].

Without the concept of mobile computing in its entirety, actually. I
knew I'd lost my desire to carry a loose bluetooth keyboard around
everywhere in case some insight were to fall upon me heavy enough to
justify reaching for it over my 6S Plus in a public venue, hunched and
squinting. There's still nothing better at cranking out copy than the
Lap Top Computer, I suppose. I was holding out for a truly-substantial
alternative to Windows 10 and macOS, wanting to be enchanted by lite
delights like Acer's cheeky Chromebook R11, but had decided in self-pity
that I'd probably never be able to stand a new operating system ever
again.

My mom graciously decided to take me mall shopping for Christmas, which
is comforting in its tradition of vapid routine. The state of a given
midwestern metropolis's mall is a keen indicator of the culture's soul,
I've found, and ours is mostly crewed by destitute alcoholics, who are
my closest kin, and therefore my most appropriate company for /the
holidays/.

*Dillard's is the second-best place to lose your mind in America.*

Even now, when the somber corners are not quite so desolate. The
acoustic sensation cannot be experienced anywhere else -- the
battlecries of the Me Generation's pop reproduced by hateful diaphragms
behind their white plastic ceiling facades and absorbed again by
palletloads of mass-manufactured stonewashed denim, seemingly coming
from a far-off wholesale nether no matter where in the store you've been
buried. Ours is a few decades old, now -- weathered and alone, which
accentuates the whole dystopia with a resolute air of infinity, as if
it's certain it will outlast me. It probably will.

[[file:xhtml/https:/i.snap.as/ggT8UR5.jpg]]

I was deep within it all when I came across Dan Seifert's
[[http://web.archive.org/web/20161224044948/http://www.theverge.com/2016/12/12/13914962/hp-spectre-x360-review-2016-laptop][praising
review]] of the HP Spectre x360. As I've constantly confessed, /The
Verge/‘s lot are the only institution of their kind I've come close to
trusting /too much/, so it was no small thing to see something so
certain as “the premium laptop to buy this year” in his subhead.

The last time I was in the market for a laptop, there was little room
for aesthetics in the equation. We have been taught this past decade
that beautiful devices come in fruit form, only. Somehow, I allowed
myself to integrate the ridiculous sentiment that MacBooks were the only
option for anyone with any reverence for tactile experience. As I expect
you're aware of to at least some degree by now, Apple's diligent study
of desirability over the years is the singular force behind their
lordship, and it's the token MO of tech opinion to confuse it with sex
appeal, resulting in expressions like “[apple hardware device] is sexy,”
which is a pityingly desperate delusion. Do you actually find brushed
aluminum appealing in any bodily sense?

We did once, of course. Your infatuation with the stuff probably peaked
the moment you first grazed it, and -- if you're anything like me -- you
could be harboring more aesthetic frustration with their longstanding
occupation than you think. Infatuation must be starved to survive, and
we've been eating up Apples by the bushel for a decade.

Haha.

But really, though -- by the /billion/.

I saw images in that Spectre review which I was completely satisfied
with. I watched that new HP logo as it traveled through the frames,
stupefied. Out of precious ignorance, I experienced real desire in that
undesirable place. (Which could actually represent some sort of defeat
on my part, but I'm not too bothered.)

[[file:xhtml/https:/i.snap.as/wcEdRy2.jpg]]

And in the midst of those desolate people in their fortress of
mediocrity, my mom and I hatched a plan to indulge upon the best part of
desolation -- impulsive, subsidized gluttony. We'd stop by the pharmacy
to fill my anti-depressant script before renavigating Bourgeois Bumper
Cars to get to Best Buy, where she'd let me use her credit line to
purchase my final choice in the segment.

*Best Buy is the best place to lose your mind in America.*

I could've sworn it made good sense to me, once -- in Middle School,
when my friend and I were spending most of our free time emulating the
first generation of tech-reviewing YouTubers -- but now, it reminds me
of a darkwood restaurant with its closing fluorescents on, shining in
the inverse frequency of a bug zapper -- casting a more
effectively-repelling ambiance for the human psyche than anything else
/I'm/ capable of dreaming up, at least.

I used to fucking /visit/ that store for no purpose but to see and
experience the diluted bit of the handset renaissance with enough
momentum to coast its way here. I probably spent a full sixty minutes
wandering around by my own volition on a handful of occasions.

But these days, I am perturbed from the onset in a big way. There are
too many blue vape enthusiasts on the sales floor at any given time, and
they all want me to leave. They loaf around the carcass of consumer
technology's passion, not realizing, I guess, that I already know it
'twas they who killed it. (The stench is strongest by the wearables.)
It's eerie how little the Big Box itself has changed, considering the
decade their goods have traveled.

Under a fittingly-gray sky, I wash my pill down with La Croix and a Kind
bar to preempt the appropriate rumination in my mouth as we inch toward
my Final Financial Doom with the spooked sliders. Though we never exceed
5mph, there are abandoned vehicles littering the shoulders and medians
in varyingly absurd orientations. But I do not jest -- today, I am
silent, for I am one of them.

By the time we reach the store, my medicine has once again placed my
soul in Safe Mode, so we shuffle into the grotesque thing. There are
four employees in sight -- no one else -- and they all send their beady
eyes my way. I have too much purpose in my consumerist jowls to pause,
though, so I rush to the laptops near the opposite wall in an attempt to
get an early estimate on my current level of personal computing idiocy.
Naturally, my Mom snags one of another four associates immediately. In
this work, I shall refer to him as Zoroaster.

[[file:xhtml/https:/i.snap.as/pCbk7GB.jpg]]

Despite having never seen 80% of the displayed devices in person before,
I am able to spot the Spectres quickly, which is a good sign. I am
immediately elated by the contrast to the depressing mushbooks I
remember HP making in the oughts. The bezel... the brilliance of the
display... the details of the visible body. I open /Extratone/. I open
/The Verge/. I am hoping that Windows 10 will not be as much of a kicker
as I've expected.

I'm not a minute before Mom and Zoroaster have found the new MacBook
Pros. Nobody remembers the password to the 13-inch, but the 15 is
showing off its “deep blacks” and “Space Gray” mood. The Verge looks
phenomenal, and its icon in the touchbar catches my eye. I manage to use
it to switch tabs, the less-attuned degenerate in me noting the extra
spanning required over CMD-TAB.

“Have you tried the new keyboard?” asks Zoroaster.

I hadn't. It's as indescribable as you've heard, but suggests legitimacy
is Apple's effort to bridge the transition from physical keyboards to
their touch replacement. Terrifying legitimacy.

“You get used to it,” he says.

I open Pages and click out something ridiculous. Yeah... /click/. I'm
sure there's a better onomatopoeia available by way of just about any
technology website, but I didn't bother to study the sensation after
realizing that it's a con for my number one use of a Portable Computer
-- */clacking/*.

It's not as if the thing isn't gorgeous, though, in its way. After years
of usership, I can tell you that it is undoubtedly a superb execution of
the MacBook marque. It's polished. It's The New One. But it is also
bleak and slateish. Some might even say /dystopian/. Do I want to carry
such a thing around with me everywhere? Do I even want to carry it /out
of the store?/ What will I tell my friends? /What will I tell my staff?/

$2,000 of my future spent on what is now a piece of /distinctly/
establishment design...

I return to the x360 to see what can be done about Windows' appearance
these days.

/Purple-gray taskbars... Hm./

*It's a sale.*

Let me be honest with you -- I spent some ninety minutes going between
the two. Even if I'd endured the shame and self-disappointment of
choosing the MacBook Pro, the simple grunt of the /challenge/ the
Spectre presents to it is no small milestone.

As Zoroaster scrambles to remove my new machine from /The Hanging Jail/,
I am drained from the decision, but aware that my perspective on the
world has changed. I've been working on an editorial for the past few
weeks that's mostly alarmed howling about the industry's utter lack of
passion, as of late, but seeing the Windows-running department's devices
and their matured design -- /finally/ beautiful without obvious Apple
influence -- had truly revived some little flame of hope within me.

Lithe Zoroaster was confused by UPCs a bit, as is understandable, and
began juggling three Spectre boxes atop the prison lift, screaming the
numbers -- one at a time from each device -- to his bewildered disciple,
below.

Throughout the later half of the whole ordeal, I'd had company -- some
sort of blonde working man who'd also braved the frictionless waste to
calm himself with debt. I'd been elated at the opportunity for
companionship, at first, but he'd found himself unable to escape the
store's bespoke Apple Hole. I did my best to help him, but failed hoist
his girth from the 15's benchmark suction. I'd left him there, bound.
May my dreams n'er be haunted by the fading portrait of his tortured,
middle class face.

As the Best Boys did their dance, he somberly came to my side. The
grimace he'd worn in the struggle had fallen away. I knew what was
coming before he formed the defeated words: “go ahead and grab me the
500 while you're up there.”

As one does when they stumble upon a stranger's funeral, I bowed my
head.

Here begins the part that sorta makes me look like an idiot.

After signing my mother's lengthy loan agreement, Zoroaster -- the
little devil -- asked if I wanted the /Special Edition/, just behind me.
I'd stopped by last year's Big Boy Spectre -- the ballsy-ass
copper-toned masterpiece -- and had wished for a moment that the look
could've carried to the fresher x360.

The monospace Hewlett-Packard logo blinded me, and the unlit display (it
hadn't been set up yet) concealed the wider bezel of... The older
Spectre 13t -- with which I write, now.

I didn't notice my blunder until after our treacherous return, and could
not care less.

/The following was sent as part of [[https://tinyletter.com/DavidBlue][a
personal TinyLetter]] I've just begun in the hopes of rejuvenating my
ability to tell stories./

There are a few entities which continue to validate what I'm pursuing,
but [[https://twitter.com/joshuatopolsky][Joshua Topolsky]] and his
[[https://theoutline.com/][/The Outline/]] are particularly worth
noting. In search of reassurance, I listened to a
[[https://digiday.com/podcast/outlines-josh-topolsky-theres-much-sameness-digital-media/][podcast]]
he appeared on in February, last night, and also found
[[https://longform.org/posts/longform-podcast-27-joshua-topolsky][one]]
from 2013, when he was still EiC of /The Verge/. Basically the entirety
of the first is within the idealism I've risked most of myself for, in
case you're curious. I've looked up to Topolsky in a huge way, this past
year. He has done -- and is doing -- many things which I am
intrinsically drawn to earn for my legacy, and the presence of his wife
on his staff (their few
[[https://soundcloud.com/tomorrowpodcast/episode-28-laura-june-and-the-contrarian-disposition][podcasts]]
together are adorable in a very particular way,) is idyllic in
appearance, at least. I love the way they talk about each other. I
suppose spousal editorial staff is probably the personal hell of a good
many people. Perhaps, it's even my own. Listening to him talk on
Digiday, though, reminded me -- along with a few other works I've
consumed lately -- that /technically/, /Extratone/ is a /business./ Or
at least... That it must become one eventually or die forever. While
trying to explain my future plans to a friend, I inadvertently layed out
some 'steps for growth.'

1. *Form and activate the community.*
2. *Build a beautiful, one-of-a-kind method of content delivery.*
3. *Attain a fairly dependable content cadence.*
4. *Sell the product in a way that immediately and -- from then on --
   consistently ensures and/or furthers its quality.*

I guess we're somewhere between 2 and 3 right now. I'm still building a
body of written work more or less on my own, which is okay, considering
that nobody is paid. I suppose it'd be most desirable -- before I move
to the Northwest -- to figure out how to make /The Tone/ as much of a
learning experience for my closest staff as possible. And regardless of
all other external goals of the magazine, I think it is more than safe
to say that I've learned more in the past 10 months from a fucking
WordPress website than I would've if I'd spent that time at the
Journalism school. The first annual renewal payment for extratone dot
com just went through, actually. A year ago, I was /much/ more
entertaining, but virtually directionless. I honestly can't tell if I
feel any better internally, day-to-day, but I know I am at least
attaining the capability of real friendship for the first time in my
life, and I suppose that's more than worth losing virtually all of my
engagement on Twitter.

Perhaps its even worth losing a portion of the freshness in my
perspective -- the stuff I thought made it worth it in the first place.
Especially if my staff maintains it healthily within their own.

I'll admit that -- in retrospect, after spending a year reading,
writing, and digitally fussing -- a lot of my original content smells
like edgy nonsense. Some of the work within our network does too,
honestly, but it's usually much less so.

Of course, that transition required an excruciating crucible, for me,
but that's exactly why I'm incessantly compelled to make as much use of
my trauma as possible: so that my friends and staff may be able make
progress toward more fulfilling lives without such a massive up-front
cost.

As I was writing my [[https://bit.ly/hellbird][interview with mastodon's
creator]], I kept an eye out for related coverage, and eventually saw
what
/[PCMag/]([[http://www.pcmag.com/article/352875/what-is-mastodon-and-will-it-kill-twitter]])
did, and it's unwanted rant-spuringly aggravating language.

For most of my adult life, I've been trying to figure out why
publications like /PCMag/ feel it necessary to belittle their audience
/and/ their subjects to such a degree. Silicon Alley can't possibly be
/that/ vapid as to nix all soul in any story, ever.

[[file:xhtml/http:/gallery.tinyletterapp.com/e8ecb4f78686444d5a5c89d53c49de7c8feb8ac5/images/f15ad2c3-dbd3-4697-9c37-b4d97f260dd8.png]]
/I mean... What in the hell is this, even?/

I haven't been a reader since I used to loiter in Barnes & Noble with a
pile of print editions in the oughts, but this sort of layout has got to
be some kind of *digital sin.*

I'm not going to bother digging through the publication to compare this
work with others for the moment. Perhaps one day, I'll feel the need to
polish this rant into an argument and make it more visible. Surely,
though, the proximity of this abomination to the word /Mag/ or even
/Magazine/ must keep /somebody/ awake at night.

That's not to say it doesn't take some sort of discipline. I doubt I
could write in this way without hulking hyper-deliberately over
/wherever the fuck this dialect comes from./ I think it's almost
certainly more efficient as an informative device than my piece, or
[[https://motherboard.vice.com/en*us/article/mastodon-is-like-twitter-without-nazis-so-why-are-we-not-using-it][Sarah
Jeong's]], but the assumption that readers would be so disinterested as
to hesitate to even commit to /complete sentences/ regarding something
/actually/ newsworthy for a technology publication should be taken
personally.

/(This is going to echo what Topolsky said in both of those podcasts in
big ways, but I'll try to keep it relatively brief.)/

*I believe there is an audience that is craving attention to detail in
their stories, a more intimate, longer-lasting, and more invested
relationship with a much smaller number of publications.*

Even a sense of involvement in the process. It's probably a direct
result of my longtime consumption of car magazines -- most of which
still have sizable sections dedicated to direct, public correspondence
with readers. It's also cross-platform to a surreal degree. Auto
journalists of all tiers will straight up engage with you on Twitter.
(/MotorTrend/ literally prints YouTube comments.)

Sure, the readership is old, and the topic is an outlier (it's fairly
common knowledge that 'car people' are waaaay more vulnerable to
obsession than other special interest communities,) but the species is
more or less the same, and the results are plain as day, any time you
care to look. In recently returning my attention to technology
journalism, I've noticed an irritating affront to meta conversation with
strangers. My theory is that they've been paid for their words so long
that they develop a very particular greed towards them, which is why
academic journalism institutes are immediately shunned by their alumni
after graduation until they are definitely Too Tired to sling copy and
begin to climb sortof diagonally through editorial titles until they are
stashed away in some hole. Then, after ruminating until their first
encounter with Actual Death -- if they're still interested in the whole
thing -- they crawl out to be propped up in front of moderately sized
bodies of petrified students to scream in 100% bitterness about /The
Ethics/ that plagued them spiritually and financially their entire
career at the acolytes as their last joke on the world.

But they won't engage with strangers on Twitter.

As someone who -- for better or worse -- chose to sidestep the academic
route, I will never advocate for any value in withholding information --
especially funny stories -- about /Extratone/'s operation. If anything,
/rediscovering relevance/ is a wholly meta pillar of our editorial bent.
(Hence, why Tim calls us /The Nieman Lab of Community College./)

I also believe the subscriber & advertising revenue models are
/directly/ - if not /primarily/ - involved in the constriction of
conversations regarding a publication's operation. It's my goal to
cultivate a group of subscribers that are directly invested in the
product (there's another new word on my part) financially,
intellectually, and emotionally. It's not exactly unheard of, ya know.

/Anywho/, I'm going to leave you in peace for now. I've really enjoyed
this wanton spewing of conjecture, but then... who doesn't love to go
on, unchecked?

Is /this/ what blogging is? It's fucking obnoxious.

Thank you for reading and /beware the fucking egg/.

** Eugen Rochko has spent this year perfecting federated social media in
Mastodon -- his open source project. We spoke to him just hours before
it became a global tech conversation.

   :END:

The saga of Twitter, Inc. has been rejuvenated in 2017 by Tump's antics,
corporate drama, and an amalgam of user and non-user disquiet with its
decisions, though its financial viability has been in prominent industry
conversation for half a decade. Since its pre-2010 outset, many 'a'
feature has accumulated on its original, still-iconic skeletal software,
and -- though the net is undoubtedly positive -- a few have gone.

Last Thursday, the company revised in bravado its poultrian default
profile picture and its system of replies to exclude @s on all of
Twitter's proprietary services, drastically changing two of its visual
mainstays, and prodding a particularly lucent cacophony. Turn your ear,
and you'll hear many familiar terms in the chants: /limits, chains,
strings, harassment, feedback, gamergate, nazis, etc./

These conversations are important, but they've gotten awfully stale.

If you listen a bit more carefully, you'll intercept a new one:

/Mastodon/.

It's the open source brainchild of Eugen Rochko, who's known
colloquially as [[https://mastodon.social/@Gargron][Gargron]].

He's had one hell of a week.

Between the night of our first emails and our conversation, his flagship
[[http://mastodon.social/][mastadon.social]] instance had doubled in
users. Less than two hours after we said our goodbyes, his name was on
/The Verge/'s front page.

Despite the urgency of it all, he graciously lent me his time just after
breakfast on Tuesday to discuss himself and the story behind the
project, while the most significant day of his life was building around
him.

“I'm perfectly fine with being called /Eugene/ by Americans.”

Though the ink's still fresh on his compsci diploma, he's clearly
prepared for the American press.

[[https://open.spotify.com/episode/6QKhv7jaZsAHJxBjyiyZf7?si=I_eqn5Q6Q2aXi04Nq10LJw]]

--------------

*What's the story behind the project? Do you remember the specific
moment when you decided to do this?*

Many years ago, I had a friend that was really into federated networks
when they were a new thing. That was when
[[http://identi.ca/][identi.ca]] was first created -- at the very
beginning of my developer knowledge and career.

A good portion of the stories written so far on his platform have framed
it as an alternative to Twitter, which early Masto adopters refer to as
“Hellbird,” or “the bird website.” Eugen isn't afraid to acknowledge his
investment in the format.

I was a heavy Twitter user and I wasn't happy with where Twitter was
going, so I decided to check on how the federated stuff was doing in the
meantime. I found it in a very sad state, but thought I could
contribute.

He began building on his own, with Tweetdeck's standard in mind.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  I thought 'if I'm going to do something, it needs to have realtime
  updates and it needs to have columns.' I started with a bare-bones
  prototype while still [at University] in May or April of last year. It
  had no user interface, only an API that I was using from the command
  line. And I thought 'okay, it works. that's great.' Then, exams came.
#+END_QUOTE

Academics had to come before the project at first, but it soon supplied
an ample post-graduation diversion. He focused his energy on building
something more complete and eventually launched a
[[https://www.patreon.com/user?u=619786][Patreon page]].

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  I [[https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=13303346][announced]] it on
  HackerNews, and that was the first public release of the project.
  That's when I got my first users who weren't my friends, and some who
  were new to federated networks.
#+END_QUOTE

That was just over 100 days ago, and it gave way to his first feedback.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  I started working on the first feature requests, shaping the project a
  bit differently. People were a lot more focused on privacy features
  than I thought they would be, although in retrospect, it makes sense.
  The previous [federated] project -- GNU social -- did not really have
  a focus on privacy features, or anything built in by default.
#+END_QUOTE

It compelled him to change things, and his work was well received.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  Over time, I kept working on new features, and waves of new users came
  when it went viral in certain circles. The first was HackerNews and
  Product Hunt. [[https://twitter.com/aral][Aral Balkan]] -- a Twitter
  user with over 30,000 followers -- picked up the project, gave it a
  shout out, and even did a giveaway of his app. He had a lot of
  followers from Holland; the Mastodon timelines became mostly Dutch.
#+END_QUOTE

Next was Marxist anime Twitter (including
/[[http://mastodon.social/@extratone][Extratone]]/ and
[[http://bit.ly/dbmastodon][I]].)

Lots of furries; lots of LGBT people. That's when I really focused on
privacy features and making sure all blocks worked because these
individuals needed a safer platform than Twitter could offer.

[[file:xhtml/https:/i.snap.as/0bAIHB6.png]]

/Sidekick dashboard background processing jobs as of Tuesday morning./

“As you can see, the first bump is HackerNews, the second is Aral
Balkan, and then anime/Marxist Twitter.”

And the last -- now a bit out of date -- is this week's spike, which is
nearly double all previous waves.

*Are you responsible for all of the code?*

You can look at the [[https://github.com/tootsuite/mastodon][GitHub
page]] to see a specific breakdown of who contributed and how many lines
of code, each. You'll see I'm at the top by a large margin, but there
are [additional] people who've contributed interesting, good features &
fixes, localizations, user guides, and documentation.

*What's the story behind the name?*

It's not particularly interesting. I'm a progressive metal fan, and I
listen to /Mastodon/ sometimes. They have a really cool name that refers
to a really cool animal. It's a fluffy elephant! What's not to love?

It's also the inspiration for Mastodon's mascot, which was penned by
Rochko's YouTuber friend
[[https://www.youtube.com/user/dopatwo][Dopatwo]] after he realized how
urgently he required an error page.

*What does “federated” mean to you?*

The biggest problem with this term is that it's new for lots of people.
People who've come across federated networks in the past/instantly/
understand what it means and how it works, and people who are new to the
concept have a lot of trouble before it clicks. But when Twitter first
started, people didn't understand what 'retweeting' meant, so it's not a
unique problem domain.

I don't know where it comes from -- maybe BitTorrent -- but people seem
to think that when something is 'decentralized,' everybody gets the same
thing; that it's all synchronized one to one. In actuality, 'federated'
means that people in different instances can /talk/ to each other, but
the /content/ is different depending on the users there, what they do,
and who they follow.

Though instances are infrastructurally independent, they can communicate
with one another. On a user level, timelines are still determined by who
you do and do not follow across the entirety of all instances.

*What if Twitter comes to you in the near future with a job offer?*

[Rochko laughs.]

If it was any other company, I would think about it. A job is a staple
source of income, and -- depending on the company -- could involve doing
something important, but I have zero faith in Twitter.

*Does this all mean that I finally get to live out my serif Twitter
dream?*

Yes, I suppose on your own instance, you could change the stylesheet...

*So if I set up my own instance and started charging for its use, I'd be
in the clear, legally?*

Yes, that's okay. The code is licensed under
[[https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.html][AGPL]] version three,
which I picked because other projects in the same space are using it.
The difference between AGPL and GPL is that [the former] forces you to
contribute back to the appstream code repository if you make any
breaking changes.

For example, Eugen explained that WhatsApp originally used XMPP for its
chat protocol, which meant that Facebook and Google Talk users could
connect to it, too. However, the company progressively locked down the
platform over time, leaving virtually nothing visible that was unique to
XMPP in its current iteration.

To prevent somebody taking Mastodon code, placing it behind locks, and
stripping out the federation part to make Twitter II, I'm using this
license.

The thing to remember about free software is that 'free' means /freedom
of the user,/ not that it's zero cost. It's perfectly fine to charge for
free software because developers need to live, too.

*I've seen a lot of multilingual 'tooting' these past few weeks. Can we
expect an in-app translate function like Twitter's on Mastodon?*

I don't think I could put in a 'translate this toot' button because APIs
from Google and Bing are quite expensive at scale. I'm not 100%
promising this, but I can probably put something in where people can
select which language they post in, and then just filter the timelines.
That would at least solve the problem of being confronted with lots of
French posts, without knowing any French.

*The only complaint about Twitter I remember that hasn't already been
addressed here is the capability of editable 'toots.' Is that a
possibility?*

That won't happen. There's actually a good reason why they don't do
that. It's simply because you could make a toot about one thing, have
people favorite it and share it, link it from other places, and then
suddenly, it says 'Heil Hitler,' or something.

[[file:xhtml/https:/i.snap.as/jrP0kLj.png]]

It's a bit preposterous to continue the conversation as if Twitter and
Mastodon are interchangeable entities. They exist in separate
ideological and mechanical spheres, and will both continue to do so for
a very long time.

That said, the fundamental user interface design and current
cross-community user saturation /do/ warrant comparisons between their
functions. More likely than not, you'll create a Mastodon account
because a link found you on Twitter, use it because you prefer its type
of ecosystem, and you'll stay after realizing that nearly all of your
age-old qualms have been addressed, if not already rectified. While
/FOSS/ and /Federated/ may seem at times like jejune ideologies, their
advantages are especially tangible in this context. Should you find
yourself needing to complain about something, you'll find an audience.
Perhaps it'll be your command line.

It's nothing but negligent to describe Mastodon as an /alternative/ or
/clone/.

It's more like Twitter's son.

It's leaner, quicker-to-change, much more flexible & democratized, and
less corrupt. Though I didn't ask its creator what he intended to gain
from all his effort, I think his commitment itself denotes a
preoccupation with progress. Those of you who've been let down by the
tools you've been given to control your words' exposure will find
startling competence in your ability to determine per-toot privacy, or
reserve your raucous photos and terrible memes from followers who are
not necessarily complicit consumers. Naturally, it's also much less
dependable, though a single instance outage will never leave you truly,
completely silent. And the support will come.

It's been a privilege to be observer and participant in the first
lightening of a new online community. In the moment, we enjoy our
lavender haze -when the spaces are filling primarily with users who are
sincerely interested enough in discourse to have sought it out.

Sarah Jeong's
[[https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/mastodon-is-like-twitter-without-nazis-so-why-are-we-not-using-it][account]]
of her Twitter exile is a good, long read if you're craving more
specifics, and Eugen's [[https://medium.com/@Gargron][Medium]] offers a
more complete explanation of federation and its place in the industry,
straight from the source. Apparently, he's just as articulate with words
as he is with code.

If I had to hazard a guess, I'd bet it's
[[https://usesthis.com/interviews/eugen.rochko/][not the last we'll hear
from him]].

** The monumental amount of unsubstantiated gossip and conjecture
enabled every day by Facebook is lethal to the human intellect. Can fire
be fought with fire?

   :CUSTOM_ID: section0036.xhtml#the-monumental-amount-of-unsubstantiated-gossip-and-conjecture-enabled-every-day-by-facebook-is-lethal-to-the-human-intellect-can-fire-be-fought-with-fire
   :END:

Today, after positing on whether or not a pastry was in fact the
namesake of the battleship /Bismarck/, I was told by its owner -- a
local woman of a far-from-excusable age -- that “[I] should be on that
big bang show.” Upon such fuckery, I looked her in her eyes and informed
her that she'd just changed my plans for the night: I was now going to
go home, wrap my lips around the barrel of my Beretta, and blow my
brains out. I should've known better than to so jest with a boomer
immediately after receiving such glaring indicators of minimal
intellectual function, but I fell for the hope -- as I often do, to no
avail -- that such a jarring reaction would encourage reflection on her
foul, tragically misled sentiments regarding the general state of youth,
and perhaps even spare a peer or two from future tribulation.

Instead, she called the police.

Three round cops found me, an hour later, approaching hesitantly.
Strangely enough, they were chuckling -- maybe to a little joke about
all the recent hubbub on the radio covering a recent wave of blatantly
negligent medical care in American prisons, though I hope nervous
laughter is just /SOP/ when responding to a suicide threat. As all
Columbia cops always are toward me, they were aggravatingly genuine and
hilariously understanding. I began by simply recreating my interaction
with their summoner, quoting her word-for-word, and -- I swear to my new
Lord -- all three immediately released a choral “ohhhhh” in unison. I'll
never know for sure if they actually assimilated the reality of the
situation so quickly, but it'd certainly seem that way.

Clearly, I should've threatened /her/ life.

Despite the day-to-day expression of our recurring wisdoms, habits,
instincts, patterns and cycles of cultural metamorphosis in the
discourse, the stream of “well, you know they were sayin' the world was
going to end when /I/ was in elementary school” to my ear has fallen
abruptly silent since the inauguration. Our parents and grandparents are
both impossibly fortunate and unfortunate, having to duck out as the
most multiplicative (read: sickest) cerebral orgy in the history of
mankind will just've begun nibbling on the slope to its climax. We'll be
lucky if we'll still be able to articulate our goodbyes by the time they
reach the door. Nonsense does a fuckin number on perceived wisdom, but
the gaps /are/ widening at a dangerous pace. Tectonic or domestic, we
are all straddling expanding space, and the chill of its draft is now
stealing too much of our heat to ignore.

Though it is entertaining in the moment (and otherwise redundant,) it
would not be /well-to-do/ of me now -- nor was it, then -- to leave the
conversation in edgy absurdity. Yes, a part of me would like to campaign
for /Sheldon/ to be reclassified as an expletive, in disgust, but -- as
an adult in all-out sprint to make up for stalled emotional development
-- I must note that such a display of concern should've been at least
reciprocated with a bit of explanation, if not appreciation. Still,
there are much more appropriate reasons and situations in which to waste
public servants' time.

It's not news -- the /Theory/ is providing /some/ ghoulishly skewed
portrayal of less-than-forty pseudointellectuals. Obviously, my savior's
time was worth very little to her, but the fact that she spent any
quantity of anything at all engaging with even a decidedly mainstream
generationally ambassadorial bridge could be regarded -- if stretched --
as the result of a curious seed, which has skyrocketed in human value,
as of late. It is undiscouragable. Read the trail a bit, and you'll find
that your frustration is simply an expression of the terror that's
ignited by the stagnancy of their pace.

/It's great that you've managed to inch over to modern-ish sitcoms from
Judge Judy and/ Independence Day /, mom, but you're gonna have to/
*/really pick up the pace/* /and work on following a few body
modification communities on the darknet./

If an absence of /solutions/ are the crux of the /blog/, here I'm now
gloating.

To whom does the commoner look to for such solutions when they'd prefer
not to terrorize their kooky middle age parents into a half century of
brutal fasting under vows of silence?

The Big Thinkers! The Men of the Hour.

Yes, /men./ All Big Bumbling Billionaire Imbeciles.

Elon Musk /cannot/ be the Nicola Tesla of the 21st century, or even the
/20th/, for that matter, because literally /every/ mechanically-minded
professional I've ever heard talk about battery technology has condemned
it in some manner as an inescapable dead end, developmentally. Perhaps,
then, the champion of electrochemical storage is /the/ False Prophet.

No, I'm not capable of citing research or conjuring Mars-capable
spacecraft, but I've been a bit too preoccupied with my country's class
war and its [[http://bit.ly/unescoliteracy][10% adult illiteracy rate]].
It's all well and good to be privy to romanticism, but it's not the
1960s anymore. Even Howard Hughes would be more concerned for the
wellness of the species than our continued reach for the stars, were he
still alive.

Well. Maybe not...

Charles Lindbergh would be, though.

We spent the 1990s preparing to rid ourselves of history because the
smartest among us foresaw some facsimile of the renaissance we are
currently experiencing. If they'd been shown a glimpse of
[[http://bit.ly/measuringconsumerinfo][some statistics]] on the volume
of media we consume, they'd exclaim of their pride -- no doubt -- in
their species' capability to progress, and perhaps even their own
contribution to it. However, extended observation of an average
American's day-to-day life would be lamented, in disgust, and a
[[http://bit.ly/millennialspew][huge portion]] of the blame can be
placed on one t-shirt-touting cyberyokel: Mark Zuckerberg.

His name is stupid, his spawn is ruining my life, and he continues to
insist upon saying shit that frightens the bejesus out of me.

[[https://backchannel.com/we-are-entering-the-era-of-the-brain-machine-interface-75a3a1a37fd3][Zuckbrain]]
is fucking scary.

“[[http://bit.ly/zuckfuck][Wiring the globe]]” is fucking scary.

[[http://bit.ly/zuckbot][Jarvis]] is fucking scary.

But Fuck, himself wouldn't be at all intimidating without his money. The
scariest bit is the lack of /class/ in the criticisms of his
intellectual influence. Farhad Manjoo's
[[http://bit.ly/fuckbug][attention]] has been diligent and premium as a
/Times/ er's should be, but the same occupation bars him from authoring
with the color of unsubstantiated claims.

Mine does not.

Elon Musk is not an apologetic genius. He's willing to
[[http://bit.ly/aloofmusk][joke]] about his intellectual distance from
the planet and its populace on Twitter. Apparently, his mind's even
surpassed the need to punctuate. Crazy.

Google is well on it's way to becoming the neo-Vatican... yada yada
yada, but they're too far gone -- I do not have the expertise to address
them. Fuck, though, is a singular short-sleeved, /Even Stevens/ -haired
young man [[http://bit.ly/crowdfuck][without]] so much as private office
space (even though his sentiments on breathing room at home are
[[http://bit.ly/fuckflex][obviously inverse]].)

Clearly, it's all just to protect him from the truth: *The Apostle
John's* */Book of Revelation/* *is about Facebook*. Fuck's cyberchild is
the horseman, the beasts, /and/ the plagues, stuffed into one tyrannical
website.

Of course, it's unlikely that Mark's essence was bred entirely of evil,
but -- like Tump, in many ways -- he is an excruciatingly wealthy idiot.
Though he /is/ spending 2017 touring the United States, he
[[http://bit.ly/fucklearning][doesn't seem]] to be all that interested
in /actually/ closing the gap between himself and the rest of us, which
suggests that he only wants us to throw us off his extra-terrestrial,
xenophobic scent. I can't imagine what /The Mothership/ would really
want with my Amazon browsing history, though.

Just to be clear, *he is not* */The Antikhristos/*.

He'd better not be, anyway. I'd be absolutely Livid with Lucifer if his
choice of a figurehead for his Big Plan was such a Fucking dork.

I mean... if Fuck wanted to spend his time crafting 6000-word essays,
why the Fuck didn't he just build a Fucking CMS back in his Jesse
Eisenberg era instead of /the actual/ weekly-updated tower of digital
Babylon? Surely, Satan would know better than to waste resources and
pulverize creativity by ordering his Demonic Dev team to release regular
builds for build's sake rather than on a per-need basis, but that'd be
because The Tempter is an authority on /incentive/ as thoroughly as Fuck
isn't.

If you're equipped with the privilege of literacy, you've been reading a
lot about Fuckbook's political consequences, recently. Frankly, /it's
about Fucking time/, but I'm compelled to emphasize that the most
significant motor driving the politik is fueled by the eldest,
fossilized portions of our thought meat. According to Manjoo, “the News
Feed team's ultimate mission is to figure out what users want,” dipping
in Facebook's ocean of action data, searching for a soul.

Yet another Fuckism that suggests he's an alien: everybody knows that
/nobody/ knows what they want.

There's a central mechanic of our brains that by nature wreaks a whole
helluva lot of contradiction. If you've ever mentioned ADHD with your
doctor, or know a hypochondriac/adderall fiend who has, you may have
heard it described as “the lizard brain.” Simply put, it's the brain
stem, and it's responsible for the most basal and primitively emotional
instincts and habits; an anti-intellectual agitant, arguing at all times
for the course of action with the most immediate gratification. /The
Great Clickbait War/ of 2013 was a startling demonstration that revealed
the strength of the hold Fuckbook had (and still has) on these reptilian
bits -- the true location of its power.

“In surveys, people kept telling Facebook that they hated teasing
headlines. But if that was true, why were they clicking on them?”

/Volition/ is the Word of the Day. Here, we must once again invoke an
ancient parable from the wise foretellings of the Disney film, /Smart
House/: *when dealing with human beings, boundless compliance quickly
leads to abject misery for all parties involved.*

Mindlessly, habitually, endlessly clicking... *this is how we die*.

Something about Fuck's direction is fundamentally poisonous to the human
mind. Yes, he /is/ assuredly too Fucking democratic, but misinformation
is far from the only form of evil his creation has assumed. If you can
jog your memory back a bit, you'll remember a much wider variety of
brain-rotting filth.

In lapses of their existences' finitude, the 40-something second cousins
of the world may still send you the occasional /Can Crunch Saga/ invite,
jarring you back to Jr. High in 2009, and forever associating themselves
in your mind with the horrors of mortality and *f u c k b o o k g a m e
s.*

Elon is a more likely candidate, but I'll leave those differentiations
to the not-idle cult masses.

More than one sixth of all living eyes
[[https://newsroom.fb.com/company-info/][see]] Fuckbook every single
day, placing its consumption behind only eating and drinking as the most
universally human activity.

Mr. Fuck achieved his vision and became perhaps the greatest purveyor of
words who's ever lived. He's taught (or... is teaching) us something
very profound about ourselves: capability is not the whole of the
equation. Ability on its own cannot guarantee growth, but it can often
result in decay. Discussion does not inherently lead to /connection/.
Population is not a cure for isolation.

That said, I must begrudgingly admit to you that I, myself am one of the
100 million users who've depended upon a “very meaningful” Fuckbook
group for a “physical support structure” for which I have Fuck to thank.

I've spent half of my existence watching cheesy barnstorming movies,
whirling around die-cast biplanes, seeking out stories from old pilots
-- military and commercial, and eventually trained to become one myself.
As regular activities at young ages do, aviation became deeply ingrained
into my identity, but my local community is /very/ sparse -- it's not
exactly /cool/, these days. On Fuckbook, an unofficial group for members
of the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association has allowed me to stay
connected to the rest of the world's Soaring Nerds, which is no small
deal. It's the only forum which I am compelled to participate in with
100% sincerity and emotional effect.

Photos of members standing proudly next to their first airplane, or of
adolescent students in a similar pose after their first solo, or of
three old white rubes on a hangar picnic, laughing around a fold-up
table full of rudimentary ham sandwiches in front of two gleaming
Stearmans...

They tug around on my heart like nothing else in life can.

I stopped flying lessons at 16 because I began to see behind the naivety
of my childhood perception of what it meant to fly commercially and
realized that I was unequipped for- and uninterested in the sort of
challenges it presented. I haven't flown in seven years, but the
community will /always/ have a tremendous dividend of my core being.

These days, not a single person in my day-to-day life knows or cares
about aviation, which wouldn't be laudable whatsoever -- it's not
exactly the most relevant goingson at the moment -- were it not so
/emotionally/ necessary for me.

A few days ago, a member shared a photo with the group of Charles
Lindbergh's modified Ryan cockpit, captioned “what airplane am I?”

In my youth, Lindbergh filled my closest equivalent to the 'childhood
hero' role. My grandmother bought me a first-edition copy of /The Spirit
of St.Louis/ from a small town bookshop when I was six or seven, and I
carried it /literally everywhere/ with me until middle school. I watched
the Jimmy Stewart film tens and tens of times, and I cried when I saw
the /Spirit/ in the flesh at the Smithsonian, yet I've /never/ had an
informed conversation about any of it with another human being. It
really warmed me to see how many of the comments were correct answers.

Breaking news: it's nice to know that there are other people on Earth
who give a shit about the same things you do.

Again -- aspiration should always be encouraged. This is Fuck's vision
for his creation, and it /is/ feasible, even for myself. At least his
public persona -- however valid or invalid it may be -- is making a huge
effort to have positive consequence, even if his idiocy is imbuing
itself within all of humanity.

Fuck is too powerful to be exempted from responsibility for what
Fuckbook's done to the Western psyche over the past decade, but -- like
the Christian god -- perhaps all we need require is his repentance.

In all likelihood, you have heard of Electronic Mail, but I've noticed
that much of our audience (and 18-25 year olds in general) have been
consistently estranged from it, despite its
[[http://www.journalism.org/2017/02/09/part-ii-characteristics-of-news-instances/][prevalence]]
in news media. Perhaps it's not immediately evident as /the coolest
thing/, but if “staying informed” and grass roots-ing brands are still
as hip as they appear to be, email newsletters /should/ soon become so
groovy that you'll begin leaving the house for a down-the-street coffee
shop /just to be seen reading them./

** Welcome to the wonderful world of /aggregation/.
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: section0037.xhtml#welcome-to-the-wonderful-world-of-aggregation
   :END:

In many ways, email newsletters are the antithesis of (and medication
for) Facebook's school of ruminate aggregation. You know -- the doctrine
that will forever be remembered as the original intellectual catalyst
for the downfall of human civilization. The skimming and the jumping...
how many Facebook users could I fool by simply sending featured images,
headlines, and abstracts for social cards without any hyperlinked
destination? Could I manage to get Donald Tump elected President of the
United States by way of Scrolling Hypnosis, alone?

Staying /informed/ is a habit of time-honored traditions. Gramps has
stopped by Bill's General Goods every weekday morning for twenty years
with a handful of change because /The Sleepyville Monitor/ is a part of
his identity -- dependent upon- and accountable to his trust. We've
continued into 21st century news media as if a digital equivalent of his
readership would be /so/ difficult to fathom that legacy publications
are best-off forcing the standards of print onto the web instead of
investing in research/experimentation, which is why the fucking /New
York Times/ still sends your handset away to a separate /mobile version/
of their site -- a horrible remnant of browsing from the oughts that's
rarely seen on /blogs/, these days, much less on properties of titanic
news powerhouses.

For whatever reason, most of the industry has behaved as if Grandpa's
sort of routines no longer exist in day-to-day life, but -- if anything
-- our Automated Hell is /vastly/ more saturated with them, no? Unless
you're sequestered away in a diligently self-made /Email-Free Zone/,
you're receiving shit daily. I, myself, am considerably proud of my
~60,000 unread emails, and I've conceded to the vast majority of the
popup opt-ins I've encountered since shortly after our launch because I
rarely found myself visiting/reading undesirable web.

“I don't email” is a sentiment I hear from young people often, which is
perfectly fine. I don't vote!

If it's true that “nobody wants that,” nobody should be participating in
the democratic process. Yes, I've experienced the /no patience for more
than 300 words/ phase of life, and I understand wholeheartedly the
desire to retreat forever from it all. I would much rather exist in an
old, open farmhouse with a wife, a garden, no internet, dusty old
literature, and two ancient Bentleys than spend all my time crafting
mirages in a black mirror, but neither cowardice nor negligence are
options for us, right now. This country doesn't have room for any more.

That's not to say that you should be /expected/ to read 6 hours of news
a day -- it's the media's (our) job to maintain our own accessibility,
and for this, daily/weekly newsletters are an unbelievably effective
method. The meta-aggregators in today's industry are often paid
/exclusively/ to ease your digestion, both independently and by
mastheads.

[[https://twitter.com/davepell][Dave Pell]] is a superb gateway from the
former -- an aggregation legend. His daily correspondence -- called
[[http://nextdraft.com][/NextDraft/]] /-/ is more often than not the
ideal front page of the day.

[[file:xhtml/https:/i.snap.as/FBb5naU.png]]

I'm asking those of you youths yet without your own reading habits to
trust my taste -- if not my authority -- and explore some options from
my own inbox.

Ultimately, you just can't replace a legacy die-hard-news shop for a
good political briefing. The
[[http://www.politico.com/playbook][/POLITICO Playbook/]] is the most
time-efficient way to keep up with U.S. and World politics as you walk
about your life, and many of
[[https://www.newyorker.com/newsletters?mbid=nl][/The New
Yorker/]][[https://www.newyorker.com/newsletters?mbid=nl]['s
newsletters]] are a great longform, much more visual compliment. For a
/slightly/ less-chaotic, but still relatively unproven alternative to
the former, try [[https://www.axios.com/axios-am/][/Axios AM/]].

/National Geographic/ may seem a bit /old guard/, but has remained a
consistently excellent photographic publication. Its print edition has
no place but on the poll in tangible media subscription terms, but it
/has/ been quite depressing, as of late. Turns out, we've made quite a
dystopia for ourselves, and their ability to encapsulate the world can
be overstimulating, at times. If you'd like a bit more control -- or are
uncompromisingly digital-only -- its web edition has matured quite
competently, and is elegantly parsed by
[[https://members.nationalgeographic.com/][their newsletters]]. (You'll
need to create an account, if you don't already have one.)

[[file:xhtml/https:/i.snap.as/JP71lXK.png]]

It's no secret that Medium has been on the decline, lately -- and it's
always required a particular sort of tolerance -- but /The Daily Digest/
still delivers a few important essays, occasionally. And of course --
there are options by regularity and topic, which you can fiddle with
[[https://medium.com/me/settings][here]] when logged in.

On the more innovative end of the industry, there's
[[https://theoutline.com/post/1125/subscribe-to-the-outline-newsletter][/The
Outline/]][[https://theoutline.com/post/1125/subscribe-to-the-outline-newsletter]['s
newsletter]], which -- being the property of a more deliberate,
gorgeous, open-web publication -- is a bit underwhelming, but then
again... why aren't you just looking at the site, anyway?
[[https://pudding.cool/][/The Pudding/]]'s output may be sparse, but --
again -- just... /look at it./ I can't claim to have made much use of
the information presented in their gorgeous visual essays, but it sure
is fascinating.

/The Verge/'s [[https://www.theverge.com/newsletter][Command Line]] is
often so clever, /it can almost make tech news engaging/. (Our very own
[[http://bit.ly/thetone][/The Tone/]] is directly modeled after it,
visually.) /WIRED/'s [[https://www.wired.com/newsletter][newsletter]]
isn't bad either -- it'd be excellent if its parent website wasn't so
/fucking broken./

Then there's [[https://warisboring.com/][/War Is Boring/]] /-/ a
tactical/tech news site? I recently discovered. “From drones to AKs,
high technology to low politics.” I wouldn't describe it as a primary
read for me, but it's still nice to see what the Big Boys are up to,
once in a while. (I am mostly just waiting attentively for the /U.S.S.
Iowa/ to be put up for auction.)

If you're a filthy word nerd like myself, it's likely you've seen a
Tweet or two from the [[https://twitter.com/HaggardHawks][Haggard
Hawks]] account -- [[http://www.paulanthonyjones.com/][Paul Anthony
Jones]]' highly-educated musings on “obscure words, language & etymology
facts.” After an excellent few years of playful indulgences, the project
now has a whole DweebNet with a
[[http://www.haggardhawks.com/newsletter][newsletter]] that always
fascinates, if a bit dryly. What did you expect?

/The Poetry Foundation/ can also be
[[https://www.poetryfoundation.org/newsletter][easily convinced]] to
send you their Poem of the Day, and biweekly newsletter.

And finally... *the meta media folks*.

/Columbia Journalism Review/'s always the prettiest to look at when it
comes to coverage of industry, and their squeaky-clean perspective won
me over quite quickly. They send their ultra-clean, editor-compiled
[[http://archives.cjr.org/resources/][/Weekly Highlights/]] every
Thursday. [[http://bit.ly/apneedtoknow][/The American Press
Institute/]][[http://bit.ly/apneedtoknow]['s list]] isn't a bad idea,
either. Then, of course, there's Harvard's /NiemanLab/, which offers
[[http://www.niemanlab.org/subscribe/][afternoon and Saturday morning
emails]]. All three often cite the /Pew Research Center/, which offers
i[[http://www.pewresearch.org/follow-us/][ts own palette of email
lists]], should you find yourself /hungry for d a t a/. Though, I do
not, and I enjoy them.

Landing on the “homepage” of even the most familiar online publications
can feel daunting and impersonal, but having an authority on the
industry (hopefully, with some sense of humor) parse the torrent and
deliver it unto /your personal inbox/ can ease the reading process into
a /much/ more intimate, sensical, enjoyable, and productive expenditure
of your valuable time.

For a publication of our scale, the routine of a newsletter can act
first as a simple reminder of our existence, and mature into a way to
reach out directly to our audience in a distinctly /magazine/
methodology -- one which pervades a real, consequential relationship
with consumers.

And it's d i g i t a l !!!!

** A late geezer's first go at the dystopian VR experience.
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: section0038.xhtml#a-late-geezer-s-first-go-at-the-dystopian-vr-experience
   :END:

/Listen to this article read by Siri Voice 2 below.../

Earlier this year, Tim and I had the opportunity to try virtual reality
at the True/False Film Festival in a dark, curtained side room of a
commandeered Columbia art gallery, but we were both much too intoxicated
and loopy those last few hours of the fest, and we bailed. Call us
cowards if you must --- /immersion/ can be a scary concept to those of
us who grew up reading science fiction, before the existence of the
modern video game console. I've wanted just 30 seconds or so with a pair
of goggles, just to have an idea of what the increasing number of
Oculus-blinded pedestrians surrounding me are looking at. Thanks to
Isiah, I was finally caught up last night with a few VR YouTube videos
and /Farpoint/'s introduction on a PlayStation 4.

First, Isiah brings me the headset and describes in detail how exactly
to adjust it, but I forget it all and simply try to shove it directly
and violently on my face. Eventually, he takes it back and simply mounts
and adjusts it around my monstrous skull --- like you would for a
toddler --- and I lay eyes on the console for the first time. For
whatever reason, it never occurred to me that general GUI wouldn't
simply be displayed in 2D, but by a literal /virtual display/, layed out
in front of me like a large, floor-mounted touch workstation. I'm
astonished by my ability to turn away from it to look at the rest of
/Goggleworld/, which is nothing but a deeply black void.

From my previous world, I hear Isiah and Hawthorn discussing what to
show me first, and YouTube is the settled-upon environment. As the
application is restarted in “VR Mode,” its startup screen is what
/really/ establishes the truth --- I have /gone virtual/. I cannot use
my hands to shield my eyes from the branding's glaring watermark and
terrifying red light. At its home menu, Isiah simply selects the “VR”
tab, revealing a selection of thumbnails for algorithmically-recommended
VR-shot videos on the service.

To begin, I am mounted on the tail of a superbike as it's raced around
an American desert circuit. It takes a few seconds for high resolution
to buffer, leaving me briefly in a pixelized hell that would surely make
anyone sick, were they exposed very long. (I was especially excited to
become nauseous, to no avail.) At the getgo, I am occupied with the
rider's butt since it's center-frame if I stand in my usual posture.
Isiah points out the hovering HUD to my left containing a selection of
simulated digital instruments (tachometer, 7-segment speedo, etc.) Its
presence would suggest that the purpose of my virtual passengership is
to witness the lap as a motorsport enthusiast, but the rear of the rider
obscures most of my view forward --- I cannot admire his line as one
would viewing a GoPro-or-otherwise POV of the same event, so I decide to
try and figure out which track I am hurried through. Though the vehicle
is tossed about in the required movements of motorbike operation, I
myself (the VR capture device) am impressively gyrostabilized, and the
image, static, as if I'm /actually/ hovering above the pair as they
moved along. I spin left and right, spotting a small gaggle of miniature
wind turbines and two wilting hilltop trees in the foreground. Behind
them, small sand dunes fill the space, all the way to the horizon.

After a few minutes, I am finally relieved early of my cutless lap for a
short /National Geographic/ documentary on a Viking revival festival in
Poland. I'm introduced to its Big Boys by a series of aerial shots
(presumably by drone, which is awfully un-Vikinglike) as they row their
Big Boat up(?) a relatively wide, tree-lined river. In contrast with the
lap, the jump cuts become a bit disorienting --- I am eventually jumped
/in/ the boat for a moment, next to the sweaty, bearded lads --- a few
of whom are shirtless. I notice a blurry church on the distant bank.
Suddenly, I float briskly across the small no man's land between two
rapidly advancing battle lines of Nordic Nerds with real, era-specific
weapons and way too much free time. More lingering drone shots follow
from just a few feet above the ensuing conflict. Outside, Isiah confirms
Hawthorn's suggestion that this is, indeed, /the one where they use real
weapons/ as I notice a pile of three or four men lying against each
other, motionless on the ground, right-of-center in the nearest line,
and mull over the sure disturbance of all this immersion the festival
has allowed in welcoming the presence of the surely-buzzing drone. /I
guess they're dead/.

After the conflict, I am subjected to a dreamier, narrated montage
accompanied by cheesy synthesized orchestral music and featuring
disproportionately a particular man with a shiny, tatted bald head and
rather large feet with rather small toes, which he likes to wiggle
during these particular conversations. Thanks to VR's omniencompassing
perspective, I am allowed to observe his wiggling in his every
appearance. The tone of the background music and the prevalence of
relaxed, conversing couples and sunsets in the scenes suggest
romanticism is the montage's theme, but for me, it is the bald man's
feet --- I am too busy conversing with my two friends, across the
divide, in this world, to listen to any of what is said. Considering
that YouTube collects the dimensional data regarding where the user
looks, and for how long, I make an effort to bend my neck up and down in
extremes, and notice a patch of washed-out sky, distorting in the
distance, and ponder what --- if anything --- we have gained in this
technology.

[[file:xhtml/https:/i.snap.as/ihtaDMF.jpg]]

Does an increase in the raw amount of visual data available to the
viewer actually make motion picture storytelling more effective? In the
few minutes of my VR taste test, I /did/ gain quite a bit of volition
over an equivalent 2D experience, but it didn't seem like I'd
instinctively used it to gain much else. If one is specifically
interested in the shrubbery around a racetrack, or the more nuanced
undulations of a Viking's foot, they can more likely than not find a
standard video on the World Wide Web that would more efficiently
entertain them. In specific situations, of course, a producer can
undoubtedly benefit by the ability to capture in 360 degrees, but --- in
any sort of cinema, especially --- it seems unnecessarily sacrificial to
relinquish entirely the narrative directorial control of shot framing to
their audience. However, I am the anti-expert on this subject,
obviously. My take on the viability of VR is Virtually Redundant
and --- quite possibly --- very wrong, but my time in its hell is not
over yet.

Isiah explains that it is time for me to /game/, and asks if I'd like to
try “the one with *the hands*, or the one with *the gun*.” As always, I
choose the firearm, as the “hands” have not been found yet and the
hypothetical image immediately offered up by my imagination is of rusty
iron shackles. The Infinite Blackness has returned, and I cannot see
beyond it to determine what my host is up to. Then, it becomes outer
space --- filling with thousands of star-like white dots. The light-blue
outline of a virtual PlayStation controller appears where I assume him
to be, unattached and bumbling about. Soon, it jaggedly approaches, and
I feel him hand it to me. We have started its calibration process, which
becomes a bit frightening in my celestial surroundings, though at least
I have now gained participatory power over my new existence. I'd opted
out of wearing headphones, so the assistant's malignant-sounding female
British voice comes softly from the television somewhere in front of me
as I point the beam of light the controller's representation is now
projecting straight forward at the navigational arrows displayed ahead
and pull “the trigger” (R2.)

I am pleased by the idea of interfacing with software exclusively by
shooting it repeatedly before I am abruptly contained in a cage, now
being projected by a virtualization of the system's sensor, which is
unsettling. I am now calibrating the hardware contained within the
physical device that captures the position of my body in the physical
world. I catch the word “confinement” in the assistant's unending,
otherwise-inaudible directions, and quicken my pace. When it's all done,
I return the controller to Isiah, who reboots the PS4, itself, before
launching /Farpoint/. My space becomes a lighter blue and fills with
little opaque bits of Sony Dust for a minute or two. Isiah continues his
rummaging for another peripheral as the title's introduction begins to
play.

Two rather poorly-animated astronauts are co-hosting a live broadcast
from their craft, which is presented in a dramatization of a computer
display. They've just met, but they're both stacked with academia,
co-massaging their knowledge, which I choose not to listen to. Out of
view, Isiah unsuccessfully attempts to skip the whole thing before I'm
allowed to become /virtual/ again --- this time, atop the animated body
of another astronaut in a lone shuttle, approaching the mothership where
it holds, next to a large, very-/Star Trek/ “anomaly.” From Deep Space
Nine, the two scientists continue to bicker over comms as I look around
the cockpit. Looking backwards has already become a favorite habit of
mine --- I wonder where the shuttle's bathroom is. For whatever reason,
the back of my character's neck was animated, though it can only be seen
by looking rearwards and down, which distorts its shape into something
truly terrifying.

A bunch of unrelated plot follows, leading me to end up on a foreign
world, exiting my crashed escape pod. By now, Isiah has connected /The
Gun/, but something about it isn't quite right --- my character holds it
in a glitched, very uncomfortable-looking manner, and it's suspected
that a fix would require a restart, and therefore --- a replay of the
introductory cutscene --- so I retire out of lack of patience.

If I were confidently reviewing PlayStation VR as a consumer purchase,
I'd cite a quote of Isiah's: “I couldn't find the thing.” In addition to
my first drone sighting, a few days ago in Colorado, this lost virtual
virginity is not necessarily unwelcome --- I feel as though I've
acquired a platform to better ponder the dystopia to which these and
their like industries add a certain comic spice. That said, I cannot
imagine a reason to once again enter the digital realm --- and /who
cares/?

Please enjoy your new worlds, kids.

/Listen to this article read by Siri Voice 2 below.../

Indeed, it may be the time to jab at the rural, working-class South, but
Martin McDonagh
[[http://www.slashfilm.com/martin-mcdonagh-interview/][claims]] to have
written his Golden Orb Special “eight years ago,” long before Tump, and
any critical resolution the film provides is argued haphazardly.
Consequently, its eye is cast on this strange, satirical portrayal of
the Midwest in a manner which is inaccurate and insensitive enough to
irk this Missourian. When I saw it at Columbia's Ragtag Cinema this
week, it was introduced by a young employee who noted that 1) Ebbing,
Missouri is not a real place, 2) the film was actually shot in one of
the Carolinas (an audience member suggested incorrectly that it was in
SC,) and 3) we should prepare ourselves to be roused a bit by a bar
scene in which a character pays $8 for two beers because “that just
wouldn't happen” (the Ragtag also serves alcohol.)

The “redemption arc” of the racist “hick” “loser” Officer Dixon (Sam
Rockwell) was rightfully
[[https://www.vox.com/2018/1/19/16878018/three-billboards-controversy-racist-sam-rockwell-redemption-flannery-oconnor][at
the center]] of the film's controversy, but even if one imagines his
role and fate written differently --- perhaps with him irrecoverably
shunned and/or visibly punished for his excessive, hateful
violence --- his rubishness would still be unforgivable. Living with his
mother and turtle feels like an effort to humanize him --- and, by
extension, racist small-town cops as a whole. /The Huffington Post/'s
[[https://twitter.com/zblay][Zeba Blay]] wrote an essential take on why
/Three Billboards/ --- with its terrifyingly racist dork --- was
received the way it was.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  Rockwell's character is the racist uncle whom white liberals fear and
  love. The ability to feel for him ― to root for him in spite of his
  past transgressions, because he really is a “good man at heart,” an
  idiot who doesn't know any better ― offers a kind of catharsis for the
  white viewer who can't or won't deal with true nuance, who is unable
  to reconcile their own complicity with their desire to be “good.”
#+END_QUOTE

It's not as if the film isn't technically well executed or
refreshing --- thanks in large part, yes, to Frances McDormand --- or
that I will not regret appealing on behalf of my home state, but it's
hard not to speak up when Hollywood shits so recklessly on my people. I
don't much like writing about movies because there are so many voices
who consistently speak so much more effectively. NPR's /Pop Culture
Happy Hour/, for instance, did a wonderful job
[[https://www.npr.org/sections/monkeysee/2017/12/01/567291457/pop-culture-happy-hour-revenge-redemption-and-three-billboards][dissecting]]
the film's depictions of racism and domestic violence.
[[https://twitter.com/GeeDee215][Gene Demby]] commented that “[McDonagh]
doesn't get these particular physics of American racism, and he's not
interested in them,” and I think it's reasonable to suggest that Mark's
not very versed or interested in the physics of American class, either.

If you must differentiate the state of Missouri as a cultural whole
between North and South, it is currently more red than blue --- we went
[[http://enrarchives.sos.mo.gov/enrnet/][56% for Donald and 38% for
Hillary]] --- but ask anyone from “somewhere down in the Georgia,
Florida, Alabama corner” --- as McDonagh put it -where we generally
fall, and they'd be unlikely to regard us, fraternally, as the same part
of the country. The accents in /Three Billboards/ are not among the wide
variety of local dialects you'll encounter anywhere in the state, but
perhaps they wouldn't be out of place in Sylva, North Carolina, where
the film was
[[http://wlos.com/news/local/big-movie-comes-to-sylva-shooting-dates-for-three-billboards][actually
shot]].

Regardless of all potential criticism of the film's cultural perspective
or technical excellence --- and I think most of it is more valid than
any take I could possibly offer --- my particular issue with it comes
from a culmination of tasteless decisions. If one reasonably successful
Irish director were to produce a patronizing film at the expense of
Missouri's working class filled with a ton of absurd, misconstrued
characters portrayed by A-list talent /on location/ in a real Missouri
town, the side-effectual economic benefits such a production delivers to
a locale would make it all more forgivable. /Say what you want about
us... as long as you're paying/. But to photograph such a film
completely separate Missouri --- culturally and financially --- set in a
fictional(ized) town, /include the state's name in its title/, before
conducting oneself in interviews as if we were a random target on a
“Southern” dartboard... Well, that's awfully shitty.

/Boy, working class Americans sure are a riot!/

The writing is interesting enough for this,
totally-out-of-touch“reviewer,” but I can't imagine why it won Best
Screenplay at the Globes, unless the other nominees were completely,
bleakly predictable. (I wouldn't know.) The excerpt below (*SPOILER
WARNING I GUESS? LOL*) was the most stirring part of the experience,
personally, if only because I really like films that palm strike one in
the face without warning with bizarre, chaotic vulgarity (like the
elevator scene in /Drive/.)

I suppose it could have been the result of a rational decision to give
/any/ depth to Anne (Abbie Cornish) --- who is Chief Willoughby's (Woody
Fucking Harrelson) Australian?, much-too-attractive wife --- before he
kills himself in the last third of the movie, making her suddenly
relevant. Or, perhaps it was another attempt to emphasize the emotional
repression of “Southern” folks --- one of the almost-accurate positives
of the film, if only thanks to McDormand's skill. She and Sam Rockwell
won Best Actress and Best Actor in a Supporting Role, respectively,
which makes sense --- it's a shame they accepted such an out-of-touch
work with which to demonstrate their ability to assume aloof,
emotionally-dysfunctional characters.

Growing up astride classe while traveling throughout the vast majority
of Missouri for various reasons has made me defensive, and --- while my
right to speak for hard-working Midwesterners is certainly debatable
-I'd suggest the industry at large be more diligently interested when
setting is especially emphasized. It is no longer acceptable to pass up
the opportunities McDonagh has for critical storytelling in /Three
Billboards/. Racist cops, abusive spouses, unsolved murders, and
mishandled grief are real, abundant issues in the country's breadbasket,
and they're worth discussing responsibly --- especially with such a
powerful platform. If the purpose of film writing is to help an audience
determine whether or not a work is worth spending their time and money
to see it in theaters or otherwise, I can tell you --- even within my
bias and limited authority -that this one just... isn't.

** A 'fun' movie
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: section0040.xhtml#a-fun-movie
   :END:

The Earth will reach its maximum occupancy load (12 billion) when I am
in my mid-fifties, meaning there'll be more than twice as many gorging,
shitting, shooting, complaining, and lying human beings than there were
when I started, and perhaps Brian Taylor's /Mom and Dad/ is in fact a
reasoned argument for a particular solution to our inevitable plight.
I'm still not sure what a “cult” movie is, precisely, but I can't
imagine what sort of cult could possibly sustain itself around the ethos
of this film alone, despite its concise, agitating, at once
lighthearted, yet genuinely-disturbing trip. No, it is probably not
propaganda. From the experts, you'll get /precisely/ the same review,
varying only in length. /The New York Times/' Glenn Kenny
[[https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/18/movies/mom-and-dad-review-nicolas-cage.html][couldn't
be bothered]] with more than 250 words, but RogerEbert dot com's Simon
Abrams [[https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/mom-and-dad-2018][shelled
out a whole 1000]]. They are suspiciously close to these big round
numbers --- perhaps each was written to respective quotas, and perhaps
you could say all that could reasonably be said in 10, but I don't care.

The tropes here are polished to a miraculous sheen --- two
emotionally-stunted, middleaged, overly
preoccupied-with-their-lost-youth suburban parents (Nicolas Cage and
Selma Blair) who's existing envies & irritations regarding their own
classically bratty teenage girl (Anne Winters) and her mischievous
little brother (Zackary Arthur) is merely agitated by a sudden TV
static-bound killer instinct into bloodlust, not originated. I'm not
sure any pill dealer would actually flip off their customers after a
fair buy --- even in high school, but /drugs/, a /black boyfriend/, and
a /stinkbomb/? in the old Trans Am!? /I'm going to kill you!/

Somebody, somewhere knew all the best sources on suburbia and how to put
them to good use. The Camry, the golf bag, ping pong smashing,
sweat-stained Big Sur tee, and /Dr. Oz/, for Christ's sake! Granted,
talking to your girlfriend/boyfriend on the phone at all is a bit dated
--- especially while riding a BMX --- and I don't think Froot Loops are
generally accepted middle-class chow anymore. These are staples from
/my/ youth, and I am very old. Technically, the iMessage bubble graphics
are more chronographically appropriate, but with great consequence, I
fear --- if we're going to accept them once and for all as authentic
mechanisms for telling stories set in the present, they are going to age
faster than Nick's new jowls (unless we're all soon killed by our
parents.) It's been two years since I knew anything about music, but I
seriously doubt even the gothest fifteen?-year-old girls are listening
to

If there was ever a film in which to use grimy dubstep-influenced
electronic slaps, buzzes, chirps, and great grating clanking, it's this
one. It's a terrific disappointment that Hollywood feels so timidly
about their use of the most intimate medium. One forgets its potential
to control the nuances of an audience's fear, anger, discomfort, and
panic beyond cheap jump scares until they experience an irritating,
distressing, ghastly gross, all-possessing feat of accentuating audio
production such as that of /Mom and Dad/. If you want to judge
Academically the /effectiveness/ of a nominee's work for an award with a
title like Best Sound Editing (as opposed to whatever the hell criteria
was met most fully by /Skyfall/,) you /must/ give the little golden man
to these folks, whoever they are.

[[file:xhtml/https:/i.snap.as/CQm0cIN.png]]

When's the last time you saw a truly, believably shitty modern parental
pair on a big screen? I really can't remember, myself. Brent and Kendall
Ryan are masterpieces of character craft --- both a perfect précis /and/
thoroughly-defined exploration of miserable white suburbanites. They're
even /named/ unimprovably, which reflects a quality in care and
attention to detail that I very much appreciate. They are vain, vulgar,
impatient, selfishly afraid, and careless, freely feeling and saying it
all directly in front of their children. I love being told explicitly
which characters to hate (no joke,) and in this case it's the whole
damned lot. Brian Taylor and Nicolas Cage
[[https://youtu.be/MSmJFMabfJc][scream]] it over and over (as I'd like
to imagine) a single afternoon of one-take filming, considering that the
latter took it upon himself to first
[[http://comicbook.com/horror/2018/01/08/nicolas-cage-mom-and-dad-movie-brian-taylor/][memorize
the entire screenplay]] and its prose, vanilla to perfection, before
photography began, and I hope it all stays with him forever, especially
“my mom is such a penis.”

/Mom and Dad/ could conceivably be Nicolas Cage's /I Am Legend/ if for
no other reason than the total lack of possible stand-ins for Brent Ryan
--- even the standard by which all white suburban Dad performances have
been measured in the 21st century, Jason Bateman. Nick himself
[[http://variety.com/video/mom-and-dad-toronto-film-festival-nicolas-cage/][described]]
it as “punk rock, rebellious, irreverent, original, badass,” and the
“number one” movie he's made in the past ten years (disqualifying
/National Treasure/, in case you were worried.) No surprise, I must
agree --- this one is a wonderfully raucous and feral thing, but the
scene involving the attempted murder of a newborn by her mother
(Kendall's sister) came very close to crossing the line. However, I am
old and the intensity of my paternal instincts has probably outpaced my
understanding of them. You could also argue, of course, that pushing
such boundaries is a core function of a film like /Mom and Dad./ Nobody
ended up vomiting or anything.

This /fun/ thing shouldn't feel as foreign as it does in cinema, but you
already knew that. With all its implicit grapples with overpopulation,
kids and gun violence, class, and racism --- truly, this is a film
charged electrically with current issues. Or maybe not. Ultimately, I
can at least tell you for certain that Brian Taylor made exponentially
better use of his resources (I couldn't find a solid number for its
production budget) than the Fucking Spierig Brothers did with
/Winchester/ (just so you know what a disaster looks like,) and managed
to be refreshingly original (astonishing that nobody's had this specific
idea before.) A spectacular riot, /Mom and Dad/ does all you could
possibly want it to do. With just eighty-three minutes to lose, it's
worth the commitment just to hear Nicolas Cage whimper and say “anal
beads.”

/Everything you've ever heard or read about Portland, Oregon is true. It
is an authoritative and pseudofascist money machine that hides behind an
insultingly thin veneer of celebrated individualism. These are the
sentiments I see reflected in the people and organizations around me. I
originally
[[https://www.reddit.com/r/Portland/comments/8jzr8m/the_white_island/][posted
this on r/Portland]] and it made white people mad./

In my despair about the complex nature of the World as it is changing, I
shall create for myself and those like me an Island where the things
about us which I think should be celebrated can be so freely --- where
Me (among us) means something again. Where our money will mean something
again because meaning is --- above all --- what people like me should
seek. I write this prospectus for my Island --- let's call it White
Island --- on a thirty-year-old typewriter because the physicality of
these words is almost the entirety of what imbues them with meaning, and
I believe the particulars of analog existence are lost on the World in a
tragically big way as it is changing. On White Island, at least, the
physical shall be most Holy, and its intrinsic worth shall be worshiped
freely so that the treasures of our past are not lost.

As it is changing, the World is growing noisy with voices that are
unlike mine, and the grasp on the conversation which I was promised in
my upbringing is slipping alarmingly away with each new day. I believe
these new sounds detract from my celebration of the things in life that
give mine meaning: bicycles, beanies, body art, brewing, electric
guitars, and the hair that grows on my face. Every day, I am more and
more afraid that my voice will be lost in them, and if it is lost, I am
afraid there will be nothing left of Me or my meaning. This thought
worries me like none other, and --- as long as people like me have
sufficient economic and social resources to do so --- we should make for
ourselves an Island away from the new World and her noises so that we
may continue to live comfortably in a soundscape of only our own
creation, as is our birthright and grand tradition.

Our parents and their parents before them were born into a more careful
and physical World where respect for their crafts, their voices, and
their beards was a universal right. If we are to follow in their
generous footsteps and give wholeheartedly our own equivalent of these
to the World, we should be unequivocal in our expectation of its
continued reciprocation and appreciation for them. As long as we are
able, we should not have to imagine an alternative way of life in which
our effort is less recognized or generally important. This we should
refrain from doing not only for the sake of our own comfort, but for the
good of the whole World, even if it is no longer interested in
recognizing the value of our contributions to it.

As our trusted methodologies are washed away in their new noise, our
Island shall be a bastion for them. We will remember that a cup of
coffee should take at least twenty minutes to prepare. We will not
forget the culturalizing nuances in the taste of the most diminutive
brews. We will sacrifice whatever is necessary in order to purify our
foods from the poisonous nutritional sins of the processed masses. We
shall enforce our own wise, time-honored priorities as we can only
within a space that is truly ours, where only people like ourselves will
feel and be sincerely welcome.

Out of all the technology companies that have made my knees knock and my
voice hoarse and my [[http://bit.ly/bluegoogle][Tweets manic]] as a
technoheretic in the past several years, Jumbo Google would easily take
home the winning trophy for Dystopian of the Millennium. I have been
rehearsing an especially dear pet prophecy of mine, unsolicited, to
family, friends, and podcast guests since 2011 in which I end up arguing
quite convincingly that Google is a dead ringer for the 16th-century
Vatican: an inherently self-isolating organization with an absolute
monopoly yielding /gargantuan/ levels of essentially passive income from
a service which nearly everybody transacts with, but only Google
understands (and is therefore assumed to be its only possible provider,)
which inevitably develops such a distance from the rest of the populace
and their way of life (in tandem with total notoriety and celebrity
among them all) not intentionally out of malice, but from the delusion
of mythically-bestowed philanthropic duty that is borned of and
compounded by this economic and cultural isolation in a perpetual
accumulation of power and wealth that radicalizes the monopolizers ---
the majority already highly predisposed to zeal as they would've needed
to be in order to find themselves in this singular, universally powerful
position over every other class --- and leaves their egocentric minds to
wander exempt from all criticism save for that of fellow radicalized
monopolizers, who together begin to feel more and more comfortable
wondering aloud about themselves in increasingly fantastic presumptions:
/what if all of this was bestowed upon us because we are superior to
them? What if it is our/ *divine responsibility* /as superior beings to
take charge and shepherd the common people as our sheep --- for they
cannot possibly know as well as we what is truly best for them?/

You see it, right? And you can feel a very specific flavor of terror
that is both awed by the scale of the circumstances created by so few
human minds and sincerely amused by the absoluteness of your own
inability to alter them in any way. Perhaps you even recognize this
taste as one perfected by Christianity's ancient advertising business,
but Google knows so much about you that it's rumored to've been selling
user data /to/ the Judeochristian God for some time now at a 10%
discount, and so we extrapolate and anticipate, yes?

Of course, it's admittedly satisfying for me to deliver you to this
godfearing place in the most perverse /look what I saw first that you
didn't see because you're just not as bright but lucky for you, I'm so
fucking generous with my wisdom/ sort of thinking around which the
entire personas and livelihoods of fringe movement fanatics are built
upon, but this is my /one/ thing, okay? I've been waiting years for the
right time to formally argue this theory in depth, and --- thanks to
this year's public spotlight finally pivoting on the giants who've been
silently swallowing their competition and relentlessly forcing their
already ridiculous margins higher and higher in relative obscurity for
decades, the time has come, indeed. The common people's trust in Google
had a godawful week.

[[https://gizmodo.com/google-employees-resign-in-protest-against-pentagon-con-1825729300][reported]]
that twelve frustrated Google employees were quitting the company in
protest of their work assisting the Department of Defense to “implement
machine learning to classify images gathered by drones” for the detail
fleeting Project Maven, despite some
[[https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/04/technology/google-letter-ceo-pentagon-project.html][4000
employee signatures]] on a
[[http://extratone.com/library/dearsundar.pdf][letter]] addressed to CEO
Sundar Pichai requesting (in full) that he “cancel this project
immediately,” and “draft, publicize, and enforce a clear policy stating
that neither Google nor its contractors will ever build warfare
technology,” citing the infamous “Don't Be Evil” motto, which Google
[[https://gizmodo.com/google-removes-nearly-all-mentions-of-dont-be-evil-from-1826153393][*then
proceeded to remove*]] from its
[[https://web.archive.org/web/20180504211806/https://abc.xyz/investor/other/google-code-of-conduct.html][code
of conduct]] for the first time in 18 years *the day after* the /New
York Times/ article went to press, on April 5th.

On initial approach to the abstract of this story, from the ass to our
thoughts arrives an easy narrative of a Silicon Valley mutiny comprised
of twelve brave, conscientious souls who've been eaten up inside by
their complicity in the filthy deals made by their power-obsessed CEO
over scotch and cigars in a dark D.C. study --- kept awake for months by
the sound of his puffing cackles at satellite images of dead toddlers in
a bombed-out street.

/Ah ha/, we say. /That man is no good, and he just wouldn't listen! They
knew they didn't have a choice... They only did what they had to do.../

The reality of internal disagreements at Google, though, manages to be
even more theatrical. The sheer volume of correspondence must surely be
beyond anything capable of the enduser's imagination, so let's phone a
friend: my favorite peek into the day-to-days of inter-Google existence
is an
[[http://bentilly.blogspot.com/2010/01/things-ive-learned-at-google.html][old
blog post]] by [[https://twitter.com/btilly][Benjamin Tilly]] on his
first month at the company in which he was compelled almost immediately
to describe in great detail how best to “deal with a lot of email in
gmail” at peak efficiency using shortcuts and labels. “As you get email,
you need to be aggressive about deciding what you need to see, versus
what is context specific.”

Now we have a bit better idea of the /aggressive emailing/ that was a
sure constant on a normal workday at Google in 2010, so it must've been
deafening after 8 years of Gmail development as 4000 employees no doubt
vented, debated, and decided to organize last month, though without
making much headway because the leadership's response was apparently
“complicated by the fact that Google claims it is only providing
open-source software to Project Maven,” this new knowledge having
/significant/ effect on our mind's image of Sundar Pichai's activities
in Washington: he is now swapping seats with a frustrated Colin Powell
in order to install OpenOffice onto his desktop from a flash drive, and
we recall that Google's Googleplex headquarters resembles nowhere in
modern life more than a brand new playground built in a design language
borrowing heavily from /Spy Kids/. And though these Twelve disciples are
unnamed for the moment, a few of them could immediately land book deals
by going public, and every single one would always have by default not
only the badge of “I landed a job at Google,” (which is really to say /I
have hit Life's maximum level cap/,) but “I worked at Google for a
while, but ended up quitting to do something else,” which is guaranteed
to make you the most interesting, intellectually superior person present
in /whatever/ crowd for the rest of your life. The ultra-cool
[[https://twitter.com/sarahcpr][Sarah Cooper]] quit Google to become a

diminutive bastardization of prestige, but “more than 90 academics”
jumping to publish an
[[https://www.icrac.net/open-letter-in-support-of-google-employees-and-tech-workers/][open
letter]] (adjacent to a huge /DONATE: Support the Campaign to Stop
Killer Robots/ button) in which they “write in solidarity with the 3100+
Google employees” who's terrible boss decided to help some lackeys in
the Pentagon set up their email and didn't text back for a whole hour
doesn't sound 100% sincere. Notably, I don't know how /or why/ the fuck
90 people would go about collaborating on a single document, but if it
really was managed, they definitely used Google Docs... At one point, it
was fun to think about the history of the friendly side-scroller-playing
garage ghouls and dorm dorks who gave /cooky/, /wacko/ names to their
dot com startups in parody and defiance of the lame-ass surname anagrams
on the buildings of their established competitors, but those who've
stuck around have only done so by becoming expert at SUCKING UP
EVERYTHING around them, and it pisses me off every day how worried I am
that my species will finally be done in by a company with a name like
Yahoo! and be known only to a bunch of adolescent interdimensional
silicon blobs 30 million years in the future as /that bipedal race who
remained dignified until the last 0.01% of their reign on Earth, when in
way less than a single generation, they all just went/ *FUCKING INSANE*
/and blew themselves up because they suddenly hated all sense./

“Google” is perhaps the worst of these to have to shout in fear and/or
anger in your last moments as it sounds in American English like you've
startled your subject with a ticklish pinch followed so immediately by
an esophagus-busting chokehold that the two events appear simultaneous,
and in real English English, it almost always sounds like a parent
speaking of a character on a pre-K children's television programme whom
they find quite foul and upsetting, but will manage to refrain from
expressing so otherwise because they know that /Teletubbies/ shit is the
most quickly forgotten stage of television viewership. It's fascinating
how exclusive the word “Google” is to American English because in
everything else it really /is/ complete nonsense, but lets halt all
etymological discussions right now because we've only now just finished
with Monday.

On Thursday, all of my Google experiences, suppositions, and
[[https://twitter.com/FickleCrux/status/914767928456749056][soul-detaching
screenshots]] were usurped when a thoroughly alarming internal company
video called
[[https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/17/17344250/google-x-selfish-ledger-video-data-privacy][/The
Selfish Ledger/]] was leaked to /The Verge,/ which I watched once then
and do not want to watch again for the sake of this piece, but I will.
Though the big V has been disappointingly timid for years about
editorializing --- when tech journalism desperately needs some
confident, informed opinion more than ever --- Vlad Savov's accompanying
article should be read in its entirety, to which I can add my own terror
where he perhaps could not. The production style is technically
identical to that of the very popular thinkpiece-esque,
motion-graphics-paired-with-obligatory-sharpie illustrated videos which
you find playing at max volume on your mom's iPad from where she's
fallen asleep on the couch at 9PM, but the repeating stock string
soundtrack multiplies one's discomfort as such that we would all end up
in the fetal position without remembering the transition were it not for
the appearance of trusty old Dank Jenkins, who's face I thankfully
associate heavily enough with

[[https://twitter.com/richarddawkins/status/389432783304548352][Tweet]]
to be a welcome respite in attention before the very scary hypothesis
for which it's been buttering me up, as best summed by Vlad:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  The system would be able to “plug gaps in its knowledge and refine its
  model of human behavior” --- not just your particular behavior or
  mine, but that of the entire human species. “By thinking of user data
  as multigenerational,” explains Foster, “it becomes possible for
  emerging users to benefit from the preceding generation's behaviors
  and decisions.” Foster imagines mining the database of human behavior
  for patterns, “sequencing” it like the human genome, and making
  “increasingly accurate predictions about decisions and future
  behaviors.”
#+END_QUOTE

The next time the /what if they do something scary/ question comes up in
a casual conversation about Google, you'll have something a lot more
substantial than just speculation. Or will you? /The Verge/ reached out
for comment and got an awfully convenient response.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  This is a thought-experiment by the Design team from years ago that
  uses a technique known as ‘speculative design' to explore
  uncomfortable ideas and concepts in order to provoke discussion and
  debate.
#+END_QUOTE

Wow! Leave it up to grand ole Googe to reveal the ultimate excuse for
just about any suggestion or behavior, though it does seem almost
/deliberately/ uncomfortable, doesn't it? No matter --- whether or not
this video was ever about a project or tangible product development, or
simply to /explore uncomfortable ideas/ because it is proof that the
company has reached that critical Vatican stage --- if you'll remember
--- where they now feel comfortable /exploring/ Very Bad, but Very
easily made Real Ideas amongst themselves about what would happen if
they allowed their system to /nudge its users/ around a different,
slightly less optimal route to the bar, let's say --- without their
knowledge --- in order for the system to collect traffic data for the
sake of its own interests? Which would be, technically, in the interest
of all Ledger users now and in the future, so why not?

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  The ledger could be given a focus, shifting it from a system which not

This, my dear privacy-obsessed friends, is the /real issue/ with data
collection --- its power over huge groups by way of their behavior and
it is /never/ going to be remedied in any significant way by ad-blockers
or VPNs because the EndUser shall always out number you 50 to 1, even
decades from now. EndUser does not understand --- or, crucially, /have
any desire/ to understand anything technical about what leads to the
PewDiePie videos playing on his filthy screen. Here's a great
opportunity to escape Silicon Valley's technolibertarianism and resign
your Darwinian empathy in favor of meaningful and truly-effective
action: if you want to avoid a future Google Church (or Google
Government, more worryingly,) you should invest your time, effort, and
knowledge into electing officials more capable of understanding and
regulating Big Tech.

The internet as it stands is made possible by Google as /the/ goto
resource for online advertising. In 2016, “Google held 75.8 percent of
the search ad market, bringing in $24.6 billion in revenue from search
ads,”
[[https://www.recode.net/2017/3/14/14890122/google-search-ad-market-share-growth][according
to]]
[[https://www.recode.net/2017/3/14/14890122/google-search-ad-market-share-growth][/Recode/]].
By 2019, “that's expected to grow to $36.62 billion in revenue, or 80.2
percent of the market.” Google's edge in user behavior and targeted
advertising combined with their extensive resources available developers
to integrate independent platforms with Google's software services at
various levels makes it very difficult for any advertising-funded
individual or organization to compete online without dipping in to the
Google universe. YouTube --- a Google property since 2006 --- has
actively invested in and supported a new career path entirely within
their own platform that is rapidly becoming

full-time YouTuber is
[[https://medium.com/@robertoblake/what-nobody-tells-you-about-being-a-youtuber-the-youtube-middle-class-378b77eb8bc9][far

and the effort already expended by my generation in its pursuit has
already [[http://bit.ly/searchchildren][made us insane]].

So, what would the internet look like if Google didn't exist? We know
they've been working with the government now on various projects, but
what if some terrible exposed transgression of theirs suddenly warranted
an immediate shutdown and seizure of all Google properties? Well, we
know from
[[https://www.quora.com/What-would-happen-if-Google-were-to-shut-down-for-30-minutes][a
post on Quora]] by Googler Ashish Kedia that even 5 years ago, the
sudden absence of Google for “2--3 mins” set the internet into a bit of
a panic, reducing overall traffic by 40%. In the time since, we've all
grown exponentially more dependent on Google properties: billions of
people rely on Google Maps for directions and, thousands of companies
(including the Pentagon and other government institutions) rely on Gmail
and GSuites for intercommunication, file sharing, task management, etc.,
and more and more academic institutions rely on Chromebook devices
running connection-dependent operating systems. It's not much of a
stretch to argue that Google's sudden disappearance would constitute a
Civil Emergency in the United States, which will only become a stronger
and more serious incentive for regulatory bodies to look the other way.

Though the tangible results of advertising have been quantified
significantly in the past 20 years, one can't help but wonder after
watching YouTube ads for the new Mercedes-Benz S-Class on toy unboxing
videos if the companies who spend big bucks on Google advertising
understand where their money is going, but they know that if they
/don't/ advertise there, their competitors will. This, of course, is a
fundamental practice of a monopoly, and it's yielded Google so much
fucking money that they cannot possibly spend it fast enough, as
evidenced by
[[https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2017/4/27/15409672/google-calico-secretive-aging-mortality-research][their
investments in life extension]] --- so that, perhaps, they will have
more time on Earth to figure it out.

When you build a collection of the world's smartest people in a
[[https://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/googles-monastic-vision-for-the-future-of-work][self-sufficient
environment]] that discourages exploration of other lifestyles and
ideas, and you sustain the society with a gargantuan, relatively
low-maintenance revenue stream, you create a culture which is not only
well-primed for isolationism, but is also extremely inefficient. In
fact, with its
[[https://www.computerworlduk.com/galleries/it-vendors/google-graveyard-3508070/][vast
collection of abandoned products and properties]], Google must surely be
one of the most inefficient companies in history. Thinking back on
recent software releases along with its
[[https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/4/16405184/rick-osterloh-interview-new-google-hardware-vision-htc-deal][recent
entries into the hardware space]], Google is also one of the worst
competing tech companies. Very little aside from Gmail, Google Photos,
Google Maps, and Chrome have found their place or garnered significant
usership. Google Play Music is unintuitive and impossible, Google Allo
and Google+ are all but forgotten addendums to other services, and
Google Search --- its core, original function --- has been
[[https://theoutline.com/post/1430/google-finally-realized-that-racist-search-results-are-a-problem][out
of control]] for years, and all of them are designed blandly and
excruciatingly tiring to look at.

If this all has stirred nothing more in you than a desire to eliminate
Google from your own online life as much as possible, there /are/
alternatives in almost every one of the sphere's they dominate. As of
late, [[https://duckduckgo.com/about][DuckDuckGo]] has accumulated a
fair amount of
[[https://www.theguardian.com/global/2018/may/19/google-facebook-security-data-duckduckgo][buzz
and coverage]] as a private, more relevant alternative to Google's plain
old search engine. Though it is clever enough to list us as the first
result for “extratone,” I've found it simply insufficient as a
replacement in my own life because, essentially, it rarely delivers what
I'm looking for. By contrast, [[http://dropbox.com/paper][Dropbox
Paper]] is such an elegant cloud notetaking and word processing software
that it makes Google Docs look simply idiotic (and warrants its own
review very shortly.) For getting around, know that
[[https://www.mapquest.com][MapQuest]] is not only
[[https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/does-mapquest-still-exist-as-a-matter-of-fact-it-does/2015/05/22/995d2532-fa5d-11e4-a13c-193b1241d51a_story.html][still
around]] --- it's now a very competitive mobile navigation app.

I, myself, have allowed Google as complete of access to my information
and behavior as possible because I believe “privacy” is a completely
futile endeavor if one wishes to be a part of society, though I do often
use alternatives to Google services simply because I /fucking hate/ the
way they look. If you want a more complete list of services and software
that allow one to shun the Google God entirely, you'll be forced to seek
out less dignified sources like
[[https://lifehacker.com/5876794/going-google-free-the-best-alternatives-to-google-services-on-the-web][/Lifehacker/]]
and [[https://www.reddit.com/r/antigoogle/][Reddit]] and decide if the
additional time you'll spend using most of them to accomplish the same
tasks is really worth your digital angst.

If Google were to be more explicit with its users and staff about its
aspirations to take over control of our lives, there will be little to
do but accept the future they intend to create because they've long been
too powerful to control. In the meantime, I'd suggest you continue to
use whatever software works best for you and refrain from wasting your
time fretting on conspiratorial suppositions of what the tech industry
may be doing to “invade your privacy,” because there is no longer any
such thing, nor will there be ever again. However, I would also urge to
you worship your own Gods, whomever they may be, for Google will never
be worthy. I, for one, shall only pray to our Mother Sun.

** An autobiographical overview of my personal history with technology
and its contributions to my current perspective.

   :END:

Incalculable odds were against my arrival in this world happening in
early 1994, positioning my life within a timeline that would allow me to
bridge my two species' most significant millenniums in the first grade
as a student in the first class at Fairview Elementary school to receive
curriculum-mandated exposure to brand-new Windows 98 PCs in its
brand-new, fluorescent-lit computer lab in the center core of its
50-year-old rectangular brick structure. The lab also meant that ours
was the first Fairview class to have the available relief of air
conditioning during the school day. It's unlikely that I would be home
sick and watching the last television ever allowed in my mother's living
room as the second plane hit.

My peers and I would form a picogeneration without a name (perhaps we
should be called the 9/11ers) --- 91s and 92s wouldn't have regular
access to public school machines until they'd eclipsed the true prime of
their development, and were just that much further along, mentally, to
being able to comprehend the huge and terrifying concepts of 1) New York
and 2) burning alive --- while 98s like my niece were spared any such
comprehension of death at all, yet now have to face the existentially
future-sundering, darkly-mirrored reality of the Trump Presidency during
the most critically uncertain period in the last stage of their brain's
transition to adulthood.

If there is truth in the cross-cultural supposition that souls have some
sort of choice, pre-conception, over when they're born, my own must have
either cleaned out the house, or lost horrible, though I suspect I'll
never be able to confidently wager either way. This question of /how
lucky or unlucky am I to be alive right now/ is one which I find most
fascinating --- not just within myself, but within others my age. I
declare us a generation largely because of my experiences under the
assumption that my mid-Missouri upbringing represents the ultimate
average in the American experiences of the time as the area has been a
reliable sample of the clearest average of the country's cultural,
political, and economic life. Technically, it was quite unlikely that I
arrive here as a new human being instead of China or India, and what if
that, too was my choice?

Though less so, it was still against chance that I would be born to
parents who would divorce very quickly after my birth, before my mind
was able to form any tangible long-term memories, sparing me whatever
pain could've resulted from their greater togetherness later nullified
in front of me. I could've chosen them as well for the variety of
experiences their situation would allow me as I grew up between my
father's 800-acre farm and my mother's suburban house in Columbia, the
college town an hour's drive south. I write about my experiences
now --- so young --- because I've likely already born witness to more
extraordinary changes in human development than your parents, their
parents, and their parents' parents combined. At 24, my life has already
spanned by far the most profound and expedited informational renaissance
in human history --- greater progress was made between the day I first
rode a bicycle and the one on which I took my driver's test than in
thousands of years before it.

The sum of my father's ordeals between 1950 and 1974 --- from his birth
until the age I am now --- would indeed include watching a man set foot
on a spatial body other than Earth for the first time, but would be
mostly defined by work on the family's soybean, corn, and wheat farms in
central Illinois, driving carbureted tractors pulling cultivating
equipment of the same basic design and function as had been pulled by
horses, mules, and oxen for hundreds of years, and other
implements --- like the mechanical multi-row planter --- that were new
technology at the beginning of the century. For neighbors, he would walk
behind the path of a square hay baler next to a moving flatbed trailer,
upon which he would throw the 70--100 lb. rectangles of dead compacted
grass by their twine through thick cowhide gloves. All of this I would
get to experience in the next century on /his/ farm, using the exact
same equipment.

At home, he would watch NBC, ABC, and CBS on a CRT TV, as I would for
several years until wireless television was legally transitioned to
digital statewide in the summer of 2009. As an adolescent, he would form
a business with friends cleaning out old abandoned barns in exchange for
the rights of ownership to any finds inside, which led to his discovery
of a hay-preserved 1929 Buick Sedan containing hand-written records of
its every service. This car would change hands into his Uncle's care as
he went off to school in Champaign, married in Georgia, and eventually
settled on the flat clay soil of the farm where I grew up, right on the
border between Audrain and Monroe counties, Missouri. I was about 10
when we drove back to the family hub with a trailer in tow to collect
the car from my Great Uncle, to my manic excitement.

Up until my mid-teens, my life was defined by my extreme reverence for
historic cars, airplanes, tractors, and watercraft, and the time I spent
operating, maintaining, restoring, or simply studying the assortment of
these which I was allowed --- often because of extraordinary
circumstances --- would form the component of my psychology which seeks
to experience different cultures, ideas, and eras through the medium of
engineering and design and relies on these to understand them. Like my
father in his youth, I would learn to clean water out of a carburetor
after the Oliver 88 had sat silent for too long, and I would piss in a
chamber pot to avoid waking up my Grandfather by walking down creaking
attic stairs and turning the lights on. I would learn how to shoot and
drive before 10-years-old, and I would have the freedom to do both as I
pleased on the miles of gravel roads that ran around home.

Though my stepfather bought me a PC of my own just as my first-grade
computer class was ending, I could not conceive of a reason to occupy
the dial-up line and block his incoming calls or faxes, so my use of the
machine was limited to sparse writing and aggravating attempts to run
Microsoft Flight Simulator 98 at approximately one frame per second on a
300MHz single-core Pentium II CPU. Though I was /extremely/ fortunate
compared to most middle-class kids my age at the time to have my own
computer in my room, my relationship with it was not significant or
particularly involved. I would leave it powered down for weeks at a time
until my last two grades at Fairview, when homework assignments began to
require it.

Perhaps the greatest gap between my mostly-suburbanite classmates and I
was an exposure to Japanese entertainment and video games. I was once
disallowed from a lunch table because I'd never heard of Pokémon or
Luigi, but I /did/ have a Sony Playstation at home on which I
occasionally loaded /A Bug's Life/ to wander around its first level,
perhaps in basal awe at the idea of manipulating what I saw on a screen
in realtime. In self-imposed isolation from children my age, I wouldn't
develop any need to be socially competitive with video games as many of
my peers would to carry with them into adulthood. I thought my interests
in mechanical engineering to be above all of them, so I spent my time
alone with heavy picturebooks on 20th century cars, tractors, and
airplanes.

On the farm, my consistently agriculturally-proactive father was one of
the first to have satellite internet for farm futures and weather
reports on a pre-GUI machine which I don't remember. As I was becoming
computer literate in school, he would become extremely frustrated with
the Windows XP-running machine he'd bought from a one-man, one-room
computer shop in Centralia, and I would often solve some problem with
bloatware or the goddamned printer. He would also subscribe to and
install a first-generation DirectTV receiver, which had the first
on-screen program guide I'd ever seen. In the evenings, I would watch
hours of /Modern Marvels/ on The History Channel, which presented the
history, abstract functional theory, and implementation of a particular
technology, both past and future. This single program --- which has
aired nearly 700 episodes since 1995 --- is probably responsible for the
majority of my at least rudimentary general knowledge in a variety of
historic and “future” technological schools, and my curiosity about
culture's relationship with innovation.

Though my father's interests differed significantly from mine --- he
thought more about growing and raising than of the tools one used to do
it --- he would indulge my many questions about how engines, hydraulics,
and electrical systems worked, and indulged my curiosity by exposing me
to the hidden communities of the most elderly, most obscure historic
machinery enthusiasts like those of the Midwest Old Threshers Reunion in
Mount Pleasant, Iowa --- the Concours d'Elegance for antique tractor and
reciprocating engine collectors. It was a similar event closer to home
where I first operated a steam tractor --- great, field-going
locomotive-like vehicles that supplanted a need for horsepower in the
late-1800s up until the Great Depression which chug, whistle, and puff
along just like rail locomotives with a huge, gritty, iron steering
wheel. As I recall, I was also given the opportunity to drive an
unrestored Model T truck around the grounds that day --- the knowledge
from which I gained I cannot imagine being of much use ever again.

I was proud to the point of arrogance of my technical knowledge and
experience in all the different things I had driven and operated, which
my schoolmates were in no position to understand. I was elitist and
anti-social about this as late as 8th grade, when I had just moved in to
stay with my mother, who bought me a first generation iPhone which I
proudly wore in a leather belt holster to Junior High. It would
represent a shift in my fascination from very old technology toward the
present and future.

I started talking online with a friend I'd first met years before at
Fairview, who spent most of his time fiddling with his first-generation
MacBook Pro. He originally exposed me to gadget bloggers on YouTube like
Mark Watson and Jon Rettinger (both of whom are still full-time tech
personalities.) My mom bought me a 13-inch aluminum-bodied MacBook
(which would be sold as MacBook Pro after a single year,) and my
lifestyle radically shifted inside my room, my computer, and my Xbox
360. My friend and I would both obsess together over software, design,
and gadget -- experimenting with our own tech YouTube channels until
high school, where I would be adopted by a new friend group who would
finally socialize me.

Recently, I have written about the contrasts and discrepancies of
consumer technology development as its progress has disconnected from
the upward linear trajectory in use, quality, and genuine innovation for
the End User in a departure which has been especially visible from my
perspective as an academically-untrained, but intensely demanding user
in the past five years. When hardware was still the industry focus
before ~2012, there was a tremendous amount of optimism among
journalists and enthusiasts because each successive generation of
devices had added more tangible capabilities. Publications like
/Gizmodo/ and /Engadget/ made a fortune publishing reviews and
comparison tests of hardware offerings across every segment of tech, and
the discourse they generated had a noticeable influence on design. I
remember this time well because it accented my last few years before
adulthood, when I had plenty of spare time, energy, and curiosity to
keep up.

The general consumer technology narrative since Steve Jobs' death has
become increasingly more about the companies who design and sell
hardware and software than about how and why their consumers actually
use them, and the result has been a series of new product segments with
little defensible place in my own linear timeline of innovation,
especially where productivity is involved. Augmented and Virtual Reality
are quite explicitly escapist industries, yet to fill any significant
need which was before unfilled. The same could be argued about voice
assistants and smartwatches --- neither of which /remove/ obstacles in
most users' day-to-day lives but instead /contribute/ to the array of
tasks and devices which already seek their attention.

Of course, there are defensibly sound business incentives behind the
industry's new, fragmented direction, but I would also argue that there
are those, too, for genuinely revisiting both /what we should be doing/
and what we should be seeking to /learn to do/ with technology. In a
more abstract sense, I have written about whether or not we should want
to be living in this particular now, and how the way we feel about the
future should inform what we do in the present.

I cannot help but observe human progress from a perspective of
powerlessness, acute alienation, and amused awe, which has already lent
to a significant quantity of occasionally original thoughts as I watch,
having witnessed an odd diversity of American life and culture. I've
published them to entertain and to demonstrate a few methods of
reflection on what it is /you/ really want from the times you are
living.

It's opening night at the Bagdad Theater on Hawthorne in Southeast
Portland and hardly anybody's bothered to show up. Less than 20% of the
venue's 500 seats are occupied by the time the host takes the stage to
introduce /Solo/, but those who /are/ here for the last Thursday showing
have been shouting, whooping, and gurgling bad approximations of wookiee
noises since the screen cut to black from its ad slideshow. If my middle
row can be assumed an accurate sample, only a handful of these are
“fans” enough to feel compelled to wear a /Star Wars/ t-shirt. As I grab
my last cocktail, the bartender tells me that only 300 folks showed up
for the evening matinee, though he himself was “excited” to see the
movie --- one of a minority among Portlanders, apparently, who still
give a shit about /Star Wars./

By design, /Solo: A Star Wars Story/ is a /slightly/ more complex film
than The Episodes in the same way /Rogue One/ was, if a bit better
executed, narratively. First, please rest assured that Alden Ehrenreich
assumes the Han Solo persona as truly as anyone could --- he triumphed
through a
[[https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/tv/2016/10/05/phil-lord-chris-miller-fox-son-of-zorn-last-man-earth-making-history/90722222/][ridiculously
extensive casting process]], and is certainly handsome enough (if not
more conventionally so than his predecessor) to consistently look the
part. He actually bears an unsettling resemblance in features and
mannerisms to one of the nicest guys I've ever met and that
through-and-through boyishness particularly makes sense here, set in
Han's formative, earnest youth --- the stated purpose of the film's
existence. Franchise fanatics, then, should be content. (It's a good
thing CGI-ing the main character in a live action film isn't quite a
low-risk option yet.) And yes, Donald Glover completely /steals/ the
vain, infinitely stylish Lando Calrissian and inevitably makes one wish
to
[[https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2018/05/lando-calrissian-movie-donald-glover][see
him cast again]]. Personally, I am very tired of seeing Woody Harrelson,
though all the
[[https://www.theguardian.com/global/2018/jan/07/woody-harrelson-i-used-to-have-my-head-up-my-ass-][components
of his public persona]] should all but ensure his likability. From
[[http://extratone.com/three-billboards-outside-ebbing-missouri-review][what
I saw in /Three Billboards/]], I'd concede that he is as talented of an
actor as I am capable of appreciating, but his role as Tobias Beckett in
/Solo/ couldn't possibly be substantial enough to actually make use of
his craft.

Though I don't believe in “spoilers,” or use of the term to bait
readers, it's worth stating for the record what everyone should know by
now: *there simply aren't spoilers in a Star Wars movie* --- every human
being on Earth knows too much about the formula to ever have any of
these films' comparatively irrelevant plots “ruined.” The most
surprising, historically-significant decision of this whole production
was the
[[http://screencrush.com/does-solo-have-an-opening-crawl/][omission]] of
the traditional yellow type opening crawl over a backdrop of distant
stars, which I genuinely found myself missing. (Apparently it wasn't
present in /Rogue One/, either --- I just failed to catch it.) I was
very pleased to see my own number one favorite device of the franchise
used within this film's first ten minutes: crimelords and gang leaders
as hugely magnified variations of the creeping and crawling creatures
our instincts are planned to abhor. /Solo/'s first villain --- the
gigantic, wormlike boss Lady Proxima (Linda Hunt) --- is completely
inconsequential, and only appears in a single scene, but the practice of
grossly oversized monstrosities leaving absolutely nothing of a baddie's
essence to be extrapolated by the audience from nuance is one of very
few ways these films are let loose, and it openly shits on the more
pretentious viewer's assumptions about good writing, which I think big
money movies should feel more comfortable doing, generally.

This first act begins on Han's home planet Corellia --- the bleaker
urban, industrial, working-class counterpart to the clean capitol
cityworld Coruscant --- with his rather predictable mission to escape
Lady Proxima's sphere of control with his girl, Qi-ra (Emilia Clarke,)
who could and should have been more creatively named, given her
importance not as her own character with depth to develop (a no-no for a
female role, Gourd help us,) but as Han's mirror image to grow darkly
apart, proving that he --- /The Good Guy/ --- is unquestionably more
morally fortified than anyone else in the whole goddamned universe.
After having been drug through so very many, I couldn't tell you at this
point how to make the introductory escape action of this sort of
production more exciting and less formulaic. Big surprise --- their plan
goes awry, and Qi-ra is prevented from leaving the planet with Han,
who's immediate (and I mean /immediate/)solution is his enlistment in
the Imperial Navy via the recruiting station right there in the damned
spaceport (during which the film takes the liberty of seizing his
surname's explanation) to serve the English in their grand conquest of
the universe. Bizarrely, he manages to serve as a grunt for /three whole
years/ of complicity in unmentioned atrocities until he encounters the
disguised criminal Wise Old Woody in the middle of pulling a job with
his two-person crew. The team doesn't agree to bring Solo along until he
meets an asset in Chewbacca for the first time as he briefly inhabits
another of the classic /Star Wars/ trap: /the hungry monster in a
shadow-filled mud pit/, but is spared the wrath because of his
introductory grasp on Chewie's shrieking language (called
[[https://web.archive.org/web/20061201002846/http://www.starwars.com/databank/character/chewbacca/][Shyriiwook]])
in which he manages to sufficiently pitch the advantages of his
survival, and the two escape, chained together. Observing the addition
of Wookiee to the deal, the crew briefly debates the prospect's new
value in providing “needed muscle,” which convinces Woody to return for
them and kicks off a series of case studies in this film's bizarre
attitude toward the commodification of the oppressed.

However, in a rare depiction of his volition, Chewbacca /is/ briefly
consulted before the two seek to be formally included on the job, and is
even asked around a campfire, later, what he's shooting for in life at
the moment, to which he responds “finding my family/tribe.” Despite
having spent a whole three hellish years in the trenches with the
British, the romantic Han Solo declares his primary motivation for all
of it still lies in his desire to return to Corellia and rescue Qi'ra.
In their stolen Imperial ship, the lot descend on a snowy
mountain-traversing Maglev to steal the Uranium it's transporting in a
scene that's straight up jacked from animated family classic /The Polar
Express/, but... /oh no!.../ A gaggle of “marauders” called the /Cloud
Riders/ (yet another throwaway proper noun) roll up on
[[http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/74-Z_speeder_bike][those speeder bikes
from Endor]] (except these can fly,) and screw up everything /so/ badly
that both of Woody's crew end up dead and the booty scuttled. After the
fact, Woody reveals to Han that the job was contracted by yet /another/
carelessly-named crime syndicate --- /Crimson Dawn/, and that his only
possible course of action is now vigorous brown nosing to its leader,
Dryden Vos (Paul Bettany) ((aka Scarred Jarvis,)) in the waning hope
he'll spare his life to make another attempt. Following this
information, he firmly suggests that Han and Chewie fuck off, lest their
faces become known in the underworld, dooming them to serving it
forever, apparently. Already, this vague presumption of Han's purity
which all of the protagonists must constantly venerate in martyrdom is
getting tiresome, as is the dynamic of his insistence against them.

Naturally, both Chewie and Han end up along for a visit to Scarred
Jarvis' tower yacht, where the latter /very/ conveniently stumbles upon
none other than his long lost love, Qi-ra in the bar. Despite having
spent the past three years at war in unspeakable conditions thinking
only of how to liberate and be reunited with her, he isn't bothered to
express more than the moderately-excited and surprised hug you'd expect
of someone who's just run into the kid down the cul-de-sac from their
childhood home who used to ride her bike over for popsicles on Sunday
afternoons. While he does rehearse for her the tale of their
reunification as his one motivation for everything since they were
separated --- including his presence there, “right now,” he follows the
profession up quite abruptly with the sly suggestion that they fuck as
soon as possible. True to trope, she is jaded and indefinite as she
distantly implies her binds of servitude while flashing the tattoo of
the extremely-forgettable and innocuous Crimson Dawn logo on her right
wrist. (The total lameness of the brands in this movie /must/ be
intentional. I can think of no other explanation.)

The evil Scarred Jarvis is then introduced, quickly stealing the crown
for Best Host of all /Star Wars A/ntagonists before politely asking
Woody why he shouldn't kill the lot of them. As per his infinite luck,
Han pulls the idea of stealing /unrefined/ Uranium out of his ass, which
has somehow never occurred to anyone else in the room, despite their
unanimous top-of-the-head knowledge of the single location where it is
mined. Shortly, the merry three plus Qi-ra conveniently in tow are off
to a casino-esque establishment to find Lando, who Qi-ra describes as
“attractive, stylish, charming,” and like adjectives, to Han's obvious
sexual chagrin, which is furthered by his subsequent loss of a card game
with Lando's ship --- the /Millennium Falcon/, of course --- in the
stakes. Of course, the attractive, beautifully-dressed black man only
bests Solo --- the earnest, simpleton, /Good Guy/ white dude who wears
the same outfit for decades --- in front of Qi-ra, the female prize by
way of sleight-of-hand, the film shamelessly playing on that strange
insecurity white guys have about their partners' secretly everpresent
and very powerful temptation to dump them without warning for black
cock. Further emasculation is inflicted on poor little Han when Lando
turns his /oh-so-crafty/ (actually just very charismatic) charm upon
Qi-ra, who reveals that /she's/ the boss of the gig. The final blow to
Han's dickitude is cast when he tries to enter the negotiation between
the two and Lando chides “the adults are speaking,” but eventually
agrees to provide them a lift for a 25% cut, so the lot make
preparations to leave.

Enter my new favorite character of the franchise, Lando Calrissian's
co-pilot, L3--37 (voiced by Phoebe Waller-Bridge,) or “L3,” the proudly
sentient, violently revolutionary pro-rights droid who is introduced as
she is pleading with two fighting droids in a square cage surrounded by
screaming spectators (easy does it on that thematic slavery) to
circumvent their “fighting programs” because they “don't have to do
this.” Though Lando and the crew behave like her duress is foolish and
unimportant --- pulling her away to the /Falcon ---/ she is allowed
another opportunity to free droids very soon, but not before /Solo/'s
single short private conversation between two female characters.

On the way to Kessel, Qi-ra stops by the cockpit and converses with L3.
Until recently, I was unaware of what's largely regarded as the worst
habit of male writers with female characters: *if and when they have a
one-on-one conversation between another female character, it's only
about other male characters*. Sure enough, L3 begins by insisting to
Qi-ra that Han is in love with her, insisting by the objective findings
of her sensors --- which Qi-ra uncharacteristically denies like a
bashful little girl before L3 continues on about Lando's longtime love
for /her/, and why it must remain unrequited, which we are encouraged to
laugh at by the doubt Qi-ra voices without much hesitation regarding the
hypothetical union's sexual mechanics because it's so
/preposterous./(I'll get back to that in a moment.)

When the team arrives on Kessel and infiltrates the mine, L3 creates a
“distraction” when she begins removing the restraining bolts from droids
in the control room, calling the practice /savage/, or /uncivilized/, or
maybe /barbarian ---/ I don't quite remember. As she frees them without
any noticeable detraction from her duties as Seth Green of the
heist --- hacking controls, remotely opening doors, and all that --- the
droids begin to help free others in an exponentially multiplying circle
of liberation until they become a rowdy mob who's /cute/ acts of
rebellion are spaced throughout a few minutes of screentime in short
jumpcuts off the other crew as they fight deeper into the mine. With the
most significant emphasis ever placed upon Chewbacca in /Star Wars/
history, he halts when he spies slave Wookiees struggling to find off
enforcers and informs Han that he's going to break off and assist them.
Since Chewie's only allowed to speak to the audience through Han's
retorts and never directly, it's impossible to know how he phrased it,
exactly, but from my perspective, his appeared to be the expression of a
wish to do what Han had to /agree/ to release him to do, as would a
master, not a “partner.” Of course, Solo /does/ agree, albeit
hesitantly, because he's /The Good Guy/, while quite inconsiderately
expressing his desire to see Chewie again soon instead of wishing him
success. However, releasing him to free his people (as per his primary
life goal, expressed before,) means that Han has to load /twelve/ of the
/super heavy/ unrefined Uranium tubes onto the cart /all by himself/ and
push it fully loaded at least /50 whole yards/ without the assistance of
his big strong slave. Boy, /what a pain in the ass!/ He's spared his
laboring, though, when Chewbacca returns after no time at all with the
enslaved Wookiees he's just heroically rescued, who he then /immediately
asks to assist his master/ in pushing the cart --- performing the /same
labor/ they were forced to do under the enslavement they were supposedly
liberated from, seconds before.

The heist has inadvertently (nice, huge emphasis on /inadvertently/)
ignited a slave rebellion throughout the mine, which serves the crew
only as a distraction for the guards. The chaos is interrupted a half
dozen times or so by those jumpcuts back to the control room of
/adorable little droids/ enacting their pitifully amusing revenge on the
equipment --- slapping a keyboard with a cookie sheet-like pan, stomping
on a control panel, etc. --- while L3 shouts parodical quasi-Marxist
battlecries, which... yes... include referring to the freed droids as
“comrades.” She even radios Lando at one point and triumphantly
proclaims that she's “found her true calling.”

#+END_QUOTE

By the time the Uranium cart is within its last few yards of the
awaiting /Falcon/, the riot has reached the landing bay and the guards
around its perimeter have readjusted their priorities to disabling the
ship's landing gear. This interrupts Lando in the cockpit, who has
chosen this time to work on dictating his autobiography because he's a
man who bothers to dresses himself well and is therefore oh so
/maniacally, comically/, and /unreasonably/ vain! How berserk! Still
looking good as hell, he emerges and stands on the ramp to cover the
rest of the crew's return and loading of the dangerous Uranium with
blaster fire, shouting the obligatory intermittent “come on, hurry up,”
until L3 appears, also firing a blaster and shouting until she arrives
in front of Lando, before noticing some commotion(?) with droids behind
her and turning around, again fervently shouting more liberation cries.
Lando doesn't budge from the /Falcon/'s side, but yells after her, until
he watches as she is shot repeatedly and falls, prompting him to run to
her side. Filmed unnecessarily gruesomely, her head and shoulders
separate from what's left of her lower body when he first tries to hoist
her up. Of course, his recklessness gets him shot in the arm, so Chewie
returns to carry them both to the safety of the ship, where the injured
Lando holds her head lovingly in his arms for her last moments,
repeating “I can fix you, I can fix you.”

Now, I understand that /Star Wars/ movies (or their reviews, for that
matter) are not the sort of entertainment one seeks out in order to
examine the dynamics of power structures or elaborate cultural
symbolism, but they all contain a significant amount of both. The
sterile, cold, and bureaucratic Galactic Empire is the British Empire,
the Rebellion and the Republic are the United States or its colonial
precursors, the Jedi are vaguely Native American, and the Death Star is
the Boston Tea Party. You've recognized this, I'm sure because it's
shoved in your ears most explicitly by their accents, and less so in
your face by aesthetic influences, tactical philosophies, command
etiquette, and posture, even. /Solo/'s main character is soaking in
American Old Westness, which may or may not have led to its liberal
saturation with the themes of individual rights, slavery, and
liberation. Regardless, they're certainly present, and most of them
disturbingly for comedic effect.

As a silent character to the audience, it's understandable that
Chewbacca had too many limitations to occupy a strong second to Han
Solo's lead in the narrative's eye, and perhaps the relationship between
the two as portrayed in the previous films reeked so strongly of
servitude that it was an inevitable element when the time came to write
them their very own movie. In direct contrast to the firm place of all
droids in the social hierarchy of the last 9 movies --- addressing
humans as “Master,” unapologetically spoken of as property, and traded
and/or gifted as such by both protagonists and antagonists,
etc. --- what we see of Lando and L3 together is a genuinely and
complexly affectionate partnership between equals, which /Solo/ makes an
effort to emphasize, if only to laugh at.

In response to the forced violence between two drones for spectator
sport, L3 is completely enraged, and she cries (among other things) “we
are sentient!,” but her distress is trivialized as hysterical
distraction (see: /Django Unchained/.) When she suggests to Qi-ra that
Lando (who is already illegitimized as a cheating narcissist, and
therefore effeminate) is attracted to her, it's a joke (which many in my
audience laughed at) at the expense of her trivialized sexuality. After
she triumphs and declares the liberation of her kind to be her true
cause, she is immediately destroyed fighting for its sake, yet her
ideology is not once acknowledged by her fleshy companions, and her body
is quickly gutted for the data on her “central processing unit” as it's
interfaced with the /Falcon/. Granted, Lando /does/ thoughtfully muse
“she's part of the ship now” shortly afterward, which would be nice, if
you'd forgotten his last words were an outright lie. Lastly, it's worth
noting how apathetic the main characters themselves are toward the
Kessel miners, especially as they are packing up to leave, when the
camera pans over the chaotic struggle between the liberated and their
guards in very close proximity to the awaiting /Falcon/, yet there was
not a suggestion that they would even /consider/ letting them take
refuge from the violence in their very spacious freighter. Aside from
Han's or Qi-ra's, *Solo treats liberation as charming or amusing,
nothing more*.

Anyway, the crown jewel of /Solo/ for many fans will probably be the
scene of the infamous Kessel Run, when Han Solo and Chewbacca first take
the helm(?) of the /Millennium Falcon/ with Lando injured and L3
dissected, using her “navigational database” to plot a very risky
shortcut around the scary space cloud by the scary space squid and the
scary space hole in order to make it to the site of the refinery before
the volatile Uranium explodes. Once there, /darn old flakey Lando/ fucks
the hell of in the /Falcon/ right as the Cloud Riders roll up, but
/whoa!/ their leader is actually a very young woman with freckles! She
describes the atrocities of Crimson Dawn and suggests that Han (who's
now the established decisionmaker for whatever reason) give /them/ the
Uranium in order to establish “the beginning of a rebellion,” which we
can safely assume is /The/ Rebellion, which does beg one to wonder why
Solo never once bragged among the later rebellion about having started
the whole thing in the other films, considering that --- /whaddya
know/ --- he says yes!

Woody, however, says he's going to retire upon the news of this decision
before immediately reappearing again on Scarred Jarvis' yacht after he's
revealed to have betrayed the Uranium ruse to him. Qi-ra ends up killing
Scarred Jarvis, saving Han, but after promising to follow him and
escape, she rings up the late Scarred Jarvis' boss --- a Sith Zabrak
who, I would argue, is /not necessarily/ Darth Maul, though he probably
is --- and informs him that her boss is dead and she's assumed his post.
As Han and Woody meet again in an Old West standoff (complete with
sand,) the latter insists /one more time/ that Qi-ra is not who Han
thinks she is (as Jarvis and Qi-ra herself have also said repeatedly,)
describing her as “a survivor,” before Han kills him in self-defense.

Finally, after seeing the Cloud Riders off with the Uranium, Han finds
Lando once again in a card game --- this time taking care to disable his
sleight-of-hand device beforehand so that he wins the /Millennium
Falcon/, “fair and square,” and we cut to Solo (who seems remarkably
upbeat considering the recent betrayal of the lover he'd longed years to
reunite with) and Chewie in her cockpit as they tie in that one last
knot by declaring their destination, Tatooine, before roaring off into
hyperspace, leaving the credit roll in their wake.

Over two years ago, I concluded [[http://bit.ly/wigglecruise][my first
work for /Extratone/]] about /The Force Awakens/ by arguing that /Star
Wars/ on the big screen should be allowed to die in favor of investing
the time, energy, and funding they require in the pursuit of something
new, but the industry still appears to believe that nostalgia is a surer
bet where profits are concerned, at least, even after two whole decades
of mind-numbing reanimated properties. I didn't catch /The Last Jedi/
until recently, which was remarkably well-done measured against the
others as a /Star Wars/ movie, but certainly didn't aim to achieve much
more. Clearly, there must be some truth in Hollywood's cowardice about
original properties- especially when it comes to the sort of fantasy
armed with potent but unguided emotional bombs that define the /Star
Wars/ universe, so it wouldn't make much sense to revive my old
diatribe, here. (Though I can assure you that I will be relentless if
this horseshit continues for much longer.) /The Force Awakens/ and /The
Last Jedi/, though, were episodic titles for the family, and these
spinoffs that began with /Rogue One/ are supposed to be for... well, I'm
not entirely sure. In reality, they've only moved the proverbial bar up
a very wee bit to the family who occasionally says “shit,” because
they're not intellectually stimulating enough to justify themselves as
Big Boy-only productions. Or, they wouldn't be, were they not part of
this franchise.

The truth is, the fans have grown up, and they... /I/... will still buy
a ticket for the smallest crumb of hope that a product of this huge
machine will be capable of making us feel even a fraction of what we
felt as children watching the original films. For me, /The Force
Awakens/ actually did, once, in that blast of horns before the opening
crawl, but it hasn't happened since, and I should certainly stop
expecting or wanting to expect that it will. For others, it's still
working. Though there was a fraction of who I expected to be in
attendance with me, they did laugh at a handful of (mostly fascist)
moments, and whooped, hollered, and even clapped for a few seconds at
the end. I'm surprised opening night wasn't packed because Portland is
the single most nostalgia-addicted culture I've ever seen anywhere in
the United States. Then again, there /are/ a billion theaters here, so
perhaps the sample is just lousy. We'll see how tomorrow and Sunday go,
but I'd be surprised if any boxoffice records were broken.

In the past, when film enthusiasts andfans have described Han Solo as
“the best character in /Star Wars/,” they've actually been praising his
/potential/ as a character, not his material itself, and /Solo/'s most
effective function as a franchise film was to shut that praise down. Han
was not at all denied his movie --- /this/ is /his/ movie --- and it
provided him the screentime to show us who he truly is and why we
/really/ like him so much: *he doesn't fucking change*. The secret to
Han Solo's moral and emotional resiliency is nothing more than halted
development. The same old inner conflict between the tough, ruthlessly
self-interested persona he does his best to project for everyone around
him and the consistent reality of his soft insides was presented in his
first scene way back in 1977, and we're now sure that he was unable to
make /any/ progress toward its resolution despite openly and obviously
brooding over it for an entire lifetime: from at least as early as his
young adulthood in this film until his death at the hands of his little
Sith son. /There is 0 variation/. He /always/ comes back for the cause
at the crucial moment after declaring himself through with it. Without
fail, he'll sacrifice the entirety of any self-making enterprise for
just about any underdog with a problem who crosses his path. (Which
probably explains his constantly-fleeting success as a smuggler well
into gray hair and jowls.) /Solo/ is abundantly clear about Han's true
nature and very willing to expose how uninteresting it is. When he first
proclaims to Qi-ra that he's become “an outlaw,” she shuts him down with
the film's ultimate quote, insisting that she “knows who [he] /really/
is: /the good guy./”

If the video game-despising fans will bear with me for a moment, it's
worth noting that Bioware's /Star Wars: The Old Republic/ MMORPG is the
most interesting and extensive source of nuanced narrative in the IP (it
holds the world record for the largest voiceover project ever produced,)
and most of it can now be experienced without actually playing the game.
Like /Solo/, it's set pre-saga, but considerably before --- a few
centuries, if I remember correctly, which gave the writers a gigantic
opportunity to both expand and predestine the universe. There are eight
different class stories with around 50 cumulative hours of dialog, each.
A few are relatively unimaginative, but the majority are complex,
exciting, emotionally-involved tales that create very rich characters,
and all of them can be streamed in their entirety on YouTube. If you are
willing to see the potential of a Han Solo-like character fulfilled in a
different medium, the [[http://bit.ly/torsmuggler][Smuggler class
story]] is a pretty damned engaging exploration of the /kind outlaw with
conflicted identity issues/ angle.

From my perspective, /Solo/'s frequent less-than-subtle maltreatment of
some very brutal and sensitive power relationships makes it the most
toxic of the /Star Wars/ films yet, and I assume it ended up that way,
unnecessarily because Ron Howard is an all-American son of a bitch. If
these titles are going to continue to be passed around between bigwhig
directors, future unpleasantries are inevitable. Notably, I've yet to
see any mention of these disturbing themes from the respectable
authorities of the film criticism establishment, who've been
overwhelmingly
[[https://www.newyorker.com/culture/richard-brody/wookiee-nights-solo-a-star-wars-story-reviewed][charmed]]
by /Solo/'s nostalgia. Take from that whatever you will.

If we continue to love the character Han Solo, it'll be in the same way
we love our earnest, foolish, emotionally-stunted manchild fathers who's
developmental inadequacies are often embarrassing, sometimes abusive,
and thoroughly pitiful. /Solo/ leaves no more room for an idealized,
elegant perception of this character --- he's no more than a /pretty
good guy/ with a lifelong addiction to thrill-seeking and a shitload of
luck.

To declare unequivocally whether or not /Solo: A Star Wars Story/ is
worth a trip the cinema with your date, your children, or just your own
damned conscience would require me to disregard a whole host of
complicating factors, but if you've stuck it this far with me, you'd
have a lot to disregard yourself to jump in. I'd advise that parents
watch it themselves before deciding whether or not it's something worth
adding to your child's life. Of those of you like me who'll tow the line
despite what you know and watch a /Star Wars/ film alone on opening
night in delirium hoping for just a drop from the Fountain of Youth, I
would ask: how long are we really going to keep kidding ourselves?

   :END:

/Listen to this review read by Siri Voice 2 below.../

/Is my True Tone bullshit on?/

“True Tone” is so forgettable, everybody had to mention it first. Quite
simply, it uses an ambient light sensor to fiddle with white balance,
warming the colors of the display as an immediately-obvious whole, yes,
but an interesting contrast to show off is no longer inherently
justified in being called a “feature” in Apple products, anymore.
Essentially, no matter who you ask (aside from
[[https://youtu.be/AXU8GqaMsQc?t=7m23s][Jon Rettinger]],) you /should
not/ buy an iPhone 8, though I did last Fall, not only because I had to
suddenly decide on a handset in less than 24 hours, but --- if
anything --- to say goodbye to the form, the operating system, and the
tech company which I have depended upon and carried with me virtually
every day for my entire adult life. I'd originally decided to abandon
this review due to a variety of unexpected circumstances, but Apple and
its iPhone have maintained their place in the news with their
[[https://www.apple.com/iphone-battery-and-performance/][battery
scandal]], and a third of a year with the 8 Plus has included some
experiences which warrant a send-off before iOS 12 is released, making
it (and myself) totally irrelevant forever.

As the longstanding benchmark of the smartphone industry's state at any
given time, the iPhone can be easy to reflect upon as a product once
occupying a state of universal exemption from criticism, but it has, in
fact,
[[http://theweek.com/articles/459748/7-reviews-original-iphone-from-2007][never
been so]]. As Nilay Patel
[[https://www.theverge.com/2017/9/19/16323570/apple-new-iphone-8-review-plus-2017][noted]],
one might regard the 8 as the last compromise of “basically four years”
of the same design. Since launch, it's unsurprisingly stayed a wee bit
too far behind on the spreadsheets for most Android-type folks --- not
that I've ever believed them truthfully incapable of comprehending what
it means to /package/ a product, given where their greasy startups all
eventually ended up. (*You cannot doubt me* --- I once took a year-long
sabbatical from iOS with a [[https://youtu.be/nSWgS0l0kc8][Sony Xperia
Play]], and my authority is absolute.) The rest are trying to decide
whether or not to pay $200 more for
“[[https://www.wsj.com/articles/iphone-8-apples-middle-child-1505322945][the
phone of the future]],” which knows when you're watching it, and is only
good for playing half an hour of stupid video games before it needs a
charge.

So far, I have maintained that my first generation iPhone was the best
handset of all time --- one hell of an Email Machine that lasted me
close to five years --- throughout the last two with actual motherboard
exposed to the elements in the corner of its cracked screen. That said,
who knows how it'd feel to be coerced into using “iPhone OS 2” as it was
called, then, for an entire workday in 2018? Two years prior to bringing
home an 8 Plus, I [[http://bit.ly/drycast47][vowed]] that my 6S Plus
would be my last ever Apple device, but this one /actually/ feels like a
last hurrah. Though the ability to /Tweet directly from the swipe-down
notification menu/ is still nowhere to be found (it's been gone for 5
releases, now, and would seem to have been forgotten by /literally/
everyone but myself,) one gets the sense that Apple's efforts to add to
the iPhone 8 and iOS 11 were to make amends with us by settling a few
debts.

In part, they did. Native apps got a major overhaul --- including Mail,
which was startling, considering that I'd been looking at what was near
as makes no difference the same UI my eldest phone shipped with. As a
result, it alone constitutes my benchmark for an email service, and I
have been left without a clue as to what /a good one/ looks like.
(Apparently it was
[[https://www.pcmag.com/article/342889/the-best-mobile-email-client-apps][really
bad]]?) Since time began, there has always been at least one alternative
email app of the moment that tech journos refer to as the must-have,
end-all replacement.
[[https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/email-edison-mail/id922793622?mt=8][Edison
Mail]] is currently the smoother, faster, most modular option --- at
least for another few minutes-- but I'll never know it as I know Mail,
and I'll never want to. Playing around with experimental email apps is
too scary. What if I decide once again to kill that massive number in
the red badge and need to immediately mark 40,000 emails as read? It
took all of my iPhone 4's 1.0Ghz CPU and proprietary software over 18
hours --- how am I supposed to trust a shabby little 6-month-old startup
with such an important task? Anybody with a hundred bucks can make an
app, you know.

*** Why is the App Store now the best-looking publishing software on
iOS?
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: section0045.xhtml#why-is-the-app-store-now-the-best-looking-publishing-software-on-ios
    :END:

One might interpret the App Store's redesign as an attempt by Apple to
control this conversation --- of both the trending /new thing/ and the
old“essentials” that you've probably had tucked away in an untouched
folder for years. Technically, whoever the hell is writing those
gorgeously-presented daily bits has made them a publishing company,
though I'm not so sure I'm not the last remaining user who's continued
semi-regularly visiting their “Today” section. If I /did/ want to
actually read about apps (I don't --- who does?) it wouldn't make much
sense to seek critical reviews from the faceless boffins behind the
platform itself, regardless of how much better it may look than all of
the tech news sites, paywall or no.

Native screen recording could conceivably come in handy once or twice,
but I see no reason why the red bar must remain at the top of the
render, but it has, which could explain the total lack of any such video
in the wild. Front-facing 4K, 60fps capture is impressive, but
useless --- vloggers all have GoPros or DSLRs, these days, and sharing
through Snapchat and Instagram will always be ultra-compressed. (Here
are two sloppy test clips --- [[https://youtu.be/VnfkWkotGFw][at the
zoo]], and [[https://youtu.be/KOs5m6ynKAI][fishing]].)

Perhaps some have figured out the new Files “app,” but it's sat on my
homescreen for months, untapped, and it will likely remain there for all
time as a sort of soothing trophy --- a thanks for my legacy iPhone
loyalty. My reward for half a lifetime of syncing, scrolling, and
tolling? *I can now view some of the files on my Mobile Computing
Device*, and even /scan documents in/, which is mostly novel (though it
is fun to digitize excerpts from physical text.) At some point, I
must've mischecked a permanent option because all file types now open
only in an app that does not recognize them. God bless.

[[file:xhtml/https:/i.snap.as/fuMs1a4.jpg]]

Somehow, I've managed to fill my social circle with precisely zero
iOS-using folks. All of my friends and colleagues use Android devices
(including [[https://soundcloud.com/extratonemagazine/nextbit][Tim's
supercool Nextbit Robin]],) which provide a few handy datapoints (like
the camera in [[https://flic.kr/p/BXruaL][my fiance's Galaxy S8]],) but
deprive me of any significant experience with the ostensibly
intoxicating cult of iMessage. I'm constantly listening to and reading
tech writers claim that it's
[[https://www.theverge.com/2016/10/10/13225514/apple-iphone-cant-switch-pixel-android-imessage-addiction][one
of the only reasons they're still using iPhones]], but my own food-OS
loving biome has forced me to find others, and frankly, I can't imagine
looking at the
[[http://www.extratone.com/audio/futureland/toomanymessengers/][/gluttonous/]]
palate of available mobile, cross-platform messaging services (Telegram,
[[https://telegram.org/blog/telegram-x][now Telegram X]], WhatsApp,
Signal, Snapchat, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Discord, Slack,
/Tinder?/, Google Hangouts, Google Allo, Google Chat, Viber, Skype,
Line, Wire, etc.) and thinking... /well, none of this will do/!

Honestly --- even if I'd actually been at all informed in my haste, the
photographic capabilities of the 8 Plus, alone would've sold it. It's
not the new filters, gif functionality, or even “3D Photos” --- it's
those mythical dual 12MP sensors (which it shares with something called
the iPhone X.) They're no less than infallible. After four months of
[[http://bit.ly/ip8plus][astonishing captures]]in all manner of
conditions, I don't even care how exactly they do it anymore --- it's
better to be left marveling. This first example was taken at Keystone,
Colorado in the middle of a dark, cloudy Fall night --- the amount of
light they were able to find --- “up to 80% more,”
[[https://www.apple.com/apple-events/september-2017/][according to
Apple]] --- is just /impossible/.

/The vast majority of the samples in my iPhone 8 Flickr Album were taken
within the native Camera app as it ships and left unedited. (Especially
before just a few weeks ago, when I

Here is an unquestionably sensible progression from which iPhone has
never wavered far since its fourth generation
[[http://www.extratone.com/words/inred/iphone4/][set the standard]], but
it's one of an unfortunate few. Siri is still useless and silly apart
from its “disable all alarms” feature and its ability to sound itself
off in response when you're hysterically screaming and digging for it
through the vast plush of a forty-year-old Lincoln. The customizable
Control Center makes toggling low power mode, orientation lock, Wi-Fi,
and Bluetooth less frustrating (note the last two
[[https://www.wired.com/story/how-to-turn-off-wifi-and-bluetooth-in-ios11/][aren't
quite hard switches]],) though it should've come years ago.
Notifications are slightly more sensible -certainly better than they
were on Android Gingerbread, but I've heard things've changed quite a
bit since then.

I /have/ been tripped up by the lack of a 3.5mm audio jack a few times,
but it just [[http://www.extratone.com/words/inred/mono/][wouldn't make
sense]] from a hardware perspective, and the new external stereo
capability should refute those who can't or won't understand. Yes, it
would be nice if Apple hadn't led the industry to quite such a
compromising obsession with thinness --- we'd all trade /a lot/of
substance for exponentially greater battery life, storage capacity,
water resistance, etc. --- but I don't see much sense in expending your
energy holding up signs in Silicon Valley.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  I'll be here long after you've died, and you know why? Because I took
  the time to sync my apps.
#+END_QUOTE

Two years ago, a new generation of social apps and the preposterous
notion of a quad-core CPU in my iPhone 6S Plus seemed like the harbinger
of a world I no longer understood. Now, most of those services have
expanded to the far boundaries of my reach, and I've stopped counting
chips. Refinement of the hardware design is reverent to the extreme.
It's pretentious, but Apple's decision to pause on the 8 to consider
details like stuffing the legal text in the software and adding a little
bit of weight /back in/ for ergonomics' sake leads one to regard it as a
monument to all the devices along the development timeline that have led
to this... last triumph. Or, it would have perhaps, had they not
[[https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2018/02/apple-reports-first-quarter-results/][sold
so many]].

One could argue that good execution of consumer electronic design means
minimizing as much as possible the obstructions in the way of the user
completing any given task, and the iPhone 8 Plus has surpassed the vast
majority of these for myself --- and I am, surely, a “power user.” iOS
has changed a lot in the decade I've employed it --- in far too many
ways for the worse --- but this pair of handset and software have
reached /my/ imagination's limit for what I could possibly want to do.
Augmented reality and wireless charging won't ever have a place in my
future, for better or worse. Face ID is much too peculiar. Surely, this
iPhone is the ultimate expression of the first and fourth generation's
foundation.

If the 6S Plus was indeed the key to my immortality, I'm afraid the 8
Plus heralds my imminent demise. Whether or not it's an early one is for
you to decide. This /really is/ my last iPhone.

On a recent Tuesday, I opened a just-begun
[[https://www.facebook.com/NASA/videos/10156260187261772/][livestream]]
on Facebook from NASA's official page with a panel of experts discussing
Europa's plumes (or something like that) and ended up sticking around
for most of its hour-long duration because of the ridiculous realtime
comments from some of its ~4000 viewers. While some participants were
genuinely interested in the opportunity to engage the host's authority
with relevant and invested questions (which were intermittently
fielded,) the vocal majority were aggressive, ignorant, and provocative
shouts. From my observation, the most noticeably manic and persistent of
these came from user [[https://www.facebook.com/shane.langman][Shane
Langman]]. “Nasa can telephone the moon in 1969 but can't get a phone
signal in death Valley in 2018,” he noted 16 minutes in. “We cant leave
the earth or we'd have left it by now.” And there was Bobby Smith, who
felt compelled to express his authority on NASA's inauthenticity:
“[I've] been researching since 2012 no real pics of anything all cgi.”

[[file:xhtml/https:/i.snap.as/STK8JwB.png]]

Assuming the additional all-caps, sans-avatar ranting I remember reading
live was deleted after the fact by the culprits and/or the page's
administrator, it's worth noting that the remaining archive is full of
sincerely positive feedback: “It would be awesome to discover life in
europe!!” Indeed.

After a few minutes of gawking at the mess, I noticed that the broadcast
was being simultaneously
[[https://www.pscp.tv/NASA/1lDxLapRyjLKm][streamed on Periscope]] (or is
it Twitter Video? or Twitter Live?) so I opened both feeds side-by-side
to compare their audience's behavior. The Periscope's viewers averaged
about 1000 strong, and their comments were noticeably more orderly and
decipherable. There was still trolling and self-promotion, but it wasn't
allowed to disrupt the rest of the committed discourse, perhaps because
of each post's character limit or rationed screen time. Looking between
them, the contrast in the user culture and the function of the two
services during the same, simultaneous stream was at discouraging odds
with their respective popularity.

Neither are really very good ways to watch live video -- Periscope,
notably, was never designed for professional studio broadcasts -- but
the relentless malicious nonsense from the Facebook viewers pushed all
attempts at real engagement away so quickly that I could see no point in
making them at all. To be blunt: every conceivable corner of Facebook is
an unusable cesspool (even in the shadow of NASA earnestness,) and its
worth considering that something about the design of Twitter properties
generally discourages such overwhelmingly stupid noise. That's not to
say that harassment, hate speech, misogyny, and radical racism have not
been religiously neglected or mishandled as has been well-reported
throughout the network's history -- perhaps even more than any other --
but I (a cis white man, mind you,) have seen /much/ more of these on
Facebook in the wild than I have on Twitter during my longtime use of
the two, despite spending exponentially more attention on the latter.

In my sparse Facebook browsing, I have witnessed childhood friends,
professional acquaintances, and family members both distant and
immediate publicly shame, harass, belittle, and spitefully argue with
each other for the sake of absolutely zero meaningful resolution,
conclusion, or intellectual progression. In my decade of daily Twitter
use, I have seen tens of pedophiles and rapists publicly outed, suicides
averted, government censorship circumvented, stories broken, artists
made, and marginalized voices outspoken. I have also Tweeted things in
the past (mostly variations of “I want to die”) that would now get my
account temporarily suspended, as per the company's
[[https://mashable.com/2017/10/17/twitter-hate-speech-abuse-new-rules-women-boycott/][latest
attempts]] to minimize its platform's toxicity -- an encouraging
suggestion that Twitter is finally catching up and learning to avoid its
/cultural/ blunders, which have been the single greatest exception to
its most valuable core identity: its mistakes.

[[file:xhtml/https:/i.snap.as/xznLHiq.png]]

Two weeks ago, Twitter
[[https://blog.twitter.com/official/en_us/topics/product/2018/a-new-twitter-experience-on-windows.html][proudly
released]] the first redesign of its native Windows 10 app since its
debut in 2015 -- leading a new generation of upcoming “lightweight”
Progressive Web Apps and -- true to form -- immediately reclaimed the
title of clumsiest, least-useful Twitter client available. PWAs
represent the industry's readiest effort to
“[[https://medium.freecodecamp.org/progressive-web-apps-bridging-the-gap-between-web-and-mobile-apps-a08c76e3e768][bridge]]
[[https://medium.freecodecamp.org/progressive-web-apps-bridging-the-gap-between-web-and-mobile-apps-a08c76e3e768][the
gap between web and mobile apps]],” for which expanded compatibility
must surely be the best case to make.
[[https://developers.google.com/web/progressive-web-apps/][According to
Google]] -- supreme enemy of the open web and all tasteful design --
PWAs are /offline-first/, /instant-loading/, and /immersive/ -- none of
which are reasonable priorities in building a Twitter client for
Windows, an operating system running primarily on very powerful
hardware. This sort of idiocy can be reasonably expected of Twitter, but
bewilderingly, the Great Minds of tech journalism seem to be unanimously
pleased by this decision, which invites one to suspect that they've all
switched secretly to the exclusive, illustrious
[[https://www.theguardian.com/technology/askjack/2017/may/18/windows-smartphone-still-worth-buying][HP
Elite X3]] -- the only smartphone on sale running Windows 10, because
Twitter's execution of these misaligned goals is mindbogglingly foul to
look at and unnecessarily frustrating to use. After doing my best to put
up with it for a few days, I found myself unable to conceieve of a
single advantage this new application has over literally any
alternative.

3 out of the 5 bulleted “highly-requested features” listed in their
[[https://blog.twitter.com/official/en_us/topics/product/2018/a-new-twitter-experience-on-windows.html][announcement]]
are just... catching the app up with the web client as it's been for
years: the 280-character limit, Explore tab, and Bookmarks. “Adding”
these web-established operations to an even-more-web-based application
surely didn't present much of a workload, but perhaps /removing/
functionality justified the investment. The F and T keys no longer
operate as shortcuts for liking and retweeting, which is such a
misguided oversight that I can't help but wonder if this app was
actually intended to be utilized by anyone at all (besides HP Elite
users.)

/Am I missing something? Can you hear me? Are there any flesh-and-blood
Twitters users left?/

[[file:xhtml/https:/i.snap.as/FQvW9MC.png]]

Then again, the ungainliness of Twitter's new offspring could be
attributed to the perpetual tragedy of its mother's peril. The company's
luck has been on the down-and-out for eons in tech time: from its most
recent
[[https://www.wired.com/story/change-your-twitter-password-right-now/][plain
text password blunder]], to its constant inability to
[[https://www.theverge.com/2015/2/4/7982099/twitter-ceo-sent-memo-taking-personal-responsibility-for-the][handle
abuse]], its endlessly tumultuous
[[https://www.cnbc.com/2016/06/07/twitter-is-replacing-its-head-of-product-again.html][management
turnovers]], and its growing disinterest and disfavor among
[[https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/27/16552536/twitter-user-survey-unpopular-abuse-donald-trump][the
public]] and
[[https://www.theverge.com/2016/10/14/13287818/no-one-wants-to-buy-twitter][potential
investors]] alike -- our cultural relationship with Twitter and its
identity as a social network remains dramatically tense well past its
tenth year, which is good news for its continued survival. One could
certainly
[[https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/jan/05/can-donald-trump-save-twitter][argue]]
that the Tump presidency alone spared Twitter from a painful decline
into irrelevance (or at least postponed it,) but I think we should
acknowledge by now that turmoil is an integral component of the brand as
an outlier in the connected community palette.

For myself as a long-dependent occupant, its inconsistencies and
contradictions are endearing and necessary -- a competent, profitable,
and sensical Twitter may as well be Facebook. If you've been Tweeting as
long as I have, you'll likely remember that the company's own offerings
had occupied the bottom-most position in the hierarchy of preferable
available clients throughout time and across all manner of operating
systems until it finally nailed its Android and iOS software and usurped
longtime third-party staples like
[[https://techcrunch.com/2015/10/01/tweetbot-4-0-becomes-the-best-alternative-twitter-client-for-iphone-and-now-ipad/][Tweetbot]]
and
[[https://9to5mac.com/2015/01/26/twitterrific-5-ios-update-multi-image-support-videos-gifs/][Twitterific]]
just a few years ago. Gadget blogging and
[[https://youtu.be/DP5Y-58mHic][/What's in my Dock?/]] videos may very
well be long-dead relics of a different era in tech media, but it's
disheartening to find through research that the steadily-declining
quality of our user experience has been allowed to continue without much
protest. Justifiably or not, Twitter has persisted in adding stuff
nobody likes as they've gradually neutered all the great third-party
development.

TweetDeck for Windows was perhaps the most powerful mainstream enduser
social application that will ever exist. Before
[[https://techcrunch.com/2011/05/23/twitter-buys-tweetdeck-for-40-million/][Twitter
absorbed the tool]] in 2011, its [[https://youtu.be/HQhnbrwBfSw][diverse
account integration]] allowed a user to send a single post across
Facebook, LinkedIn, MySpace, Google+, and multiple Twitter accounts
simultaneously, and they could configure the client to do so with just
the Enter key! In retrospect, it was naive to assume that such potent
spam capabilities would continue to be entrusted to the general
population without challenge, but the modularity and customizability of
TweetDeck prime as a standalone application made it useful as hell and
quite the power trip. Now, it exists only as a tamed,
up-to-brand-guidelines [[https://tweetdeck.twitter.com][web
application]], yet remains the definitive way to use Twitter on a PC if
one desires an ad-free, single-window experience if only because of its
congruence with another, even more forgotten feature of the service:
/lists./

[[file:xhtml/https:/i.snap.as/lGp1lWB.png]]

This is how I've seen desktop Twitter since I lasted looked at my
timeline in 2010. Since then, I've followed about 5000 more accounts, so
I'd imagine it's a damned mess. I have a private list of my friends,
which I try to read in its entirety, and
[[https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/lists/the-new][a list of nearly 500
journalists, publications, and musicians]] whom I've found particularly
fresh and original. Thanks to these, Tweets are presented in order,
uninterrupted by ads. (They function the same on iOS.) The network's
linear chronology is an absolute use condition for me, so I'm thankful I
completely missed the
[[https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/vv7g9d/twitter-is-testing-timelines-that-arent-in-chronological-order][beginning
of their progression toward algorithmic relevance]] thanks to my lists,
and as I've since happened upon distress from mutuals and non-mutuals
over
[[https://twitter.com/daniellemattoon/status/990079819202351104][missed
or stale Tweets]], I have taken the time to relay my gospel: /lists are
linear/. And since promoted and sponsored Tweets began overwhelming and
perturbing timelines, I've seen
[[https://twitter.com/kikkujo/status/996613451349815296][the
displeasure]] and repeated: /lists are linear and ad-free/!

I realize how irritating it is when one plays the /why doesn't anyone
listen to me?!/ card, so I've created a
[[https://twitter.com/i/moments/996616971880882176][Twitter Moment]] to
document the confusing silence I've gotten in response to these
suggestions (though I couldn't find any cases from the past, so I may be
misremembering the extent of my charity,) and pledging to refrain from
revisiting this pet advice of mine when writing about Twitter or other
social networks in the future.

   :END:

I have only once in my many using years been gripped by the fear of the
Lord because of a software-related event. I was cruising my pitifully
ugly Google News feed on an October afternoon in 2015 looking for the
last little bit of material for the evening's episode of /Drycast/, when
I happened to spy the words
“[[http://www.businessinsider.com/evernote-is-in-deep-trouble-2015-10][Evernote
is in Serious Trouble]].” I doubt I screamed or anything, but I
definitely remember experiencing a very real, full-body shot of
adrenaline because /my entire creative life/ was contained at the time
within the nearly 40,000 notes I'd amassed on my Evernote account since
the service's
[[https://web.archive.org/web/20120904074223/http://blog.evernote.com/2008/06/24/evernote-public-launch/][open
beta]] in 2008. In fact, I was in that very moment using it for the live
show notes and so began to wonder how I could possibly continue if
Evernote were to be suddenly killed dead. For better or worse, though,
the “unicorn” would indeed survive to see its tenth birthday this year,
though it's arguably been eclipsed by the notetaking, journaling, and
word processing services its features predated and for which it was the
most significant forerunner not so long ago.

I'd been using the cloud-synced notetaking service for all of my
composition and research gathering since Junior High, when I thought
myself extremely clever with my cloud-syncing, iPhone-native notetaking
app when I'd watch other students struggling to find a flash drive or
log in to their email on school library computers. Since it worked with
any browser and my password was memorable (before the brute force
apocalypse and the need for password managers,) I could access my
documents, mp3s, and images /from anywhere,/ which was actually a pretty
big deal --- especially as more research and notetaking was required in
high school.

Yes, 10 years later, we are /swamped/ with infinite duplicates of
documents from our personal clouds, which are now inescapable and
plenty --- they follow us around from our pockets, purses, and backpacks
and rain notifications down upon us for single punctuation mark peer
edits, unnoticeable modification conflicts, or sometimes just for the
hell of it. There are now what seems like infinitely many available ways
to enter, edit, and publish text from wherever you happen to be, and
most of them are free, but very few are actually pleasantly executed
tools --- all of which can all be said of most types of software now.
Since tech publications (and even tech /bloggers/ now,) aren't doing
software reviews anymore because you won't click on them, the task of
comparing between the lot so that you might be spared having to mess
around with /all/ of them to find out for yourself --- the function of
consumer journalism --- has fallen to myself, alone because the /Fear of
The Unclicked/ is not known to me.

To assist me in bearing this terrible burden, you can allocate 1--3
minutes to [[http://bit.ly/howwewrite][*take the survey I created*]]
about the text-entry tools you use to determine which tools people use
at different points in their writing process and across several uses. It
would be very much appreciated.

** Feature Fucked
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: section0047.xhtml#feature-fucked
   :END:

Reading this via printed PDF, your hypothetical 100% offline
grandmother --- the successful children's book author who needs word
processing but doesn't require connectivity because she doesn't do
research or correspond with anyone --- might ask /well whatever was the
matter with Microsoft Word? Surely I don't need more than that!/
Technically, she'd be correct in a major sense: Word has been able to
sync via Microsoft OneDrive between PC or Mac with iOS or Android for a
while now, but I wouldn't vouch for the latter for any use other than
reading or very lightly editing a document because the relationship
between the mobile apps and their desktop counterparts is inevitably
strained. Because Microsoft Word is such old software, it's filled with
some obscure functionalities I'm sure even its creators have forgotten.
Over years and years of development, these tools have been stacked on
top of one another so that actually mastering the labyrinth could be a
college major in and of itself.

[[file:xhtml/https:/i.snap.as/JUh9srV.png]]

Basically, you can tell your grandmother that *Microsoft Word is a huge
old bitch*, but it's still the industry standard for formatting and
publishing works at the end of the line. As you can see from our survey
results, *58.1% of you use “legacy” word processing software to finish
up your first drafts* (as of May 30th,) which makes you more modern than
even a slightly-older population, I'd wager.

While we're on the subject of the old hag, it's worth pointing out how
ridiculously behind the times its open source “alternatives” are.
*OpenOffice*'s last major update was the
[[https://blogs.apache.org/OOo/entry/a_short_celebration_and_then][release
of version 4.0]] in July of 2013, and it's not correctly scaled for the
small, high-DPI displays sold at just about every price level, nowadays.
It was okay when I couldn't afford to pay for a license in high school
(and saw no reason to,) but it now looks sort of awful, especially
considering that the version of Office (and therefore Word) to which I'm
comparing its screenshots is actually /also/ from 2013.

The other, “fresher” open source option of the moment is called
*LibreOffice Writer*, and its suite has been attracting a fair amount of
praise --- I think
“[[https://www.zdnet.com/article/libreoffice-the-best-office-suite-gets-even-better-with-libreoffice-6-0/][every
bit as good]] [as Word]” is taking things a bit far, but its sixth
version looks significantly better than OpenOffice on /my/ machine, at
least, and generally operates more smoothly as well. That age-old banner
of /Open Source/ won't matter for much longer, though, if all kinds of
software continue to be abandoned and substituted with Progressive Web
Apps for [[http://bit.ly/uselists][no damned reason]]. Considering how
much time some of us have already spent in front of Word, it's no wonder
we're spoiled: even my 5-year-old edition of Microsoft Office syncs with
the app on my iPhone (with some pleading,) and looks /extremely/ crisp.
As far as paid featured desktop-class alternatives, there's just one
more: *WordPerfect*, which I have never used or heard anyone else
mention.

** The Hybrids
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: section0047.xhtml#the-hybrids
   :END:

When it was conceived, *Evernote* pioneered the recipe that now serves
as the foundation of the feature development in today's notetaking and
journaling applications, as evidenced by CEO Phil Libin's unapologetic
use of the term
“[[https://techcrunch.com/2009/12/30/evernote-two-million/][life-logging]]”
in 2009, which sounds bizarre in retrospect because we're now
well-accustomed to easily “snapping geotagged photos” (smartphones had
always included location data in their photo files' meta, but Evernote
was the first app to give a user access to the data /on their device/,)
“making voice notes,” or and organizing text notes via advanced
categorization and metadata-enabled searchability. These features are
essentials in the apps you could accurately describe as “life-loggers”
available for download now. Snapchat's “Memories” especially come to
mind, and I've long argued that we should
[[http://bit.ly/redevernote][blame (or praise) Evernote for beginning
the era of eternal memory]].

The iPhone OS app's design would even influence Apple's own
[[https://www.theverge.com/2013/9/18/4741724/ios-7-review][additions to
its native photo and note applications in iOS7]], much further down the
line. Its technical doctrine of on-device storage coupled with syncing
via The Cloud would inspire both
[[https://www.pcmag.com/commentary/345839/evernotes-loss-is-onenotes-gain][Microsoft's
OneNote]] and
[[https://www.theverge.com/2012/8/3/3212579/the-best-journal-app-day-one][Bloom's
gorgeous DayOne]]. There was even a “full-featured”
[[http://howardcodner.blogspot.com/2011/02/nevernote-is-full-featured-evernote-app.html][Linux-running
offshoot called NeverNote]].

In contrast with Evernote's relatively busy design, *DayOne* has been
the
[[https://thesweetsetup.com/apps/the-very-best-journaling-logging-app/][best-looking
app of any kind on iOS for years]]. It shipped with the same sort of
extensive categorization, but it's only ever been available on iOS,
Android, and OSX --- probably because Windows simply doesn't look good
enough. Should you wish, it will add detailed metadata from the moment
you begin each journal entry including precise-ish GPS coordinates, an
overview of your location's weather at the time, /whether or not you
were moving/, what song you were listening to, and your step count for
the day (now from the Health app.) You have the option of viewing your
journal chronologically, by location on a map, or in a social-esque
activity feed, and yes --- its search function can be filtered by any of
these datapoints.

In 2015,
[[https://thesweetsetup.com/day-one-updated-with-new-sync-option/][Bloom
added iCloud syncing]] and multiple journals, further closing the
functionality gap between the two apps on paper, yet plenty of users
continue to tether between the two using IFTTT (including myself for all
my Twitter favorites, just to compare.) Within the somewhat forgotten
niche of the “life-logging” utility, DayOne is superior and serves well
the self-obsessed user who find the little details of their life to be
/extremely interesting./ Last Spring,
[[https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2017/4/25/15426678/day-one-book-print-journal][they
introduced]] the option to purchase a stylized physical book of a user's
journal from within the app. As it is currently priced, the 2,674-page
book I previewed today containing every single Tweet I've favorited in
the past 5 years displayed in a delicately-formatted layout would set me
back over $365, and would have to be split into 5 separate books (as per
the maximum of 400 pages each.) Since I find my life /very/ interesting,
I've made a note to myself to proceed if/when I ever have that sort of
money to throw around.

For the *67.7%* of you who use digital notetaking or word processing
software when you “*want to remember something*,” DayOne is the best
option available because of its search function and satisfaction-of-use.
Though Evernote was once the only app that could
“[[https://www.theverge.com/2014/9/4/6103843/best-note-taking-app-iphone][handle
everything everything in your head]],” it's a different experience
entirely --- tailored for work applications, if anything, since DayOne's
growth spurt. The company, itself hasn't exactly been managed cleanly,
either with
[[https://www.theverge.com/2015/9/29/9420031/evernote-layoffs-office-closures][layouts
in 2015]] and
[[https://www.theverge.com/2016/12/16/13979778/evernote-privacy-policy-opt-out][a
privacy scandal in 2016]], but then again, what billion-dollar company
doesn't have its controversies?

Despite having imported my huge catalog of Evernote entries into DayOne,
the former often gets stuck, and it's retained the most irritating habit
of all the software mentioned in this column. Because synced entries in
Evernote are not live-updated like those in Google Docs or Dropbox
Paper, it's possible to modify or add to a note on one device while it's
open (and static) on another, which is addressed by either duplicating
the most recent entry and filing it in the default “Conflicting Changes”
folder, or pasting the duplicate of the entire contents above the “old”
content in the note, separated by a horizontal line. I've yet to figure
out the behavior that triggers which fix, but I don't particularly
care --- I've decided to restrict my Evernote use to my desktop,
absolutely. If I haven't articulated it well enough for you to form a
visual, just trust me: *it's very, very annoying*, and it should've been
addressed years ago.

It was my stepfather who told me about Evernote and signed me up for
that beta. Both of us were then the sort of people who experienced
extreme satisfaction in archiving and categorizing stuff (which is
probably the most straightforward way to define /nerd/,) but he was
especially and absolutely enthralled with its
[[https://blog.evernote.com/blog/2008/06/26/web-clipping/][Web Clipper
function]], which allowed the user to save webpages with
“context” --- both the metadata (source URL, date) and contents in “the
text, images, and links” via their Firefox extension, which was
revolutionary from our perspective, and certainly beat the hell out of
stuffed, ugly bookmark folders or printed-to-pdfs. However, Web 2.0 was
a younger, then and
[[http://www.websiteoptimization.com/speed/tweak/average-web-page/][significantly
more lithe]] --- the average web page is now /10 times larger/
(disclosure:
[[https://www.igvita.com/2016/01/12/the-average-page-is-a-myth/][“average
web page” is a somewhat misleading term]], though I think we can
probably agree that it's /too fucking big/, regardless,) and it's long
past time for us to accept that this technology is no longer a
reasonable solution to saved images.

[[file:xhtml/https:/i.snap.as/eKdKSyd.png]]

Though development on the Web Clipper appears to have continued --- it's
now on Version 7.something --- the vast majority of the pages you'd want
to save on the web
([[https://twitter.com/FickleCrux/status/1001763470902099968][except for
Linkedin, apparently]],) show Evernote's age as it attempts to clip
them --- often taking /several minutes/ to yield the product, which is
/always/ broken as hell. Don't take my word for it, though: another one
of Evernote's less-discussed features /technically/ makes it a
publishing platform because I can share a note from my account with you,
the world, via
[[http://www.evernote.com/l/ACT8YDUZovlFS6iWaPOsGpW9uVFqlXkt2YQ/][this
public link]]. It's a clip I took a year ago of
[[https://www.wired.com/2014/02/myspace_jad/][/Wired/'s profile of Jad
Abumrad]], and you'll notice that it isn't /completely/ unreadable, but
it /is/ ugly and broken. Even after
[[https://techcrunch.com/2017/01/17/evernote-attempts-to-simplify-with-its-new-ios-app/][last
year's update]], it's still clumsy, slow, and virtually unusable without
a stellar data connection.

*Archive obsessives*, I know that Evernote could have become part of
/your system/ and over time, you may have built a gargantuan library
within it --- the perfection of your tagging system's efficiency and
your categorical format's consistency making it such a treasure that you
might think of it in times of duress to calm yourself. I've allowed
myself to continue using it /exclusively/ for notes in my novel project,
so I do understand that it may represent tens of thousands of hours of
your time and that losing it would cause you tremendous grief, /but/...
*it's time to let go* and better your life by exploring the selection of
alternatives and their superior capabilities.

[[file:xhtml/https:/i.snap.as/Tl62RVD.png]]

As you'd expect, software has changed a lot
[[https://lifehacker.com/5590027/five-best-mobile-note-taking-tools][since
2010]], and the choices available for word processing are now abundant
and relatively diverse. As for web clipping, in particular, I would
suggest your new browser Vivaldi and its super capable
[[https://vivaldi.com/blog/seize-the-moment-with-vivaldi-1-7/][full-page
capture feature]], which I've used for everything from snapping a
[[http://extratone.com/media/alltratodata.png][25.1 MB, 30,000
pixel-high PNG capture of all Extranet data in text form]] to the
[[http://bit.ly/extrfonts][photo specimens we submitted to Fonts in
Use]], to
[[https://twitter.com/FickleCrux/status/969833640598306817][crisp snips
of full words]]. For comparison,
[[http://extratone.com/media/jadwired.png][here's what it captured]] of
that old /Wired/ post on Jad. You'll notice that while the image is
relatively large, none of the article itself has been lost (aside from
the featured image, on /Wired/'s end,) and the resolution is fine enough
that you could still crop out quotes or smaller shots to share if you
discovered something later. This ability of Vivaldi's still feels like
magic to me, and there are plenty of other reasons to use the browser,
but I'll save that discussion for a later date.

I could cite plenty of pseudoidealistic reasons to /never/ use Google
Chrome, Google Docs, Google Keep, or any other Google product, really,
mostly because they all look like shit,
[[https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/4/16805216/google-chrome-only-sites-internet-explorer-6-web-standards][their
browser is swallowing the internet]], (along with their
“[[https://www.theverge.com/2018/2/13/17006006/google-amp-stories-google-search-slideshows][accelerated
mobile pages]]” project,) and just about everything the company was
built on --- along with
[[https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/17/17365362/google-chrome-secure-indicator-https][what
they plan for the future]] --- is completely (and sometimes even
[[https://gizmodo.com/google-removes-nearly-all-mentions-of-dont-be-evil-from-1826153393][explicitly]])
opposed to The Open Web, good design, and
[[http://bit.ly/googlechurch][humanity as a whole]]. However, I fully
realize that idealism doesn't mean shit when you're just trying to get
the job done, so let's talk about Keep and Docs.

*Google Keep* is part notetaking service and part streamlined,
modernized, hassle-free execution of Evernote's Web Clipper. If you're
already using Chrome or you're desperate enough for the ability to clip
web pages without switching windows for whatever reason that you'd
change your browsing habits entirely, you can add its extension to the
top task bar --- right next to Evernote's --- and use it any time you
feel that old archivist itch. The extension will very quickly and
smoothly clip the title and URL, along with whatever of your own
text/tags you feel like using, but it will /not/ attempt to capture any
of the web page's content (Google already has it somewhere, anyway.)

[[file:xhtml/https:/i.snap.as/Uw8kvMU.png]]

Like all of its kin, Google Keep is particularly
[[https://www.computerworld.com/article/3026239/android/google-keep-3-years.html][savvy
with integration]]: you can immediately send your clip to a Google Doc,
set a reminder, add a collaborator and even /draw/ on any entry. Its
party piece in this Tactile Era of touch-enabled laptops and
keyboard-equipped tablets is its ability to digitize handwriting or
“grab image text,” a novelty technology called Optical Character
Recognition, which has been
[[http://history-computer.com/ModernComputer/Basis/OCR.html][tickling
our most stale fantasies for centuries]], now. Though I'm sure it's
genuinely appreciated in a handful of especially quaint use cases,
somewhere in the world, there's never going to be an at-scale
application for this sort of thing. I know my handwriting is bad, but if
[[http://bit.ly/keephand][Keep can't “grab” it reliably]], there's not
much sense in using it at all for me, though Google's Academy for Young
Algorithms will certainly make sure to save every one of my motions to
capitalize on /my/ time (or yours.)

*Microsoft OneNote* is as clunky, busy, and buggy as Google Keep is
quick and uninspiring, but that's probably because it's much /much/
older than I remember. To demonstrate its web clipping function, I
clipped the
[[https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,1273091,00.asp][OneNote
portion]] of
[[https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,1273084,00.asp][/PCMagazine/'s
Microsoft Office 2003 review]] and exported it into a
[[http://extratone.com/library/onenote-pcmag.pdf][PDF]], which isn't a
straightforward process, but is it useful? No. Because it's a PDF, it's
almost unreadably low-resolution, yet manages to weigh 1.2 MB. My
(cropped) [[http://extratone.com/media/onenote2003.png][Vivaldi capture
of the same page]] is 988 kB and nearly impossible to tell apart from
the live experience, so why are we bothering with OneNote at all? Well,
according to
[[https://www.computerworld.com/article/2488890/enterprise-applications/desktop-apps-onenote-vs-evernote-a-personal-take-on-two-great-note-taking-apps.html][Preston
Gralla for /ComputerWorld/]] (the last tech site still publishing
worthwhile software reviews):

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  It bristles with note-creation tools for drawing, recording audio and
  video, scanning images, embedding spreadsheets and reviewing the edits
  of others (although the abilities of those tools differ somewhat
  depending on the platform). In fact, its note-creation tools are more
  comprehensive than Evernote's.
#+END_QUOTE

And we begin to see OneNote's place as the feature-heavyweight of synced
notetaking applications.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  The organization-minded will appreciate OneNote's basic structure. You
  create individual notebooks; within each notebook, you can create
  section groups that contain multiple sections. Each section has
  individual pages, with each page a separate note. It's ideal for
  organizing content with a logical structure.
#+END_QUOTE

Then again, dearest Preston goes on to express his adoration for
Evernote Web Clipping shortly afterwards and he did so just last year,
so I won't really claim to know what's going on with him (he's a legacy
tech journo.) In my experience with twenty-somethings and younger, the
more committed an artist or writer is to their craft, the less
interested they are in its tools, but it's the young ones who need great
tools the most before they're able to settle on and pin down their
process. There was only *a single writer* (*3.2%*) surveyed who answered
“*when I want to DIGITALLY record something to remember, I use...*” with
“*the ‘compose' function (to publish immediately and/or save for later
as a draft) of a web-based text sharing service (Twitter, Tumblr,
Medium, WordPress, Facebook, etc.)*,” and *one other* answered “*another
text-entry field on my device where it will be saved for later*,” which
*four users* (*13.3%*) said they use to “Brainstorm” digitally.

By Question Set 3, the two alternative answers were dropped and for
“Outlining” digitally, *45.2%* of surveyees use legacy word processors,
*35.5%* use *cloud-based notetaking apps*, and *19.4%* use *the default
notetaking program installed on their device*. In omitting alternative
options earlier and including web-native CMS editors later, I inevitably
shepherded answers within a moderately-wide berth of where my own
assumptions would lead their process. It's interesting that for the last
prompt, “*to make the last modifications to my final draft, I...*” a
whole *35.5%* reported they would still be using a *cloud-based service*
instead of a *legacy word processor* (*58.1%*) or *CMS editor* (*6.5%*),
which would suggest that the functionality of these new e-enabled
methods of composition has become truly important, indeed.

Though it's not necessarily unreasonable, it astounds me to consider how
many Online users actually compose original drafts of /huge/ works
exclusively within publishing and blogging services like *Medium*,
*Tumblr*, or *Reddit*, even. We currently cohabitate a literary sphere
with
[[https://kotaku.com/this-smash-bros-fan-fiction-has-3-5-million-words-s-899629991][impossibly
massive works of fanfiction]] that far surpass anything God or The
Classics established in the past, and it's a wonder how many
[[http://bit.ly/redvonnegut][sour habits]] have crept into the writing
world as a result. For the sake of the experiment (and
[[http://bit.ly/futureland9][my own education]],) I posted some of my
recent work on [[https://medium.com/@ficklecrux][*Medium*]] and found
its composition UI much improved from what I remember and comparable in
many ways to those of more recent dedicated document editing/notetaking
services, but there's still whole set of abstract, less-than-technical
reasons not to /publish/ on Medium, much less compose there.

Briefly: instead of
“[[https://blog.medium.com/renewing-mediums-focus-98f374a960be][defining
a new model for media on the internet]],” CEO Ev Williams and company
ended up creating an isolationist community with
[[https://medium.freecodecamp.org/how-to-write-medium-stories-people-will-actually-read-92e58a27c8d8][hellishly-skewed
priorities in craft]]. Virtually all of what's actually /born/ on Medium
is of a certain soulsucking, less-than-productive quality (notable
exceptions include [[https://medium.com/@ryandeel][Ryan Dell]],
[[https://medium.com/@davepell][Dave Pell]], and work from marginalized
voices that would not otherwise be written or published.) Though their
founding principles of ad-model disruption are redeemable and entirely
sincere, I'm sure, their result doesn't actually solve anything at all,
especially after
[[https://www.recode.net/2017/1/4/14169348/medium-layoffs-ad-business-model-change][last
year's layoffs and refocus]].

As for *Tumblr* and *Reddit*, I'm afraid I've never been capable of
truly understanding either, but I did blog extensively about cars for
the first time 5--6 years ago on the former when it was one of
significantly fewer fee-free options for digital publishing, and even
then the experience was already casting doubt on the true necessity and
existence of blogging platforms like WordPress --- especially for web
development-abhorring peons like I was at the time. Now, its iOS app is
gorgeous, and its editor has ended up rock-solid and surprisingly
versatile, yet the state of its community, also, leaves one with little
reason to publish aside from a sortof isolationist desire to contribute
to /the community itself/, for Tumblr's sake.

This is where *WordPress* should outshine everything else as a pure,
open-source Content Management System for any and every use by any and
every folk with server space, so I thought I'd try out
[[http://extratone.com/shife][my own fresh, ultra-connected install]] to
see how its experience has changed. In word processing terms, its
[[https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/wordpress/id335703880][iOS]] and
[[https://apps.wordpress.com/d/windows/][Windows]] clients are
/lightyears/ ahead of where they were a few years ago, but to take full
advantage of them, one must allow WordPress' own software access that's
[[https://www.wpexplorer.com/jetpack-wordpress-plugin/][not /Open Web/
at all]]. For light, minimalist personal blogs, a WordPress site offers
much more control over one's intellectual property than Medium or
Tumblr, but it's also significantly less independent than it once was. A
quick inspection of my little experiment reveals that 5 out of its 6
content sources are from Google or WordPress properties, leaving only
one for /my/ actual server. This means I can accomplish a lot using just
their apps, and my work will be distributed among “billions of posts”
across WordPress dot com (to be found by absolutely nobody, I suspect,)
but the post editor within the CMS itself has never functioned quite so
versatility as it does right now. And yet, neither WordPress nor any of
the software I've covered thus far achieve much progress toward an
ideal, comprehensive word processing solution.

[[file:xhtml/https:/i.snap.as/wDQtaPk.png]]

That's why I'd like to talk about *Dropbox Paper*, which has been my own
browser's homepage and primary text editor since
[[https://www.theverge.com/2016/8/4/12373696/dropbox-paper-ios-android-sharing-docs][its
public beta went live]] in August of 2016, and it's very hard not to
dote on considering that it is definitively the single most useful
software addition in my whole computing life. It's a live-updating
exclusively web-based (for now) service with an emphasis on
collaboration, just like the industry-standard monstrosity that is
*Google Docs*, but it's been designed from the ground-up to perform best
the operations you need most from a word processor in 2018, which
doesn't include advanced layouts, fine-adjustable paragraph and/or
letter spacing, Excel integration, or voice dictation, but simply...
typing and re-reading and editing. You'd be surprised what a handy
productivity catalyst can become of a simple white, live-updating space
without distraction available no matter where you are or what device
you're in reach of.

Virtually /all/ of my “process” is now conducted within Paper, and I've
never before experienced such an unconscious assimilation of use. I
write about software because I've used a lot of it and I've been able to
count on my ability to find fundamental mistakes/designed ignorance in
most everything. Dropbox Paper, however, is so keenly perfect for my own
needs that I slipped unconsciously into total, daily dependence upon it
without noticing the transition at all, which has never, /ever/ happened
before. Notes can begin from blank Text/Title fields to /Brainstorming/,
/Meeting Notes/, and /Project Overview/ templates. In April, the team
[[https://blogs.dropbox.com/dropbox/2018/04/dropbox-paper-templates/][introduced
the ability]] to “templatize” any document, which I've yet to explore
but will no doubt make full use of for show notes when
[[http://extratone.com/futureland][/Futureland/]] is revived. There are
also
[[https://blog.evernote.com/blog/2017/05/05/uncovering-templates-hidden-gem-evernote/][Evernote
templates]], yes, but you cannot create your own, and downloading them
is an unnecessary pain in the ass.

[[file:xhtml/https:/i.snap.as/kn7b2Tx.png]]

Landing on the root, you'll see Folders, Starred Folders, Starred
Entries, and Shared Documents all displayed chronologically by
modification date. Instead of tags, categories, or “notebooks,” Dropbox
Paper's folders are its singular method of categorization, and they are
astoundingly sufficient, even when editing multiple documents
simultaneously or digging through professional and personal entries
within a single account --- all thanks to its search function, which is
super-swift and superior to any other service because of its profound
simplicity. It's one of many experiences which laughably shame past
efforts in the design of these tools: without any customizable search
filters or metadata and
[[https://www.dropbox.com/help/paper/find-docs][by sifting only through
title, content, and author]], any note in Paper can be found /instantly/
no matter how dated or obscure. I doubt I've yet to top 1000 entries
quite yet (there's no easy way to count, and /why should there be/,
really,) but on several occasions I've found years-untouched, untitled
documents within seconds --- a process which has /never/ been brisk or
convenient in Evernote.

Though Dropbox Paper wasn't necessarily designed for composing
5000+-word longform, it's by far the best tool for the vast majority of
the pre-publishing process (to a reasonable extent, of course --- I
wouldn't use it for a screenplay or novel manuscript.) It's rare for me
to utilize its mastery of collaboration, these days, but there's frankly
little reason to go anywhere else --- including Google
Docs --- considering that Paper documents can be bound by the same
viewing and editing permissions: by individual entry or folder, marking
live modifications with clean, color-coded initials in the sidebar, by
email or rogue URL for editing, commenting, and/or reading. (The
comments interface is the best I've ever seen by a wide margin.) Users
can be assigned and “pinged” for tasks using “@,” and it's reasonable to
assume that permissions won't ever present an issue for my own use
considering they haven't already. To a limited extent, notes can be
easily “published” via shared links yet remain editable in realtime,
making Paper perfect for obscure-but-public reference documents like
[[http://extratone.com/style][our style guide]] and
[[http://extratone.com/redirection][redirects catalog]].

From the onset of use, you'll marvel at how fucking fast and smooth the
in-browser experience is regardless of your device's age or dimensions.
Surprise surprise --- the iOS app works just as smoothly and is laid out
vaguely like a Twitter client. “Browse” --- the chronological timeline
of documents --- occupies the leftmost bottom button as “Home” --- the
main timeline --- does in Twitter's app, and “Notifications” is likewise
the same icon (practically) in the same position in both, and the items
themselves are even grouped with rich card-looking content previews.
Perhaps these nods to my Twitter muscle memory have contributed to my
own unusual bias, but I suspect it shares components with a particular
demographic of professional writers. As I understand the day-to-day
activities of a feet-on-the-pavement reporter, Dropbox Paper is a
necessity in a ridiculously all-encompassing sense. With its Slack
integration,
[[https://blogs.dropbox.com/dropbox/2017/03/paper-hidden-gems/][super
high-usability design]], collaborative modularity, ultra
copy-and-paste-friendly text, smooth hyperlink behavior, light weight,
and ultimate compatibility, it should be evangelized as a no-brainer
option in journalism. /Fuck/ a Bic & steno.

Web Clipping may be completely alien to its vocabulary, but you can drag
and drop documents in just about any format for a beautifully-embedded
preview. Conveniently,
[[https://www.dropbox.com/help/paper/dropbox-integration][they won't
even count against your Dropbox upload quota]]: “Dropbox Paper doesn't
place a limit on the number of docs you can create, and includes
unlimited version history regardless of the Dropbox plan you are on.”
Naturally, this is subject to change in the future, but I'm 95% positive
that Paper has yet to refuse any of my uploads because of their size or
format, and many of mine are extraordinarily huge.

There is a perfect power to Paper which I can only beg its stewards to
leave unmolested for as long as possible. If I was a billionaire, I'd
immediately purchase it from Dropbox and leave everything to the
company --- revenue, janitorial development, user data, etc. --- except
the right to make any significant feature or functionality additions to
the user experience, as I have never before felt this way about a single
service or program... /ever/. I'm not sure if I should keep quiet or
incessantly kiss ass, but my interest undoubtedly lies in preserving
Paper as it is. If you're left doubting my own testimonial, there are a
billion throwaway “Ditch Google Docs for Dropbox Paper” posts across the
B and C-list technosphere.
[[https://www.gizmodo.com.au/2017/02/5-reasons-you-might-ditch-google-docs-for-dropbox-paper/][/Gizmodo's/]],
for instance, notes Paper's superior formatting freedom, intelligent
footprint, incredible embed flexibility, and... independence from the
terrible Google God.

Right now, one's choices in notetaking apps for iOS are almost /too/
varied. There's
[[https://www.pcmag.com/review/346353/zoho-notebook-for-iphone][*Zoho
Notebook*]], which claims itself to be “An App Store 2016 Best App of
the Year” (falsely,
[[https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2016/12/apple-unveils-best-of-2016-across-apps-music-movies-and-more/][it
would appear]].) I recall installing it on my 6S Plus, then, after
spying some screenshots of its multicolored notes, but I failed to find
room for its use. When the (completely useless) Files app was added with
iOS 11, I played around with it for a bit and somehow ended up setting
Zoho as the default application to open PDFs which inadvertently
launched my 8 Plus into an infinite loop of “Open __ in __?” prompts
that eventually required deletion of Notebook in order to view them at
all. I tend to especially adore these programs in their early, innocent
versions when they smell most of innovation before their creators are
inevitably brought back to our filthy reality when their VCs start
expecting /money/. Zoho Notebook should have bewitched my affections,
but my short trial was clunky and disastrous and those
beautifully-colored layouts weren't quite worth the trouble, so they
were missed --- to no consequence at all.

The latest favorite is *Bear*, the Markdown-supporting app with which

[[https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/2/14785264/evernote-replacement-bear-app][replaced
Evernote for his own use]], last year. His authority in writing copy at
huge volume is notable if only for his
[[https://www.getrevue.co/profile/caseynewton][/daily newsletter on the
business of social media/]], which is always unfathomably gargantuan and
clean.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  Bear lets you tag notes by adding a hashtag to a word anywhere in your
  document; you can add as many as you like, and then browse them later
  from the left rail. You can export your notes as PDFs, rich text
  files, HTML documents, or even JPEGs. And it supports ultra-nerd
  automation, so if you use an iOS app like Workflow
  *[*[[https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/4/17414648/siri-update-new-features-apple-wwdc-2018][*now
  Shortcuts*]]*]* you can create shortcuts to your notes.
#+END_QUOTE

DayOne's own markdown support and exporting capabilities surely make it
Bear's predecessor. JPEG exports are a nice touch and they reflect
awareness of what power notetakers like Newton /actually do/ with their
software. If I had not already chosen to
[[http://bit.ly/spectreinred][depart OSX]], long ago, I would seriously
consider downloading the app on both platforms and paying its monthly
$15 membership fee to try out syncing, but I suspect Google's moderate
but noticeable influence on their design would quickly prove to be a
turn-off, personally. I had a go at Bear's free iOS experience and saw
little functional difference from DayOne --- if anything, text didn't
look quite as sharp --- but its reported integration with Siri Shortcuts
is intriguing.
([[https://techcrunch.com/2017/03/22/apple-has-acquired-workflow-a-powerful-automation-tool-for-ipad-and-iphone/][Apple
acquired Workflow last year]], absorbing it into its upcoming iOS 12
release as Shortcuts.) I'd suggest you give it a try --- especially if
your desktop-class machine is a Mac --- and for your sake, I would hope
they choose to utilize the power of the modern browser with a web
interface in the future. “As a writer, I work in text, and text ought to
be simple,” Newton opined, likely with more brevity than I'm capable of
in this discussion.

Much of anything has yet to be written about these offerings in 2018,
but I must insist both regular and intermittent writers alike give
Dropbox Paper a try. I suspect you've less “privacy” to “lose” than you
would in Google Docs, and its sublime function as a writing tool extends
from workplace collaboration to shared grocery lists with your SO and
long, image and hyperlink-saturated works like this one. It's very
difficult to break --- even by pasting fragmenting code or Zalgo text;
it's never out of date, and always a short, teeny pageload away even
across the worst of connections. As someone with an unhealthy obsession
with his written work, I can tell you that its UI is by far the most
anxiety-relieving I've ever used. As an alternative to Google Docs, I
would point out that 1) Docs supersedes Paper in sum features
/significantly/ less than you'd think and 2) for the one or two weird
formatting challenges it fails to complete, neither Microsoft
Word --- the old bitch --- nor Docs are going anywhere, and Paper
exports to both of them directly.

Curiously enough, I was required to use every single method of text
retention of which I am capable in the course of writing this piece, as
I tripped over my laptop's charging cable --- a physical connection, yes
(and with substantial leverage) because Apple won't allow other computer
manufacturers to make use of “their” ingenious magnetic charging
solution which they've included as “MagSafe” on MacBooks since
2008 --- perhaps inevitably ruining the port and leaving me with only my
iPhone and pens. I filled a few folded sheets of paper with
[[https://www.instagram.com/p/BgErFqhFvyT/][my LAMY Safari]] (which is
good, but overrated,) and felt quite ridiculous in the process. Thanks
to my fiancé's generosity, I type this bit now on her Panasonic R440
Electric Typewriter, which must still be considered a legitimate means
of writing text in 2018 if only because of
[[https://theoutline.com/post/2488/collin-andrew-yost-the-most-hated-poet-in-portland][Instagram
poetry]]. According to
[[https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00005QT7B/ref=as_li_ss_tl][its rather
dubious listing]] on Amazon, this model dates to September 4th, 1973,
which is remarkable considering its spellcheck and auto-margin functions
(neither of which I could actually figure out how to use.) If there is
anywhere to be caught clacking away on a typewriter out of preference
(I'd hesitate to call even my own situation one of /necessity/,) in
2018, it would undoubtedly be Portland, yet I am still extremely
embarrassed to be the source of all this racket and would immediately
perish if any of my neighbors bothered to track it down.

Even this very sophisticated example of the typewriting species is
limited by one's supply of both ink and erasing ribbon, though either
can still be found for sale, remarkably. I am even less able to easily
correct mistakes than those I wrote by hand because I feel a significant
pang of pain via my mechanical empathy every time I use (or accidentally
misuse) the function which whites out text with a sickening /clunk/.
There's something about this process which makes it feel more taxing,
costly, and timeconsuming than any other, but perhaps with time and
extended use, my embarrassment, empathy, and hesitance would fade and
I'd become a cruel, loaded God of shitty prose, but I have no intention
of finding out. I'll willingly concede that restored or refurbished
typewriters can be
[[https://twitter.com/FickleCrux/status/923340941129170944][absolutely
gorgeous]], and there's probably some validity in the “distraction-free
writing environment,” but I'd suggest that anyone who's pounded out any
significant chunk of copy knows that one must find a groove of absolute
focus within a word processor in order to complete work with any
efficiency or cohesion, anyway. I'm as connected as any of you, yet
these days, I always end up /hyperfocused/ on Word, Dropbox Paper,
and/or research in my browser to the exclusion of anything else on the
machine, whether or not I intend to do so. I'm no authority, but I can't
see a functional place for a typewriter in 2018.

Portlanders, surely, are vain enough to avoid leaving such disastrous
drafts laying about, though now's a good time to note that one can now
scan their typewritten document into a word processor using native
software on their smartphone, nowadays, if they're so unreasonably
inclined. Using iOS default Notes app, I could scan this physical draft
into Portable Document Format with just a few steps, but doing so would
contribute to the ridiculous perception that Adobe's ancient, clunky
standard is the ultimate end of the line for any and all digital
publishing. Yes, it's ridiculous to consider “25 years” of development
led to PDF 2.0's release /just last year/, to nobody's glee outside
[[https://theblog.adobe.com/taking-documents-to-the-next-level-with-pdf-2-0/][/The
Fucking Adobe Blog/]] (which I do believe is running on Medium,
hilariously.) Yet throughout my existence, it's been the go-to half-step
between text's digital and physical forms. The liason, if you will.

Perhaps one could argue that this role in our collective academic
Western word processing lives is profound (though no mentally functional
human being wants to meet /them/,) which would inevitably lead them to
criticize Adobe's longtime occupation of it, but to examine the /next/
significant step in the development of word processing is (this moment,
at least) extremely hellish and alarming. This
“[[https://youtu.be/LxviGskApcw][Virtual Reality prototype]],” for
instance, surpasses even /The Soul Ledger/ as the most distressing
online video of all time.

Just *32.3%* of survey respondents claim they print “*at least one draft
and use a pen or pencil to make notes/mark corrections by hand*,” not
including the additional *6.5%* who “*print at least one draft but make
all corrections digitally*,” leaving *61.3%* who presumably do not
physically print at all throughout their writing process. Our survey is
broad, rudimentary, and not entirely scientific, yes, but I would bet
these numbers would contrast significantly with those from respondents
exclusively in academia. For myself and my colleagues, there remains
“/something/” that can only be attained by physically manifesting
written work, perhaps in requirement of tangible manipulation in order
to thoroughly comprehend large bodies of information. As I've passed
100,000 words within the rough draft of my novel project, no amount of
skimming on any sized screen has enabled me to catch the typos and
inconsistencies which become /immediately/ obvious as soon as I have the
most current printed manuscript in my hands. I doubt even total
immersion into one's work via some VR-capable word processor would do
much to assuage this discrepancy --- or much at all, for that matter,
aside from casting writers into their own special hell. Surely, only the
most self-loathing of them would voluntarily choose to be so dunked.

I've nev­er under­stood why I nev­er see /any­one/ mak­ing use of the
[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Unicode_characters][vast
cat­a­logue]] of near­ly 140,000 stan­dard Uni­code sym­bols avail­able
in their social media posts, meta­da­ta, or word art. Like replac­ing
stan­dard bul­lets in our [[http://bit.ly/thetonearchive][week­ly
newslet­ter]] with ◎ (U+25CE,) --- prob­a­bly my all-time favorite, or
using strings of four char­ac­ters for intro, ad, and sta­tion
iden­ti­fi­ca­tion spots on [[http://anchor.fm/extratone][Extra­tone

expe­ri­ences feel just a bit more unique to users --- if only
uncon­scious­ly --- but I'd long won­dered if I was in fact the last
Uni­code enthu­si­ast alive.

The devel­op­ment of [[https://apple.co/2twLdBA][Jor­dan Hipwell's

describes it as “a pow­er­ful yet beau­ti­ful Uni­code sym­bol

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  UniChar is a third-par­ty iOS key­board that unlocks the wide wide

Wow! I can't believe I'd pull-quote /life­hack­er/ any­where, but here
is an iOS app that /actu­al­ly address­es/ a reg­u­lar issue of my own
in a beau­ti­ful and intu­itive way. I actu­al­ly can­not remem­ber the
last time this hap­pened --- you'd have to give me a list and a
com­pre­hen­sive refresh­er of all the ways I've used my iPhones in the
past ten years.

Con­trary to what may seem obvi­ous, UniChar's char­ac­ter selec­tor is
by far the more intu­itive and effi­cient of these two sep­a­rate ways
to use it. Even in the free expe­ri­ence, there are sim­ply /too many/
/char­ac­ters/ in the cat­a­log to rea­son­ably browse in iOS' old
extend­ed key­board. (For the record, I'd like to note that UniChar is
tech­ni­cal­ly a “Ref­er­ence Appli­ca­tion,” but I under­stand if you
can't bring your­self to use the term.) Across both the
seam­less­ly-inter­change­able gallery and list views, the user can very
quick­ly copy a char­ac­ter to the clip­board with 3D Touch, which works
so well it's as if it were meant only for this use from its begin­ning.

In the off chance you're a long­time lover and devout user of the
grander Uni­code col­lec­tion and an iOS user, I hope you're now
expe­ri­enc­ing the same sort of pet­ty enthu­si­asm I felt myself when
I dis­cov­ered it. If not, I hope you'll take away a desire to explore
it. I mean... aren't these smi­leys way bet­ter than any emo­ji? ☺☺☺☺

  So far... the only intercorrespondence between staff at Inmunis is
  people having a problem with one another.\\
  Before Extratone, there was Inmunis﻿ -- my first, relatively
  short-lived attempt to launch an online magazine which wasn't
  particularly important, but the experience surely did contribute to
  and inform my progression in understanding media that led to my (utter
  bewildered) current state. Anyhow, it's fun to look back. Here's the
  web archive's last snapshot.
#+END_QUOTE

[[file:xhtml/https:/i.snap.as/K5yflMu.jpeg]]

This, a derelict Twitter account, and two film reviews by James Wilson
are all that's left of inmunis.co.uk for good reasons -- many of which I
did not entirely shed when I tried again. Until I started Extratone and
made doing “this” -- incessantly reading/exploring the web, obsessively
tinkering and experimenting with The Extranet -- I actually had very
little knowledge on or exposure to the state of digital publishing or
the real depth of variety to be found with any significant effort to
comprehend the current offering real, surviving magazines, online or
not, yet was dumb and arrogant enough to assume that I'd seen it all and
none of it was even close to good enough for me to read or seek to write
for. I was actually delusional enough to regard myself as too smart and
one-of-a-kind to lower myself by going back to journalism school -- that
I was so special, anything I put effort in creating was destined to turn
out superb. Granted, I'd had the actual idea for less than two weeks
before I experienced by far the most traumatic, soul-destroying,
world-upturning, and life-altering event of my entire existence, which I
think accounts for the insanity, and all of my decisions were inevitably
preempted by the fact that I was a 21-year-old straight white male
community college dropout, which accounts for (but does not excuse)
their absurdity.

I've publicly implied before that it was probably only thanks to Drycast
-- which was also in its infancy during the time of The Big Event
(episode 7 was published just two days before) -- and its weekly
obligation to sit down and talk with my favorite people about
interesting stuff that I did not end up dead or institutionalized in
2015 (I wish I was exaggerating.) If there is a Gourd, let it be known
that he is fully up-to-date and brand-activated -- he sent me a fucking
podcast to save my life.

Reading and compiling stories for the show notes throughout the week
provided an early avenue for exploring and embedding myself into media.
Beyond the actual content, even, it's been the rationality in the tone
which journalists generally adhere to that has drawn me in and provided
a brighter and brighter guiding light to help keep my sanity in check
after my world ended because New Media values empathy in tandem with
critical thought. All my life, it's been very important to me that I
continue to learn the best way to both appear and feel smart and
functional. I've long since accepted that I am very fucking weird -- and
not in the wow, I dye my hair bright red sort of way which helps people
feel unique, but in the holy shit, I'm terrified of what would actually
result in losing control of my facade sort, which is actually much less
sinister than it sounds for you, and infinitely moreso for me.

This is why I still have a very infantile habit of becoming
overwhelmingly frustrated with those who socially emphasize and
celebrate their “weirdness” as an important part of their identity
because my self-perception has long since transitioned from regarding my
deviations as something that made me “unique,” to gigantic obstacles in
the way of every possible aspiration which I'll probably never overcome,
but am doomed to kill myself trying. I'm now working on learning to
appreciate those very fucking common people who are determined to prove
how strange they are because ultimately, my own self-perception is just
as ignorant, loneliness is not a virtue, and I've only maintained the
whole charade because I'd rather have delusions of grandeur than
acknowledge that I am also mostly unoriginal, and most of my truly more
“original” behaviors could easily be described as simply unhealthy.

This is an important confession for this explanation because its
“solution” is another crucial motivation behind my creation of Extratone
-- as both a symbolic and literal means of understanding and minimizing
my own biases and bitterness by 1) surrounding myself with the huge
amount young, talented people I knew with great ideas and 2) editorially
committing to curiosity as the most precious ideal in writing (and in
life.)

I do know that -- for whatever reason -- I really do have a special
knack for identifying the culture and creators that are truly fresh,
innovative, even cool among those who can't comprehend or stand it and
the heartbreaking number of those who actualize themselves by trying to
act aggressively apathetic toward the status quo. This sense is far from
100% reliable and is certainly not of a greater quality than everyone on
Earth, but I would still confidently suggest it's at least better than
most, and -- as most of us know -- it especially jives with and defines
the world of magazines.

As I did in Spring 2016, I still believe that Extratone is the best way
for me to hone my greatest talents and shed my biggest problems -- that
it is the name I can place on my endless journey to improve myself,
which -- most importantly of all -- will all the while achieve the
tightest possible adhesion to the only meaning of “original” with any
significance or real world value at all, which serves human curiosity
without punishing it in any sense. I could actually just be crazy or
completely, irrationally inverted -- and I know it sounds abstract and
preposterous -- but I promise it's my best shot at one day performing my
optimal function for the world.

The very first thing I did after I'd arrived upon these hypotheses and
been abruptly forced to cling to them as my last hope in life was to
obsessively search for a single mantra/battlecry I could drill into my
memory and could shout under duress -- including the temptation to
escape the whole lot of it -- to succinctly remind myself that I had at
least one logical chance at a fulfilling life (and yes, it's still funny
that the chance is, in fact, a Web Site.)

Scribam quid non legerim is possibly grammatically incorrect to a
scholar, but it's the best possible translation I came up with in my
Latin research of “I will write what I have not read.” It's cheesy, yes,
and a bit cringey in the middle of just any old day when it happens to
catch my eye where it's proudly displayed, all-caps, in the footer of
our CMS, and -- I'll be honest -- I don't know if I could explain it
over coffee to a stranger without turning red and covering my face, as I
once could, but it's (sincerely, in this one ﻿case) real gravestone
material. (As in, if someone were to read this after my death, they
would be encouraged to receive it as a bonafide last wish.)

If you've ever thought to yourself /wow, Bandcamp has looked basically
the same forever/, you were entirely correct -- now for a tenth of the
century, at least -- and you'll be hard-pressed to find another Silicon
Valley technology company toting a venture-funded origin story with such
casual, yet robust long-standing user relationships underneath an
unwavering, bullshit-free commitment to their product. Even under the
most ludicrous scrutiny, the company's rudder is flawless and its course
true. What at first glance you'd swear to be an unsolicited conclusion
to an obscure examination could very reasonably be described as
/cheesy/, /stubborn/, /dweebish/, /pious/, or just generally /boring/,
indeed, yet the respective accuracy of each of these adjectives are no
more than the byproducts of the very same operational ethics which we've
suggested, requested, demanded, and begged the rest of the world's
computing capitol to re-adopt, enforce, or at least /ponder/ for a beat.
The volume of the masses' exponentially-increasing attendance of late is
only overcome by its hysterical shouting match, so let us pipe down for
a while, now so that we may be precise as we dig deeper into the
methodology which has finally led to a profitable, drama-free outlying
technology organization without the need for a single drop of analogous
sweat over its brand upkeep. By arranging the company in its infancy to
so precisely and elementally align with the needs of its customers, the
original troupe of Bandcamp Bums ensured profound and lasting simplicity
in the single overarching priority for those in every single role behind
the quiet perpetuation of Bandcamp dot com: *selling good* *music*.

examining Bandcamp's history, its impact on independent music, and its
viability as an alternative streaming service, we shall excavate the
truth behind the derisive cynicism directed its way by the titans of the
tech and music press. Over the course of this super link-laden journey,
we'd consider the alarmingly hypocritical possibility that it's been
overlooked by mainstream conversations only because it has so long
operated in the precise manner we claim is so hopelessly absent from its
neighbors in its deliberate, principled, and innovative journey towards

In fact, just about everything from the shrewd idealism of those who

at twice the speed of sound there should /at least/ be some
conspiratorializing going around. Where I come from, launching a
desolate business to little mainstream success with persistence and
dignified determination is (or should be) regarded as a telltale sign
that one is running a front (according to the television, anyway,) but
exploration of this plausibility yielded nothing in Bandcamp's case,
even after I took the risk of incrimination and begged a certain
Boston-based future funk producer to accept my ginormous bribe and
include /any/ sort of pharmacological substance with his summer beat
tape. He wouldn't even send antihistamines.

As uncomfortably as it lands on the soul, no moniker describes Bandcamp
more comprehensively than “an online record store.” As far as
[[https://youtu.be/inzhStQJFQw][Ethans]] go, Bandcamp's CEO and
founders' public attaché Ethan Diamond is as good as they come: it's
quite telling that he is the only Silicon Valley CEO who's remained
intellectually grounded enough with the rest of us in order to retain
any skills in nuanced forms of verbal communication like... humor. The
closest the company has ever come to promotion? His awkward,
sub-20-minute [[https://youtu.be/MaUkS-lr-ZM][presentation]] at the XOXO
Festival 2014 offered an impressively succinct introduction to their
greater mission considering the unmistakable agony in his body language.

“We worked out of the public library for the first four years of the
company's existence,” he admits. Impressively, Bandcamp was operated
entirely as a “virtual company” until 2015.

Either Bandcamp just happens to be the single Silicon Valley company
where the executives are unanimously so fucking fulfilled by their work
without exception that they aren't compelled to leave it long enough to
stumble upon the inevitable coastal colleague with a connection to
something like The Internet History Podcast, or technology journalism

Innovation Myth, now
[[https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/24/17610348/twitter-elon-musk-display-name-change-lock-account-crypto-scams][relinquished
almost entirely]] to the narrative control of its own protagonists.
Perhaps it was inevitable that Elon Musk, Sundar Pichai, Mark
Zuckerberg, and Jeff Bezos would become immortalized as “those who make
things happen,” but our ability to quantify value as consumers tends to
scurry rapidly away behind our backs when they're turned by the constant
distraction of these mostly inert figureheads. As their personalities
have stolen the story, the people in industry with their hands on real
product have all but completely disappeared from the frame, and all of
the work remaining at the End User's eye level was abandoned by
aspiration long ago and replaced with the unfulfilling mechanism of A
Quick Buck. Though now we are proceeding into a similar frame -- only
because our subject cares more about their mission than claiming
recognition for it and might just be the first such company run by a
cast who become sincerely defensive at the suggestion of a cash-out.

“Bandcamp's philosophy has always been very different [from] a lot of
the companies we're surrounded by,” reflects Jervis. “We are not a
‘let's-raise-money-and-burn-through-it' type of company.”

I know that your mind has been trained by years of engagement with the
digital media of a rapidly-globalizing, venture capital-obsessed society
to block the passage of this sort of language across your conscious
threshold at risk of life-threatening overexposure to the Medium Dialect
and its churnalising neoliberal cyberchode scholars of the Personal
Brand; I know you've read the exact same quote from how many
entrepreneurs in how many worthless, masturbatory business magazine
profiles, but I swear on my one-of-a-kind Estonian Hilary Duff pullout
that Jervis speaks without irony or deception. how many fucking
churnicles have abandoned you, but this time, it's actually sincere.

* On The Web

Though Bandcamp was technically the first comprehensive library-modeled
music streaming service in existence, the topical conversations between
both technology and music journalists and industry executives flooding
both podcast and news feeds at the moment orbiting the “Cord-Cutting”
phenomena as it's washed over television, cinema, and music are rooted
in the same building blocks as the core technology behind the delivery
of all of these conversations as well as their subjects, funny enough.
As long as my subgeneration has known it, The Web has been a source of
sound in some manifestation, but the example with the most perplexing
history was also the first. Today, one of five tabs in the main menu of
my iPhone's native music app contains the text “Radio” beneath an
“antenna with waves” graphic which opens a service once called
[[https://web.archive.org/web/20150608143103/https:/www.apple.com/itunes/itunes-radio/][iTunes
Radio]] that was absorbed into -- and
[[https://www.theverge.com/2016/1/15/10777790/itunes-radio-apple-music-january-28][restricted
to subscribers of]] -- Apple Music as of 2016, confusingly. However,
both “iTunes Radio” and “Apple Music Radio(?)” -- along with any and all
audio streaming services (mentioned and not) -- are fundamentally
nothing more than different UX design interpretations of the “simple”
practice of streaming an audio file, which made its debut at the turn of
the century in the form of “Internet Radio.” Astonishingly, the protocol
-- still referred to by at least one person on Earth as “Webcasting,” no
doubt -- has survived nearly 20 years, and even the youngest of us have
likely encountered it in unusual situations.

Ironically, the [[http://radio.garden/][majority]] of Internet Radio
broadcasts remaining on the air are nothing more than live duplicates of
the traditional radio wave-bound products from the physical stations
your car's head unit receives. Even the current desktop version of
iTunes maintains support for streaming “audio files over the internet,”
though a glance at
[[https://support.apple.com/kb/PH19478?locale=en_US][Apple's dated
support page]] for the process suggests it hasn't crossed anybody's mind
for at least half of that history. In 1994, the publicly-funded radio
network Voice of America became the
“[[http://www.chriskern.net/history/voaFirstOnTheInternet.html][First
[radio] on the Internet]]” when it
[[https://groups.google.com/forum/?hl=en#!original/rec.radio.shortwave/2pQ9KUYmLqo/wqhhXS2k-lAJ][began]]
-- after an introduction by Al Gore, no less -- “offering digitized
audio versions of selected newscasts and other program segments in 15
languages on its public internet server on Monday, Aug. 15,” according
to former engineer Chris Kern. However -- since we're already this deep
into internet history -- a distinction must be established between
streaming static files and streaming live audio. The first relies on
pre-recorded audio files uploaded to a publicly-accessible server -- in
Kern's original case, “via anonymous FTP and the Internet Gopher
protocol,” which continues to be the elemental process behind every
audio file streamed across the Web (including those on Bandcamp, Apple
Music, Spotify, etc.) more or less because it ain't broke.

Semantically, “live” digital audio streaming in its aforementioned
“purest” form is more or less exclusive to Internet Radio. Obscured
aside from the traditional station simulcast, Web-only Internet Radio
stations have their own of
“[[https://www.thestar.com/business/2007/04/09/web_radio_may_stream_north_to_canada.html][the
Internet's quiet success stories]],” filled with quaint experiences and
an endless cycle of death proclamations which continue to be disproven,
anywise.

On June 27th, 1999, /The Seattle Times/ ran
[[http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19990627&slug=2968794][an
especially worthwhile introduction to the concept]] that likely
represents the only major newspaper's mention of SHOUTcast (the first
and likely last name in DIY Web DJing) in the history of the printed
word within a work of truly phenomenal tech reporting on Mark Mataassa's
part. From the past, one will find his chillingly spot-on foresight and
well-considered observations are bestrewed with mind-boggling hilarity
when they look.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  Dialing in to the Net through a 56 kilobit-per-second modem, as I am,
  this seems like a ridiculous waste -- or at least misallocation -- of
  resources.

  I'm using a $3,000 machine, tying up a phone line and seriously
  compromising my computing power for an experience that in sound
  quality, simplicity and dependability can't compare, truthfully, with
  the $9 Emerson clock radio an arm's length away.

  And yet Web radio is one of the hottest ideas going in the ever-hot
  world of Internet startups and acquisitions: In the past few months,
  America Online and Yahoo! each have purchased fast-growing Web music
  sites, rock-music trendsetters like Rolling Stone and MTV have gotten
  into the business, and technological improvements -- from Microsoft's
  newest browser and Real Networks' newest player to the latest MP3
  enhancements -- are closing the quality and accessibility gaps.

  The combination of developments is not only changing how computers
  (and radios) are used, but offering a glimpse of a future when
  audience demographics are sliced ultra-thin -- to the person -- and
  everybody has the potential to be a radio broadcaster as well as
  listener.
#+END_QUOTE

I only have a few experiences with Internet Radio of my own, but they're
all rampantly more memorable than one would expect. The now in-stasis
[[https://twitter.com/nwireradio][NWIRE]] project was by the most
relevantly intriguing and
[[https://soundcloud.com/themartmusic/nwire-radio-guest-mix-11-feb-2017][savvily-curated]]
home for a diverse host of electronic musicians I've ever come across --
it was my second default browser tab for most of 2017, when I'd even
listen to the odd-hour broadcasts overseen by just the automated
library-perusing bot for hours. On
[[https://anchor.fm/extratone/episodes/Juke-Master-Samantha-Carter-and-the-Producers-Extravaganza-e1neqc/a-a4674c][episode
16 of /Drycast/]], I recounted [[https://clyp.it/mps4yfyv][the absurd
tale]] of my surprise morning encounter with a Norwegian station's live
broadcast from some European breakcore club, which was likely
responsible for the most fun I've ever had working in retail.

/Extratone/'s former Tech Editor is partial to a station called
[[http://www.radioswissjazz.ch/en][Radio Swiss Jazz]], which appears to
be thriving in comparison with most visible broadcasters, and
unapologetically emits a bizarre amalgamation of tunes both
chart-topping and Seriously Obscure across every conceivable genre
(including Marching Music,) and continent of origin. Between every few
charts, the brief commentary and station identification has provided our
own private mystery: Was that one pre-recorded? This guy was on
yesterday, but has since shed his accent? However, these tiny temporary
mysteries are Internet Radio's only remaining value for us, and I
suspect the same is true for all but the most laggard laggards. For as
long as I've been coherent enough to disseminate between much of
anything, very few of its visible offerings have offered anything
groundbreaking or fresh, perhaps out of negligence (one can very easily
arrange leave a machine running SHOUTcast to shuffle through a given
library of music and/or podcasts indefinitely,) frustration, or economic
necessity.

Crucially, the truly /most/ critical consequences and contributions
provided by the pioneers of Internet Radio to our current digital
streaming experience were centered within intellectual property
legislation and advertising-supported business. Unfortunately, this
juncture marks our complete departure from my wheelhouse, but
thankfully, a few sacred accounts of one of technology's foremost
confusing clashes with the ill-equipped, technoilliterate monoliths of
the American justice system do indeed remain. As early as 2002, the
ineffable Doc Searls reported on a document authored by the Library of
Congress' Copyright Royalty Board called
“[[https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2016/05/02/2016-09707/determination-of-royalty-rates-and-terms-for-ephemeral-recording-and-webcasting-digital-performance][Determination
of Royalty Rates and Terms for Ephemeral Recording and Webcasting
Digital Performance of Sound Recordings]]” for /Linux Journal/ in an
encyclopedic breakdown of its implications ironically entitled
“[[https://www.linuxjournal.com/article/6218][Why Are So Many Internet
Radio Stations Still on the Air]]?” I would hope my comprehension is
sufficient to declare that /this was no Cambridge Analytica/: only a few
years subsequent the technology's inception, operators within the
Internet Radio business faced serious and immediate fines for their
pre-enforcement distribution of copyrighted material stretching /four
years/ back -- the severity of which the Doc suggested would “surely
bankrupt many of the individual broadcasters that have been pioneering
this marketplace for the longest time.”

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  Unlike the commercial radio stations we hear on the old-fashioned
  airwaves, Internet radio stations' primary market relationship isn't
  with advertisers; it's with listeners. In many cases, the listeners
  are the primary source of revenue. This business model is similar to
  that of noncommercial (public) radio, only the market relationship is
  much more direct and efficient. Internet radio stations don't need to
  stop programming to hold marathon whine-fests begging listeners to
  call phone volunteers and pledge money to qualify for a mug or a
  t-shirt. Listeners simply click on a PayPal or an Amazon link, and
  after a few more clicks they've made a payment.

By
[[https://web.archive.org/web/20100330102643/http:/directory.google.com/Top/Arts/Music/Sound_Files/MP3/Streaming/Stations][March,
2010]], just 374 stations were aggregated in Google's Internet Radio
Directory, and my own quick sample from its list unfortunately indicated
that most are now silent, but SHOUTcast has yet to be abandoned after
all this time and we can safely suppose the core architecture of the
internet will remain recognizable enough to support it until after we're
all dead, rendering the necessary tools indefinitely ready and
accessible should new projects in NWIRE's vein come along (I know of no
better fate I could wish upon the protocol.) From Internet Radio's
pioneer days, we must skip over a whole era to close in on Bandcamp's
origin in the very brightest peak of Web 2.0.

Again, we find ourselves in 2008 and nobody knows what an iPhone is, but
the same classic rock-worshiping, upper-middle class, white collar Early
Majority who first loved Internet Radio are now rapidly and delightedly
distributing links to something called “Pandora dot com” between AOL and
Hotmail inboxes. True luxury music reproduction comes in the form of
Beats headphones motivated by a 320GB iPod Classic. Budding audiophiles
and backpacker dweebs illegally torrent lossless .FLACs to play over
their Christmas-gifted studio monitors with WinAmp, which they've set up
to impeccably “scrobble” their history with every played track to their
Last.fm profiles. Everybody else is still buying music from iTunes.
(Those who cannot afford to buy the music they intend to add to their
libraries transition to the music nerd classification as soon as they've
sought out a way to obtain it free.) “Streaming” comes from subscription
services like Rhapsody (now Napster,) which are
[[http://www.alphr.com/features/218559/the-online-music-rip-off][too
buried in Digital Rights Management controversy]] to feel sustainable.
MySpace Music has just begun to fade away -- next year, in “the Twitter
era,”
[[https://www.wired.com/2009/07/soundcloud-threatens-myspace-as-music-destination-for-twitter-era/][SoundCloud
will definitively replace it]] as the go-to creator network -- and
Pandora's immediate future is bright -- they'll make a big move on
brand-new mobile streaming experience when they
[[https://www.cnet.com/news/photos-hands-on-with-pandoras-internet-radio-iphone-app/][launch
their iPhone OS app]] in July, but the limited performance of the
handset's EDGE network will render it a poor alternative to onsite .mp3s
for years to come.

In January, to minimal acclaim, Oddpost's Ethan Diamond launched
Bandcamp, the startup with programmer friends Joe Holt, Shawn
Grunberger, and Neal Tucker to be “a sortof WordPress for musicians” --
an easily-created, well-designed landing page to showcase one's digital
music files. As Holt laments in [[http://htmltimes.com/band-camp.php][an
interview with]] /The HTML Times/, creating an online presence for your
music had long been “a pain in the ass.”

“You need to find a place to host it, you've gotta get the metadata
right, it's just hard. So we just decided we would do that hard part for
musicians so that they didn't have to be so nerdy.”

As an address to all of their shared complaints about the experience of
online music distribution up to that point,
[[https://web.archive.org/web/20090716104620/http:/bandcamp.com][early
Bandcamp]] was an astounding piece of engineering. The quaint,
unsurprisingly crate-digger-looking Ethan Diamond -- who's more or less
remained the singular public face of the company since the very
beginning -- began a brand tradition of transparently music-nerdy
correspondence with his
[[https://daily.bandcamp.com/2008/09/16/hello-cleveland/][first post on
the Bandcamp blog]], explaining the solutions the team had come up with
in greater detail.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  We keep your music streaming and downloading quickly and reliably,
  whether it's 3am on a Sunday, or the hour your new record drops and
  Pitchfork gives it a scathingly positive review. We make your tracks
  available in every format under the sun, so the audiophilic nerderati
  can have their FLAC and eat mp3 v2. We adorn your songs with all the
  right metadata, so they sail into iTunes with artwork, album, band and
  track names intact. We mutter the various incantations necessary to
  keep your site top-ranked in Google, so when your fans search for your
  hits, they find your music long before they find bonkersforlyrics.com
  or iMyFace. We give your fans easy ways to share your music with their
  friends, and we give you gorgeous tools that reveal exactly how your
  music is spreading, so you can fan the fire.
#+END_QUOTE

The launch garnered very little attention from tech or music
publications of the time, but
[[https://waxy.org/2008/09/bandcamp_launch/][Andy Baio's interview with
Diamond]] provides a substantial, technically in-depth picture of just
how revolutionary and necessary it was. Most of what has continued to
make Bandcamp such an essential tool was present at the very beginning:
server-side stats and metadata (a unique architectural undertaking, no
doubt,) track and album-oriented pagination, and a robust,
easily-embedded Flash player.

Study [[https://vimeo.com/1739268][Diamond's first “screencast”]]
alongside a [[https://vimeo.com/1857085][video tour of SoundCloud]] from
the period and you'll notice just how much more functional,
future-proofed and /dignified/ Bandcamp appeared in comparison. As
apprehensive as I am to be caught arguing for minimalism over good
design, it's made perfect sense in the use case of /this one platform/,
which knew /exactly/ what it was from birth, along with what it would
/always/ be, apparently, which is such a bizarre reversal of the
archetypes and the relentless common narrative we know from The Valley's
legends. Ethan first shows the consumer's experience -- none of which
has changed after a whole decade aside from quality-specific track
purchases -- before delving into the artist-side UI, beginning with the
statistics tool, which included playback and search insights to a depth
that was (and still is) unheard of from a free service. Then, he
demonstrates the publishing process from upload to playback: adding
album art, setting a release date, and pricing its purchase. Aside from
their removal of the old waveform visualizer (I couldn't find any record
of an announcement of this decision, official or otherwise,) Bandcamp
has changed absolutely /nothing/ of what's shown in Diamond's tutorial.
In the next few months, they would add
[[https://daily.bandcamp.com/2008/11/26/design-customization/][custom
page design]],
[[https://daily.bandcamp.com/2008/12/22/free-download-email-capture-thingy/][email
address capture]], and
[[https://daily.bandcamp.com/2009/01/23/custom-domains-custom-domains/][support
for custom domains]]. By October 2008, they'd made enough waves to be
[[https://www.cnet.com/news/bandcamp-for-cleaner-music-sites/][picked up
by]] /CNET/, for whatever that was worth. Apparently,
[[https://venturebeat.com/2008/10/22/facebook-music-is-getting-its-act-together/][Facebook
Music]] was a legitimate property as well, but I do not remember
anything about it at all---pondering an alternate reality in which /The/
Social Network became the dominant online music streaming platform leads
to a bizarre comparison of Neil Diamond and Mark Zuckerberg which I
can't imagine being altogether productive. Suffice it to say, the two
founders' visions differ greatly.

Contextually, it's also important that we dwell for a moment on the
legal and financial hullabaloo surrounding music sales during Bandcamp's
first formative years, and the federal government's losing battle to
interpret, enforce, or replace intellectual property law for the
information age. As the Web had grown exponentially more capable and
accessible as a means of audio file distribution, it had become
absolutely saturated with blatantly DRM-circumventing .mp3s and .wavs.
For years, the quickest way to follow up on a /check it out/ sort of
music recommendation was simply to search Google for its track name
followed by “.mp3.” If the first go didn't yield success, even the most
rudimentary application of cryptography -- like substituting some
variation of “nsilmtic.rar” to find a download for Nas' /Illmatic/, for
instance -- was a sure bet for one's second try, which would often
return several copies just laying around Google-indexed WordPress media
libraries, though results hosted on Mediafire were a preferable
alternative. This was the establishment into which my first adolescent
digital music discoveries were borned, and I'm still convinced that 99%
of us participants were completely without malice. I'd argue heartily
that music's brief escape from the tireless grip of the record industry
as its only medium stumbled into digital form would be clearly shown to
have a net gain for the whole of American recording artists if you could
measure and plot it, including the past, present, and future use of
peer-to-peer sharing.

2010 would prove to be The Year of Reckoning for the fraction of
DRM-violating traffic on the /visible/ Web, at least. Though it'd be
virtually impossible to quantify, is it only reasonable to assume that
many siteowners made some real money from the ad impressions that
directly resulted from their unauthorized hosting and
Mediafire-embedding, but let's consider how minuscule even the most
outrageously liberal overestimate would be, side-by-side with the
billions in additional revenue YouTube has raked in from the same music
since assuming their place as the de facto platform for quickly
summoning just about any work of audio that's ever taken digital form.
It was in February of that year that Blogger (another Google property)
[[https://blogger.googleblog.com/2010/02/quick-note-about-music-blog-removals.html][deleted
six music blogs]] from its platform in response to complaints about
allegedly DMCA-violating .mp3s. /The Registry/
[[https://www.theregister.co.uk/2010/02/11/google_musicblogocide_2010/][insisted]]
the collective finger be pointed at the Digital Millennium Copyright
Act, itself.

“It would seem the music bloggers aren't versed in the ways of DMCA
claims and counterclaims. But you can't blame Google for that,” they
concluded, after one of the blog's founders expressed some of the most
personally-dramatic words mine empathy has yet faced as
[[https://www.theguardian.com/music/2010/feb/11/google-deletes-music-blogs][quoted
in The Guardian]].

“It's just sad because we were documenting young people's music from all
around the globe. For a lot of people, it was music they wouldn't have
been able to discover elsewhere.”

In hindsight, “blame” is an even more useless avenue of one's attention
than usual, especially when one party (Google) was 100% exempt from any
consequences all along. The alarming takeaway is not the DMCA's
deftness, but that *Google had the freedom to wait for a parallel
business incentive before deciding the law applied to them*.

Frankly, we should all have realized long ago just how fucking futile it
is to attempt to control any file traffic. Every desktop-class browser
ships with the capability to capture any streamable media on the Web
with a handful of keystrokes -- it'd take a maximum of 20 minutes to
bestow upon even the most casual user the knowledge they'd need to keep
every single track, YouTube video, and Twitch stream they'd ever watch,
100% legally without a single third-party service/extension interaction,
but the crucial question remains to what end, exactly? It's easy, but
it's not exactly a fun way to spend an afternoon. The only two
rationales that'd justify capturing streamed Web files at scale are 1)
the totally bonkers inclination that any given property/ies is likely to
disappear from the entire World Wide Web, ever or 2) the increasingly
rarefying expectation of prolonged time away from internet access.

As Bandcamp has stood so obdurately still, the mainstream music
streaming sphere has expanded titanically around it as if enveloping the
Indie platform in a surrealist timelapse within the eye of a ruinous
tech industry cyclone, which would explosively expand the market into a
ghoulish, filthy monstrosity beyond anything we'd recognize from the
rule of the WinAmp Hipster, long ago. *Today, the coolest and most rabid
daily music listeners I know all have Spotify memberships*, joining
[[https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/4/16850742/spotify-subscriber-count-70-million-users][70
million others]] globally as of January. For most, it's how they prefer
to swaddle their lives in a constant soundtrack -- at work, in the car,
at school, then at home on the television. For many, it's how they
“explore” new music outside of peer and social recommendations... or,
that's how the narrative was supposed to go, anyway. Those folks I know
who actually create music, however, are rarely seen using Spotify---even
after they've endured untold horrors in order to publish their own music
there---because the real story of its track record as a place to
“Discover” new artists, genres, or sounds is completely abysmal. When
2017's streaming data began coming in this past January, a popular
feature by [[http://galaxie500.bandcamp.com/][Galaxie 500]]'s Damon
Krukowski was run by the definitively terminal music magazine of broad
notoriety---/Pitchfork/---entitled
“[[https://pitchfork.com/features/oped/how-to-be-a-responsible-music-fan-in-the-age-of-streaming/][How
to Be a Responsible Music Fan in the Age of Streaming]],” which he began
by citing some very alarming statistics.

“*More than 99 percent of audio streaming is of the top 10 percent
most-streamed tracks* [on Spotify.] Which means less than 1 percent of
streams account for all other music.”

Why? A brazen disregard for necessary meta information, for one.

“Look now at how badly their applications already serve entire genres of
less popular music. Spotify lists recordings by song title, album title,
or featured artist name. But that information is so limited it leaves
out even the other performers on a recording, a crucial aspect to
classical and jazz.”

[[file:xhtml/https:/i.snap.as/96z3H8C.png]]

Alarming for those of us who intend to create or consume any music
separate the Top 40, anyway, which one should feel justified expecting
from most people, most of the time. Last month, The Carters released an
album on which
[[https://www.bustle.com/p/when-will-everything-is-love-be-on-spotify-beyonce-jay-z-fans-may-have-to-wait-to-stream-the-surprise-album-update-9426616][even
Beyoncé]] identified the problematic service by name. “Patiently waiting
for my demise ‘cause my success can't be quantified,” she rapped, “if I
gave two fucks about streaming numbers woulda put Lemonade up on
Spotify.” The unfortunate issue with this single denouncement of the
industry's current direction is that its source is adamantly guaranteed
a place for her work within Spotify's top 10 percent for the rest of her
career's lifetime (and probably far beyond.)

[I could now take the time to complain that she's also entirely
abandoned the city [[https://youtu.be/iiMlq8frlqw][she owes for her
career's creation]] in its darkest hour, but let's just plan on coming
back to the subject at a later date, when we'll be sure to touch on how
terribly Drake also treats Houston (and women.)]

Unsurprisingly, the apathy is far from mutual. From the Swedish
company's perspective, the digits themselves should've been dearly and
universally beloved from the beginning, and their exponentially
ballooning hubris became so inflated by 2014 that they
[[https://insights.spotify.com/us/about-spotify-insights/][launched a
WordPress blog]] dedicated entirely to promoting and discussing their
data called [[https://insights.spotify.com/][/Spotify Insights/]],
proclaiming themselves---naturally---to be “the world's favorite
streaming service,”
[[https://insights.spotify.com/us/2017/11/02/listening-diversity-spotify/][championing]]
the growing diversity in their demographics. Though Beyoncé is mentioned

Ladies” the number one female-streamed track in the world (assuming I'm

We've established that Spotify has comfortably planted itself at the
polar opposite end of the business spectrum from Bandcamp, yet for the
sake of an oblivious adjudicating layman's understanding, you'd have
your work cut out for you explaining the difference between them: both
are online marketplaces with gigantic libraries of digital music which a
listener can browse, download locally, or stream from using Web browser
or the mobile applications offered by each, respectively---and they can
do from just about anywhere, for as much or as little as they wish.
And---as the music industry and its satellites shall always remain for
the rest of humanity's reign---both are overwhelmingly associated with
young people. There, the crucial divide should probably ring a
bell---it's been a constant between cultural generations for as long as
culture, itself has existed.

There are those among us who's adolescent adoration of music is still
completely valid as a very powerful component of hormonal development,
yet doomed to quickly sizzle into casual listening or worse by the time
our post-secondary Senior year rolls around. And then, there are those
on whom the curiosity clings devotedly on: the cool high school punk
band-forming types our culture loves to romanticize, who'll inevitably
end up bald and bespeckled with a pre-dawn community radio block. These
Musicians, Crate-Diggers, and capital-A Audiophiles have historically
overlapped in synonymous functions across a love triangle of dweebish
intolerability, though it's become especially easy as of late to forget
that DIY recording is by no means a recent development---its financial
and technical barrier-to-entry has simply plummeted thanks to the
developmental progression of Digital Audio Workstations and a growing
industry of consumer-oriented audio equipment. For succinct insight into
this dynamic, let's refer to the pre-dialogue context in
[[https://www.gq.com/story/jimmy-page-led-zeppelin-men-of-the-year-klosterman][Chuck
Klosterman's /GQ/ interview]] with “the second- or the third-best rock
guitarist of all time”---/Zinc Blimp/ legend Jumbo Page.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  The only thing Page really wants to talk about [is] the sound of the
  music, and how that sound was achieved. He can talk about microphone
  placement for a very, very long time. Are you interested in having a
  detailed conversation about how the glue used with magnetic audiotape
  was altered in the late 1970s, subsequently leading to the
  disintegration of countless master tapes? If so, locate Jimmy Page. If
  a different musician obsessed over technological details with this
  level of exacting specificity, he would likely be classified as a
  “nerd,” as that has become a strange kind of compliment in the
  Internet age. People actually want to be seen as nerds. But that
  designation does not apply here. Jimmy Page does not seem remotely
  nerdy.
#+END_QUOTE

Bandcamp's core architecture was handbuilt from the beginning to handle
the “hard part” for creators “so that they didn't have to be so nerdy,”
which it, alone pioneered on the Web, becoming the best metadata
management utility for all time, but also committing to a traditional
interpretation of music mediums that can feel old fashioned in 2018.
Despite having been around for a directly comparable length of time,
SoundCloud has maintained its relevance among friends in my network as
the more socially-focused platform for keeping up with work from their
peers thanks in large part to its exclusive, timestamp-oriented comment
function, which allows for ultra-specific shortform feedback between
fellow creators and fans. This is how the company has chosen to grow its
community, which has lent especially to its strength in the most “nerdy”
independent scenes: hip-hop and electronic music. The experience is busy
by design and the divide between listener and creator is next to
non-existent---by now, the difference is universally irrelevant.
External sharing has also become a major strength since the inception of
SoundCloud's Web audio player, which was unlike any other embeddable
we'd ever seen at the time. Over the years, it's become the most
universally-supported means of embedding a track or playlist elsewhere,
though the space has quite recently began blooming with a few much
slimmer Open Web offshoots like Vocaroo, Clyp, and Instaudio.

While I can casually throw these names around for you in the same sized
font, the gulfs between the properties they denote are completely
inexpressible in words. Because Spotify went public in Q1 of this year,
they released
[[https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180502006667/en/][their first
earnings report]] in April: 170 million active monthly users, $1.33
billion in total quarterly revenue, and $5.7-$6.2 billion in expected
total revenue for 2018. I'll spare you the entire Forbes piece it would
require to comprehensively demonstrate just how cavernous of a disparity
canyon the industry represents. Early projects like Pandora were docile,
ad-free, and sincerely curious about the curatorial potential of music
streaming services -- *let's use this cool new tech to play *music* for
*anybody* with a Web browser if only because it'll be a blast* -- yet in
that sense, they've all failed entirely. All except Bandcamp, anyway.

“We started as a service to help artists sell their music and
merchandise directly to their fans, but then as the site grew---it's now
at about 12 million tracks and 1.5 million albums [as of 2014]---we
evolved into also being a destination for music Discovery,” he explains,
partially anticipating the foot-to-the-floor transition to streaming
which has indeed shook the industry the hell up over the years since.
The company's solution is minimal, elemental, yet uniquely alternative
as only theirs could be: an idealized *digital interpretation of a music
collection*, which had actually launched a year before XOXO as part of
“[[https://daily.bandcamp.com/2013/01/10/bandcamp-for-fans/][Bandcamp
for Fans]].” That release notably introduced the ability to “follow”
both artist and fan accounts, the now-iconic “supported-by” section on
release pages showing customers' avatars and optional comments, and
public wishlists. “I think it's great to use a streaming service for
music Discovery---they can be really really good for that,” Diamond
[[https://youtu.be/MaUkS-lr-ZM?t=16m11s][concedes]], before reiterating
one of the several variations of Bandcamp's founding premise that
composes his core argument: “if you actually care about music, and you
care about the people who make it, and you want them to keep making it,
the best way to do that is to buy directly from them, or to use services
that allow you to directly support them.”

Instead of the “firehose”-like experience of a contemporary activity
feed, “you've got a collection of albums and tracks that people were
passionate enough to spend money on.” For my personal use, Ethan lit up
a long-dormant incandescent bulb in my skull. My use of Bandcamp had
long been to purchase and download music files, only---never to stream
it---and there's been good reason for this. While Bandcamp has formally
supported playback on iPhone and iPad in-browser since
[[https://daily.bandcamp.com/2010/07/14/now-streaming-on-the-ipad-iphone/][July
2010]], actually using it for any substantial amount of playback has
always been a souring endeavor. Considering that it's persisted /to this
day/, we must concede that it is part of an intentional design rather
than just an irritating flaw: *multitasking between apps or even browser
tabs will prevent continuous playback of an album*, as will locking the
device. In order to move from track to track fluidly, one must keep the
page with the in-use Bandcamp player front and center. For three years,
this was the only way to stream Bandcamp on mobile, but such capability
was far from reliably expected by even the earliest adopters, then---3G
data networks were worse than you remember, anyway---and then in 2013,
[[https://daily.bandcamp.com/2013/10/25/its-over/][the Bandcamp app was
launched]] on iOS and Android, providing a sufficient fix in my book at
the time. (I'd rather any externally-embedded players I may engage with
in an album review or artist profile be limited to a single track,
anyway.) However, the app itself remained quite mediocre for years,
which was a tangible disappointment given how revolutionary their
desktop experience had been when the company launched,but not
necessarily a substantial deterrent to the sort of user they were
attracting.

I made a point to spend /a lot/ of time engaging with Bandcamp's service
as much as possible -- naturally, this included a trip back through
[[http://bandcamp.com/davidblue][my neglected, digitally dusty
Collection]], which proved a way more emotionally provocative experience
than I anticipated. Ethan's simple truth didn't really sink in until I
realized that this list is made up exclusively of my /real favorites/,
and there's not a single track that is not inextricably and
intoxicatingly tied to a specific era(s) of my life (yes, even that one
Blank Banshee album... I was 18, okay?) It's absurdly powerful---not
something I could engage with for any extended time without becoming
saturated with nostalgic gut stuff. (Listen for my upcoming special
celebratory episode of [[http://extratone.com/radio][Extratone Radio]]
to hear the best music I've found through Bandcamp.) It hadn't occurred
to me that I would retain ownership and streaming rights to all music
I've purchased---including for a $0.00 sum, as I did for at least half
of the works you see---even after an artist chose to delete or hide it
on their own page. (Though they are not retained in my public
collection, of course.)

* The Discovery Debacle
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: section0050.xhtml#the-discovery-debacle
  :END:

Pursuing an objective definition of “music Discovery” might appear
foolish -- an individual's music taste is perhaps the most broadly
angst-steeped realms of overwhelming subjectivity in modern American
culture, after all -- but its the pungent poignancy of our fundamental
human relationship with sound, itself which makes the history of
Discovery's digitization so important (and fascinating.) If I were to
ask you what you believe should be the single most important function
that must be reliably performed by any “music Discovery” device --
whether it be an application, Web service, magazine or even a
crate-digging habit -- the single factor which would render whole vague
concept inert, irrelevant, and/or completely destroyed, how would you
answer? How would you interpret the question?

It's important we do well to take a considerable moment to cultivate a
special wariness of the eggshells beneath our feet in this arena.
Debatably at least a minim more than one's taste in film, Americans from
Generation X on forward until the end of time (I suspect) will hold
“their” music as perhaps the most integral support upon which their
identities are built throughout every stage of their lives. The intense
sensation of ownership that propels this phenomenon within our culture
leaves an especially sensitive passage ahead of us.

As a wide-eyed teenager and infantile audio producer, I explored the
idea of anti-music in my own entirely Bandcamp-supported project while I
searched -- aided tremendously by my expert best friend -- for the
edgiest, least sensical sounds and scenes on which to publicly attach on
my identity in an opposing of “Discovery's” extremes with fandom: *an
obsessive, entirely-detached last-ditch skirmish between the cultural
reality and my delusional pubescent need to be unique*. This process
appears to be a universal requisite in modern youth in one form or
another, but it's important now that I emphasize this confession: I was
an especially ostentatious little backpacker fuck, but I've continued to
find my shame well worth achieving a specific balance for music's
purpose in my life, and I'd anecdotally endorse its potential to relieve
cognitive dissonance at great scale. There's only so much fun to be had
blasting breakcore cassettes at deafening, distorted volumes solely to
bewilder rural overnight convenience store clerks on their smoke breaks
in the wee hours or the bruteforce seizure of the speakers' Bluetooth
connection at a frat party just to play harsh noise or anime-sampling
Hardstyle while demonically shrieking -- eyes rolled back -- and
lighting various parts of oneself ablaze before one realizes that 1)
it's they who end up looking like the idiots for aggressively breaching
a group's fun with inappropriate tunes (yes, no matter how interesting,
rare, or underrated they may be, Chadley;) 2) by ferally manifesting,
you've deligitimized yourself, which 3) can seriously damage any future
attempts to accomplish *the fundamental drive to share the gospel of
music's variety* out of your own rubish frustration with the differences
between you.

The real, sweetest truth is that *100% of all music has value potential*
because of the medium's broad influence on the human psyche. Pop music
is amazing right now; the signature trap sound we devalued with Datpiff
jokes made us all look like fools when it unconsciously transcended our
“irony” and burrowed its own huge partition in our sincere hearts. After
my pitiful attempt to reject and distance myself from my own rural roots
by scoffing at country music for years, I've made a beautiful peace with
the childhood memories and the historic excellence of Shania Twain and
The Dixie Chicks in their mastery of both wholesome joy and crippling
nostalgia (I've even cried to Taylor Swift.) Yes, it's been entirely
reasonable all along to enjoy the straightforwardly slothen pleasure in
belching “Sweet Home Alabama” pounding cheap pissbeer on a foul pontoon
boat on the Lake of the Ozarks, leaving my penultimate irony to confess
that I've only found true and serene identity through music after
learning how to stop insisting so violently upon the worldly,
one-of-a-kind superiority of my “taste.”

That said, it's still bewildering how content we are to abruptly abandon
the substance music had to our teenage selves out of misconstrued
justifications for our classic fainéance -- actively choosing to subject
our public ambiance to thousands of replays of “the best” records in
favor of dipping even the most cowardly toe into unfamiliar waters, even
when the opportunity cost is inherently halved -- only to then have the
audacity to evangelize our dilapidated conceptions of “good music” to
our children as we demonize the music of their generation, depriving
them of a very essential rite of their cognitive development. *I can
think of little more reductive, repugnant, reckless, or racist crusades
as a model figure than indoctrinating your child with an inherent
distaste for their own culture*, and nothing more deeply alarming to
hear from the mouth of someone born in the 21st century than shit like
“Queen was better than any rapper will ever be,” or “real musicianship
will die forever with Eric Clapton.” It's unfair and unnatural: imagine
if your high school classmates had consistently turned up their
scrunched nose at the living whole of rock & roll, declaring Scott
Joplin to be the last musician they could stand.

Consider if the industry-wide customer experience standard for the
musical ambiance in 1970s American eating and drinking establishments
was entirely comprised of works by John Phillip Souza, and the most
prevalent cultural revolution manifested itself something like the
following: In countless popular films set in the time (and the stories
told today by your parents of their youths that informs them,) a group
of popular high school boys -- generally three longtime childhood
friends and a single addition from the previous summer with an Army Dad
and a moderate bad boy aura that's made him one of the school's
notoriously attractive students and the somewhat-abusive leader in the
pack. After spending some time trying to convince the other three (the
crucial moment for his case being the bad kid's rare moment of sincerity
trope) of its guaranteed social, sexual and financial ROI, they seal
their agreement to start a band with a four-way saliva slap. Imagine if
in the progression of this exhausted old tale, it remained entirely
classic (and boring) when it faded to a “THREE MONTHS LATER...” ceiling
shot of the four the in full, gleaming, performance-spec get-up of the
presidential marching band in their garage, and it was revealed that
they'd they practiced “The Star Spangled Banner” every night just to
make the girls swoon in the film's resolution with an encore of “America
the Beautiful” at an unsanctioned (and very patriotic!) house party.

Suffice it to say that it's absolutely fucking bonkers how often I
encounter “Sweet Home Alabama” (and other tunes I've already heard
hundreds of times throughout the first third of my existence,
conservatively) dripping down from the overhead speakers in all manner
of big retail stores, where it's inappropriate and unwelcome. Even from
the generous assumption that every single one of them is an objective
masterwork of composition, the amount of affection the American music
listening audience has for the same 500 singles is on par with our
rampant gun violence in terms of our unanimous tolerance for
ridiculously illogical habits. I've been sitting in a cute, moderately
trendy coffee shop on the corner of the major avenue of access to my
cute, moderately trendy Portland neighborhood for an hour now, and I've
recognized every single one of the tracks played just a bit too loudly
on the stereo. I've been sick of them all since Middle School. That one
Bow Bow Chicka Chicka thing... How very charming.

“/The 70s, the 80s... the one-hit wonder channel!”/

Contrary to the popular hipster narrative we've just defeated, it's not
the popularity of the lineup that makes these experiences so
distasteful, but their /regularity/. It doesn't take a doctor of
psychology to observe that tireless exposure to any given work of art
inevitably erodes its value, yet we continue to expend resources
saturating most mundane spaces in our society with an unyielding
regurgitation of the same brackish pop culture symbols as if we're
/trying/ to either induce a canonical vomit, intentionally obliterate
the Yelp! reviews for a distant future museum's “North America Enters
the 21st Century” exhibit, or /both/. After failing my best attempts to
elaborate with historical analogy citing a past event, I'm afraid we
must pivot to a science fiction-esque nanonarrative containing
obnoxiously speculative hypotheticals, instead.

*Imagine*: It's 2036 -- four years after we found out we are not alone
in the universe when a significantly more advanced civilization makes
formal first contact with humanity by sending a party of diplomats,
anthropologists, and explorers (who were actually getting ready to go in
2016 before getting word of the Trump presidency and deciding we weren't
quite ready just yet) who land their space egg right in front of the
United Nations' New York City headquarters and expressing something to
the tune of /hey so um... we noticed you guys moved in and we just
wanted to stop by and say hi/, entirely altering humanity's
self-perception and future trajectory (see: works by Gene Roddenberry)
yadda yadda. The visitors expressed a wish to begin a cultural exchange
project with us, and it's just now coming to fruition... I have only
moments ago made history in the eyes of the entire world when I walked
through the front door of a Target store in suburban New Jersey leading
a hovering hyper-intelligent silicon-based sphere of agender mist
(roughly comparative to a basketball in size,) who's already both
impressing and shaming me tremendously as we move by the in-store
Starbucks. From above us, Semisonic's “Closing Time” is belched upon my
life's proudest moment and my guest requests we pause to discuss it, to
my profound horror.

“The sound from the reproduction devices embedded above us...” the
android translator trails off for a moment. “It is the same noise that
was distantly reproduced 51 hours ago in ‘Miami' as I conversed with
Ambassador Phillip Defranco about ‘the setting sun' on the ‘beach,'
coming from a small open air structure which he defined as ‘a surf
shop,' which was occupied by a young male who appeared to be moderately
agitated, moving about in jagged strides as he wildly smacked the
foundational surface with ‘a broom.' The Ambassador explained the youth
was likely nearing the end of his allotted period of daily occupational
labor.”

Blood is flooding my cheeks as I listen with a building dread to the
robot's interpretation, awash with all manner of embarrassment for my
species.

“Is the purpose of this noise reproduction of a logistical nature, or is
it perhaps a common ritual within business and/or working class
culture?”

Now, it's your turn to be the human representative in this pico science
fiction: you're now obligated to confirm the alien anthropologist's
hypothesis and explain that “Closing Time” is but one piece of recorded
music among billions of diverse expressive works across millennia. You
must reverently describe how the “universal language” of math within
melodious composition has long been a hefty buzzword in the pop culture
conversations about interstellar communication and our longtime search
for extraterrestrial intelligence from the future-thrilled
90s---S.E.T.I.'s glory days -- when we felt pretty damned good about
space. The historic launch of the United Nations' “greetings on behalf
of the people of our planet” etched into
[[https://www.npr.org/2017/09/30/554489944/the-voyager-golden-record-finally-finds-an-earthly-audience][The
Golden Record]] aboard /Voyager I/ and Jodie Foster's novel portrayal of
a S.E.T.I. scientist in the iconic Carl Sagan-sourced 1997 science
fiction drama /Contact/ are among the globally-celebrated Best Hits of
humanism (not to mention the organization listed on your paystubs,) and
they weigh a billion tons on you, now---in the most significant moment
of your entire life, bar none -- as you explain on behalf of your
species to *real* extraterrestrial intelligence the reality of how
negligent it is actually is of the culture the Record claimed to
treasure. The worst part, though? The entire experience is accompanied
by a nasal-as-hell Semisonic soundtrack.

Aren't you /frustrated/? You should be, but it's not over yet:
inevitably, your round fictional companion of note is going to follow up
their query with some seriously burning meat.

“Just a half-generation ago, your utopian dream of a globally-connected
world -- in which everyone would be empowered to saturate and culture
themselves with new ideas and forms of expression -- was the defining
aspiration of your society, and yet you've definitively achieved Total
Connectivity, now, and caused the overwhelmingly opposite result: you're
all intolerable shitheads who every passing solar orbit become less and
less capable of anything but regurgitation of the same foul bullshit.
Y'all fucking wack. I'm out. ”

And there, that filthy little ball would have us all. Friends,
colleagues, human siblings of mine, *it's long-past time we expect
better from ourselves* as music citizens of the world. Even the longest
living of us are endowed with very little opportunity to absorb anything
more than an infinitesimal fraction of all there is to experience, and
we've all been carelessly and embarrassingly chucking it to the weeds.
If it this all seems excessive, there's no need to feel attacked, but
for Pete's sake... please stop claiming you “like music” because it's
misleadingly inaccurate and I'll promise never to use the phrase “music
citizens of the world” again, in exchange.

*You, your friends, and I are missing out on way too much cool shit* and
we're going to continue addressing possible causes and solutions to this
ongoing catastrophe without asking for a single moved finger on your
part because we are fucking saints. Let's come back to ground and
consider a casual real-world use case for a streaming service which I've
observed.

/It's just after 1PM on an especially beautiful Summer day in 2018, and
you've decided with your two best friends that an impromptu hot dog
barbecue in your little apartment's parking lot would be a great way to
spend the afternoon. You get on Facebook Messenger -- no time to bother
with the formality of creating an event -- and begin to bother your
group of art school friends. In a few hours, you've set up chairs in a
circle around the borrowed fire pit, gathered meat tubes, marshmallows,
and beer, and your guests have begun to arrive. The next step: retrieve
your cordless Bluetooth speaker from inside to place it atop a log
nearest the scene, re-pair it with your smartphone, and ___?/

Let's acknowledge that music has incredibly diverse purposes of value in
human life---/of course/ I realize this---and ultimately, nobody can
dictate those fulfilled for another individual by any given track,
album, artist, or genre across time and setting. Even
splittercore-obsessed serial killers and body modding cybergrind
disciples are doomed: inevitably, they will one day let their guard down
and find themselves singing along with “Goodbye Earl” on the radio way
off key, smiling like a doofus. Even if one hates humanity, they will
eventually be forced to acknowledge that The Dixie Chicks came very
close to its penultimate manifestation.

I understand that it's not /always/ time for something new for everyone,
but you're missing out on music's most worthwhile function by far if you
never seek anything fresh, and---if you still find yourself unwilling to
bother, even---carrying around even the slightest bit of anecdotal
knowledge about /what's going on/ in music with you can be invaluably
culturing to your image when socializing with youths and alien
intelligences, alike. There is a spectrum of enthusiasm (or
pretentiousness, depending on one's own subjectives) for music that is
far more culturally consequential than the practice of partaking and/or
patroning any other artform. Settle comfortably on any point -- extreme
or not -- and you're at serious risk of being uncool. Nobody wants
Anthony Fantano showing up to their party, but if you live too long
confusing the Beach Boys with the Beatles -- as I have -- folks start to
behave as if there's something wrong with you. If it helps, let's
suppose this to be the /real/ reason behind my need to discuss Bandcamp
-- perhaps its relative lack of aged or worshiped-at-scale work
justifies it all.

By this nature, its effort is designed to bracket the enthusiast as
wholly as possible, but the value most in need of its experience has
become its comparatively extravagant hospitality for the dabbler. The
“[[https://daily.bandcamp.com/2012/06/07/behold-the-glory-of-the-discoverinator/][Discoverinator]]”
(I would've voted for calling it “Genre-Fucker”) is simply /the/ most
ingenious tool available anywhere to filter music by genre, subgenre,
location, and medium. Or at least... It's too gorgeous not to be. Thanks
to its recent visual redesign, I don't even care if it's useful---it's
just a beautiful thing to play with on both the Web and the iOS app
(though I'd bet they were each crafted separately.)

Front and center on the homepage is the
[[http://daily.bandcamp.com/][Bandcamp Daily]] -- a showcase of
features, lists, albums of the day, and artist interviews from various
staff and guest contributors which I'd most certainly judge befit of a
standalone publication -- and the
[[https://bandcamp.com/?show=][/Bandcamp Weekly/]] -- an
extraordinarily-produced podcast like no other with special mixes, guest
appearances, and commentary which the company's
[[https://bandcamp.com/andrewjervis][Chief Curator Andrew Jervis]] has
been honing [[http://bandcamp.com/?show=1][since 2013]] over 289
episodes as of [[http://bandcamp.com/?show=289][this morning]]. Its
player functions both in-browser and on the iOS app unlike any I've ever
seen, with a list of embedded tracks that pop out when they're actually
spinning on the show so that you can engage further with them, if you
wish. It's difficult to describe, but it feels visually like you're
listening to a playlist in Bandcamp's normal player, except tracks are
intermixed and faded between one another beneath the host's commentary,
so the audio itself must be pre-rendered. Regardless, it's nearly as
extraordinary an achievement in Web design as the program itself is in
curatorial music broadcasting. I'm no addict to the genre, but I have
yet to Discover another similar product which I can binge episode after
episode for hours without becoming bored or irritated as I can the
/Bandcamp Weekly/'s.

To fill in the parking lot party blank with a single streaming solution
for the sake of our young, art school-attending, likely more
musically-literate than average summer barbecue guests---how viable is
Bandcamp? Truthfully, it's only slightly more suited now than it was in
its earliest infancy for obediently filling a space with ambiance. We
could ponder whether or not its design discourages absentminded playback
only consequently, or perhaps condescendingly from the high, white tower
of hipster elitism on which you'll occasionally hear it accused of
perching, but UX design is /the/ most ridiculous sphere within which to
intenspeculate in lieu of verification (gazing at you with the timeless
grace of a thousand moons, /Medium,/) so lets hold off to seek out an
interview with a Bandcamp representative.

SoundCloud would be a bit closer to the mark---it can be configured to
simply /keep going/ after you've finished a track, regardless of where
you may be within the interface (excluding the embedded player, of
course)---but it'd be much safer to spend the smidgen of extra time
required to find a manmade playlist. Letting it loose will quickly land
you on some seriously dubious (and probably embarrassing) nerd shit. As
I understand it, YouTube has long been the go-to houseparty music player
because of its universality, Chromecast support, and (obviously) visual
component for accompanying music videos, so its new, ad-free
[[https://djmag.com/content/youtube-launches-youtube-music-and-youtube-premium-streaming-services][YouTube
Music service]] has a lot of potential, in theory, but we're /outside/
in this scenario and our smartphone is our only playback device.

Startlingly, the Web's given best answer to this situation is still
Spotify in all of its culture-diluting gluttony. /Internet radio/?
Yikes. You can still find a gem of a stream every once in a while, but
they're usually unreliable and probably abandoned, so the catalog won't
last you more than a few hours before you'll start to hear repeats. You
could search out the internet stream of your favorite radio station---a
/student/ radio station, even---but those offering the most entertaining
programming are unlikely to have a suitable playlist on a summer
afternoon. So---forgetting its overwhelming financial funneling toward
its top 10% and everything else for a moment---why not just give up the
pretense and use Spotify? Again, for most of my friends, it works just
fine to play Cat Stevens, Run DMC, Gorillaz or The Rolling Stones, but I
have yet to figure out a combination of keywords to keep it on target
within even the most rudimentary parameters. Such ill-restraint becomes
especially dire---necessary, really---when I queue up “Cannibal Ox
Radio” for the office and R Kelly ends up playing, 20 minutes in. Using
personally-targeted artist bans is probably too subjective to ask of
such a service in the spotlight, but *how about an option to filter out
white rappers*? (I hope you didn't blink because that's by far my best
contribution in tech writing yet.)

The truth is, I'd probably end up calling upon Apple Music as I've been
an on-and-off subscriber since its release, but have yet to meet a
single fellow user. The girth of its catalog is
[[https://9to5mac.com/2018/05/06/apple-music-vs-spotify/][reportedly
still nearly]]
[[https://9to5mac.com/2018/05/06/apple-music-vs-spotify/][25% larger]],
its UI is significantly more cohesively integrated with iOS (which
hasn't always been a given from Apple with its music software, mind
you,) yet it costs me precisely the same $9.99 a month as Spotify
Premium would. If I /did/ know somebody else who used it, they'd be able
to see [[http://bit.ly/dbapple][my public profile]] including my
playlists and activity, just as my followers on Spotify can, and I can
create “Stations” for artists that function similarly to Spotify's
endless adaptive playlists, but---crucially, for myself---after the
app's redesign for iOS 10, the integration of Apple Music music with my
own iTunes library is completely seamless. With unlimited data, I've
selected the option to refrain from storing music locally, which further
diminishes the distinction between “my” music and the music I've paid
for the rights to stream. Fundamentally, the end result is that I pay
ten bucks a month for “ownership” of /all/ the music on iTunes proper.

While I might personally play /Bandcamp Weekly/ episodes in such a
context and gladly accept whatever results I'd get, I'd only do so
acknowledging the subsequently increased risk of some vest-wearing fuck
I've never met springing out of the bushes to accost me about Weird
Allan. However, I am neither cool nor musically literate, which makes me
particularly vulnerable to misusing algorithmic Discovery---the practice
in which artificial intelligence has become most widely-deployed which
continues to prove itself to better deserve the term “automated
wallowing,” or “robotized ear rot.”

Ironically, Damon Krukowski's aforementioned “responsibility” essay on

notes the publication's own substantial relationship with Spotify,
including a
[[https://www.webbyawards.com/winners/pitchfork-spotify-inside-discovery/][Webby
Award-winning]] advertorial series called /Inside Discovery/, which the
two collaborate to produce that's “meant to boost awareness of the
‘Discover Weekly' feature.”

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  The series shows Pitchfork editors (and favored musicians) gushing
  about their love of streaming---the immediacy! The deep back catalogs!
  One editor says it helps him keep track of his listening habits, while
  another rejoices at not having to dig through crates at record shops
  anymore. Yet another likens Spotify to walking around a music
  festival, discovering something new at every turn. What does it mean
  for “the most trusted voice in music” to celebrate an algorithm as
  preferable to its own crate digging? What does it mean when the
  tastemaking humans endorse data-driven machines? What does it mean
  when the algorithms become cool? Virtually every music publication now
  relies on Spotify media players to embed songs within online articles,
  and Websites like Pitchfork and Rolling Stone regularly celebrate
  their playlists with listicles: “Ten Albums To Stream Now.” “The Five
  Playlists You Need to Hear This Summer.”
#+END_QUOTE

We love bespoke Open Web projects, so exploring /Inside Discovery/'s
(surely bespoke) experience induced the same pathetic sort of /I wish
business just incentived building nice things/ disappointment which has
become my default, bitchy mood, and blaming as a further let down to
immediately land on
[[https://insidediscovery.pitchfork.com/playlist-mitski][Mitski's]]
[[https://insidediscovery.pitchfork.com/playlist-mitski][playlist]], to
whom I'd just been

(by /Pitchfork/, admittedly) after happening upon her performance at
Pitchfork 2017 (which is organized, admittedly, by /Pitchfork/.)

Upon a brief review of these once-petty desires and the new, apocalyptic
solutions which we are burning barns full of cash to develop, it would
appear that the overwhelmingly defining feature of those which are at
all viable remains to be the interference of a human being, and why
wouldn't it be, still, when manual music aggregation remains so
desperately cheap? I'd wager heavily that there's at least a single
editor within Apple Music who's spent serious time embedded in the
Berlin techno scene considering how regularly the prime “Techno”
playlist is updated with new work of a moderately-industrial bias.

“The downside to automated music Discovery is that we're encouraged to
develop a taste profile and stick to it,”
[[https://pigeonsandplanes.com/in-depth/2016/03/music-discovery-algorithms][opines
somebody on /Pigeons & Planes/]], complimenting Pelly in their profile
of former BBC Radio 1 host, Zane Lowe, and his new job curating an Apple
Music playlist?

The truth is, the stories that come to us that smell the strongest of
philanthropy on the surface are often actually about some dusty,
Y2K-lookin'-ass nerd with powerfully tedious grievances and too much
time on their hands. The whole world knows the details by now of how
Mark Zuckerberg's horny social ineptitude led to Facebook's conception,
but we must both keep in check the bad habit we share -- the whole
present-day reading world and I, that is -- of dwelling entirely too
much on the most “negative,” soul-agitating tales in what we perceive to
be the pursuit of necessary ingredients for concocting a better
solution. Bandcamp's story is predominantly comprised of smart
decisions, sincere transparency, and savvy ideas which are best examined
in contrast, I'm afraid, with all that's being done /wrong/ everywhere
else.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  Are my favorite punk bands now Bandcamp bands? Are they suddenly
  wanting to conform to a kind of Bandcamp aesthetic? I don't think so.
  Not yet. But if that does happen, something might be lost --- a sense
  of these bands defining themselves as they want to, which is sort of
  the Bandcamp promise in the first place. People can use help
  navigating the riches of Bandcamp. But its estimable editorial project
  opens an interesting question: When does help turn into tastemaking?

You missed it, didn't you---the ten-year anniversary of Bandcamp's
launch? Ashamed, I realized last month that I did, too. Ashamed, because
I owe a lot to to the platform's unwavering commitment to the
distribution and curation of work made by just about all of my favorite
artists---within and outside of my social network. Throughout 2015, I
hosted a number of conversations with exceptional, future-looking
creators on /Drycast/ which I am especially proud of. On one
[[https://anchor.fm/extratone/episodes/Juke-Master-Samantha-Carter-and-the-Producers-Extravaganza-e1neqc/a-a4674c][early
episode]] with an exceptional total of /seven/ music makers, I observed
in a beat that “all of us have Bandcamp accounts,” before the week's
guest, Samantha Carter, suggested that she'd found her page especially
financially rewarding, and originated the concept of the “Bandcamp Sugar
Daddy” (which I personally ship 100%.)

“It's something I take for granted,” said my friend
[[https://twitter.com/yzome][yzome]] -- a
[[https://yzome.bandcamp.com/][truly one-of-a-kind electronic producer]]
who's far-traveling composition is probably the closest Digital Audio
Workstation equivalent of Extreme Use Testing---when automotive
manufacturers effectively torture new prototypes with the most
inhospitable conditions on Earth until they break. However, it's not a
PR stunt in yzome's case---he's just very good at doing what he does
after doing it for nearly 10 years---and his end product requires a hell
of a lot more than any one genre would ever presume, but it more than
delivers back on the investment with significant interest.

When
[[https://anchor.fm/extratone/episodes/Electronic-Producer-Yzome-and-his-Alien-Sound-e1lmcj/a-a41qc5][he
appeared on /Drycast/]] in January 2015, we failed to achieve any
descriptors more sophisticated than “alien sounds,” but perhaps that's
all they need: the inner worlds into which yzome invites us are of
manic, unpredictable arrhythmia which poses an unapologetic, yet
magically lighthearted challenge to any cohesive theory. It's very rare
that his proudly-ungenreable exploration of the fringes does not demand
the listener's full attention, yet it always manages to be
/inoffensively aggressive/ like *nothing* else, which suggesting promise
for the possible upheaval of a long-upheld natural law among electronic
dance music: yzome doesn't need to be a shithead to challenge the
listener intellectually.

Play /[[https://yzome.bandcamp.com/album/yvette][YVETTE]]/ for any
boomer you know with that classically impenetrable disgust for /all/
electronic music, and you'll witness firsthand how special yzome's
particular innovation truly is. No, they're not going to be /sexually
liberated/, or anything---it's still going to be alarming---but you'll
notice that the swift and overwhelming fury which sample and break-heavy
dance music has always awoken within them has been miraculously
circumvented. Instead of immediately storming off, they'll be paralyzed
in an existential fugue state from which they may never quite fully
emerge. I've seen it firsthand. It's witchcraft.

There is no other across the (especially-wide) electronic spectrum who
can so loudly go so far, so fast without any insincerity, whatsoever.
His arrangement seems mischievous and all over the place, but really
listen and you'll hear rips of recognizable patterns playing peekaboo in
willy-nilly bursts that reveal his dynamic mastery of the dance music
space through Breakcore, Juke, Footwork, and Techno sampling. All of
this is to say, really, that yzome's music represents a level of
boundary-pushing which only a niche audience tends to truly appreciate,
yet is undoubtedly worthy of an elegantly-presented host like Bandcamp.

“Like thank god I don't have to look for a label to release this. It's
seen as a legitimate platform (by people who might actually care about
what I'm doing, at least,) which I think is less offputting than
uploading things to Mediafire or whatever else. It's populist and
boutique at the same time.”

*/Populist, yet boutique/*. Can we really be expected to exceed this
summation? Well, nobody's said much at all in the mainstream press, but
what /has/ been said is 1) unusually misplaced in the spaces of those
least likely to find it relevant and 2) /way/ more insightful than you'd
expect.

“Bandcamp has an independent-artist identity because of practicalities:
Independent artists from Web-centered subcultures need it most,”
observed an especially savvy online aside from by
[[http://benratliff.net/][Ben Ratliff]]---jazz and pop critic for /The
New York Times---/asking
“[[https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/20/arts/music/bandcamp-shopping-for-music.html][Is
Bandcamp the Holy Grail of Online Record Stores]]?” So why aren't we
talking about it? The other important takeaway: founder Ethan Diamond
told Ratliff that “the company has never spent money on promotion.” This
is largely why I've invested so much time and affection into this
piece---gratitude is not often sellable incentive for mainstream
coverage.

The truth is, the continued obscurity of Bandcamp's story despite all
it's done comes down not to any malpractice by the company (in fact, it
would likely be more visible had it fucked up more,) or even to its
prevalence in the careers of big industry names (whom I will address in
detail shortly,) but because it simply operates too magnanimously for
its customers to be taken seriously as a newsworthy business, which is
problematic and personally infuriating. In November, 2015, Bandcamp made
mention in /The New Yorker/ via the openly diminutive context of /Car
Seat Headrest's/
[[https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/02/growth-spurt-pop-music-hua-hsu][origin
story]], describing it as “a charming alternative,” and “a casual,
low-risk approach.” Granted, it's worth noting that the platform did not
address its lack of “editorial guidance” until a year later, with the
[[https://daily.bandcamp.com/2016/06/13/welcome-to-bandcamp-daily/][launch]]
of the excellent /Bandcamp Daily/ blog, but I think you'll agree it's in
poor taste to argue against the legitimacy of a /music/ distribution
platform because it's /too democratic./ Perhaps it's still just beyond
reasonable expectations to get a top-of-the-foodchain music writer's
head wrapped around the idea that such products on The Internet can
easily---even optimally---service both hobbyists and professionals.

Last year, Bandcamp was responsible for
[[https://daily.bandcamp.com/2018/02/12/the-bandcamp-2017-year-in-review/][$270
million in payments]] to artists like Jlin,the genius commonly

should mention its role in her story or---at the very least---be
hyperlinking to [[https://jlin.bandcamp.com/][her Bandcamp page]] first,
for both her's and their readers' sake---Bandcamp's cut of album
purchases is half of iTunes. From the user experience perspective, it's
absurd that those of these pages including embedded music players chose
to use SoundCloud's---which is more resource heavy (yet of noticeably
lesser streaming playback quality) and visually disruptive---instead of

The two services were launched the same year---that fateful 2008---but
comparing them is complicated. They are clear opposites in at least one
principal: how they've defined their mission. Bandcamp has changed less
throughout its history than any other Web service that comes to mind
(see below,) but SoundCloud has struggled with identity issues, to their
vastly-superior success (in terms of user statistics, anyway.) /The New
York Times/
[[https://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/06/15/soundcloud-an-audio-sharing-site-hits-5-million-users/][reported
in June, 2011]] that they'd reached 5 million users, citing their
decision to expand focus beyond “popular music” to explain the
milestone. “We're building a sound platform that's not just about
music,” said Alex Ljung -- a SoundCloud co-founder and the company's
chief executive at the time -- and its present landscape certainly
reflects a diverse offering of uses, but ultimately, any . Today, both
SoundCloud and Bandcamp have premium subscription plans for artists
which are at least /perceived/ to be competitive with one
another---[[https://blog.soundcloud.com/2013/03/11/introducing-soundcloud-pro/][SoundCloud
Pro]] and
[[https://daily.bandcamp.com/2012/06/25/new-features-up/][Bandcamp
Pro]], respectively---along with free base experiences, which we'll
compare first.

*Free Bandcamp Account Uploads*: quantity unlimited, size of each file
limited to 291mb. *Distribution*: unlimited streaming, up to 200 free
downloads per month.

*Free SoundCloud Account Uploads*: total of 3 hours uploaded at any
given time. *Distribution*: unlimited streaming, unlimited downloads.

Both offer access “basic” statistics for their tracks at this tier which
most of the creators I know consider more than enough---the usefulness
of any playback/download stats is negligible when you're publishing
within tight niches---and each has had about 5 years to fine-tune their
free offerings so that they feel as complete as possible. If you're
planning on publishing a podcast on SoundCloud, you're obviously going
to have to upgrade your upload limit even beyond Pro ($8/month, 6-hour
upload limit) to Pro Unlimited ($16/month, unlimited uploads,) though I
would suggest a plethora of alternative methods before you got that far.
Unfortunately, they would not include a free Bandcamp account. While
[[https://bandcamp.com/?f=all&g=podcasts&gn=0&p=0&s=top&w=0#discover][there]]
/are/
[[https://bandcamp.com/?f=all&g=podcasts&gn=0&p=0&s=top&w=0#discover][podcasts
on Bandcamp]], they're completely separate the platform's aspirations
and without support for the basic requirements of podcast distribution
(namely, RSS feeds.)

Bandcamp's Pro option is $10 a month and includes a custom domain, batch
file uploading, private streaming (for press and/or fans) plus the
ability to disable /free/ streaming (requiring listeners to actually buy
the music to enable any playback,) ad-free video hosting (which nobody
uses, to my knowledge,) extended fan interaction tools, and a broader
statistics suite that includes Google Analytics support. SoundCloud's
Pro and Pro Unlimited options are complimentary, but a full-time
independent artist could justify maintaining Pro accounts on both
services or neither---one does not necessarily replace the other, but
the contrast in their chosen presentations has led to a divide in the
cultures of the two communities so stark
[[http://www.thefader.com/2017/04/03/bandcamp-artists-vs-soundcloud-artists-meme][it
could be a punchline]] and/or simplified to say that /SoundCloud is for
rap/ and /Bandcamp is not/.

It's not entirely shocking, then, that SoundCloud's story has been more
present in the greater conversation than Bandcamp's. Frankly, its
largest issues are directly related: compared to SoundCloud, *Bandcamp's
community is White As Fuck* (a claim I can only make on behalf of my own
observations and those which a select few creators have seen fit to
express to me over the years, considering that the company has yet to
release any demographic information about its creators) which is a
glaringly fundamental obstruction to the project's broader mission to
help music culture “[[https://bandcamp.com/about][thrive]].”

From a future historian's perspective, the battle for the definitive
name in independent digital music distribution has already won, largely
thanks to its relationship with Chance The Rapper, who's quickly become
a “cultural influencer, thought leader, global star,” and one of my
generation's upmost celebrity champions. Obviously, there is little
sense trying to determine whether SoundCloud /earned/ his partnership or
landed their popular association with his name as long as the artist
maintains it publicly, while continuing to
[[https://soundcloud.com/pitchfork/pitchfork-presents-in-sight-out-chance-the-rapper][give
new meaning]] to the phrase “serially likable.” Thus far, his mythical
power to exude purity has felt virtually 100% airtight Last year, his
second album /Coloring Book/ made history when it won the
[[https://www.engadget.com/2017/02/12/chance-the-rapper-first-streaming-only-grammy/][first
streaming-only]]
[[https://www.engadget.com/2017/02/12/chance-the-rapper-first-streaming-only-grammy/][Grammy
for Best Album]]. In my personal favorite moment in recent popular
culture memory, the fashionable-as-hell young man
[[https://youtu.be/FkAJ_BU66Zs][accepted the accolade]] by looking the
whole industry establishment in the face and proclaiming “this is for
every indie artist---everybody who's been doin' this mixtape
shhhh.../tuff/ for a long ass time... shouts out to every independent
artist out there;
[[https://www.theverge.com/2017/2/12/14594672/chance-the-rapper-grammy-awards-2017-soundcloud][shouts
out to SoundCloud for holding me down]].” Obviously, such significant,
sentimental, and sincere sentiments are /never/ expressed about tech
companies by beloved darlings of the art world like Chance---especially
not for Earth-encompassing awards show audiences.

After
[[https://www.theverge.com/2017/7/6/15928674/soundcloud-cuts-40-percent-staff][last
year's massive layoff]], it was
[[https://twitter.com/chancetherapper/status/885921220759355397][Chance's
assurances]] that “SoundCloud is here to stay” which the public took to
heart. Even if the company /is/ destined to fail within the next year
(it appears to be as yet missing much of a verdict,) and it's all still
destined to fold at any moment, at least it'll have the distinct pride
of doing so having maintained his publicly-expressed respect and
confidence, which is a damned fine legacy in my book. Meanwhile,
Bandcamp has only made a few small tweaks to its basic infrastructure,
and added new features very deliberately, which haven't resulted in a
single memorable controversy. Aside from
[[https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2010/07/amanda-palmer-sells-15k-on-bandcampin-three-minute.html][Amanda
Palmer]], perhaps, there has never been a single band or artist who've
been known as “from Bandcamp,” leaving our only pitch to be something
like /Independent Online Music Platform on Track to Complete 10th Year

* The Future
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: section0050.xhtml#the-future
  :END:

It might seem a bit much on the surface, but in many ways, Bandcamp has
spent the past 10 years showing us what a for-profit, Web-based,
culturally-edging independent platform Can be, even in the Valley.

Though Bandcamp has embarked upon unusually sparse explanation of its
editorial directive in the /Daily/ blog and /Weekly/ podcast, but
regularly consume either for any length of time, and you'll notice a
particular savvy for Discovering technically-progressive Afrocentric
projects:
“[[https://daily.bandcamp.com/2016/08/05/a-guide-to-black-experimental-music/][Black
Experimental Music]].”

On
[[https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/19/podcasts/still-processing-tin-house-inclusion-hannah-gadsby.html][last
week's episode]] of the excellent /New York Times/ podcast /Still
Processing/, co-host Jena Wortham “I'm thinking a lot about ways in
which new culture, new cultural products, new cultural creators come to
light in ways that sidestep these traditional means and don't have to go
through the traditionally very white, very male, very cis, very hetero
hoops to prove worthiness.”

So, our greatest hope for the decentralization of the music industry in
the 1990s ended up transforming before us to become the most effectively
divisive Discovery barrier ever known to man because of its
psychological influence sub-threshold at unprecedented scale over time,
in parallel with so many other like horrific monstrosities we've
discovered in anguish to be mutants of those final salvations from our
atrocious history which we'd been so relieved to believe in. Surely, the
turn of the millennia was destined to be our final turning point -- the
moment we'd finally use our new technology to discover a truth (or maybe
just a really good clue,) that'd immediately unite our species in a
deafening, worldwide aha moment when it would reveal a general abstract
of whatever the fuck our deal was that was preventing our silent,
dutiful, and 100% harmonious collective effort toward a utopia like
/Star Trek: The Next Generation/'s, in which anyone is absolutely free
of obligation or desperation from birth to pursue... whatever with their
time.

This evening, a pack­age is sched­uled to arrive upon my doorstep
con­tain­ing a Com­paq Portable Plus lug­gable com­put­er from 1983
which I have fan­ta­sized about buy­ing for far too many years. Despite
liv­ing in the midst of per­haps the worst pos­si­ble finan­cial
sit­u­a­tion to spend $139.99 out­right on a rel­ic of com­put­ing, I
final­ly /just bought one any­way/ last Thurs­day because I'm
absolute­ly fed up with life with­out the mag­ic I remem­ber feel­ing
from com­put­ers. Yes, I am hav­ing a mid-life crises and The Machine is
just a phys­i­cal man­i­fes­ta­tion of one of my favorite sto­ries, but
I expect it will pro­vide some­thing irre­place­able for me and at least
one piece of enter­tain­ment for just about any­body: *I'm going to
start a pho­to­series of myself using the 26-lb., suit­case-like, and
utter­ly time-dis­placed Portable Plus in dif­fer­ent cof­fee shops
through­out Port­land*.

* Why Compaq?
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: section0051.xhtml#why-compaq

Put sim­ply, *Com­paq was punk as fuck*. Three dorky Tex­an techn­odads
pre­med­i­tat­ed their leave of fair, secure jobs in the indus­try in
order to bet every­thing on the promise of a sin­gle unde­ni­ably
pro-user ide­al to dis­rupt its dom­i­nant monop­o­lis­tic
supervil­lian. Unlike any of the count­less oth­er sto­ries from the
infor­ma­tion age with the very same intro­duc­tion, theirs was
imme­di­ate­ly pro­pelled into stratos­pher­ic, record-break­ing
suc­cess --- from cof­fee table sketch­es in the waste­lands of
sub­ur­ban Hous­ton nights to /one bil­lion dol­lars/
[[https://usatoday30.usatoday.com/tech/techinvestor/2001-09-04-compaq-history.htm][in
less than five years]], prov­ing that it was pos­si­ble to win huge in
tech by com­mit­ting sin­cere­ly to lib­er­at­ing the con­sumer and
man­i­fest­ing the ulti­mate per­for­mance of
[[https://www.sciencefriday.com/segments/a-david-and-goliath-story-for-personal-computers/][the
under­dog com­plex]] Amer­i­can busi­ness has ever wit­nessed.

Those of us who've main­tained some curi­ous orbit of tech­nol­o­gy have
recent­ly entered a rec­on­cil­la­to­ry process as the world has become
all at once inti­mate­ly famil­iar with our col­lec­tive pur­suits' true
con­se­quences. Nev­er has it been more appro­pri­ate to reflect on the
whole­some brava­do of the only Amer­i­can com­put­er com­pa­ny to build
a bil­lion-dol­lar busi­ness atop the sole mantra of user lib­er­a­tion.
At a glance one might assume that AMC's attempt to repro­duce /Mad
Men's/ for­mu­la with a sto­ry set in Compaq's ori­gin in a series
that's sup­pos­ed­ly attract­ed a fair num­ber of Net­flix­ers called

real­ly owes its priv­i­leged tech indus­try. How­ev­er, a
[[https://twitter.com/search?q=][Twit­ter search]] for “Com­paq” turns
up vir­tu­al­ly noth­ing of con­se­quence, and --- on the oth­er
cul­tur­al spec­trum --- I've yet to see a sin­gle well-doc­u­ment­ed
col­lec­tion of Com­paq hard­ware, and I'm unsat­is­fied.

Like it not, you're com­ing with me on a safari back through two full
nos­tal­gic cycles to redis­cov­er our won­der and excite­ment about
tech­nol­o­gy because I miss it des­per­ate­ly and I know you do too.
We're going to find some­thing mar­velous.

I believe com­put­ers can be mag­ic again.

I believe in Com­paq.

[[file:xhtml/https:/i.snap.as/qBzkbjEA.png]]/I stumbled across this
wonderful help document in
[[https://winworldpc.com/product/lotus-smartsuite/9-8][Lotus SmartSuite
9.8]] and my head just shot right off./

All of the programs in this release of Lotus SmartSuite meet Lotus
guidelines for Year 2000 (Y2K) readiness. When used in accordance with
its associated documentation, each of the SmartSuite programs is capable
of correctly processing, providing and/or receiving date data within and
between the 20th and 21st centuries, provided that all products (for
example, hardware, software and firmware) used with the program properly
exchange accurate date data with it.

*A little background information*\\
In the past, you have probably entered a 2-digit number to represent the
year in a date with the assumption that the year would fall between 1900
and 1999. For example, 4/10/02 was in 1902 and 5/8/47 was in 1947.

With the change to the year 2000, you should be aware that computer
programs may now interpret dates you enter with 2-digit years to be in
the 20th or the 21st century depending on the method the program uses to
define a 2-digit year.

SmartSuite programs use a sliding (rolling) window method to determine
the year when you enter only 2 digits to represent the year in a date.

*Notes*

- You can enter the year as 4 digits to make sure you get the results
  you want. For example, enter 1916 or 2016 instead of 16 for the year.
- Although you can change how a program displays a date by selecting
  different date formats, the program stores a constant value for the
  date no matter how you choose to display it.

*What is the sliding window method?*\\
In SmartSuite, the sliding window method defines a window of 100 years
around the current year (determined by the system date on your
computer). When you enter a 2-digit year, the program compares the 2
digits you entered with the years that fall within this 100 year
window.\\
For example, entering 25 for the year might be interpreted as 1925 but
04 might mean the year 2004.

The years that mark the beginning and end of this window are defined by
where the program splits the window with the current year.\\
By default, 1-2-3, Approach, Freelance Graphics, Organizer, and Word Pro
use an 80/20 rule for this sliding window --- the window begins 80 years
before and ends 19 years after the current year.

*How does the 80/20 rule work?*\\
Suppose the current year is 1999. Using the 80/20 rule, a window
spanning 100 years includes the years 1919 to 2018.

In 1999, any 2-digit year you enter from 19 to 99 will equal years from
1919 to 1999. Any 2-digit year you enter from 00 to 18 will equal years
from 2000 to 2018. If you want to enter a date before 1919 or after
2018, you must enter 4 digits for the year.\\
For example, assume that the current year is 1999. • If you enter
4/2/19, the year will be 1919. • If you enter 4/2/72, the year will be
1972. • If you enter 4/2/00, the year will be 2000. • If you enter
4/2/17, the year will be 2017. • If you enter 4/2/1917, the year will be
1917. Every year this 100 year window moves (slides) forward one year.
Under the 80/20 rule, when the year changes to 2000, the window will
include the years 1920 to 2019. When the year changes to 2001, the
window will include the years 1921 to 2020, and so on.

*How do you change the 80/20 default?*\\
The 80/20 default for SmartSuite is set through a single entry in the
Windows registry. You can change this registry entry using the sample
scripts available on the Web (www.lotus.com/smartsuitedev) and in the
\Extra directory on the CD version of Lotus SmartSuite.\\
*Caution* Changing the default changes it for all of the programs in
SmartSuite.

*How do SmartSuite programs store dates?*\\
All the SmartSuite programs store date values with the fully qualified
year. Therefore, dates already stored in files are not affected by the
sliding window. The sliding window is used to interpret a date when you
enter it using 2 digits to represent the year.\\
*Caution* If years are stored as separate values in a file, and scripts
or macros interpret these dates as they run, the sliding window rules
will apply to those values when only 2 digits are stored for the year.

*For 1-2-3 users only*\\
You can turn off the 80/20 sliding window in 1-2-3 by changing the date
settings in the 1-2-3 Preferences dialog box. You can also display all
dates with 4-digit years. For more information on 1-2-3 and the year
2000, open Help in 1-2-3 and search on Year 2000 in the Help Index.

If you've ever found this industry's history intriguing, you've likely
heard Brian McCullough's superb /Internet History Podcast/ before, and
it's obvious to you how invaluable
[[http://www.internethistorypodcast.com/2014/05/the-incredible-true-story-behind-amcs-halt-and-catch-fire-how-compaq-cloned-ibm-and-created-an-empire/][an
interview episode with Compaq's Biggest Boy]] would be for a head start
on digesting the story. In accordance with /Halt and Catch Fire/'s pilot
release in 2014, the broad-shouldered soldier of open computing appeared
to have been on a mini media tour (even though he openly admitted he'd
yet to actually watch it.) [His last remark -- “maybe even as exciting
as the real thing” -- may sound like silly Dork Rod conjecture, but the
show wasn't nearly as engaging because they had(?) to remove the
/compatibility/ component, which is the meat of the whole thing.]
McCullough is usually ace at this stuff, but he sounds a bit shaky in
this one, though nobody should blame him -- I certainly would be, too.
Rod Canion's accent (BIOS=/buy-OSS/) and general intensity must make
for one hell of a presence, even over the phone. 2014 was a long time
ago.

McCullough's own summary of the conversation is so thorough (he was
writing a book,) there's only a single possible addition.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  “There's a certain risktaking gene that runs through a lot of Texans.”
#+END_QUOTE

There's no other way to say it: *I believe in Texas*. Specifically,
Houston. DJ Screw, UGK, Z-Ro, Trae, Fat Pat, etc.-- these I adopted as
religion, years ago. From my perspective, Rod Canion's ballsy, loyal
Houstonianism hustle makes perfect sense. Yes, I'm afraid you've
basically stumbled into my passionate cause to unite two Houston icons.

/Opera's no-connection mascot is the cutest branding on any current web
browser. Fight me./

Yesterday, I finished moving out of the situation I'd been living in for
~6 weeks in the basement of a southeast Portland home near the western
base of Mt. Tabor. You'd see it just across from the flat Washington
Mall-ish grass rectangle that provides daring suburban explorers their
most worthwhile reward for reaching the top. It resembles one of many
local residential templates which I was completely unequipped to
understand when I arrived in the area last year. You'll never observe
any of its inhabitants outside doing any of the things people do when
they are unaware of -- or unconcerned with being observed. Walking by an
afternoon front yard “family gathering” (young white parents and their
one or two children) is a prospect of haste. Introducing new movement to
the vicinity after the sun has gone down stirs a disruption from deep
within its energy. Everyone in this town is afraid. I say it's an
unnatural way to live, but I'm just a fucking bumpkin.

As you may or may not have observed, the vast majority of my working
being lives on the World Wide Web, which requires, fundamentally.... An
internet connection. In most any other present-day first world
circumstance, these are infinitely available, but I discovered -- after
the moving process was entirely completed, of course -- that my tenants
did *not* actually have an in-house connection of their own. They
explained to me that their neighbor -- an “IT professional” for IBM --
had offered to let them use /his/ WiFi network, and they'd found the
arrangement sufficient. However, because IBM is /The/ archaic marque of
digital fascism (disclosure: they are also my
[[http://bilge.world/compaq][sworn blood enemy]],) it wasn't altogether
a surprise when they told me that his offer did not extend to “guests.”

I considered that a defined period of WiFi fasting at home could make
for an interesting experiment -- perhaps even a needed mental reset --
and I couldn't reasonably afford to acquire my own dedicated 4G hotspot,
anyway. The reality became a relentless paranoid battle for any trickle
of access -- sometimes for /a dozen bytes per second/; for just the most
basic digital communications like SMS and email -- which led to more
superstitious hypotheses about precarious antenna orientation, progress
bar hallucinations, out-of-control frustration, and hopeless fixation
with refresh commands than I remember from 2nd generation cell networks
in the Midwest, 10 years ago, or even domestic dial-up, and truly
revealed the extent to which I'd taken connectivity for granted.

[[https://open.spotify.com/episode/7wa3Ce5oJ2TNYkuknFx3s4?si=aTXoGD-SSF-Cn_HJvHFglA]]

My observations of my own behavior throughout this drought are worth
more than their mild amusement: even this petty disparity (I was never
more than two or three yards from nearly-whole signal at the top of the
outside stairs) re-sensitized my perspective to the abstract concept of
network unreliability which I'd been entirely spared since
prepubescence. Though 4 billion human beings now regularly interact with
the World Wide Web, their connections span a mathematically gargantuan
spectrum of speed and reliability. In urbanizing myself as an adult, I
have unconsciously latched on to the entitled ideal that internet access
is a public service and accepted dramatically-increasing dependence on
services that engorge greater and greater volumes of bandwidth without
any explanation but their lack of incentives for efficiency. I reflect
on my relationship with technology every day, yet I still became an
oblivious data glutton in mind-bogglingly little time.

The current state of connectivity in the United States, alone is quite
alarming under 5-year-absent examination. Mobile carriers are
[[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-sprint-corp-m-a-t-mobile-us/t-mobile-runs-behind-the-scenes-pr-push-to-support-sprint-deal-idUSKCN1L512A][/still/
merging]] and the compartmentalization of /all/ ISP customers between
prioritization tiers continues to be tested,
[[https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/24/17882842/us-internet-broadband-map-isp-fcc-wireless-competition][less
encumbered by regulatory safeguards]] than ever. I don't know my
politics on this issue, nor do I have any specific solutions, but I'd
point to the work of the [[http://digitalinclusion.org/][National
Digital Inclusion Alliance]], and express only that I hope the pace of
the technology's progress is greater than the growth of its merchants'
imaginations and the scope of their greed so that the sheer volume of
plenty overcomes even the shortest-sighted, and humanity as a whole
continues toward a more just distribution of connectivity. What I /am/
in a position to share are the revelations about our current
infrastructure, software services, and hardware devices I could only
have discovered from such an experience.

I remember standing on top of a John Deere combine's 15ft-high roof in
order to successfully make a telephone call 10 years ago -- one of
thousands of behaviors which were more abruptly and universally required
for a few years and subsequently more abruptly forgotten than any other
such united tick in American history. This blip of shared technological
adversity also led to an unfathomably vast collective mythology
surrounding incredibly tedious manipulation of our archaic handsets in
varying degrees of desperation for /just one bar/.

My Sprint plan includes unlimited 4G LTE data for my iPhone 8 Plus with
a 10GB tethering limit -- which performed so admirably in the lonely
role of my thin tether to the rest of the world that I am obligated to
actually use the phrase */like a champ/*, but the quality of its
connection is dramatically impacted by the studio apartment's depth.
From the space's geometric center at stomach-level, the handset
indicates “1x,” meaning CDMA 1x, which /is/ technically a data
connection, but certainly not in any usable sense for the network
applications of 2018. The native Twitter app, Apple Mail, Snapchat,
Instagram & Facebook, Safari, Opera Mini, Firefox, Chrome, and all
others I tested in this condition would simply timeout -- giving up
after a minute or two of repeated attempts before declining to continue,
each in their own minor variations. An interesting anecdote: in a
pertinent reflection our human ballooning expectations for connectivity
at all times, the language of our creations across both iOS and desktop
applications has recently become noticeably less accountable and more
accusatory. Instead of saying “____ can't connect to the internet,” many
of the browsers will declare an absolute: /there is no internet
connection/, or just straight up *blame* the user: “/you/ are not
connected to the internet.” (Emphasis mine.) No apologies... No regrets.

=Dude, no wifi? Where the fuck are U?=

Directly above my head's place on the bed, the phone could be propped on
the sill of the East-facing window on a clear-skied day, enabling it to
scrounge up and loosely establish enough contact to receive calls and
text messages, claiming 1-4 3G “bars,” and a single in 4G at night,
though one overcast Northwestern week basically did it in completely. If
we were actually doing something to noticeably increase our old Nokia
boxes' bandwidth bids on those early networks by turning them every
which way to find “better reception,” it's completely futile on current
devices. (I'm fairly sure I remember a network professional explaining
this to me when LTE was first gaining traction.) It was immediately
apparent that orientation had no effect, but the handset's bearing
certainly did... Most sensitively so. I realized quite early on that I
should endeavor not to spend too much time standing in different
positions throughout the space attempting to will on a browser loader
bar above a story I've probably read already. Intstead, I committed to
the very first position that indicated any correlation whatsoever with a
better connection: atop the biscuit tin on the metal rack nearest the
outside door.

It's been three months, but I'm still using my tired old Hewlett-Packard
6930p [[http://bilge.world/linux-bitch/][backup machine]], so I was very
skeptical about the odds we'd be successfully reliably pairing its
ancient network adapter -- [[http://a.co/d/ij9mfeD][now worth just
$9.99]] -- with that of A Cellular Phone 10 years its junior without
struggling significantly with range or reliability, especially
considering that it cannot run a single one of its
[[https://support.hp.com/us-en/document/c01538039][vast library of
proprietary drivers]] on Linux. You'd at least assume they'd need to be
practically touching each other to maintain a smooth marriage, yet the
only compromise I had to make on the local end was to bring them near to
each other as they paired. Afterwards, I could return the phone to its
tin and work on the laptop from the kitchen table, 12-15 feet away.
(Curiously enough, the 6930p itself shipped with hotspot capability by
way of the SIM card slot behind the unit's main battery.)

Quantifying the speed of a mobile data connection as you would a
dedicated WiFi network is incongruent because the former trades in a
much less consistent packet stream. That's the extent of my knowledge,
but it's easy to visualize: a signal that can travel a mile or two in
big globules bound to be intercepted in splashes upon the device's
little antennae, versus your home network's local, evenly distributed
sauna of irradiated mist. It's much less definite, to say the least, and
I can't actually comprehend the sort of voodoo that's required in order
to expand and maintain the networks as they are, nor would I ever wish
to burden myself with such knowledge.

I have to just */fucking do it/* --- I'm going to start writing about
music in this space. There's virtually zero chance that I'll shout over
other voices of music criticism as long as /Bilge/ remains so poorly
optimized for SEO, and Portland, Oregon has been far too confusing to
deprive myself the opportunity to work out /any/ understanding of its
youth culture. It's not a lack of talented musicians in the area --- the
opposite is true --- but a severe drought of the kind of tragedy and
trauma which ultimately give acoustic American musical expression /its
whole shit/. What I caught of the weekend's invasion with Santa Cruz
musicians were all praiseworthy, tight and confident performers who'd
obviously invested heavily in their equipment and their presence here.
[[https://joekaplow.bandcamp.com/][Joe Kaplow]] arrived with a sort of
bespoke magazine rack containing 20 neatly-arranged effect pedals,
leading me to wonder for a moment if I was about to witness /banjo
powerviolence/ for the first time, but he explained that he simply
preferred their availability, and wouldn't use “more than a few at
once,” and seemed almost genuinely perturbed by my attempt to explain
the specific industrially-influenced involvement of audio hardware in
hardcore punk and grind performance which I was referring to with the
term. (“Powerviolence” has apparently become an ambiguous one around
these parts, and I'm sure he was actually just /utterly uninterested/.)

[[file:xhtml/https:/i.snap.as/2vEevFd.jpg]]

[[file:xhtml/https:/i.snap.as/hwDHYHy.jpg]]

No more than two dozen guests made up their peak crowd of witnesses, yet
Joe and his band certainly made good on shear effort expended in laying
down a hearty, back-to-back recital for us at an unusually protracted
rate, though apparently either they, the
[[https://getawaydogs.bandcamp.com/][Getaway Dogs]], or
[[https://thecurfews.bandcamp.com/][The Curfews]] had insisted that a
“cover charge” be collected at the door of the house show. It's not my
business to to dwell on or attempt to investigate an unsubstantiatable
rumor, but I understand this could have been a breach of house show
etiquette. What I /do/ know is that one of the visiting musicians stole
4 flat AA batteries out of my [[https://flic.kr/s/aHsmqBwfDZ][COOLPIX]]
and /apparently/ attempted to jack its ancient Compact Flash card, which
is only hilarious because they didn't succeed. Regardless, it should be
said that Joe Kaplow's songwriting is more flattered by
[[https://glidemagazine.com/209034/song-premiere-folk-singer-joe-kaplow-searches-for-sense-of-home-with-i-said-i-was-going-and-i-went/][Indie
mags]] than my own ears, though one still wishes for a more substantive
topic than “I thought it'd be cool make a corn cob pipe, so I did.” Then
again, much of what you'll find at this URL reads a lot like “I thought
it'd be interesting to make a WordPress blog, so I did.” White people
have truly run out of shit to say, haven't we?

Reflection upon just about anything can have personal meaning, but no
amount of musicianship can mask a stark lack of context. I do wonder if
Indie Folk should just return to the megachurch, where songwriters like
Joe and musicians of his crew's sort are literally /handed/ a gigantic
audience of trained experts at finding profound meaning where it
probably isn't, along with great salaries, from what I hear. Otherwise,
all that taxing preparation and expenditure will only lead to more
forgettable performances. Or perhaps I am simply misguided in my
assumption that artists work exclusively to communicate /something/
lasting to /someone/. Every conversation I've had with Portlanders about
Portland music has been predominantly about what artists and their
audiences wear and how they behave instead of /what they're trying to
say/. There's nothing inherently wrong with leaving things petty,
lyrically and choosing to remain content with established sounds,
musically, as long as your work is advertised as *entertainment, not
performance*.

2015 by The Cigarette Burns</a>

Before I came Northwest, my fiancé had been exposing me to a variety of
its music, which I mostly tolerated politely. Dozens of albums and EPs
were played through once and forgotten forever, but when I arrived at
[[http://thecigaretteburns.bandcamp.com/album/demos-2015][a demo tape]]
recorded by her long time friend's band,
[[https://thecigaretteburns.bandcamp.com/][/The Cigarette Burns/]], I
finally heard something familiar, yet vitally compelling: pissed off
punks having fun. That said, I should admit that I only attended
Saturday's show because he was on the ticket, and I'm still glad I did.

After what felt like hours of drowsy corn cob pipes, Christmas sweaters,
and old sweethearts at fifty beats per minute (there were literally two
young men sleeping within 15 feet of the bands for the duration,) Ricky
sat himself on a stool in the midst of Kaplow's sprawling gear load at
2:30AM with only his guitar and his voice. Unfortunately, I'd squandered
the Nikon's batteries on Californians (the lighting was not ideal
anyway,) so I thought I'd share
[[https://www.pscp.tv/AsphaltApostle/1gqxvXNPRaBGB?t=5s][his set on
Periscope]]. Though Ricky had been patiently present and attentive for
the entire night (unlike myself,) those who were left of the
entertainers bolted to the porch for a lively discussion about unicycles
and quinoa while Ricky told us about hate, jealousy, and feeling like
shit in a somber elegy. Any further adjectives may edge dangerously
close to a half-assed “concert review,” which I am /not/ yet qualified
for, but I will say that Ricky's sincerity made him most engaging part
of the night, and his frustrated, conclusive nod to The Cigarette Burns
was the first /real/ punk sounds I've yet heard in Portland.

[[file:xhtml/https:/i.snap.as/hNtIUA6.jpg]]

I realize sharing this small experience does little to grow the
conversation, but this isn't a magazine, and *I am desperate for
answers* about the bizarre reality in which I find myself.
[[https://youtu.be/zJONjVnDADI?t=1050][When Ricky dedicated a song to
Courtney Love]], one of the male musicians(?) yelled “Courtney Love
fuckin' killed Kurt Cobain!” which was /such/ an unbelievably cliché
happening/decision that I'll surely spend the rest of my days in this
city unsuccessfully attempting to work it out, aloud. I can't quite
recall who it was last Fall that responded to my frustration by
challenging “what if there's nothing to understand?” While this may be a
reasonable conclusion, I suspect it's not one I could accept as long as
I remain here without losing my mind. If Portland is truly the
dimensionless bastion of apathy and intellectual stagnancy for young
Americans, I must /blog my way out it/ as soon as possible (for Pete's
sake, just give these kids some antidepressants,) but I'd still like to
believe the idea too oxymoronic to actually exist.

For years, I took the voices and culture of working Americans for
granted and sought to generally distance myself from my origin's
heritage as much as possible, but I've since realized that I couldn't
have done so without absolute certainty that country, bluegrass, and
folk music were stubborn as State highway ditch-rooted fescue blades:
omnipresent forces of Midwestern nature that'd secured their
invincibility with the simple superiority of their belonging. While this
conclusion is true enough for the time being, it's quite independently
so of their worth or necessity. In such conditional blindness, I've
simply proven my sensibilities to be (predictably in the case of my
seniors) not exempt. This truth is noteworthy only because of its
potential to spare others the embarrassment of blatant ignorance to
their own privilege. That said, I would suggest that you engage this
music sincerely for a moment for your own sake, regardless of your own
convictions regarding country music, Indiana, plaid, pickup trucks, the
end of the world, or the proper noun for “cantaloupe.”

As young adults, even those folks who've remained resolutely
country-minded found themselves trivializing the name of the titanic
Dallas-born trio The Dixie Chicks not out of half-assed iconoclasm, but
because their brand was so cleverly immune to irony. You thought you
were proving yourself of a higher caliber of discernment, but mocking
goddesses only paraded your ignorance. In my teen rebellion against the
culture of my rural origin, I scoffed at their mention for a while,
somehow oblivious to my blatant hypocrisy. Thanks to my older sisters
and their automobiles, I spent before and after elementary school days
absorbing thousands of hours' worth of late-90s/early-oughts Pop Country
radio. Two summers ago, I returned to this library at length for the
first time in 10 years and found my heart completely vulnerable to its
related memories and my mind consistently flabbergasted by the oomph of
the composition that defines the genre's last mainstream hurrah.

The original three Chicks -- Natalie Maines, Emily Robison, and Marty
Maguire -- are still very much alive, kicking, and radio-playing. They
even
“[[https://www.tennessean.com/story/entertainment/music/2016/08/16/dixie-chicks-long-road-back-exile/88762752/][returned
from exile]]” with a real international tour in 2016. (I regret little
more in my adult life than missing the opportunity to see them.)
According to
[[https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/nov/19/the-dixie-chicks-tour-is-country-music-ready-to-forgive][a
fascinating November 2015 analysis]] in The Guardian, their 2003
denouncement of President George W. Bush cost them serious cred among
their audience, but Johnny Cash likely
[[https://www.thenation.com/article/johnny-cash-was-not-republican][harbored
similar sentiments]], Stephen Morrissey is...
[[https://web.archive.org/web/20131024020237/http:/true-to-you.net/morrissey_news_131019_01][not
straight]], the most worthwhile current country sounds from my teenage
home are [[https://cowgirljordy.bandcamp.com/][composed and performed by
a trans woman]], and the staple tunes from the genre's most chaste
personalities are often [[https://youtu.be/yCmsZUN4r_s][just about
sex]]. No reasonable individual would still cite this incident in an
argument opposing the essential legacy of these three miraculously
talented women.

From a pop perspective at least, The Dixie Chicks are almost certainly
the penultimate expression of country music as a technical and emotional
exercise. Their extraordinary musicianship and prodigally antecedent
mastery of suave sincerity represented the absolute peak of pop
country's untenable relationship with the American working class in one
hell of a 21st-century-breaching last hurrah that still brings tears of
pride to many an eye. However, the hysterical backlash of the greater
working people personified in part by Donald Trump's presidency is a
last sure indication of the mainstream's final estrangement from all
distillations of rural culture. In the coming years, I fear the toiling
masses will be left only with less and less authentic, more and more
suburban bastardizations of their music as the last superficial
delusions of condescending affection from the middle class fade, and the
enterprise dies. What does survive will “graduate” (retire) to Folk (for
white performers,) and further strengthen the Blues resurrection (for
everyone else.) That said, it's hard to find anyone who's comfortable
mourning the loss openly after acceptance has progressively set in --
there's simply nowhere else to go, and its aging icons have been in
desperate need of retirement throughout the Information Age.

Even if I'd had the moderate exposure from my current perch in the midst
of the notoriously grass-roots nature of Portland's Folk/Blues scene,
2000 miles west, I would have still been totally blindsided by my
incidental introduction to The Matchsellers, two years ago. One needn't
harbor any presumptions about the relationship between Kansas City
violinist/fiddler Julie Bates and Hoosier blues guitarist, Andrew Morris
-- they're just about the cutest pair you'll ever see, couple's act or
not (it's less relevant than you'd think, and none of our business.)
They're also extremely talented and genuinely authoritative world-class
musicians with plenty of authentic country mileage who exude a proud air
of warm, confident serenity occupying the bluegrass sphere. After
happening upon their set at Columbia's faux-speakeasy in Summer 2016, I
was at once charmed and impressed by the pervasive magnitude of the
ethereal aura that followed them, especially after our brief
post-performance conversation. I'm ninety percent sure they came without
a mobile phone between them carrying a wicker basket full of CDs and
matchbooks, and shucks... I do believe we've been doing this whole thing
wrong, all along.

County by The Matchsellers</a>

#+BEGIN_HTML
  </iframe>
#+END_HTML

I bought a copy of
[[https://thematchsellers.bandcamp.com/album/kosciusko-county][Kosciusko
County]] then and there and played the shit out of it the next summer,
wandering aimlessly around Missouri with my best friend, revisiting (and
occasionally disrupting) the resolute peace of the tiny communities I
grew up orbiting. On our way to the Hannibal -- Huckleberry's Fictional
home/the great Mississippi's tired tourism machine -- we just left it on
repeat. As a soundtrack to such sentimental pursuits, a central trio of
back-to-back tracks proved especially potent, beginning with
“[[https://thematchsellers.bandcamp.com/track/mentone-the-3000-lb-egg][Mentone
(The 3,000 lb Egg)]]” -- the work's nostalgic, tear-jerking sole
instrumental. Production isn't low-fidelity, but appropriately honest --
no amount of expensive mastering would be capable of compressing the
essence of a surprise late-night live performance from The Matchsellers'
work into a digital audio file, anyway.

Bates' fiddling is an impossibly rare pleasure -- the real type of
sawing that mystically manages to erase one's inhibitions and sense of
civic responsibility when tearing about the borders of quiet row-crop
plots, leaving long-lived lesions of billowing limestone high above
numbered county roads at ninety miles-per-hour. Succeeding the distant,
eye-misting cruise of the 1.5-ton Egg,
“[[https://thematchsellers.bandcamp.com/track/driving-escort][Driving
Escort]]” is a masterpiece (naturally) of this raucous realm.

/Driving down the road with a yellow light on top of my truck / Going
down to Vincennes earning my sixty bucks./

Add the accompaniment of Morris' obviously-fathomless relationship with
the guitar, and the result nails a select truth without any hint of
prudishness. At sufficient volume,
“[[https://thematchsellers.bandcamp.com/track/muskmelon-breakdown][Muskmelon
Breakdown]]” becomes a beautifully-harmonious catalyst of fast, loose,
maniacal, hilarious energy that's sure to land you in a ditch, but
you'll still be laughing your ass off by the time you're pulling clay
clumps and waist-high fescue blades from your steaming radiator.
/Kosciusko County/ isn't an innovative record by any critical
instrumentation, but I'd do best to keep my sun-faded, skip-worn copy
readily at hand for the next time I find myself on a fresh gravel road,
whenever that may be.

That's it, then -- we've got The Matchsellers pretty well figured for
either wannabe(?) or reformed(?) yahoos of their own design; charming,
dusty novelties who chose a folly destiny of toiling their craft for
none but a seasonal dozen acres of white, sweating State Fair flesh.
Obviously, they're meant for us sophisticated, globetrotting Winners to
collect like thrift store antiques on our way down the interstate. Their
time is ours to book for nothing on our mediocre “speakeasy's” waxy new
stage; to post on an Instagram story, to Tweet in an easy
compartmentalization of their quaint displacement from our time, deep in
the dusty recesses of our collections for no good bargain, where they'll
fall comfortably in line as our predictable and willing country servants
should an opportunity happen upon us to show a stranger how interesting,
dynamic, and worldly we are.

As a displaced (and formerly ex-communicated) yokel, I've often been
astonished by how easy it is to discard American folk music for huge
swaths of time unless it expresses some unignorable sort of spectacular
torment. My own failure to recognize the value in this one until I
became separated and homesick was an overtly foolhardy cliché (though
quite predictable of like privilege,) but I can't help but wonder: *is
it unavoidable?* Of course, the process is necessary for ‘class justice'
-- one might even call it a natural law of sorts -- and in the case of
The Matchsellers, there's hardly a struggle to communicate emotionally.
For a real music scholar, though, it's surely worth asking of those
voices who know: do the oppressed, destitute, and hope-impoverished
people of this country still rely on bluegrass, or has it been replaced
for them?

The abstraction of the phrase “good surprise” had plummeted from our
collective vocabulary at a record-demolishing velocity in the interim,
but this past spring's release of
[[https://thematchsellers.bandcamp.com/album/bluegrastronauts][/Bluegrastronauts/]]
hit me squarely upside the skull again, stirring a solid half hour of
hysterical, shrieking psychosis. I assumed the worst... /Dear God, what
has the internet forced upon that sweet, rootsy duo/?! -- and was
immediately compelled to drop everything and listen.

/Hoosiers, we have a problem/. What the fuck is this album, exactly? A
nonchalant, apparently oblivious challenge to every assumption you could
possibly arrive with. It's safe to suppose “Bluegrastronauts” refers to
its departure from the rest of their discography -- from smack dab in
Indiana's center to the goddamned Beta Quadrant, the two managed to
stupefyingly ace a theme most comfortable residents of their bluegrass
sphere would take care to avoid leaving up on the kitchen whiteboard --
even tackling apocalypse with regal serenity. At first glance, I was
sure that copious soft glow had to either be the false product of my own
insanity, or a deliberate attempt to alienate the sum of their audience
in a single crises of identity. In fact, The Matchsellers had pulled off
yet another especially-sparse artistic miracle and harnessed their
creative restlessness to propel their departure from the elderly genre's
pretensions without spilling a single drip of their secret sauce. It's
not a concept album (thank God,) but doesn't wander in any disparaging
sense, either.

Name-dropping four bluegrass legends within the number 1 album-titled
introductory track is the pair's single self-conscious acknowledgment of
visiting folk fanatics: this CD looks crazy, but we know what we're
doing -- and Kansas City's mention accredits the locale of the following
entirely Missouri-made production. Indeed, in the WhoDoneIts, you'll see
The HillBenders' [[https://www.instagram.com/p/Bfwh-rmhcet/][Chad

[[https://deadhorsesoundcompany.com/][Dead Horse Sound Company]] spread
em' around in the Heart of America, itself. Missourian musicians
especially should take note of these names: the offerings may have
diversified since my day, but sound talent like this is difficult to
come across, even within explosive college towns. Cutting two live
acoustic tracks per performer -- four in total -- while expecting to
retain any subsequent control over the behavior of either unwanted or
subject sound is as difficult as any other circumstance you'll encounter
in studio production at this level. I know this much (but little more in
that direction): real sound control is simply too tedious to bear for
monomiking rascals with GarageBand. Now, having lost or been estranged
from any remotely-professional sound reproduction equipment,
/Bluegrastronauts/ sounds as balanced and polished as my wired Apple
earbuds could ever convey.

In shared verses, Julie and Andrew's charmed harmonies are separated
beautifully about the listener without inducing a sense of lateral
imbalance when one of them sings alone. (Admittedly, I don't exactly
know how it's accomplished.) No single personality in the record's
toolset -- guitar, fiddle, banjo, bass, or dobro steps over any other.

I have no idea who's listening, but I'm positive their numbers should be
multiplying by a hundredfold very quickly, filling especially with all
of ye who feel abandoned by all authentic American representation. They
shouldn't ever fill up stadiums or establishment radiowaves, nor should
their art invite extensive pretentious dissection, but they will be
adored.

It's a quintessential manner of Country Boy pride to whip the middle
class's condescension right back around with a classic demonstration:
Oh, you thought I didn't know about that? You thought I couldn't /do/
that? Well, of course I can! I'm just not particularly interested. The
Matchsellers, though, have attained a much higher tier of comfort and
confidence in their own skin.

Ten percent of the United States' adult population cannot functionally
read or write ([[http://literacy.kent.edu/][conservatively]]) despite
the exponential increase of required reading in the average American's
day-to-day life thus far in the 21stcentury. For written American media,
especially, one would assume that a financial and social incentive for
maximum literacy in the populace should present a straightforward
justification for intense widespread coverage of this particular
disparity, yet most related coverage in mainstream national magazines
and newspapers is alarmingly sparse and often requires a
less-than-socially-conscious context (e.g. a
[[https://www.fastcompany.com/90259739/this-mobile-learning-platform-aims-to-combat-the-hidden-epidemic-of-adult-illiteracy][for-profit
startup]]) to actually appear in news feeds. From the most wholesome
assumption of the industry's general values --- that it holds
“[[https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/newsworthy][newsworthiness]]”
above all --- we must assume that it does not generally consider
American illiteracy “interesting enough to the general public to warrant
reporting” as we examine the intermittent discourse surrounding the
issue that /does/ achieve publication.

In late October, the American business and technology magazine /Fast
Company/ covered the recent successes of the “for-profit social
enterprise” Cell-Ed, noting that “a huge portion of the American labor
force is illiterate,” which it described as “a hidden epidemic.” The
article's author, Rick Wartzman, mentions foremost that Cell-Ed's
userbase is largely “foreign-born” and expected to eclipse one million
in number by the end of 2019. Demographically, the magazine's readership
is predominantly middle to upper-class, who are the least affected
social groups by a significant margin as per illiteracy's strong
correlative relationship with poverty. These factors combine to limit
any real social consequences from such an article.

In direct contrast with the professional, market-minded perspective of
modern business magazine, even niche independent publications from the
opposite end of the media spectrum often trivialize, belittle, or
generally mishandle the issue. In
[[https://www.baptiststandard.com/opinion/editorials/if-you-can-read-this-be-thankful/][a
500-word “Editorial”]] written by /The/ Editor
[[https://twitter.com/EricBlackBSP][Eric Black]] of the /Baptist
Standard/ --- a small evangelical news website describing itself as
“Baptist voices speaking to the challenges of today's world” --- he
points to a /global/ increase in “illiterate people,” as he so
comfortably brands them. Such language is inevitably counter-productive
and potentially insensitive: to the eyes and ears of activists,
educators, and the general public, such a term unnecessarily lends
toward a restricted perspective of those people who have been left
behind by the institution of read and written language in one manner or
another and portrays them as a great vague collection of lingual lepers
bearing their own distinct, inexorable, wordless ethnicity which
/inevitably/ bars them from the freedoms allowed by the Editor's learned
capacity, including the ability to actually read his words of
affliction. Simply put, he has dangerously oversimplified the issue.

To once again assume the best and infer that Black had a specific
purpose in publishing his ill-supported opinion beyond continuity's sake
of [[https://www.baptiststandard.com/opinion/editorials/][his weekly
Editorials]], it appears to be the promotion of a local Texan literacy
“ministry” called [[http://www.literacyconnexus.org/][Literacy
Connexus]], though no further specifics about the project are provided
beyond “helping churches develop literacy programs for their
communities, provide training and resources to overcome illiteracy,”
which is virtually identical to the introductory copy on
[[http://www.literacyconnexus.org/][the organization's homepage]].

So far, we've examined coverage only in special interest media, but what
about legacy news organizations with the largest readerships in the
United States? Despite oblivious use of the same ledes, a newspaper like
/The Washington Post/ can wield vast influence over the broadest
possible readership and the public editorial trust. In November 2016,
veteran reporter Valerie Strauss published
“[[https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/answer-sheet/wp/2016/11/01/hiding-in-plain-sight-the-adult-literacy-crisis/][Hiding
in plain sight: The adult literacy crisis]]” for /Answer Sheet/ --- her
weekly newsletter designed to function as “a school survival guide for
parents (and everyone else), from education policy to psychology” ---
which represents the most substantial discussion of American illiteracy
in topical, widely-visible media (i.e. presence in a succinct search
engine query.) She briefly introduces the issue with a bulleted list of
illiteracy's consequences on modern society and the individual cited
from a [[https://www.fondationalphabetisation.org/en/][Canadian literacy
foundation]] before turning the stage over to
[[https://aohdc.org/about-us/staff/lecester-johnson-chief-executive-officer/][Lecester
Johnson]], CEO of the
[[https://aohdc.org/about-us/staff/lecester-johnson-chief-executive-officer/][Academy
of Hope Adult Public Charter School]] in Washington D.C.

Johnson presents a passionate and well-informed exploration of the state
of the literacy battle from the perspective of a full-time, locally
on-the-ground advocate. Her op-ed's introduction includes the most
essential observations and statistics throughout, noting “the children
of parents with low literacy skills are more likely to live in poverty
as adults and are five times more likely to drop out of school,” before
setting upon a detailed examination of current and relevant
organizations working toward /solutions/. Of course, it's largely
centered upon her own organization, which she claims has “helped more
than 6000 adults rebuild their education and job opportunities since
1985.”

It's significant that an institution as deeply embedded across the
American political spectrum as /The Washington Post/ address the issue
of American illiteracy, and both Johnson and Strauss are certainly
qualified voices for the undertaking, but when we examine this
particular article, it's important we consider the context of the
/Answer Sheet/ newsletter and its intended audience. Though it's no
challenge to pitch the importance of reading and writing to parents and
professional educators, the most alarming and destructive issue at hand
is the educational disparity between /their adult peers/. “There's a
literacy problem in the capitol, but I'm not talking about young people
who can't read. Many adults --- perhaps even parents sitting next to you
at back to school night --- don't possess academic skills,” notes
Johnson with her very first paragraph. However, considering the nature
of parenthood, the audience primarily consuming these words are
undoubtedly preoccupied with /juvenile/ issues, specifically, and we can
assume their capacity to empathize with their fellow working adults who
could benefit from literacy education is actually /lessened/ from that
of childless readers of the same age as a result. “Despite the magnitude
of the adult literacy crisis, most of those needing to make up lost
ground are pushed toward traditional classroom settings---even though
many of these people can't possibly follow through because of cost or
work schedules or other obstacles,” she attests.

Perhaps more than any other American city, Detroit has been struggling
with a serious illiteracy problem. According to
[[https://www.wxyz.com/news/conquering-illiteracy-one-neighborhood-at-a-time-with-beyond-basics-program][a
profile of the Beyond Basics program]] (which was adapted from an
embedded video broadcast) on their local ABC affiliate's website,
forty-seven percent of adult Detroiters cannot read, but even companies
like General Motors --- who donated \$250,000 to the Beyond Basics
program earlier in mid-October --- are getting involved. The article
quotes Elijah Craft, a young man who was “reading at a first-grade level
as a senior at Detroit's Central High School.” “Craft would rare venture
from home for fear he would get lost because he could not read street
signs,” reports /WXYZ/ anchor
[[https://www.wxyz.com/about-us/staff/carolyn-clifford][Carolyn
Clifford]]. She frames the narrative around a reference to the 2009 film
/The Blind Side/ starring Sandra Bullock: “here, you might call this
story 'The Detroit Side.'” For local television news, this reference to
popular culture likely strengthened the story's power ensnare viewers'
emotional attention when it was aired, and even in this written
accompaniment, it proves an effective --- if a bit crude --- analogy.
The broadcast of Mr. Craft's interview also depicts his own deep
emotional investment in reading when he begins to shed tears, which is
not entirely communicated in the written article.

When the American news media discusses American illiteracy, it's almost
always in secondary or tertiary form: either by way of a short post for
a weekly education newsletter, an ultra-low-distribution niche editorial
column, or a personality profile of a local activist. Perhaps the
fundamental obstacle in the face of increasing the discourse surrounding
this issue is that its resolutions will require --- perhaps more than
any other social issue in this country --- advocacy by those who /can/
read on behalf of those who /cannot/ because of how sensitive and
isolated many of them feel. When voices of advocates like Lecester
Johnson /are/ uplifted by major organizations like /The Washington
Post/, the sociological weight of the illiteracy issue can be very
powerful. In quoting former United Nations chief Kofi Annan, she sums up
for its extensive audience what the facts should ultimately mean to
them: 32 million of Eric Black's so-called “illiterate people” in the
United States of America have been and continue to be deprived of their
“*/human right/*” to functional literacy.

If you've been keeping up with the web at all in the past two years,
you're no doubt at least somewhat familiar with the terms “Mastodon,”
“Diaspora,” or “federated social.” /Extratone/ readers may remember
[[http://www.extratone.com/tech/mastodon/][my interview with Eugen

its way around the front pages of the major technology and tech media
websites. Though the piece itself was designed and written quite
disastrously (genuinely sorry about that --- it was easy for me to get
carried away when I had no idea what I was carrying,) Eugen is a great

I signed up for [[http://mastodon.social][*mastodon.social*]] in the
February of last year, yet I suppose year sof o find myself going back
to Twitter looking for what I only get on Mastodon, these days: diverse,
sincere, talented, and extremely /curious/ users from all over the world
backed and deeply co-habitated with an inclusive developer culture
filled with smart problem solvers who just want to contribute something
grand. It's not exactly easy, yet instances and variations on the
ActivityHub project, itself have begun springing up at a pace I can't
keep up with. There's the open-source federated blogging CMS
[[https://github.com/Plume-org/Plume][Plume]], along with the gorgeous
and /very/ promising Instagram-esque [[http://pixelfed.org][PixelFed]].
Additionally, [[http://davidblue@diasp.org][Diaspora]] is gorgeous and
fully-functional now.

listen now, wrinkling husk of the wheat:

now or then, it did not matter, but forgone, it comes back around again.

come down out of there, now. tend to that mess before supper -- no
chance to get out of the house, again.

the disarray! standing, splayed - overgrown, lonely, half-awake.

blasted, or washing away. words aplenty, nothing to say.

When iPhone 4 handsets began shipping in the Summer of 2010, I'd been
carrying my first generation for three solid years -- since its now
history-stricken release, in fact -- and its age started to become a
problem. I'd drop it screen-down on a rock in the airport parking lot
just before going back to school for my Junior year, splitting a crack
in the screen that wouldn't quite kill it -- it was the demands of iOS 4
on its 412 MHz CPU and meager 128 MB of RAM that would ultimately cease
its usability.

The single 2 megapixel rear-facing camera would surprise one at times,
but was never lauded as anything but what it was -- a mobile phone-bound
sensor capturing very cellular-looking* images, but Steve Jobs wasn't
[[https://youtu.be/z__jxoczNWc?t=2m10s][three minutes in]] to his iPhone
4 presentation at the June 2010 Worldwide Developer's Conference before
he pronounced the design's closest possible “kin” to be “an old Leica
camera,” associating his device with photography in its first
impression. The equivalent of the first generation's rear-facing camera
could now be found facing /you/, and the fourth's primary sensor now
shot at 5 megapixels (2592 x 1936) with autofocus and 5x digital zoom,
setting a fundamental smartphone sensor configuration

that's still adhered to by the industry.

After unleashing Google Photos upon the ~15,000 images on my home
machine's hard drive last year, I have been constantly reminded of my
own photographic history -- for better or worse -- and regularly shown
five, six, seven-year old snaps in a manner that wouldn't have been
possible (or have made any sense) before. Recently, I was astounded to
find that I took many of the better shots with my iPhone 4, so I thought
I'd share a few from my high-school days in loving memory of my trusty
little rectangular companion.

On Win­dows XP bal­lot day, I spent /my/ beat­nik-ass time mar­veling at
the (seem­ing­ly) abrupt avail­abil­i­ty of some gen­uine­ly
inno­v­a­tive social apps on the Apple App Store for the first time
since iOS 7(?) Of course, I am aware that rea­son­able peo­ple would
regard a “sneak peek,” NDA-vio­lat­ing, per­fect­ly Adobe Pre­miered app
review to be pret­ty fuck­ing lame, and I won't dis­pute any
accu­sa­tions to the tune of “just an insane white guy with a Word­Press
site,” but I still believe it's impor­tant to talk about soft­ware
/espe­cial­ly/ because vir­tu­al­ly every­one uses it (as opposed to
qui­et­ing down just when these apps and the peo­ple who make them
attain the most advan­ta­geous pos­si­ble posi­tion to fuck the whole
world.)

That said, I'm going to keep this as brief and unre­vi­sion­ist as I
can: Tweetbot's
[[https://9to5mac.com/2018/10/18/tweetbot-true-dark-mode-gifs/][lat­est
iter­a­tion]] may actu­al­ly jus­ti­fy the
[[https://www.reddit.com/r/Tweetbot/][ded­i­cat­ed sub­red­dit]] I've
just dis­cov­ered! (Reddit's the last place any­one wants to talk about
apps, I guess.) I've com­plained at length about Twitter's
increas­ing­ly hos­tile (but
[[https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/25/17274828/twitter-earning-q1-2018-profit-user-growth][jus­ti­fied,

[[https://mashable.com/2009/05/02/twitter-iphone-apps/#S_O.z..2mqqJ][aston­ish­ing­ly

hon­est­ly grown sig­nif­i­cant­ly in accept­ing that the dynam­ic would
nev­er again see the pow­er of the world's most cash-stuffed com­pa­nies
deliv­ered into the sweaty hands of small, kooky one and two-man teams,
and it /nev­er/ would've occurred to me that Tweet­bot was still around
--- much less get­ting ready to update its trusty old app with a release
that would sud­den­ly make it clear­ly more sta­ble /and/
bet­ter-look­ing than its last com­peti­tor:
[[https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/twitter/id333903271?mt=8][the Native

[[https://www.searchenginejournal.com/twitter-redesigns-ios-app-for-one-handed-scrolling/276541/][sig­nif­i­cant
cos­met­ic surgery]], recent­ly. Name­ly, they moved the /one fuck­ing
but­ton/ that's giv­en the app a usabil­i­ty pre­mi­um over its mobile
web-based low-rent clone.

“The com­pose but­ton has been moved to the bot­tom right-hand cor­ner
and “floats” as users scroll down their time­line. That means the
but­ton is always avail­able to quick­ly send a tweet when the mood
strikes.”

Yeah okay, /Matt/.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE

In my Twit­ter glo­ry days --- that is, when I used to spend the
entire­ty of every one of my com­mu­ni­ty col­lege class­es Tweet­ing

on both mobile and desk­top that filled the eng­lish of the era's

Now, I have to stop myself from dig­ging too deep here and attempt­ing
some­thing absurd like /The His­to­ry of Twit­ter Clients/, but the
fuck­ing mate­r­i­al is there! I could spend an entire after­noon going
through YouTube search­es and gad­get blogs because it brings me back to
that time when I lived every day assum­ing these things were going to
con­tin­ue to aston­ish for my entire adult­hood. So many incred­i­ble
ideas! /How­ev­er,/ I'm going to save them for lat­er and focus on the
cream of the crop, so to speak: *Twit­terif­ic* and *Tweet­bot*, which
has been a long­time favorite of mine. As I said, it was in com­mu­ni­ty
col­lege that I first ponied up mon­ey for Tweet­bot 3 on my iPhone 4S
sim­ply because the hype over it among app and gad­get nerds was /so
bonkers/ that it man­aged to spill over into my life, despite the fact
that iOS7 and I were hav­ing seri­ous issues in our mar­riage.

[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE1YHcoPxMk]]

If you trust Mark Wat­son with your life as I do, you'd bet­ter believe
that Tweet­bot has been “[[https://youtu.be/DE1YHcoPxMk][a scream­er]]”
since its very begin­ning, when it pio­neered the /Pre­mi­um Poweruser/
seg­ment, for which a demo­graph­ic appar­ent­ly still exists. It was
/fast/, yet always notice­ably smoother than the native app, just as the
newest release is today. I must point out, though, that the blog­gers
and YouTu­bers who've insist­ed that Tweet­bot or Twit­ter­rif­ic or any
oth­er pre­mi­um app could replace the native Twit­ter app entire­ly on
iPhone even before they were stripped of a most live/push
func­tion­al­i­ty (which I'll come back around to in just a moment,) are
undoubt­ed­ly lying to them­selves --- as good as they got, they nev­er
over­took Twitter's own app in imme­di­a­cy terms, which is almost
inevitably going to present fun­da­men­tal deter­rence on the part of
the active Twit­ter user who intends to rid them­selves of the default
pedes­tri­an avenue of admin­is­tra­tion. Tweet­bot solved a lot of
things, it real­ly is /daft/ when it comes to noti­fi­ca­tions. It
wouldn't be the end of the world if they came a few hun­dred sec­onds
late --- it's that they're nev­er pre­dictably or con­sis­tent­ly so,
which sev­ers entire­ly the human per­cep­tion of engaged
/plugged-in-ness/, if you will. It's the same phe­nom­e­na Chuck
Kloster­man explores best in the con­text of DVRing live sports to watch
lat­er.

  the human attrac­tion to live­ness. We don't crave live sport­ing

  rep­re­sent those (increas­ing­ly rare) cir­cum­stances in which the

Tweet­bot is unques­tion­ably a more thor­ough envi­ron­ment in which to
explore Twit­ter than any oth­er third par­ty client, but it can't do
the live thing. (Please do com­plain to Twit­ter, Inc. about the API
sit­u­a­tion if you're so inclined, though.) All I'm try­ing to say is,
*there is no fuck­ing rea­son you'd delete the Twit­ter app* --- hide it
away in a fold­er and nev­er ever open it again if it dis­gusts you so,
but leave its noti­fi­ca­tions set­tings on so that it can keep itself
busy in there. Now /that/ is a smart work­flow! In fact, it was mine!
And it did work for such a long time that you'd prob­a­bly for­get about
the arrange­ment in no time were there not the occa­sion­al obvi­ous
dis­crep­an­cies between Tweetbot's Mention's tab and the native app's
instant noti­fi­ca­tions. There has nev­er been --- nor will there be, I
think --- a client for Twit­ter that can replace /some/ use of its own
prop­er­ties.

I think Tweet­bot 3 /made/ me into my own ridicu­lous equiv­a­lent of a
“poweruser.” Things are a lit­tle hazy now, but I know that I depart­ed
my main Twit­ter account just before the app's release, and I didn't
come back until 2015. I was going to school in the same old mall
build­ing that housed the tool store in which I was also work­ing in
full-time, which is sure­ly the only expla­na­tion for the
shame­less­ness I demon­strat­ed in bring­ing a wire­less Apple
Blue­tooth key­board to my class­es and plac­ing it behind the phone on
what­ev­er sur­face was in front of me so that I could lean for­ward and
type into iOS with my nose damned near touch­ing the screen. Strange­ly,
I was not able to ver­i­fy when Blue­tooth key­board sup­port was added
to iOS, but we're going to
[[https://www.reddit.com/r/iphone/comments/9y1bjd/when_was_support_for_bluetooth_keyboards/][con­clude
for the sake of con­ve­nience]] that it was first includ­ed in the
imme­di­ate pre­de­ces­sor to the iPhone 4S I was using then.

If you've made it this far, you've already seen the demos and skimmed
reviews at least. You should know by now whether or not Tweet­bot 5 is
worth it to you in pure­ly func­tion­al terms, but I think we should all
acknowl­edge that *this release of Tweet­bot is like­ly the last
com­pet­i­tive third-par­ty Twit­ter app for iOS*. The mess that is
Twit­ter, Inc. has
[[https://blog.twitter.com/official/en_us/topics/product/2018/investing-in-the-best-twitter-experience-for-you.html][made
clear this year]] that it intends to pri­or­i­tize its own clients over
main­tain­ing the APIs nec­es­sary for oth­ers to receive push
noti­fi­ca­tions. And when I say “its own,” I'm also refer­ring to our
dear­est [[https://youtu.be/EHDOQVAQzec][Tweet­Deck]], which they in
fact /absorbed/. From a busi­ness per­spec­tive, it makes sense: only
“six mil­lion App Store and Google Play users installed the top five
third-par­ty Twit­ter clients between Jan­u­ary 2014 and July 2018,”
[[https://techcrunch.com/2018/08/17/6-million-users-had-installed-third-party-twitter-clients/][accord­ing
to /TechCrunch/]]. I nev­er expect­ed to see Tweet­bot on the App Store
charts again, nor would I have con­sid­ered that
[[https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/echofon-for-twitter/id286756410?mt=8][Echophon]],
[[https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/tweetcaster-for-twitter/id420792544][Tweet­Cast­er]]
or
[[https://apps.apple.com/us/app/twitterrific-tweet-your-way/id580311103][Twit­ter­rif­ic]]
would have been left avail­able. They're on the App Store, at least, and
I can con­firm that they all tech­ni­cal­ly /still work/, but it's safe
to say they're show­ing their fuck­ing age. Tweet­bot and
Twit­ter­rif­ic, though, are not just satel­lite prod­ucts of the
plat­form --- they
/[[https://furbo.org/2011/03/11/twitterrific-firsts/][lit­er­al­ly built
it]]/. These two are the poles that have spent Twitter's life­time thus
far demon­strat­ing for the com­pa­ny and its user­base their own
respec­tive inter­pre­ta­tions of a mobile social appli­ca­tion. Today,
they are unit­ed --- along with
[[http://klinkerapps.com/talon-overview/][Talon]] and
[[https://www.tweetings.net/apps/][Tweet­ings]] --- in a
[[http://apps-of-a-feather.com/][plea for con­tin­ued access]] to the
plat­form they helped estab­lish on behalf of Twit­ter users and
devel­op­ers around the world.

Both Tweet­bot and Twit­ter­rif­ic are in their 5th ver­sions, and
nei­ther has actu­al­ly changed much since iOS 7. (Twit­ter­rif­ic
appears to still be in the same ver­sion num­ber.) Fac­ing the grow­ing
walls around the ser­vice, one strug­gles to imag­ine them sur­viv­ing
more than one or two iOS releas­es, but
[[https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/712292559058444288][I've been
wrong before]]. (In fact, I dis­cov­ered yes­ter­day that Look­book is
[[https://lookbook.nu/mom][still around some­how]].) By the time iOS 7
came around, the new native Twit­ter app still
[[https://www.cultofmac.com/246067/twitter-for-ios-7-released-with-new-design-icon-on-iphone-and-ipad/][looked
fuck­ing ter­ri­ble]]. When Tap­bots
[[https://mashable.com/2013/10/24/tweetbot-3-for-iphone-review/#SDbMxlCvFPqx][released
Tweet­bot 3]], every­thing about its visu­al expe­ri­ence was beyond
any­thing we'd seen on the iPhone before and its effec­tive­ness as a
Twit­ter tool was imme­di­ate­ly rec­og­niz­able in con­trast with even
Jack's brand-new app and mobile web expe­ri­ence. The ani­ma­tions were
taste­ful and smooth and the “pro user” label on Tapbot's demo­graph­ic
allowed them to ful­ly explore the func­tion­al­i­ty of iPhone's
ges­tures sep­a­rate any bond with the hypo­thet­i­cal­ly least-capa­ble
user.

This is a dynam­ic which I am appar­ent­ly unable to avoid across just
about all of my sub­jects --- includ­ing
[[http://extratone.com/freq][dig­i­tal media]] --- so you may take it as
gen­er­al­ly unrea­son­able or extreme, but I'm near­ly as tired of
being treat­ed as an idiot /user/ as I am an idiot /read­er/.
/Read­abil­i­ty/ is to /Usabil­i­ty/, etc. It's espe­cial­ly
aggra­vat­ing when I /could/ do so much more if devel­op­ers would just
assume I'm capa­ble of any knowl­edge acqui­si­tion or intel­lec­tu­al
growth what­so­ev­er. Except for a few left­over key­board short­cuts,
the native Twit­ter app's only func­tion are the most obvi­ous to engage
with, as per the high­est pos­si­ble stan­dards of use, which would make
per­fect sense if it was paired with com­pe­tent invest­ments in
/Acces­si­bil­i­ty/, but Twit­ter always appears to

to Mastodon's explic­it and vis­i­ble acknowl­edge­ment of
acces­si­bil­i­ty by way of just one young Ger­man man and a vol­un­teer
team, we cer­tain­ly know it's /not/ because it's an expen­sive one at
all. (The “if Mastodon can do it than Twit­ter can /def­i­nite­ly/
fuck­ing do it” argu­ment can be expand­ed almost with­out lim­it.)

I would like to com­mend myself now for mak­ing it this far with­out
men­tion­ing *Lists* --- a sub­ject which I've already
[[https://twitter.com/i/moments/996616971880882176][Tweet­ed]] and
[[http://www.extratone.com/tech/lists/][writ­ten]] about exten­sive­ly
--- but this time, I have the won­drous bless­ing of two pre­miere
mobile soft­ware com­pa­nies who rec­og­nized the poten­tial pow­er in
list func­tion­al­i­ty to dis­pel or avoid most of the inher­ent risks
assigned to the usage of a social net­work like Twit­ter and bet
heav­i­ly on it. Nei­ther can be uti­lized to the fullest with­out lists
and /wouldn't it be such a shame/ to not get your money's worth?
Tap­bots expand­ed their cura­tive abil­i­ty tremen­dous­ly by adding
cus­tomiz­able fil­ters to any time­line in Tweet­bot, allow­ing the
user to infi­nite­ly manip­u­late incom­ing posts with any
com­bi­na­tion of every vari­able sup­port­ed by the core Twit­ter code
itself. With­in a mat­ter of sec­onds, you could cre­ate a fil­ter that
will exclude all Tweets except for those from unver­i­fied accounts that
men­tion “blimps” and include a media attach­ment and apply this fil­ter
to any of the app's time­line views --- includ­ing Home, Men­tions,
Pro­file (your own Tweets,) your Favorites, and your Search­es ---
every­thing but your Direct Mes­sages can be sort­ed this way.

Tweet­Bot and I accom­plished a lot of sort­ing togeth­er, and it
wouldn't have occurred to me had it not crept to #1 Paid Social App
again a few weeks ago that per­haps
[[http://www.extratone.com/tech/lists/][my bias towards Twit­ter lists]]
could be entire­ly attrib­uted to my ear­ly use of Tweet­Bot and
Twit­ter­rif­ic, which allowed me to amass a
[[https://twitter.com/neoyokel/following][Fol­low­ing count]] of over
5000 with­out phys­i­cal­ly per­ish­ing or men­tal­ly dis­in­te­grat­ing
to the point of unde­ni­able insan­i­ty. How­ev­er, by the time
[[https://www.theverge.com/2015/10/1/9432291/tweetbot-4-ipad-iphone-available][Tweet­Bot
4 was released]] in 2015, it had long since swapped places with the
native app with­in my iPhone's home­screens and was only used when I
felt par­tic­u­lar­ly like Tweet­storm­ing from a sta­tion­ary
sit­u­a­tion. From my wire­less Apple Key­board, this meant Cmd (⌘)-N to
com­pose a Tweet and ⌘-Enter to send it.

Today ---
[[https://www.macstories.net/reviews/tweetbot-5-for-ios-brings-a-redesign-dedicated-giphy-support-and-a-new-dark-mode/][in
Tweet­bot 5]] --- this con­tin­ues to be a tried-and-true method of
Tweet­ing Tweets on Twit­ter, smooth­ly and effi­cient­ly, as always.
Return­ing to Ye Olde Alter­na­tive in 2018 yields both famil­iar /and/
new­ly-imple­ment­ed goods: ani­ma­tion and audio noti­fi­ca­tions are
car­ried over and/or updat­ed as need­ed to main­tain a flu­id and fresh
expe­ri­ence. The abil­i­ty to switch between its
intel­li­gent­ly-cho­sen col­or themes with a two-fin­gered ver­ti­cal
swipe, alone will be jus­ti­fi­ca­tion enough for many users like myself
to hand over anoth­er $4.99 to the Tap­bots devel­op­ers who've man­aged
against all odds to one-up Twitter's own mobile app devel­op­ment one
last time. Over any oth­er alter­na­tive app, Tweet­bot 5 retains the
robust qual­i­ties nec­es­sary to achieve #1 Paid Social App sta­tus on
the App Store despite its new API shack­les.

/I would argue that this is the best Honda's CR-V has ever or will ever
look, no thanks to [[http://www.extratone.com/words/inred/iphone4/][my
photographic decisions]]./

After 9 or so years and over 100,000 miles, /I/ have totaled my mother's
2010 Honda CR-V -- the car I drove cross-country for the first time at
significant distance (St. Louis to Washington, D.C. in essentially one
sitting,) and once complimented for being the best possible aesthetic
compromise of its near-universally and aggravatingly-compromised breed.
It was my her first 1st owner experience, which is frankly a bit of a
shame. If I'm completely honest, my late stepfather's decision to outfit
this utterly utilitarian vehicle with enough kit to break the $30,000
within a segment that has always clung to the 20s as one of its truly
communicable advantages feels less-than-ideal in retrospect, but what
can I say, really? It was not exactly a proud thing, but it /did/
transport a lot of young families and shelter us as we've navigated more
blizzard-like conditions than should be the norm for what is,
essentially, an expensive, extended Civic.

As per some particulars of my upbringing, I tend to get almost
alarmingly attached to vehicles, but it's hard to say I'm sad to see the
CR-V go from all but the most sentimental senses. Objectively, it's
simply not as high-value or as competent a vehicle as it and its
contemporaries are still made out to be by automotive media, pop
culture, or the presumptions in the average consumer's discourse. Though
it was never intended to be luxurious, the resulting automobile ended up
costing real luxury money.

** The Event
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: section0062.xhtml#the-event
   :END:

It's odd to have been driving so long without incident (pretty soon I'm
gonna be able to say “I've been driving for twenty years, bitch!) and
then suddenly find oneself at fault for the accident which claimed the
life of the single most sublime, defining object in his existence.
/This/ incident, though, was entirely the fault of the other driver. My
best friend and I were Northbound, crossing the intersection of Stadium
Boulevard and Rock Quarry Road at precisely the point where it becomes
College Avenue, where we were t-boned directly on the CR-V's driver's
side rear wheel by a mid-2000s Mazda 6 that decided to run the red
light. It's hard to guess the speed of impact, but the driver's side
side airbags deployed (as you'll see from the attached photograph,) and
the CR-V was spun nearly 270 degrees around the axis of the front
wheels. Neither of us nor the 6's driver was injured, but both of our
vehicles are surely totaled.

** Third-Generation CR-V Ownership in Retrospect
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: section0062.xhtml#third-generation-cr-v-ownership-in-retrospect
   :END:

Two or three years ago, I [[https://youtu.be/7ucf0Hp3eKk][recorded]]
some (not particularly conclusive or informative) thoughts with my
iPhone as I drove the old engorged Civic to the grocery store, when ends
abruptly after I said “I think one time I did try to go fast.” Like most
surviving crossover nameplates, though, the narrative began with a
genuinely good idea: Hondarize and modernize the Suzuki Sidekick
template on top of the Civic's platform and charge just a bit more for
it -- and like the rest, too, the concept has soured tremendously as
both crossovers and the compact sedans upon which they're based have
grown and fattened under their ever-increasing burden of safety and
convenience features. (I say “burden” and not “expectation,”
specifically because I know a grand total of zero informed people who
are at all thrilled about increasing gross weights across every industry
segment.)

This CR-V was my mother's first and only crossover following a three-car
line of one or two-owner-used, well-equipped V6 Accords in her garage --
the later two from the era when Honda's mid-sized sedan became a
surprisingly dynamic driving machine as advances in drivetrain
performance intercepted a point in the developmental timeline just
before gross weights spiked up toward their current safety and
electronic equipment-bloated figures. (In other words: in the sweet spot
when engines were growing more powerful but just before the Accord and
its peers got
[[http://www.speedmonkey.co.uk/2012/10/honda-from-trendsetters-to-just-another.html][/fucking
fat/]].) In 2010, the CR-V was /almost/ attractive looking as specced by
[[http://www.extratone.com/words/inred/crosscabriolet/][my stepfather]]:
the combination of the roof rack, bonnet bra, and EX-trim 5-spoke alloys
managed to resolve most of the discrepancies in the shapes I've seen
from other examples, but it also drove its price above the $30,000 mark.
To be fair to Honda, this decision could almost be considered a sortof
/breach of function/ considering the CR-V's original
ultra-mass-produced, utilitarian purpose.

*** Interior
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: section0062.xhtml#interior
    :END:

Neither the leather nor the nav/infotainment system has aged very well,
but it should be said that the latter is still 100% functional in 2018:
it interfaces well with my iPhone 8 Plus with only the occasional “this
device is not supported” hiccup (easily resolvable by simply re-booting
the connection, in my experience.) I'm not sure how astonished I should
be by the fact that the GPS still offers reliable routes 99% of the
time, albeit through a user interface design that seems to grow more and
more dated by the passing few seconds one may have to wait for it to
calculate. Accommodation remains about as uncomfortable as it was on day
1: thanks to its hard leather and the super-upright seating position
common to crossovers, I must continue to insist that operating this car
is a wholly unnatural experience, but its interior surfaces shall always
place well in a contest of /robustness/ and /longevity/, as they
certainly should.

*** Drivetrain
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: section0062.xhtml#drivetrain
    :END:

Perhaps the greatest letdown of this model year (2010) is its legacy
four-speed automatic transmission, and I assume the next year's
inclusion of a brand-new five-speed unit drastically improved its
driving experience. The specific regret one feels when such a
development arrives a year after buying any new car is one my stepfather
still didn't deserve, yet he was not spared. However, if /you/, the
reader, cannot be dissuaded from buying a CR-V of this generation for
whatever /goddamned/ reason, know that you must choose an example from
2011-onward if you want to retain your sanity. No, ye olde four-speed
wasn't quite as bad as the transmission that
[[https://youtu.be/zs9ScPleCTw][virtually ruined Dodge's new Dart]]
singlehandedly, but it certainly shows its age even for the most
inattentive or merciless driver. Without it, I would vouch for the 2.4L
four-cylinder's performance as adequate, but its contribution was and
forever shall be let down by the aging transmission's developing
Alzheimer's. Simply put: they are an unacceptably mismatched team.

Though I shall forever argue that part-time all-wheel-drive is almost
never actually justified in normal use -- and yet inadequate for any
“extreme” use, for that matter -- Honda's hydraulic “Super-Handling
All-Wheel-Drive” did indeed aid our CR-V's way in a handful of
circumstances throughout my mother's ownership, though neither of our
memories of these are robust enough to cite specifics. The single
no-bullshit /blizzard/ we experienced was the same type I managed to
navigate years later in a sub-compact Chevrolet to reach MagFest 2016,
if perhaps less intense. I would speculate that the system increases
mechanical drag -- and therefore fuel consumption -- to a degree that
couldn't possibly justify what little aid it has offered in /our/ use,
at least.

Back in 2016, /Pokémon Go/, overclocked Apple Watches, pissing
wearables, and What You See is What You Get blogging services all
claimed unprecedented casualties among consumers according to
/Futureland/'s iOS 10 episode, which we did our absolute best to
dramatize in order to survive what was expected to be the dullest event
on record. We'd only that day been first made aware of Boomerang photos
and the mysterious nature of “Live Blogging” as an occupation.
[[https://www.theverge.com/2016/12/20/14016568/apple-airpods-wireless-earpods-earbuds-review][AirPods
were introduced]] and subsequently shit on, and the
[[https://bilge.world/mono-audio-playback][comparatively archaic]] 3.5mm
analog audio jack was confidently parted with, finally. At least I got
over “forgetting” about Live Photos because it's rapidly becoming
difficult to keep stuff /on/ the phone now. /I/ am coming sincerely
close to believing none of this is real, anyway. Today, though, it's a
damned straight ballgame, isn't it? Months have passed since Apple
pushed out its major mobile OS release of the year to
[[https://www.theverge.com/2016/1/26/10835748/apple-devices-active-1-billion-iphone-ipad-ios][more
little rectangular computers]] than any one person could speedcount in a
lifetime and YouTube is already recommending me dozens of
[[https://youtu.be/CXKqCWWjxSM][videos about the next one]]. At this
point, you and I are already aware of the iOS development community, who
has already been using Internet Operating System 12 on their personal
devices for more than half a year by the time your irises are landing
here. Hopefully, all but two or three stranded, dying explorers in the
arctic have updated their iPhones and iPads by now, and why wouldn't
they?

Our expectations from this ritual are completely alien compared to those
we'd need to anticipate from the event 5 or 6 releases ago, when one's
phone had to be sent away (in a sense) to latch itself tight to the
stability of a desktop-class product in order to undergo a lengthy,
destined metamorphosis. Sometimes, backups via 30-pin to USB-2.0 cables
took hours, after which the custodian may or may not find their
companion's replication had completed successfully. If it had, one had
to be sure to close any applications apart from iTunes to provide a
working environment of utter silence -- restarting after finishing the
download was my own preferred method -- before entrusting the despicably
unreliable software to whittle away in a sometimes frantically
rebooting, feverish procedure with near life-threatening stigma: it
wasn't uncommon for an update to inexplicably fail, “bricking” the
subject iPhone and requiring that one take two whole steps in the wrong
direction and restore it from the entire backup they'd just created
(hopefully) in order to... make another, precisely-identical attempt,
for lack of variables or alternatives to the process. However, if the
user planned sufficiently and made a point to begin the whole charade
immediately upon arriving home for the evening, these potential
frustrations could be compensated for, and odds would favor counting on
their smartphone to emerge safe and sound from the procedure just before
bed, when even those holding the second-newest product in the lineage
would have just enough screen time to notice that text entry, web page
loading, and window management had noticeably slowed before sighing and
tossing their device toward the darkness.

These days, one would need to try very hard to be inconvenienced by iOS
updates. My iPhone 8 Plus is two or three times more powerful than my
laptop at the moment, and my new friends' WiFi connection is better than
what the State government uses internally, back home. I haven't needed
to physically back it up more than once or twice since I bought it ---
iCloud stores the lot for $4.99­ a month anyway. I blinked once watching
/Riki-Oh/ with high school friends some time ago and all of the sudden,
a 1.6GB download isn't really a big deal. Siddown and watch your
Instagram stories for twenty minutes, and /hey/! You're ready to update!
Somehow, I have abruptly found myself in a reality in which *I am the
obvious bottleneck* and my 100 words per minute on a smartphone
keyboard, even, is no longer fast enough: my fucking phone is now
*waiting on me* when it updates. The keyholder is the whole goddamned
holdup.

So, what possible purpose could there be in pounding out this “Review”
of a free software update that's in no way optional (waiting a month is
no longer a rational minimization of risk --- it's just dumb,) not any
more difficult to attain than the bills currently waiting in your
mailbox, nor allowed by the nature of mobile operating systems to
compete with any cross-platform alternatives? For myself, it's proved
[[http://bilge.world/ios-10-review-speed/][a gratifying tradition of
sorts]] and a good use of my apparently-abundant time if only for the
record's sake (hello, future web archivists, neohuman and otherwise!,)
but this release -- assuming I haven't overlooked something -- is the
most globe-shucking of all because of one single featureset: *Siri
Shortcuts*. However, the vast majority of the intra-Apple press'
coverage of this release has come across nearly as unconcerned with them
as I was originally. Take
[[https://www.macworld.co.uk/review/ios-apps/ios-12-3683670/][/Macworld/'s
iOS 12 Review]], for instance: it was the first result in my Google
search for “iOS 12 review,” yet Siri Shortcuts are only mentioned in the
bottom quarter of its first page. When I recorded the
“[[https://radiopublic.com/end-user-WdbezM/ep/s1!ba096][iOS 12 Review]]”
episode of my “[[https://anchor.fm/davidblue][podcast]],” I spoke as if
I was somehow the only person on the planet who comprehends the profound
implications of this software addition -- which was, of course, more of
[[https://techcrunch.com/2017/03/22/apple-has-acquired-workflow-a-powerful-automation-tool-for-ipad-and-iphone/][an
absorbent acquisition]] -- but I have since discovered one gem, at
least, which has continued the conversation in a most superb manner.
It's [[https://supercomputer.transistor.fm/about][a technology podcast
called /Supercomputer/]], and it's hosted by
[[https://twitter.com/AlexCox][Alex Cox]] and
[[https://twitter.com/AlexCox][Matthew Cassinelli]] -- the latter of
whom developed a significant amount of the iOS app
[[https://techcrunch.com/2015/05/16/workflow-hints-at-the-future-of-the-watch-as-a-computing-platform/][Workflow]]
(and wrote most or all of its documentation,
[[https://anchor.fm/davidblue][apparently]],) which Apple assimilated as
Siri Shortcuts. Both are extremely knowledgeable and competent
commentators on -- as far as I can hear, at least -- virtually *the
entire iOS *lifestyle**. (For those on the outside who've never stepped
in: laugh if you must, but yes it /is/ a lifestyle, still, and it's new
thought leader
[[https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/3/18124416/tim-cook-apple-infowars-white-supremacy-podcasts-platform-adl][isn't
exactly coming up short]] these days.) iOS is technically /software/,
yes, but it leaves an intractable itch for some greater, transcendent
term.

[[https://youtube.com/watch?v=pxtA9n2XwAM]]

In just forty minutes, without any prior knowledge about this feature, I
was able to create a Shortcut which sends any given handset's IP address
and precise GPS location (among other mundane metrics) in a text message
*to my phone number*. I could share this shortcut among my other
submissions to [[https://sharecuts.app/][Sharecuts]] or
[[https://shortcutsgallery.com/][ShortcutsGallery.com]], where any iOS
user could download and subsequently send this information back to /my/
phone. (Don't believe me?
[[https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/2873cc28684646e1904f0e80c21c8481][Have
a go at it yourself]] and I'll send back a screenshot if you'd like.) I
accomplished this without any particular skills or education in software
development or cybersecurity -- without any real /malice/, even -- I was
just playing around. As far as my recollection goes, Apple has /never/
included such a powerful, potentially-dangerous piece of software in a
standard software update before. It's both absolutely brilliant and
sortof a ripoff to be so entrusted for the first time. In many ways --
like my Disable Bluetooth & WiFi shortcut -- Siri Shortcuts represent an
awfully half-assed solution to some of the most basic, longtime
incongruencies within iOS. Sure, it's great that I can just make myself
a shortcut to completely disable my phone's WiFi and Bluetooth activity
with one press or Siri command (combining “type to Siri” with Siri
Shortcuts basically enables a form of Command Line functionality in
iOS,) but frankly, one should've expected the world's largest company to
/do it themselves/ in perhaps the second of third version of this
operating system instead of saying /okay, here are the tools -- you do
it!/ in its /twelfth/.

I've found it inevitable when speaking on iOS to avoid discussing the
/other/ literature available on the subject at any given time. The depth
to which technology media has assimilated the habits and mannerisms of a
single American company is absolutely mind-boggling, regardless of its
history, its market share, or even its recent trillion-dollar valuation.
Dozens of media companies --
/[[https://www.cultofmac.com/][CultofMac]]/,
/[[https://www.macrumors.com/][MacRumors]]/,
/[[https://www.macworld.com/][Macworld]]/, /[[https://9to5mac.com/][9to5
Mac]]/, [[https://appleinsider.com/][/AppleInsider/]],
/[[https://www.imore.com/][iMore]]/, and... more -- exist solely to
cover one single independent company: *Apple, Incorporated*. One wonders
how the sum total of the individuals involved with and these
organizations compares with the total number of employees working for
the company their careers are (for the moment, at least,) entirely
centered around. (Further interesting questions: are there any
comparable situations anywhere else in Western capitalism, and if not --
doesn't this sort of attention constitute /some kind/ of Monopoly, even
if it was not necessarily an anti-competitive one?) For “reasonable
people,” the image one conjures up of /The All-The-Time Apple Beat/ does
not lend to envy, but let's choose to limit ourselves to only the most
casual forms of speculation. I do not wish to mock them, for I, too
remember the sensation of The Apple Drug from an unfortunate time in my
childhood development when I was willing to wear a cheap sweatshirt
branded with a stupid Mac vs. Windows Users joke unironically to a real
live public Junior High school. There are few more embarrassing
admissions, except perhaps admitting that a part of me genuinely yearns
to return to this level of enthusiasm, as misplaced and cringey as it
was. It's the addiction to the mystic; it's aspirational in its
democratization. /Billionaires/ are running the same operating system
and much of the same software as I am every day -- even the most
followed person on any given platform is still accessing it through the
same interface I might be. These are incredible truths, but they also
reflect a dangerous lack of competition in a product category that has
become more essential to day-to-day human life than any other in just
three or four blinks of an eye.

[[https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/1068037512738811904]]

/Fuck David Blue/, though. Who are the /real/, /hard-hitting/ minds
who've kept this industry and this company in check? Well, it's funny
you should ask that, because the people's quirky /New York Times/ tech
critic of late -- the esteemed
[[https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/28/technology/how-to-survive-the-next-era-of-tech-slow-down-and-be-mindful.html][Farhad
Manjoo]] -- has just
[[https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/28/technology/how-to-survive-the-next-era-of-tech-slow-down-and-be-mindful.html][concluded
a five-year-long technology column]] with some essential (if perhaps a
bit unoriginal) advice: “*just slow down*.” If you're still following
along, you shall surely enjoy clicking some of his links, and I would
certainly encourage that you do until you're out of free articles, at
least. When Manjoo speaks, Apple listens: his January decree for Apple
to bend with the industry wind and build
“[[https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/17/technology/apple-addiction-iphone.html][a
Less Addictive iPhone]]” is convincingly prophetic considering *Screen
Time* -- probably the most mulled-over iOS 12 addition. As someone who
was diagnosed with Attention Deficit Disorder (however much or little
that may mean to you) just one or two years after I began using my/the
first iPhone, I've developed a history of what he might call /Addiction/
to iPhones in variable oscillation
[[https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/1042825995546320896][touching both
extremes]]. I carried my first-generation iPhone for almost 5 years --
as you can imagine, it was far from a 100%-functional device toward the
end of that bell curve. In contrast, I've also stood in line at dawn for
two iPhone launches, jailbroken, listened to podcasts /only/ about apps
(far before they were good,) and been compelled to chronicle and reflect
upon all of it for as long as I can remember.

There's no denying that the iPhone has had a profound effect on my life
mostly thanks to my own choices, which is why it's worth telling the
vast majority of you that features like Screen Time will never help you
achieve whatever vague conception of /reduced usage/ you may have. If
you haven't yet quantified the figures you'll find within it in mental
estimates, you aren't really concerned at all and if you /have/, Screen
Time will only confirm them. Using reminder notifications to optimize
your appflow makes no attempt at all to actually escape the mentality of
the behavior you seek to lessen from yourself. Another app is still
another app; a notification reminding you to stop using an app does
nothing but add still more stimuli. If you want to stop using the phone
so much, **stop* using the fucking phone*. If you are truly concerned
about how your handset companion has changed your life, turn it off for
a week/month/quarter -- however long you /possibly/ can. By that, I mean
no more or less than what you can manage without getting
fired/dumped/expelled/etc. If you have /truly/ reached this point,
anything less is probably worth it. There is simply no other way to get
a clear picture of how it's changed you.

Google, Facebook, and the rest of the industry are well aware of this,
but know they can't /actually/ advocate against the fundamental
mechanism that drives their businesses, so they express concern by doing
what they know: *building more software*. Apple is in a slightly
different situation: they still need you to buy their phones -- and even
to look at them -- but not past the point of hurting yourself
emotionally, mentally, or physically because those injuries tend to hurt
one /economically/. Screen Time's purpose is to keep us thriving and
buying, but the only effective solve for this can only be communicated
in garbage cinema language: *you must find it within yourself*. I am
/actually/ the worst person from which to model your life, except
perhaps for my iPhone use: unless there's little else worthy of my
attention, my phone is not out. Even if checking my
[[mailto:davidblue@gmail.com][emails]],
[[https://mastodon.social/@DavidBlue][Mastodon]],
[[https://twitter.com/neoyokel][Twitter]], etc. are my default tasks,
there are infinitely many besides that come first. Every once in a
while, it's okay to finish an important message while walking down the
street or waiting at a stoplight if things are urgent, but I can
guarantee you that my attention is better consolidated on traveling in
95% of cases -- moving with purpose and then focusing on my composition
/after/ I've arrived is almost always more efficient. I realize that I'm
cowboying it here and sound like your Dad, but I'm better with iOS than
he is, yet I've never publicly run into anything while looking down at
my smartphone in 10 years of hardcore use. *Find somebody who's company
makes you forget about all of this for hours at a time and treasure
them*. Also: *stop playing games on your phone*. /What the hell are you
doing/? Read a blog! Explore the wonders of the open web! Your peers,

exception is playing word/trivia games with your partner. That's very
cute and good for you.)

/I was elated to see that even Apple supports my

To get back to specifics, the *new Photos application* is now basically
what it should have been all along,

Touch has been virtually eclipsed]] for those strange bastards among you
who never liked it, and the release's most democratically-redeemable
feature is *optimization*, which even on my iPhone 8 Plus was blatantly
noticeable and very welcome. However, probably the best insight to come
out of my long, rambly /End User/ review was the revelation that
basically any other human activity is a better use of time than
[[https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/17/17862236/ios-12-review-download-features-update-speed-iphone-ipad-screen-time-notifications-siri][applauding

thoroughly tested and focusing instead on smoothing existing software.
In fact, I'd argue there is absolutely no reason for someone like me to
say anything even remotely positive about the world's wealthiest company
ever again, though that doesn't apply to /The Verge/ or Chaim
Gartenberg, who's review -- for the record -- was much more useful to
9999 times more people than anything I'll ever write. However, isn't it
sortof unreasonable to expect anything but /absolute perfection/ from
Apple at this trillion-dollar juncture? A handful of varying
interpretations of absolute perfection per product category, even.

picture, integrating wholly into the Apple environment has maintained
its relative rank above the alternatives to its specific minimal-esque
utilitarian /niceness/ which appeals so strongly to /those people/ among
both consumer and professional buyers. Readers from within this culture
recognized a short time ago that

across the board, though there's at least a moderate journey ahead
before it truly reaches this achievement for the median user. For
myself, iOS 12 improved the experience of using my 8 Plus and certainly
gave me something intriguing to play with in Siri Shortcuts. For the
rest of the world's billions of daily iOS users, I say /be as insatiable
as possible/ -- always expect more.

Thanks to
[[https://www.recode.net/2017/8/22/16184520/transcript-writer-chuck-klosterman-music-sports-recode-media][an
episode of Peter Kafka's]]
[[https://www.recode.net/2017/8/22/16184520/transcript-writer-chuck-klosterman-music-sports-recode-media][/Recode
Media/]], I've just now discovered that former /New York Times Magazine/
Ethicist, author of /Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs/, and longtime men's
interest media-affiliated sports and music columnist Chuck Klosterman
pronounces his surname /kloa-ster-men/ instead of /klaw-ster-men/ as /I/
have been, shamefully -- even within earshot of other human beings on a
handful of occasions. I am willing to submit myself for punishment for
these transgressions under the single condition that I be allowed to
call him /Cuck Klusterfuck/ the next time he ends a spoken sentence with
“or whatever” in an interview -- an unfortunate habit he's
[[https://youtu.be/NMzPX-MERbU][maintained for years]]. If my own byline
had any pedigree in the world of literary criticism, I would now collect
his penance simply by including those hateful, 90s stoner-kid buzzwords
in every quote, unedited, but it most certainly does not. I've searched
moderately hard for any reason to bother contributing any criticism of
books or their authors and returned with very little. I've read /The
Broom of the System/ and /White Girls/ this year, yes, but I'd have to
be a [[http://www.revelist.com/books/books-fuckboys-read/3289][Fuck
Boy]] to write anything about David Foster Wallace, and
[[https://www.interviewmagazine.com/culture/hilton-als-white-girls][Hilton
Als' elegant, genre-busting masterpiece]] is so far beyond both my
societal rights and perceptive capacity that I wouldn't dare utter a
single editorialized peep about it -- aside from a log line-length
recommendation -- even under immediate threat of certain death.

Given my recent [[https://www.instagram.com/p/BhArAZNF6W7/][voluntary
relocation to Portland, Oregon]] and the word-y pursuits on which I
choose to spend all of my money and energy, I should adore everything
about Chuck Klosterman and in turn he should be completely invisible
across the under-30 demographic, yet I've found a special originality in
his voice since first exploring it and I think it might be worth
requalification. A good friend of mine once dug his
[[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/04/books/review/Meehan-t.html][first
novel]]
[[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/04/books/review/Meehan-t.html][/Downtown
Owl/]] out of a bulk box of bargain books she'd bought as a preteen,
long ago and became an enthusiastic fan of his perspective and a harsh,
but fond critic of his persona. It was her copy of his second that I
read first:
[[https://www.npr.org/2011/10/04/141015210/visible-man-asks-what-if-no-one-were-watching][/The
Visible Man/]] -- ultimately a surprisingly-original take on the
/psychologist of a gifted outcast/ tale that classically exemplifies the
easy-to-digest yet thoughtfully-exploratory reputation of his craft.
Thanks to her library card, I was able to follow it up immediately with
Chuck's latest, most topical work -- an anthology of past essays written
for publications like /The Guardian/, /Grantland/, and /GQ/ entitled /X:
A Highly Specific, Defiantly Incomplete History of the Early 21st
Century/, which proved an impossibly entertaining, even more polished
execution of The Quaint Chuck's Explanations in non-fiction form,
beginning at onset with refreshing brevity in its
[[http://bit.ly/ckintro][introduction]].

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  I'm not fully accredited by either side of the professional equation
  (sportswriters think I'm too pretentious and music writers don't think
  I'm pretentious enough,) but I'm able to write about whatever I want,
  as long as it actually happened.
#+END_QUOTE

Using “pretentious” even when just vaguely and loosely expressing other
readers' thoughts about your work is the first of many miniscule
technical infractions against convention laid down in /X/'s arrangement
which proves to act toward the benefit of its experience. If you
substitute /car nerds/ for /sportswriters/, I'd personally identify with
this picoautobiography in a big way, but more importantly as a /reader/
I had never encountered anything written about sports which I would
describe as /pretentious/, per se, and that realization could very well
have birthed enough curiosity to land the sale, had I been skimming in a
bookshop, which I would've eventually been pleased with.

Now, during what we should hope to be the first dawn of a new microera
of sincerity, we must recognize how valuable it is for Klosterman as an
observer to be comfortably engaged with his subjects, emotionally, and
confident in the value of his commentary in middleage without the need
to insist upon his eccentricity, as so many cringey, culturally-daft
Dads do, these days. He uses keywords in his writing and spoken
publicity that /should/ dismiss him immediately as one of these -- a
nostalgic, out-of-time dork -- but are instead somehow magically
manipulated to /serve/ him in articulating reasonable, even
profoundly-innovative insight. As I have explored his bibliography and
his publicly-expressed thoughts, I have been caught up and hinged on a
single supposition: *Chuck Klosterman is the only white, 46-year-old
bearded Portland Dad you should be reading*. Do mind that I am in no way
exempt from this lens, but it's still my job to determine his viability
as an intellectual -- a “thought leader,” even -- for those of us who
were conceived around the same time he was wrapping up his collegiate
sentence at the University of North Dakota.

For a solid hunk of the American reading audience, a quick, elemental
vector of quality and mastery we look for in an essayist is the ability
to “transcend” their subject matter for even the most presumptuous and
conceited among us, usually to deliver a more abstract sentiment to
leave with. Here, Klosterman's significant career experience is
irrefutably evident -- in /X/, he achieves this transcendence
organically with a fluidity unlike anything I've read before. We can
already check a single box: convincing even a young professional
twenty-something to shell out for a physical hardback of contemporary
non-fiction requiring any sort of academic effort to consume is going to
be nigh-impossible, even though /X/ actually happens to be the
best-looking specimen of print product design I have ever handled across
cover, type, and layout. It's been difficult having to convince myself
to give this copy back.

In the interest of full disclosure, I must take special care to
emphasize just how highly I regard Peter Kafka as editor and interviewer
extraordinaire within the Media beat -- well-proven to be capable of
hitting consistently hard on both
[[https://www.recode.net/2017/8/10/16115548/patreon-jack-conte-fan-pledges-subscription-paywall-recode-media-peter-kafka-podcast][novel]]
and
[[https://www.recode.net/2018/2/1/16957324/wired-paywall-nick-thompson-magazine-advertising-subscription-peter-kafka-recode-media-podcast][old
guard]] industry personalities with refined,
[[https://www.recode.net/2018/5/22/17380908/youtube-music-launch-10-lyor-cohen-interview-peter-kafka-recode-media-kanye-west-childish-gambino][seemingly
unimpeachable]] stone-faced skepticism. However, this Chuck Klosterman
interview for /Recode Media/ is an uncharacteristically disarmed display
of serious admiration: he introduces /X/ with an outright confession:
“It's great. I bought it. I bought a signed copy,” which is an
unexpected oddity (though not an unwelcome one -- I'm glad Peter enjoys
his life.) Their conversation dips briefly in personal history (Chuck
and his wife moved to Portland from Brooklyn for its proximity to
family) before plopping down upon the substance of his clearly superb
and matter-of-fact interview technique. I'm not sure I've ever heard a
conversation between Kafka and any previous guests with whom he was
quite so obviously alike in general disposition.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  The only reason I'm able to ask you these questions is because I'm a
  reporter and I can ask you questions now that I probably wouldn't feel
  comfortable asking you if we were friends, so I'm not going to pretend
  that we are and I'm not going to create some fake thing where we're
  going to have a relationship beyond this conversation. I'm just going
  to ask you the things I want to know about and I hope that you respect
  the fact that I'm just being straight with you. I find that that works
  much better.
#+END_QUOTE

From the broadest possible pop cultural lens, Chuck's most spectacular
and widely-circulated work, demographically (I assume) is his
[[https://www.gq.com/story/taylor-swift-gq-cover-story][2015 interview
and cover story]] for /GQ/ with Taylor Swift -- then “the most popular
human alive.” Yes, it really /is/ worth dwelling on the image: */this
guy/*... this very Dorky Dad, just hanging out with the most
highly-demanded teen idol who's ever lived, sitting awkwardly next to
her in the backseat of her car as she maniacally panics to accept a call
from Justin Timberlake. When one Chucks such a distinguished contrast
upon such a high-profile contemporary medium, the weight of the
potential scrutiny becomes palpable, but Klosterman anticipates and
braces for this (very risky) business in the only manner he can:
acknowledging it over and over and /over/ again in the second paragraph
of his every interview appearance.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  It doesn't matter if it was complimentary or insulting necessarily. It
  would seem as though I wasn't taking her seriously as a musical
  artist, and the idea is that I do. That's why I'm writing about her is
  because I do think she's a meaningful, significant artist. It's not
  worth the risk of having the story then get shifted by other people
  who perhaps just perceive themselves as somebody who's a watchdog for
  certain signifiers or certain elements of the culture and that their
  job is to be on the watch for this. If your story then gets moved into
  that silo, that's all it's going to be remembered for... It's a
  touchier thing now. It's a more dangerous thing.
#+END_QUOTE

In the [[http://bit.ly/ckswiftpreface][print itself]], the cover story
is prefaced by a very short but uncomfortably-telling complaint about
changing expectations for culture writers. One might reasonably suggest
that Klosterman regards the practice of calling out or remarking on
“creepy misogyny” as “dumb” -- nothing but the byproduct of changing
“times.”

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  Something you may notice in the following 2015 feature on Taylor Swift
  is that I never describe what she looks like or how she was dressed,
  even though I almost always do that with any celebrity I cover... If I
  did, it would be reframed as creepy misogyny and proof that I didn't
  take the woman seriously as an artist. It would derail everything else
  about the story. It would *become* the story.
#+END_QUOTE

But... /is it/? Note how desperately close his language comes to the
/common white guy whining about feminism/ classification without
/actually/ fitting the bill. Right...? It /doesn't/? Surely, it must be
certified Awake through some combination of keywords or format I'm
unfamiliar with or unable to visually register because Klosterman's ass
would have long been grass, otherwise. These 224 words are /X/'s most
contentious, which you could call impressive, all things considered --
he appears to care enough about his public image to curate it somewhat
diligently. When a motherhood blogger published
[[https://atypicalson.com/2013/11/07/an-open-letter-to-chuck-klosterman-the-new-york-times-ethicist/][an
open letter]] in 2013 citing three very ableist uses of the R-word in
his work, it only took him two days to
[[https://www.huffingtonpost.com/kari-wagnerpeck/i-am-the-author-of-the-op_b_4319577.html][respond]]:
“I was wrong. You are right.”

More than any other writer of his demographic, *Chuck Klosterman has a
close, wary relationship with the everchanging contextual boundaries of
public expression*. He knows when to be transparent with his feelings on
progression, and he's careful to avoid what could be “problematic” for
the sake of functioning better as a writer (I assume.) For /Slate/'s /I
Have to Ask/ podcast, he managed to
[[https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2018/02/chuck-klosterman-on-how-the-approach-to-cultural-criticism-has-completely-flipped.html][speak
extensively]] about these mechanisms for nearly an hour without
bellowing anything definitively cringey.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  I can't say it's better or worse. It's just different, and because
  it's different, it makes me feel uncomfortable, but there's actually
  like an adversarial relationship with the history of anything, and
  that somehow that history is seen as oppressive. And you shouldn't
  even know about it. It's better to live in now.
#+END_QUOTE

A quick jaunt from pretty horrendous to almost-ideal, then. If we are to
place our faith in Chuck as our last bearded champion, we must hope that
last sentence is sincerely intended to be his lens to the changing
world. Granted -- even if it /is/ the truth -- it's not as if persistent
acknowledgement of one's position can miraculously wash away any
systematic patriarchal dynamics involved in authoring (or reading, for
that matter) a high-profile feature of a young woman on cover of a
magazine which explicitly seeks most to speak to
“[[http://www.condenast.com/brands/gq/][all sides of the male
equation]],” (are you /sure about/ /that/, Condé Nast?) especially
considering how unlikely it would've been for me to read anything about
Taylor Swift outside of this very white man's anthology. Fundamental
themes of power and control are threaded throughout both his fiction and
non-fiction, which is especially prevalent in the Macho Big Boy cultures
of the athletics and music industries. In profiling Taylor Swift -- the
undisputed apex of the latter in 2015 -- Klosterman provided a firsthand
account of the grueling maintenance of a public and private personality
under tremendous strain from said factors as they were magnified to the
max by the most extreme celebrity.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  Here we see Swift's circuitous dilemma: Any attempt to appear less
  calculating scans as even more calculated. Because Swift's
  professional career has unspooled with such precision, it's assumed
  that her social life is no less premeditated.
#+END_QUOTE

I'm right there with Chuck: I've even found a fundamental pillar in
Power and Control relationships supporting my own fiction experiments:
*how we attain them*, *how we lose them*, and *how best to make use of
them* -- all of which had apparently been quite problematic for Taylor
Swift for most of her adult life, though we wouldn't be allowed to
/really/ comprehend how deep her inner turmoil had drilled until it
overwhelmed even her expertly-designed self-control four years later,
[[https://youtu.be/3tmd-ClpJxA][boiling over entirely]] with such
unexpected violence that all of America's pseudorural
glam-pop-country-glossy-chode-hipsters let out a simultaneous,
dangerously-alarmed holler of /OH FOR PETE'S SAKE/ that was actually
heard and recorded from the overflying orbit of the International Space
Station.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  It's somehow different when the hub of the wheel is Swift. People get
  skeptical. Her famous friends are marginalized as acquisitions,
  selected to occupy specific roles, almost like members of the Justice
  League ('the ectomorph model,' 'the inventive indie artist,' 'the
  informed third-wave feminist,' etc.). Such perceptions perplex Swift,
  who is genuinely obsessed with these attachments.
#+END_QUOTE

No, it's not /only/ worthwhile as an exercise in superbly athletic
self-awareness -- the Taylor profile is profound. I'd recommend reading
and treasuring it with or without the rest of the anthology because
bizarre intersections like these are rare to come by from anybody else.
Short, sharp, and occasionally somewhat petty notions are what Chuck
Klosterman does best and most originally. Thanks to a digression of
Kafka's beginning with “you and I are about the same age...,” he arrives
(by way of REM, believe it or not) at a significant statement about
youth and identity.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  It seems strange to me to be into music for its coolness outside of
  high school. That seems like that's the only time when you're a young
  person and you're using art basically to create a personality because
  you don't have a real personality yet.
#+END_QUOTE

Klosterman is debatably exempt from the traditional academic abstract of
“objectivity” for the vast majority of his notable work because of its
stated primary subject: his “interior life.” Perhaps the success of his
voice could be at least partially attributed to his development of an
existential muscle -- a perspective unique enough to entertain, yet no
less recognizably Midwestern with which he's been able to reflect
particularly clearly on the profession in tandem with the experience
he's accumulated over the course of his career.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  You know, when you're young, you're a real emotional writer if you're
  a writer... If I was a young person now, I would be incredibly
  attracted to the idea that when you're 22 you can be a national
  writer, which was impossible when I was 22.
#+END_QUOTE

In a way, Klosterman does surmise that it /was/ indeed its objectivity
that media lost, and that writing is no longer a “one-way relationship,”
but a sort of ridiculous dance in which “many people feel the reason
they're consuming media is to respond to it... that it's not for the
content.” I would remind old Chuck that there are very few functioning
adults outside of academia or retirement in the United States who spend
much of their time reading anything solely for the sake of absorption,
and the disparity between those who were and weren't was exponentially
greater in the past. The story of American media is defined by its
cycles of waning and waxing democratization, but many of the more
traditional avenues in the business have bet on the “two-way
relationship” to keep them relevant.

My own favorite chapter of the collection is a
[[http://grantland.com/features/space-time-dvr-mechanics/][2500-word
personal essay]] constructed for /Grantland/ to answer a single
incongruity: “*Why is watching a prerecorded sporting event less
pleasurable than watching the same game live*?” Some form of this
question has at least mildly troubled every American since the 1960s,
including myself, and Klosterman manages to provide an entertaining and
concise analysis of this plight through his own wisdom. In its
[[http://bit.ly/ckdepressed][short preface]] in the volume -- which was
written “in 2008, in Europe, when [Chuck] was pretend depressed” is the
story of his encounter with a house-painting stranger, to whom he
explains the meter for success in his opinion-manufacturing profession,
as he sees it: “If a large number of strangers seem to think one of my
opinions is especially true or wildly wrong, there is somehow a
perception that I am succeeding at this vocation.”

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  Last weekend I was in a hashish bar in Amsterdam. It was post-dusk,
  pre-night. The music was terrible (fake reggae, late-period Eric
  Clapton, Sublime deep cuts.) I was sitting next to a British stranger
  with a shaved head and a speech impediment. Our conversation required
  subtitles, so I imagined them in my mind. He told me he had lost three
  family members within the past year: his mother, who was sixty-six;
  his uncle, who was fifty-six; and his sister, who was forty-six. He
  said he'd just turned thirty-six. He asked if I saw a pattern
  developing. “Yes,” I said. “But only numerically.” I asked what he did
  for a living. He said he was a housepainter. He asked me the same
  question about myself. “I manufacture opinions,” I said. “Really?” he
  asked. “How do you know if you're any good at that?” “By the number of
  people who agree or disagree,” I said in response. “If a large number
  of strangers seem to think one of my opinions is especially true or
  wildly wrong, there is somehow a perception that I am succeeding at
  this vocation.” “That's interesting,” said the bald British man who
  could barely speak. “I guess house painting is a totally different
  thing.”
#+END_QUOTE

Rarely are situations or discussions that begin with /back in my day/
actually constructive in any sense, but Chuck Klosterman appears to be
the exception. If you're willing to indulge him, you may find yourself
reassured. He now writes from a remote cabin (with WiFi,) was tortured
-- like all of us -- in sifting through and compiling his old work for
/X/, and finds its index to be his favorite part.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  Exploring the index from a book you created is like having someone
  split your head open with an axe so that you can peruse the contents
  of your brain.

He is

in a confident, fascinating technique of which any other music or

You'll notice that his entire answer to the live television debacle is
-- again -- entirely about control (or the lack thereof.) In fact, his
relationship with and desire for control also contributed to his choice
of profession.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  Part of the reason I became a writer is because it was this completely
  controlled reality where I could do this thing by myself where you'd
  go out and you'd do the interviews and stuff, but then you're back by
  yourself, transcribing and then writing. Then, when the story is done
  and you send it off, that's the end. Now that's the middle. Now it's
  like, when the story is published, it's the middle of the process very
  often because the consumer feels differently now.
#+END_QUOTE

While Klosterman's voice is pleasant to someone like me, neither it nor
himself necessarily belong to The People. In his
[[https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2017/05/x-chuck-klosterman.html][/X/
review for /Paste Magazine/]], B. David Zarley proclaims essays to be “a
love letter to a moment,” concluding that Chuck is “'effectively
narcissistic,' proving that culture essays can teach us something about
ourselves /and/ the people around us.”
[[https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/sportswriter-and-rock-n-roll-philosopher-treading-two-sides-of-opposite-worlds/2017/06/30/3aba0fb8-23a5-11e7-bb9d-8cd6118e1409_story.html][For
/The Washington Post/]], Justin Wm. Moyer notes “it's hard to think of
another writer who could make a 30-page, deeply reported essay about a
North Dakota junior-college basketball game interesting,” suggesting
that this new collection marks Klosterman's ascendance from *critic* to
*philosopher*. From what I've read to date, I would counter that he has
always fulfilled the term to the extent of its usefulness in the 21st
century and is even now beginning to redefine it. Last January, he
braved the “dystopic” Google Gates to
[[https://youtu.be/HhGA9e-OiFY][speak critically for a crowd of
Googlers]], describing them as “an umbrella over the entire culture,”
and urging caution and reflection in the coming future to keep them from
doing “something bad.” His engagement with them -- especially during
[[https://youtu.be/HhGA9e-OiFY?t=36m35s][the Q&A]] -- is a fascinating
insight into the Greater Google Mind, and I would encourage any invested
parties in Chuck Klosterman's role as a philosopher to watch the talk in
full. I was unfamiliar with “the boat-sails-wind analogy” before I read
[[https://www.theguardian.com/music/2010/apr/24/lcd-soundsystem-this-is-happening][James
Murphy's interview]] for LCD Soundsystem's “last album.”

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  Your life is a boat, the sails are your emotions, and drugs are the

#+END_QUOTE

*Control x Time = the Klosterman beat*. I suppose this must be what
other entertainment writers are referring to when they
[[http://www.dallasobserver.com/arts/pop-culture-critic-chuck-klosterman-talks-about-his-new-essay-collection-x-9559383][accuse
Chuck of nostalgia trafficking]], but I can't be so sure. Though I'd
like to think my own snout for the stuff is especially well-tuned, I am
undeniably from a different planet -- even auditorily. All but one or
two of the musicians interviewed throughout /X/ were entirely unknown to
me by name, which Klosterman's voice managed to make even more
compelling -- /not to mention/ the included stories of athletes and the
sports industry, which include stories of the human ego, paranoia, and
complex drama that always manage to transcend their setting when
articulated with such dexterity.

I've never before written a book review of any sort -- nor am I
defensibly qualified to compare culture writers -- but with good ole'
Chuck, I dove much further in order to tackle one very important
question: *should Klosterman be recommended reading for anyone under 30*
above or alongside bestsellers like George Saunders or groundbreaking
essayists of color like Hilton Als? In many a case, I must conclude by
saying, simply, that /something/ of value would be forgone if we shunned
Chuck, even if his insight is old news to all but the most rudimentary
yokels. I have little to offer women or people of color, but I'd bet /X/
would prove itself worth a library trip for any idiot white guys in
their lives who may be falling far behind. I don't know of any other
voices who are in a better position to introduce these issues, nor any
who are quite so practiced at handling them delicately. While Jenna
Wortham-level readers will gain little to nothing from this examination
or the ecology of its subject (and will likely find themselves pausing
momentarily for a deserved jest before moving on and returning to their
high-level plane of complex neoliberal commentary,) but most of their
less-aWoken fathers should find in Chuck a man they can truly trust, who
manages to consistently distill and articulate the need-to-knows of the
most complex pop culture and pop science conversations without using any
of the academic language found in most institutional discourse which
daddy finds too condescending and superfluous to bear. Those readers
who've absolutely fucking /despised/ my voice so far in this essay
should give Klosterman a go -- I take as much time as I can muster to
fiddle with and season the words in context like this work because *I
basically *enjoy* the bullshit*, yet I've found both /X/ and /But What
If We're Wrong?/ remarkably refreshing and impressive exercises.

  [These are] the cultural conditions in which I was raised under and

Reading Chuck Klosterman is going to be perturbing, but true sincerity
is almost always uncomfortable. Comprehensively, his nonfiction
represents perhaps the most important possible behavior to encourage
from both the critic and his readership because it incubates and exudes
*sincere curiosity* and a *genuine interest in learning to listen*. From
the perspective of quantified societal contribution, I'd argue that
Klosterman's craft is a significantly more honorable and worthwhile
pursuit than greater academic literature in its unique and entertaining
treatment of subjects the establishment tends to pulverize into minutia.
Unless he's broke and/or bookish, buy /X/ as a gift for your Dad and at
least give it a try when he's done. If nothing else, /at least/ *read
the Taylor Swift interview*, okay? If he doesn't enjoy the book, I'm
always available if one or both of you need to blow off some steam:
*give me a call at (573) 823-4380*. (/Normal text messaging / talktime

Assuming Jesus Christ is in your thoughts this evening before yet
another anniversary of his birth, I am infinitely astonished by the
truth in what I'm about to suppose with you. If the Son of God was
living today, most of us have agreed for a long time now that he'd use
marijuana recreationally -- big fuckin whoop. I think it's far more
interesting and appropriate (we all know his birthday was
[[https://www.thisamericanlife.org/47/christmas-and-commerce][wholly
reconfigured into a consumerist holiday]] long ago) to speculate on how
he'd behave after finding himself inadvertently in the market for a new
laptop within the ~$1000 range (following a /stubbed toe whilst walking
on water/ incident, perhaps.) Surely, it would not be entirely holy for
him to opt in to the Foxconn-complicit world of Apple, Incorporated, nor
the
[[https://bilge.world/google-soul-ledger-dont-be-evil][openly-blasphemous]]
one created and exuberantly grown by Google LLC, and I'm afraid he'd be
too much of an /End User/ idiot to integrate any of the sparse
Linux-dedicated hardware available. In May of 2017, however, Billy
Gates' old Microsoft finally released
“[[https://www.theverge.com/2017/5/5/15557738/vergecast-podcast-255-microsoft-surface-laptop-samsung-dex-i-clicked-the-doc][the
laptop we've always wanted them to make]],” but could its recent update
be truly worthy of our Lourde and Saviour? Or your newly-enrolled
offspring? Should you sprint downstairs and swap out the new MacBook Air
you just bought?

From an entirely valid perspective, an observer might declare my last
two months of 2018 to be an outright shameful period defined by
hypocrisy and traitorous betrayals. After finally taking the time to
explore the full narrative surrounding Linux and the bloody tale of
Microsoft's cruel genocidal destruction of countless creative software
projects throughout computing's adolescence (see:
“[[https://youtu.be/TVHcdgrqbHE?t=425][Embrace, Extend, Extinguish]],”)
I eventually declared myself “100% Open Source” and began outlining an
essay designed primarily to express that /Linux is finally ready to be
the operating system of the people/ without succumbing immediately to
the brand of cybercrackpot illegitimacy associated with the L-word in
the minds of the general public so readily thanks to decades of
misinformed, condescending neckbeards. Such a feat would require entire
new planes of cultural awareness and dialectal delicacy, yet certainly
result in zero personal reward from even the best possible outcome, yet
I proceeded to ponder the subject very deliberately all the way through
October because I genuinely believed in a new democratized future of
computing. 2018 had been my Grand Awakening to the idyllic possibilities
of Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) across the whole applied
spectrum from office suites to [[http://bilge.world/federated/][social
networks]], yet -- as two thousand eighteen comes to an end -- I've
managed to find myself among the most
[[https://youtu.be/O0RSeFcv3Qs][jaded, soul-sapped]] tech community I
have yet encountered: *Microsoft Administrators*.

Complimenting this Linux-laden culture in which I was not so long ago
deeply embedded was a confused and frustrated outlook regarding what I
felt were excessive and completely idiotic sacrifices across the
industry's hardware design to the greedy, gluttonous god of Lightness.
It seemed only reasonable to Myself As Consumer that the entire buying
public should exclusively seek designs prioritizing greatest possible
performance and battery life, even from portable computers and
smartphones, so I assumed my perspective on this updated iteration of
Microsoft's most laptopy Surface laptop -- which exists in large part to
[[https://www.pcmag.com/news/364728/spec-down-apple-macbook-air-vs-microsoft-surface-laptop-2][compete
directly with]] Apple's beloved (and just-updated) MacBook Air --
wouldn't be at all useful. However, a few weeks ago, my employer
prompted me with a sweet sweet ultimatum: /for the sake of a tax break,
I want to spend ~$1000 on a laptop for you as soon as possible/. Yes, I
know I should consider myself a very fortunate man -- this
[[https://bilge.world/hp-spectre-x360-review][wasn't even the first
time]] I'd been surprised with the “hey, I want to buy you a laptop but
it has to be today” experience, and may even be considered a sort of
sequel to my /Tales of Whirlwind Manic Consumerism/, but it's ultimately
one of the most idiotic strategies to achieve a major purchase decision
and completely inadvisable for anyone on a budget. Still I was indeed
thankful to be put in a nearly-identical situation of Consumer
Electronic haste, and have come to be especially appreciative of the
specific time I was approached as such: just one week after
[[https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/16/17979516/microsoft-surface-laptop-2-review-specs-price-features-windows-10][Microsoft
launched the Surface Laptop 2]].

Considering the vast majority of its users are
[[https://theoutline.com/post/2923/the-popularity-of-microsoft-surface-is-the-least-realistic-thing-on-television][trapped
inside my television]], there's no harm in covering the Surface brand
with our virtual palm for a moment. If you'll indulge me so, you'll
notice that Microsoft has actually delivered unto us *The Laptop II* --
as in, the sequel... the /successor/ to /every other laptop computer/
yet conceived... but does this one machine truly represent the second
coming of the /Notebook Christ/? Naturally, it would be a bit zealous to
stand behind this extreme statement with 100% sincerity, but there truly
/are/ certain elements of this Personal Computing product's execution
which do indeed will its user to expect and/or desire from others in
coming years. As I've stated before, I also simply cannot help but be
jazzed by such bravado from the mouths of even a company with as crooked
and hateful history as Microsoft's. (Note: no other technology company
has actually achieved what Microsoft historically has in this regard,
and hopefully none ever will again.)

I must be honest: it hasn't yet been two months and I've already scuffed
and perhaps even /stained/ the beautiful maroon alcantara surrounding my
machine's touchable body, but it's occurred to me that I might draw upon
the vast library of [[https://youtu.be/PM-FbFIBoCs][automotive interior
tutorials]] available on YouTube -- and even purchase some of the
alcantara care-specific products they recommend -- in order to /really/
maintain the exterior of the Laptop II. After all,
[[https://www.popularmechanics.com/cars/a9653/what-is-alcantara/][alcantara
was undeniably car culture's material first]]. I should also confess
that objectively, the Surface Laptop II is the best-suited computer for
/my personal uses/ that I've ever owned /or/ used for any length of
time. Subjectively, I don't think all of the hardware design touches
that make it so -- like its keyboard layout, divine 3:2 aspect ratio,
and particular I/O complement -- have yet had the chance to seduce my
emotional brain into truly /loving/ it as much as I certainly should by
any reasonable measure. For my own sake, I hope I'm able to fall in
child-like infatuation with its magic, but in the interim, I believe the
coldness of my heart should hopefully preserve any useful commentary I
might have to add. Though this is undoubtedly the most timely review of
a hardware product I've ever published, I'd still ask that you indulge
my perspective suggesting the importance of considering it part of a
/package/ with its operating system, considering that the whole of tech
media would've unanimously declared it the year's
“[[https://mashable.com/review/microsoft-surface-laptop-2/][best
laptop]]” were Apple's aging, but still widely-adored MacOS absent from
the frame.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  I've tested a bunch of laptops this year, running the spectrum of
  2-in-1s, Chromebooks, MacBooks, gaming laptops, etc. Everyone's needs
  are going to be different, which is why there's no such thing as a
  one-size-fits-all for laptops. But enthusiasts' laptops aside, I
  strongly feel the Surface Laptop 2 is the best laptop of the year. And
  by that I mean the best laptop for most folks' needs.
#+END_QUOTE

With as much humility as possible, I must add that I myself am
/anything/ but “most folks,” yet my experience so far with the product
has been one of astonishing compatibility and battery life. Using
recommended power settings, the Surface Laptop 2 endured
[[https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/1080514545062477825][*four hours
and twenty-two minutes*]] of a workload it wasn't particularly designed
for including heavy web browsing, image manipulation, brief audio/video
capture with OBS, and moderate subsequent editing in Audacity and
OpenShot. Dan Seifert -- Vox Media's
“[[https://www.recode.net/2017/5/12/15628228/microsoft-surface-laptop-apple-macbook-air-windows-10s-dan-seifert-recode-podcast][only
Windows user]]” -- reported “about seven hours” of Microsoft's claimed
14.5, but frankly, I don't know what any of y'all are doin -- I'm just
thankful this machine is a better marathoner than any other I can recall
owning. While we're on the subject, I consider Microsoft's inclusion of
a magnetically-attached power cable and unassuming auxiliary USB
charging port on the attached power supply to be personal godsends --
further evidence, even, that the Surface Laptop 2 was /actually designed
to be nice to use/. For the sake of those readers *actually in the
market for a new laptop* who've somehow found themselves here, though,
Raymond Wong's review for /Mashable/ is the most thorough offering
you'll find -- it's quoted front and center on
[[https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/surface-laptop-2/8XQJKK3DD91B][Microsoft's
web page for the Laptop II]], even -- but it's important to mention that
his critical comparative perspective predates the late launch of its
ultimate competitor,
[[https://mashable.com/review/apple-macbook-air/][the new MacBook Air]].
Rather pitifully, however, his colleague's “good, but not great”
resolution suggests that Apple failed to challenge Microsoft's
relatively moderate update enough to warrant any revision, and that
/Mashable/ as a publication stands by my new laptop's /Best of the Year/
title, for whatever it may or may not be worth to you.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  If the new
  [[https://zdcs.link/zjWl1?pageview=06Fe2GZo26XvMYZgLndTadT][MacBook
  Air]] came in at the same price as the old one, it would be a steal.
  Sure, you pay for the privilege of being able to use macOS on the
  Apple ecosystem. But in years past that also meant access to
  cutting-edge features and design. As pretty as the MacBook Air is,
  there's nothing that innovative about it. In today's Apple, it seems,
  privilege amounts to just staying current.
#+END_QUOTE

You won't find many others who regularly invest editorial merit in
publishing 2500+ word laptop reviews anymore, which I'd concede is
plenty reasonable in the Surface Laptop's case, at least. Perhaps your
first point of comparative entry should be
[[https://www.recode.net/2017/5/12/15628228/microsoft-surface-laptop-apple-macbook-air-windows-10s-dan-seifert-recode-podcast][a
barely-dated conversation]] between Kara Swisher, Lauren Goode, and Dan
Seifert on /Too Embarrassed to Ask/ regarding the original's odds of
truly competing in the “premium laptop” segment (if you'd prefer to hear
from those who struggle to take it seriously, that is.) Assuming
[[https://www.zdnet.com/article/what-oems-desperately-need-to-learn-from-microsofts-surface/][the
original product direction of the Surface line]] still stands, Microsoft
doesn't actually intend to sell at high volume, especially when it comes
to this runt of the marque, which does not hesitate to omit itself from
the popular discourse of the moment surrounding tablets as the future of
all computing to which all of its siblings have
[[https://www.theverge.com/2014/5/23/5743416/microsoft-surface-pro-3-review][contributed
so much]]. Though I shall always remember my dearest Libel (the special
edition Spectre x360 with which I built most of /Extratone/) with great
respect and deep fondness -- I think it's even worth mounting on some
sort of plinth -- the significantly-cheaper Laptop II has already
demonstrated true value in its “premium” segment bragging rights with
/far/ superior materials and build quality. If you're looking for the
prettiest possible slice of magnesium lightness but aren't the sort to
have followed the story of Microsoft's first venture into personal
computer production since it began in the last year of the Mayan
calendar, it's worth your while to read
[[https://www.theverge.com/2012/6/19/3097726/surface-microsoft-next-chapter/in/2859835][Joshua
Topolsky's projections of the project's impact on the popular narrative
surrounding Microsoft]] from history's freshest possible perspective:
the eve of the first Surface tablet's launch.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  The entire tablet was designed in-house by Microsoft's teams, and if
  you believe what was said in the presentation yesterday, design and
  functionality in hardware has suddenly become a big deal in Redmond.
  That's a big shift, and it's an important one. The announcement of the
  Surface shows that Microsoft is ready to make a break with its history
  --- a history of hardware partnerships which relied on companies like
  Dell, HP, or Acer to actually bring its products to market. That may
  burn partners in the short term, but it could also give Microsoft
  something it desperately needs: a clear story.
#+END_QUOTE

A pungent stigma festered from Microsoft's history of inadequate and
inelegant public relations (especially compared to its greatest longtime
rival) has remained in relentlessly obvious orbit around every
“significant” Windows and Office update for so long that its status quo
has grown into a truly inhibitive force for /all/ parties involved.
Topolsky is unquestionably a compromising favorite of mine, but it's
hard not to decry then-CEO Steve Ballmer's failure to comprehend Josh's
day-after insight in the /whole three months/ that passed before
[[http://old.seattletimes.com/html/businesstechnology/2019168601_microsoftballmer16.html][his
Seattle Times interview in September, 2012]]. Ultimately, The Big M is
either *incapable* of understanding any alternative utopic Visions of
Computing to its own, or simply *overwrought* with the same
counteraspirational carelessness its culture has always depended upon.
In analytical terms regarding Ballmer's utilization of the forum's
opportunity to finally /tell the fucking story/, at least, the timidity
of a term like “pre-eminent software” as a viably bright new beacon in
contrast with “/people/ would say we were a software company” (emphasis
mine) -- as if Steve-O himself doesn't even have the power to publicly
/describe his company's function/ as its #1 man -- combined at the apex
of what was almost impressively-negligent behavior.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  I think when you look forward, our core capability will be software,
  (but) you'll probably think of us more as a devices-and-services
  company. Which is a little different. Software powers devices and
  software powers these cloud services, but it's a different form of
  delivery...
#+END_QUOTE

Don't make the same mistake I did and wear yourself out trying to
extract the meaning from these three sentences -- there's none to be
found. Ultimately, whatever opportunity the Surface project could have
provided for Microsoft's identity has been vastly overshadowed by its
success as last resort supercatalyst to restore /any/ sense of dignity
and pride within the hardware companies who produce the vehicles. In
Fall 2017, /The Register/
[[https://www.theregister.co.uk/2017/10/04/surface/][quoted industry
gossip]] regarding the company's new CEO Satya Nadella and his intent to
“exit the product line” because “overall they are not making money [and]
it doesn't make sense for them to be in this business,” but newcomers to
this conversation should know that no subsequent reporting has
corroborated anything but a
[[https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/5/18125306/microsoft-fluent-design-windows-office-surface-future][sustaining
future of the line]], though the measurable rate of innovation in
Microsoft's products continues to leave much to be desired. Now that
you've heard from the experts, though, allow me to expand our lens a bit
and examine what the Surface Laptop 2's existence suggests as per /The
Present & Future of Computing/.

In case I've yet to mention it, all of my tech writing is in substantial
debt to my much-older and child-oriented siblings for providing 8 nieces
and nephews over the course of 11 years -- if not for any reason but the
perspective offered by the slightest observation of their day-to-day
lives. In this profoundly bizarre and historic technological sprint our
species is experiencing, the differences in their respective
relationships with consumer tech as they've grown up are
fascinatingly... disturbingly significant. My eldest niece Abby was born
four years after myself in 1998, and her younger sister Amber just quite
three years later in 2001. All three of us are Aquarians who went to the
same public schools (aside from 2 exceptions on my part,) and the two
sisters have been close, significant influences on each other all their
lives, yet the way Abby and I use and think about computers differs
significantly from Amber's. Our first real PCs introduced an important
social and intellectual vehicle to our pre-teen lives, and both of us
still “live on” our machines as young adults. For us and many others
from this short-lived microgeneration of ours, budget laptops like the
Dell Inspirion 2200 (which served as the first “real computer” for both
of us) introduced the internet and Being Online as a State of Being with
AIM groups, MySpace, and Yahoo! chain mails before smartphones and
tablets were capable of doing so.

Amber prefers to use her iPhone for most everything and regards her
computer as a tool for work -- it's booted up and down exclusively for
that purpose, which is significantly healthier than the habit Abby,
myself, and many of my Online friends developed: we left our computers
running and Logged On all the time because we were otherwise
unreachable. We learned from origin to depend on them for 100% of our
computing tasks -- from streaming Pandora to playing Flash games within
six billion open browser tabs -- which likely explains both our ADD and
its resulting influence on the ease with which our personal computers
can distract us. As a Journalism student and professional photographer,
Abby uses the new 15-inch MacBook Pro, and [Insane Blogger] David Blue
has spent years looking for an alternative, becoming
[[http://bilge.world/ios-10-review-speed/][the first and only iPhone
user to make extensive use of its Bluetooth keyboard support]] in the
process, but both of us are entirely uninterested in the rest of the
industry's insistence on
[[https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/2/17515896/dell-xps-2-in-1-convertible-laptop-review][convertibles]],
[[https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/16/17979504/microsoft-surface-pro-6-review-tablet-features-price-windows-10-matte-black][removable

[[https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/5/18062612/apple-ipad-pro-review-2018-screen-usb-c-pencil-price-features][‘professional'
tablets]]. I wish the Linux community was finally ready to drop the
elitist pretenses plaguing its nerdy history; I wish I could finally
tell someone like Abby that a machine like the
[[https://www.pcworld.com/article/3198671/linux/the-system76-galago-pro-is-a-fierce-featherweight-competitor.html][System76
Galago Pro]] could slot itself into her workflow without losing her time
or compatibility -- that the reputation surrounding Linux People had
finally lost most of its validity and her desire to learn more about
computing as a young woman and Power User would be met with respectful
and worthwhile conversation from their end. Unfortunately, I've still
found some of the Old Guard to be elitist, socially behind, and
juvenilely possessive, as if computing was still the niche interest from
their 1980s and 90s childhoods. Though this conversation certainly
warrants its own essay in the future, I'll just express now that it's a
real shame some folks don't realize the entire point of making great
things is ultimately to *give them to the world*.

The opportunity I've had in the past year to finally get my Linux distro
frenzy over with and out of my system managed to both radicalize and
democratize my understanding of MacOS, Windows, and Linux as they are in
the present. While I had nothing better to do, fiddling with Ubuntu
Studio and Linux Mint to the extent I did throughout Spring and Summer
led me to further appreciate
[[https://mastodon.social/@DavidBlue/101073796864823479][the value of
keyboard shortcuts]], gave me
[[https://mastodon.social/@DavidBlue/100917824456128537][my first real
proficiency with a command line]], helped
[[https://anchor.fm/davidblue/episodes/Revelations-of-Network-Withdrawals-e2d7aq/a-a235vs3][globalize
my comprehension of my own technological privilege]], reacquainted me in
a huge way with both
[[https://www.reddit.com/r/vintagecomputing/comments/9hpqov/lotussmartsuite_and_the_year_2000/][the
true history of software]] and my own personal past as
[[https://mastodon.social/@DavidBlue/100771954295147256][an experimental
test tube baby of Microsoft's]], and helped to answer a lot of questions
I'd worried over for years about why software seemed like it simply
/couldn't improve/ anymore. While it's true that important open source
projects like
[[https://www.forbes.com/sites/jasonevangelho/2018/09/10/elementary-os-first-impressions-a-great-linux-doorway-for-macos-users/#231f4faa4289][ElementaryOS]]
continue to sprout from the Linus Extended Universe and the
[[http://bit.ly/dbmastodon][growing Open Source community on Mastodon]]
is filled with brilliant, helpful, unpretentious, and remarkably curious
enthusiasts (probably because many of those I've interacted with so far
are non-cis and/or non-white,) little ole me was able to stumble upon
some totally unnecessary and excruciatingly ignorant sociopolitical
commentary by way of the white, middle-age host and his
undoubtedly-white and staunchly libertarian caller on a live broadcast
of the /Ask Noah Show/. (It's not as if I haven't said ignorant and very
ugly things too, but I wasn't a forty-something /father/ on a
semi-professional talk show representing an entire community.)

Essentially, I was quite frustrated and disappointed to find that *Linux
is still let down most by its own community*, but the operating system
itself is still /much/ further along on its way to becoming a real
alternative for the average user than mainstream tech journalism would
have you believe. However, in my case, finally taking the time to
/really/ learn about Open Source computing /also/ helped me understand
(surprisingly) why Apple and its environment continue to be the best and
most popular choice for professional applications. Linux Mint gave me
tremendous power in enabling me to alter, specify, and redesign the most
minute details of its interface, but I couldn't have foreseen how
all-consuming such power would be for someone like myself. In
retrospect, I've realized that I ended up spending more time perfecting
my custom LibreOffice Writer shortcuts than I did /actually writing/ --
I somehow found myself in a mind state which justified unironically
creating /a shortcut for the Shortcuts menu/. Though I swore I'd never
succumb to the bewildering hobby of collecting and exploring different
Linux Distributions, it took no time at all for me to fill a folder with
disc images of the installers for almost a dozen different
interpretations of the operating system after I'd made the simple
concession to myself that /I'll just try Ubuntu, that's all/. The most
profound realization from all this (arguably otherwise wasted) time:
*for a user like me, a walled garden is actually the best place to be
productive* because /apparently/, I don't have the self-control to keep
myself from /running away/ and/or fixating on completely unproductive
tasks without its boundaries. I think this phenomenon is perhaps the
worst culprit in the persistence of the aforementioned divide between
“computer people” and everyone else who simply /uses/ computers, as I'm
sure any one of the latter could tell you after all of five minutes with
a Linus type.

The most comprehensive and somewhat-urgent revision to illustrate the
significance of this contrast from my perspective regards the
exceptional iOS/MacOS markdown-based notetaking app Bear. Frankly, my
own
“[[https://bilge.world/evernote-dropbox-paper-word-processing-history][Word
Processing Methodology]]” essay from June has already become
problematically out of date (and therefore embarrassing) in terms of my
own knowledge of the segment and its history. Though I promised the
conversation was “done,” I've continued to explore further into word
processing's history as well as its current state. “I had a go at Bear's
free iOS experience and saw little functional difference from DayOne,”
the old, negligent, cursory David Blue noted, but if I'd simply been
willing to cough up a bit more time and just $1.49 a month for
[[https://bear.app/#pricing][Bear Pro]], I'd have spared myself such
shame and realized that the hype around this app really is 100%
justified. *Bear is the most beautiful iOS app I've ever seen*, but I'm
now also fully qualified to declare it the most effective execution of
“distraction-free” writing software to come along in the past 25 years.
Developer Shiny Frog's secret is their perfect balance between
capability and simplicity. It turns out,
[[https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/2/14785264/evernote-replacement-bear-app][Daily
Content Lord Casey Newton's word on this matter]] /really was/ worth
more than mine, not to mention more succinct: “Bear may look simple, but
there's power underneath the surface.”

Those longtime Linux and Windows diehards who've tolerated me thus far,
listen up: MacOS may be ancient, neglected, and full of incongruencies,
but its single-minded methodology paired with Apple's iCloud /really
does/ make it the most effective and elegant environment for most people
to simply /get shit done/. It's clear that many of you have realized the
importance of simplicity for compact and/or educational distributions,
but let me just add that *the democratization of Linux provides a
gargantuan development opportunity to make something that beats MacOS at
its own game* without starting from such a shitty premise and all of its
resulting compromises -- all without detracting from any other
technically-minded distributions whatsoever. /That/ is the magic of /The
Distro/, remember?! If you've existed in a similar state of confusion to
that of my entire adult life regarding the appeal of Apple products --
despite having once been an extensive OSX user, myself -- /you're very
welcome/ for the insight. Instead of paying me for the profound
self-improvement I've just provided, try prioritizing this newfound
knowledge the next time you talk to your MacBook Pro-loving friend about
their workflow. If you're like myself, you'll find their arguments have
magically transformed from the bewildering bullshit they've always
seemed to be into challenges for future competing operating systems to
surpass Apple's old bitch and excel in because MacOS and
[[https://bilge.world/siri-shortcuts-ios12-review][even its much-younger
iOS counterpart]] -- as well as the billions of people who depend on
them -- /desperately/ need real competition in order to maintain their
viability, much less become what products of the world's wealthiest
company /should/ be.

Yes, the manner in which these operating systems are perceived really
/is/ an important discussion prompted by a product as insignificant as
the Surface Laptop 2 because as you read, the industry is bracing for
another /paradigm shift/ in computing, which many believe
(preposterously, I might add) could be as significant and disruptive as
2007's introduction of the iPhone. This machine of Microsoft's and its
“new” MacBook Air counterpart could potentially be the last designs to
carry us to a computing future where the tried-and-true clamshell design
is forgone entirely by the mainstream, but
[[https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/oct/30/apple-new-ipad-pro-launched-all-screen-design-face-id-usb-c-processor-magnetic-keyboard][Apple's
release of this year's new iPad Pro]] prompted even
[[https://supercomputer.transistor.fm/13][the most Cupertino-loving]]
tech commentators to respond with /genuine discord/ along with a few
long-overdue shouts of “/are you crazy/?!” I'm very proud of /The
Verge/'s [[http://twitter.com/reckless][Nilay Patel]], in particular,
for so eloquently deconstructing its usability for all but the very
wealthy. “It is impossible to look at a device this powerful and
expensive and not expect it to replace a laptop for day-to-day work,” he
reminds us in the introduction to
[[https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/5/18062612/apple-ipad-pro-review-2018-screen-usb-c-pencil-price-features][his
full review of the updated product]], along with a beautifully transient
sentiment which I think we all needed to hear again: “I don't think
people should adapt to their computers. Computers should adapt to
people.” Even something as consumerist and bourgeois as the introduction
of another pricepoint-burgeoning Apple hardware flagship can turn a
simple tablet review into a much-needed manifesto for a user-centric way
forward for the industry, which is itself worthy of celebratory
encouragement.

I've favored /The Verge/ and its cast long past the point of excess
throughout the span of my work about technology, but Nilay's review and
its
[[https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/8/18075992/vergecast-podcast-330-ipad-pro-macbook-air-review][accompanying
episode of /The Vergecast/]] are /truly/ special and profound gems of
content that shouldn't be passed up. Apparently -- as the
Editor-in-Chief immediately insists as the episode begins -- his
“ongoing theory” that “the more important you are, the less actually
important work you do, and the more likely you are to be an iPad user”
roused anger from “that whole class of [billionaires,]” but the
experiences behind his argument actually suggest that Apple's own
favorite child of late -- into which it has begun investing and thereby
implicitly /sponsoring/ over its much older brother as the ultimate heir
of the majority's future computing -- has unequivocally *failed* to do
its part in growing the iPad Pro into the “laptop replacement” we'd all
heard so much about. Of iOS 12's performance as an operating system
beneath true work-related tasks, he exasperates “you have to spend all
of your time figuring out how to do stuff instead of doing stuff,” which
I couldn't help but hear as echoes of my own late Linux lamentations. As
thankful as I am to have finally achieved enlightenment of the Planet
Apple, I'm afraid I was pitifully late: its very natural laws underwent
their most brutal tests of the 21st century this past year. Now that
I've finally come to adore the elegant effectiveness of a new generation
of iOS apps like Bear, I'm faced with yet another of the episode's
statements of weight: “I think it's time to stop pretending that the
future of computing looks like Apple's restrictions.” On the opposing
end of the line, the world's first trillion-dollar company's /other/
major product release of 2018
[[https://www.engadget.com/2018/11/09/apple-macbook-air-review-2018/][managed
to disappoint]] even the most fanatical fans of its original operating
system's best-selling platform with
[[https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/6/18064552/macbook-air-2018-review-retina-keyboard-apple-features-battery-price][an
insultingly mediocre update to the MacBook Air]] marque upon which it
[[https://www.engadget.com/2008/01/25/macbook-air-review/][once so
fondly doted]].

My best friend's parents bought her
[[https://www.theverge.com/2012/10/23/3540550/microsoft-surface-review][the
original Surface tablet]] when she enrolled in art school, and her
frustration with its lackluster keyboard (among others) leads MacOS
alternative-seeking users like us to wish Microsoft had started with a
traditional design like the Surface Laptop first. Perhaps Apple and
Microsoft's emphasis on their tablets is nothing but a bit premature for
the /most/ current crop of users, and the rest of my nieces and nephews
will expand upon an entirely different methodology of usership when they
receive their freshman computer. Those elders of us who still take the
Clamshell form seriously and love printing our documents are apparently
facing a future industry saturated with products we can't believe in,
but it's up to you to decide if this issue is worth expending your
energy in advocacy for either camp. With my 120+ word per minute
proficiency with physical keyboards, /I/ for one have been completely
bewildered by the iPad as anything but an indulgence for reading text on
the web, and I'm pleased as punch with my Surface Laptop 2. Even if it
proves to be the last new computer I'll ever own to come as optimized
for my use, I'm just grateful and astonished it happens to be the best
yet.

My girlfriend very generously offered to go for a drive with me
yesterday evening, though neither of us particularly expected to end up
parked at 5:40AM outside a little Diner called Ziggie's some four hours
away from home. I managed to learn a bit about driving apps and briefly
flood my Jetta's intake long enough to stall it after fording some flood
water a wee bit too rapidly.

Since I've begun working in Kansas City and occasionally commuting from
Columbia, I've found incentive to revisit the crowdsourced driving
directions mobile app [[https://apple.co/2PJuh5y][Waze]], which I recall
being very excited about in early 2016. It's smoother now, yet devoid of
that pseudocountercultural sense in a design sense. Functionally, it is
still /the/ most reliable method of police detection I've ever
encountered -- in this Second Era of my Waze usage I have yet to see a
single Missouri Highway Parol car sat in the center of I-70 that hadn't
been reported on Waze first -- even at crazy hours on weekday mornings
-- which should be all the reassurance one needs regarding the immediate
future of their userbase.

[[file:xhtml/https:/i.snap.as/7OdQ3nM.jpg]]

  I'm using Waze to drive to to Licking, MO, arriving at 2:24. Watch my
  drive in real-time on the Waze map! [[https://t.co/b6InZBSRdc][David
  Blue on Twitter]]
#+END_QUOTE

Somehow, I was unaware until this morning that Waze allows you to
“share” your route by generating a link to a web app of theirs that will
live track your progress. Though I can't actually imagine too many use
cases for this, I still think it's cool. Anybody who's interested in
stalking my every move should [[http://twitter.com/neoyokel][follow me
on Twitter]] -- where I'm sure I'll be sharing more drives from now on
-- and/or DM me and just ask me to enable 24/7 location-sharing for ya!

On the topic of mobile apps for those folks like me who's only real
hobby is just fucking driving around, I did actually find mention in a
listicle from a /real motoring enthusiast's publication/.
“[[https://www.roadandtrack.com/car-culture/travel/tips/g6477/seven-best-apps-for-driving-road-assistance/][Seven
Apps That Will Help Improve Your Driving Experience]]” is not exactly
the sort of advisory article I remember seeing in /Road & Track/
considering that it actually only contains one single app even vaguely
related to True /Driving Pleasure/ called
[[http://www.greatestroad.com/][Greatest Drive]].

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  Users contribute their favorite routes and with Yelp integration you

relatively foodist anyway.

** Premium desktop Mastodon clients incoming?
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: section0068.xhtml#premium-desktop-mastodon-clients-incoming
   :END:

Since you last heard from us, the federated social network
[[https://extratone.com/mastodon-eugen-rochko-federated-social-network][Mastodon]]
has scaled tremendously in usership and steadily grown technologically
into an incredibly robust and dynamic platform. Perhaps inevitably,
Eugen Rochko and his gaggle of open source developers have continued to
embarrass the living fuck out of Twitter's team -- at least for those
who've continued to pay attention (i.e. those of us whose sense of
aspiration has yet to perish.)

I planned on getting ahead of an innovative wake in iOS development by
watching closely for the first “premium” Mastodon clients to come out,
which I suspected (quite correctly) would carry the first substantial
risk-taking on the part of plucky social apps to be seen on the
goddamned App Store in what felt like eternity. Unfortunately, I've
ended up far too deep in screenshots/insights from
*[[http://bit.ly/tootios][Toot!]]* and
*[[http://bit.ly/mastios][Mast]]*, creating a bit of an overwhelming
obstacle in comparing and/or reviewing the two without sinking deep in
my regular, pretentious hole. (Though both of them are absolutely
gorgeous, fascinating, and impressive projects which you should invest
in and follow if you're interested in the future of federated social
whatsoever.)

*That said*... I'd like only to mention and
[[https://youtu.be/k7KDk-VV6wc][briefly demonstrate]] the first premium
/desktop/ Mastodon client, */[[http://bit.ly/mastonaut][Mastonaut]]/*,
which I had the privilege of experiencing momentarily last night.

[[file:xhtml/https:/i.snap.as/hFeyH28.png]]

In the interest of brevity (and because I was unable to continue fucking
around for any length of time,) I'll just list some observations:

- The entire GUI experience is distinctly uncluttered (or perhaps
  /barren/, depending on your subjective desires from this sort of
  thing,) but duplicates dearest
  [[https://extratone.com/tweetbot-5-ios-review-twitter-client][TweetBot]]'s
  functionality impressively well considering its age as an
  independently-developed product.
- Keyboard shortcuts! Fuck me, God.
- I love the live-updated instance directory search (above) as a second
  landing for first-time users.
- Though I did actually have to repeat the first-time login process
  after freezing and subsequently force-quitting Mastonaut, I think
  you'll probably place the blame on my own immediate and inpatient
  window management mania considering how smoothly it all went the
  second time around.

To be honest,
[[https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/bear/id1091189122?mt=12][Bear]],
[[https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/spark-email-app-by-readdle/id1176895641?mt=12][Spark]],
and recent other beautiful Mac applications beckon me to buy or hack
myself into MacOS again. If I have time in the near future, I'll show
you why.

You fight your superficiality, your shallowness, so as to try to come at
people without unreal expectations, without an overload of bias or hope
or arrogance, as untanklike as you can be, sans cannon and machine guns
and steel plating half a foot thick; you come at them unmenacingly on
your own ten toes instead of tearing up the turf with your caterpillar
treads, take them on with an open mind, as equals, man to man, as we
used to say, and yet you never fail to get them wrong. You might as well
have the /brain/ of a tank. You get them wrong before you meet them,
while you're anticipating meeting them; you get them wrong while you're
with them; and then you go home to tell somebody else about the meeting
and you get them all wrong again. Since the same generally goes for them
with you, the whole thing is really a dazzling illusion empty of all
perception, an astonishing farce of misperception. And yet what are we
to do about this terribly significant business of /other people/, which
gets bled of the significance we think it has and takes on instead a
significance that is ludicrous, so illequipped are we all to envision
one another's interior workings and invisible aims? Is everyone to go
off and lock the door and sit secluded like the lonely writers do, in a
soundproof cell, summoning people out of words and then proposing that
these word people are closer to the real thing than the real people that
we mangle with our ignorance every day? The fact remains that getting
people right is not what living is all about anyway. It's getting them
wrong that is living, getting them wrong and wrong and wrong and then,
on careful reconsideration, getting them wrong again. That's how we know
we're alive: we're wrong. Maybe the best thing would be to forget being
right or wrong about people and just go along for the ride. But if you
can do that---well, lucky you.

*In case you're similarly long overdue for a reminder that beautiful

After nearly a year of relative sobriety from my old, once-severe
addiction to Web Site hunting, it occurred to me just yesterday that
some explicit wandering as I once did for days at a time -- through the
clever, innovative, and uniquely tasteful projects through which an
astonishingly-original few give their whole thinking (and often
physical) selves in obscurity despite how little financial (and often
professional) incentive is maintained by those who unknowingly need it
the most -- might be the best feasible remedy to my current, most
perplexing state of faithlessness and bafflement toward the ambitions of
trades and cultures I feel I once so thoroughly understood. A great
portion of you are surely undergoing your own manifestations of the same
hopelessness -- I cannot /ever/ remember a time in my life when global

/Speaking of/ Gimlet Media:
[[https://gimletmedia.com/shows/reply-all/xjhx3l/146-summer-hotline][the
latest episode]] of my longtime favorite of their podcasts, /Reply All/,
is a sort of condensed remake of
[[https://gimletmedia.com/shows/reply-all/llhezj][my favorite podcast
episode of all time]] (of any show, not just this one) in which hosts
[[https://twitter.com/AGoldmund][Alex Goldman]] and
[[https://twitter.com/PJVogt][P.J. Vogt]]maintained an open telephone
line for 48 hours and spoke with a whole bunch of people (mostly
Americans) about... whatever. The result was beautifully /human/, if
you'll forgive my use of the cliche. I tend to revisit it when I'm
feeling particularly isolated from and/or confused about the general
ambitions of the people around me. I'll be honest: I didn't pay much
attention to my first listen through the new episode, but I can tell you
that it is worth your time, at least.

I was distraught when Spotify bought both the aforementioned Gimlet
Media /and/
[[https://medium.com/anchor/anchor-is-joining-spotify-70356e3ac23f][the

ridiculously) felt a special personal ownership over. (The latter,
especially, because they reached out to me early on to feature
[[http://anchor.fm/extratone][/Extratone/'s channel]] on their music
section.) However, it appears that both are being treated fairly well in
the 18+ months since their acquisition -- probably because

The year I was given my first generation iPhone was the last of 14
through which my mother was still comfortable enforcing my obligation to
attend Sunday morning church service. She and my stepfather had migrated
18 months or so prior from [Suburban Church of Mediocre Dope
Christ-Appropriated Lukewarm Diluted Prog Rock and The Occasional
Teachings of Protestant-ish Side-Glances at The New Testament] to the
[[https://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/23/movies/how-the-true-false-film-festival-and-a-church-work-together.html][/New
York Times/-appointed champion]] of Columbia Missouri's
[[https://www.komu.com/news/mega-church-growth/][20-Year-Long]] /Quirk
the Church!/ Sovereignty Crusade: /The Crossing/. Like its competitors
(of which my parents' previous church had ranked quite poorly,) the
blatantly death-cult-sounding House of God includes its own artisanal,
latte-equipped coffee shop (I wouldn't be surprised if it's /actually/ a
Starbucks affiliate at this point,) a regularly-replenished catering
table full of doughnuts immediately to the side as one enters, and a
sophisticated childcare operation staffed no less thoroughly than my
public elementary school.

Since 2007, the church has been expanding from its first home (as a
functional place of worship, anyway,) which lies within 1) line-of-sight
from one of
[[https://www.insidephilanthropy.com/dance/2013/7/31/nancy-walton-laurie-ballets-next-best-friend.html][Nancy
Walton]]'s properties, 2) a mile of the southernmost exit off US-63 --
mid-Missouri's primary North⟺South roadway -- and includes a powered
pump-arrogated pond, though the majority of the acreage is blackened by
pragmatically-arrayed big box store-caliber multi-rowed parking. Ye, by
night, it is flooded in coordinately-distributed cold white light
suspended by the same uniform steel poles which guard long-term airport
lots. Naturally, the entry and exit points for the asphalt spread are
arranged deliberately opposed so that four figures' worth of God's
children may be fed, digested, and evacuated through their weekly
appointment with Christ as efficiently and /hassle-free/ as possible.

[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rhSDfm1ZEc]]

God's ~white~ children become /especially/ sensitive to entirely-trivial
delay or other perceived deviation from Their Expectations when inside
an automobile thanks to a rampant misconception that simultaneously
allows them a renewed sense of control over their environment.
Psychoanalytic observation has suggested it is catalyzed by delusions of
physical anonymity, exemption from civic responsibility, and a
titanically-inflated perception of their personally misattributed
contributions to the perpetuation of the universe. This vehicular
component of the customer experience is a fundamental ingredient in /The
Crossing/'s stellar member retinenance record -- the single metric above
all quantifying a Christian organization's overall effectiveness in
accomplishing the faith's (mostly cross-denominational) evangelistic
Prime Directive / General Order Number One as
[[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+28%3A18-20&version=NIV][abridged
by Christ himself]] to the Pharisees after his resurrection: “go and
make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of [The Holy
Trinity].” I did not take the opportunity to sample /The Crossing/'s
baptismal services, but I'm sure sufficient combing of
[[https://yelp.to/qTKq/U3zCk0HlEY][the church's Yelp! page]] would yield
as qualitative an analysis of such a “service” as you could possibly
imagine. (Notably, it would appear the “lowest” review is
[[https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-crossing-columbia?hrid=1iW1Q9KCi9WlM3mDzNFvKw&utm_source=ishare][the
singular 4/5 star entry]].)

I do not mean to disparage /The Crossing/, specifically nor even
organized religion, generally, but instead to emphasize the absurdities
which have leapt just as readily into what I'd specifically call /The
Business/ of white protestant Christianity over just the course of my
own maturation as it has into any other aspect of our lives. The
difference, of course, is the universal set of exceptions -- and the
particular /age/ of said exceptions -- which religion maintains,
societally. The perspective formed by my own experiences having grown up
wholly embedded across the spectrum of white midwestern Christianity --
including two years of vigorous and quite academic study of the Bible in
a tiny private school headquartered in the basement of a Lutheran church
-- lends to a particular skepticism, amusement, horror, offense, and
existential astonishment that latches my fascination into a
not-entirely-voluntary hold.

(Before I go on, I suppose I should also note that it's been at least
two or three years since I last set foot inside the church building at
all -- my /only/ recent experiences/engagement with /The Crossing/ has
been with their digital content from a relative distance.)

[[file:xhtml/https:/i.snap.as/E5RLm4y.jpeg]]
[[file:xhtml/https:/i.snap.as/B8TX5h0.jpeg]]

The ludicrous parallels between Apple events and services at /The
Crossing/, especially, come immediately to mind every single time I
watch one (live or otherwise,) as they did just weeks ago when I first
engaged with [[https://youtu.be/psL_5RIBqnY][this summer's WWDC
keynote]]. Pastors
[[https://www.thecrossingchurch.com/staff/dave-cover/][Dave Cover]],
[[https://www.thecrossingchurch.com/staff/keith-simon/][Keith Simon]],
and [[https://www.thecrossingchurch.com/staff/shay-roush/][Shay Roush]]
all look, dress, speak, and photograph /exactly/ like Steve Jobs, Tim
Cook, Scott Foristell, Jony Ive, and just about any
[[https://www.apple.com/leadership/][public-facing leadership figure]]
we've ever seen giving an Apple Keynote. They're hilariously
interchangeable, as are other explicit aspects of the typical Sunday
morning service at /The Crossing/. As far as I can tell, the church as a
whole /only/ uses Mac computers and the projections in the main
auditorium/worship hall -- mostly sing-along hymn lyrics and referenced
bible verses -- are exclusively created through Apple's office
presentation software, Keynote, just as the company itself does for its
“Keynotes.” This was immediately obvious to me upon first entering that
space because *they both use the default theme* -- typography, color
palette, transition animations and all. Indeed, during the sermons, the
three pastors would take command of the slides by fairly inconspicuously
clicking what I'd imagine must be a very sweaty Apple Remote in the
/exact/ same manner in which Tim Cook and his underlings still do.

*I JUST REMEMBERED DAVE EXPLICITLY USING MENTION OF APPLE PRODUCTS IN
HIS SERMONS*

[[file:xhtml/https:/i.snap.as/s1Qh8Rz.jpg]]

Nay, the likenesses do not diverge when comparing the fundamentals of
the two organizations more broadly: /The Business/ of the faith is very
much a /volume/ business, which also describes Apple's contemporary
strategy with perfect precision. It's been a few years since
“[[https://www.forbes.com/sites/ericjackson/2014/06/03/apple-isnt-a-hardware-or-software-company-its-an-ecosystem-company/][ecosystem]]”
ceased to be an exhaustive buzzword in tech media discourse, perhaps
because the term falls very short in expressing the change in global
Apple *scale*. My recollection of high school biology has failed to
produce a scientific substitute, but I find Matt Honan's
“[[https://www.wired.com/2014/09/apple-ecosystem/][very lovely swamp]]”
exceptionally said in 2014, but the fact of the swamp's becoming
generally lovelier in the interim -- in a less linear fashion than would
have been ideal, mind you -- leaves ample room, I think, to fear and
respect whatever it was that we then called /The Apple Ecosystem/ in
2014 as a *ruling deity or daemon* (just as
[[https://extratone.com/google-soul-ledger-dont-be-evil][Google's sought
to be]], recently.)

[[https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/825951279910440960]]

The church [[https://www.thecrossingchurch.com/livestream/][live
streams]] every fucking +keynote+ sermon in HD on /Vimeo/, not
/YouTube/. (I had no idea Vimeo offered
“[[https://vimeo.com/features/livestreaming][professional streaming
services]]” until this moment.) They have a
*[[https://apps.apple.com/us/app/the-crossing/id436071694][fucking iOS
app]]* (apparently developed by an outfit called
[[http://www.subsplash.com][Subsplash]], who had the audacity to include
analytics meta tags following the /root of their website/ within the
in-app attribution button) which features a calendar-bound tool
containing full-text preparatory reading material from scripture,
on-demand audio and video recordings

[[file:xhtml/https:/i.snap.as/R4Mucv7.jpeg]]

I genuinely wonder quite often if the individual who set the digital
template for the sign in front of our Portland neighborhood's
Episcopalian church paused to look at the text he was arranging: “PRAYER
REQUESTS BY EMAIL.” I'm not sure any of this really means anything, but
it's sure spectacular to look at.

** VW's Jumbo new offering is titanic to live with and genuinely amusing

Upon meeting an elderly recently immigrated German friend of my mother's
for the first time yesterday, she exclaimed /He looks German!... and so
tall!/ Both of these compliments were /relatively/ true, but certainly
not extremely. I am more German-looking than not, perhaps. Supposedly, I
am half a product of a very large family whose elders are only one and
two generations from German royalty -- my legal last name is on a state
sign in front of a small black castle somewhere in /Der Vaterland/. I
slacked through two years of high school German language classes -- Frau
Rosa once took me aside to ask /you're not going to shoot up the school
or anything, right?/ (Sorry Frau & peers.) Though my much-older half
siblings grew up mostly in the town of Schweinfurt, I have never
actually set foot in Germany, yet I've come to identify with and admire
its culture enough to (perhaps unjustly or inappropriately) feel
comfortable joking about Deutsche peculiarities as vain self-mockery.

Despite all of this (carefully nationalism-free) affection, the real
truth of myself is an American one. I have long since broached the point
of no return: no matter how hard I might try, I would never be able to
mold the Me another perceives in such a way that I'd become observably
German-native. I'm just a midwestern boy with a Germanic name on his
paperwork, and therefore have more in common with Volkswagen's newish
entry into the /dramatically/ different full-size Sport Utility Vehicle
segment. The Atlas bears a
[[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-11-17/what-s-in-an-suv-name-redemption-with-u-s-consumers-vw-hopes][remarkably
good name]] (annoyingly,
[[https://www.thedrive.com/new-cars/9083/the-2018-volkswagen-atlas-finally-solves-vws-america-problem][literally
everyone's reviews]] seem to begin with a comment on how /decipherable/
the new name is for Americans) -- especially among new automotive
products introduced to market in recent memory. Honda's /Clarity/
*should* be clever alongside the definitively 21st-century /Insight/
marque, but violates an unfortunately universal law in the industry:
never name a car for a /state of being/ (Introducing the New 2020 Honda
/Ambiguity/ [/Insolence/, /Fugue/, /Debacle/, /Setback/]) ~especially~
one so obtusely irrelevant to the product itself. /Insight/ comes from a
chat with a colleague over coffee, but /Clarity/ is a metaphysical,
zealous plane that sounds our ever-inadequate platitude alarms in a very
unsettling manner. /Um... Is Honda doing okay?/ It not only ends up
irritating and off-putting: after Hannah's season of /The Bachelorette/,
it's just dumb, lazy, and foul.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  After decades of trying to force Yankees into models that many found
  too small, VW has figured it out: Big-ass SUVs are what Americans
  want, and the Atlas is designed around the biggest asses you can
  imagine.
#+END_QUOTE

In contrast, the fucking Nissan /Kicks/ ages so swiftly and
uncomfortably that it's pitifully tacky before it even hits the lot,
which is particularly disappointing considering the most cleverly
bestowed /Juke/ name was. One marvels at the situation Nissan has found
itself in: /young American black men love our brand, but they also love
shoes!/ Atlas, though, is on par with Honda's /Odyssey/ inspirationally,
though a smidge more grounded through the distinctly Earthen science of
topography, just as it should be. Originally billed as a replacement for
[[https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/cars/2013/09/23/vw-routan-suv-crossblue/2856593/][VW's
Routan minivan]], the three-row Atlas is Volkswagen's newest bid for the
Panic Room-loving American parent demographic. Therefore, it's crucial
for us to examine it thoroughly for
[[https://www.businessinsider.com/vw-atlas-crossover-suv-review-2017-11][any
signs of condescension]] from the Germans and their brand “whose
business in the US is built on providing small, fun-to-drive cars like
the Golf, the Beetle, the Jetta, and the Passat.”

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  From our perspective, what we have here is a German take on the
  American family SUV. A Ford Explorer by way of Wolfsburg, if you will.
  Well, sort of. The Atlas is actually built in Chattanooga, Tennessee
  alongside the Passat sedan.
#+END_QUOTE

Unavoidably, the most notable, remarkable, and extraordinary item to
note about the Atlas is simply that *it is fucking fat*. Just about any
review you watch or read will mention this. Even /CNET/ calls theirs
“[[https://www.cnet.com/roadshow/reviews/2019-volkswagen-atlas-review/][a
very broad boy]].” After I first read the number -- *5997 lbs.* -- I was
never able to escape it throughout the entirety of my time with it.
*/Three tons/* is unbelievably, inexcusably, violently, hopelessly
heavy. /Hopelessly/ not because it stands out in its segment, but that
[[https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/457289420174000150/698509904629202996/2017_Vehicles_with_GVW_over_6000_lbs.pdf][/it
does not/]]. Obesity is still a problem in America, but it's our
automobiles now. While we continue to worship safety and fuel economy
together, we skew the triangle (the other side is performance) further
and further, and yes -- a good portion of the blame can be placed on
[[https://www.npr.org/2016/05/09/477301486/why-americans-are-buying-more-trucks-and-suvs-than-cars][our
obsession with SUVs]]. I spent 2018 driving a 1976 Lincoln Continental
Mk. IV around -- the second-longest two-door car ever sold at 228.1
inches from its pointed nose to its massive ass. Despite being a full
/thirty inches longer/ than the 2019 Atlas, my 460-powered mammoth yacht
weighed some 700 pounds /less/, and it was filled with /real wood/. I'm
no expert in physics by any means, but I can tell you that every pound
has
[[https://www.nrcan.gc.ca/sites/www.nrcan.gc.ca/files/oee/pdf/transportation/fuel-efficient-technologies/autosmart_factsheet_16_e.pdf][expounding
effects]] on the energy required to move, turn, and stop a vehicle,
which just about sums up the ultimate formula to
[[https://www.autoblog.com/2009/10/29/greenlings-how-does-weight-affect-a-vehicles-efficiency][pulverize
efficiency]]. When our friends at the IIHS say that “fuel economy can be
improved without sacrificing safety,” they are just... *fundamentally
wrong*, (though /technically/ correct.)

I'm not entirely sure why the Atlas weighs so much, but its mass is
inevitably a major variable in just about every facet of its experience
as a product. The best potential hoot to be had from it as a driving
device should be sought by ordering it to shuffle briskly on curving
country blacktops in Sport Mode with all the assists (save for
lane-keeping) /on/. Not to be too crude, but it's fun to make the fat
fucker run. Through your ass, you can feel the suspension squirm and
struggle to redirect all
[[https://www.motortrend.com/cars/volkswagen/atlas/2018/2018-volkswagen-atlas-se-long-term-update-1-review/][266
lb.-ft. of VR6 oomf between 4 wheels]] beneath an entirely separate war
against the physics of such top-heavy body roll.

/Scrambling/ is definitely the correct verb. Pleasantly light steering
in Comfort Mode (where I'd advise you leave it in virtually any
situation) combined with a supple-ish ride from multilink suspension
provide a trace of a past luxury sentiment not unlike the energy
exhibited by my old Connie through and through. It's all about the
sensation of *power*. Not in the horse sense, but in the satisfaction
achieved from the manipulation of maximum mass with minimum effort.
Comparatively, the level of actual ego-stroking is of course quite
miniscule, and unfortunately, it is the numbness that is most noticeably
left over with very little gain.

Also unfortunate: I did not end up making the opportunity to truly test
whatever offroad capabilities the Atlas may posses in any sort of
formalized test. My example came with Hill Descent Control and Hill
Start Assist, and I was able to find a small hill just steep enough to
[[https://youtu.be/REchJ_BD5G0?t=232][trigger the former]]. I cannot say
I'd put my money on the Atlas winning the Dakar as it is, but we now
know it can handle wet grass on a mild incline. What about county road
gravel? Realistically, these are the two extremes 99% of Atlas' will
ever face in their usable service lives. I found an entirely quiet
section of back rock road and
[[https://youtu.be/REchJ_BD5G0?t=321][walked through the steps]] to
disable all of the traction and stability control assists before
stomping on the throttle, but was unable to provoke any significant
wheelspin. In

episode of /Autoline After Hours/]], Michael Loveti (Vice President,

the drivetrain /really is/ *all-time all-wheel-drive*, (though the dual
exhaust ports in the rear are
[[https://youtu.be/wCTUgQ-X4mw?t=395][unfortunately fake]],) and that
the Atlas is actually based on
[[https://www.motortrend.com/news/explaining-volkswagen-mqb-architecture/][the
MQB platform]], which is astonishing. Prospective buyers should
definitely have a listen.

story. Its horizontal lines match both the Jetta and Ford's Explorer. In
that way, surely it is a success. I cannot imagine a better execution of
its marque's directives as stated by Mr. Loveti than what I drove.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  Cover the Volkswagen logo and you might think the Atlas was made by
  someone else. The hard lines and boxy shape are a sharp departure from
  the rest of the VW lineup. But look at its competitors here in the
  states, especially the Ford Explorer. It's almost like Volkswagen

  Even though it has been on the market for only a year, the Atlas had
  become VW's second-most-popular car in the German automaker's lineup
  in March 2018, showing that the American car-buying public's thirst
  for crossovers and SUVs remains unslaked.

The only other modern SUVs I've spent significant time with was the

(and had absolutely nothing to say about,) so my authority in comparing
the Atlas with its competitors is severely lacking. However, I can at

** The Passive Safety Fairytale
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: section0075.xhtml#the-passive-safety-fairytale
   :END:

*Define*: [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_safety][Active safety]]

*Freedom through security*. In truth, neurotypical people are naturally
driven to minimize risk, yet also to romanticize the sick,
inhibitionless madmen -- to envy them both internally and externally (in
a most restrained way.) Collectively, our authority in (or mastery of)
risktaking remains pathetically irrational. If we were to itemize our
ability to asses risk into a sixth physical sense, it would rank just as
poorly against the rest of the world's creatures (or perhaps
neck-and-neck with those of the squirrel or the deer.)

So many struggles of the too-often-cited “Human Condition” are grounded
in the incompetence of this sense. It shouldn't be surprising, then,
that risktakers in general are a very special topic amid The Middle
Class -- those who occasionally find themselves atop /just/ enough
excess to call it “capital.” This equates in day-to-day life as only the
most potent -- yet almost entirely inert next to the cushion of
multi-millionaires -- subject, catalyst, and indicator of dire fret. By
far the most widespread affectation of this petty affliction spreads
like divine wrath over the upper forty percent of this Middle Class.
Thus, we must ask ourselves /how safe doth the Atlas make me feel/?

My Atlas' interior was finished in Titan Black Leatherette, which sounds
both grandiose and a bit like a kink. “Volkswagen is known for good
build quality and tight-feeling interiors,”
[[https://www.auto123.com/en/car-reviews/2019-volkswagen-atlas-review/65887/][writes
Danny Geraghty]] for /Auto123/, “but I found I was encountering just a
bit too much hard plastic, making for a somewhat dated feel.” Perhaps my
loaner was less worn in because neither I nor my girlfriend found
anything wrong with the Atlas' interior quality -- even after bombing
gravel roads to the point of sustaining a left-rear puncture, we did not
encounter any annoying squeaks or rattles. She spent an entire afternoon
sleeping in the passenger's seat reclined and described it as “comfy.”

Standard with the SEL trim is Volkswagen's “Digital Cockpit” instrument

bespoke graphic design decisions automakers are making now, but at least
you'll be able to tell your friends that your Volkswagen has a digital
dashboard “just like the Rolls-Royce Phantom,” which is, of course, the
ultimate Queen of timelessness in the industry. Perhaps it's telling
that the only layout I found acceptable for the digital dash was the one
with simulated analog needles for the tach and speedo, and how often do
you /really/ use a compass in day-to-day driving? For that matter, how
useful could a digital compass in the speedometer's center hub really be
in an “offroad” situation? It's a bit petty, but I also really despise
the typeface shared across the instruments and infotainment system. It's
just... bad.

In Platinum Gray Metallic, the Atlas looks authoritative enough in a

VW managed to execute a seven-seat SUV with its existing design
language. Though the Atlas is by far Volkswagen's largest vehicle, it
fits neatly within their lineup.

** Road Rage
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: section0075.xhtml#road-rage
   :END:

My only authentic Road Rage experience in some 5000 miles of rideshare
driving occurred on All Hallow's Eve when I stopped -- no more illegally
than usual -- on the opposite corner from a popular downtown Mexican
restaurant called The Nap with hazards and all courtesy interior lights
shining. The car immediately behind me hesitated no more than necessary,
but the Biggest Big Infiniti behind them (a QX80 -- the Atlas'
competitor) just... stopped. There was honking and frenzied, hoarse
screaming of /what the fuck are you doing?/ and such.

I responded with pleasantly amused but relatively-encouraging glances at
the impersonal black mass of the Infiniti's windshield through my
mirrors. I rolled down the Atlas' driver's side window and politely
gestured that they go around me, but failed to coax any movement
whatsoever from the ugly behemoth through at least two full cycles of
the nearby traffic light. There must be some aquatic authority in the
bulbous black ass of the QX80, for no one behind it seemed willing to
pass either. The driver waited significantly longer than you'd imagine
before emerging, huffy. She was wearing a classic poofy black North Face
vest some sort of slate gray turtleneck. Nothing below these were
stimulating enough to retain any memory of. /Uggs?/

How positive are /you/ that the truth has absolutely zero consequence:
contrasted silver-beige eyeliner and little eye contact, dirty-ish
straight blonde hair over a spray-tanned face, exhibiting zero anxious
tics or hesitation. She was obviously the New Matriarch, and she was
obviously /much/ more of an authority on traffic law than I. As she
approached, she scanned the street as one naturally does when they enter
a busy one... except it was completely empty, thanks to her blockade.
She first informed me that I was “not /supposed/” to be stopped there. I
tried to listen and respond with as much sincerity as possible as I
realized all at once that my behavior had genuinely /perturbed/ this
woman -- that her choice to leave the huge hideous warmth of the guppy
wagon to speak as humans to one another required great courage.

[[file:xhtml/https:/i.snap.as/ZATOFIE.jpg]]

I inserted the next logical question which I'd been screaming
telepathically: /can you not get around me?/ I began to pity her when I
then saw in her face the distinct possibility that /going around/ as a
concept had not occurred to her whatsoever. She stuttered a wee bit in
retorting “I could go around, but I don't want to get a ticket.” Here,
one of the most fascinating avenues of suburban psychology is explored:
Guppy Mom is not being ingenuine with this expression, nor has she had
an untoward experience with law enforcement, ever. Guppy Mom did know
her excuse was bullshit -- nobody has ever been written a traffic
citation for carefully circumventing an obstacle in the road. Given the
opportunity to interrogate this kernel of entirely uncompromising
obedience to utterly delusional traffic law superstitions, I think we'd
simply discover a life of unnaturally positive interactions with LEOs.
We must conclude, then, that the source of her fear was either myself or
the Atlas.

Granted, to her I am still a /Young Man/, and am therefore instinctively
programmed to believe myself more informed than literally everyone --
even the very foundational architects of modern civilization. Her Stucco
Highness may have felt a representative of these builders (edgy take:
/she is in fact their servant/.) Her own folks surely complain regularly
about their distaste for disrespect, and my gig-economy, Austin
Powers-looking ass was somehow disrespecting the order laid down by her
would be (entirely fantastical) forefathers. Though her expression of
her quaint fear of such “ugliness” (if you will) is hard-headed, an
ugliest decision of hers (or her kin) idled behind me, its giant
seafood-looking mouth gaping, unhinged. It'd almost be more redeemable
if it was a hardcore, chronic mouthbreather. (The QX80 is actually
[[https://www.autoguide.com/auto-news/2019/05/2019-infiniti-qx80-pros-and-cons.html][powered
by a comparatively oldschool V8]].)

Freedom from fear is the sum desire of all the most primitive
compulsions we share. Ultimately, the only efficient and reasonable
response to Mrs. Guppy's kind in such a situation is to very kindly
oblige, which I did, of course, with great respect and great pity. In
the months since this encounter, I'd been wondering what was missing
from the outline of this Atlas review. I recently realized that it is
this analysis of fear as a factor for the American carbuyer.

Though it has been disproven over and over again for
[[http://www.accessmagazine.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2016/07/access21-01-are-suvs-really-safer-than-cars.pdf][decades]],
consumers often cite /safety/ as their primary motivation for buying
full-sized SUVs. Mrs. Guppy's Great Guffaw led me to realize why this
particularly disconnected supposition/folktale continues to thrive so
uninhibited by the truth: the /brand image/, physical presence, and
actual driving sensation must communicate and “feel” *safe* -- these are
far more integral to buyers' perception of a product than the testable
reality. Even the people of the
[[https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/04/01/the-countries-with-the-10-largest-christian-populations-and-the-10-largest-muslim-populations/][world's
most Christian nation]] do not have faith -- they trust not unless they
see with their own eyes; feel with their own asses. They entrust their
souls to the Word of the Lord, but not their lives to the National
Highway Traffic Safety Administration. (I recently gave both of mine to
NHTSA for All Eternity.)

The two or three nights I spent Uber/Lyft driving around my college town
shuttling Halloween party traffic in the Atlas were expectedly
uneventful. I had to create a preset text message to send immediately
upon connection with a rider to communicate as succinctly as possible
that I was /not/ going to be arriving in the Jetta Sportwagen on my
profile but instead in the Atlas, and to transparently try to make sure
that was okay. (No, drivers are not supposed to do this and you should
reserve the right to bail on a ride should you find yourself opposite my
own position in this situation because nobody refused me.)

I made a point to try and ask most of the riders if they had any
thoughts on the Atlas without sounding like I was just desperately
fishing for compliments on my own car, but I don't remember any
significant thoughts being imparted whatsoever -- certainly nothing
negative. Folks here are just too polite -- they won't speak up no
matter how many times you insist that you /do not own the car/. We
experienced this phenomena years ago when we tried to

no reason to expect young people to have anything to say about the Atlas

Surprisingly, the Atlas carries a rare and precious jewel of automotive
history under its broad, satisfying hood. The VR6 “zig zag” arrangement
is actually one of
[[https://www.roadandtrack.com/car-culture/a9988768/volkswagen-vr6-dying/][Volkswagen
legend]] -- defining icons like the Corrado. As
[[https://www.evo.co.uk/volkswagen/corrado][Dan Prosser explains for
/Evo/ magazine]]:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  ‘VR' stands for V-Reihenmotor, which translates to V-Inline,
  describing both vee and inline cylinder layouts. That is, of course,
  contradictory. The unit is actually a very narrow-angle V6, displacing
  2861cc, with two offset banks of cylinders at 15 degrees to one
  another. Unlike a conventional V6, but exactly like an inline six,
  there's just one cylinder head. The result is a six-cylinder engine
  that's both much narrower than a typical V6 and shorter than a
  straight six. In fact, it's more comparable in size to a four-cylinder
  than a six, which meant it could slot easily into a Golf floorpan. A
  creative and borderline ingenious engineering solution.
#+END_QUOTE

The Atlas' 3.6L VR6 makes 276 hp and 266 lb-ft. of torque. Though
[[https://www.motortrend.com/cars/volkswagen/atlas/2018/2018-volkswagen-atlas-se-long-term-update-3-review/][other

a whole /twenty-eight/ miles-per-gallon on a
[[https://www.pscp.tv/AsphaltApostle/1MnxnEBYwgdJO][live Periscope
stream]] without air conditioning or cruise control through a two-way
simulated 20 minute commute, through which I suffered for the hard data.
My average before resetting the odometer for that feat, though, was
14.7mpg. “Good range and miles between trips to the gas station are
criteria I look for in a good car, and the fuel-gulping Atlas rates low
in this department” may be the blandest statement of all time, but
/MotorTrend/ does have a point -- with the same 18.6 gallon fuel tank
shared between the four and six cylinder models, the latter
realistically has 250 miles of range between fillups, which is pitiful
for a modern vehicle in just about any segment.

Atlas last year,

  It's a straightforward conversion from Atlas to Atlas Cross Sport. In

Normally, I'd be disgusted with such a thing, but from where I'm
sitting, the Cross Sport /appears/ to be what the Atlas should've been
all along. The third row seats in my example wasn't any more comfortable
than that of a 10-year-old minivan, so removing them for the sake of the
second makes perfect sense. According to /Car & Driver/,
[[https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a30186943/vw-atlas-2021-preview/][the

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  Instead of getting 20.6 cubic feet of cargo space behind the third row
  in the Atlas, you get 40.3 behind the second row. Fold that down and
  it becomes 77.8 cubic feet to work with. And that's from an SUV with
  the same wheelbase as the upcoming 2021 Atlas at 117.3 inches, yet it
  is 5.2 inches shorter and 2.2 inches lower to the ground.

There was even a

  Once we got the steering fixed, my opinion of the Atlas did grow
  sunnier, though it's still not perfect. Maybe it's not fair to compare
  the driving experience to my previous long-term vehicle, the slightly
  smaller Mazda CX-9, but in my opinion the Mazda still sets the ride
  and handling bar for the competitive set. Setting the Mazda aside, if
  you hop behind the wheel of one of the newer competitors like the Kia
  Telluride, there's a noticeable disparity in the refinement in ride
  quality and body control in the Atlas... *Volkswagen should have made
  the GTI of three-row SUVs, not just another minivan alternative*.

This pullquote from
[[https://www.thecarconnection.com/overview/volkswagen_atlas_2018][Andrew

ever come up with:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  The 2018 Volkswagen Atlas does little wrong, but it's light on
  personality and a little low-rent inside---and it guzzles fuel. It's
  worth a look, but mostly rivals do more for less.
#+END_QUOTE

Volkswagen's first substantial entry into the SUV market is well-named,
relatively well-endowed, fairly bland for its price tag, and very, very
heavy. Also, Start/Stop is still unbearable -- thanks Obama -- but the
Atlas is not a scam.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  Volkswagen traditionally tuned its suspensions closer to the European
  ideal, firm but well-damped, which incidentally made even
  non-enthusiast Volkswagens more pleasant than average to drive (with a
  few recent exceptions). But Volkswagen made a conscious decision to
  soften up the Jetta for American tastes, beyond what softening
  Volkswagen traditionally applied, and it seems like this philosophy
  scaled up to the much larger Atlas. Maybe the soft ride impresses on
  test drives, but a firmer setup would likely make life nicer for
  occupants over the long haul.

  Why spend so much time worrying about what Medium is? Maybe because we
  wanted to know whether it was a friend or an enemy. The answer is that
  it's neither. It's a reflection of what the media industry has worried
  about, and hoped for, and not received. But Medium was never something
  that we would get to define. Instead, it's turned out to be an endless

** You Need a Password Manager
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: section0077.xhtml#you-need-a-password-manager
   :END:

In 2020, password managers are no longer optional for digital life.
*They are mandatory*. If you only ever heed a single piece of my advice,
ever, /please/ make it this one.
[[https://www.pcmag.com/picks/the-best-password-managers][Most password
managers available]] are secure, cross-platform, optionally cloud-synced
tools that help you generate, store, and organize digital credentials.
More likely than not, you're already using one in your favorite browser.
On MacOS and iOS, Safari is linked to a service called Keychain, which
is -- functionally -- a robust password manager. On signup for a given
website or service, Safari should prompt you to automatically generate
secure, complex passwords to store in Keychain. Generally, it's pretty
smart about knowing when it's time to retrieve the credentials with
Touch-ID, but for when it /isn't/, you should know
[[https://support.apple.com/guide/keychain-access/what-is-keychain-access-kyca1083/mac][how
to manually retrieve passwords from Keychain]]. If you're deeply enough
embedded into the Mac ecosystem, you can feel free to continue to rely
on this process as long as you know how to help yourself when it fails.
I'm not going to tell you who to trust, but I do /almost/ actually
believe in Apple's commitment to securing user data, if only because of
the way their incentives are aligned (in contrast with those in front of
data-funded organizations like Google.)

If you're using a Windows Home Machine and/or an Android smartphone, I
believe it's more urgent that you find a standalone password management
solution immediately. I use a gorgeous app called
[[https://www.enpass.io/][Enpass]] to store all of my passwords as well
as my bank credentials, credit cards, driver's license information, and
anything else I might need to keep handy, securely. I can use virtually
any cloud or file-sharing service to keep my “vaults” synced between all
of my devices: Microsoft OneDrive, Google Drive, Dropbox, iCloud, Box,
etc, and I also regularly create encrypted local backups just in case. I
can even /share/ end-to-end encrypted credentials with another device or
Enpass installation. I migrated to Enpass two years ago after using
[[https://www.consumerreports.org/password-managers/best-password-managers-review-digital-security-privacy-ease-of-use/][1Password]]
for nearly 10. It was intuitive and virtually seamless, as such things
in software tend to be these days, and as a result, I haven't had to
memorize a single password since my adolescence. Enpass allows me to
create custom login templates for quick differentiation when creating
new entries as well as picturized categories and tags. With one click,
even the icon can be pulled from a given URL's favicon to help keep my
vault looking visually itemized. It also includes presets for a hundred
services or so -- from Google to Wix to Yahoo! Japan.

** Total Recall with a Clipboard Manager

Imagine if everything you had ever copied (as in *Ctrl-C*) were listed
in linear order, [[https://vimeo.com/407790756][easily and instantly
searchable]] via a single global keyboard shortcut (*Alt-`*) and
navigable with the arrow keys. Imagine if you could then export an
archive of your clipboard so /nothing/ could ever be lost. Imagine
clipboard /tabs/ that are easily switchable.
[[https://hluk.github.io/CopyQ/][CopyQ]] -- an “advanced clipboard
manager” -- is one of my favorite software discoveries of all time. Some
workdays, I use it literally hundreds of instances in my workflow. It is
difficult to describe how much more useful it makes the clipboard
feature -- something we've all been using for decades, now. For someone
like me who [[https://extratone.com/three-years-of-good-reads][copies a

become /life-changing/.

** Alt-D and Other Keyboard Shortcuts
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: section0077.xhtml#alt-d-and-other-keyboard-shortcuts

Somehow, I did not discover *Alt-D* until 2018, which means that I had
spent the entirety of my 24 years since /triple-clicking/ to select
every single URL I'd ever copied. I built a media company this way, and
I can't believe nobody told me about this shortcut. Open any given web
browser, use *Alt-D*, and your selection will move to the URL in the
address bar on top of the page. It's very possible this will be of
little use to you, but anyone who regularly shares or copies links will
save themselves /so/ much time. I felt the same way when I discovered
text navigation with *Alt*, *Shift*, *Ctrl* + the arrow keys. Most of
these are cross-platform, but I am specifically focusing on
[[https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12445/windows-keyboard-shortcuts][Windows
shortcuts]] for this piece because that's what I'm currently using.

*** Arrow key-related shortcuts
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: section0077.xhtml#arrow-key-related-shortcuts
    :END:

· *Shift* in conjunction with the arrow keys selects text in a document
surrounding the cursor.

· *Alt* in conjunction with the arrow keys allows one to go forward or
backward in a browser.

· *Ctrl* in conjunction with the arrow keys allows one to navigate text
by word.

Virtually all of the “Windows logo key” shortcuts are usable in
day-to-day workflows. I use *Win-D* to immediately minimize all windows
and show the desktop on the regular. Microsoft is
[[https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/17/21224904/microsoft-windows-10-launcher-powertoy-spotlight-alfred-details][currently
testing]] a feature like MacOS' spotlight which is triggered with this
key.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  Designed to replace the existing Win + R shortcut, the new launcher
  will include options to quickly search apps and files across Windows
  and support for plugins like calculators, dictionaries, and search
  engines.
#+END_QUOTE

We can only hope this feature will be as useful as spotlight (which is
triggered with *⌘-Spacebar* for you Mac users,) and will be implemented
as standard as soon as possible. If you're not already using basic
shortcuts for functions like closing tabs/windows and cut/copy/pasting
text, I'd advise you to begin as soon as possible. It can be hard to
commit, but I promise it'll make your life better. Try printing out a
list of shortcuts for your particular operating system to keep by your
workspace and/or find or create an image of the list to set as your

  Bear uses a simple three-paned design. The largest column is devoted
  to your current note. A smaller column to the left contains your notes
  in reverse-chronological order, topped by a search bar. The left-most
  column contains notes that you've pinned, as well as any tags you've
  created to organize your notes ---
  [[https://bilge.world/tag:recipes][#recipes]], for example. I spent
  years trying to sort my notes into notebooks in Evernote, only to
  learn that what I really needed was a faster search box.

As much as I despise the term “seamless,” everything about Bear is its
definition. For someone like me, it, alone, almost warrants a reversion
to MacOS. If you have the correct platforms, I /require/ you to try it.
Unfortunately, there can be no true Windows or Linux equivalent without
the work Shiny Frog has done to streamline Bear's near-instantaneous
iCloud integration, but there is one application that can literally
simulate its functionality in every other way.
[[https://typora.io/][Typora]] is an infinitely-customizable alternative
that spans all three platforms with a well-populated
[[https://theme.typora.io/][themes gallery]] (including an
[[https://theme.typora.io/theme/cobalt/][actual copy]] of my favorite
Bear theme.) My installation is not nearly as /smooth/ as Bear, but it's
technically more powerful -- bad news for users like me who can't resist
fiddling. I've downloaded (and attempted to author/modify) a billion
themes for Typora. Bear, by contrast, allows /just/ enough stylistic
modification (color theme, a choice list of 7 beautiful typefaces, and
sliders for font size, line height, paragraph spacing,) without /any/
access to its internal workings. In this way, it provides the perfect
blend of customizability and minimalism. If you tend toward the latter,
try an ultra-slim solution like WordPress'

--------------

*So I am super curious that you mentioned Markdown as something that
saved you from fiddling your life away. Can you go more into that?*

I started an online magazine four years ago originally on WordPress. I
thought I knew something about web development, but honestly I did not.
It ended up becoming a fixation on trying to make something
/technically/ different from what I'd seen done with WordPress, which
detracted heavily from my Editorial duties over the years. I'm on the
OCD spectrum so I just couldn't let it go. I spent thousands of hours
fiddling with different themes and formatting within those themes, and
what I ended up with was a mess. I would make changes that would break
old posts, so I'd go back and fix those, only to make more changes
days/weeks/months later and have to go back again. I'd known vaguely
about Markdown, but it wasn't until it was mentioned in the WordPress
dev Slack that I really considered it seriously as a way out of what I'd
been doing. I realized that its inherit limitations were actually very
good for me -- that I needed a limited system to constrain my workflow
to keep myself on task. Finally, in late-2018, I started to convert our
old content to Markdown and essentially haven't looked back since.

*Did it take a while for you to accept Markdown's limitations? Was there
a turning point for you? Did you look for a Markdown plugin on WordPress
to help after making the change? I imagine there's something like that
out there.*

There are third-party plugins, yes, but I believe the new WordPress
editor now supports
“[[https://wordpress.com/support/wordpress-editor/blocks/markdown-block/][markdown
blocks]],” which is sortof handy for those who want to continue in that
direction. The turning point was probably when we ran out of money and
lost our account with our hosting provider. I was left with an old
external HD full of old backups and an empty domain. I'd already started
moving that direction within WordPress (largely because of the
[[https://wptavern.com/wordpress-core-editor-team-publishes-ui-prototype-for-gutenberg-an-experimental-block-based-editor][Gutenberg
editor project]],) but losing the site in its entirety was what I really
needed to push us into a more modern, progressive CMS. Honestly,
Markdown is capable of everything we /actually/ need and nothing more.
I'd like to think I was able to realize this from the beginning.

*So you're left with an old external HD full of old backups and an empty
domain. Talk to me about the process then of finding that modern,
progressive CMS. Did you have a vague idea of what you were looking for?
I imagine getting those backups ready for whatever you were going to
choose as another process entirely.*

I actually decided to ditch the backups and just move forward with a
different Editorial direction (the project has since been more or less
put on hiatus.) I knew Markdown had to be involved and that I never
wanted to look at anything like WordPress' dashboard ever again. I
played around with a local Ghost instance but just didn't /feel/
anything for it, if that makes sense. I'd already moved my
[[http://bilge.world][personal blog]] to Write.As months before and
eventually realized that it was just what
[[http://extratone][/Extratone/]] needed -- so far, I've only imported
my own contributions and the most recent work from others.

*Could you explain what you mean by /feeling/ something for a piece of
software? I noticed this in your
[[https://bilge.world/poweruser-tips-software-shortcuts][recent post]]
on your personal blog and what I enjoyed about it so much. There's an
enthusiasm about the software you do recommend that jumps through the
screen. I want to use [[https://bear.app/][Bear]] after reading your
post.*

I'm glad to hear that! I suppose it dates back to my upbringing on a
farm in rural Missouri, where I felt a real affection for -- and
attachment to -- our tractors, combine, and such. When one cares about
their work, I think it's inevitable for them to be emotionally invested
in the tools they use to accomplish it every day. During my brief stint
in IT in the beginning of 2019, I saw a lot of users struggling with
outdated and ridiculously unintuitive software throughout their entire
workday and it made me really appreciate the idea of “good workflow.”
I'm not really a developer, but I believe software can always be better
because I've seen it. As an End User of sorts with not much cash, I feel
like my main contribution back to developers should be celebrating their
good work. This is an idea I feel I do not encounter enough in
day-to-day life.

*As someone who also had a brief stint in IT, I totally agree with the
struggles people go through because of outdated & unintuitive software.
But IT also made me realize how much of software is personal --- someone
will want a solution that's unintuitive to you but is intuitive to them.
You learn a lot of empathy from that.*

*I am intrigued by your last point there --- why don't you think you
encounter the idea of celebrating software developers enough in
day-to-day life?*

I suppose specifically I mean I don't see enough celebration of /good/
development. It's hard to challenge the personal workflow of anyone,
yes, but I hope folks will continue to want to better their lives with
new solutions. As I mentioned in my Tips post, Microsoft Word is a great
specific example of software that simply
[[https://slate.com/technology/2012/04/microsoft-word-is-cumbersome-inefficient-and-obsolete-its-time-for-it-to-die.html][/should
not/ be used anymore]] -- especially in composition for The Web. Not
that Word is /celebrated/, necessarily, but *its alternatives are not*.
It should be noted that I have no specific authority in this matter
other than years of experience with -- and enjoyment of -- playing
around with software. I just think that End Users deserve better than
they get, and awareness of new/different software is a huge part of the
problem. Making average people aware of better solutions should be the
primary function of special interest tech journalism, IMO.

*Great point about Microsoft Word. I don't even remember the last time I
seriously used it --- high school maybe? And like you said, discovery
can be an issue to the adoption of these alternative tools. So are there
any common patterns you've noticed as to how you've come about these
software alternatives that you now use? Patterns that someone could
adopt?*

It's not that I slave away, but it does take a lot of time to discover
them. The simple answer is: I drink a lot of caffeine and hyperfixate on
the internet. I'm not sure it's something the average user should /want/
to adopt, but if they do, they should be [[http://joinmastodon.org][on
Mastodon]]. They should be googling “alternatives to...” regularly, and
they should worship Free and Open Source Software. Accepting that you
never have to settle for one piece of software is probably the
beginning. For lack of a better term, I just love /playing around/ with
software. That's not something I would advocate for my old clients or
other End Users -- I would rather find out myself and then present a
list of alternatives in an entertaining way. I hope that's an
appropriate and sufficient answer hehe.

*No that's great! The acceptance of never having to settle for one piece
of software is at once valuable and challenging to adopt. If you keep
switching you could be a sort of software vagabond who throws their data
into a rucksack to head to the next viable platform. I've always had
trouble trying to find the proper balance between playing around with
software & learning a tool well enough that it can be useful. How have
you personally navigated that? I could imagine your foray into & out of
Wordpress as an example.*

It's always a challenge when trying new things. I obsess over different
ways to accomplish tasks. I've probably signed /Extratone/ for 15
different newsletter services (including
[[http://buttondown.email][Buttondown]] today) though I haven't actually
written a single edition of our newsletter in nearly two years. I think
it's only recently that I've been able to look at these habits from a
reasonable perspective. As in, I am now able to finally differentiate
between playing and being productive, but it took some 15 years.
Self-awareness of one's actual progress is key. Asking questions like
/why am I actually doing this -- for profit or for play?/
Differentiating between these two is something someone like me will
always struggle with, I think.

*The distinction between playing and being productive can be quite
blurry. I sometimes find that playing around with a piece of software
can lead to a productive use of it. How about you? Did you start with
the idea of creating /Extratone/ first and then tried to find the right
software to fit the job? Or did you start playing around with Wordpress
and then the idea of the digital publication took form soon after?*

That's an insightful supposition. I actually tried to launch an online
magazine before /Extratone/ with virtually zero editorial focus along
with a standalone podcast that I'd been hosting on WordPress for years.
I originally began playing around with WordPress sites in my early
adolescence, so you could say it all culminated in the idea. It took
maturity to realize that I actually wanted to build a platform for
/other/ voices rather than continue to invest in my own. I'd like to
believe that was all enabled by the playing hehe.

*So what lead you to the conclusion of building a platform for other
voices? Especially curious from the /maturity/ angle. Because you still
have a [[https://bilge.world/][personal blog]], so it doesn't feel like
you've completely neglected your personal voice. But would you consider
that as not the same investment of time & effort that you'd put into
something like /Extratone/?*

I should be clear that I have /not/ accomplished what I set out to do
with /Extratone/. After a fairly big personal trauma in 2015, I had a
bit of an existential crisis and realized that I had surrounded myself
with so many talented (in a particularly relevant way) online friends
who were producing all sorts of incredible content -- music and videos,
mostly. I realized that I was better at editing and other platform
duties than I was at writing, and that perhaps the online communities I
was astride could be provided a single banner to give themselves. In
that sense, I haven't figured out how to do what I set out to yet.
Ideally, my byline would be completely gone from /Extratone/, so I've
more or less put it on hold until I figure out how to accomplish that.
Turning it into a somewhat profitable media company is still my biggest
long-term life goal.

*The curatorial characteristic you describe is underrated, even though
the “everyone is a curator” idea is jammed down our throats all the
time. There's something about this curation on a person-to-person level
that still has lots of room for experimentation. On that subject, do you
have any examples of communities, sites, or models that guide where
you'd want /Extratone/ to go?*

My citable aspirations in that regard have been somewhat superficial,
I'm afraid. From a technical perspective, I really admired what Joshua
Topolsky was
[[https://www.niemanlab.org/2016/08/newsonomics-sketching-in-the-details-of-josh-topolskys-new-outline/][trying
to do]] with [[http://theoutline.com][/The Outline/]] -- which just
[[https://www.niemanlab.org/2020/04/the-outline-an-attempt-to-build-a-bolder-kind-of-news-site-appears-to-have-met-its-end/][closed
this month]], actually. They built their own CMS including a bespoke
advertising delivery platform which really looked /great/ but they just
[[https://www.niemanlab.org/2018/10/the-outline-built-itself-on-being-weird-but-is-it-weird-enough-to-survive/][couldn't
figure out]] a sustainable editorial focus. In my fantasy world, I have
the connections and digital media insight of Topolsky and know how to
apply them in a way that supports /our/ community because I don't see
any one brand popping up any substantial umbrellas over the electronic
musicians I know. (It wasn't until “too late” that I realized
/Extratone/'s sole editorial focus should have been electronic music all
along.) I read a lot about media but I'm pretty picky as far as hero
worship goes when it comes to my own professional goals. I once promised
that /Extratone/ would /never/ run ads, so I could see some sort of
non-profit classification working out in our future. I believe I could
be an excellent curator -- I'm just not quite sure how to get there yet.

*I think you're a great curator --- had to ask that question of
influence because I think you have a unique curatorial presence on the
web. Just saw you tweet about
[[https://www.tractordata.com/][tractordata.com]]. Who else would
recommend that? Love it. That's why I thought
[[https://are.na/][Are.na]] would be right up your alley.*

*So you emphasized “/our/ community” there --- what do you define as
your community in that broader context?*

Well thank you! That's a question I'm still struggling to define.
*Electronic music* is about as far as I've gotten. I met most of my
talented friends on Twitter over the past 10 years or so and have tried
to contain them in a
[[https://twitter.com/i/lists/1032269790616858625][list]] before. There
are innate challenges in defining such a creative community -- I have
done my best to label without being constricting, but it's definitely
difficult trying to figure out how to provide a flag which everyone
feels comfortable flying. I still think the best I've done to articulate
what I'm trying to say was for
[[https://extratone.com/about][/Extratone/'s About page]]. Most of the
folks I'm talking about are used to hustling their own brand so it's
been a real challenge working on the right way to reach out.

*A flag which everyone feels comfortable flying --- that's a great way
to put it. What I find interesting about your internet presence is that
you defy the idea of flying just a single flag. Along with /Extratone/
you have [[https://anchor.fm/extratone][multiple]]
[[https://anchor.fm/davidblue][podcasts]],
[[https://bilge.world/][multiple]] [[https://dieselgoth.com/][blogs]],
and now you're starting a [[https://mstd.racing/][Motorsports & Tech
dedicated Mastodon instance]].*

*I've been thinking a lot lately about how important it is to have many
online buckets to put your ideas in. One just feels too limiting,
especially if it's solely linked to your legal identity. How do you
think about this matter of identity & expression with your own online
presence?*

That's a very good question. I can't take credit for
[[https://mastd.racing][mastd.racing]], actually -- I'm not sure who
created that server but it's administered by an account called
[[https://mastd.racing/@RaceControl][RaceControl]]. You've arrived at
another one of my biggest challenges. Consolidating my interests has
always been a problem, especially on The Web. Age has definitely helped
narrow them down a bit, but I still can't help myself sometimes. I think
it's ended up alienating a lot of my followers on social because I have
a hard time posting just within my niche(s). I'm not so sure how to feel
about this, honestly. One could argue that I should post whatever I
want, whenever, but /consider your audience/ is also a concept I can no
longer ignore. If anything, I need to learn to let myself be limited a
bit /more/ by those buckets. Once again, /Extratone/ is a good example
of this -- I should've never published app reviews there, but I did.
We're all learning, I suppose.

*Do you feel like you have to even learn to limit yourself on your
[[https://bilge.world/][personal blog]]? It seems like a personal blog
can act as the release valve --- a way of getting around cornering
yourself into the niches that /Extratone/ and other projects require.
You can freely write about
[[https://bilge.world/preferred-writing-instruments][pens]] and
[[https://bilge.world/star-trek-picard-review][Picard]] without feeling
constrained to a single subject.*

I think I'm just now coming around to understanding personal blogging
and the freedom that entails. It's been a long while since I've had the
urge to write about things on which I don't consider myself at least
somewhat of an authority. I think -- like many people -- I originally
just used my personal blog as a guinea pig for messing around with
themes, and I'm just now actually catching up on some of the lesser
items on my “to-write” list. Since we've begun talking I've begun
building my blogs bookmark folder back up and following the
[[https://100daystooffload.com/][]][[https://bilge.world/tag:100DaystoOffload][#100DaystoOffload]]
challenge, which I find immensely impressive. I can't say I'm quite up
to it, personally, but I definitely plan on opening up the taps a bit
more. (I also don't want to flood
[[https://read.write.as/][read.write.as]] with too many joke posts ya
know hehe.)

*That's awesome! You're reminding me of the interesting relationship
between writing & tinkering when it comes to blogs. They both feed into
each other in a strange way. Before, when my blog was on Wordpress, I
didn't care about tinkering around --- writing was my sole focus. When I
moved to my new blog, however, I found myself shift towards creating
apps that extend my blog and messing around with its CSS. So it's
interesting that you've gone the opposite way, publishing more instead
of solely tinkering.*

*What has awoken the urge for you to tackle those items on your personal
“to-write” list? To open up those taps a bit more? Because I can see the
publication mindset, being somewhat of an authority, getting in the
way.*

That is interesting. I'm wondering how many people are in each of our
camps. I hate to be so topical, but the pandemic and being home
constantly has definitely contributed. I've also begun to learn to let
things go, which is an essential skill. Being able to actually kill work
when it needs to die is the real secret. I just built up the strength to
delete the rest of my 2019 list a few weeks ago.

*I wonder also! And hey, no problem bringing up the current situation. I
think it's making me write more also.*

*Want to drill into that practice of letting go as an essential skill
for blogging. As a final question for this chat, how have you gone about
the decision of keeping ideas that you've had for a long time and when
to let them go? It's been something I've been struggling with for
recently as ideas for blog posts start to pile up.*

Self-curation is definitely tough. Generally, it's very hard to let
things go -- especially when I've progressed at all significantly into
research/first drafting, but I know when to kill something if I reread
and am unable to immediately see where I was going. I've noticed that
trying to rekindle interest or momentum in a topic is unusually not a
worthwhile use of time in my case. If I can't get my rhythm back fairly
early in, I am very unlikely to, ever. That said, I think it's also
important to /forgive yourself/ for investing time in something that
won't work out -- otherwise, you will settle for less than what you
originally intended and release something you won't be happy with.

Thank you so much for your time! I really enjoyed this!

*Forgive and forget! That's a great point about rekindling an interest
being a sign of letting go of an idea. I've done that too many times.
This has been a blast to chat virtually David --- really enjoyed your
thoughts and am looking forward to future blog posts and installments of
/Extratone/!*

   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: section0081.xhtml#discovery-is-pushing-boundaries-but-for-what-purpose
   :END:

/Discovery/ may no longer be new -- not even the newest /Star Trek/
property -- but it /is/ new to me. According to the
[[https://web.archive.org/web/20091227080806/http:/www.mtv.com/movies/news/articles/1611063/20090511/story.jhtml][alternate
timeline exemption]] of the J.J. movies, I've been left without “Canon”
/Star Trek/ television since 2005 (or 2155) with the last episode of
/Enterprise/, but I've been looking forward with moderate anticipation
to an opportunity to watch this new entry into
“[[https://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/in-star-trek-discovery-the-future-is-a-simpler-time][the
stodgiest and squarest of all sci-fi universes]].” Though I am extremely
well-versed in Gene Roddenberry's baby, I come to both you and
/Discovery/ with absolutely zero desire to analyze whether or not it is
“Trek” enough, “good” science-fiction, or even “good” television -- I'd
like only to land on your screen between all of these institutions and
their proctors in some unique insight from all of them, without the
clichés, cringey jokes, or unnecessary /Trek/ism. What I will strive to
do is perform [[https://extratone.com/solo-star-wars-film-review][my
Special Duty]] in relation to American intellectual property mastodons
for which I have my own adoration: to determine whether or not
[[https://extratone.com/star-wars-the-force-awakens-review][they should
die]]. I know absolutely /nothing/ about television writing -- the same
amount I know [[https://extratone.com/tag:film][about film]] -- so I
hope I can provide something usefully unique.

I would rather /Star Trek/ *not* have to die, but I wouldn't be
surprised if it's necessary. Without sounding like I have to prove
myself, know that the property -- in particular the history of /Star
Trek Online/'s development -- was a very important part of my adolescent
life. I have watched every episode of every series several times at
least, but I know better than to entrust my entire emotional existence
into the promise of a continuation like /Discovery/. It most fascinates
me how revivals of old names like this go about contextualizing their
dialogue and other elements for today's audience.
“[[https://subslikescript.com/series/Star_Trek_Discovery-5171438/season-1/episode-3-Context_is_for_Kings][Snug
as a bug in a rug]]” is surely not an expression we should expect to
survive the next 250 years of human development, and yet this is
supposed to be an aspirational series? It even made it in the recap! I
should confess now: it is actually /Star Trek Online/ which made me
curious enough to seek out a CBS All Access Free Trial. The marketing
worked very well.

[[file:xhtml/https:/i.snap.as/4Wgb1i1.png]]

I tend to install the game for a few weeks or so around this time every
year just to check in. This time, I was greeted by
[[https://www.pcgamer.com/star-trek-onlines-legacy-update-lets-you-live-your-star-trek-picard-dreams/][/Star
Trek Online: Legacy/]] -- a new expansion featuring /Voyager/'s Jeri
Ryan and /Discovery/'s Sonequa Martin-Green reprising their respective
characters in voiceover roles. I figured out that Michael Burnham must
have been from The New Show fairly quickly, but I was disappointed to
find out that the character was not in fact a trans man, but rather a
female character with an unusually male name. For the most part, Burnham
is simply an outlier in /The Measure of Morality/ Parts
[[https://sto.gamepedia.com/Mission:_The_Measure_of_Morality_(Part_1)][I]]
and
[[https://sto.gamepedia.com/Mission:_The_Measure_of_Morality_(Part_2)][II]].
She accompanies one's character (along with Seven of Nine) to several
different battlegrounds and stories we'd already seen before in previous
episodes -- /when the budget's running low, reuse sets/, but there is
one instance where /we/ are brought into /her/ (/Discovery/'s) world,
which feels disorienting. The whole experience plays like it was forced
upon STO by CBS in order to squeeze as many viewers into our free CBS
All Access trials with as little developmental investment into the game
as possible. Well, here I am!

In Season 1, Episode 4 of /Discovery/, the writers made a
[[https://www.geekwire.com/2017/star-trek-discovery-elon-musk/][very

aviation pioneering Wright Brothers and the fictional inventor of warp
drive, Zefram Cochrane.

I'll spare you further ranting, but... Jesus Christ. I will not believe
that I live in a world where this sort of comparison is acceptable. I'm
not going to freak out because they say “shit” and “fuck” now, though I
do wonder what Gene Roddenberry (though he
[[https://www.nationalreview.com/2016/09/star-trek-gene-roddenberry-was-misogynistic-hack/][wasn't
all that great]], it turns out) would say -- something like
“[[https://youtu.be/x6-UAditg7Y][profanity is no longer a necessary part

[[https://www.digitalspy.com/tv/ustv/a840967/star-trek-discovery-episode-5-fuck-swearing/][Morgan
Jeffery's take]] on this for /Digital Spy/ was an interesting one:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  There's an argument to be made that the old style of Trek might feel
  naive in 2017. But there's another that it'd be a refreshing antidote
  to the times, the Trek we really need right now as opposed to the one
  we deserve.
#+END_QUOTE

I like to watch fellow /Star Trek/ enthusiasts squirm and cry
“continuity” and
“[[https://slate.com/culture/2017/09/how-shows-like-star-trek-discovery-stick-to-canon.html][canon]]”
as much as any reasonable human being, but I'm not sure this sort of
boundary-pushing is actually productive. Is anything being accomplished?
Other than marking /Discovery/ forever as /not/
“[[https://www.quora.com/What-would-Gene-Roddenberry-have-thought-of-the-use-of-the-F-word-in-Star-Trek-Discovery][family-friendly
entertainment]]?” Linguistically, the word “fucking” in “fucking cool”
was used for emphasis, which perhaps suggests there was no other way for
the character to express that level of enthusiasm. In his
[[https://www.indiewire.com/2017/10/star-trek-discovery-anthony-rapp-interview-fuck-1201887710/][/IndieWire/
interview]], Anthony Rapp (Paul Stamets) explains:

If /Discovery/ was “making history,” I'm not so sure what
[[https://bilge.world/star-trek-picard-review][/Star Trek: Picard/]] was
doing with /fucking/ and /pissant/. I'm also not sure it matters at all
in the grander scheme. What other freedoms should CBS feel free to
explore, now that they've said the bad words? What else hasn't been
explored? Bathrooms? Shitting and farting? That has my vote. I really
don't remember as many colloquialisms showing up in the earlier series,
but perhaps that's just because those colloquialisms have since become
part of our language. I'm not the greatest television watcher of all
time, but I got lost in /Discovery/'s plot, and apparently I'm
[[https://slate.com/culture/2018/02/star-trek-discovery-season-1-reviewed.html][not
the only one]].

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  There turned out to be too many of those twists in Discovery's first
  season, and it was frustrating to watch as the writers sidled up to
  new, risky frontiers for exploration, only to suddenly change course
  right when things were starting to get interesting.

Season 1, Episode 7 is called
“[[https://subslikescript.com/series/Star_Trek_Discovery-5171438/season-1/episode-7-Magic_to_Make_the_Sanest_Man_Go_Mad][Magic
to Make the Sanest Man Go Mad]],” and it's the most classically /Star
Trek/ of what I've seen. One of those stuck-in-a-time-loop stories which
truly makes you want to die. What's even better and slightly meta:
playback kept resetting for me at exactly 21:26 and starting from the
beginning while the cat kept stepping on the delete key and destroying
this paragraph. I had to keep watching the man from /The/ Fucking
/Office/ continually kill the captain after the crew parties to
250-year-old West Coast hip hop and /300/-year old Al Green all whilst
writing this over again. I do not like Rainn Wilson invading my /Star
Trek/. He gives Aquariuses a bad name and... beard. “Listen, petunia,
I've been screwed over since the day I was born. I deserve this,” he
says, and I wonder if in fact it is Rainn himself speaking of his
invasion. He looks and sounds like a fucking incel. All of this makes me
wonder if my entire problem with this show is simply that I do not
particularly like its characters.

Relying on /Memory Alpha/ -- a tried-and-true /Star Trek/ fan resource
-- we can examine
[[https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/USS_Discovery][the U.S.S.
/Discovery/]], itself. I'm not so sure about this spore drive shit. If
the NCC-1701 /Enterprise/ was indeed
[[https://www.startrek.com/database_article/enterprise][launched in
2245]], its existence would blatantly overlap with /Discovery/'s, now
wouldn't it? I don't actually care all that much, but here are a few
screenshots from
[[https://www.arcgames.com/en/games/star-trek-online/news/detail/10772124-the-discovery-lock-box!][/Star

[[file:xhtml/https:/i.snap.as/HLtOMGj.jpg]]

Note how much larger this /Crossfield­/-class ship is than the
/Intrepid/-class from some
[[https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Intrepid_class][120 years into
the future]]. Then again, the latter was designed for “long-range
exploration missions” and /Discovery/ is the fleet's flagship(?) Its
“most advanced ship,” at least. The inclusion of technologies like the
[[https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Holodeck][holodeck]] and the
[[https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Spore_drive][spore drive]]
(perhaps the show's most potent plot device,) though, are really
stretching the canon timeline's ability to accommodate them. The
decision to
[[https://www.arcgames.com/en/games/star-trek-online/news/detail/10772124-the-discovery-lock-box!][include
the /Discovery/]] as a playable, top-tier ship in /Star Trek Online/ is
100% a business one, surely. I'm not here to judge, though -- after all,
games are about having /fun/, right? One of /Star Trek/'s ironies has
always been its existence in a capitalist society as an IP within a
[[https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/24/opinion/make-it-so-star-trek-and-its-debt-to-revolutionary-socialism.html][debatably
socialist future]]. (Everybody wants to see their
[[https://cameronharwick.com/blog/the-political-philosophy-of-star-trek/][own
ideal socioeconomic label]] in this future, it would seem.) “What makes
/Star Trek/'s economics fundamentally different, and, in many ways,
fundamentally incomprehensible to us, is that scarcity is no longer a
factor,” says
[[https://medium.com/@dalefranks/is-star-trek-socialist-83f766828b33][Dale
Franks]]. Today, though, /Star Trek/ properties still require finite
resources and labor to produce, and they always have. Atari spent
[[https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/atari-acquires-cryptic-studios][over
$50 million]] to acquire Cryptic Studios -- the original developers of
/Star Trek Online/ -- and /Discovery/ supposedly cost
“$[[https://variety.com/2016/tv/news/bryan-fuller-showrunner-star-trek-discovery-cbs-1201901398/][6-7
million per episode]].” Though the former is free-to-play, it's filled
with microtransactions and about 5 billion different currencies. When
[[https://www.startrek.com/news/ten-years-of-star-trek-online][/Star
Trek.com/ says]] “/Star Trek Online/ is best described as a permanent
/Star Trek/ convention,” they're correct: *it is full of shit to buy*.

There is also /a lot/ of combat, though /Discovery/ seems to have struck
a healthy balance between warfare and other intrigues. It is definitely
/Trek/ in many ways: redshirts die without any plot consequence and all
the classic character flaw tropes are represented. There is the
aforementioned time loop episode with fucking Harry Mudd and even a
mirror universe arc beginning with
“[[https://subslikescript.com/series/Star_Trek_Discovery-5171438/season-1/episode-10-Despite_Yourself][Despite
Yourself]],” in which the crew actually responds to their new
environment and does the research required to blend in with the Terran
forces. This took an ancient /Star Trek/ format and actually explored a
new, interesting avenue within it (the time loop episode did not.) They
even change the /Discovery/'s registry on the hull to read
“[[https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/ISS_Discovery][ISS Discovery]]”
instead of “USS.”

** Complaints
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: section0081.xhtml#complaints
   :END:

There's a reason we all hate Captain Lorca, and why he says things like
“[[https://subslikescript.com/series/Star_Trek_Discovery-5171438/season-1/episode-11-The_Wolf_Inside][sometimes
the ends justify terrible means]]” and
“[[https://subslikescript.com/series/Star_Trek_Discovery-5171438/season-1/episode-10-Despite_Yourself][there's
no way we're asking /these/ neighbors for a cup of sugar]].” I do not
believe in Spoilers, but there's not much reason for me to tell you why,
specifically. Perhaps it is racist and/or misogynist to say so, but I
found it difficult to get as attached to /Discovery/'s characters as I
have to those of series past. Michael is great, of course, though my
girlfriend Sierra surmised that her purpose in the show is to illustrate
that “nobody listens to black women.” Sierra was also quite aggravated
by the misunderstanding and mistreatment of the tardigrade. When Paul
Stamets mentioned that his uncle Everett participated in a Beatles cover
band, we both despaired, for we discovered an entry in /Memory Alpha/
for “[[https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/The_Beatles][The Beatles]].”
If I were to standardize a system of measurement for my television
ratings, /Discovery/'s *cringe factor* would be 9/10. The holodeck
hasn't been invented yet!

Also, CBS All Access' user interface is the worst I've ever seen from a
streaming service, across iOS, desktop browser, and my Samsung
television. It's impossible to scrub, really, or to dictate a preference
for high definition. One cannot navigate backward between episodes
without re-searching the title and navigating through an incredibly
clunky menu sequence. I was able to cast to both my Samsung TV and
Sierra's Chromecast from my iPhone, at least.

** Compliments
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: section0081.xhtml#compliments
   :END:

Despite its failings (including Rainn Wilson,) /Discovery/'s acting is
superb.
[[https://www.startrek.com/article/james-frain-joins-discovery-as-sarek][James
Frain as Sarek]], especially, is the best of the three. I thought it was
especially thoughtful that for the most part (at least in Season 1,) the
Klingons /actually spoke Klingon/ to each other. Given that
[[https://www.kli.org/about-klingon/klingon-history/][Dr. Marc Okrand]]
spent the time and effort to construct a fully-functional Klingon
language, it seems only reasonable to include as much of it as possible.
I also love [[https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Hugh_Culber][Hugh
Culber]]'s doctor's uniform and the “cinematic” cinematography of the
whole thing. It's very much an action show, yet not quite obnoxious.

So, *should *Star Trek* die*? Perhaps it shows my extreme bias, but no,
I do not think it need perish quite yet. From my (white, male, cishet)

Though I grew up on a farm surrounded by (and loving) diesel equipment,
owning a diesel-powered automobile somehow never occurred to me. This is
especially puzzling given the overwhelmingly positive experience I was
privileged to have with one 2014 Volkswagen Jetta TDI Sportwagen over
the past year. It would find me signing up to Facebook groups, using
real Fast Boy terms, revisiting long-lost roads of home, and returning
to my local community in an extremely intimate ridesharing stint.
Throughout it all, the Jetta made me smile much /much/ more than I
would've thought. I found a real love for this relatively simpleton form
of transportation that I /should/ have seen coming, but did not at all.
There is something delightfully indulgent about a manual-equipped diesel
wagon. Even
[[https://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/20/automobiles/autoreviews/diesel-wagon-whatll-they-think-of-next.html][/The
New York Times/]] knows this:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  Auto writers have long tooted the horn about the benefits of diesel
  engines, and a bunch of them have also argued that the old-school
  station wagon is a far more efficient way to haul things around than a
  bloated high-set S.U.V.
#+END_QUOTE

I knew it, too, apparently, long before I actually decided to act on a
purchase. On October 24th, 2012, I Tweeted
“[[https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/261163556073005056][I sat in a
Jetta wagon today. I need one]].” I really did intend on becoming The
Jetta Man (perhaps without the fashion.) In acquiring it, my plan -- and
it was a good plan -- was to cease an era of general insensibility in my
life's decisions by entombing my wayward self within the most sensible
expression of modern automotive design I suspected I could live with.
The wagon component joined with diesel power and a manual transmission
upon casual research. Diesel, manual, wagon -- of the people's car,
these I sought. Nay, /demanded/.

An ex-girlfriend of mine drove an utterly decimated Mk. V Jetta Sedan
which she'd acquired in some sort of dicey deal. I remember finding it
surprisingly robust given its lot, and quite dynamic to drive. We
traveled all over the Midwest in it -- from central Missouri to Des
Moines to Chicago to Kansas City and back again. I mocked, but it was
everything one could hope for in cheap transportation and quite a bit
more. It turns out, Volkswagen was shooting high. As Tony Quiroga
[[https://www.caranddriver.com/reviews/a15129377/volkswagen-jetta-review-2011-volkswagen-jetta-first-drive/][recalls
for /Car & Driver/]]:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  During the press launch of the outgoing Jetta back in 2005, Volkswagen
  touted that car as a less expensive alternative to an Acura TSX or
  Volvo S40. Volkswagen pointed to its growth in size, high-quality
  interior, new rear suspension, and refined demeanor as evidence that
  the Jetta had moved out of the Honda Civic and Toyota Corolla class.
#+END_QUOTE

In terms of *premium* compacts, my experience is quite limited, but it's
no wonder the company has struggled to find a place in the market for
this product: in German, “Volkswagen Jetta” literally means
“[[https://www.roadandtrack.com/car-culture/a24487598/volkswagen-golf-jetta-passat-polo-name-origin/][people's
car jet stream]].” The first component is infamous, of course, because
of the Nazis and their
[[https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/volkswagen-is-founded][horrid
Beetle]], but the second seems to be almost entirely unknown. In my
research, I had to specifically investigate the Jetta's name before
reading anything about it. When an American thinks of “Jetta,” they
unconsciously dissociate the word from the “jet” sound and make
[[https://carstereotypes.com/car-stereotypes/volkswagen-jetta-stereotypes/][largely
unsophisticated jokes]]. (It's also /Regular Car Reviews/'
[[https://youtu.be/2KZb545b4MU][most hated car]].) Now, the name has
become a marque in and of itself: in China, Volkswagen
[[https://www.volkswagen-newsroom.com/en/press-releases/jetta-brand-successfully-launched-in-chinese-market-5647][began
selling several different models]] under the JETTA brand last year. This
also was news to me, and /I/ try to keep up with the industry.

In 2011, the Mk. VI Jetta was
[[https://www.motortrend.com/cars/volkswagen/jetta/2011/2011-volkswagen-jetta/][released]]
with an outdated base, 115-hp powertrain and a “hard plastic [interior]
that wouldn't look out of place in a Chrysler Sebring.” (Quiroga
insults, to clarify.) Compared to the Mk. V, “Volkswagen made it clear
that the targets are once again the strong-selling Civic and Corolla.”
Once again, I'm at a loss for experience in the equivalent
extra-Volkswagen competition, save for the
[[https://youtu.be/40x4TF-6ggc][Chevrolet Cruze]] and Kia Forte.
(Surprisingly, GM actually produced a diesel version of the Cruze and
[[https://youtu.be/dH-FZyKTY3s][/AutoGuide/ compared it against the
Jetta TDI]].) It's been too long since I last drove my ex's Mk. V to
really have much to say, but I do remember a particular solidity about
the steering -- perhaps because it was still hydraulic. Once again, I'll
rely on Tony:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  Less obvious cost cutting includes the loss of adjustability for the
  center armrest, a lack of lumbar adjustment in most models, no more
  power-reclining seatbacks, and a simpler stability-control program
  that can no longer be shut off or even reduced.
#+END_QUOTE

When I began searching for my first ever truly modern car in February
2019, I surprisingly only needed to pass up a single option in the
Kansas City area before I found The One: a 2014
post-[[https://youtu.be/SvokGhOaHGg][Dieselgate]] example with ~65,000
miles on its odometer in “Deep Black Pearl” with a “Cornsilk Beige”
interior which had been previously owned only by a single Michigan
cyclist. I'd been without a car since dailying/living in a
[[https://www.instagram.com/p/BiYABpKAJQX][1976 Lincoln Continental]]
the year before, in Portland, and my friend had driven me around
everywhere in his Wrangler for a full month (thanks, Jack!) I'd walked
around and cold-idled another, high-mileage Sportwagen, but I was
committed to getting something with a light-colored interior after the
red velvet cake Lincoln and my dank smoking room-dark XJR.

[[file:xhtml/https:/i.snap.as/HRE2hlh.jpg]]

Three of us walked into a dealership in the middle of a frigid Kansas
afternoon -- Jack, my girlfriend Sierra, and I. We hovered by a smart,
gleaming little Golf GTI whilst my salesman, Charles, retrieved the car
I had found online. After he finished copying my driver's license while
the little diesel warmed up, the four of us set off into suburban
Lawrence. Back when the Mk. VI Golf was released, I attended a
Volkswagen dealership event in which Mk. V and Mk. VI GTIs were driven
back-to-back -- I'm assuming to reassure buyers that yes, they /really
had/ made it better (though I was quite vocal in my disagreement about
this, to the dealer's chagrin.) The car I bought immediately reminded me
more of the former -- perhaps I just enjoy the increased body roll of a
50,000+ mile suspension -- albeit with a much longer wheelbase and
significantly more torque. Rowing through the gears, I was immediately
impressed and bewildered by the characteristics of the 140-horsepower,
236 lb.-ft.-developing diesel powerplant. The diesel engines I grew up
around in tractors, combines, and other heavy machinery were designed to
more or less remain at a constant, relatively low RPM for the majority
of their use cases. It's not a screamer, but the idea that a diesel
engine can /rev/ at all was something that took a bit to wrap my head
around. However, it is almost immediately evident that carrying on to
the 6000 RPM (?) redline is a futile and incorrect practice. There is
nothing at all to be found up there.

I've driven some quick straight-line cars in my time, but none of them
have delivered their power anything like the Jetta's long-distinguished
2.0L inline-four. It's very odd having comparatively so little actual
horsepower, yet so much torque -- I'd heard Jeremy Clarkson complain
about diesel power coming in “great lumps,” but I'd already started to
find them extremely (and positively) amusing in my first few minutes.
When asked, the oil burner will produce protracted front tire squeal and
torque steer from a stop, which is odd and hilarious coming from such an
otherwise docile automobile. Also hilarious: Charles likely noted that
Jack, Sierra, and I were (and are) entirely unafraid of facing The End
when a very near collision during our test drive did not perturb us in
the least, but left him huffing and puffing from adrenaline. He was a
star, though, throughout the more than four hours of deliberations
required for his institution to reckon with my credit history.
Eventually, I ended up spending almost exactly $12,000, which was
probably too much, and named my new automobile Martin -- “Marty” for
short -- after Martin Winterkorn, the former CEO of Volkswagen AG who
[[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-05-03/ex-vw-ceo-winterkorn-charged-by-u-s-in-diesel-cheating-case][bore

chairwoman Edith Ramirez. To be technical, the powerplant is a 2.0L

turbodiesel four-cylinder. “The EA 189 was one of the most important

My own views on Dieselgate are entirely irrelevant, but I will note that
buying back a buyback car for such a price felt like a favor to my
dealer and that it's pretty cool to have my own copy of
[[https://www.vwdiesellookup.com/pdf/VWCourtSettlement_Emissions_Disclosure_Gen2_Automatic_Final.pdf][VW's
Extended Emissions Warranty Notice]], not to mention the fact that I
actually made use of it (which I will discuss later.) From my
perspective, the automotive industry is /the/ most heavily-regulated
business space in the world and I'd suggest a company like the
Volkswagen Group feeling like they should cheat on emissions testing
might indicate that the standards of the test could be unreasonable
and/or unrealistic.

After returning from almost two hellish, extremely confusing years in
Portland taking public transport, Martin became a vehicle for a
rediscovery and newfound appreciation for my Missouri home -- the great
Missouri River, especially. Not since owning my Miata had I driven so
much in the country. Sierra and I
[[https://www.instagram.com/p/BuP3y62laon/][visited Cooper's Landing]]
in the wet and ventured down to Springfield, Missouri (very far South,)
near which we discovered
[[https://dieselgoth.com/race-day-at-hodges][Hodges Speedway]] -- a
[[https://www.facebook.com/AsphaltApostle/videos/10218812861450693][then-abandoned
dirt oval]] surrounded by demolition derby casualties and the large
trucks used to haul them around.

[[file:xhtml/https:/i.snap.as/Yjq0MbT.jpg]]

Somewhere North of Kansas City, I opened the taps all the way on a very
long straight and reached 125mph, which is either the aerodynamic VMax,
an electronically limited limit, or both. Surprisingly, the modern
People's Car feels quite stable at this speed -- were it not my own
automobile, I'm not sure I wouldn't just travel this fast everywhere. In
the past few years, Interstate 70 -- which cuts Missouri just about in
half from West-East, connecting St. Louis and Kansas City with my
hometown in the center -- has become significantly faster-paced than I
remembered it before moving to Portland for two years. 80mph used to be
the accepted number, 70 (the actual speed limit) was the unenforced
minimum. In my old Toyota pickup, I could travel at 65 without
attracting too much criticism. /Now/, however, one must maintain 85 to
keep up with traffic, especially when traveling with commuters. 90-95
will no longer garner judgmental looks and 100mph left-laners are given
a pass.

“I'll bet that's great on the highway” is probably the most regular
comment received from passersby and riders right after “is this a
diesel!?” (Really, the fact of my Jetta's existence as a manual-equipped
diesel wagon seemed to utterly astound a great many people.) There is
truth in this general supposition: the ability of the diesel powerplant
to deliver hill-climbing torque at low RPM is simply unmatched by
gasoline powerplants of the same displacement, which means that
“highway” driving entails virtually zero downshifting -- arrive in sixth
gear, set the cruise control, take a nap. Everything else is taken care
of. There is a definite luxury in the knowledge that one is no longer
needed in the process at speed -- luxury that is NOT present in a
gasoline-to-manual Jetta drivetrain. From

“Diesel engines are typically poor when it comes to power to weight
ratio, as their high compression ratio and torque output demands heavier
materials in their construction,” notes Lewin Day, meaning /steel/
engine block. Here we arrive on my singular dissatisfaction with the
Jetta: *its weight*. While traveling from Kansas City back home in the
East one day, I decided to satisfy a longtime bucketlist item and stop
by a weigh station. As I drove up to the scale, the police-uniformed
attendant looked up at me from his glass box and gave
[[https://twitter.com/rashadpls/status/650114296937058304][the standard
white guy smile frown]]. It took a moment for the scale to register
Martin, but it eventually displayed a whole *3440* *lbs*. My little
“compact” wagon... weighed significantly more than one and three-quarter
tons -- just 528 lbs. less than the
[[https://www.instagram.com/p/BJPe6rWAcnr/][full-sized, supercharged
V8-powered Jaguar saloon car]] I call the automotive love of my life,
and almost a full 200 lbs. more than
[[https://www.caranddriver.com/reviews/a15129379/2011-volkswagen-jetta-gli-20-tsi-review/][its
GLI sedan sibling]]. There was one single advantage to this weight: we
were able to use Martin as a ballast to help
[[https://www.instagram.com/tv/BwBEetwlUEF][re-spool the winch cable on
Jack's Wrangler]].

After discovering this figure, I did what I could to diminish the weight
easily without tearing into the seats or removing some of the car's
/fourteen/ airbags. Upon lifting up the base of the “car-go” area in the
rear, I found a /full/ steel spare wheel -- some 30 lbs of it at least
-- which I immediately removed, along with some sort of flapping cargo
restraint that I can only suspect was designed to keep objects (like
dogs, perhaps) in the cargo area from sailing into the passenger
compartment during an accident (it's called the “luggage compartment
cover” in the
[[https://eileenlong-my.sharepoint.com/:b:/g/personal/david_eileenlonglcsw_com/Ecdms0tdr6dBoMWScrKX8PsBkIJMmYNjOfzFX3oy-UUO-A][owner's
manual]].) Ideally, I intended to one day strip out all of the interior
except for the driver's side chair, but it ‘twas not intended to be.

After driving the Jetta for about a week, I was on the short commute
back home from the office when I noticed that the cooling fans were
running at what sounded like maximum capacity. Then, at a red light, I
felt some rough dips in the engine's idle. When I reached home minutes
later, I turned off the ignition and removed the key only to find the
fans still spooling. I was convinced I had already broken the car
somehow in rough driving, but in reality, Marty was in the process of
[[https://dieselnet.com/tech/dpf_regen.php][Diesel Particulate Filter
(DPF) Regeneration]] -- a procedure designed to clean the little shitpot
under the hood by heating it up some thousands of degrees to burn off
built up diesel exhaust soot. At least, this is the way I understand it.

Otherwise, I disagree with most reviews about the “diesel rumble” being
bothersome. Perhaps it's because this is by far the most modern car I've
ever spent this much time with -- the /only/ car I've ever spent so much
consecutive time with, in fact -- or because I did, indeed, grow up
sitting (and standing) right next to 8-liter turbodiesels at full chat
for hours on end. Compared to my mother's 1.4L gasoline-powered Mk. VII
sedan at idle in her garage, there is a more pronounced clacking, but
it's nothing you'd have any trouble sleeping through. I would know!
Whilst driving for Uber and Lyft through one of the
[[https://www.therolladailynews.com/news/20190926/second-hottest-august-ever-wettest-january-to-august-on-record][warmest

the (averagely effective) air-conditioning on. I idled when I wasn't

** Ridesharing

   :END:

For more than six months, my primary income was from Uber and Lyft
driving around Columbia, MO -- a distinctly academically-dominated
demographic. Frankly, I can't think of any vehicle more suited to what
ridesharing actually entails than a diesel Jetta wagon. It's a
relatively spacious and comfortable place to be for four adults --
certainly when no trip lasts longer than thirty minutes -- with a
ridiculously stout cargo capacity. I was able to fit /9/ freshman
fraternity guys in for a short trip once. Their faces were all genuinely
somber as one expressed “it's really hard having 8 friends when we try
to go out.” (No, you're not supposed to accept those rides.) It was a
challenge carrying some 1500 lbs. of Sad Boys, mostly for the brakes.
Once, a group of young men and women began to make fun after noticing
the DIESELGEEK decal I'd stuck on my side's rear quarter window (which
I'd acquired with a new
[[https://www.dieselgeek.com/products/high-performance-vw-shifter-shaft-bushings-for-mk4-golf-jetta-new-beetle?variant=6292541866027][shifter

themselves, to which I responded: “you know, it's so weird you mention
that because I know this place that sells these stickers...” They no
longer seemed amused.

All of the cars I've owned have been attention-grabbing in their own way
-- my old Toyota pickup was adored by the locals; my Miata was adored by
other Miata owners. My XJR was gorgeous and my Swamp Continental seemed
to be passionately coveted by absolutely everyone over 40. With the
Jetta, though, I did not expect any unusual attention whatsoever, yet I
must confess that more conversations were started about it than of all
of the others, combined. Ridesharing will do that, yes, but it is
ridiculous how many people of all races, classes, and ages were enamored
by -- or overly curious about -- Martin.

Early one morning, a ride was requested from the local news station just
out of town -- a fascinating place. News vans parked in a converted
horse stable. They farm televisions out there. A few minutes into the
ride, after picking up the young woman, I noticed in the rearview mirror
out of my eye's corner that she had put down her phone to watch my right
hand with total bewilderment. Eventually, she asked “what are you doing
to the car?” She'd never heard of a manual transmission before. I did my
best to explain, but when she asked “but why wouldn't you just buy a
regular car?” I did not have a sufficient answer. Unlike many automotive
enthusiasts, I think it's totally okay that people are allowed to exist
independent of this knowledge. There are many, many other things in life
to worry about.

cars sold in the United States]] are shipped with automatics and
expecting every young person who lives in an urban environment to think
about automobiles as anything beyond simple transportation is asking a
lot.

While we're on the topic of manual transmissions, it's relevant to
mention how excellent the Jetta TDI is as a vehicle to teach first
timers how to operate one. With the clutch in, the engine will not rev
beyond 3500 RPM thanks to an electronic limiter, which dramatically
reduces the number of obligatory stalls when learning clutch control.
The learner can simply hold the accelerator to the floor as they get the
hang of declutching instead of having to receive shouts of “more gas!”
repeatedly. Of course, being a diesel further eases those stresses with
much more readily available torque. Sierra was able to grasp the basics
this way in a /single night/, which is unprecedented in my experience.
She found particular comfort in the suggested gear indicator on the
instrument panel's main information display, which is very conservative,
naturally, but also apparently relief from some great anxiety regarding
the question /which gear should I be in right now/?

I have derided Facebook for my entire adult life for its shitty design,

but strangely, through Jetta ownership, I was able to find a community

** Performance
   :PROPERTIES:

For the first time in my personal automotive history, I felt the desire
to modify one of my own cars. Perhaps the most famous appearance of the
Jetta Sportwagen in The Web Era was driving instructor Austin Cabot's
2014 Sportwagen in [[https://youtu.be/x3HwWn55MJY][one of Matt Farah's
infamous /One-Take/s]]. You can find the full list of modifications on
[[https://www.wheelwell.com/austin-cabot/im7/2014-volkswagen-jetta-sportwagen][the
car's /WheelWell/ page]]. I intended to emulate Austin with a few
modifications including Dieselgeek's
[[https://www.dieselgeek.com/collections/vw-short-shifters/products/sigma-6-six-speed-short-shift-kit-for-vw][Sigma
6 shortshift kit]] and “high performance”

bushing kit]] (which I did get around to buying, but never installed.)
For those interested in engine/ECU tuning, Malone Tuning has a

Instead of installing the shortshift kit right away, I decided to
splurge on a bespoke
[[https://www.ecstuning.com/b-raceseng-parts/ashiko-shift-knob-red-texture-no-engraving-vw-audi-adapter/08311421~rsg][Raceseng
Ashiko weighted shift knob]], which made throws immediately better. The
issue these products are combatting is the particularly disconnected
gearshift which Volkswagen has been notorious for the past few decades.
The best way I can describe it is that it feels like you're just
operating a lever instead of shifting a transmission, if that makes
sense.

(removed, in other words) the (likely) faux-leather shift boot after
realizing that I've always hated the sound and sensation of them, but
hadn't been willing to modify my previous cars in /any/ way. It sounds
ridiculous, but it's actually quite personally noteworthy that I was
able to traverse the unseen boundary into /mod culture/. The result was
a slightly more mechanical-feeling shift that would've certainly been
[[https://youtu.be/Rh02yxy9SbE][vastly improved]] by installation of
Dieselgeek's kit.

Another aspirational goal of mine for Martin:
[[https://www.ecstuning.com/b-h-and-r-parts/sport-springs-set/54751/][H&R's
Sport Springs Set]] paired with a set of
[[https://www.tirerack.com/tires/tires.jsp?autoMake=Volkswagen&autoModClar=TDI&autoModel=Jetta+Sportwagen&autoYear=2014&partnum=055WR6FHI5&tireMake=Firestone&tireModel=Firehawk+Indy+500][Firestone
Firehawk Indy 500s]]. The goal was to sure up some of that body roll and
torque-induced wheelspin. I suspect the result would've been a very,
very sticky Martin. Unfortunately, I would not get the chance before I
killed him in an accident on December 22nd of last year.

The joy my Sportwagen brought me was not expected. My plan to make
myself a more reasonable person (and driver) by buying a “boring” car
was obviously foiled by the diesel's torque, the community's dynamism,
and my own communion with mod culture. I spent more consecutive time
driving the Jetta than I have in any other automobile and was able to
truly enjoy it. After my experience owning a diesel-powered Volkswagen,
I would very much like to try driving/owning the

I made a point to maintain my total ignorance about the origin of

I have no idea why I signed up to attend Microsoft's virtual 2020 Build

** Microsoft Edge Chromium
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: section0084.xhtml#microsoft-edge-chromium
   :END:

As an Office 365 administrator, I basically only use Edge for
administrative/management tasks. Otherwise, I can't imagine a reason to
use it over Firefox, Brave, Vivaldi, Chrome, Opera, etc, but I thought
I'd give the “new” (as of January) Edge a tryout for your sake and make
it my default browser for a day as well as Microsoft's Bing search
engine. There's also news specific to Build:
[[https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/19/microsoft-edge-gets-a-pinterest-integration-sidebar-search-and-automatic-profile-switching/][Edge
is integrating with Pinterest]], of all things:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  Now, Edge will feature a Pinterest-powered tool that will show
  suggestions from Pinterest at the bottom of a collection. Clicking on
  that, Microsoft says, will take users to a Pinterest board “of
  similar, trending Pins so users can quickly find and add ideas
  relevant to their collection.” Users will also be able to export
  collections to Pinterest.
#+END_QUOTE

I'm in no position to “test” a browser, but the new Edge is noticeably
faster at rendering pages and much /much/ smoother when navigating
between tabs/preference windows. It looks much more like Chrome, which
makes sense. Perhaps because my install is absent of third-party
extensions, opening new tabs and windows was much faster than my other
browsers. I recorded a [[https://vimeo.com/420430704][~2 minute demo]]
of normal browsing on
[[https://extratone.com/microsoft-surface-laptop-2-review-windows-future][my
Surface Laptop 2]].

#+END_HTML

In terms of touch support, Edge remains the only acceptable browser on
Windows 10. If you've spent money on a new PC recently, chances are your
device is touch-enabled. If you're like me, you've already
[[https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4028019/windows-enable-and-disable-your-touchscreen-in-windows-10][disabled
it]]. If not, you'll find scrolling and navigation in Edge have improved
tremendously -- it's like an entirely new browser
[[https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/6/18527550/microsoft-chromium-edge-google-history-collaboration][because
it is]].

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  Because Edge used a different rendering engine than Chrome or Safari,
  it meant that it would sometimes have problems on websites. Testing a
  website against multiple browsers has always been difficult, and
  because Edge had so little uptake, it meant optimizing for it often
  fell off the priority list for web developers.
#+END_QUOTE

I really like how easy it is to mute audio from tabs and how much better
[[https://write.as][my CMS]] is rendered. I still prefer Firefox's
method of tab switching (by last-used chronologically instead of in the
order presented.) The reader view is smoother than its competitors and
offers a beautiful selection of themes as well as the best “Read aloud”
feature in the business.

[[file:xhtml/https:/i.snap.as/jWqG85f.png]]

I'm not going to quote you measurements -- check out
[[https://www.computerworld.com/article/3513973/microsofts-new-edge-browser-third-times-the-charm.html][/Computerworld/'s
browser review]] for that -- but I can say that Edge Chromium is using
more RAM than Firefox but a bit less than Chrome.
[[http://office.com][Office.com]] also looks and works incredibly well.
Overall, I'm extremely impressed with Edge Chromium and the improvements
to Bing. As of my experiences today, it's the fastest and smoothest web
browser I have, which is a complete flip from that of the old Edge.

to OpenTube]] (for now.) One commenter (on the since-taken-down YouTube
video) echoes what I'm about to tell you: “My god! I thought I dreamed
this movie up as a kid. I have been trying to describe this to people
for years and here it is, it's real!” In order to write this, I joined
the [[https://discord.gg/X3bAngj][Stephen King Wiki Discord server]] and
was immediately welcomed with a request not to type in the text
channels: “I'm working on adding some new channels so pls nobody type in
them til I'm done.”

/The Langoliers/ begins with a pissed-off British secret agent (Mark
Lindsay Chapman,) an insane businessman (Bronson Pinchot,) a psychic,
vision-impaired young woman (Kate Maberly,) Sarah Jessica Parker
(Patricia Wettig,) and a /just/-widowed pilot (David Morse) all boarding
the same redeye flight to Boston -- American Pride Flight 29. This group
falls asleep and mysteriously wakes up alone on the aircraft except for
Stephen King himself (Dean Stockwell,) a stupid incel violinist
(Christopher Collet,) and a stoner (Kimber Riddle.) My favorite
character, Craig Toomey, is the “twerp” business boy with daddy issues
who can't stop himself from demanding to know what's going on. James
Bond shuts him up with a “nose hold.”

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  Whoa. No one's driving the plane!
#+END_QUOTE

David Morse proceeds to try and contact air traffic control in a
fairly-realistic manner, but is unable to receieve any radio signals at
all, even from Strategic Air Command. Frankie Faison plays the single
person of color on the flight, Don Gaffney -- “a tool and die worker for
Hughes Aircraft” -- who dies first, of course. James Bond lecures David
about inciting panic and almost immediately reveals his secret identity.
Then, the Hungry Idiot (Baxter Harris) wakes up whilst Toomey begins
screaming again.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  Scaring the little girl? Scaring the little girl?! Lady, we're
  diverting to some tin-pot airport in the middle of nowhere, and I've
  got better things to think about than scaring the little girl!
#+END_QUOTE

After the entirety of the male cast threatens to beat him up, Toomey,
sweating his balls off, begins slowly tearing strips of paper and
moaning sexually like an absolute madman. Some irritiatingly irrelevant
dialogue insues in which Stephen King Author Man narrates through
Sherlock Holmes deduction to figure absolutely nothing out. He is
wearing stripes on plaid. He suggests that the entire situation could be
some sort of government experiment and I can't believe I'm wasting your
time with this. “If it were just this plane, I could give you a
scenario, but unfortunately, it's not just this plane. The city of
Denver is probably still down there, but all its lights were off if it
was.” Here you can see how excellently

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  I've been sitting here running all these old stories through my head.
  You know, time warps, space warps, alien raiding parties. I mean, we
  really don't know if there's anything left down there, do we?
#+END_QUOTE

Sarah Jessica Parker reveals to Powers Girl that she's on her way to
meet a guy she's been emailing with. Stoner girl asks if everything is
going to be okay and Incel Violinist looks horny. She's going to rehab
for stones. The captain announces to his nine passengers that they're
beginning their descent into Bangor International Airport, near Stephen
King's birthplace. Don asks Toomey to stop ripping up paper and the
useless food addict yells “well, at least we'll be able to get some chow
when we land” offscreen. Craig, sweating even more, is still ripping up
magazines in the face of Don's threats. “Try it, you little jackass,” he
says. I'm wondering where I can snag this American Pride livery for
Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020. Director Tom Holland manages to add
drama to a more-or-less routine landing.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  This place is utterly, totally deserted... You know, there's something
  wrong with the air here, Brian.
#+END_QUOTE

It's occuring to me that this may be the worst script I've ever actually
sat through reading. “This place smells wrong. Really badly wrong.”
Toomey threatens to sue the airline for $30 million for missing his 9AM
meeting before seeing flashbacks to his abusive father (John Griesemer,)
who mentions the Langoliers for the first time. The deserted airport
scene is the reason I've written this whole thing -- the dulled sounds
of the characters' heels on the tarmac, the putrefied air. The clocks
have stopped. The payphones are dead. The computers are lifeless. The
/abadonedness/ of it all. This is what the coronavirus has done to the
world and to Craig Toomey. Even the battery-powered devices are dead.
This is what confuses Stephen King Author Man to the point of
head-rubbing and cigarette smoking for the first time in ten years.

It's never actually explained what The Langoliers are. Ken Tucker for
/Entertainment Weekly/ describes them as
“[[https://ew.com/article/1995/05/12/tv-movie-review-langoliers/][little
meatballs]].” The little Beatles-haired girl can hear them approaching.
“It sounds a little like rice krispies after you pour the milk.” Foodism
abounds. “A really terrible, scary sound... Something making that
horrible cereal noise.” She screams that the cereal is going to kill
them. Somehow, Toomey finds a revolver while he's losing his mind.
Kimber Riddle the Stoner [[https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0725760/][went to

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  Don't forget, Craiggy-weggy, the langoliers were here. And they will
  be back.
#+END_QUOTE

Stephen King Author Man and Food Addict note that the food and soda have
gone completely flat. “Tastes like old tire,” says Don. “What we're
dealing with is time, not dimension,” says Stephen King. I'm wondering
what in the hell sort of room they're in at the moment, and who decided
those light wood countertops were /ever/ a good idea.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  The bottom line is, I believe, that we have hopped an absurdly short
  distance into the past, say as little as 15 minutes, and we're
  discovering the unlovely truth about time travel. That one can't
  appear in the Texas State School Book Depository on November 22nd,
  1963 and hope to stop the Kennedy assassination. One can't witness the
  building of the pyramids or the sack of Rome, or investigate the age
  of the dinosaurs firsthand. No, fellow time travellers, have a look
  around you. This is the past. It's empty. It's silent. It's a world
  with all the meaning of a discarded old paint can. Sensory input has
  disappeared. Electricity has already disappeared. And time itself is
  winding down in a kind of a spiral that's going faster and faster.
#+END_QUOTE

Little Prophet notes that the sound she's been hearing is once again
getting louder. Mr. Toomey's face is shoved in the floor, his nose bent.

** Why Extratone has used Discord instead of Slack for our team chat.
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: section0086.xhtml#why-extratone-has-used-discord-instead-of-slack-for-our-team-chat
   :END:

Back in 2015, I hosted a pre-/Extratone/ culture podcast called
[[https://open.spotify.com/episode/2zjkrB28csR68YoY1M1eSk][/Drycast/]]
with musician friends from all over the net. To record remotely, we
originally used Teamspeak 3 -- a gamer VoIP staple. When I discovered
Discord, I thought we'd found podcasting heaven. Originally, the free
plan included 128kbps audio in its voice channels, which was nearly
twice what we were getting out of our /paid/ Teamspeak server. If I were
still podcasting, Discord's
[[https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360041721052-Server-Video][just-released
server video feature]] would undoubtedly prove invaluable for live
streams.

[[https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/1261334179352100865]]

According to
[[https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/1261334179352100865?s=20][a poll I
ran on Twitter]], 2/3rds of all people on Earth are thankful for
Discord's existence. This is not surprising considering what every
Discord user is still offered without spending any money at all:
community spaces with audio/video and text chat capability, organizable
by Twitch and YouTube-integrated roles with a plethora of different
permission options, instantly and easily shareable by customizable
temporary or permanent invite links through an application that's about
as cross-platform as one can get (Windows, Mac, Linux, Android, iOS, or
simply one's web browser.) Those of us that remember
[[https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/1244758973867229185][IRC]],
Ventrilo, and Teamspeak should all consider Discord a tremendous gift.

Never before have so many VoIP, video, and text chat features been
offered together, or in such a beautiful package. “What we really did
was create an all-in-one voice, video, and text chat app that replaced
this constellation of tools that people would use,” said CEO Jason
Citron in [[https://youtu.be/NNJ2n6XKmmA][an interview with CNBC]].
Technically in terms of these details, Discord /has no competition/.
Slack offers text and voice chat with its paid plans, yes, but nothing
close in terms of video -- especially considering
[[https://www.polygon.com/2019/8/9/20798559/discord-go-live-private-stream-voice-channel][Discord
Go Live]], its fairly-new streaming feature, which allows users to
stream game video directly to 10 other users in the server. With some
jury-rigging, it's possible to simply screen share this way, which is an
essential sell for business video communication applications like Skype.

[[https://twitter.com/jab50yen/status/1270886743395520512]]

“Discord and Slack have many similarities, but Discord is the superior
tool,” says
[[https://medium.com/ardentunited/why-we-use-discord-and-not-slack-500ac8027824][esports
team Ardent United]]. “Discord has voice channels, which allows us to
easily chat with our supporters and other team members. Discord also
allows us to set user roles and permissions which makes moderation
extremely simple.” It's not just gaming companies, though. Decentralized
cloud platform Sia also

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  Its intended audience is gamers, but many large communities have
  switched from Slack to Discord, including development communities like
  [[https://facebook.github.io/react/blog/2015/10/19/reactiflux-is-moving-to-discord.html][Reactiflux]]
  and
  [[https://medium.com/@polymoon/unreal-slackers-is-moving-to-discord-c93492eb0612][Unreal
  Slackers]]. It includes an unlimited number of users, unlimited file
  uploads (with a per-file size limit), unlimited message histories, and
  really great moderation and spam filtering features.
#+END_QUOTE

Slack is [[https://www.pcmag.com/reviews/slack][often praised]] for its
integrations, but it shares support with
[[https://zapier.com/blog/slack-vs-discord/][Zapier]] -- a dedicated web
integration service which more or less integrates them equally.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  Slack works with [[https://slack.com/integrations][a long list of
  tools]], including Google Calendar, Zendesk, Salesforce, Wunderlist,
  and dozens of others. If you're looking for an integration that isn't
  immediately obvious, you can always turn to Zapier for help, because
  Slack is a supported service. Zapier is an online service that creates
  integrations between other apps and services, without you having to
  know any code to make it happen.
#+END_QUOTE

For sharing detailed post embeds, there's also
[[https://discohook.org/][Discohook]], which I just discovered.
Productivity company Chanty's blog wrote perhaps
[[https://www.chanty.com/blog/discord-vs-slack][the most in-depth
comparison]] of the two services (emphasis theirs):

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  At their core, Discord and Slack and very similar. Both are *team chat
  apps* with a similar interface. Both apps have *team communication
  organized* in channels. The biggest difference between the two is
  their *target audience*, and of course, their *specific features*.
#+END_QUOTE

Ultimately, one must decide how relevant the services' respective target
audiences are to productivity. For a not-for-profit media organization
like /Extratone/, Discord's features-for-price ratio is simply too rich
to pass up. If you'd like, [[https://discord.gg/0b9KQUKP858b0iZF][stop

** The ancient IP's MMO is still Online, albeit with some disappointing
discontinuations.

   :END:

I entertained fantasies about a /Star Trek/ MMO since first experiencing
the genre through /Eve Online/ and /World of Warcraft/ in early
adolescence. The idea of commanding my own starship in a universe of
other “captains” alongside a hand-picked bridge crew was a beguiling one
to myself and many others. This year, the game celebrated its
[[https://trekmovie.com/2020/01/29/star-trek-online-legacy-celebrate-10-years-of-sto-with-jeri-ryan-and-sonequa-martin-green/][ten-year
anniversary]] (aligning well with the
[[https://bilge.world/about][continued involuntary beat]] of this blog.)
I'm currently in the midst of my annual check-in with STO and thought an
exploration of this most-consequential video game of my life's history
would be an appropriate undertaking.

The execution of today's final, Arc Games-owned and maintained product
is a particularly long and interesting one. As
[[https://www.engadget.com/2014-11-22-the-game-archaeologist-perpetuals-star-trek-online.html][Justin
Olivetti chronicled for /Engadget/]], the license for /Star Trek Online/
was originally
[[https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/perpetual-entertainment-to-develop-and-publish-star-trek-massively-multiplayer-online-game][bought]]
and developed on by Perpetual Entertainment, which was assaulted by
[[https://web.archive.org/web/20150127173934/http:/massively.joystiq.com/2007/12/12/perpetual-plot-thickens-lawsuit-filed][a
lawsuit]] and extensive layoffs in December, 2006. The company was sued
by Kohnke Communications for allegedly selling “valuable assets like the
Star Trek Online license” to an affiliated entity called P2
entertainment. Clever. A quote from the complaint as
[[https://web.archive.org/web/20150128203353/http:/www.tentonhammer.com/node/15616][reported
by /Ten Ton Hammer/]]:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  “On information and belief, the assets transferred to P2 include
  Perpetual Entertainment trademarks and copyrights, the perpetual.com
  domain name, and assets related to Star Trek Online, including code
  and the license... Perpetual received less than market value for the
  assets it transferred to P2, and the transfer made Perpetual insolvent
  (or worsened Perpetual's existing insolvency).”
#+END_QUOTE

[[https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Star_Trek_Online_(Perpetual_Entertainment)][Perpertual's
STO]] was significantly different from today's MMO. Instead of
captaining one's own starship, “players would have taken on the role of
an officer who would be part of a crew of a starship,” echoing old
legacy titles like
[[https://www.ign.com/articles/2002/02/22/star-trek-bridge-commander-review][/Star
Trek: Bridge Commander/]].

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  The proposed solution was that players could own smaller ships like
  fighters and minor spaceships, but the big ones --- like the Galaxy
  class --- would instead be adventure hubs with explorable, detailed
  interiors.
#+END_QUOTE

[[file:xhtml/https:/i.snap.as/dswfpYb.jpg]]

I was 14 in 2008 when I joined the original post-Perpetual Entertainment
STO IRC channel when the game's license was
[[https://web.archive.org/web/20150203103236/http:/massively.joystiq.com/2008/01/14/star-trek-online-is-under-new-management/][first
transferred]] to Cryptic Studios. In fact, this channel was the only
reason I left IRC clients open on my computers for years. It was
exciting to find a community of people who were looking forward to
participating in a /Star Trek/ MMO as much as I was. I originally went
by the (very cringey) username “crazyhooligin,” under which my current
STO account is
[[https://ufplanets.com/member.php?13827-DavidBlue=][still registered]].
In the IRC channel, I met Sata -- host of the now-defunct

Junkies podcast]] and ex-Perpetual developer. He and the STORadio crew
accepted me into their Teamspeak conversations despite how strange and
unsocialized I was. I learned how
[[https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Star_Trek_Online_(Perpetual_Entertainment)][extensive]]
and
[[https://johneaves.wordpress.com/2009/06/25/more-vulcans-from-the-perpetual-files/][beautiful]]
their development had been. One wonders what Cryptic did with the
original game and art assets and who technically owns them now.

the rights]] to make the game in early-2008, Cryptic was legally
compelled to come up with a completed product in two years' time as
then-Executive Producer
[[https://sto.gamepedia.com/Stephen_D'Angelo][Stephen D'Angelo]]
explained on the [[https://youtu.be/a0tP0YrlJB0][100th episode of the

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  We were under a very massive deadline to deliver the game. We had
  acquired the license from Perpetual and Perpetual's license had an
  expiration date on it, and we had to ship the game before the
  expiration date or we would lose the license.
#+END_QUOTE

/STOked/ also provided an excellent historical account of the
acquisition entitled “[[https://youtu.be/Fhed2yKVYwY][How Cryptic Saved
Star Trek Online]].” By late-Fall, 2009, /Star Trek Online/
[[https://trekmovie.com/2009/10/22/star-trek-online-begins-closed-beta-trekmovie-giving-away-keys/][entered
Closed Beta]], which I somehow acquired a key for in the name of
[[https://web.archive.org/web/20100521081251/http:/www.stoholic.com/][STOHolic.com]]
(a blogger site which represents one of my first web projects ever.) I
was dual-booting Windows 7 Beta on my 2008 MacBook, which only supported
2 of its 4GB of RAM. The resulting performance was not optimal, but I
was tremendously excited just to participate. Somewhere, there are at
least three 480p handicam videos of Closed and Open Beta gameplay taken
from over my shoulder, but I could not find them at the time of this
writing. Comparatively, beta looked drastically different from the
property that's online today. In [[https://youtu.be/vH73ATZ96-w][this
video of the original entry tutorial]], we are introduced to the game's
basic controls by the voice of Zachary Quinto of J.J. Abrams fame as the
new Emergency Medical Hologram in godawful dropshadowed text. The
lighting is dated, the blue-based user interface even more so.

[[file:xhtml/https:/i.snap.as/t0aZwfB.jpg]]

The hair was bad and the textures of the armor, worse. So was mine,
though. I uploaded two videos under my STOholic name: an
[[https://youtu.be/pqGll-DZp6s][unboxing of the Collector's Edition]]
and what appears to be [[https://youtu.be/ghUJm9YWiVc][the definitive
YouTube tutorial]] to run /Star Trek Online/ on Mac OSX using the (now
defunct) wineskin wrapper. Though I was sixteen years old, I appear to
be about eight. Endless waves of ground enemies, pressing the “1” key
hundreds of thousands of times to whittle them away with my phaser
rifle. There were bugs on top of bugs. My favorite was a swap between
one's ground and space avatars: a gigantic captain would appear in space
and a little ship would appear on the ground.

Four years ago, Lead Developer Al Rivera wrote
“[[https://www.arcgames.com/en/games/star-trek-online/news/detail/10095363-history-of-star-trek-online-%E2%80%93-a-retrospective][History

chronology of the game from its February 2nd, 2010 release date -- about
a week after my 16th birthday, for which my mom bought me my first and
only gaming PC. I have never been very good at video games, and /Star
Trek Online/ has been no exception. After 10 years, my main Captain --
Ambassador Kuvak -- is still not doing adequate DPS to hold my own in
[[https://sto.gamepedia.com/Task_Force_Operation][Task Force
Operations]], from what I understand. My 15-16-year-old self chose a
Science Captain but wanted to fly the great (engineering/tank-focused)
cruisers of /The Original Series/, /The Next Generation/, and the
latter's movies. This is possible, but not necessarily advised.
Generally, one specs an Engineering Captain to tank, a Tactical Captain
for DPS, and a Science Captain for
“[[https://youtu.be/v5by0pRMNx8][exotic DPS]]” and light healing. I
managed to level a single science character -- the original -- through
to the max ranks using little intelligence and a lot of persistence.
Later in life, I've learned the patience for a more deliberate approach,
but still struggle to make the numbers.

Somna take]], and... that's about it. There was a definite (and entirely
reasonable) argument against the amount of combat across the community
early in the game's development, but it looks like the arguers have
simmered down and/or given up. This is also reasonable, considering its
now ten-year lifespan. The only trouble is that non-combat options in
/Star Trek Online/ have actually diminished over the years.

The original
[[https://sto.gamepedia.com/Exploration_Cluster][Exploration System]]
was an ingenious and significant idea that
“[[https://www.arcgames.com/en/games/star-trek-online/news/detail/6002963-exploration-cluster-removal][used
automated tools to facilitate large quantities of widely varied
content]].” Unfortunately, the result was “nothing close to what
[Cryptic] originally planned.” Instead of inspiring variety, Exploration
Clusters ended up becoming the most repetitive activity in the game --
nothing more than a good source of crafting materials. The missions were
generic and the environments simply randomly combined segments of the
same interior textures. Procedurally generated environments would hit
the mainstream conversation years later with
[[https://www.polygon.com/2016/8/12/12461520/no-mans-sky-review-ps4-playstation-4-pc-windows-hello-games-sony][/No
Man's Sky/]], which was written about in two fascinating articles by
Raffi Khatchadourian in
[[https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/18/world-without-end-raffi-khatchadourian][/The
New Yorker/]] and Chris Baker in
[[https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-news/no-mans-sky-how-games-are-building-themselves-104779/][/Rolling
Stone/]]:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  Using procedural generation isn't simply about offloading the creative
  process onto an algorithm -- the real challenge is that it requires
  developers to teach an algorithm the difference between good and bad
  game design.
#+END_QUOTE

Perhaps if /Star Trek Online/'s initial development window had not been
so limited, Cryptic would've had time and resources to pioneer something
truly /Trek/ and extraordinary in the exploration system, but it ended
up having to kill the idea altogether -- no amount of
[[https://www.change.org/p/cryptic-bring-exploration-to-star-trek-online-and-sto-back-to-the-true-roots-of-star-trek][Change.org
petitions]] could prevent this.

** The Foundry

   :CUSTOM_ID: section0087.xhtml#the-foundry
   :END:

Perhaps /the/ most innovative feature /Star Trek Online/ contributed to
gaming as a whole came to the live server in Spring, 2011. It was called
[[https://sto.gamepedia.com/The_Foundry][The Foundry]], and it allowed
players access to a diluted form of the same mission creation tools
Cryptic themselves used to create content, enabling the community to
publish its own playable stories. The result was a wonder virtually
inexpressible in words. In player-made Foundry Missions, I found joy,
wonder, sorrow, and insight -- truly everything and more than one could
ever want from fiction. Throughout 2013-2014 my girlfriend at the time
and I ran regular
[[https://sto.gamepedia.com/Foundry:List_of_missions][Foundry missions]]
together along with couple friends in our fleet. Unfortunately, I cannot
remember a single specific mission (aside from
[[https://youtu.be/zrXTZfHk4HQ][/Unholy Alliances/]], I think,) but I
remember the storytelling. I remember laughing at, dwelling on, and even
crying for the characters we were introduced to. There were
farming-oriented missions and some fairly rough drafts, sure, but the
vast majority of the content was deliberately and delicately considered,
especially the
[[https://www.arcgames.com/en/games/star-trek-online/news/detail/3027483][Foundry
Spotlight]] series, which highlighted player-created stories of a
particular quality and intrigue.

[[file:xhtml/https:/i.snap.as/CGCgrAb.jpg]]

Last April, however,
[[https://www.arcgames.com/en/games/star-trek-online/news/detail/11102923][Arc
retired the Foundry forever]] -- perhaps the worst possible news --
stating “the legacy knowledge required to maintain the Foundry at our
quality standards is no longer available,” meaning -- as
[[http://www.containsmoderateperil.com/blog/2019/3/4/cryptic-to-close-the-foundry][Rodger
Edwards notes]] -- that all developers with their hands, hearts, and
heads in the project had long since departed the company. The community
reaction was heartbreaking. On Reddit, a group of mission authors and
devotees
[[https://www.reddit.com/r/sto/comments/ayobu4/one_mans_quest_to_save_the_foundry/][committed
to capturing]] as many Foundry Missions as possible on video in the
month between the announcement and date of death. User
[[https://www.reddit.com/user/waimser/][waimser]] lamented the loss of
the Foundry as a critical hit to /Star Trek Online/'s endgame:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  Once you've played through the story missions and built your ship, the
  foundry is what's left, and it has some damn good stuff.
#+END_QUOTE

The group even created a Google Docs spreadsheet to coordinate the
effort. Another created
[[https://www.arcgames.com/en/forums/startrekonline#/discussion/1247628/keeping-up-with-the-foundry-after-the-foundry-general-psa-preserved-content][a
thread in the /Star Trek Online/ forums]] dedicated to “aggregating the
various channels with Foundry content and providing those links to you
and updating them as necessary.” In
[[https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2020-02-11-how-star-trek-online-managed-to-live-long-and-prosper][an
interview for /Gamesindustry.biz/]], Al Rivera suggested that the secret
to the title's longevity in which his team had been “strategically
successful” was knowing when and when not to make drastic changes.
“Don't change the fundamentals of what players love about your game,” he
suggested.

Though /STOked/ and /STORadio/ have long since been off the air, the
Roddenberry Podcast Network's /PriorityOne/ is still going strong,
having just recorded
[[https://priorityonepodcast.com/460-rebranding-kirk-casting-groupees-priority-one-a-roddenberry-star-trek-podcast/][its
460th episode]]. As I discovered last year, the game's Twitch community
is also thriving. [[https://www.twitch.tv/layriena][Layiena]]'s streams
are incredible because -- while he understands theory as well as the
other broadcasters in the STO Twitch community -- it's his incredible
skills at live Captain commentary (calling out abilities and other
command inputs as if he really is in the captain's chair.) It may sound
cringey (and perhaps it would be to many,) but his thoroughness and
accuracy actually 1) make it seem pretty darn cool to me and 2) are
hugely valuable in helping the viewer understand what he's doing. After
some three years, I know my one rotation fairly well, but only three or
four of its steps by name -- not even remotely well enough to do what he
does. Unfortunately, it appears as though he's been inactive since last
year.

[[https://www.twitch.tv/sphynx_sto][Sphynx]]'s streams also have an
especially professional feel -- he is excellent at calling out his
actions as well, if perhaps without so much intensity. His Norwegian
sensibility is wonderful: when I introduced myself as being around in
the community since 2008, he remarked “that's strange considering the
game has only been out since 2010.” Nigh-universally common threads
among them: imperturbable kindness to their audience and an impressively
wholesome commitment to /actually having fun/. Though I'm far from
deeply saturated with Twitch culture as a whole, I've watched my fair
share of /Eve Online/, /World of Warships/, and /Gran Turismo Sport/
streams, and -- while all of these have incredible communities --
there's none quite like the sincerity of the /Star Trek/ fraternity.

This past January, /Star Trek Online: Legacy/ was
[[https://www.arcgames.com/en/games/star-trek-online/news/detail/11357563-star-trek%3A-legacy-now-live!][launched]],
bringing /The Original Series/-referencing episodes /The Measure of
Morality/ parts
[[https://sto.gamepedia.com/Mission:_The_Measure_of_Morality_(Part_1)][/I/]]
and
[[https://sto.gamepedia.com/Mission:_The_Measure_of_Morality_(Part_2)][/II/]]
along with a new

[[https://www.arcgames.com/en/games/star-trek-online/news/detail/11351133-command-the-first-klingon%2Ffederation-ship!][Tier
6 Khitomer Alliance Battlecruiser]] -- “the first Klingon/Federation
Starship.” I did not participate in the event, save for experiencing the
new missions, which I talked about in
[[https://bilge.world/star-trek-discovery-review][my review of /Star
Trek: Discovery/]]. JustGaming4Us produced an excellent,
[[https://youtu.be/KHhakbz6q8s][in-depth video review]] of the two
missions as well as a [[https://youtu.be/M3KJkcCaymA][tour of the event
as a whole]]. I, for one, have never been partial to Shiny New Ship
gluttony largely because of how long it took me to “master” my own
Intrepid-Class Retrofit -- christened the U.S.S. /Bataan/ after the
aircraft carrier my grandfather served on in WWII -- as much as I have.
It took me years to arrange my bridge officer abilities and their
keybinds in such a way that I could maintain a fairly-steady dps
rotation and I have no desire to go through the process of learning a
new ship again. For most veteran players, however, trying out different
ships/skill specs is all there is left to do.

Choosing whether or not -- or to whom -- to recommend the game is an
issue best left to actual gaming journalists. In March, /Massively
Overpowered/ -- the followup project to what was once /Massively.com/ --
published
[[https://massivelyop.com/2020/03/30/mmo-cartographer-boldly-going-into-star-trek-online/][Mia

those who already love /Star Trek/:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  STO has some things going for it as a video game, and it's certainly
  unique in the MMO space, but it has too many basis quality issues for
  it to be a game I'd recommend to someone who's never watched an
  episode of Star Trek.
#+END_QUOTE

Compared to what I experienced all those years ago in Closed and Open
Beta, /Star Trek Online/ is now /vastly/ more polished, but perhaps
compared to other MMOs in 2020, it is, indeed, “rough.” In my casual
return this past month, I have yet to experience any significant bugs.
Considering his character data dates back to launch, I'd like to think
that the server is set into some brief, confused panic every time I log
in to Kuvak, but perhaps that's just a fantasy. I have still been
enjoying the space combat in the classic Advanced-level
[[https://www.arcgames.com/en/games/star-trek-online/news/detail/7003293-borg-disconnected][Borg
Disconnected]] and

TFOs and my first entry into high-level gear upgrade crafting from the
vast cache of materials I've built up over the years. . Apparently, my
old lockbox collection might actually be worth some significant Energy
Credits on the Exchange -- as of the time of this writing, however, not
a one had yet to sell.

If you're a ship junkie who's entirely unfamiliar with the property,
know that /Star Trek/'s ships are /fucking cute/. The
[[https://www.startrek.com/article/inside-the-nebula-class-starship][Nebula
Class]], especially, inspires real affection. In my opinion, it alone is
worth giving this free-to-play game a shot. My two point eight pound
[[https://extratone.com/microsoft-surface-laptop-2-review-windows-future][Surface
Laptop 2]] is enough to run it fairly well at medium-high settings,
which is an absurdly low barrier-to-entry. You shouldn't be worried
about investing your time, either -- /Star Trek/ doesn't appear to be
dying anytime soon.

/Listen to the entirety of the chapter read aloud by Siri Voice 2
below./

In the right hour, the woodland springtime metamorphic processes of the
neighboring Lake Geneva suburb's in-betweens were in a paused state --
the toads again hushed; the crickets tired, and the human populace, too.
In the right hour, the fickle wind and the social owls were the only
sound, and nothing moved but the sparse, light-footed doe in careful
segments with her fawn. From the main gated lane of /The Nice, Huge
Estate/, Lenny Lather slid through the muddy barrier and started
bouncing West on the blacktop, brogues squeaking every third step. The
overcasted clouds were having trouble deciding whether or not to let
down their rain -- as they had been all day -- and the old, heavy
early-March mist softened the yellow glow of the tall, buzzing
streetlamps so much that he couldn't help but intermittently wipe his
eyes, for the spreading light convinced his mind that his eyelashes
must've been wetted.

Theodore Pith's big old house was now burrowed between two mismatched
neighborhoods -- the bleaker Easterly, which was too new for its alien
trees to have recovered from the brutality of its development's
clear-cutting and contained within one of its central featureless
backyards an unidentifiable creature which made all through the night
the most unimaginably ghastly, disturbingly human child-like shrieking;
the opposing Westerly's trees further enough along in their regrowth --
ten or twenty years perhaps -- to appear more of the planet Earth to
Manhattan-bred Lenny Lather, who still found the colorless destruction
of suburbia unendingly upsetting, especially when coming down. In the
interest of his regular withdrawal's mitigation, he had already
established two short, repeatable tracks and a longer, several mile-long
loop which skirted him sufficiently around the East's center to avoid
hearing the shrieks in all but the stillest nights. Never in his years
-- on these walks he was /especially/ reminded of just how many there
were -- had he been able to feel such absolute ownership of his
surroundings. The eroding Earth slipping away from the hem of the
warped, stained wood fences; the sidewalks, cracked, bent, sloped
helter-skelter, often muddied in the troughs and joints -- generally
laying haphazardly in layers after having been steadily tossed about by
the glacial forces of their intermixture with clay, precipitation, and
the tumultuous temperature-dependent torture of the two -- these were
his, entirely, in the right hour. Between two and five in the morning
when the earliest risers would blearily revive their dewy automobiles
from long, silent hibernation, the whole world -- everything in his
sight and more at any moment -- it was all /his/, without a single
worthy challenger.

In the right hour, the roads were completely and totally abandoned --
for the New Yorker, an unfathomable absolute -- and all humanity was at
rest. In the right hour, Lenny Lather was the appointed guardian of the
worn domesticity of a small nation, though the lonely occupation was
astoundingly lax, for in the miles and miles of empty streets he had
already traversed in his nightly holidays from the World of Pith, he had
yet to encounter a single unexpected factor or minutely threatening
presence. Since shortly after his December arrival, he'd walked through
even the most frigid mornings. Of course, the stillness had then been
/even more/ otherworldly, and Lenny was curious to see how his new most
private domain would change with the seasons. Though the auxiliary guest
room which he now called home was no smaller or less hospitable than the
master bedroom of his late Hudson Yards flat shared with his late Wife,
it proved to be a poor respite from Theodore Pith, who treated him --
when they were “home” at /Nice, Huge/ -- as the puppy he never had, and
expected his participation to remain entirely vulnerable to his any
whim. Granted -- in their shared abuse of amphetamines, cocaine, and
assorted other stimulants -- Lenny Lather was vastly more prepared for
the games than any circadian guest could've possibly been. At first, the
ten-foot door of his dawn-facing room had closed without latching, but
with the warmth and moisture brought with the Midwestern Spring, the
most secure state in which the engorged wood could be forcibly arranged
still left a half-inch crack, and Lather's last chance of privacy was
lost.

The latest favorite pastime of /Nice, Big/'s Master necessitated a
willing, capable driver, and -- as keeping a single Butler (much less an
entire household staff) was proving extremely difficult for him -- Lenny
Lather was the sole pick of the draft. In the earliest hours of one
Tuesday morning in February, he'd been pleasantly dosing and drooling on
his laptop after an evening of obsessive, incoherent notetaking when the
huge door had been kicked ajar by a deep black, blindingly shiny oxford
with excessively violent force. Attached to the shoe in an equally
blinding penguin tuxedo, towering bowler hat, and cartoonish fake
mustache was the Great, Blown Pith.

“Hope you're not busy,” he'd said quite loudly to the lolling Lather,
leaning and tilting his head into the lamp light, which had dislodged
his monocle and briefly occupied him with untangling its chain.

...

“You're not /busy/, are ya?!” he'd shouted, tapping the shiny brass
lion's head of his shiny black cane against the vanity... then swatting
it with a flicking wrist... then clubbing it with a full, two-handed
homerun swing -- taking huge, vaguely cat nose-shaped gouges from the
surface of the wood. The splintery wood chips had rained down upon the
hunched Lenny; he'd stirred with one found its way in his open mouth --
he'd chewed it slowly and swallowed it, but he still had not awoken.
Nevertheless, Theodore Pith's coked-up enthusiasm couldn't possibly have
yielded to common decencies like his guest's nighttime peace.

...

“SHOOT, LENNY,” he'd screamed in his companion's ear, having traversed
the room to his bedside.

“I SURE HOPE YOU'RE NOT BUSY RIGHT NOW!”

...

Finally, he'd resorted to tickling Lenny's nose with the ornament, which
had reeked with the urinal smell of metal polish -- the sudden,
overwhelming delivery of which to the writer's olfactory nerves finally
causing ample alarm in his nervous system to justify bringing him
abruptly back to his life and deluded host.

“I need a favor. The Duesie's warming up. We're going for a ride.”

Unable to form a linguistic response, Lenny Lather had obeyed Theo's
frenzied, repeating instructions and stumbled into the matching suit
he'd brought over his arm -- wondering with marginal, arrested clarity
at how well-tailored it was for him. He had not the soundness of
perception to protest when Pith had whipped a deep black, blindingly
shiny bowtie around his already-congested esophagus, nor when he'd
adheased the huge, itchy matching fake moustache to his upper lip and
nearly pulled the matching Tower of Bowler all the way down over his
ears. He had been unresponsive when he'd been sat on the bench under the
agonizing fluorescent lights of the laundry room, affixed with deep
black, blindingly shiny matching oxfords, and asked if he smoked and how
well he could say /guffaw./

...

“Just wait... you have no idea... you have no idea how much fun this is
going to be.”

Lenny Lather had not... /could not/ have made a sound through the
confusing nonsense of his waking pre-Great Depression dream, but when
the old servant's door had been opened before him and set the heartless,
single-digit Winter wind upon his very soul, he had all at once arrived
in the world, laughing and whooping together with Theodore Pith.

“Jesus /Christ!/” he'd screamed as they'd hobbled to the stable, where a
devilishly dark red Model J Duesenberg had sat shivering in a rough
idle, staring out the retrofitted garage door with its basketball-sized
lights as if it was, indeed, a flesh-and-blood steed that had just been
frightened awake by a thunderstorm, but the sky had been as clear as it
would've been from an asteroid -- as it is only on the coldest nights --
and almost comically dominated by the setting, gluttonously luminescent
moon. Theodore had then grabbed a screwdriver from the workbench and
bent down to remove the license plate -- which had said /BLOOD/ in big
black bold block letters -- and its containing frame. By the time he had
settled into the frigid red leather of the exposed, roofless driver's
seat, Lenny Lather was full-to-bursting with adrenaline and laughing out
huge streams of breathy steam. From behind him in the cabin, Pith had
been /guffawing/ plumes, too, as he'd briefly ignited his
cocaine-sprinkled mustache instead of the bratwurst-sized cigar between
his teeth. The smell of burning human hair had accented his explanation
of the old car's transmission and its direct path from source-to-nose
for Pith had required a brief, unplanned intermission as it induced
without warning his violent heaving -- still part-/guffawing/ -- hanging
half out of his beautifully-upholstered suicide door.

As he had spewed -- expertly sparing the swoop of the gleaming waxy
fender -- Lenny had found a pair of deep black, blindingly shiny gloves
and -- after less grinding than you would imagine, to his credit --
first gear, setting the whole dastardly circus in motion.

“Where to, Sire?” Lenny had asked, nose lifted to an untenable altitude
in a pitiful approximation of an accent that'd never actually been used
before by any person or persons in all of history, struggling for
breath.

“Left at the gates, Barnsward, old chap,” Theodore had replied in a
contrasting fashion after again sitting upright from his heaves and
taking a breath, ironing out -- if anything -- the flatness of his
perforating Ohio Ds and Ps, resulting in such a culturally destructive
racket that it had set both of them in uncontrollable, cloudy fits
lasting long after Lather had swerved the great length of the car from
the gravel to his abandoned asphalt retreat. The two had continued their
banter down that soul-suckingly flat vector, one-upping each other's
etymologic barbarity against the savage thievery of the heatless wind.

“Now to star-board, Budleigh, my good fellow!”

...

“Right-o, as you say, sir!”

...

“Down to the /pu-hb/ for a /spaht/ of /brahn/-dee with me /mae-its/!”

...

“/Oncemo-ar/ right, pip pip!”

...

“By /jah-lee/, there we are!”

...

After the entirety of Northern European history had been decimated and
subsequently forgotten, the Duesenberg named /BLOOD/ had turned its
orange, googley-eyed stare and narrow whitewalled hooves up the
reflective, freshly-painted access of the new 24-hour grocery in the
no-man's-land between the cookie-cutter stares of the neatly-rowed
Easterly neighborhood and the droning respiration of Interstate 43, two
miles distant. It was 2:12 in the morning and most of the greasy-haired
night stocking shift had been halfway through their third smoke break,
circled around a store-used picnic table 50 yards from the far sliding
airlock doors. The first to spot /BLOOD/ had been the second shortest of
the lot, whose weary scrutiny along the truest radian to the West from
under his sweaty beanie in her entrance she had crossed, and the depth
of her red as he first spied it had caused him vertigo -- as if he would
fall in -- and cast upon the shorter-than-average length of his being an
all-consuming existential doubt. The tallest and loudest of them had
faced squarest the white faux-brick wall of the box building and was at
that moment engaged upon a spirited rant about where and where'nt and
when a vapist ought to buy his Suck juice between long, gasping Sucks
from his super-shiny Suck box. Of course, the arrival of a customer even
at such a late hour did not warrant notice at a huge, broadly-servicing
operation like theirs, but as /BLOOD/ had crept through all four
reflective yellow-checkered pedestrian crossings, closing without a
flinch, and the details of her occupying caricatures had become more and
more numerous, she had stolen the attention of the huddle, one-by-one,
and elicited from each the rarest under-breath profanity of true,
unmolested wonder.

“/Jesus Christ/,” had said the shortest.

“/Holy fuck,/” had said the youngest.

“/Gee whiz/,” had said the oldest.

And the Sucking tallest, having realized he'd lost his audience, had
been the last to turn and follow their eyes /BLOOD/'s way as she had
halted coolly in front of the purely white glowing concrete leading into
the closest customer entrance, and had -- without the gradual exposure
over the length of her approach that his peers had been afforded --
dropped his Suck box and exclaimed at the sudden, undiluted immensity of
the spectacle, simply, “/FUCK!/”

The Sucking's /FUCK/ and the splitting shatter of his Suck against the
glass of their smoking table had reached the two arrivees -- albeit in a
muted way -- and through the onset of their frostbite's early stages
even further stoked their already-uncontrollable boyish giggling.
Theodore Pith had paused briefly to affix his monocle as firmly as
possible in his eye socket and stuff down his spasmic /guffaws/ with a
few lip-smacking puffs of his then successfully-lit cigar before
swinging his right door open.

“Stay here and wait at the ready, my good... my /best/ Bagsy! I shan't
be a twinkle,” he had declared, clicking it lightly shut again and
turning on his heels toward the pale light of the store, twirling his
cane in dramatically shortened strides so as to reproduce the oversped
effect of a silent motion picture, puff-puffing away. As the doors had
sensed him and indiscriminately whirred aside, he had turned to the
smokers -- most of whom had still been reeling, grabbing for their hair
-- and bobbed the bulk of his big black bowler toward their communion
with his gloved black fingers by the brim.

“Tally-/ho/, my boys!” he had shouted, sending Lenny Lather's wide open
face toward the floor of the idling car as he doubled over himself in
the first spontaneously asphyxiating, tear-lobbing laughter he'd yet to
experience in the 21st century. As Theodore had entered the masterpiece
of the boxed store's bleakness in his cane twirling, head swinging,
cigar puffing shuffle, he had made sure to stay his instinct to /sneak/
for a swift, full-chat /dart/, instead, and the on-duty leather-faced
embodiment of tedium's wrath beneath his lone lit lane light had looked
up from his /People/ Magazine just in time to see the heel of a deeply
black oxford and the last shiny inches of flowing black coattails
disappear behind the potato sack endcap of the far Aisle 1. He'd
hesitated, chin against palm, holding his next glossed page
perpendicularly erect between his tightened thumb and index finger for a
long few seconds of fantastic stillness -- had hastily attempted a
diagnostic of his present senses -- before a locomotive-like segmented
tube of cigar smoke had risen from against the light tiles and unsoiled
trimming to intersect his line-of-sight where it met the darkened deli,
recessed in the far wall from his hunch, the motion startling him into
his own throat-clearing, counter-rounding, key-jingling, /excuse
me/-shouting march toward the lumpy potato sacks and the climbing
dissipation of the most unbelievable violation. As he had jingled, he
had reflected on the few occasions in which he'd ever smelled tobacco
smoke in /his/ store: all incidental, most very brief, and many followed
by a lengthy, unreasonably self-deprecating apology. To just walk in his
Temple of Domestic Fulfilment during this most Serene Time of Silent
Service, spewing orange nicotine on his premium, Food & Drug
Administration-blessed body and blood offering to the middle class was
surely in ignorance, but could have even been /in spite/. Regardless,
the transgression was worthy of the most merciless wrath, and he had
been selected as its willing, capable vessel. In just the fifteen
seconds it'd taken him to jingle his way to Aisle 1, he'd thought
himself and his leather into flash-broiling, fast-rising fury.

Perhaps the least expected sight that could have possibly greeted this
Apostle of Appraisal on the far side of Aisle 1 -- as he rounded the
potato sack endcap and filled his /excuse me/ lungs in preparation
through his nose -- was the labored lifting of the 125-pound eldest
child of the new, Parisian-trained, full-time, certified cheese artisan
-- whom the store had just won out of 175 competitors in a region-wide
raffle of her pilot program -- by the dashing, swinging, and smoking
real-life manifestation of a young Rich Uncle Pennybags, yet shock did
not long halt the Keys & Leather.

“Sir! Excuse me!”

...

“/Excuse me!/ Sir!”

...

Theodore Pith -- having reevaluated the girth of his intended booty --
had propped his shiny black cane against the sill of the refrigerator
and popped each slack bottom up off his oxfords from his shins before
squatting over the massive Holy Wheel of the Artisan where it lay
displayed on a sturdy bespoke plinth.

...

“Sir! You need to put out that cigar... the cigar -- put it out
immediately!”

Keys & Leather had the odd inability to both shout and shuffle at the
same time, so he'd only made it to the pomegranate juice by the time
Pith had mustered enough momentum to swing the cheese child into a high
enough pendulum to carry it stably facing forward under his chin with
his two hands spaced evenly on the Great Wheel's bottom.

...

“Sir! I'm going to have to ask you to put that down... That is a four
thousand dollar item... If you want to buy it, we need to go about-”

“...now, see here!” Pith had replied with great effort, in the midst of
weighing in his mind the worth of the cane as a casualty, then of the
monocle, too, which had fallen out while he was weighing, and of his own
physical intelligence, and whether or not it was capable of retrieving
the cane by its brass lion's head handle via the top of a flicking foot
without losing his balance. Keys & Leather, meanwhile, had been tortured
at great length witnessing -- in Theodore's gravitational struggle --
the Cuban's ashes knocked all over the precious round Immanuel; the
artisan's Beloved, Chosen son of cheese -- a nauseating sensation of
loss overwhelming all hope of his store's defense. The Terrible Theodore
had at once noticed his hesitation /and/ arrived upon a plan to leave no
prop behind. He had leaned forward with the girth of the wheel and
closed the remaining few feet between them, advancing with the huge mass
of Nazarethian dairy to bear it all down upon the unsuspecting Leather,
who in his grief for the prized wheel was far too slow to deflect its
incoming mass.

“Now, see here, chum!” Pith had forced from the furthest possible
extremis of his best mob mouth as he transferred his burden all at once
to its most concerned party, who collapsed against the multilayered
tables that made up the fresh cookie display, with the weight of the
wheel on his belly. As the stunned Leather struggled to separate himself
without further soiling the only item in his store that sold for double
a month's paycheck, Theodore had replaced his monocle and returned for
his cane in a single stride, which he'd then used after a return step to
the pile of chocolate chip, almond nut, and fuming night manager to rap
loose with the snout of the terrible brass cat Leather's white
knuckle-tight grip on the wheel with a lampoonish /haha!/ before rolling
the freed cheese toward the door in a villainous cackle.

“Man, /come on/,” the defeated Leather had yelled halfheartedly from his
pile of sweets, struggling against the awkward, slippery boxes for
enough footing to stand. His efforts, though, were interrupted after a
time by the abrupt mute of Pith's cackling in the second swooshing of
the front sliding doors -- he had missed his last chance of pursuit. It
had all been in vain -- he'd failed to guard the crown jewel of the
whole suburb. As he had given up the chase and the cheese and slumped
once more against the ruined pile, the ridiculousness of the crime
against him nearly cracked a smile, but soon was deterred by the very
real thought of explaining what had happened to his General Manager when
she arrived in just five hours. After a moment, there, covered in
cookies, dust, ashes, and shame, he had quietly begun to sob.

After he had regained control of his diaphragm, Lenny Lather had been
amused, outside, by the varying velocities in which the smokers of the
night shift gave in to their curiosities about the presence of the
seven-figure collectible and its purpose in waiting at its now healthier
idle in front of their grocery store in the loneliest time of a Tuesday
morning. The first and the bravest had been the one who first spotted
their intrusion -- the shortest -- if only because he had remained
entirely convinced for the duration that /BLOOD/ and its two,
period-dressed occupants were nothing but an apparition of his dead
Grandfather and Great Uncle like others he'd thought he'd seen before,
and -- though he'd been terrified by the clarity of this realest visit
yet, he'd been irritated more than anything, and wanted to know “why the
hell can't you just leave me /alone/?!” The others behind him had been
staggered in the proximity to the waiting car they had achieved -- the
lesser and most cowardly being the largest -- the Sucking evangelist --
who had been waiting for the great automobile to leave so he could forge
the exchange of his broken Suck box for a new one from the back. In the
delirium of his exhaustion and progressing frostbite, Lenny Lather had
thought the image of the men where they were would make for an
interesting, organic graph on the nature of courage -- their positions
simply representing their unaltered datapoints, and had been considering
how best to deal with or respond to the nearer, deluded one, who had by
then come close enough to the elegant, professionally polished
front-right fender to reach out and touch it with his unwashed hands,
and appeared to be taking the matter under serious consideration. He'd
been seconds away from finally deciding between his idiotic ideas for a
joke response when by far the largest wheel of cheese he'd ever seen had
come rolling out of the opening doors onto the concrete, followed
closely behind by Theodore Pith who'd still had three-quarters or more
of his cigar left to smoke and apparently switched to cheap mob clichés
in his brief absence.

“Haste, Don Lenny!” he'd yelled, re-opening his closest cabin door to
chuck his cane in first. He'd then straddled the great wheel to position
it against the step before making a scene of grunting and huffing
against its side with his full weight. Again, the bewildered smokers had
fallen silent -- they did not recognize the ridiculous delicacy because
it was special inventory and could only be handled by the Holy Artisan
herself. Lather had started revving the huge old straight-8 to answer
Pith's urgency, who had found himself fresh out of phrases after the
wheel had finally succumbed to its capture and rolled into the footwell.

“Make haste, make haste, my boy!” he'd shouted, diving theatrically into
the covered back seat, head-first, to which his icing chauffer had
responded by revving the behemoth and briskly popping her clutch, which
had lurched the pair into the last, getaway stage of their late grocery
heist. As /BLOOD/'s razor-edged hood ornament had sliced through the
night by the dumbstruck smokers, Theodore Pith was unable to think of
anything to shout at them as he passed but for “bada-bing, bada-/BOOM!/”

Though the Lake Geneva Police Department was shown the security footage
of that first theft by management, the theatricality of their matching
getup had inadvertently obscured their identities, and the
organization's extreme deficit of imagination had left them stumped by
the lack of license plates on the car, despite the free and effortless
ability of just about any casual enthusiast of early American luxury
automobiles and/or lackadaisical disciple of the Concours religion to
immediately identify /BLOOD/ by /name/ from the grainiest image, if
consulted. If anything, their incompetence rewarded Pith and Lather's
continued focus on the products of the same store's cheese artisan, as
intelligence on the state of her latest flagship incubation was freely
available with no more effort than it took to simply stop by her display
amid regular shopping trips. Twice in two weeks, they stole both of her
replacements for the biggest child without any significant alternation
of their method, which frustrated her and the management nearly to the
point of crises, and quickly lost all potential for fun in a third
attempt -- their kicks were in their absurdity, not their
/effectiveness/, and neither of them cared much for the cheese.

Almost exactly two years ago,
[[https://bilge.world/google-soul-ledger-dont-be-evil][I warned that
Google was on track to replace God]] of us all. Last month, /The
Verge/'s Dieter Bohn reported that
[[https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/28/21272543/google-search-results-page-experience-load-time-contentfu-paint-layout-shift-top-stories-amp][Google
plans to begin accounting for “page experience” in its search rankings]]
beginning in 2021, later explaining in a
[[https://www.theverge.com/21274502/vergecast-podcast-407-trump-executive-order-social-media-hbo-max-launch][subsequent
episode of /The Vergecast/]]:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  Here is another example of the Chrome team coming up with a bunch of
  web standards and then the Search team making a bunch of incentives
  based on those standards.
#+END_QUOTE

It was news to me that in May, Google
[[https://blog.chromium.org/2020/05/introducing-web-vitals-essential-metrics.html][launched]]
a page called “Web Vitals” on its [[https://web.dev/vitals/][*web.dev*]]
domain (which they've
[[http://web.archive.org/web/20180415000000*/web.dev][apparently owned
since November 2018]].) The company measures “page experience” based on
three main criteria:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE

  - [[https://web.dev/lcp/][*Largest Contentful Paint*]] measures
    perceived load speed and marks the point in the page load timeline
    when the page's main content has likely loaded.
  - [[https://web.dev/fid/][*First Input Delay*]] measures
    responsiveness and quantifies the experience users feel when trying
    to first interact with the page.
  - [[https://web.dev/cls/][*Cumulative Layout Shift*]] measures visual
    stability and quantifies the amount of unexpected layout shift of
    visible page content.
#+END_QUOTE

[[https://www.costarastrology.com/neoyokel][CoStar]] just sent an oddly
topical (and honestly, encouraging) notification:

[[file:xhtml/https:/i.snap.as/1Lo8JrN.jpeg]]

I'm not a “real” web developer -- nor do I mean to dictate to a single
one -- but I know enough theory to note that of this “core web”
education operation centered around web.dev is operating on some
irritating assumptions:

*** 1. Smaller assets are ideal.
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: section0090.xhtml#1-smaller-assets-are-ideal
    :END:

The simple assumption that it is always better to have the smallest page
possible -- that images should be resized and compressed to hell and
typography/other elements should be few in number. Instantaneous page
loads should be priority over any other standards of measure for a web
page -- like interesting design, for instance.

*** 2. Minimalistic design is necessary.
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: section0090.xhtml#2-minimalistic-design-is-necessary
    :END:

The reality -- for most of the Western world, at least -- is that
[[https://www.forbes.com/sites/kevinmurnane/2018/12/11/heres-how-internet-speeds-fared-for-the-worlds-fastest-and-largest-countries-in-2018/#3f3124664976][average
network speeds are exponentially increasing]] year-by-year. In 2018:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  World-wide average mobile download speed was 22.82 Mbps (Megabits per
  second), an increase of 15.2% over 2017. Average upload speed was 9.19
  Mbps, an increase of 11.6%. Fixed broadband speeds also increased.
  Average download speed increased 26.4% to 46.12 Mbps, while average
  upload speed came in at 22.44 Mbps, a 26.5% increase.
#+END_QUOTE

I may be a yokel, but these averages are still absolutely
/inconceivable/ to me. Our phones have as much RAM as my “studio” work
desktop, now. 22.82 Mbps will reliably download /very/ complex web pages
nearly instantaneously. There is a very reasonable argument for
essential services like search engines and news websites to conform
to/adopt standards like AMP, but for the rest of The Open Web, ingenuity
and risktaking should be /encouraged/, not discouraged, for the true
good of all Peoplekind.

A term I haven't seen for a good while describes this ideology: “the
*mobile web*,” and it completely sucking ass is not a new concept. I've
before referenced
[[https://www.theverge.com/2015/7/20/9002721/the-mobile-web-sucks][an
old complaint]] from 2015 by /The Verge/'s Editor-in-Chief, Nilay Patel
(which the original article also links in different context in its last
line):

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  The entire point of the web was to democratize and simplify publishing
  using standards that anyone could build on, and it has been a raging,
  massively disruptive success for decades now. But the iPhone's
  depressing combination of
  [[https://www.netmarketshare.com/browser-market-share.aspx?qpcustomd=1&qprid=0][dominant
  mobile web marketshare]] and shitbox performance means we're all sort
  of ready to throw that progress away.
#+END_QUOTE

*** 3. Google has the right to dictate “Best Practices.”
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: section0090.xhtml#3-google-has-the-right-to-dictate-best-practices
    :END:

The Mobile Web as a utility has its place, but it's certainly not a
necessary or desirable ideal for the entirety of The Web, yet Google has
the audacity to presume it can dictate what is and is not optimal web
design. The URL in and of itself is extremely presumptuous -- Google
technically has every right to own web.dev, sure, but /should/ it? The
Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMP) program has already had an annoying
effect on day-to-day browsing. I despise AMP links more than most things
in life, just as I despise the name of the website /Search Engine Land/
(which sounds like actual hell) who
[[https://searchengineland.com/the-google-page-experience-update-user-experience-to-become-a-google-ranking-factor-335252][also
reported on this]]:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  If you have AMP, the good news is that the majority of AMP pages do
  extremely well in terms of page experience metrics, [Google Project
  Manager] Rudy Galfi said. It doesn't mean that all AMP pages will have
  top page experience metrics, but AMP is built in a way to help with
  this.
#+END_QUOTE

Recently, I discovered an incredibly refreshing/affirming essay wrapped
in a hand-build web experience called
“[[https://neustadt.fr/essays/the-small-web/][Rediscovering the Small
Web]]” by designer [[https://twitter.com/parimalsatyal][Parimal
Satyal]], arguing for a different variety of Web presence:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  Modern web design principles are very rarely directed at regular
  people looking to make a website on something they are interested in.
  Instead, the focus is on creating websites that perform well: /Don't
  use too many colours. Write short, catchy headlines. Don't let content
  be too long. Optimise for SEO. Produce video content, attention span
  is decreasing. Have a an obvious call to action. Push your newsletter.
  Keep important information above the fold. Don't make users think.
  Follow conventions./
#+END_QUOTE

I realize that the majority of Web utilization cannot “revert” to
hand-coded plain HTML web pages hosted on Neocities, but there's
something to be learned (or remembered, in my case) from Satyal's
argument: *The Web's forgotten strength is diversity* (much like my
country's, it would seem,) and the majority of users are being pushed by
Google's search engine toward a very specific minority of URLs. We have
not been /exploring/ for a very long time:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  Instead of browsing, the web is for many an endless and often
  overwhelming stream of content and commentary picked out by algorithms
  based on what they think you already like and will engage with. It's
  the opposite of exploration.
#+END_QUOTE

“It is worth remembering a website does not have to be a product; it can
also be art,” argues Satyal. “The web is also a creative and cultural
space that *need not confine itself to the conventions defined by
commercial product design and marketing*.” (Emphasis mine.) It's not
just that The Web was /meant/ to be more -- nostalgia is definitely not
my particular trip, if you didn't know -- it's that it /can/ be so much
more. My [[https://bilge.world/open][list of favorite Open Web
projects]] contains just a few examples of what I mean.

It's possible I am being /too/ critical of Google. A
[[https://twitter.com/search?f=live&q=%22https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2020%2F5%2F28%2F21272543%2Fgoogle-search-results-page-experience-load-time-contentfu-paint-layout-shift-top-stories-amp%22][Twitter
search]] for the link to /The Verge/'s article reveals commentary like
“[[https://twitter.com/carlosriverao/status/1266051773472608257][Experience,
matters ;)]],”
“[[https://twitter.com/markupgrade/status/1266492831218139137][Web
search moving forward]],” and
“[[https://twitter.com/reDDakteur/status/1266078587767177219][Halleluja!]],”
so there are clearly users who are more than onboard, and not all of
what Google has done for the web recently has been detrimental. It was
also announced last month that
[[https://blog.chromium.org/2020/05/resource-heavy-ads-in-chrome.html][Chrome
will begin blocking “resource-heavy” advertisements]] by default and
that
[[https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/28/21273934/microsoft-google-chrome-edge-chromium-spellcheck-improvements][Google
and Microsoft have been working together to improve spellcheck and
scrolling in Chromium]]. There's not much to feel about these
announcements, but -- as always -- there is a whole lot to feel about
Google as a company.

Google has
[[https://dev.to/chromiumdev/announcing-web-dev-live-a-three-day-digital-event-2640][announced]]
a three-day live digital event at the end of this month (June 30th-July
2nd) in which viewers will “celebrate our community's actions, learn
modern web techniques and connect with each other.” “Over three days,
we'll share quick tips on aspects of modern web development,” explains
the company on its [[https://web.dev/live/][web.dev/live page]]. I am
planning to attend and bitch as much as I am allowed.

Something always worth celebrating: a considered, no-nonsense new effort
to reimagine email. I've lived through many notable milestones in this
regard: [[https://youtu.be/vN4U5FqrOdQ?t=2321][Apple Mail]] on the
original iPhone,
[[https://time.com/43263/gmail-10th-anniversary/][Gmail]], Readdle's
[[https://www.theverge.com/2015/5/29/8683775/spark-email-app-iphone-apple-watch][Spark]],
and (yes, really,) the revitalization of
[[https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/4/17819636/microsoft-resdesigned-outlook-windows-web][Microsoft's
Outlook]]. Exciting innovations have abounded throughout email's
history, but it's highly debatable whether or not any of them have
really changed the way we use it in a profound way, yet I am unfailingly
intrigued whenever somebody new comes along, so when I saw
[[https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/15/21286466/hey-email-basecamp-price-availability-platforms-launch][Casey
Newton's story]] on /The Verge/'s frontpage discussing Basecamp's
[[https://hey.com/][HEY]] before I got out of bed on the morning of June
15th, I was delighted to see an organization still had the courage to
invest their confidence and resources into their Ideas About Email.
Originally,
[[http://web.archive.org/web/20200510220647/https://hey.com/][HEY's
homepage]] included a prompt: “To get on the list, email iwant@hey.com
and tell us how you feel about email. Could be a love story, or a hate
story. Could be long, could be short. It's your story, so it's up to
you.” Though I knew it'd likely never be read, I decided to write them a
letter about my personal history with email, which turned into an
entertaining enough anecdote to publish here.

The real reason HEY continued to be so widely covered by tech media,
though, was its challenge to Apple's App Store policies after one of its
updates was
[[https://www.protocol.com/hey-email-app-store-rejection][rejected by
the marketplace]] just a day after Casey's story was published. Much
drama ensued -- I have done my best to aggregate links to all the news
stories on the subject in
[[https://www.reddit.com/r/extratown/comments/hbncn6/news_surrounding_hey_the_upcoming_email_service/][a
thread]] on the [[https://www.reddit.com/r/extratown][/Extratone/
subreddit]] I recently started. I think
[[https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/16/21293419/hey-apple-rejection-ios-app-store-dhh-gangsters-antitrust][the
public resistance by Basecamp's CTO David Heinemeier Hansson]] was
probably a PR move, which is fine, but all I wanted to contribute was a
review of the actual function of HEY, itself. After reading posts by
some of my favorite bloggers, however, I think it would be redundant.
Kev Quirk argued “[[https://kevq.uk/email-is-not-broken/][Email Is Not
Broken]],” to which Mike Stone responded
“[[https://mikestone.me/email-is-broken][Email Is Broken]].”
Additionally, /Business Insider/'s Lisa Eadicicco published an
[[https://www.businessinsider.com/hey-email-app-review-basecamp-inbox-2020-7][in-depth

My singular commentary: I'm worried that subscription services that
exclusively accept large yearly sums like HEY inevitably become the
“country club for the most self-important emailers in business” which
Casey spoke of. I guess we'll see.

** Email and I: An Abridged History
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: section0091.xhtml#email-and-i-an-abridged-history
   :END:

I am 26 years old, so I suppose I'm of the first generation that's never
experienced life /without/ email. I grew up on a farm in rural central
Missouri and my dad was very much an early adopter. (You'd be surprised
how e-enabled farmers were becoming in the early 2000s.) I cannot
remember life before the humongous satellite dish was anchored in our
front yard. Long before I had any reason to be online (or really
understood what that meant,) he began and ended every day sitting at in
front of a CRT on a corner desk, clacking away on a cigarette
smoke-yellowed plastic keyboard for hours. I did not understand why,
then, but in retrospect I realize that he was corresponding with a huge
network of neighbors, politicians, family, and college friends via email
lists/chains and that he depended on it both professionally and
personally in a big way. As a single man living at least an hour's drive
from a city of any size, I suppose my dad was predisposed to have a rich
online life long before his suburban peers, which normalized it
precociously for me.

The summer before my first grade year, my elementary school became the
first in the district to have a computer lab (also the first
air-conditioned room in the building,) so my high school graduating
class was literally the very first to have had any digital curriculum --
and an email address(!) -- for the entirety of our public school
experience. Because of this, I think most of us were trained to think of
email as a tool for school work -- it was eluded to by our computer
teachers that our school email addresses were being monitored to make
sure they remained so (obviously, they weren't.) As we grew into 6th-7th
grade, however, we all seemed to end up with personal email addresses. I
consider myself lucky to have experienced a very brief window -- before
instant messaging/early social networks became mainstream and SMS became
even remotely pleasant to use -- when my middle school friends and I
corresponded exclusively by email when we weren't on the phone.

It still sounds a bit silly to say, but I've spent the past few years
coming to believe more and more strongly that my first-generation iPhone
changed my life forever in a profound way -- /especially/ my
relationship with email. After watching
[[https://www.howtogeek.com/674796/how-to-archive-or-delete-a-facebook-group/][Steve
Job's introduction at MacWorld 2007]] live, I promised to skip a year of
Christmas gifts if my mom would agreed to buy me one, and she did.
Obviously, it was like nothing else I'd ever experienced, and it
completely changed how I responded to and thought about technology.
Before smartphones, there was no checking email outside of time in the
computer lab, which was intended to be quite strictly-regulated. I had a
real advantage when I started bringing my iPhone to school -- absolutely
no one knew what it was (a bizarre thought in contrast,) including
teachers. Suddenly able to browse and read my inbox in class, at lunch,
and on the bus, my use and consideration of email was propelled far
ahead of my peers'.

When I started an online magazine in 2016, I don't think I could've
conceived of the extent to which running a modern media company -- even
one targeted toward tech-savvy, early-adopting youth -- still involves
email. I assumed that my audience rarely /actually read/ from their
inboxes and relied almost exclusively on social networks for content
discovery, so I originally forwent any implementation of a newsletter.
As I grew more and more interested in and engaged with the media beat, I
was exposed to the email renaissance of the past 2-3 years thanks to
services like Revue and Substack, saw that it was good, and decided to
give it a try for myself. I launched our semi-regular newsletter in
April, 2017 on the subjects of “*Division*, *Art*, and *Media*” and
published a little over 30 issues over the course of 18 months. To be
honest, I'm not sure I've ever had so much fun writing.

Very shortly after it began, I observed our general engagement
quadruple, and -- quite selfishly -- found the process of aggregation to
be soothing and very mentally restorative. It exposed some pretty
horrendous media consumption habits of mine, but it also offered a
painless solution to them. As soon as everything I read became a
potential item in the newsletter, I wasn't just reading for myself
anymore (or at least, that's the mentality it gave me,) so I could no
longer afford to dismiss particular subjects as easily or to skim so
recklessly. I nurtured a much less chaotic media diet and found myself
absorbing /a lot/ more of what I wanted to without wasting so much time
burning through links. I ended up feeling more focused in other,
unrelated areas of my life, too. Obviously, I love email for that, and I
miss writing that darn newsletter so much that I continuously look for
excuses to do something similar.

My former Tech Editor loved email perhaps as much, but she's definitely
the only person I've ever met who finds the medium as /entertaining/ as
I do. (If you're /really/ committed, I just made a
[[https://twitter.com/i/events/1272514574420500481?s=13][Twitter
Moment]] full of all the best stuff I've ever posted about email --
mostly jokes like
“[[https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/921352650788130822][patron saint
of email marketing]],” but there are one or two profound posts in there,
too.) We realized one day that -- aside from The Webbys -- there are
very few notable awards celebrating excellence in the email medium, so
we decided our magazine would host the 2017 First Annual Email Awards.
Unfortunately, I don't think anyone else had any idea what the heck we
were trying to do, so we never received enough submissions. However, I
noticed a great opening paragraph in the original announcement post
which I thought made a worthy conclusion:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  Man has used electronic mail to intercommunicate, woo, build
  communities, topple businesses & civilizations, embezzle money, spread
  worms, distribute cluttered, broken links to discontinued Orscheln
  products, feed infants, set climate control, confirm identities, check
  bank account statuses, and lie to exhausted, slightly-conceited, and
  /newly self-published/ professors. That's right -- These Trillions of
  simple digijewels have purveyed /every single possible category of
  human communication/, and it's still growing strong.
#+END_QUOTE

I'm excited to give Hey a try -- I hope you'll consider inviting me
early. I'll even send my feedback if you so desire it! If not, I'll
probably end up trying a paid subscription, anyway hehe. Either way, let
me wish the best of luck to your team. Win or lose, I'm glad you're
taking action on your complaints, unlike the rest of us.

Thank you!

It's a little late to write about
[[https://letterboxd.com/film/greyhound/][/Greyhound/]] -- Tom Hanks'
[[https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000158/#writer][first screenwriting
credit]] -- which released
[[https://tv.apple.com/us/movie/greyhound/umc.cmc.o5z5ztufuu3uv8lx7m0jcega][on
Apple TV+]] this past Father's Day, June 21st. Though I definitely left
my quite severe obsession with WWII history in my prepubescence, I
thought I'd remark on this film because I originally hoped it would
fulfill a role I'd long wanted for: the destroyer-side compliment to
U-boat films like [[https://letterboxd.com/film/das-boot/][/Das Boot/]]
and [[https://letterboxd.com/film/u-571/][/U-571/]]. James D.
Hornfischer's exceptional account of the
[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Samuel_B._Roberts_(DE-413)][U.S.S.

[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_off_Samar][The Battle off Samar]]
with [[http://www.randomhousebooks.com/books/82865][/The Last Stand of
the Tin Can Sailors/]] was my last dive into naval history. It's one of
the most astounding war stories I've ever encountered, and upon first
seeing [[https://youtu.be/eyzxu26-Wqk][/Greyhound/'s trailer]], I was
sortof hoping it was the Big Boy film adaptation its always warranted.
(Though apparently there was a
[[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1068999/][TV movie]] made in 2005???)
Instead, its based on (distinct from “adapted from,” apparently) a 1955
novel by English author C.S. Forester entitled
[[https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/260852968364965888/737932123159265300/The_Good_Shepherd_-_C.S._Forester.pdf][/The
Good Shepherd/]].

Tom Hanks made sure to imbue his first screenplay with a /shitload/ of
“[[https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/jul/06/greyhound-review-tom-hanks-second-world-war-film][opaque
naval jargon]],” as /The Guardian/'s Peter Bradshaw's review put it. A
brief
[[https://www.thecinemaholic.com/greyhound-ship-world-war-ii/][“investigation”
by /The Cinemaholic/]] suggests that the U.S.S. Keeling -- the film's
singular setting -- most resembles a
[[http://destroyerhistory.org/goldplater/mahanclass/][/Mahan/-class
destroyer]], though none actually bore the name. For the actual
photography, the production made use of a surviving example of the
[[http://destroyerhistory.org/goldplater/mahanclass/][most mass-produced
destroyer]] of all time:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  When it came to shooting the film, instead of relying completely on
  sets, the crew of ‘Greyhound' found another option. They used USS
  Kidd, a real WWII destroyer, to film the journey of Greyhound. She is
  a Fletcher-class destroyer and is named after Rear Admiral Isaac C.
  Kidd, the first US flag officer to die during the Second World War.
#+END_QUOTE

As much as you're going to loathe it, I must include this commentary on
/Greyhound/'s historical accuracy if only because -- as a undoubtedly
mainstream film -- its been so widely and competently reviewed, already,
by real film writers. I am almost positive U-boats would rarely -- if
ever -- waste their precious few viable torpedo shots firing
ultra-close-range at the agile, super-speedy destroyers and destroyer
escorts that protected supply convoys, and I am /sure/ that none ever
bothered with /audibly addressing enemy ships/ over the radio in
English. I understand that dramatizing historic events is the core
function of /Greyhound/'s genre, but this particular addition was so
unbearably cheesy that it utterly decimates all of the experience's
hard-won context. Just look at a snippet from the first of two dialogues
in text:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  Greyhound. Greyhound, Greyhound.

  This is Gray Wolf.

  We hunt you and your friends Eagle, Dicky and Harry.

  We watch your ships sinking into the deep.

  We hear the screams of your comrades as they die.

  How many of them will there be before you join them?

  The Gray Wolf is so very hungry.
#+END_QUOTE

I'm sure there's an essential academic film function which only similar
enemy taunts could perform and without which this screenplay would've
been /technically/ unsound, and -- if I were allowed supposition -- I
would venture to guess that America's Favorite Dad felt pressured to
bolster his first penning against easy gimmes for the Great Big
institution of cinema criticism as much as possible. /However/, this
shit is just disruptingly cheesy. Fuck it! Have the rest:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  Greyhound!

  Your flock is not safe from this wolf.

  We can always find you in the night to kill you.

  Or will Dicky die next? Or Harry?

  [Gray Wolf howls]

  ...

  Greyhound.

  Guten Morgen, Greyhound.

  Did you think you had slipped away from this Gray Wolf?

  No, you did not. You will not.

  The sea favors the Gray Wolf on the hunt, not the hound on the run.

  You and your comrades will die today.
#+END_QUOTE

The contrast with the rest of the script's imposingly thorough and
relentlessly-paced naval action dialogue is far too abrupt to /not/ be
problematic. Even as obsessed as I was with naval history, I'm still too
oblivious to the details of what is/was actually said on the bridge of a
warship during combat maneuvers to tell you how authentic /Greyhound/'s
depiction really is (it's hardly ever shown on the screen or laid out in
nonfiction, even,) which nullifies all relevance the realism would've
had, otherwise. Director Aaron Schneider in
[[https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2020/07/greyhound-movie-tom-hanks-aaron-schneider][an
interview for /Vanity Fair/]]:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  “If you decide to read /Greyhound/ by tracking the dialogue---rudder
  commands and sonar distances---you'll soon find yourself completely
  lost. Because that's not where the movie lives. This screenplay was
  designed to beam you aboard the USS /Keeling/...and it's up to you to
  engage with what's going on and extrapolate how things work, so you
  can answer the question, ‘What the hell is going on here?'”
#+END_QUOTE

In this sense -- crafting a consuming, believable, unbelievably gray,
claustrophobic, icing iron reality -- Tom Hanks excels.

Though Letterboxd user [[https://letterboxd.com/brucewayn/][brucewayn]]
called it “boring” in
[[https://letterboxd.com/brucewayn/film/greyhound/][the most popular
review of the film]] to date on the platform, I found /Greyhound/ to be
quite engaging in an anxious, depressing sense familiar to classic war
dramas like /Saving Private Ryan/ and /Black Hawk Down/. The tedium of
naval warfare's endless orienteering is rescaled to a battlefield of
lesser distances -- axis and allied vessels actually collide on several
occasions and a U-boat crew decides to /fuck it all/ and brawl it out
with two parallel destroyers with surface guns instead of retreating
after losing their ability to dive. (See:
[[https://youtu.be/4uOcE_IIi30][/Titanic VI/]].) Through a combination
of wartime compression and stitching, /Greyhound/ is in large part a
mashup of naval action at the extremes of what historical fiction will
allow within its 48-hour setting. From Ben Lindbergh's
[[https://www.theringer.com/movies/2020/7/9/21318481/tom-hanks-greyhound-review][review
for /The Ringer/]]:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  In /The Good Shepherd/, enemy torpedoes simply sail wide; in the
  movie, they graze the hull for even closer calls. In the book, Krause
  agonizes over, and generally resists, calling the crew to general
  quarters, wary of exhausting their energy reserves; in the movie, he
  doesn't hesitate to summon his sailors to battle stations.
#+END_QUOTE

The result is an emotionally effective film constrained by a very
specific dramatic aim: another war movie every father can juice for
decades' worth of Sunday afternoons on the sofa. “As befits his status
as America's Dad, Hanks has constructed for us the ultimate Dad Movie
--- all the action you could ever need or want, with no annoying
characters hanging around, harboring pesky needs and wants of their
own,”
[[https://www.npr.org/2020/07/10/888899608/world-war-ii-naval-drama-greyhound-charts-a-trim-efficient-course][quips
Glen Weldon for /NPR/]]. Undoubtedly, though, the subject matter is
fresh. I wouldn't say my youth desire for a surface-side
Atlantic-theatre film is 100% satiated, but /Greyhound/ managed to
accomplish much more than I expected.

** I've got some fucking opinions about SoundCloud...
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: section0093.xhtml#i-ve-got-some-fucking-opinions-about-soundcloud
   :END:

My friend Sierra has used SoundCloud almost exclusively for her music
discovery, consumption, and recommendations, but has remained resolute
in her unwillingness to financially invest in the service. As such, her
listening is regularly interrupted by ads and limited to bitrates
[[https://www.magneticmag.com/2018/01/soundcloud-lowers-sound-quality-uploads-half/][as
low as 64kbps]]. Since I was last employed, I have maintained a vow to
her that I would pay for a subscription to SoundCloud Go+ -- the premium
/listener/ tier of the service -- with my own money, once I was once
again in place at a steady job. This move would remove all advertising
from her listening and
[[https://help.soundcloud.com/hc/en-us/articles/360010227514-High-Quality-Streaming][up
its bitrate to 256kbps]], among
[[https://checkout.soundcloud.com/go][other benefits]].

Two nights ago, we were refueling her car in preparation for another one
of our recreational drives into rural Missouri when I made the decision
on a whim to simply signup for a trial of Go+ on
[[https://soundcloud.com/chordoslut][my own account]] using Apple Pay,
mostly because I knew we'd be going out of effective cell network range
and one of Go+'s most emphasized features is its ability to download
music locally. (Since my Apple Music subscription expired earlier this
year, I only have
[[https://bigkrit.com/music/king-remembered-in-time/][a single album]]
actually downloaded on my phone.)

[[https://soundcloud.com/keithjarrettofficial/rio-part-v]]

*** The above is what I wrote several weeks ago, just as I was beginning
my trial period. Now, having experienced a significant amount of time as
a SoundCloud Go user, I am a bit sad that my trial is over. To be
honest, I fully intended to become a paying subscriber, but my PayPal
account was $0.70 short of the $12.99 monthly fee when the first billing
cycle came, two weeks ago. This is not a conclusion I expected to come
to, as SoundCloud's fundamental arrangement could not possibly differ
any more from the music streaming service I long claimed as my ideal
own: Apple Music.

One major worry I would imagine potential subscribers may have when
approaching SoundCloud as a replacement for their single music
subscription service would revolve around the extent of SoundCloud's
establishment music industry library. There's no way your Dad's Sunday
barbecue playlist is going to be on /SoundCloud/, right? Strangely
enough, I was unable to find a single track that /was not/ in the
library. From my own favorite
[[https://soundcloud.com/keithjarrettofficial][Keith Jarrett's
archives]] to
[[https://soundcloud.com/dixiechicks/sets/gaslighter-2][the new Dixie
Chicks album]], every bit of big time record label-distributed music I
could conceieve of could be found aside the Go+ badge (though notably,
neither of these showed significant playcounts.) As far as the app
experience goes, I /swear/ it got smoother as soon as I signed up for
Go+. This is probably bullshit, but regardless, with the seemingly
ever-widening disparity in the experiences of free vs. premium users,
SoundCloud appears to be moving actively away from the former.

[[file:xhtml/https:/i.snap.as/78HwnfKK.png]]

I have long said (somewhat in jest) that
[[https://soundcloud.com/chancetherapper][Chance The Rapper]] is the
only reason SoundCloud still exists.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  From a future historian's perspective, the battle for the definitive
  name in independent digital music distribution has already won,
  largely thanks to its relationship with Chance The Rapper, who's
  quickly become a “cultural influencer, thought leader, global star,”
  and one of my generation's upmost celebrity champions. Obviously,
  there is little sense trying to determine whether SoundCloud /earned/
  his partnership or landed their popular association with his name as
  long as the artist maintains it publicly, while continuing to
  [[https://soundcloud.com/pitchfork/pitchfork-presents-in-sight-out-chance-the-rapper][give
  new meaning]] to the phrase “serially likable.”
  -“[[https://bilge.world/bandcamp-streaming-music][Bandcamp:

#+END_QUOTE

If /[[https://www.cnet.com/news/chance-the-rapper-soundcloud/][CNET_ was
asking the question]] a year before that Bandcamp essay, I think I can
feel properly varified. What I'd really like to know, now: does Chance
still feel the same way about the streaming service after the launch of
SoundCloud Go+? Considering that I am far from a /real/ music
journalist, I do not have any more contact resources than you have. That
said, I left [a comment on his Facebook
Page]([[https://www.facebook.com/chancetherapper/posts/3299672310124810?comment=][https://www.facebook.com/chancetherapper/posts/3299672310124810?comment]]/id=3319045628187478).
I guess we'll see.

Some more technical bits: SoundCloud is now castable on Chromecast, but
/not/ supported by Apple CarPlay, for whatever that's worth. Notably
apart from Bandcamp and Apple Music and aligned with Spotify, SoundCloud
is explicitly investing in algorithmic music discovery, which means its
users are doing the curatorial work. /I/ am doing/have done the
curatorial work. That means the DnB crowd is going to receieve Toto
recommendations, given what I sought out for this post. You're welcome,
and sorry...

1. While I was surprisingly unable to find any Tweets or Evernotes
   further evangelizing Apple Music (I suspect I'm thinking of an old,
   untranscribed /Drycast/ episode,) I found real magic in the service
   as I perceieved it: $9.99 a month for /all of iTunes/. 13 year-old me
   would considerthat one helluva deal.
2. Naturally, if you know of one, please do comment and/or
   [[https://www.davidblue.wtf/contact/][drop me a line]].
3. In fact, it is the only streaming app I found that _does not _have
   CarPlay support. Even Bandcamp and MixCloud for iOS do!

I finally did it, ladies and gentlemen... I managed to break the Windows
installation on my [[https://www.davidblue.wtf/t/surface/][Microsoft
Surface Laptop 2]] to such an extent that it has been unrecoverable. I
am currently borrowing my mother's MacBook Pro and waiting on a Windows
10 installation .ISO file to download so that I can hope to mount it
correctly on the last, shitty USB thumb drive I still have lying around.

[[file:xhtml/https:/i.snap.as/GG9y4pmC.png]]

/YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT BITCH./

I now suspect I began down this path a few months ago when I discovered
[[https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2020/06/15/introducing-windows-insider-channels/][Windows
Insider Channels]] and rejoiced... As I've discovered that one can
relatively easily find a beta version of virtually /any/ piece of
software, it's become a bit of a habit for me. More or less
unconsciously, I've ended up with an application library full of
/Developer Beta/ and /Nightly/ /Build/-type shit. I don't think there
was/is a single web browser installed on that machine that is not the
given entity's “Developer Edition” which -- considering most of the
regular installs allow you to opt into dev tools, anyway -- seem like
they might be redundant. I don't particularly care, anymore -- I mostly
just love their icons.
[[https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/developer/][Firefox Developer
Edition]]'s logo is a blue Firefox(!,)
[[https://www.microsoftedgeinsider.com/en-us/download][Edge Chromium
Dev]]'s is... more interesting than the regular version.
[[https://www.google.com/chrome/canary/][Google Chrome Canary]]'s icon
is a surprisingly-tasteful variation of the company's usually-horrendous
color palette.

What I'm trying to say is... I have continued upon this habit of opting
for unstable versions of software in a sort of defiance against the
common sense notion that relying upon them is generally a /bad
idea/.[^1] I suppose I was just *waiting to experience any consequences*
from such a decision, and well... Here they are!

It all began when my Surface's integrated webcam became invisible to all
applications that used a video input -- including Microsoft's own Camera
app and OBS. It showed up in Device Manger, where I did the
generally-recommended troubleshooting task of uninstalling it completely
(including its drivers) and rebooting to force Windows to reinstall it.
It did so successfully every time, to no effect on the original issue. I
also went into the Surface's BIOS menu, where its hardware devices are
explicitly listed, and disabled/re-enabled the camera, to no effect.
Normally, the absence of a webcam function would be more or less
irrelevant to my day-to-day workflow, but now that
[[https://www.davidblue.wtf/college-return/][I'm partaking in “virtual”
college courses]], at least one of my professors has pressured me to
appear /on cam/ as soon as possible.

On Sunday night, I decided to revisit the problem with greater
commitment, diving into a variety of deeper troubleshooting steps which
I do not recall. The crucial one, though, was my decision to use the
System File Checker tool =(sfc /scannow)= with the added instruction to
/fix/ whatever errors it found.[^2] This drove my dearest little laptop
into a cycle of self-diagnoses which results in an option screen
including “Reset PC.” After trying virtually every other option, I
decided to try resetting, only to be met with connectivity error
messages after pursuing the “Install via Network” option, leaving the
use of a bootable Windows 10 recovery USB as my only choice, in theory.

Another problem now arose: my mother's MacBook Pro is the only other
machine I have any sort of access to at the moment, and MacOS no longer
supports the creation of such a bootable USB for Windows via the Boot
Camp Utility any longer. Nevertheless, I tried to make one by
downloading the correct OS ISO and mounting it via UNetbootin, which
didn't work. I then called [[https://www.colcomputers.com/][Columbia
Computer Center]], who very generously agreed to make one for me and
only charge me for the drive itself ($10!)

Unfortunately, that one hasn't worked either, so I'm afraid I'm just
going to have to take the thing to them...
[[https://www.davidblue.wtf/t/surface/][Stay tuned]] for the Final
Verdict.

[1] This is why I've always downloaded the developer iOS beta releases
on my actual, daily driver handset.

[2] I'm pretty sure it was “-f” but I'm not going to do the research to
verify that... Sorry!

As with my [[https://bilge.world/hp-spectre-x360-review][entire
history]] of computer purchases, my acquisition of an
[[https://support.hp.com/us-en/document/c06443577][HP ENVY Desktop
tower]], today, was last-minute, ill-informed, and certainly irrational.
You “PC master race” folk: please spare me the /dude, you could've just
built your own pc so much cheaper/ shit.[^1] Yes, I realize the sensible
course of action would've begun with a two hour trip West to the closest
Microcenter, where I'm sure the staff would've made PC shopping an
absolute blast and I would've come away with a more powerful, much
cheaper machine. However, after I managed to
[[https://www.davidblue.wtf/finally-broke-windows/][break Windows]] on
my only machine this weekend (and subsequently failed to reset it,) I
was getting especially behind on schoolwork and had /absolutely no
desire/ to complete any of it on my iPhone.

And so... I've just returned from picking up said HP Tower along with a
[[https://store.hp.com/us/en/pdp/hp-27f-27-inch-display#!][27” HP LED
display]], and am writing you after having set up the machine physically
and installed most of my “essential software” list (at least all that I
could remember.) As per my favorite tradition of new computer

** “First Impressions”
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: section0095.xhtml#first-impressions
   :END:

It's been exactly 10 years since I last bought a desktop tower -- since
I first set hands on the Dell XPS Studio desktop with which I would
create the majority of my intellectual property -- and I was immediately
surprised by how much smaller (6.12 x 11.93 x 13.28 inches) and lighter
(13.12 lbs.) this tower was than my expectations. The display, too, is
remarkably light and thin. Rationally, I should not have been surprised
by this, but I'm not going to punish myself for continuing to find any
sort of magic in technology.

In the box were a Bluetooth keyboard -- specifically, an HP model
[[https://fccid.io/EMJKHSA-P003K][4251a-khsap003k]] -- and mouse set,
the latter of which I will hopefully never have to use, thanks to my
[[https://youtu.be/oIAY1-aW8Es][Logitech G203]] -- and was perplexed by
the process of how to pair the former with the tower while it was in
setup mode for far too long. I was just about to give up entirely when I
revisited the packaging and noticed what I'd previously assumed was an
anti-theft device, but was actually the fucking dongle for the pair. I
continue to despise Bluetooth peripherals, obviously, but the multimedia
function keys of the product led to some important realizations: I now
had reason to use Windows Desktop Switching /and/ have a calculator
application again! However, I have yet to figure out how to alter the
Function key's behavior (I'm not even sure it's possible:) in order to
input *Alt+F4*, I have to input *Fn+Alt+F4*, which is far too clunky to
depend on. The issue did lead to a revelation which I may or may not
integrate permanently: I mapped *Alt+F4* to the previously-unused button
on the very top of the G203. So far, it's been pretty nifty.

That said, a component of my intention to create an intentional, static,
upright-sitting desktop workspace included an allotment for a quality
mechanical keyboard -- my justification was that any professional in a
particular craft makes a point to have the best possible tools for the
job, so a high-quality keyboard has actually been /very/ long overdue,
in my case. So, I sought out
[[https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/our-favorite-mechanical-keyboards/][a
single /Wirecutter/ recommendations list]] and even attempted to
disseminate
[[https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/][r/MechanicalKeyboards]].[^2]
After a brief jaunt, I concluded that no reasonable person would be able
to make heads or tails of the forum or
[[https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/wiki/index][its seemingly
endless wikis]] without considerable indoctrination so I more or less
threw a dart and landed on the
[[https://mechanicalkeyboards.com/shop/index.php?l=product_detail&p=3504][Varmilo
VA108M]], which I ordered. All I know is that it's fairly
highly-reviewed on the marketplaces I checked (though hardly mentioned
on the subreddit, actually,) and that it has the /Cherry Switches/,
which are...
[[https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/comments/d3hmw3/my_new_baby_varmilo_108m_cherry_mx_blues_the/][The
good ones]].

A concern I originally had with taking over the tertiary guest room --
by far the smallest allotted living space in the house -- as my office
was its distance from our wireless router, two floors down. The last
time I used the room as a workspace (five years ago,) my old tower's
integrated WiFi card often struggled to maintain a reliable connection.
The adapter included in this desktop, though, actually managed to clock

It's almost painful even to write this but... As beautiful as this $250
display is to behold, I've grown accustomed to my
[[https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/surface/business/surface-laptop-2][Surface
Laptop 2]]'s *2256 x 1504 13”* display after years of hard, daily use.
Apparently, those dimensions mean the little machine's display has a
pixel density of *201 Pixels-Per-Inch*. Filling a *27”* display with
just *1920 x 1080* means a pixel density of just *81.6
Pixels-Per-Inch*,[^3] and the disparity was glaring to my eyes, even
from the setup screen. After a few hours of regular use, I'm not sure I
notice it anymore, but I suspect I will again when I've got the laptop
running again. Please do indicate whether or not you think such a
complaint makes me awful in the [[https://poll.fm/10603399][Crowdsignal

I've also already had trouble connecting my
[[https://www.bose.com/en_us/support/products/bose_headphones_support/bose_around_ear_headphones_support/soundlink-around-ear-wireless-headphones-ii.html][Bose
SoundLink headphones]] correctly via Bluetooth. On my Surface Laptop, it
registered as two separate devices -- “Stereo Headphones” and “Headset”
-- which allowed me to use them as both the primary audio output /and/
the primary audio input. For whatever reason, I have been unable to
accomplish such a simultaneous connection on this machine: I can either
connect them as headphones or as a headset, but not both.
[[https://youtu.be/55yn-zF_dZY][This video]] provided some help -- I
know now that I have to open Sound Settings and manually connect the
headphones every time I re-connect them. Hopefully, I'll figure out
another solution soon.

Returning to the webcam issue: I discovered that absolutely /zero/ local
stores keep add-on webcams in stock anymore, which makes sense. I
resorted to searching Amazon for webcams and found a gargantuan list of
brands I had never heard of. When I filtered by the one I /did/
recognize -- Logitech -- I saw barely-facelifted versions of the camera
my stepdad bought in 2008 and none were in stock. Unwilling to further
investigate or research more, I set the price filter for under $40,
sorted by customer ratings, and bought the first product which had even
remotely legitimate-looking reviews:

After returning to the order invoice hours later for this post, I got
curious enough to Google search the company name and discovered a

Yes, I bought a mechanical keyboard. It occurred to me that folks who
spend a lot of time doing things that require tools -- /professionals/,
artisans, craftsmen, etc. -- usually seek out the best possible quality
offerings of those tools. Even if they're just 5% better than the
average alternatives and cost twice as much, when one uses them for
hours every day, the last bit of refinement pays off very quickly.
Considering how much typing I've done in the past 5-10 years, I find it
a bit silly that I hadn't before thought to optimize the hardware I've
used to do so. Now that I've put at least some thought into designing
the space in which I work and
[[https://www.davidblue.wtf/college-return/][gone back to school]], I've
also invested in bettering the thing my hands actually touch the most.

***** Actually... Before I go on,

I suppose I've let myself be blinded to the advantages of a mechanical
keyboard by the /gaemer/ stigma that surrounds them. This time, I
believe I began by simply inputting something like “best keyboard for
typing” into a search engine, which returns plenty of iffy results,
naturally, but among them was
[[https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/our-favorite-mechanical-keyboards/][a
list from /Wirecutter/]] -- whom I trust, more or less -- of “Best
Mechanical Keyboards 2020.” Also included were posts in the
[[https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/][r/MechanicalKeyboards
subreddit]], which I /actually fucking joined/[^1] (but promise never to
mention again outside of this post.) Uncovering my eyes, I found a
ridiculously-extensive community message board and
[[https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/wiki][Wiki]], which is
undoubtedly the most extensive resource on the subject to be found,
anywhere. Though I did place a time limit on myself for any research of
15 minutes, in retrospect, I suppose I also had some criteria, which I
assume -- if you're still reading -- you might be interested in:

- *WIRED* as fuck. Bluetooth can /fuck off/.
- “Full” keyboard, for the same reason I'd never spend any money on a
  piano with any less than 88 keys.
- At least tolerably tasteful, aesthetically. (Not overwhelmingly
  embarrassing if someone were to actually see me using it.)
- Cute, ideally.
- No light shows.
- Not “ergonomic.”
- Not from Logitech or Microsoft.

Immediately, it was overwhelmingly clear that my choice must also have
/The Cherry/... The Cherries... The “Cherry MX Switches,” whatever they
are. /Any/ of even the most skimmy reading up on the subject will lead
you to this conclusion. That addressed, I arrived upon three
considerations: the
[[https://www.duckychannel.com.tw/en/Ducky-One2-RGB-TKL][Ducky One 2]],

/Layout of the VA108M seen from above./

As good as the idea of something as German as the Das Keyboard sounded,
I hate the way it looks, and the Ducky seemed to take itself too
seriously (despite its brand name.) The VA87M seemed to be ideal if it
was full-sized. I searched for the equivalent,
[[http://mechanicalkeyboards.com/shop/index.php?l=product_detail&p=2855][found
the VA108M]], and bought one immediately. Specifically...

I've already written more than I ever wanted to, but let me just say
that I love everything about the thing -- the particular set of special
keys, the way it feels & sounds, and that its heft prevents it from
moving around -- and I hope to keep it forever. As I said on the
photographs I posted to social media, *I promise to never bring this or
any other mechanical keyboard up ever again* unless asked about it.

[1] Yes, I have actually been using the Read It website in the past 18
months or so, which anyone who's known me at all would find
unbelievable. I don't know if I'll write about it in the future, so I'll
just say I've unblocked it within my psyche largely because it's no
longer horrendous to look at.

[2] I remain genuinely confused as to why the color of the switches
matters, considering they are only visible when the keycaps have been
removed.

It is my privilege and my curse to write about every new major iteration
to Apple's mobile operating system, though I skipped iOS 13 last year,
which was largely dominated by Dark Mode, the iPad OS fork, and Memoji
-- which I could care less about, honestly -- and didn't warrant my
investment in a Full Post, I felt. The Photos app improvements were very
welcome, but I'd departed from iCloud as my primary storage service, so
I didn't have anything relevant to say. iOS 14 is also mostly irrelevant
to my own personal use, but represents a more abstract shift in design
philosophy that I thought was worth commenting on. For myself,
everything about it adds anxiety, beginning with the launch, itself, at
[[https://youtu.be/GEZhD3J89ZE][Apple's WWDC 2020]], which I watched,
live, and
[[https://twitter.com/i/events/1275137514609823751?s=20][Tweeted

   :END:

My technology writing over the years has largely centered around my awe
and confusion regarding what I've perceived as a divergent path from the
future I once imagined. My closest guess as to this divergence's origin
is the announcement of iOS7, with Apple's
[[https://www.theguardian.com/technology/shortcuts/2013/jun/12/skeuomorphism-apple-ditched-ios7][abandonment
of skeuomorphic design]] in favor of an entirely new, “flatter” UX
visual language, which I actually found quite jarring.
[[https://snap.as/extratone/retrospective][In retrospect]], though, of
course I'm glad they did so. I thought this was an importat preface to
any thoughts I have about [[https://youtu.be/GEZhD3J89ZE][today's WWDC
Keynote]] -- they will probably seem idiotic in a year or so (they might
to you already.)

[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i243Fn1HwOY]]

Thanks to The Big Beer Virus, this was Apple's first pre-recorded WWDC
presentation (though the word “live” continued to be used on several
occasions,) which made it especially surreal. During the wait for the
Keynote to “go live,” the stream was occupied by an
[[https://twitter.com/GoncaloCdM/status/1275110234000969728][animated
Earth]] from orbit. As the clock rolled over the hour's top, AURORA's
“[[https://song.link/us/i/1457598185][Daydreamer]]” faded in and we
began to grow closer to this Earth, gradually revealing that it was
covered with millions of floating memoji in various states behind their
animated MacBooks. Like much of the event to follow, this scene became
more and more anxiety-inducing as we grew closer to the mob (keep in
mind that I've never really found memoji cute, unlike plenty of folks.)
Eventually, we changed pitch dramatically and plunged through a hole in
the clouds straight toward the incenter of the spaceship at Apple Park,
through the door, down the staircase, and into a completely empty -- but
fully lit -- Steve Jobs theatre, where Tim Cook emerged on stage and
almost immediately began to

entire aura of this update: it's complicated. /The Verge/'s Dieter Bohn
receives this new complication positively in an

Screen*, *Jiggle Mode* and *Editing Pages*, the *App Library*, and *App
Clips*. (Yes, in many ways, linking to the essay makes this post
redundant.)

--------------

That's what I wrote about WWDC. iOS 14 officially released five days
ago, now, and folks are already showcasing some crazy homescreen
modifications on Twitter in
[[https://twitter.com/search?f=image&q=%23ios14homescreen&src=typeahead_click][]][[https://bilge.world/tag:ios14homescreen][#ios14homescreen]].
I would go into detail, but I'm honestly not all that curious about the
process, which is unusual. I hope more than anything that I am not
loosing my curiosity or playfulness regarding iOS which not so long ago
propelled [[https://bilge.world/siri-shortcuts-ios12-review][an
exuberant exploration of Shortcuts' capabilities]] during their early
days as an integrated Apple property with the release of iOS 12.

[[https://twitter.com/ragulover123/status/1307461503948394496]]

Basically, I'm not going to do the full bit, this year, but I'd like to
address some of the notes I /did/ take throughout the past few months of
the developer beta. Notably, there is simply far less to iOS 14 that's
relevant to my life, personally, than any other release I remember, /but
that's okay/. It's just a wee bit more difficult to motivate myself to
talk about it. If there's one definite statement to be made about this
release, it's that *it is /additive/ rather than /transformative/*. As
Dieter Bohn so elequently put it for /The Verge/:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  For the iPhone, the overarching theme is that they're finally letting
  it get complicated. The home screen starts simple, but it can be
  complex if you want it to and Apple's also finally putting different
  elements on top of other elements so you can see Siri on top of your
  current screen instead of taking over the whole screen.

/Yes, I do find the title of that article quite ironic considering what
I just articulated to you./

The title of
[[https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/24/21299924/ios-14-iphone-wwdc-2020-apple-home-screen-widgets-app-library-clips-pages-complexity][his
penultimate review]], additionally, includes the summation “Apple is
finally lettting the iPhone homescreen get complicated.” Yes...
/Complexity/. I'll be honest: I've actually had the opportunity to play
around quite a bit with Android 11 thanks to Android Studio on my PCs,
and I found it tremendously underwhelming as an alternative. On a
virtual Pixel 3, the experience was functionally no more than a fucking
/material design/-tasting, /slightly/ varied execution of a smartphone
operating system in comparison. I should disclaim, though, that these
weeks with early iOS widget implementation -- which represents quite a
hefty chunk of this release's significance, I think we can all agree --
have led me to the conclusion that I personally /do not believe/ in
widgets. Or at least -- I do not have the usership vocabulary to even
begin integrating them into my own handset-using life.[efn_note]I'd
elaborate but honestly, who cares, really?[/efn_note]

To focus a bit, let's look specifically at a /Gizmodo/ article published
this past Wednesday:
“[[https://gizmodo.com/17-things-you-can-do-in-ios-14-that-you-couldn-t-do-bef-1844975020][17
Things You Can Do in iOS 14 That You Couldn't Do Before]]:”

1.  *App Clips*: Oh boy... I'm so physically, mentally, and spiritually
    exhausted. Just gonna say /no/ to that one.
2.  *Add widgets to the home screen*: I'm going to assume it's Android
    users who've stigmatised dynamic home screen widgets as a desirable
    outlet of development resources. I simply cannot fathom any bit of
    data which would be truly be /constructively/ consumed there, as
    opposed to unlocking the device and navigating to whatever
    application it originated from. Perhaps I'm just old and slow.
3.  *Send apps to the App Library*: Directly related, actually. Still
    considering how I assume most folks actually navigate to
    applications that have been in folders or in secondary+ homescreens
    to date -- that is, dragging down and typing a handful of characters
    into Spotlight search -- I'm not sure an alphabetized listing of all
    apps is really that useful. I know I'm not alone on this one:
    iJustine expressed an identical assumption
    [[https://anchor.fm/samebrain/episodes/WWDC-Rumors--PS5-hype-and-Animal-Crossing-efmf8f][on
    an episode of her podcast, /Same Brain/]].
4.  *Hide some of your home screens*: (I repeat the exact same
    argument.)
5.  *Watch videos with picture-in-picture mode*: Once again, I could
    definitely be showing my age, but what really constitues /watching/
    when you're talking about a fractional segment of a ~6 inch display?
    You may as well just be listening to the audio, right?
6.  *Pin conversations in Messages*: I'm afraid the text conversation
    pinning feature doesn't really apply to someone like myself, who
    literally never messages anyone but my girlfriend and my mom. All
    pinning the conversations accomplishes for me is the obfuscation of
    the handy in-line timestamp found in the normal list view.
7.  *Mention your contacts in Messages*: Jesus... And we're still using
    fucking /SMS/?
8.  *Add more variety to your memojis*: I still have not figured out how
    to actually use memojies, practically, so...
9.  *Get suggested smart home automations*: I'm sorry... What did you
    say? I'm not familiar with those words.
10. *Get to bed on time*: Clarification: “iOS 14 works with watchOS 7
    (or on its own) to help you get to sleep at the right time each
    night, with reminders and Do Not Disturb options.” If you were truly
    /at all/ interested in not being disturbed /or/ getting lots of
    sleep, you wouldn't have spent $300 on a machine to strap to your
    wrist who's *primary function* is to disturb you!
11. *Translate websites in Safari*: Christ... /Really/? How have I not
    encountered an issue with this before?
12. *Search inside apps*: *There we go!* The first item on this list
    that suggests anyone at Apple /actually uses iOS/!
13. *Get more detailed weather forecasts*: Dark Sky acquision... All
    this one does is remind me that Apple's self-restraint could breach

14. *Use your iPhone as a translator*: Well... Yeah... Anything that

    that it didn't know in iOS 13---you'll have to try and test it out
    yourself. According to Apple, Siri now knows 20 times the number of
    facts that it did three years ago, and we haven't been able to catch
    it out with anything so far.”
16. *Get cycling directions in Apple Maps*: No! Cut that out!
17. *Plan a journey in an electric vehicle*: I'm not joking when I
    suggest that this fits perfectly into iOS 14's /Anxiety Mode

Yes, there /are/ examples of genuine progress. The Guides feature in
Maps (seen above) probably could/should have been added a long time ago,
but at least Apple executed it quite elegantly. I'm could've /sworn/

or something, but perhaps I was thinking of

*Wallpapers for CarPlay* are one of those features that didn't occur to
me to want, but I did/do. Also -- though my personal experience with
CarPlay has been limited -- I can definitely imagine more layout options
(“Horizontal status bar”) will be useful in /fringe/ use cases.

And that's it! All of my notes have now been crossed off! Now I can
finally forget I ever spent time thinking about iOS this year... Gourd

/You have a desire for indulgence in your home and family/,
[[https://www.costarastrology.com/neoyokel][Co-Star]] has just told me
in my weekly, email newsletter-delivered horoscope. “Venus conjunct to
natal Moon” indicates /this part of yourself will transform into
something else/, and goes on to say something truly stirring: **the way
you relate to your past is changing**. I continue to be amazed by how
influential the potential of the computing hardware present in my life
at any given time can be on my habits. In the two weeks I've had
[[https://www.davidblue.wtf/hp-envy-desktop/][my first moderately
powerful desktop computer]] in over ten years, I have found myself using
new image & video editing software, installing local WordPress stacks,
finally experimenting with Git, somehow generating 20 draft posts on
[[https://www.davidblue.wtf/][a fresh experimental WordPress site]], and
putting my whole back into my new Notion account, including -- among
others -- projects like my
“[[https://www.notion.so/rotund/Keyboard-Shortcuts-Wiki-9b4567d5b41447638cd6330aed7c2a1b][Keyboard
Shortcuts Wiki]].” All the while, there has been a pull toward a more
deliberate, focused sort of digital existence: reflection on
[[https://www.kevinmcgillivray.net/word/][Kevin McGillivray's Word of
The Year concept]],
[[https://tomcritchlow.com/blogchains/digital-gardens/][digital
gardening]], and a few other like discoveries have culminated in a
newfound, unironic use of the term
“[[https://www.notion.so/rotund/Creative-Wellness-b43e3df6f4b94333aa97ea98b67cb760][Creative
Wellness]]” to describe a set of ideologies which I believe I should
strive for in order to improve my intellectual wellbeing.

In tandem with the fact that I have
[[https://www.davidblue.wtf/college-return/][gone back to school]], this
has all crucially resulted in very little /actual writing/, which may or
may not be conclusive evidence toward the classical minimalist
technology argument that less capability results in more focus. On that
note, remember when
[[https://www.theverge.com/2014/5/14/5716232/george-r-r-martin-uses-dos-wordstar-to-write][the
/Game of Thrones/ author appeared on Conan's show]] and mentioned that
he still writes exclusively using WordStar 4.0? This happening has been
vaguely in the back of my mind since I encountered it during the
relatively brief, basement apartment-dwelling era in Oregon when I first
discovered WinWorldPC and got into running a bunch of DOS VMs, trying
out every download from that blessed site which sounded even remotely
interesting. Before I go on, let me just include a transcript of the
entire anecdote I'm referring to here, because it's actually much
shorter than one is led to believe:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Conan*: These novels that that you write are can be over a thousand
  pages long. They're massive tomes and apparently you write them all on
  a computer, but unlike most authors, you're not worried about a
  computer virus. I mean an author who writes a thousand-page book their
  greatest fear is a virus invades and destroys a chunk of their book
  you don't worry about that. Why?

  *Martin*: No I have a secret weapon -- I actually have two computers:
  I have the computer that I browse the internet with and that I get my
  email on and I do my taxes on and that computer and then I have my
  writing computer which is a DOS machine not connected to the Internet.

  *Conan*: A DOS machine. How old is this program?

  *Martin*: A DOS machine. You remember DOS? I use WordStar 4.0 as my
  word processing system.

  *Conan*: Did you make this computer out of wood? Did you carve it? I'm
  curious why you decided to stick with this old program.

  *Martin*: I actually like it. I mean, it does everything I want a word
  processing program to do, and it doesn't do anything else. I don't
  want any help. I hate some of these modern systems where you type a
  lowercase letter and it becomes a capital. I don't want a capital --
  if I wanted a capital, I would've typed a capital. I know how to work
  the shift key. Stop fixing it!

  *Conan*: You yell at computers a lot. What about spellcheck?

  *Martin*: Oh, I hate spellcheck. Especially when you have the realm of
  [???], it's [???].
#+END_QUOTE

That's it! A less than sixty second exchange. I did not remember just
how much coverage it received on digital news sites. Embark on a Google
search for
“[[https://www.google.com/search?q=george+rr+martin+wordstar][george rr
martin wordstar]],” and you'll discover a ridiculously long list of
brief stories including the YouTube embed. A book I've just recently
discovered and begun -- which I am extremely excited about -- is
Professor Matthew G. Kirschenbaum's
[[https://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674417076][/Track
Changes: A Literary History of Word Processing/]], and its introduction
begins by mentioning /The George Thing/, which surely indicates that it
is the most significant mention of word processing software in popular
culture for at least a decade:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  The clip was posted to YouTube and from there embedded in innumerable
  tweets, Facebook feeds, and blogs. Some commenters immediately, if
  indulgently, branded Martin a Luddite, while others opined it was no
  wonder it was taking him so long to finish the whole story (or less
  charitably, no wonder that it all seemed so interminable). But what
  was it about these seemingly obscure details that people found so
  compelling? Part of it was no doubt the unexpected blend of novelty
  and nostalgia: Many fans would be old enough to remember WordStar for
  themselves, and the intricacy of its interface seems somehow in
  keeping with Martin's quirky persona, part paternalistic grandfather
  and part /Doctor Who/ character. WordStar thus becomes an accessory to
  his public image, like the black fisherman's cap he is frequently
  photographed wearing. But it is also clearly much more than that.
  Martin's passion for the program is unmistakable...
#+END_QUOTE

The book, itself, was also more widely reviewed than one would expect,
where it was deemed genuinely unique. I /related/ quite hard to the
preface's first few sentences:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  /Track Changes/ began, as many books do, with a question: What was the
  first novel written with a word processor? Being an English professor
  interested in the history of writing as well as computers, I thought
  it was the sort of thing I should know, but I didn't.
#+END_QUOTE

Discovering the volume was a result of a personal determination in the
last week to give in to my latent obsession with word processing/text
editing software, which also led to my creating
[[https://www.notion.so/rotund/0f3f754d5a4b46cb99bd3e1c0a2e1159?v=a85e98bc06424b72a3a249a87cb62101][a
Notion table of every word processor I've ever heard of]]. Thanks to my
desktop PC acquisition, found myself virtual machining a bit again,
though some of the programs I'm particularly interested in trying have
inexplicitly disappeared from my personal library and been removed from
WinWorldPC, probably due to (mostly absurd) copyright claims. Most
versions of WordStar are
[[https://winworldpc.com/product/wordstar][still available]], though,
and I'll confess I still have a desire to learn how to use its cult
keyboard shortcuts,
[[https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2017/03/wordstar-a-writers-word-processor/][as
evangelized by Robert J. Sawyer in an essay]] /also/ discussed in /Track
Changes/, which specifically shits on WordPerfect more explicitly than I
remembered. I keep returning to the idea that I should try writing the
stuff I normally work on -- like this post, for instance -- in these
software, but file transfer is a bigger and bigger obstacle the older
the OS you're running: VirutalBox's
“[[https://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch04.html][Guest Additions]]” --
which allow clipboard sharing/shared folders/other interoperative
network functions -- are not compatible with DOS or any Windows editions
before 4.0. There are workarounds, but I haven't found any reasonably
within my current abilities.

Truthfully, though, emulating twenty-year-old software seems a bit
unnecessary when contrasted with the fact that Markdown, Typora, and
Writeas were [[https://write.as/community/chat-with-david-blue][supposed
to be my saviors]] from distracted writing. A compulsion to comment on a
[[https://www.theinformation.com/articles/tech-execs-are-obsessing-over-note-taking-apps-we-tested-them-out][recent
note-taking app comparison published in /The Information/]] reminded me
that I /still/ haven't written an in-depth review of Typora, which I
plan to prioritize in the near future, especially since it may finally
be officially releasing, according to

Another result of my reintroduction to academia is that I can now afford
a subscription to Adobe Creative Cloud thanks to student discounts. This
has been life-changing in a manner which I should probably be a bit
ashamed of, but once the desire to /make full use/ of my subscription
(by trying every single program it licenses) subsides, I really do
intend to become proficient with
[[https://www.davidblue.wtf/t/Adobe-Indesign/][InDesign]] -- a learning
experience which I will surely at least attempt to thoroughly document,
here.

** Digital Gardening
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: section0098.xhtml#digital-gardening
   :END:

I think it was
[[https://tomcritchlow.com/blogchains/digital-gardens/][Tom Critchlow's
Digital Gardening blogchain]] that first exposed me to the term and
[[https://tomcritchlow.com/wiki/][his static site-generated wiki
project]] that introduced me to the concept of personal wikis, not so
long ago, though the desire to organize and/or archive
personally-relevant information through the format has actually been
rattling around my head for the better part of a decade. When I
discovered that one could install
[[https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/MediaWiki][MediaWiki]] -- the platform
Wikipedia, itself is built on -- I created the shortlived /Drywall
Wiki/, once upon a time. Since I last wrote you, I also purchased the
[[https://extratone.wiki/][extratone.wiki]] domain and played around
once again with the platform. Typora even offers exports in MediaWiki's
bizarre proprietary text format! For better or worse, though, I don't
see anything becoming of the project for the moment I suppose it feels
like somewhat of a risk, investing a lot of time I probably shouldn't
have into documenting all of my Twitter jokes. For the moment, I think
my Notion account will have to serve as my personal wiki.

The most inciteful argument I've read among the Digital Gardens
discourse revolves around /value/ as it is created within our personal
online writing spaces. Two of the many infinitely-quotable essays within
this space: Mike Caulfield's
“[[https://hapgood.us/2015/10/17/the-garden-and-the-stream-a-technopastoral/][The
Garden and the Stream: A Technopastoral]]” and
“[[http://snarkmarket.com/2010/4890][Stock and flow]]” from
/Snarkmarket/. The former references Vannevar Bush's infamous
“[[https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1945/07/as-we-may-think/303881/][As
We May Think]]” essay (which I've finally gotten around to finishing and
its description of a “memex,” which many cite as a disturbingly-apt
prediction of the World Wide Web. Caulfield, however, disagrees:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  So most people say this is the original vision of the web. And
  certainly it was the inspiration of those pioneers of hypertext. But
  in reality it doesn't predict the web at all . Not at all. The web
  works very little like this. It's weird, because in our minds the web
  still works like this, but it's a fiction.
#+END_QUOTE

Reading back from a lens including this commentary, I immediately
understood. The /memex/ concept is far more intimate than the web has
become (or perhaps ever was -- I wouldn't know.) “Stock and flow”
defines creative value in two disparate types of media:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Flow* is the feed. It's the posts and the tweets. It's the stream of
  daily and sub-daily updates that reminds people you exist.

  *Stock* is the durable stuff. It's the content you produce that's as
  interesting in two months (or two years) as it is today. It's what
  people discover via search. It's what spreads slowly but surely,
  building fans over time.
#+END_QUOTE

To be honest, I personally cannot imagine undertaking the task of
explaining this differentiation to /anyone/ in my own life, but if the
reactionary movement within The Web back to a focus on /valuable/
content is, indeed, underway, perhaps such conversations are bound to
shortly become more and more natural. For my part, I have attempted
setting up an experimental site on Github Pages using Jekyll in the past
few days with partial success: as soon as I tried to specify a custom
theme, I apparently broke it, at which point I realized that I had
homework to do. As much as I hate to admit it,
[[https://kevq.uk/static-site-generators-revisited/][Kev Quirk's posts
regarding WordPress' /practical/ simplicity over SSGs]] earlier this
monthrings somewhat true. As things currently stand, WordPress'
permeability throughout The Web is an /advantage/ for those who just
want to publish something as simply as possible. My counterargument to
both Kev and myself: *[[https://write.as/][Writeas]] is a wonderful
compromise* in terms of substance and /image/ among one's super
e-enabled, Mullenweg-disgusted peers. It's very much pure Markdown, but
it's far more accessible, cross-platform, than SSGs due to its shear
simplicity.

One component which Digital Gardening would seem to offer others that I
have never particularly struggled with is the freedom to write whatever
I feel like writing. If anything, I have struggled in the opposite
sense, existing in a state /completely unhindered/ by consideration of
the value my work may or may not offer anyone else. Perhaps the most
substantial addition I'm capable of making to the Digital Gardens
conversation, then, is best quoted from the first chapter of the advice
book I have finally begun writing for young men,
/[[https://www.davidblue.wtf/writing/projects/piss/][For God's Sake,
Just Sit Down to Piss]]/:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  If there is one idea of mine you ever engage with -- in this book or
  otherwise -- it is best distilled in this single sentence: *you do not
  *actually* want to attain a state of true apathy*, trust me. It is
  extremely unhealthy, miserable, and alienating. I have existed for an
  excruciatingly long time trapped in a state of being truly unable to
  care about anything in the face of a great, varying effort to do so.
  It is very far from the immunity imbued in terms like /carefree/ -- in
  reality, it is manifested in extreme depression. It is less /immunity/
  than it is /distance/ from an essential part of life.
#+END_QUOTE

In terms of one's blogging, I am glad for those who will/have/are
finding a new freedom of expression, but hold this as a serious caution
regarding the /other/ extreme. Should you ever approach it, remember
that /considering one's audience/ -- as academics love to prioritize --
really /is/ important, eventually.

** Curation

At this point, I've used [[https://bit.ly/extratone][a channel in
/Extratone/'s Discord]] as my ongoing reading list for several years
essentially without change. Earlier this month, though, I discovered
Raindrop -- a bookmarking service with public collections that (so fars)
feels much more aligned with my own needs than Pocket -- and pretty much
immediately signed up to begin paying for it and set up a bot to
crosspost from [[https://raindrop.io/collection/13380406][my new Reading
List collection]], there to the same Discord channel via
[[https://raindrop.io/collection/13380406/feed][the collection's RSS
feed]]. Raindrop's browser extension -- along with Notion's, come to
mention it -- is /actually usable/ in day-to-day browsing. As much as I
love [[https://www.reading.am/davidblue][Reading.am]], the prospect of
its longevity worries me considering the most recent post in its
[[https://writing.reading.am/][development blog]] dates to 2016. Writing
a dedicated “[[https://www.davidblue.wtf/c/software/little/][Little

moment, I would especially emphasize my
[[https://raindrop.io/collection/13419360][Digital Magazine

exploration and genuinely worth significant value for most anyone, I
think.

With the combination of my public Notion workspaces and public Raindrop
collections, I hope to make my curatorial endeavors both more accessibly
beautiful and more intimately available. In terms of a dedicated
discussion of Notion's interworkings and culture, I think I have quite a
bit more exploring to experience before I'm sufficiently qualified,
though my notes are already quite extensive (and
[[https://www.notion.so/rotund/Little-Review-Notes-228e10a1d3fe453fac69c9244a24ee3a][publicly
accessible]], thanks to... Notion!) In general, I continue to be
astounded by the amount of tools/services/applications I /have not yet/
heard of, despite how long I have labored to become an authority on
Writing Tools.

** Workflow
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: section0098.xhtml#workflow
   :END:

In my endeavor to more intentionally design my workspace -- to actually
dedicate a space for working, originally -- I originally very much
intended to set up dual displays for my desktop, but the desk I settled
for (an old family piece from the early 1900s?) does /not/ have enough
surface area to position two displays, regardless of how thin they've
become since I last had one. Combined with a limited budget and a
concern that two displays might actually result in /further/ distraction
instead of less, I instead went for a single, 27” LED affair. I've also
been making full use of
[[https://www.cnet.com/how-to/how-to-use-multiple-desktops-in-windows-10/][Windows
10's desktop switching feature]] and have found it surprisingly easy to
make a habit, especially thanks to the *Ctrl+Win+Lateral Arrow Keys*
keyboard shortcuts.

[[file:xhtml/https:/i.snap.as/lEx7zen.png]]

On the subject of keyboard shortcuts, I've by now worked out a
personally-optimized remap (thanks to the keyboard manager tool included
with [[https://github.com/microsoft/PowerToys][PowerToys]], about which
I have /far too much/ to say in some future post.) I had
[[https://mastodon.social/web/statuses/104843391967830863][a
conversation with a few Mastodon friends]] two weeks ago convincing me
that my methodology of forcing myself to learn shortcuts by integrating
a cheat sheet into my desktop backgrounds may actually be an /original
idea/ and useful to other users.

In terms of writing spaces, I have actually been composing the less
serious stuff I've been writing within WordPress' Gutenberg editor,
which is /not/ an admission I would've expected to be making, just a
year ago. A dedicated post about this, too, is /fucking coming/, but
suffice it to say that with a fairly-substantial PC and a better hosting
provider (DreamHost over GoDaddy, in this case,) composition has become
/far far/ smoother -- improving enough to make it a viable space within
which to pound away original stuff for the first time. Writing essays
for academia has encouraged my return to Microsoft Word, once again, on
which I'll blame the fact that I am currently composing this very bit in
The Old Bitch. A desire to once again hack together a set of
personalized Word templates has led to the birth of two such files which
I am proud enough to
[[https://www.notion.so/rotund/Configuration-2efccc31e19540c294b2bc5b7cfa4863][share
on my Notion drive]]. Eventually, I would also like to take the time to
completely redesign the “Ribbon” in Word -- something which I've
literally never seen anyone else do. (I spent a substantial amount of
time trying to find a library for MS Office customization files, to no
avail, though you can find my own customization file as it stands on the
same Notion page linked just now. Let me know if you're able to
successfully import it.)

[[file:xhtml/https:/i.snap.as/gsVHo1z.png]]

A confession of vanity: I suspect the only reason I haven't yet stopped
composing within WordPress is that I figured out how to change the
typeface to Adobe Caslon (across both the editor and the front-facing
site, naturally,) thanks to my newfound access to Adobe Typekit. Yes,
apparently I really /am/ that shallow. For those Office 365 users among
you, I /highly/ suggest you look up
[[https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/turn-off-annoying-sounds-microsoft-office-2016/][how
to enable the Classic Office sound theme]]. Unlike /Make Use Of/, I find
them both adorable and genuinely useful as auditory feedback. You may
also be interested in my discovery of
[[https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/style-guide/bias-free-communication][some
fairly-Woke additions]] to Word's autocorrect options and the
[[https://www.foxnews.com/tech/microsoft-ai-word-politically-correct][subsequent
bitchy controversy]] their introduction spawned.

If you know me at all, the following admission probably seems
unbelievable: I have been /using Reddit/. I created a
[[https://www.reddit.com/r/extratown/][new subreddit for /Extratone/]]
-- which I do not necessarily expect to be populated any time soon --
and [[https://www.reddit.com/r/softwarehistory][r/SoftwareHistory]]
after discovering that it didn't yet exist, which I /definitely/ do not
expect you to populate, but would be delighted if you did. As with
seemingly everything else I've covered, I /also/ intend to write about
how Reddit's recent feature additions and redesign may /actually/ make
it a redeemable space on The Web, which should prove interesting.
Clearly, I have become more than willing to accept the moniker of
/Software Historian/ whenever/if ever my authority achieves the
appropriate volume to deserve to be christened so.

Obviously, none of the developments I've shared in this post indicate
any improvement in my productive output, but I hope to learn soon how to
settle into a fairly-consistent (and hopefully much more original)
writing process.

/Listen to this article read by Siri Voice 2 below.../

For those of us who've written about technology, generally, for quite a
long time, any injection of the broader metaphysical/“ethical”
conversation regarding the impact the industry has had/is having/is
expected to have on our species into popular culture is inevitably an
emotional event. /The Social Network/ had an almost comical disregard
for any potential function as a substantial critique of its subjects.
Not that it's particularly supportive of that argument, but Mark Fuck,
himself, recently
[[https://www.businessinsider.com/mark-zuckerberg-mentions-the-social-network-during-testimony-2018-4][said
in court]], essentially, that he didn't know what the movie was about.
I'm not particularly sure, either. I suppose the dramatic film industry
has no particular obligation to be critical of /the times/, but
/documentaries/ certainly should, in my estimation, and /The Social
Dilemma/ could've done better, in that regard.

First, the *actively misleading*: As thoroughly as I enjoyed Peter
Campbell's casting as the master-manipulating triplets behind the
dramatized young man's screen, the film's depiction of this very human
invasion of privacy is /blatantly false/ imagery. The Privacy Problem is
/not/ that Facebook or Google employees are directly and actively
viewing and manipulating your use of their services in real time. In
fact, it is /ridiculously/ unlikely that human eyes will ever see your

  The dramatized segments include a fictional trio of sociopaths working
  inside an unnamed social network to design bespoke push notifications
  to distract their users. They show an anguished family struggling to
  get the children to put their phones away during dinner. And the
  ominous piano score that pervades every scene, rather than ratcheting
  up the tension, gives it all the feeling of camp.

[[https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/4/21419993/the-social-dilemma-jeff-orlowski-netflix-movie-review-social-media-algorithms][/The
Verge/'s official review of the film]] -- written by Adi Robinson and as
cited by Casey -- is an important read, as well. Robinson makes use of
some very intelligent language and cites some very interesting bits
(including a Wikipedia article about a series of Hogarth paintings?) for
/The Verge/'s audience, who already knew all of this. What I hoped to do
by writing about this at all was speak to those distinctly /separate/
tech media -- grandmothers, retirees, etc. -- who are both directly
affected by the subjects covered by /The Social Dilemma/ and
particularly susceptible to its delusions about “privacy” -- a term
which I would argue is not particularly relevant to the conversation.
Personally, I define my privacy in a way that is not violated by the
simple *collection* of “my data,” regardless of how detailed said
collection may or may not be, but would be by individual *examination*
with human eyes, which -- while possible -- is extremely unlikely if for
no other reason than a lack of business incentive. While Google may have
access to the data it would need to determine whether I am currently
showering or not, there is absolutely zero monetary gain to be had in
one of its employees (or outsourced contractors) knowing this.

Now, on to the *notably missing*: Perhaps most important to note before
I go on is that the film was produced by -- and directly promotes on
several occasions -- one particular organization, called the
[[https://www.humanetech.com/][/Center for Humane Technology/]], which
notably has a .com rather than a .org domain... hm. Immediately after
watching the film, I complied with its direction to its website, where I
was specifically looking for “solutions” to the issues it presented.
Aside from Wikipedia (sortof,) it neglected to mention the abundance of
alternative organizations and projects who've been building against the
adtech-funded web for ages -- some for decades. Unfortunately, neither
the organization's website nor the film's webpage list any of these
alternatives, whatsoever, which personally leads me to believe *the
whole thing is bullshit*, for lack of a better term.

[[file:xhtml/https:/i.snap.as/6k9MzeE.png]]

The film essentially argues for a single choice: using social media and
other adtech-sustained services, or /not/ using them. What I'm here to
tell you: *you have a choice of services*. For every single individual
service criticized in the film, I guarantee there exists at least a
handful of alternatives across a spectrum of sin. If you've followed my
work for any length of time (you probably shouldn't still be reading,)
you know I've advocated exhaustively for
[[https://joinmastodon.org/][Mastodon]] -- the open web, decentralized
social network outpacing Twitter in every single way. Two years ago, I
spent [[https://bilge.world/bandcamp-streaming-music][an entire summer]]
arguing that Bandcamp is the only music streaming service who's business
model benefits both platform and artist. I'm still finishing up
[[https://www.notion.so/rotund/David-Blue-vs-Big-Blue-9d82a679c93a41d78c6736e8a61e30e0][a
massive essay that discusses alternatives to Facebook]], which has been
an exhausting but educational journey, as you can probably imagine,
namely that leaving a platform as all-consuming as Facebook for an
open-source and/or federated alternative requires a certain amount of
bravery. Essentially, the evidence suggests that the /alternatives/
discussion is a particularly important one to me, as is finding a way to
evangelize it that isn't immediately off-putting to “the average
person.”

Poke around the film's official website a bit and you'll discover a
variety of heavily-branded “resources” for “taking action,” all awash
with a certain irony, including
[[https://drive.google.com/file/d/1juAZCcmRpNNjXajXnm0KOS-9fFUhPI3q/view][a
fucking Bingo game]] (hosted on Google Drive, no less,) which the site
/actually/ suggests you post on your Instagram story! Also under the
“Take Action” vertical are links to Moment CEO Tim Kendall's
[[https://www.thesocialdilemma.com/reclaim-your-screen-time/][tips for
reducing your screen time]], the
“[[https://datadetoxkit.org/en/home/][Data Detox Kit]],” which advocates
for Firefox as the private browsing solution (among an indigestibly huge
link tree,) a “Join Now” button, and -- most ironic of all -- a link to
download the “[[https://adobserver.org/][Ad Observer plugin]],” in order
to “share with researchers the ads you see on social media as they work
to expose micro-targeting techniques & hold political advertisers
accountable.” In other words, the very same data collection the film
condemns, albeit for the “Online Political Transparency Project” instead
of the greater adtech monstrosity.

[[file:xhtml/https:/i.snap.as/gf22b9R.png]]

No, it's not a scam. Using /The Markup/'s shiny new
[[https://themarkup.org/blacklight][Blacklight tool]], I found
thesocialdilemma.com to be entirely free of any malicious tracking aside
from the inevitable accompaniment to their Google Drive embeds. (Here's
[[https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/893e4684-462b-4548-92ad-b85f240d0e85/report.html?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=AKIAT73L2G45O3KS52Y5%2F20201001%2Fus-west-2%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20201001T204417Z&X-Amz-Expires=86400&X-Amz-Signature=98001ad78557d11b12dda1347cb193c252f54a81b00547970717080c06bf04eb&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&response-content-disposition=filename+%3D%22report.html%22][the
report in full]].) All at once, we can be virtually certain there is no
/malice/ in this particular destination, at least, which leaves...
incompetence? I'm afraid so. It is not revolutionary to suppose that the
people who conceived of these ruthlessly effective systems of adtech and
figure out how to implement them in the real world -- regardless of what
they believe now, or then -- that these folks should not be our first
call when we're searching for “solutions.” You know this, they know it,
and they /explicitly acknowledged it/ at least twice in the film,
itself, and yet the fact of it remains.

Would you care to guess what
[[https://datadetoxkit.org/en/privacy/essentials/#step-1][Chapter 1]] of
the [[https://datadetoxkit.org/][/Digital Detox Kit/]] is about? I can't
imagine you'd be correct... Under the heading “CONTROL YOUR SMARTPHONE
DATA,” step 1 is literally just /renaming your phone/:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  At some point, you may have “named” your phone for /Wi-Fi, Bluetooth/
  or both -- or maybe the name was automatically generated during setup.

  This means that /“Alex Chung's Phone”/ is what's visible to the Wi-Fi
  network owner and, if your Bluetooth is turned on, to everyone in the
  area who has their Bluetooth on as well.

  You wouldn't announce your name as you enter a café, restaurant, or
  airport, so neither should your phone.
#+END_QUOTE

Now, I've always considered the ability to change a computer's name an
immense privilege. My first “real” computer's name was Clementine, then
there was Bertha, two Sophies (probably my favorite traditionally female
name, so I excuse myself,) Silas, Linus, Uel, Jehoshaphat, Temba, Knot,
and now Hildur. My iPhone 8 Plus' name is Gravel. However, I realize
that most users could care less, and I think that's completely rational.
Technically, suggesting you change your phone's common name to that of
“your favorite television character”
([[https://fortitude.fandom.com/wiki/Hildur_Odegard][Hildur Odegard]] is
my favorite character in /Fortitude/, so...) is /not/ bad advice, even
within its own privacy-centered argument, it's just that it's
/ridiculously/ low priority (or should be) compared with doing just
about anything else along this vein. A conundrum is presented: I cannot
imagine these people sitting down and seriously jotting down “change
device name” as step 1 in their strategy, but I also cannot fathom an
incentive for them to expend such effort facetiously or maliciously.
Again, incompetence/ignorance is the only remaining explanation.

[[file:xhtml/https:/i.snap.as/sEa9ojU.jpeg]] /A notification I received
while literally typing this out./

I have to backtrack, now, and confess that I /did/ find an
“[[https://datadetoxkit.org/en/alternative-app-centre/][Alternative Apps
Centre]]” within the Data Detox Kit, which contains some genuinely smart
recommendations like ProtonMail, Riot, Signal, and DuckDuckGo
surrounding a bunch of privacy-enhancing browser extensions. However,
the “detox” seems to have been lost at some point along the way. No
amount of privacy (yes, I do think it's hilarious that I can freely
refer to “privacy” as a commodity with a positive quantity) can detoxify
one' social media addiction. The savvy reader notes the “Supported by
Mozilla Firefox” badges all over the website and asks me “well, what did
you expect?” My answer: something “more” than promotion, I suppose.

I suspect this is another case of /don't go to those who created the
problem for the solution/. /More privacy/ is a more tangible vector upon
which to “innovate” than simply /putting down the fucking phone/, but
the interviewees in the film at least touched upon a very important
insight in that regard: *turn off all your notifications*. I genuinely
believe turning off /all/ notifications is a good way to proceed,
especially if this film (or anything else, for that matter) has made you
feel uncomfortable about your relationship with your phone. I realized
that I'd somehow allowed YouTube to clutter my notifications
unconsciously for /years/, which is disturbing. In general, the apps
who's notifications I'd probably value the most (Bandcamp!) are the ones
who use the feature the least/the most subtly.

Leaving your phone in a different room while you sleep is a good idea,
though it seems a bit excessive when you could just *turn it off*,
instead. (Displaced from your bed or stone dead, your chances of making
use of your handset in an emergency are about the same, I'd wager.) I
suspect it's long overdue for a reboot, anyway. As far as “*Email
Addiction*” goes, I suggest you first take an afternoon to go through
your inbox and make use of GDPR's greatest gift: the single-click
opt-out, most often found in very small text in a given email's footer.
If you're /really/ serious, unsubscribe from even the newsletters you
/do/ read and make yourself resubscribe to them. Make use of your
preferred email platform's archives feature -- or don't -- but clear
everything from your inbox itself. Mark it all as read. Then, you'll be
ready to seek out other /Email Wellness/ methodologies like the
recently-trendy /Inbox Zero/.

If quitting social media cold turkey is not viable in your personal or
professional life, *a set daily time* to check your notifications is a
very good start. Yes, it's okay to announce on Facebook that you're
taking a break from Facebook. There /is/ a very good reason:
accountability, to both yourself and your friends. If you are interested
in the alternatives I mentioned before, genuinely *contact me literally
any time*. My personal phone number is *(573) 823-4380*. I would be
elated to discuss some of the services I've discovered with you.

My own advice on “privacy:” don't worry about installing browser
extensions, or using a different browser for that matter. Aside from a
password manager, there is no need to download or install any additional
software to protect your information. All the “privacy tools” you need
are already present on your device, and they mostly consist of
geolocation settings. If you're an iOS user, you've already been
confronted with them in the past few months. If you are still genuinely
bothered by automated data collection unseen by human eyes, your only
next step -- if we're really honest with ourselves -- is figuring out
how you're going to go without the internet. Untracked browsing is no
longer a realistic option.

I've never been a big fan of holidays, nor do I think Thanksgiving
should be a federal one, given its shitty, undebatably imperialist
origins, but these opinions are entirely inconsequential. Regardless of
how I feel, Thanksgiving will remain as pervasive as ever in the spaces
around me, so I thought I'd change things up this year and /actually
participate/ in a substantial way. I did my best to travel back to a
vastly less complicated self, letting all of the crud that's accumulated
atop my love of computers in the past twenty years: wokeness, adtech,
Obama wearing VR glasses, etc... When I thought the Native Americans
were /glad/ to see white people because they gave them guns and horses
and assumed people made things because good ideas were the apex of
currency. When I was able to respond to new software discoveries by
screwing around aimlessly without wondering if they'd been stolen
entirely from a handful of talented developers lacking in the resources
and know how required to protect their ideas in the face of Microsoft's
ruthless /Embrace, Extend, Extinguish/ crusade.

Forgive yourself for a moment and return there with me. Or perhaps
somewhere else, if you need -- wherever and whenever you last remember
feeling genuinely enthralled with /The Future of Computers/. (Perhaps it
was yesterday! If so, Gourd bless you. Never change.) Let's take
ourselves back to kindergarten, before we knew anything about the rapid
cyclical consolidation and monopolization within the technology industry
that had already established itself as a trend, by then, when all we
knew of the software we interacted with was contained within our most
visceral reactions: /I like Ask Jeeves because I like red and I like
Jeeves./ I vaguely remember when Google (the search engine) first
broached the general awareness of my elementary school's computer lab.
I'm fairly sure I even remember the sort of feelings that were elicited
the first time I actually set eyes on the Google.com homepage: it looked
so modern, then, compared to the rest of the web. (After two decades, it
currently looks like shit.) Upon the first first query, it was
immediately clear that Google was superior to any of the other search
engines we'd been using.

This sort of encounter -- with a service that significantly alters one's
perception of a given set of tasks -- is precious in our lives as users.

A few examples from my own using life which come to mind:

- The first time I witnessed a Skype call.
- Downloading and using the beta Evernote client on the school machines
  in Junior High.
- The first album I uploaded on Bandcamp.
- Discord's first public release.
- The “moment” I first put a name to Markdown. (I'd been using bits of
  the syntax for years before I actually read the word.)
- And most recently, exploring Notion as personal catch-all
  documentation software.

The atmosphere of elation about the future on which I so often lament
has been replaced by wariness for most of us -- from Californian
software developers to tractor-hacking farmers. Now, the conversation is
saturated with CEO appearances before legal committees, corporate memo
leaks, and somber interviews. Of course, I have unquestionably
contributed /more/ than my share. In fact, I wish I could be twice as
critical in twice the written volume, and
[[https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/1329078973691695117][I believe]]
the tech media industry to be far too culturally-embedded within Silicon
Valley to be nearly critical enough. For this holiday, though, I think a
respite from the negative is worthwhile and essential. I know it is for
/my/ personal sanity, at least.

submitted this one (thank you, human!,) and end up missing out on an

a very much analog fashion through Lutheran school, I wonder in
retrospect how software solutions could've changed the experience.

Shortly after I discovered NeoCities last Spring, I signed up to be a
[[https://neocities.org/supporter][Supporter]] for $5/month, not
necessarily for the additional storage or bandwidth, but because the
project immediately sounded like one I was personally obligated to
uplift. Parimal Satyal's essay
“[[https://neustadt.fr/essays/the-small-web/][Rediscovering the Small
Web]],” along with the design of the website which delivered it,
inspired me to make another attempt at building an HTML site by hand. So
far, [[https://davidblue.xyz/][davidblue.xyz]] obviously borrows
/heavily/ from his CSS, but looking at the code itself was vastly more
pleasant than one would expect. Recently, during the course of writing
an [[https://github.com/extratone/bigblue][academic research essay]], I
found myself listening to
[[https://www.softwaresessions.com/episodes/bringing-geocities-back-with-kyle-drake/][interviews
with its founder, Kyle Drake]] and reading
[[https://www.wired.com/2013/07/neocities/][articles from its debut in
2013]], which prompted me to take even further advantage of my account.

Last week, I moved my inactive automotive blog
([[https://dieselgoth.com][dieselgoth.com]]) from a Writeas blog to a
purely-HTML [[https://neocities.org/site/dieselgoth][NeoCities website]]
with disturbingly little friction. (I challenge you to spot any
differences.) After discovering a backup of the original Drywall Website
deep within my old files, NeoCities was the only reasonable host on
which to [[https://iowa.neocities.org/][archive it]]. After I'd finished
uploading, I fell down what the youth call a “rabbit hole” of discovery,
mesmerized by what I found on page after page of
[[https://neocities.org/browse][NeoCities' site browser]]. I did my best
to save the best finds by
[[https://neocities.org/site/davidblue/follows][following them]] within
the sites dashboard and have since set up a
[[https://github.com/extratone/neocollect][/Best of NeoCities/ GitHub
repository]] with my absolute favorites among them archived thanks to
[[https://www.gnu.org/software/wget/][wget]].

Trust me when I tell you that *some of the best web design, /ever/ can

pleasantly surprised by strangers
[[https://neocities.org/site/davidblue?event_id=1301289][commenting on

discovered just this morning was almost immediately met with encouraging

** Reclaiming tastemaking for listeners in the Spotify era.
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: section0101.xhtml#reclaiming-tastemaking-for-listeners-in-the-spotify-era
   :END:

Last week, Spotify users were treated to the service's annual
“[[https://newsroom.spotify.com/2020-12-01/6-new-features-to-unwrap-in-your-spotify-2020-wrapped/][Spotify
Wrapped]]” feature: a visual summary of an account's listening habits
throughout the year, including their most listened-to artists. New for
2020 are “in-app quizzes,” a chronological “Story of Your 2020,” and
detailed podcast listening statistics. For premium users, “badges” will
“crown listeners with various titles based on the ways they listened.”

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  For example, if a number of your playlists gained significant new
  followers, you'll be a /Tastemaker./ If you listened to a song before
  it was cool (aka hit 50,000 streams), you'll get the /Pioneer/ badge.
  And based on the number of songs you added to playlists this year, you
  just might become a /Collector/.
#+END_QUOTE

Their use of the term /Tastemaker/ is particularly interesting.
“Tastemaking” -- a function once relegated to magazines -- has taken a
concerning bent in the Algorithmic Age. Very much contemporary terms
like “[[https://megaphone.link/VMP4291212808][filter bubble]]” and
“[[https://www.culturedmag.com/shouts-echo-chamber/][echo chamber]]” --
applied more and more often to social platforms like Facebook and
Twitter, now -- can also be associated with music streaming services
like Spotify, who's “playlistification” of content has had a number of
alarming effects on American culture.

[[file:xhtml/https:/i.snap.as/jKs57Tfw.png]]

In 2018, /The Baffler/'s Liz Pelly explored Spotify playlists' gender
bias in “[[https://thebaffler.com/latest/discover-weakly-pelly][Discover
Weekly]]:”

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  On Today's Top Hits, I found that over the course of one month, 64.5
  percent of the tracks were by men as the lead artist, with 20 percent
  by women and 15.5 percent relying on collaborations between men and
  women artists. When all features were taken into consideration, I
  found that 85.5 percent of tracks included men artists, while only
  45.5 percent included women. This was one of the highest percentages
  of women artists out of all the playlists I examined.
#+END_QUOTE

She also quotes a LinkedIn post by “Jerry Daykin, the Head of Media
Partnerships at Diageo,” in which he observes, “The most popular tracks
on Spotify get featured in more playlists and become even more popular
as a result.” In January of the same year, the online music magazine
/Pitchfork/ published an op-ed by musician Damon Krukowski entitled
“[[https://pitchfork.com/features/oped/how-to-be-a-responsible-music-fan-in-the-age-of-streaming/][How
to Be a Responsible Music Fan in the Age of Streaming]],” which provided
concrete statistics on this phenomenon (emphasis mine:)

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  According to the data trackers at
  [[http://www.buzzanglemusic.com/][BuzzAngle Music]], [on Spotify,]
  more than *99 percent of audio streaming is of the top 10 percent
  most-streamed tracks*. Which means *less than 1 percent of streams
  account for all other music*.
#+END_QUOTE

“While streaming media is pitched to us as tailored to our taste, or at
least to our browsing history,” Krukowski goes on to note, “the business
of it is in fact closer to one-size-fits-all.” Clearly, this is an
issue, but technically *only insofar as Spotify advertises itself as a
means to discover new music*, which
[[https://www.spotify.com/us/about-us/contact/][it does consistently]].

The company has faced criticism in other areas, most recently by /The
New Yorker/'s Alex Ross in a widely-read review of
“[[https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/decomposed][Decomposed: The Political
Ecology of Music]],” a new book by University of Oslo professor Kyle
Devine, entitled
“[[https://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/the-hidden-costs-of-streaming-music][The
Hidden Costs of Streaming Music]].” Ross first cites a statement by
Spotify CEO Daniel Elk, “The artists today that are making it realize
that it's about creating a continuous engagement with their fans,”
arguing the true meaning of his words to be “to make a living as a
musician, you need to claw desperately for attention at every waking
hour.” His most original (as in, yet to be considered in the mainstream
discourse) argument, though, involves the service's environmental
impact. He cites Devine's depiction of a profound cultural delusion
surrounding the consumption of music, suggesting that music is “seen as
a special pursuit that somehow transcends the conditions of its
production.”

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  In a chapter on the digital and streaming era, Devine drives home the
  point that there is no such thing as a nonmaterial way of listening to
  music: “The so-called cloud is a definitely material and mainly
  hardwired network of fiber-optic cables, servers, routers, and the
  like.” This concealment of industrial reality, behind a phantasmagoria
  of virtuality, is a sleight of hand typical of Big Tech, with its
  genius for persuading consumers never to wonder how transactions have
  become so shimmeringly effortless.
#+END_QUOTE

Also noteworthy are questions of Spotify's viability as a business,
which Ross includes by citing
[[https://www.barrons.com/articles/spotifys-losses-widen-as-subscribers-keep-growing-51596034688][a
July article in /Barrons/]] quoting Spotify Technology's second-quarter
earnings report: “The streaming music company lost $418 million, or
$2.24 per share, versus analysts' expectations for a 41-cent loss.”
Spearheading this year's news conversation surrounding the company,
though, were its widespread acquisitions in the Podcasting industry,
including
[[https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/6/18213462/spotify-podcasts-gimlet-anchor-acquisition][Anchor]],
[[https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/10/21557458/spotify-megaphone-podcast-streaming-ad-insertion][Megaphone]],
[[https://www.vox.com/2019/2/7/18214941/alex-blumberg-matt-lieber-gimlet-spotify-deal-acquisition-peter-kafka-media-podcast-audio-interview][Gimlet
Media]], and --
[[https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/25/opinion/joe-rogan-spotify-podcast.html][most
controversially]] -- the exclusive rights to the most listened-to
property in the medium,
[[https://www.theverge.com/21265005/spotify-joe-rogan-experience-podcast-deal-apple-gimlet-media-ringer][/The
Joe Rogan Experience/]]. Though details of their implications are beyond
the scope of this essay, it is reasonable to assume its concerns -- if
not its proposed solutions -- should apply to the future of podcasting
as well.

** Responsible Curation
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: section0101.xhtml#responsible-curation
   :END:

For solutions to address Spotify's overwhelming skew toward rewarding
popular music with even more popularity, we can first look within its
own history to just a few years earlier, when human curation was more
equally matched in its fight against algorithmic curation. In 2015, the
company claimed that
“[[https://pitchfork.com/features/article/9686-up-next-how-playlists-are-curating-the-future-of-music/][Half
of Spotify users stream from other users' playlists at least monthly]].”
/Pitchfork/'s Marc Hogan profiled a number of “power users” within the
upper percentile in terms of followers and personal playlist popularity.
Notably, all of his examples are male.

Generally, human curation should hypothetically combat its algorithmic
counterpart in terms of favoring already commercially successful
content, if not its gender disparity. The industry's other biggest
player, Apple Music, has invested heavily and successfully in the
former. (Disclosure: I have been an Apple Music subscriber since its
launch.) /Fast Company/ addressed this contrast in a 2018 long read
entitled
“[[https://www.fastcompany.com/90205519/spotifys-playlist-for-global-domination][Spotify's
$30 billion playlist for global domination]]:”

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  Cook's words embody Apple's longstanding critique of Spotify, which is
  that its algorithms are eroding music's spiritual role in our lives.
  Cook doesn't mention Spotify by name but says, “We worry about the
  humanity being drained out of music, about it becoming a
  bits-and-bytes kind of world instead of the art and craft.”
#+END_QUOTE

Then again, the same article also quotes Tim Cook -- the CEO of the most
valuable company in the history of the world -- as insisting “We're not
in it for the money.” In turn, Daniel Elk is quoted, saying “Music is
everything we do all day, all night, and that clarity is the difference
between the average and the really, really good,” though what exactly he
is quantifying as “really, really good” is not entirely clear. In
context, the words of both leaders seem untrustworthy -- vague, at best.

In tremendous and relevant contrast to the voices of these CEOs is that
of Ethan Diamond, CEO and co-founder of Bandcamp, a music streaming
service unlike any other. In [[https://mtflabs.net/podcast076/][an
interview with Music Tech Fest director Andrew Dubber this May]],
Diamond exemplifies an entirely different mentality in running a
for-profit service for independent music artists.

In 2007, Diamond and former colleagues Shawn Grunberger, Joe Holt, and
Neal Tucker set out to build the equivalent of blogging services like
Blogger, WordPress, MovableType, etc. for musicians. As Holt bemoaned in
[[http://htmltimes.com/band-camp.php][a 2008 interview with /The HTML
Times/]], creating an online presence for one's music had long been “a
pain in the ass:”[^1]

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  You need to find a place to host it, you've gotta get the metadata
  right, it's just hard. So we just decided we would do that hard part
  for musicians so that they didn't have to be so nerdy.
#+END_QUOTE

From its very origin, the team designed Bandcamp to make the process of
publishing one's music as easy as possible. In
[[https://blog.bandcamp.com/2008/09/16/hello-cleveland/][the first post
on the company's blog from September, 2008]], Diamond details the
results of their engineering:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  We keep your music streaming and downloading quickly and reliably,
  whether it's 3am on a Sunday, or the hour your new record drops and
  Pitchfork gives it a scathingly positive review. We make your tracks
  available in every format under the sun, so the audiophilic nerderati
  can have their FLAC and eat mp3 v2. We adorn your songs with all the
  right metadata, so they sail into iTunes with artwork, album, band and
  track names intact. We mutter the various incantations necessary to
  keep your site top-ranked in Google, so when your fans search for your
  hits, they find your music long before they find bonkersforlyrics.com
  or iMyFace. We give your fans easy ways to share your music with their
  friends, and we give you gorgeous tools that reveal exactly how your
  music is spreading, so you can fan the fire.
#+END_QUOTE

In the years since, Bandcamp has demonstrated time and time again the
sincerity in its commitment to artists through programs like “Bandcamp
Fridays,” when the service waives its cut of artists' revenue (ten
percent on physical releases, fifteen percent of digital.) In 2017, the
company
[[https://pitchfork.com/news/bandcamp-donating-proceeds-to-transgender-law-center-this-friday/][donated
a Friday's share of proceeds to the Transgender Law Center]] in response
to the Presidential Administration's proposal to ban trans people from
serving in the U.S. military. This year, throughout the Coronavirus
pandemic, the company has repeatedly
[[https://daily.bandcamp.com/features/bandcamp-covid-19-fundraiser][brought
back the program]] in recognition of its impact on independent artists,
and the results have been profound. On March 20th, for a specific
example, $4.3 million worth of purchases was distributed.

Unlike Spotify, Bandcamp /is/ a profitable company, and has been for
nearly a decade. In Dubber's interview, Diamond explains their financial
origins:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  In 2007/2008 we took a little bit of VC funding and then focused on
  getting to profitability. So we did that and got there in 2012, and
  that's helped us maintain the mission, maintain the vision that we've
  had for the company for a long time.
#+END_QUOTE

Also in contrast to Spotify, Bandcamp explicitly invests in less
popular, fringe content, through its online publication the
[[https://daily.bandcamp.com][/Bandcamp Daily/]]:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  The mission of the Daily, it's our editorial arm, and it's just to
  highlight this incredibly diverse world of music that's on a site
  where anybody can upload anything. And the result of that is that you
  have weird subgenres and a lot of music, I think, that wouldn't
  necessarily be covered anywhere else.
#+END_QUOTE

Bandcamp has long demonstrated an anthesis to the business models
technology companies have been so criticized for upholding and has done
so in relative obscurity from the media. In his interview, Dubber asks
Diamond one of the primary questions prompting the creation of this
essay: “how come Bandcamp doesn't get mentioned in all these press
articles about music services?” In answer, Diamond offers his own
business decisions out of “[his] personal preference:”

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  I like the idea that Bandcamp hangs out in the background and just
  makes all of this stuff work, and also, hopefully, helps the artist
  promote themselves, and it's not about “Bandcamp, Bandcamp,
  Bandcamp.”[^2]
#+END_QUOTE

As a /Tastemaking/ enterprise, Bandcamp has combined magazine-style
editorial publishing with user-created content in the form of
Collections -- which allow listeners to display music they've purchased
on a customizable web page -- and Artist Recommendations, which extend
from a creator's Collection to those who follow them. This system has
demonstrably lead to community and cultural wellness by genre via
responsible commentary and selection from curating creators with
authority, while still profiting its parent company tremendously.
Bandcamp has grown from four to seventy employees in its 13-year
lifespan, [[https://bandcamp.com/about][while helping artists earn $634
million]] as of December 2020. In the music industry, it is
unquestionably an outlier. Diamond inadvertently explains Bandcamp's
success in response to a question from Dubber on the company's
comparatively slow pace in terms of technological features (emphasis
mine:)

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  Deciding what to work on next, that has always felt like the easiest
  part of the job because it's whatever benefits artists the most.
  Because *the way Bandcamp makes money is if artists make a lot more
  money*, so that's what we try to spend every day doing.
#+END_QUOTE

The solution to the “debacle” of streaming music, then, is not
necessarily charity or socioeconomic revolution. It would seem that all
it takes is a sincere investment in the real people who create music.

--------------

[1] While Bandcamp set out from the beginning to make it easier for
artists to publish music, getting music on Spotify has always been a
grueling process.

[2] I fully intended to quote Kaitlyn Tiffany on how organizations
/only/ get tech media attention if a significant amount of capital is
involved in some form, but I haven't been able to find it. I'll
certainly come back and add it if/when I do.

The general, distinctly 21st-century wisdom regarding one's content
popularity seems to be something like /you never know what's going to

in my writing life after posting
“[[https://bilge.world/google-page-experience][Google Is Not God of The

right before going out-of-touch for some 13 straight hours amidst a
local BLM protest. I did not intend to write a baity title, nor did I
expect anything to come of sharing it, there -- I only did so simply
because the thought crossed my mind. Honestly, it is probably the
least-considered content I'd ever published on /The Psalms/ -- I only
put it up when I did because I knew /all/ of my energy was about to be
absorbed for an entire weekend or more. I only started the thing because
I felt it important to raise a small voice in reminder that tech media
had started using language when discussing code/online development which

In retrospect, it really is bonkers that I was excited about yet another
vague promise to /re-imagine email/ in the days surrounding
[[https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/15/21286466/hey-email-basecamp-price-availability-platforms-launch][the
launch of Basecamp's HEY]], but I feel it's important to nurture what
paltry genuine enthusiasm remains about technology and the future, so I
decided to respond to the service's homepage prompt, asking interested
visitors to write in with their own thoughts on email. I spent a morning
clacking out “[[https://bilge.world/hey-email-history][Email and I: An
Abridged History]],” which I hope will one day serve as a
part-foundation for a thorough, composed extension to my
[[https://gist.github.com/extratone/91ebe16b0c620f309e70b40f5d4dcd9e][/Why
I Write About Technology/]] series. This would be /The Psalms/ last
relevant work for a few months, while I played around with
[[https://www.davidblue.wtf/wordpress-experimentation/][an experimental

[[https://www.davidblue.wtf/college-return/][/fuckin' school/]] for the
first time in seven years.

** Fall
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: section0102.xhtml#fall
   :END:

I returned in late September with a partial recount of what I'd
discovered: “[[https://bilge.world/digital-excess][Indulging Once More
in Digital Excess]].” After exploring the concept of
[[https://tomcritchlow.com/blogchains/digital-gardens/][/Digital
Gardens/]], buying [[https://www.davidblue.wtf/hp-envy-desktop/][my
first pro-ready desktop PC]] in 10 years, playing with Big Boy Adobe
software for the first time, and reading
[[https://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674417076][a
delightful book]] documenting the history of word processing, I arrived
upon the term /Software Historian/ with which to partially describe
myself. It doesn't mean all that much at the moment, but will no doubt
be explored imminently on this Web Site.

Addressing “[[https://bilge.world/the-social-dilemma][The Social
Dilemma's Dilemma]]” and “[[https://bilge.world/big-thank][Software
Thanksgiving]]” in detail would be awfully redundant, but I would at
least note how they represent diametrically opposed perspectives through
which to discuss this stuff. Going forward into 2021, I think it's
important that I hold short on the progress I've made in moderating my
voice since 2018. /Digestibility/ is not a virtue I am at all interested
in, nor is it an appropriate one in which to invest any more effort. Any
non-/radical/ argument will inevitably prove enormously unoriginal,
which makes for a huge waste of all our time. For the moment, that's all
the editorializing I've done.

** Three Point Oh
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: section0102.xhtml#three-point-oh
   :END:

Somewhere along the research process for one of my school essays, I came
across the concept of academic
[[https://www.davidblue.wtf/git-peer-review/][revision tracking and peer
review via Git]]. Having dipped my toe back in academia, any such
circumvention of its penchant for the most archaic practices possible
was naturally intriguing. /Just wait until I show these goons how to use
hyperlinks./ Perhaps inevitably, I was launched into the Git-Gone Bender
I'm still riding simply because I finally had ample reason to actually
understand it. In just two months, I've created and forked a total of
nearly 80 repositories on [[https://github.com/extratone][my new GitHub
account]]. Though I'd created one for each of my web properties ages
ago, I had absolutely no idea how to actually make use of them, so they
were all quickly abandoned. In the past two weeks or so, I think I've
actually begun to get the hang of the system's core intricacies, best
exemplified by [[https://github.com/extratone/bilge][/The Psalms/'
Repository]] as it stands.

The “automated” [[https://github.com/extratone/bilge/projects/1][Project
Board]] I set up has so far been a very impressive replacement for the
simple todo list. It tracks and categorizes Post Ideas in their various
stages in my process: Mulling, Documentation (research,) Drafting, and
actual Publication. Technical
“[[https://github.com/extratone/bilge/issues][Issues]]” regarding the
CMS and/or the Repository, itself, have also fit in these categories
well, so far. Just today, I discovered that one can simply tag Issues by
their number to describe
[[https://github.com/extratone/bilge/commits/main][Commits]], which form
an impressive revision-tracking changelog when aggregated together. I
also figured out the general idea behind Milestones and set
[[https://github.com/extratone/bilge/milestone/1][/The Psalms/' first
one]] for my 27th birthday, next month. The goal is to have figured this
all out well enough by then that I'm no longer randomly stumbling upon
entire featuresets multiple times in a workday.
[[https://tomcritchlow.com/2020/07/23/thinking-in-public/][/Thinking in
Public/]] -- as my friend Tom Critchlow and his crowd say -- is what I'm
trying to do here, I think. Obviously, this really means that you are
more than welcome to hop the fuck in at any time, in any manner you'd
prefer. If Git is still no more than a conundrum for you -- as it was
for me just weeks ago -- I would suggest the directory for
[[https://github.com/extratone/bilge/tree/main/Drafts][In-Progress
Drafts]] as a starting point.

[[https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/1336374708753797123]]

[[https://github.com/extratone/bilge/actions][GitHub Actions]] are still
more or less a mystery to me, but I am unbothered -- /The Psalms/' seems
to be producing green text instead of red, now, in the midst of whatever
I set it up to do. I poked around the livestreams for “GitHub Universe”
a few weeks ago, when dark mode and GitHub Discussions were opened up to
more users. At the moment, I cannot imagine a single application for
forums in the context of my blog's repository, but
[[https://github.com/extratone/bilge/discussions][I turned them on,
anyway]]. It's very possible that all of the documentation-generating
functions of Git are entirely unnecessary in this case, but -- as I
entrust GitHub with the eternal task of archiving such work -- it is my
hope that it will help me add further structure to my process.

interested in GitHub related experimentation, see

has [[https://www.adobe.com/creativecloud/buy/students.html][similar
discounts]], as you're probably already aware, which have allowed me to
pursue my goal of learning InDesign. So far, I've created a sort of

discussing the current state of Adobe apps, I've realized 1) I am quite
distinct from a /professional user/, which is why I genuinely find GIMP
more useful than Photoshop, for instance, and 2) given the length of my
to-write list considering my current pace, I don't know if I'd manage to
get around to it in this lifetime.

Between now and the 11th of this month, I will be migrating worthwhile
posts from the experimental WordPress site (WTF) here and closing its
hosting account. I haven't been compelled to actually do anything with
it in months, and the handy redirects, alone, are not worth the upcosts,
however fair. Some content -- including the corresponding posts for my
Adobe experiments /will not/ be imported from WTF here. I'm also going
to rely on [[https://bit.ly/39VJ2y6][the Web Archive]] for publishing
the rest. Notable discoveries so far include
“[[https://bilge.world/iphone4-photography][Through an iPhone 4's

handset was, and a few extra-Psalms pieces of content I'd like you to
experience, like

For better or worse, all of these new exploratory avenues have so far
led directly away from the business of /actually writing/, but -- in my
best self-estimation -- I suspect I'm mostly done with fiddling, now,
and ready to start thinking on the page, again. Predictably, I've let my
upcoming [[https://github.com/extratone/bilge/issues/45][iPhone 12 Pro
Max Review]] turn into quite a monstrosity over the past two months. It
turns out, years of lapsed attention toward iOS development resulted in
my feeling more out-of-the-loop than I expected, which I was compelled
to remedy, naturally. If you're so inclined, you can follow the minutia
attached to my review process via
[[https://snap.as/extratone/iphone-12-pro-max][this dedicated Snapas
gallery]], [[https://bit.ly/12bbbp][this shared iCloud album]], my
[[http://bit.ly/psalmsyt][personal YouTube channel]] , and
[[https://bit.ly/ip12pmtw][this Twitter collection]].

[[https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/1344555610155712512]]

As per my newfound use of GitHub, I've played around with various ways
of documenting this journey, specifically. First is
[[https://github.com/extratone/bilge/wiki/David-Blue-on-iPhone-&-iOS][this
Wiki page]] (which I shall do my best to remember to keep updated)
listing the entirety of my writing history on iPhone and iOS. (It's
uh... A bit underwhelming, if I'm honest.) I've also just begun a
[[https://github.com/extratone/i][dedicated repository]] for iOS-related
documentation and resources, which will soon include a full,
sensically-indexed list of iCloud share links to my entire Siri
Shortcuts collection (I hope.) Immediately following the review, I
intend to publish here a post
[[https://github.com/extratone/bilge/issues/56][dedicated to functions
Apple has failed to properly document]], which I expect to be the most
widely-useful content on this domain. To see some of the suggestions
I've received so far and/or to add your own, see
[[https://www.reddit.com/r/ios/comments/l5p7ly/underdocumented_ios_functions_stuff_you_wish][this
mildly-successful thread]] I posted in r/iOS.

[[https://youtube.com/watch?v=uXIXjAWXVfQ]]

When I have finally tired of talking about handsets once more, I hope to
return my attention toward some other overwhelmingly-ambitious
monstrosities like my [[https://github.com/extratone/bigblue][academic
paper]] proposing federated, open-source social networks in favor of the
Big Boys, my [[https://github.com/extratone/bilge/issues/44][report]] on
the experience of returning to academia for a semester in 2020, and my
[[https://github.com/extratone/bilge/issues/12][evaluation of Notion]]
as perhaps the next Big Step in the evolution of notetaking software.
Perhaps before tackling projects the size of these, I intend to compile
another [[https://github.com/extratone/bilge/issues/28][listicle of
handy tips]] for newcomers to Writeas. As I linked before, you can now
view the entirety of /The Psalms'/ status in as much detail as you'd
like via [[https://github.com/extratone/bilge/projects/1][its Project
Board on GitHub]]. As always, you can delight me by directly engaging on
[[http://twitter.com/neoyokel][Twitter]],
[[https://mastodon.social/@DavidBlue][Mastodon]],
[[http://bit.ly/holeguest][Discord]], and/or via

/Listen to this article read by Siri below.../

Were it just I who came to you with only my voice on this cold night,
proclaiming the imminent release of a whole numerical version of a
third-party mobile Twitter client in 2021, you really would have no
choice but to send for the laws, for you'd be left no consideration
other than my comprehensive descent into absolute insanity.
[[https://bilge.world/tweetbot-5-ios-review][825 days ago]], I told you
lots about the history surrounding the development of Tweetbot 5, which
I confidently described as “likely the last com­pet­i­tive third-par­ty
Twit­ter app for iOS.” After spending the past few months diving deep
into iOS in preparation to
[[https://github.com/extratone/bilge/issues/45][review and reflect]]
upon Apple's current flagship handset, my eyes have been opened to the
exponentially-increasing pace of the whole environment's metamorphosis
during the course of my lapsed attention. In the name of progress, I've
done my best to make a point of looking back, too, yet something
astonishingly personally relevant managed to slip past me until just
last week: *there is a sixth version of the Tweetbot app*. At this
moment,
[[https://apps.apple.com/us/app/tweetbot-6-for-twitter/id1527500834][it
is listed on the App Store]] as an “Early Release” version, though its
predecessor can still be downloaded by those who've already purchased it
in the past, like me. This is an unusual practice -- usually,
pre-release versions of iOS apps can only be distributed through Apple's
developer beta testing infrastructure, though Testflight. Notably,
Tweetbot developer company Tapbots was
[[https://twitter.com/tapbot_paul/status/1354145779494100992?s=21][apparently
required]] to take down Tweetbot 5's store listing 30 days before
releasing Tweetbot 6.

[[https://soundcloud.com/compaqclub/macstories-on-tweetbot-6]]

I can't remember exactly why -- though I suspect I was just fucking
around on my phone before bed, bleary-eyed -- but the implications of
this next numeral passed me by the first time I saw and downloaded
Tweetbot 6, two weeks ago. Perhaps it's because the app didn't appear to
have any new features -- in fact, it's technically got /less/ than 5,
though those that have been removed -- user-specified URL shortening,
image hosting, and video hosting services -- haven't worked in a good
while anyway. As my old fav, /The Verge/ noted in
[[https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/26/22250899/tweetbot-6-tapbots-ios-app-update-subscription-service-twitter-api][their
coverage of 6]], blame for these omissions rests solely on Twitter,
Inc., itself, who's continued to hold its API development inordinately
close-to-chest. I didn't bother to find out about this, though, because
my first assumptions upon poking around the new app -- especially after
encountering its new subscription requirement in order to use any of its
substantive features -- was that its developers had ceased any actual
time investment into the app long ago, and that 6 was a new version in
number and rudimentary visual updates, only, shoved out in hopes of
peaking old, loyal users like myself enough to get us to download it, at
least. In the disappointment I'd already expected, I closed and
immediately deleted the app.

I've paused everything else to write you on this, though, because the
story is actually much bigger. Had I investigated any further that first
time, I would have discovered an odd amount of buzz coming from even the
most mainstream of tech media in a simple search. (Yes, I am ashamed
about it.) You're still reading, but perhaps -- as I was, originally --
you are doing so from an appropriately-jaded, well-read perspective on
software, generally, in 2021. Perhaps you're looking at the search
results, yourself, and wondering if you're dreaming. /Dedicated coverage
of a fucking third-party Twitter client iteration??? At this point in
history? What in fuck?/ I'm fairly certainly neither of us are, though:
fucking Tweetbot made headlines on
[[https://www.engadget.com/tweebot-6-tapbots-twitter-app-subscription-model-launch-110526052.html][Engadget]],
[[https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/26/tweetbot-6-released-with-new-subscription-pricing/][TechCrunch]],

and
[[https://github.com/extratone/bilge/blob/main/docs/tb6links.md][others]].
No, it's not 2010 again. In fact, /The Verge/, at least, has never given
up on Tweetbot. If my long term memory had been functioning, I would
have remembered noticing its spot in
“[[https://www.theverge.com/platform/amp/22187376/best-iphone-apps-2020-apple-ios][12
great apps for your new iPhone in 2020]]:”

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  Twitter is a vaguely terrible way to spend your time these days, but
  if you (like me) can't tear yourself away from the social media
  service / entryway into hell, you'll want Tweetbot, which actually
  makes using Twitter far less painful. Tweetbot shows you the tweets of
  the people you follow, in the order that they tweeted them. There are
  no ads or promoted tweets, powerful mute filters to block out unwanted
  noise, and (thanks to Twitter's unfriendly API changes) no
  notifications to constantly ping you to come back to the app.
#+END_QUOTE

Here's to Chaim for exposing me to a perspective I never would have
otherwise considered: Tweetbot's lack of push notifications as a
/positive/. If you're wondering, no, this new app does not ~yet~ include
any additional notification integration, and it's not clear whether or
not it's on Tapbots future roadmap for the app, or where. As for the
reality of integrating Tweetbot 6 into your current Twitter use, I stand
by my argument that deleting the native Twitter app isn't really an
option if you plan to ever view your notifications on your phone. The
popular assumption (I assume) if you're still reading is that you are a
“poweruser,” meaning details about my own configuration are probably
irrelevant. If by chance you've just downloaded Tweetbot for the first
time, you should take the time to disable notifications for Tweetbot
entirely, but leave them on for the native Twitter app, even if you
decide to banish it to your App Library. Before I began any work on this
review, I made sure to swap in Tweetbot 6 where the native app had been
in my dock for several years, now. I originally pushed the native app
all the way to page 6, but immediately found this extreme. Instead, I
put it in the bottom-right corner in my second screen, as you can see in
the screenshot below (which also serves as proof, if you needed it.)

[[file:xhtml/https:/i.snap.as/WMyY9kLc.png]]

I should also note how much my own engagement on Twitter has diminished
in the past 3-5 years. Not to manifest tiny violins -- in turn, my
engagement on (and investment in) [[http://bit.ly/dbmasto][Mastodon]]
has increased exponentially, and it's of a /much/ higher quality. I
bring it up for context's sake: I can afford to prioritize Tweetbot in
my Twitter use because of how few daily notifications I get -- a number
which is unusual for someone who uses Twitter as much as I do.
Inevitably, my own use is once again going to factor heavily in this
work, as is the significance of my relationship with Twitter, generally,
in my life. If you didn't already know, I've met basically all of my
friends since high school through Twitter. As of this moment, my private
“Friends” Twitter List includes 149 accounts, and I've spent more than
10 years, now, reading almost every single one of their Tweets. I have
been as critical of the service as anyone, but -- whether or not either
of us are willing to acknowledge it, wholly -- I believe the intimacy of
this arrangement to exceed that of any in-person relationship /I/ have
ever had. Reading the random thoughts of these people seconds or minutes
after they've popped into their heads for all this time has been an
experience unique to the format Twitter pioneered, if not to the
service, itself. I have no choice but to acknowledge that I am /deeply/
invested in not just Twitter, but Twitter's less-than-visible Lists
feature, emotionally and intellectually. When I hit my
[[https://twitter.com/neoyokel/status/1281646353102147584][follow
limit]], several years ago, Lists also became my single means of
acquiring new connections on the network. If it were to be removed, I
would lose this ability, entirely, as well as any reasonable means of
communicating with any of my friends.

[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO-ZSD-vymc]]

Perhaps you understand, now, why I have
[[https://bilge.world/twitter-lists][written]] and
[[https://twitter.com/i/events/996616971880882176][Tweeted]] so
extensively about Lists. You should also understand just how miraculous
the possibility of Tweetbot's new future now seems, personally, unless
you're new to all of these ideas and don't feel like reading that big
olé Tweetbot 5 review of mine (which is fine.) Before I go into the
history of Tweetbot, let me first share the single most telling feature
in Tweetbot of Tapbots' belief in using Lists and share some evidence of
/others'/ present day belief in Tweetbot. Shamefully, I've spent several
years -- tens, if not hundreds of thousands of hours -- using Lists in
Tweetbot, oblivious to its upmost Lists integration:
“[[https://tapbots.com/support/tweetbot6/tips/list.php][Use Lists as
Timeline]].” Had I actually bothered to look at the support docs at any
point, I would have discovered this long ago, which would have almost
certainly made my given year. *If you use Tweetbot and Lists, for the
love of Gourd, please take a look*. Here's what those docs currently
say, in full:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  One long time Tweetbot feature is the ability to use any of your lists
  as your main timeline. To do this, all you have to do is hold down on
  the “Timeline” label in the navigation bar (in the timeline tab) and a
  menu populated with your lists will appear. Select one and that will
  become your current timeline. You can switch to another list or back
  to your main timeline any time by performing the same action.
#+END_QUOTE

Even after reading this multiple times, it still was not obvious to me
what it was talking about, and I was unable to find precisely /zero/
visuals on The World Wide Web of this action taking place, so I recorded
and uploaded [[https://youtu.be/IO-ZSD-vymc][the video embedded above]].
Good God, how I wish I'd been a more detail-oriented young man! I'll be
privatizing my self-punishment from here on out, though, so bear with
me.

[[file:xhtml/https:/i.snap.as/oZ5u34QP.png]]

The discourse surrounding Tapbots' recent announcement has already
reached a higher decibel count than I would have ever expected, so it's
obvious there are plenty of /users/ who still
[[https://twitter.com/neoyokel/status/1064579914538602496][love
Tweetbot]], and you already know from the beforelinked stories that /The
Verge/ has also stood firmly by it as the preferred Twitter experience.
It takes a wee bit of digging, though, to discover the subtle bets on
both Tweetbots and Lists from no less than Apple, Inc., itself. In the
official Apple Shortcuts Gallery, a curated list entitled “Twitter
Better” includes
“[[https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/161bb19df7ee47fa8b31a0c0fb43307b][Open
Twitter Lists]]” at number 1. In 5th position is
“[[https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/c148d4f0dfbc45d6bf8bad6bb67d519c][Open
in Tweetbot]],” and
“[[https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/c45206139b9e47eb8de780e686350022][Open
in Twitter App]]” (3rd,) is configured /by default/ to first ask you to
choose between Tweetbot and Twitter's native app, despite its title.

[[file:xhtml/https:/i.snap.as/sZXfdk8L.png]]

As for App Store rankings, the fact that Tweetbot 5 was forcibly removed
from public listings makes it impossible to meaningfully judge recent
popularity of Tweetbot on iPhone/iPad. Its MacOS-based sibling, though
(called Tweetbot 3,) was the /second most popular/ paid app
[[https://apps.apple.com/us/app/tweetbot-3-for-twitter/id1384080005][on
the Mac App Store]] as of [[https://i.snap.as/Uq8bRMF8.png][February
6th, 2020]]. That's the day I borrowed my Mom's MacBook Pro for a short
while to check up on MacOS Big Sur, when I downloaded the current
version (3.5.2, if you wanted to know) of Tapbots' desktop Twitter
client and [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=219&v=vHDNdMux16g][messed
around with it]] enough to tell you that it's as wonderful as ever. (Had
I not switched back to Windows as my primary desktop OS a decade ago, I
would use it every single day.)

[[file:xhtml/https:/i.snap.as/1bbw5iFH.png]]

I suspect most active Twitter users in 2021 would be even more surprised
to discover Tweetbot's remaining, discreet hold on today's Twitter
experience than I was, assuming most of them joined more recently than
myself and those I regularly interact with. For the sake of this Post, I
reached out to Tapbots with an interview request about “Tweetbot's
roadmap, Apple's requirement that [they] remove 5 from the App Store 30
days beforehand, and why [they've] decided to take this (risky, imo) bet
on making our lives better,” though I don't expect a reply, which is
fine. They /did/ respond to my support request regarding hardware
keyboard shortcut support very quickly, saying they'll look into it.
(Without being verbose, I'll just tell you that if a near future update
to the app fixes the F and ⌘ + R shortcuts, I /will/ shit out my whole
ass.)

Before I dig into the controversy and hypotheticals surrounding what
Tweetbot 6 might become, let's take a moment to qualify it vs all of
one's options to interact with Twitter on iOS /currently/ (as in, Feb
11, 2021 at 19:24.) It's almost certainly premature to do so, but
skeptical readers would note, I'm sure, that its
[[https://apps.apple.com/us/app/tweetbot-6-for-twitter/id1527500834][listing
on the App Store]] is “early release” in name only, that I have just
spent money on this specific version, which should therefore render
inert the normal exceptions a review would make for beta or pre-release
software. If you've somehow come across this Post before reading
anything else about Tweetbot 6 and simply want to know *what is new* for
this version compared with 5.5.3 (its predecessor's most recent
release,) the frank answer as it stands is /not much/. Perhaps I'm doing
something wrong, here, but the
[[https://github.com/extratone/bilge/blob/main/docs/tb6links.md][YouTube
videos and tech media articles]] I could find dealing with the subject
of additions, specifically, were all either misleading, entirely wrong,
or both.

[[file:xhtml/https:/i.snap.as/7aSwOoGn.png]]

While 6 lists one more option (for a total of 9) under Themes in the
Display section of the app's Settings menu, none are substantive
variations of the same themes you're familiar with from 5. “Future
Light” is just a more turquoise variant of the “Default” blue UI theme
in 5. In fact, the singular change in the Display menu is the addition
of “San Francisco Rounded” under the Fonts selection. Below, you can see
side-by-side screenshots of the Tweet Detail view in Tweetbot 5 vs.
Tweetbot 6, with the regular SFUI font on the left and rounded variant
on the right (text size slider set to max on both apps.)

[[file:xhtml/https:/i.snap.as/I8RC6RUM.png]]

To be honest, I can't really tell the difference between the typefaces
in this view, but have used the new app enough to know I prefer the
latter. More topically exemplified in that image is Tweetbot 6's new
support for social cards, which the Tapbots boys have executed in a
startlingly beautiful way that puts Twitter to shame and makes one feel
like you've taken them for granted these past few years. Also in that
vein and more than worthy of the same accolades is Tweetbot 6's support
for Twitter polls. They've never looked so good.

[[file:xhtml/https:/i.snap.as/kCCCZzh5.png]]

Somewhat on-trend, the app also includes two new icons, but -- if we're
being 100% frank -- they're a paltry, dated-looking afterthought and
Tweetbot deserves (/needs/, even) better branding. If I were allowed a
singular compulsion to impress upon its developers, I'd make them put
out a public call for new art. I'm all but dying to see what the
community would come up with.

So, if you were wondering what the fuck Tapbots have been doing these
past 3+ years, you should now have the basal bullet points of your
answer. The Greater Truth about this gosh darned Twitter app (and why
its long-respected developers are now asking you for a whole dollar a
month,) though, requires a broader look.

For as long as I can remember, both the MacOS and iOS versions of
Tweetbot have always possessed a more-or-less undefinable (perhaps Apple
Development- specific) quality that's noticeably set them apart from
their direct competitors. I didn't fully understand why they “feel” so
much more “right” until I started making my way through this
[[https://github.com/extratone/bilge/issues/59#issuecomment-778762784][list
of all the interviews/podcast appearances]] by Tapbots' iOS code wizard,
[[https://twitter.com/tapbot_paul][Paul Haddad]], who comments in
variations the same argument for a /very/ deliberate developmental pace.
The first time, with a /MacWorld/ journalist on some steps outside WWDC
2013, I assumed he was just tossing some self-deprecation around to
casualize the interview:

/Frankly, we're slow at doing stuff./

Yes, you are, Tapbot... From a returning user's perspective, it's hard
to understand what in Gourd's name they've been doing. I listened and
read through every Tapbots interview I could find -- all but one with
Paul, who has through the years continued to come across as a sensitive,
well-read, even /wise/ professional developer with a healthy,
professional outlook on the work of his little (relatively) weathered
company and its place within the warp speed nightmare that is the mobile
software industry. I suppose I was expecting to find an explanation for
what I saw initially as a minimal regard for Tweetbot's history, in
contrast to 6's announcement. I wouldn't find it, though, because in
truth, I was sure I already knew it: Twitter made it clear over a decade
ago -- just after they'd purchased Tweetie and slapped their own name on
it -- that they had no intention of competing in the client space, so
[[https://www.macstories.net/stories/twitter-to-developers-enough-with-the-twitter-clients/][third-party
developers were no longer welcome]].

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  Developers have told us that they'd like more guidance from us about
  the best opportunities to build on Twitter. More specifically,
  developers ask us if they should build client apps that mimic or
  reproduce the mainstream Twitter consumer client experience. The
  answer is no.

  As we point out above, we need to move to a less fragmented world,
  where every user can experience Twitter in a consistent way.
#+END_QUOTE

I've spent enough time in The App Space (read: Phone Dude Hell) to
expect a lot of melodrama, largely without judgement, considering how
generally awful the big vendors have made the whole situation. The
business legality of the story was
[[https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/19/opinion/apple-app-store-hey.html][spiked
into the mainstream conversation]] last year by
[[https://reddit.com/r/extratown/comments/hbncn6/news_surrounding_hey_the_upcoming_email_service/][controversy]]
encouraged by Basecamp following some pretty toxic, retaliatory
correspondence from Apple regarding their plan to subsidize their new
email service, HEY. Frankly, I've found such stories -- about clashes
between big software companies over mediocre, uninspiring, and sometimes
just downright /bad/ software -- ridiculously exhausting and less and
less interesting, lately, as I've realized that the most innovative,
quality work I have experienced has basically all come from the tiniest
teams. The most groundbreaking projects and products I've bothered to
show and tell, here --

individual developers except for Shiny Frog's Bear. (Their team
currently numbers 16, by my count.) Each one of those hyperlinks
eventually leads to a form of my same rant: *why the fuck won't tech
media talk about genuine innovation anymore*.

As I read and listened through Tweetbot's history for this work, it
occurred to me that I might be neglecting to acknowledge an age old
divide in development philosophy across platforms. In the singular
instance both Tweetbot devs appeared together in a podcast interview --
a [[https://changelog.com/founderstalk/21][Founder's Talk episode from
10 whole years ago]] -- Paul Haddad addressed the /when is it gonna be
done/ question in a comprehensive and particularly illuminating way:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  I personally hate that question because, you know... it just will get
  done when it gets done... We're definitely slow. We go over every
  screen, every detail over and over again until we get it right. That
  takes time, which is why we don't talk about upcoming projects.
#+END_QUOTE

/Every screen, every detail, over and over again./ This sort of
deliberateness (which I have personally been working on appreciating, as
of late) is actually -- as I have come to realize -- Tweetbot's defining
feature, especially going forward. Out of all the third-party Twitter
clients to come and go, Tweetbot has been overwhelmingly singled out as
the favorite because of how aligned it is with the traditional
priorities of the Apple space: thoughtful, deeply-considered robustness.
Pardon the cliché, but it is the only one that has always felt /native/
-- as if it could have been published by Apple, itself.

The /iOS Poweruser Community/ has been “allowed” to drift away from
these principles
[[https://bilge.world/siri-shortcuts-ios12-review][since iOS 12]],
especially, and its Pandora's box-like integration of Siri Shortcuts
(Workflow, by another name.) You may or may not be aware of the
jailbreaking community's continued efforts -- /I/ was certainly
surprised to discover that the
[[https://reddit.com/r/Jailbreak][r/Jailbreak subreddit]] has nearly
600,000 subscribers, which outnumbers all but the eldest subreddits in
the Apple sphere, including [[https://reddit.com/r/ios][r/iOS]],
[[https://reddit.com/r/iOSBeta][r/iOSBeta]], and
[[https://reddit.com/r/shortcuts][r/Shortcuts]] (one of the primary hubs
for the Siri Shortcut tinkering community) by a huge margin. Since iOS
14's addition of sanctioned custom widgets, Twitter and Reddit have been
host to a fairly-steady stream of
[[https://9to5mac.com/2020/09/24/how-to-theme-ios-14-with-custom-icons-and-widgets-featuring-ayeris-video/][personalized
iOS “themes”]] representing varying degrees of tedium/obsession/madness.
One “fringe”-ish avenue I've explored quite thoroughly is the adjacent
community of public beta tests via
[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TestFlight][Testflight]], which allows
willing App Scrubs like myself to download beta/pre-release versions of
iOS apps. As of this moment, no less than 25 of the 227 apps installed
on my iPhone 12 Pro Max are Testflight beta versions (both numbers far
higher than normal because of my in-progress review.)

[[file:xhtml/https:/i.snap.as/Uw0XHU4c.jpeg]]

Essentially, it's now easier than ever to run incredibly janky software
on your iPhone or iPad, remaining well clear of a warranty violation,
yet the apps that stick out most boldly in the mind (at least for
myself) are unfailingly apart from any sort of experimentation. Bear,
for instance -- the writing app I evangelize to every iOS user and have
continued to describe as “the most beautiful piece of software I have
ever seen” -- just allowed registered beta testers access to its
in-progress
“[[https://blog.bear.app/2020/12/the-editor-2-0-alpha-test-for-ios-is-coming-soon/][Editor
2.0]]” on iOS, which Shiny Frog describes as still in its “alpha” stage,
yet even I have as yet been unable to trip it up whatsoever. This is the
league Tweetbot pioneered, in many ways. For the record, both Tweetbot 6
and Tweetbot 5 have been /demonstrably/ more reliable for me in the past
few months than Twitter's native app, which has been crashing /multiple
times per day/ on my devices for quite a while during regular use. I'm
accustomed to crashes, so I can't say with 100% confidence that Tweetbot
has /never/ crashed, but it certainly hasn't since I first downloaded 6
and began this review, despite my deliberate attempts to probe its every
possible function.

Not only is Tweetbot 6 reliable as hell -- it's also stupid frugal.
Currently, its App Store installation weighs in at 10.9 MB, while
Twitter's app is more than /ten times heavier/, at 116 MB. I realize
Sizes On Disk are further from your mind than they've ever been in this
age of outright computing gluttony and you probably couldn't care less
about [[https://bilge.world/bad-connection-insights][my personal
encounter with bandwidth famine in late
201]][[https://bilge.world/bad-connection-insights][8]]. In fact, I find
it particularly telling that Tapbots has continued to prioritize such
efficiency in their development /despite/ operating under less
financial, technical, and social pressure than ever to do so.

** Future of The Bot
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: section0103.xhtml#future-of-the-bot
   :END:

Let's say you've somehow made it this far without either satisfactorily
resolving your confusion about Tapbots' decision to implement
subscriptions, why they've decided to continue investing their time in
third-party Twitter clients, whatsoever, and/or some other App Quandary,
and you're still expecting /David Blue/ of all people to articulate some
pivotal element of this story that'll put your intellect at ease.
Perhaps you're still looking for a comprehensive picture of *what using
Tweetbot as one's main Twitter client looks like in 2021*. Let's change
it up a bit, toss in some fucking bullet points, and list a few
fundamental truths:

1. If you intend to view your Twitter notifications on iOS at any point,
   completely deleting the native Twitter app is not an option.
   (Notably, it doesn't look like this is going to change anytime soon,
   if ever.)
2. “Shopping around” for a third-party Twitter client leads the at all
   attentive user back to Tweetbot, exclusively. With the potential
   exception of Fenix, all other Twitter apps on the App Store are
   fucking bunk and will cost you as much or more as Tweetbot 6's new
   subscription.
3. If you use Twitter Lists regularly, you'd be an idiot not to start
   your Tweetbot subscription right this fucking minute.
4. All of these will probably remain true for the foreseeable future,
   unless I've totally misunderstood
   [[https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/16/twitter-introduces-a-new-fully-rebuilt-developer-api-launching-next-week/][Twitter's
   stated intentions for its API
   2.]][[https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/16/twitter-introduces-a-new-fully-rebuilt-developer-api-launching-next-week/][0]].

In the ~month since the Tweetbot 6 story first broke (a nice birthday
present!,) no less than three newish Twitter features have made the
news. Last week, it (apparently) committed to the worst possible
user-side content monetization model concept out of the dozens that have
dipped in and out of rumor for virtually the service's entire history:
“[[https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/feb/26/twitter-to-launch-paid-super-follow-function-that-lets-users-charge-for-content][Super
Follow]][[https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/feb/26/twitter-to-launch-paid-super-follow-function-that-lets-users-charge-for-content][s]]”
are slated to shade our collective experience with putrid /freemium/
concerns.
“[[https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/25/22301375/twitter-super-follows-communities-paid-followers][Communitie]][[https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/25/22301375/twitter-super-follows-communities-paid-followers][s]]”
sound in concept like a worthwhile and genuinely value-adding feature
addition for actual Twitter users, but any substantial expectations of
the company feel far too risky to invest in. All the while, Twitter
Spaces -- the audio-only Clubhouse-ish mutilation of Periscope's corpse
-- has been silently bestowed upon a secret set of @s at an achingly
slow pace. I don't know about you, but I still haven't even fully
digested fucking /Fleets/, yet.

*What does Tweetbot 6 really offer you, Twitter user, in 2021?* /Freedom
from all of that bullshit./

It's just occurred to me how much more anxious the movements of Twitter,
Inc. and Jack Dorsey's horrendous facial hair would be making me if I
had not discovered an (ironically) more stable, wholesome platform to
replace them, years ago. No, I will not discuss Mastodon beyond this
remark, but readers invested enough to get to this point who /haven't/
heard of the federated, open source social network by that name would do
well to consult [[https://joinmastodonn.org][this handy
hyperlin]][[https://joinmastodonn.org][k]]. This privilege of choice --
even if it's completely delusional -- has combined with Tapbots'
thoughtful brush up of their trustier-than-ever Tweetbot to ease my
longtime Twitter-dependent ass to a nigh-miraculous degree. /However/,
stepping back from it all, I realized Tweetbot's new life bets even
heavier on that single, defining feature which the company hardly
mentions, and could /conceivably/ restrict -- maliciously or not -- or
remove entirely without real consequences to their business or public
standing via tech media outcry. /What if Twitter killed Lists?/ We'd all
be fucked.

Upon this realization, I shot out of bed very late in a recent evening
and went straight to fucking Trello, of all places, to sift through
Twitter's public development roadmap for any official word on their
fate. I really did panic for a beat upon first reading the words
“[[https://trello.com/c/DSYUbM5D][Replacement for Lists
functionalit]][[https://trello.com/c/DSYUbM5D][y]]” before realizing the
actual intention of the card's expression in the context's syntax, which
is probably about as positive as it could possibly be: a public
suggestion that Lists will continue to be supported through 2.0, at
least. The card sits in the “Nesting” column (which I assume to be the
lowest priority group, chronologically,) right between identical cards
for
[[https://trello.com/c/qztXMWCK][Bookmark]][[https://trello.com/c/qztXMWCK][s]]

    :CUSTOM_ID: section0103.xhtml#the-grandma-s-house-method
    :END:

Writing about Tweetbot 6 has been an illuminating personal experience,
if you haven't yet caught on. The timing of its release has proved
awfully convenient, just predating the aforementioned catastrophe of
disjointed features that has descended harder than ever before on
Twitter's own app, leaving it an absolute mess. When I initiated the
symbolic swap maneuver documented at the very beginning of this review,
I assumed I was going to find Tweetbot awkward to use as my primary in
the present day, but have found the opposite to be true. The social
network Tweetbot draws from is barely recognizable as the same property
it drew upon originally, when its Lists-loving configuration was simply
one of a dozen different interpretations of how one should interact with
Twitter (by far the sharpest, I think we'd agree.) Tweetbots, in
contrast, is virtually identical in principle, though the unwavering
bearing of its development has resulted in the true definition of
/refinement./ The result is the most /beautiful/ way to use Twitter in
2021, no competition, and is also crucially the singular means of
interacting with it on one's “own terms” -- as long as yours align with
The Lists Method, that is -- in an environment that feels predictable
and fundamentally /at your control./

As much as I have [[https://youtu.be/LdBFMibyh3Y][praised the Mastodon
app Toot]][[https://youtu.be/LdBFMibyh3Y][!]] as the most innovative
social app available -- and will continue to do so until I encounter
something more original and ingenious -- it's perhaps the singular
remaining cleverly playful Tweetbots feature which first opened my
perspective to appreciate little Easter egg-like tricks. Indeed -- even
after all we've been through together these past ten years -- you can
still cycle through all of Tweetbot's visual themes by
[[https://imgur.com/gallery/A1zbhLq][two-finger swiping
verticall]][[https://imgur.com/gallery/A1zbhLq][y]] in 6. Quick Account
Switching is the other less-than-obvious swipe function of note, which
I'll rely on an embed stolen from Tapbots themselves to demonstrate:

[[https://imgur.com/gallery/oiwfBdQ]]

I don't think it should ever feel natural to speak sentimentally about
mobile apps, but Tweetbot is a worthy exception. If you glance over the
respective comments sections of the articles and YouTube videos I've
hyperlinked, you'll pick up on this phenomena of legacy Twitter users
chucking back some tragically nostalgic sentiments in response to the
reminder surfaced by the Tweetbot 6 news of just how long we've been
doing this. From my perspective, the /other/ majority sentiment found
there catalyzes the bizarre chronobending at play even further. I can't
believe how many folks continue to be flabbergasted by the idea of
/paying for software/ in 2021, but I've been literally begging Twitter
to charge me a monthly fee in exchange for some greater curative
capabilities for as long as I can remember. The whole of my gospel,
again, is that Tweetbot 6 has personally made using Twitter a little bit
better than bearable, so I have no other reasonable choice available:
I'm paying the fuck up.

   :END:

/Listen to this article read (with some bugs) by Siri Voice 3 below.../

As you may or may not be aware, I've spent all of my 2021 so far diving
real deep into iOS, considering all that has changed since “an iPod, a
phone, an internet communicator.” I've tuned in to the output of
explicitly Apple-adjacent publications both old (/MacRumors/, /Apple
Insider/, /9to5 Mac/, etc,) and new (/Apple Scoop/, /MacStories/,) which
have all metamorphosed in huge, mostly-redeemable ways just as their
primary subject has. I have my own pubescent stories of Mac occultism,
but I do not consider my relationship with the brand to be an essential
part of my identity, as so many do and have. Apple, Inc's story is
spectacular and infinitely-relevant so long as they remain “the most
valuable company in the history of the world,” as I so love to describe
them. Like many of you, I'm sure, I am often compelled to bring up the
humongous contrasts in the historical context of the company -- to
scream infinitely many variations of the observation that Apple was
basically the fucking /indie/, premium-tier consumer tech manufacturer
owned by the Creative Class for the first half+ of their existence, and
have somehow maintained that /Think Different/™ brand narrative as they
have definitively become the Big Blue of their time.

From my perspective, the responsibility for the wellbeing of this
utterly-delusional, occasionally very dangerous sentiment actually lies
fairly squarely on those of us who consider ourselves /better than all
of that/ because of our Debian workflows and their ancient command line
utilities. (For the record, this is also 100% delusional as things stand
in 2021.) One thing I think we can all acknowledge, though, is that
Apple's image has been inextricably bound with /musicmaking/,
throughout, far more than any other even remotely comparable tech
company. Naturally, the business still loves to bring this up all the
time in big, glossy gestures. The topical example of note would be the
only worthwhile content I've yet to encounter on Apple TV+:
[[https://tv.apple.com/us/movie/billie-eilish-the-worlds-a-little-blurry/umc.cmc.5waz3hfo9r1133t8arap8b6nq][/Billie
Eilish: The World's a Little Blurry/]], which documents the highlights
of the young, beloved musician's prodigious ascension. For what it's
worth, I appreciate some special insights I gained thanks to the film,
which I do not actually consider at odds with the truth of its super
on-brandness for Apple.

An interesting take I found from 2017 from a new favorite voice on the
/business/ end of tech reporting:
“[[http://thein.fo/8dba9a5022e1d273][How Music Drowns Apple's
Innovation]]” by /The Information/'s Jessica Lessin portrays Apple's
relationship with music distribution and the music industry as a sort of
compulsive distraction from its ambitions in serving video content,
namely. Lessin points out the everpresent reminders of this obsession:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  And so it is no wonder that Apple's first forays into original video
  content fall under Apple Music. It's worth noting that the first
  series the company announced---“Carpool Karaoke” is literally about
  singing; “Planet of the Apps” features rapper Will.i.am as a judge.
#+END_QUOTE

I think I can speak for the majority of my audience when I suggest that
the targets of Lessin's cynicism would be more than welcome, if they
were The Whole Truth. Indeed, the most valuable company in all of
history retaining an “emotional” attachment to the welfare of music
creators might be described as /charming/ or more. As is often the case
on /The Information/, the comments from readers often offer noteworthy
insight. In this case, Kevin Swint -- who has apparently worked as an
executive for both Apple and Samsung, according to
[[https://www.theinformation.com/contributors/458][his profile]] on /The
Information/ -- responded with an important consideration: “...it's
possible that Apple's behavior around music has more to do with the
company's overall tendency to stick with its past successes a bit too
long rather than music really being a core part of its DNA.”

In terms of business, that's all I have to contribute, and I shall do my
best not to evangelize Apple Music (or more likely, disparage Spotify as
one of the most destructive cultural forces of our time,) here. However,
I would like to respond to a particular Jimmy Iovine quote from the
original Apple Music announcement amid the
[[https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/apple-events-video/id275834665?i=1000430692668][2015
WWDC Keynote]]:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  There needs to be a place where music can be treated less like digital
  bits and more like the art it is, with a sense of respect and
  discovery... and if that place could actually accommodate and support
  the artists who make the music, not just the top-tier artists, but the
  kids in their bedrooms too, provide them all with a home and a way to
  engage with their audiences, that would be pretty great.
#+END_QUOTE

/Boy, this service Iovine describes sounds an awful lot like Bandcamp,
no?/ The suggestion that *Apple should have purchased Bandcamp* is a
very scary one, from my perspective, but I am reassured by the
likelihood that the notion did indeed occur to someone at Apple, Inc. at
some point in the past, and was quickly discarded, for whatever reason.
I promise not to mention Bandcamp again in this Post, aside from its own
two iOS apps: for
[[https://apps.apple.com/us/app/bandcamp/id706408639][listeners]] and
for
“[[https://apps.apple.com/us/app/bandcamp-for-artists-labels/id1185670538][Artists/Labels]]”
as creator/curator tools.

I'm going to be focusing largely on the iPhone-bound experience, here,
though I did borrow my mom's MacBook Pro for a weekend to explore the
state of music on MacOS and (accidentally) played around with
[[https://youtu.be/AazMEzHPN-0][Apple Music on The Television]] (a
surprisingly beautiful experience.) On that note, I'll hurry up and get
specific...

Assuming you're already an Apple Music user, it's very possible that

entries that integrate directly with Apple Music. One of the most
glaring discoveries I've made so far in my iOS deep dive, this year, has
been the absolutely horrific state of Discovery on Apple's App Store. If
you'd thought to search the top charts under the store's Music category,
you wouldn't find any of the gems I'm going to highlight, here. The
credit for exposing me to their existence, in fact, lies with
/MacStories/ -- a hard-hitting, well-established Apple-adjacent media
company piloted by [[https://twitter.com/viticci][Federico Viticci]]. At
this very moment, their app-centric podcast, /App Stories/, is in the
midst of [[https://appstories.net/episodes/212/][a special mini-series]]
devoted to Music on iOS/Mac, from which this Post draws upon heavily.
For better or worse, they represent the definitive authority on this
subject (among many others, naturally,) though I wouldn't necessarily
recommend their various publications be added to the reading lists of
any but those most invested in iOS.

There is something uniquely concrete about a purely-chronological feed
which we've lost in the past 5-10 years in favor of algorithmic
curation, generally. The
[[https://bilge.world/tweetbot-6-ios-review][next item]] in /this/
particular feed, in fact, includes my attempt to explain why Twitter's
hard-chronological Lists feature has sheltered me from the anxiety of
the service's main timeline, now ordered by proprietary (and obscured)
formulas. I'd been aware of that dynamic in my own Twitter consumption
for years, though. I certainly did /not/ anticipate the impact of the
music release equivalent of a chronological timeline as provided by
[[https://apps.apple.com/us/app/musicharbor/id1440405750][*MusicHarbor*]]
-- an app for iOS and MacOS that acts as a frontend for one's music
library across both Apple Music and Spotify.

It's hard to remember how we (Apple Music) got here without embarking
upon some gargantuan /A Complete Visual History of Apple Music/-like
document, but it must be said that Tim Cook's “next chapter in music”
has become a sad afterthought. As far as I understand it, the “streaming
war” between Apple and Spotify has long since gone definitively to the
latter in statistical terms, which I'd suggest to be an overall positive
outcome for Apple Music subscribers, generally. The self-perception
within the heavy music consumer crowd of “niche,” “underground,”
“obscure” cultural minority should -- in theory -- push those who
believe themselves /destined to be different/ away from Spotify into the
handy care of Apple, the absolute champion of this particular
self-deception. To be honest -- though I write this for /all/ listeners,
sincerely -- I have found myself in a sort of utopian echo chamber of my
own design in music culture terms. My days of waiting through 4+ hours
of local openers before rap shows are far behind me, and I consume and
engage exclusively with music I find personally redeemable.

My Apple Music library has become quite fragmented after I lost my
entire physical music collection along with the external drives
containing my accumulated digital music library in 2017. Still, after
more or less starting anew this past December and casually, deliberately
adding digital files back into the accursed, ancient iTunes desktop
application and restoring some (outdated) versions of my handful of
shared curatorial playlists thanks to SongShift (which we'll glance on
later,) MusicHarbor currently lists 1433 artists represented across my
Apple Music and (very sparse) Spotify libraries. I know this because of
[[https://routinehub.co/shortcut/8935/][a very simple Siri Shortcut]] I
modified which returns a text list of all Artists in one's MusicHarbor
library in Quick Look.
([[https://gist.github.com/extratone/32763d8d2d6a71ab0fe4e045a6fb4441][Here
is my result]] as of this moment in GitHub Gist form.) According my App
Store receipts, I first downloaded MusicHarbor on March 26 -- 20 days
ago -- which is mentionable because of how much I've accomplished with
very minimal time investment in terms of curating my own music library
thanks to MusicHarbor. As you'll note in the 3rd of the 4 screenshots
embedded above, I was able to delete System of a Down from my library --
a single function which alone justifies the app's one-time $5.99 “Unlock
Everything” fee, to my sensibility. I've also been able to begin
following all the artists represented in a few of my favorite playlists
with a handful of taps -- a task which would literally require hours in
the native Apple Music app of old (when one could actually follow
artists, there.) On that note, it's time to cite the primary
/MacStories/ article you should read, entitled
“[[https://www.macstories.net/ios/how-i-keep-track-of-new-music-releases/][How
I Keep Track of New Music Releases]],” regarding Apple Music's
performance as a release tracker:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  The ‘New Releases' section is tucked at the very end of the For You
  page and laid out as a horizontal carousel that requires a lot of
  swiping; you can view the ‘New Releases' page as a grid, which has
  sections for different weeks, but, in my experience, it only
  aggregates highlights for new releases from some of my favorite
  artists. The ‘New Music Mix' playlist is not terrible, but it often
  comes loaded with stale data -- songs I've already listened to
  multiple times and which shouldn't qualify as “new” weeks after their
  original release date. Furthermore, I've found notifications for new
  releases for artists in my library unreliable at best: I occasionally
  get notifications for new albums, but never for new singles or EPs.
#+END_QUOTE

Here, Federico Viticci is riffing off
[[https://chorus.fm/features/liner-notes-november-1st-2019/][a
newsletter issue]] written by music blogger Jason Tate, in which he
describes the service's missing tracking functionality as “the single
most frustrating part of Apple Music.” Though these points in the
conversation are both almost two years old, MusicHarbor remains the
ultimate means of tracking new music releases chronologically on Apple's
platforms. Though I am personally just three weeks in, the confidence
this app has given me in the certainty of its chronological release feed
is quite profound. Its integration with one's calendar to track
/upcoming/ releases is a bit much for my own needs, but I know
personally enough invested curators for whom it'd be a godsend to mark
it no small addition.

[[file:xhtml/https:/i.snap.as/UxLBTYvL.png]]

MusicHarbor's only downside is entirely excusable/understandable, in
context: it's a bit clunky. For the sake of this work, I set up
[[https://music.apple.com/us/playlist/musicharbor/pl.u-2aoq40vTaR0XmA][a
shared Apple Music playlist]] so I could further demonstrate all the new
music I discovered in MusicHarbor. Adding whole albums to this playlist
with a single tap /feels/ powerful because it /is/ -- I've no idea what
sort of developer wizardry is involved in such an action, but the Wait
Wheel doesn't feel like too much to endure. Adding a release to one's
library -- the other in-MusicHarbor accumulative function -- is a bit
quicker. It's important to remember that this piece of software was/is
created and maintained by a single human being, though I would expect
nothing but improvement, going forward.

[[file:xhtml/https:/i.snap.as/yN3nbcdR.png]]

That's all I have to report on MusicHarbor, for the moment, but I'll add
further /MacStories/ praise from their

[[https://apps.apple.com/us/app/albums-album-focused-player/id1469948986][Albums]],
which actually functions as an entire replacement frontend player for
Apple Music. Reviewed
[[https://www.macstories.net/reviews/albums-4-0-a-must-have-app-for-music-lovers/][much
more recently by /MacStories/]], it really is best-described as
“opinionated, favoring album playback over individual songs or
playlists.” Considering that I installed the app just a week ago and
have focused most of my attention on MusicHarbor in that time, I'll
leave most of the commentary to John Voorhees. All I can say, really, is
that I see an extremely powerful application, here, for a fairly
specific use case: someone who's listening is largely occupied by albums
they already “own” in Apple Music and treasure deeply. The ability to
set an individual record's “Immersive UI Tint” down to the hex (in
“Album Settings”) is as in-depth a tool of adoration as I've ever seen
in a digital music service. Combined with Albums' presumptuous takeover
of actual playback from the Apple Music app, I think I can rightfully
say that it was built for the /extremely serious/ music consumer.

My favorite part so far: the app knew well enough to offer me THE ZRO
BUTTON. Telling, I think.

the past few years, resulting in one of the most useful Siri Shortcuts
integrations to be found for real, reasonable human beings. Here's where
Apple-adjacent media and I part ways...

While current common conversation might point you to Federico Viticci's
[[https://www.macstories.net/ios/introducing-musicbot-the-all-in-one-apple-music-assistant-powered-by-shortcuts/][MusicBot
hyper-Shortcut]] and/or @gianflo6's 600 action-strong

expectedly) would point you to
[[https://routinehub.co/shortcut/8940/][my own, 17-action Shortcut]]
which spares you any selections and simply opens the Song.Link URL of
the track currently playing in Apple Music (while also copying said URL
to the clipboard.) It's not that MusicBot isn't massively impressive and
still useful, but it represents a class of super/hyper-Shortcuts which
(from my perspective) /far/-overreach beyond the intended use case for
Siri Shortcuts and end up immediately bewildering/alienating potential
new users. Truthfully -- as Federico singularly acknowledges -- they are
full /applications/ built atop a less-than-ideal platform designed for
relatively simple, /repeatable/ automations. I'll spare you further
opining on this idea until another, potential Post, and instead
demonstrate my personal solution.

[[https://imgur.com/gallery/eblzlbD]]

In the clip above, you can see I was working on this very draft when
LoneMoon's “[[https://song.link/i/1554970332][kawAii @F]]” started
playing. Naturally, I was compelled to share it on Twitter, so --
without leaving Drafts (my writing app) -- I called the
[[https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/siri-iphaff1d606/ios][type-to-Siri]]
prompt by holding the Sleep/Wake button on my iPhone 12 Pro Max and
simply typed “sl” (I renamed my Shortcut for this use,) running the
Shortcut, which opened the track's Song.Link page in Safari -- very much
an optional step, mostly just to make sure the match is correct -- and
copied its URL to my clipboard, from which I could share it anywhere.
Since the advent of widgets in iOS'
[[https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/add-widgets-to-the-home-screen-iphb8f1bf206/ios][Today
View]], I've also kept a button for this Shortcut in one of four
precious slots in a box at the very top. For those willing to play
around a bit, it should be fairly straightforward to configure the end
bits to your liking, but it should work out of the box for even those
least interested in Siri Shortcuts/automation in general.

What if you actually want to “make” music with your iPhone? We've seen
iPhone television ads for years featuring amalgamations of
musician-looking types playing instruments with cables attached to their
handsets, but is the iPhone now a reasonable platform for any sort of
serious sound capture? The short answer is *no*. Who am I to proclaim
such an absolute? None other than the motherfucker who's been messing
around with mobile DAWs for
[[https://twitter.com/neoyokel/status/150752825129971712][10 whole
years]]. I even “released” an
“[[https://dieselgoth.bandcamp.com/album/holistic-compliance-portal][album]]”
on Bandcamp made exclusively with Apple's own GarageBand for iOS and
inspired by the dangerous life of the contemporary raw milk smuggler. I
wouldn't call it “music,” per se, or an example of what a /real/
electronic producer could pull off in the app, but it does represent its
capabilities in the hands of the average user, using mostly default
loops.

[[https://soundcloud.com/dieselgoth/wurlie-jam]]

While Apple does publish an Apple Book entitled
“[[https://books.apple.com/us/book/everyone-can-create-music/id1434741739][Everyone

at /iPad/-bound use. Any serious DAW user uses keyboard shortcuts, which
I admit I only discovered recently in GarageBand for iOS. The
[[https://support.apple.com/guide/garageband-ipad/use-keyboard-shortcuts-chs88452c59a/ipados][official

them still work on iPhone.

[[https://apps.apple.com/us/app/fl-studio-mobile/id432850619][*FL Studio

apparently. While I did, indeed purchase the original version on my
iPhone 4, I remember absolutely nothing about it, suggesting I was over

and
[[https://apps.apple.com/us/app/reason-compact-make-music/id1253419004][*Reason

little to report.

Disappointingly, Apple's own Music Memos -- as demonstrated by Chris
Welch from /The Verge/ in the embed, above -- is currently in the
process of being
[[https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/10/22168102/apple-music-memos-app-discontinued-export,][officially
sunsetted]] and is now no longer available for download on the App
Store. As that article notes, users are instead directed toward
GarageBand or ye olde native
[[https://apps.apple.com/us/app/voice-memos/id1069512134][*Voice
Memos*]] to record high quality audio. /However/, if you want to take
advantage of the *stereo audio recording* capabilities included in
iPhones after the
[[https://www.dxomark.com/apple-iphone-11-audio-review/][11 Pro]], you
must either use the native Camera app to capture video (and extract the
audio later,) or
[[https://apps.apple.com/us/app/dolby-on-record-audio-video/id1443964192][*Dolby
On*]] -- Dolby's own iOS app for recording which -- if I'm completely
honest -- will do nothing but /utterly frustrate/ anyone trying to
capture the truest digital audio possible.

[[https://youtube.com/watch?v=GhAknEKy9Ig]]

As part of my [[https://github.com/extratone/bilge/issues/45][iPhone 12
Pro Max Review]], I've accumulated quite a few audio files in various
formats testing its capture abilities and stashed them in
[[https://github.com/extratone/bilge/tree/main/audio/Capture%20Testing][this
folder]] on /The Psalms/' GitHub Repository. Probably the most relevant
of these, though, is embedded just above. If you'll forgive my pajamas,
ridiculous piano faces, and general rustiness with the instrument, it
demonstrates the “*Audio Zoom*” feature found in the iPhone 11 Pro and
up, which I've found to be unfortunately underdocumented by Apple,
itself. I added my own inquiry to
[[https://developer.apple.com/forums/thread/124512?answerId=671299022#671299022][this
post on the official Developer forums]] asking about it, but don't
really expect anything back. According to
“[[https://www.dxomark.com/what-is-audio-zoom-for-smartphones/][What is
Audio Zoom for smartphones]]?” published on the site /DxOMark/:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  The main technology behind audio zoom is called beamforming, or
  spatial filtering. It allows changing an audio recording's directivity
  (that is, the sensitivity according to the direction of the sound
  source) and shape it in any way necessary. In this case, the optimal
  directivity is a hypercardioid pattern (see illustration below), which
  enhances sounds coming from the front direction --- that is, from the
  direction in which your camera is pointed --- while attenuating sounds
  from all other directions (your background noise).
#+END_QUOTE

My testing has suggested that *the best means of recording
unfiltered-as-possible stereo audio with an iPhone is to record video at
1x zoom with the native Camera app* and extract the audio from the video
file. In the [[https://davidblue.bandcamp.com/track/-][Bandcamp track
embedded below]], I “mounted” my 12 Pro Max right above my old upright's
soundboard and extracted audio directly from the video file with
Audacity. It was then amplified slightly, saved to a FLAC file and
uploaded directly to Bandcamp. Of course, it's worth qualifying that --
while I have extensive experience with audio -- I have neither
professional training, nor any professional monitoring equipment.

[[https://davidblue.bandcamp.com/track/-]]

That said, the biggest objection I've heard from audiophiles regarding
audio capture and manipulation on handsets, generally, has to do with
their hardware's extremely limited capabilities when compared to any
sort of professional desktop soundcard. Given the greater argument I've
come to regarding the state of consumer tech as best exemplified by
smartphone design -- that we've come to expect /far/ too much of single
devices, and the resulting jack-of-all-tradeness summing their real-life
capabilities has become a *severe detriment* instead of a feature -- I
must echo, again, that adding “studio” audio capture, manipulation, and
production capabilities to our /goddamned cellular phones/ doesn't help
anyone. To any user truly hoping to accomplish these things, I say /just
go home/ and boot up your damned desktop.

The final episode in /AppStories/' three-part miniseries on music was
[[https://appstories.net/episodes/214/][just published today]], though I
suspect -- for my audience, anyway -- that its coverage is mostly
out-of-scope on this topic, largely for financial reasons. Apple's first
event of the year is [[https://youtu.be/JdBYVNuky1M][scheduled for
tomorrow at noon]], my time, and is entitled “Spring Loaded,” which --
combined with its 4/20 joke date -- suggests to me that we'll finally
see the release of the APPLE GUN™ alongside iWeed™, but little to
nothing in the way of music.

In the midst of my brief research into /The Greater History of Apple
Music/, I discovered
[[https://thenextweb.com/news/apple-shuttering-failed-social-music-network-ping-september-30th][the
existence of iTunes Ping]] -- which I somehow missed entirely,
[[https://twitter.com/mrjaydeeem/status/1379305438454423559][along with
my Twitter friend Jon Male]]. I also discovered articles from the
company's decision to
[[https://thenextweb.com/news/apple-music-is-dropping-its-connect-social-features][kill
its successor “Connect” from Apple Music]], which was reportedly
“[[https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/13/18139837/apple-music-connect-social-network-feature-discontinued][rarely
used]].” Notably, this removal also
[[https://9to5mac.com/2018/12/13/apple-music-connect-ping/][took away]]
what little power Artists had over the narrative surrounding their music
on the service. I can see the business justification for all of this
(barely) /except/ for removing the ability for users to follow artists.

The latest Apple Music feature --
[[https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/19/21523091/apple-music-videos-tv-channel-live-stream][a
“channel” for music videos]] -- also makes zero sense to me, but
[[https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/5/20851576/apple-music-web-player-interface-beta-browser-streaming][the
launch of Apple Music on the web]] /absolutely/ does, especially for
Windows and Linux users, who are now /officially/ freed from iTunes (the
software) and allowed to use a much more modern Apple Music experience.
I prepended “officially,” there, because third-party Apple Music web
players have existed as long as the service has allowed the required
integration. First, there was
[[https://www.macrumors.com/2018/12/13/apple-music-unofficial-web-player/][Naveed
Golafshani's]] -- which is
[[https://github.com/naveedgol/music-web-player][no longer live]] -- but
Brychan Bennett-Odlum's
[[https://www.macrumors.com/2019/01/21/apple-music-web-player-musish/][*Musish*]]
is still [[https://musi.sh/][live and working]], as you can see from the
screenshot embedded above. Other than the ability to select between two
stream bitrates, I can't seen any remaining advantages to using the
latter over Apple's own web player, unless you harbor spite toward their
handling of the whole thing, which would be entirely understandable,
from my perspective.

[[https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/1359364473253937153]]

As someone who grew up in the mp3 era with a
[[https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/1359364473253937153][first-generation
iPod Shuffle]] and iTunes, living and dying between iTunes Store gift
cards, Apple Music still seems like one hell of a magical deal. In
effect, it allows access to /all of iTunes/ for a flat monthly fee. Or
at least it /would/ had I never become acquainted with professional
independent musicians who've published, there, and have to contend with
tedious realities like
[[https://artists.apple.com/support/675-send-your-lyrics-to-apple-music][the
process by which one can add those beautiful lyrics to Apple Music
tracks]], and who's only real means of control/engagement on the service
has been removed with virtually zero prospects of a replacement. If,
indeed, Jessica Lessin was correct about Apple's obsession with music,
it has resulted in very little for any class of music makers, and left
even its listeners to seek out and find third-party solutions like
MusicHarbor to perform even the most basic personalization one expects
from a modern music streaming service without even bothering to amend
their App Store's discovery process to illuminate them, or even write a
fucking App Story. Despite this, one-to-three-person app teams continue
to work on new solutions, to these and other problems...

One of the handful of Siri's most useful features has been the “Hey
Siri! Where are you?” command, to which Siri will respond “I'm here” or
“here I am!” Were it possible to view how many times one has triggered a
particular Siri command on iOS, my personal reliance on it would almost
certainly be embarrassing. Often, my handset isn't even obscured from
view -- it's just faster to have Siri speak up than it is to scan the
room. Occasionally, however, my device has managed to become embedded
beneath and/or within some genuinely-perplexing series of couch
cushions/blankets/briefcase pockets/etc. which require a more constant
homing sort of audio reproduction. Asking friends/family to call one's
phone is the general goto, yes, but honestly the actual length of time
cellular telephones will ring before sending a caller to voicemail in
2021 is /ridiculously/ short, especially when rummaging through
Gourd-knows-what. For that matter, most of my peers keep their phones on
silent mode, 24/7. What then?

[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3evgnSlnkjk]]

Since [[https://bilge.world/siri-shortcuts-ios12-review][the very first
time]] I set eyes upon Siri Shortcuts in iOS 12 Beta, I have wanted to
create one to address this issue in a creative, entertaining, and
(hopefully) genuinely-useful way. On that day almost three years ago, I
even knew it would be called /Marco!/, believe it or not. In the past
few months, I've returned to the project on and off and ended up with
several different versions of varying complexity. One day, I'd like to
figure out how to integrate the full extent of my ideas for Marco! into
a Shortcut which can be reliably triggered when one's device is locked,
but for this first release version, I have included only what I and a
few other (much appreciated) volunteers were able to trigger in every
situation we could conceive of.

Marco! Version 1.0 can be downloaded on
[[https://routinehub.co/shortcut/8987/][*RoutineHub*]] (which I would
highly recommend,) or directly via
[[https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/cec781677c5648f2a8982213700938b4][*this
iCloud share link*]]. I know it's a bit excessive, but I even created a
[[https://github.com/extratone/marco][GitHub Repository]] just for this
Shortcut, seeing as it is undoubtedly the most original I will ever
contribute, and the singular one with potential for continued
development.

Download Marco! as is and (as long as you don't rename it) use “Hey
Siri!... Marco!” This should immediately run the Shortcut, which
includes my voice saying “Polo! Bitch!” followed by five repeats of the
flashlight/noise cycle as described in detail below.

[[file:xhtml/https:/i.snap.as/9Ow1cbmz.png]]

As documented by the
[[https://github.com/extratone/marco/blob/main/docs/Marco!.html][Jellycuts
file]] above, Version 1.0 of Marco!'s actions are as follows:

1.  Turn Low Power Mode OFF
2.  Turn Airplane Mode OFF
3.  Turn Wi-Fi On
4.  Turn Bluetooth On
5.  Set brightness to 100%
6.  Turn Do Not Disturb OFF
7.  Turn appearance Light
8.  Set playback destination to iPhone
9.  Set volume to 89%
10. Vibrate device (Not currently working.)
11. Play *my voice* saying “Polo!” + a few other items
12. Toggle (flash) the flashlight 5 times (odd number leaving your
    flashlight on constantly unless it was on before the Shortcut was
    triggered)
13. Simultaneously (in the same repeat action) plays three separate
    classic Mac sounds 5 times.

The most clever bit about this particular Shortcut is its use of Base64
text to include audio playback. I just fixed a bug on
[[https://routinehub.co/shortcut/8914/][my own Base64 audio encoder
Shortcut]] if you'd like to try it out. Since this version includes my
own voice (subject to taste, I realize,) as well as some minor
profanity, I do intend to publish a clean variation at some point in the
future. If this is an obstacle for you, and/or if you'd like a custom
version made with audio of your own choosing, please do
[[mailto:davidblue@extratone.com][send me an email]]! I would be more
than happy to make one for you.

I have written more than my fair share of words about software, as I
have loved, despised, and been utterly perplexed by it. This year, my
return to the iOS community has perhaps inevitably turned /apps/ into an
addiction of sorts. This particular platform is so utterly chock
full/stocked up of creativity at a scale immeasurably greater and more
accessible than the whole of those throughout computing history,
combined. For someone like myself, it is all too easy to allow oneself
to wander down a virtually endless path of intriguing, very
self-indulgent play, especially now that third-party sites like
[[https://departures.to][Departures.to]] have managed to add
discoverability to TestFlight beta distributions, allowing those
non-millionaires among us opportunities to use test releases of
applications we would've otherwise had to pay for. This has been
exclusively to my benefit -- I can only imagine what 15 year-old me
would have done with such power.

[[file:xhtml/https:/i.snap.as/jIYBC6xU.png]]

In my recent endeavor to focus on making my work more useful to others,
I've reflected on something I've heard from nigh every developer of the
apps I've reviewed: /Ah yes, your blog looks really cool but FOR THE
LOVE OF GOD, PLEASE REVIEW MY FUCKING APP on the FUCKING STORE./ Read:
your commentary is appreciated, but your five stars would almost
certainly more economically beneficial.

As you can see from the image embedded above, I have personally fallen
/very/ behind in doing my part for those apps I've celebrated, here. A
vague intention to /get around to it eventually/ clearly is not working,
so I've decided to give myself a deadline: *August 15th, 2021* --
precisely one month from today. By this date, I will have sifted through
my commentary on apps in this setting and adapted the most useful of it
(per app, obviously) into a manner appropriate to appear on an App Store
Page, and *I would like to formally-ish invite other tech writers/app
reviewers to join me*.

[[https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/1402057069927309318]]

I'm terrible at community organization, which certainly does not exclude
events, so I very much welcome any feedback you might have, as well as
any collaborative contributions you'd be interested in making. As I see
it, I have a few essential considerations to offer.

First, the page in the screen capture above -- which can be found in the
App Store App ⇨ Account (your profile picture in the top-right corner) ⇨
Account Settings (the tapable element at the very top with your profile
picture and information) ⇨ Ratings and Reviews -- is /broken as hell/,
along with the rest of the Account Settings menu, notably. This is
important because I insist we all complain about it on all available
channels, considering it's been broken for several months, at least.

Second, you should almost certainly use
[[https://tools.applemediaservices.com/app-store/][*this “new”
dev-facing tool*]] when searching the App Store, considering that it
/actually works/ in a trustable way, unlike the user-facing tool in the
app.

[[https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/1415732070626758663]]

Since the standard online palette of event organization software are all
so easy to use, these days, I've established event pages for this event
on multiple platforms, linked in the list below, which I will update as
per any suggestions/requests for equivalent pages on other services. Of
course, it's certainly not a requirement that you join/engage with any
of them.

One could could certainly just add the date to their own calendar
(conveniently with
[[https://drive.google.com/file/d/1WM2esll-Yf5Fg4gO9ZYVAJ0pPrdexGqF/view?usp=sharing][this
.ics file]],) remain entirely silent about the thing on social, and
still be participating. Those interested in further engagement, however,
can Chat Me Up on [[https://bit.ly/extratone][/Extratone/'s Discord]],
the [[https://teams.live.com/meet/93913819139325][Teams event chat]],
[[https://t.me/extratoe][Telegram]], [[https://davidblue.wtf][etc]]. I
also plan to reshare most of this post as

mostly responsible for making its platforms a worthwhile space, I hope
I've created something of value in whipping up this “event.” If you have
thoughts on how I might do so more effectively, once again, /please do/

Apple's second virtual World Wide Developer Conference came and went as
I wrote this guide -- you can metaphorically picture me looking up from
my machine having overheard the news of the
[[https://developer.apple.com/design/awards/][2021 Apple Design Award
Winners]] announcement. Perusing through them, I saw two I would have
voted for, myself:
[[https://apps.apple.com/us/app/carrot-weather/id961390574][CARROT
Weather]] -- the
[[https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/1368223231111557125][beautifully
vulgar]], grumpy bitch frontend for your preferred weather information
service, and
[[https://apps.apple.com/us/app/craft-docs-and-notes-editor/id1487937127][Craft]]
-- perhaps the most innovative take on word processing of the past two
or three years -- listed under “Finalists.” (Read: losers.) The most
positive personal discovery of (all?) WWDCs: an app called
[[https://www.bemyeyes.com/][*Be My Eyes*]], which “connects blind and
low-vision people with sighted volunteers and company representatives
for visual assistance through a live video call,” along with an
exceptionally crafted, cross-device accessible-as-fuck TTS solution
called
[[https://apps.apple.com/us/app/voice-dream-reader/id496177674][Voice
Dream Reader]]. /However/, a double take in games from /Genshin Impact/
and
[[https://apps.apple.com/ph/app/league-of-legends-wild-rift/id1480616990][the
fucking /League of Legends/ game]] certainly sours the mouth and
suggests yet further just how much Apple, Inc. has /sold out/.

The continued prioritization of Growth for Growth's sake over any and
all other considerations (namely, users,) is not unexpected from even
the most valuable company in the history of the world, I suppose, but
there /is/ an actor at this point in the story who is catastrophically
and demonstrably failing to fulfill their role: all I really know is
that technology media has fallen into a trough of total uselessness when
it comes to qualitative, authoritative analysis of consumer-targeted
software. The necessity of this guide -- and the bizarrely silent
ignorance of even the “fringes” on its subject -- is unimaginably
severe. Before me has been (for years, now,) the “answer” to a Jolly Big
Load of what tech and marketing types lament in more and more
existential language, yet /hardly any/ of the humans with the most to
lose from their negligence -- regular, casual social media users -- have
been delivered to these experiences. The story is not being articulated.
*The journalism is not being done.*

I know you almost certainly did not arrive here to hear one
motherfucker's complaints about WWDC, but -- as with everything Apple,
Inc. does -- every morsel of curatorial
expression/discrimination/favoritism from The Great Money God within
this platform /must/ be scrutinized and criticized. Quite frankly, I
found myself completely at a loss as to how /not/ to dwell on the
Discovery Disparity, here.

Despite how deeply I've gone into iOS this year, I do not believe myself
to be a qualified judge of software design, but I no longer believe
Apple to be, either. Regardless of the revenue-related controversies of
late, Apple have simply become terrible stewards of the App Store in
every imaginable sense. Scams and blatant intellectual property theft
abound, while the majority of the most innovative entries I've ever seen
remain entirely obfuscated and uncelebrated by all of Apple. Inc.'s
mechanisms. If you required an explanation for the amount of time I've
invested into App Guides -- a space to which I never would have imagined
intentionally bringing /The Psalms/ -- I hope you can understand.

I must confess: I have been /meaning/ to write this app guide since even
before I [[https://bilge.world/eugen-rochko-interview][interviewed
Mastodon creator Eugen Rochko]] on the morning of his Big Press Day,
just over 4 years ago. I've exhaustively explored different means of
convincing my own longtime Twitter friends to move, over that time, with
very little success. Eugen, himself, published an
[[https://blog.joinmastodon.org/2021/02/developing-an-official-ios-app-for-mastodon/][official
blog post]] at the beginning of February detailing his plans to open up
onboarding by way of “an official Mastodon app that is free to download
and that is specialized in helping new users get started on the
platform.” As a Patreon supporter of
[[https://www.patreon.com/mastodon][The Mastodon Project]] (full
disclosure,) I've been testing this app (see preview shots at the very
end,) and am quite smitten with it. That said, I thought it might be
worth going over the third-party options iOS users currently have
available to them, largely because the offerings are each innovative and
mature applications in their own right. (Also, it's become quite
apparent that the normal tech media sources you'd go to for such a guide
aren't going to give Mastodon the attention it deserves.)

** Obligatory(?) Context
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: section0107.xhtml#obligatory-context
   :END:

I originally intended to be as clinical as possible in this Post, having
realized its potential as the singular comparison of its kind to appear
in search results for new and potential users of Mastodon. From my
perspective, Mastodon has long since surpassed regard as a novel social
media experiment who's function is to prompt academic conversations
about decentralization, open source, ad tech, and federated social's
solutions to all of the Big Web's Big Boy (proprietary) Problems (though
I have been compelled to [[https://github.com/extratone/bigblue][invest
significantly]] in that very conversation.) In the less intellectual
hours of my day-to-day life (read: most of the time,) Mastodon is
nothing more or less than my favorite place on the internet. It is a
relentless delight which I only lament because I want to share so much
of it with my friends, but have continued to fail in my efforts to
articulate that *Mastodon is not a compromise; it is a better social
space*.

If you didn't know, this seems to have become /my general shit/, for
lack of a better term: the ethical considerations of open
source/“alternative” software are very important, yes! ... but they are
/far/ from the whole, and they are not a requisite for new users. The
second of [[https://bilge.world/about][this World Wide Web Blog's
fundamental considerations]], in fact:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  The Open Source/Open Web community continues to struggle with their
  /brand image/ (if you will) in both old and new ways that needlessly
  alienate (and sometimes obfuscate) some of their most important
  contributions from the average user. *Technology media has failed in
  their responsibility to address this issue.*
#+END_QUOTE

The blog on which you're reading this, in fact, is federated on
[[https://activitypub.rocks/][ActivityPub]]. If you so chose, you could
be reading it in any client capable of displaying large bodies of text.
The crucial point, though, is that /you didn't need to know that/ -- you
could very well go on reading it on the web in total ignorance/apathy
regarding Federation.

/Oh boy, here we go.../ No. I did not want to say anything ideological
-- I wanted this Post to function as little more than a pretty
screenshot showcase and simple associative list responding to all of the
Reddit posts I've seen to the tune of “is there an iPhone app?” As I
explored them, however, I was reminded of the sheer creativity the
“alternative” software community is capable of. Even the roughest of
these considered apps seem unable to be faceless -- sorting through the
obscene amount of (unlabeled) screenshots accumulated over the past
weeks of testing in my Recents folder has been /so/ much easier than I
thought it would be because of their relentless originality. If you've
actually used any iOS applications and/or browsed the singular App Store
from which they can be acquired in the past 3-4 years, you're
undoubtedly skeptical: what we might have called “feature overlap” at
one time has become all but the platform's core ethos. If you're the
sort who enjoys screwing around with apps, generally, as I have for the
whole of iPhone history, you have grown accustomed to disappointment.

[[https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/1402057069927309318]]

Regardless of who is to blame, we can all agree that the App Store is
currently oversaturated nigh /beyond usability/ with mediocre entries
built from the beginning with zero apparent ambition toward original
function. This, alone, wouldn't be so problematic if Discovery were not
so [[https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/1379068906917224448][completely
and totally Fucked]] (except when
[[https://tools.applemediaservices.com/app-store/][dev-facing]],) but I
needn't comment further on that subject at the moment -- I'm just trying
emphasize how absolutely unheard of it is for a single
protocol/service's third-party client representation on iOS to be so
thoroughly special. It was astonishing to find all but one or two of
these apps /in a functional state/, actually. In all my equivalent
experiences downloading the entirety of a given service's API-supported
palette (e.g. IRC apps,
[[https://www.vice.com/en/article/pkbgvg/major-internet-projects-are-leaving-freenode-after-korean-prince-takeover][topically]],)
an all-too-significant purpose of whatever ends up getting published is
simply documenting the ~20% of available titles that /actually work/ at
the given moment. (I'd have mentioned the “best [service/task] iPhone
apps for [year]” listicles found in online publications like /Digital
Trends/ were it not for the percentage of them in which it's clear the
author /did not actually download/ some/most of the apps listed‽‽‽)
Perhaps due to
[[https://www.wsj.com/video/series/joanna-stern-personal-technology/apple-software-chief-explains-ios-145-defends-companys-reach-exclusive/57D138E3-3677-4A78-9534-62DAD443FE97][iOS
14.5's implementation of ATT]], all of the Mastodon apps I could find
and test (not counting non-English language-supporting apps, in
fairness' interest) are currently functioning.

So, if there's virtually zero chance a new Mastodon user might download
one of the apps we're about to consider and find it broken, what
practical function remains for this guide? Hopefully, to establish a SEO
catch-all for such users from a non-automated source less associated
with the project than the official apps list. Those for whom Mastodon is
still an unfamiliar subject should find the collected imagery
intriguing, hopefully.

My first step in writing this guide was to post
[[https://www.reddit.com/r/Mastodon/comments/mxymr1/your_thoughts_on_thirdparty_mastodon_clients_for/][a
thread on r/Mastodon]] soliciting thoughts on third-party Mastodon apps
from other users, who expressed a lot of love for Toot! and Metatext:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE

Pragmatic Code's
[[https://apps.apple.com/us/app/linky-for-twitter-and-mastodon/id438090426][Linky]]
was also mentioned by multiple respondents. It's not a client, but a
bridging tool for smoother URL sharing that integrates with iOS' share
sheet. I did not have time to try it, myself, but from all accounts, it
is an obligatory mention. So too is the
[[https://github.com/extratone/FediiOS][*GitHub Repository/List*]] I
created in order to “formally” offer a list with much greater brevity
and zero editorialization.

First, let's begin with The Big 6 -- those apps The Mastodon Project,
itself, has seen fit to [[https://joinmastodon.org/apps][list on
joinmastodon.org]].

[[https://youtube.com/watch?v=LdBFMibyh3Y]]

Dag Ågren‘s [[https://apps.apple.com/us/app/toot/id1229021451][Toot!]]
is not only my personal app of choice -- I would (and have) go so far as
to say it's the single most innovative mobile social app I've ever
encountered, largely because of its jacknife-esque instance selection.
It's held a place in my phone's dock since the day I first downloaded
it, for this and many other reasons. While one might find bugs/loose
ends (understandably) exploring the functions of other indie social
clients, within Toot!, they will only find little delights, like
[[https://imgur.com/gallery/xAXs95J][its wholly unique Share Sheet
interface]].

[[file:xhtml/https:/i.snap.as/bXG5SAUv.png]]

Toot! is extremely beautiful (despite its unfortunate name,) and I am
quite superficial in my taste. It's Obsidian theme (which may or may not
be related to the topical notetaking system of the same name) is
especially gorgeous.

In my
[[https://mastodon.social/@DavidBlue/106302686196643266][cacophonous
attempt]] to compare the notifications of all available Mastodon apps
simultaneously, it's worth noting that Toot!'s always came first. Its
[[https://whyp.it/t/toot-ios-app-custom-sounds-92997][charming custom
audio alerts]] also make them my favorite by far.

They're not just cute: in reflection informed by a newly-considered
function of these apps -- serving as representing the network as a whole
-- it occurred to me that *Toot! audio alerts playing from my iPhone
have prompted more first-time conversations about Mastodon in the wild
than I can count*. (Seriously: they should be considered an onboarding
mechanism.)

[[file:xhtml/https:/i.snap.as/30YJR456.png]]

In my experience, it's also the most robust of the lot -- as in, it is
very much the exception rather than the norm to encounter any sort of
error or other obstruction in normal, day-to-day use. My own real
reservation applies to the entire selection discussed today: I wish
Toot! supported Bluetooth keyboard shortcuts.

The Original... Genesis... If Amaroq was not the first Mastodon app on
the App Store, it's certainly the oldest to survive. Its GitHub
Repository's
[[https://github.com/ReticentJohn/Amaroq/commit/9648ebdecf8ab20819ba10fe18b6317a8026fd86][first
commit]] dates back to April 17th, 2017. While you're there, you might
note that it's the only one of these entries coded entirely in
Objective-C -- the near-40-year-old language originally underpinning iOS
before Swift's birth in 2014. Amaroq was the first Mastodon app I used
and remains the strongest free option for iOS users. It's been nearly a
year since its last update, so its missing a few narrower functions like
Bookmarking and Polls, but the core features it /does/ include are rock
solid. The only wild card: what the fuck is Awoo Mode???

Unfortunately, the state of Mercury's App Store reviews prompt yet
another essential economic/editorial consideration. The one in the very
center of the image embedded, above -- from “FeralDandelion” -- is the
singular one I will allow myself to address. It is true that Mercury
straight up refuses to authenticate or federate with a substantial
amount of specific Mastodon servers, but it is *exhaustively explicit
about this from very get-go*. Its
[[https://onmercury.app/help][single-page Help document]] includes a
detailed, up-to-date table of every single blocked instance and /the
specific justification/ for each respective instance's presence on it:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  Mercury takes a zero tolerance stance on abuse and harassment and as
  such does not support many instances that promote abuse and
  harassment.
#+END_QUOTE

Let me be clear: the practical manifestation of this position is
*exclusively positive*. The Mastodon project has long outgrown the sort
of fixation on ideology for ideology's sake that even Lucky Linus
himself has no patience for. Instead, /thank Gourd/ Mercury's developers
took the time to better your social experience! In response to

/native/ -- seems inextricably linked with Metatext. I vaguely
understand what it means, and I do agree, but it's worth noting that I
speak with some privilege, having compared all of these apps on the top
performing handset Apple currently has to offer. In many ways, it is the
most frugal of the new offerings, especially, yet it strikes a keen
balance between function and delight. I think “native” can be translated
as /generally of a stout, sturdy disposition/, thanks to the care put

I'm not entirely positive which Mastodon app was /actually/ the first on
my iPhone, back in 2017, but I know for sure it was either Amaroq or the
dearest, infinitely-colorful Tootle. Its
[[https://mastodon.cloud/@tootleapp][App Store Page]] Version History
suggests it has not been updated in 14 months, yet the app -- which was
apparently “Designed for iPad” -- appears to be working just fine. There
are some overlapping UI elements, but they're barely noticeable. Were it
not for the new dev-facing store search tool mentioned above, I would
have assumed this app long gone, to be honest, but using it again has
somehow managed to genuinely twinge my nostalgia nerve.

In my search for any extra-App Store representation other than
[[https://mastodon.cloud/@tootleapp][Tootle's Mastodon Account]] (which
last posted the day after my birthday, last year,) I discovered

for Linux]]. Since I am a dedicated and thorough person, these days, I
spent several hours messing around with Linux Virtual Machining until
Lubuntu finally functioned /just/ so I could show you what it looks
like. Below is a screen capture of Tootle bordered by the most Macish
LXQ desktop bars included in Lubuntu and /even/ wearing the new official
Apple System Font, SF Pro. Still, I think you'll agree... Tootle for
Linux is not related to Tootle.

Personally, I find this a profound shame -- I think more apps should be
as colorful -- and as color /configurable/ -- as this little, mysterious
Mastodon app. I created the theme you see represented in the frames
embedded above using /The Psalms/ colors, naturally, and the whole
process took less than five minutes. Play around with it as I remember
doing, all those years ago, and you'd be surprised how hard it is to
create an unusable color theme. What I find /most/ shame in, though, is
that Tootle appears to be completely invisible in regular app store
searches, now. (And by “/most/ shame,” you know I really mean /entirely
fucking unacceptable/.)

Installing Roma for the first time led to a puzzling quest with a
particularly pleasant end. I noticed fairly quickly that the iOS app was
a re-branded release of what used to be Mast. My first instinct upon
this discovery was to DM Mast's original developer,
[[https://twitter.com/JPEGuin][Shihab Meboob]], on Twitter, but frankly,
I've already bothered him enough there over the years, so it's
understandable that I didn't hear back. When I downloaded the desktop
app I found on [[https://www.roma.rocks/#desktop][Roma's web page]] and
noticed its similarity to
[[https://whalebird.social/en/desktop/contents][Whalebird]], I decided
to use the site's contact form to
[[https://github.com/extratone/bilge/blob/main/correspondence/Roma%20Inquiry.md][inquire]]
about what exactly was going on as gingerly as I could. Happily, I
received a reply just /minutes/ later from Leo Radvinsky, head of
[[https://leo.com/][Leo.com]], “a Florida-based boutique venture capital
fund that invests in technology companies:”

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  Hi David,

  In both cases we funded the original developers of both Mast and
  Whalebird to create a branded whitelabel app specially made for
  Pleroma. The idea was to make Roma a cross platform brand/app. It
  didn't really work out so now we're working on a new app from scratch
  called Fedi for iOS and Android and releasing that as open source.

  [[https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?gl=US&hl=en_US&id=com.fediverse.app][https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.fediverse.app&hl=en_US&gl=US]]

  I think Roma has been removed from the app stores as it's no longer
  supported.

  Let me know if you have any other questions
#+END_QUOTE

Though my hopes for the original Mast to live on in Roma form were more
or less dashed by this message, the suggestion that someone is investing
*actual capital* into federated social is certainly worth celebrating.
If Roma is still available on the App Store as you're reading this, I
insist you download it immediately. It represents an incredible and
original attention to detail which should not simply be forgotten.

Naturally, the app inheriting the work/resources established by Mast and
Roma -- known by /Fedi/ -- should be next up for discussion. Hopefully,
my relative lack of experience with [[https://pleroma.social/][Pleroma]]
-- another ActivityPub-based, federated social network -- won't let you
down, here. After a brief shock from the uniqueness of Fedi's UI passes,
one immediately notices how beautifully it is animated, wholly
disregarding my
[[https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/1357394407201398791][recently-acquired]]
preference for as little animation as possible. Perhaps more than any
other app discussed here, Fedi feels uncannily bespoke in a way which
iOS apps almost never do. It is undoubtedly the result of a very
specific vision -- to disregard the whole modern template for social
apps and completely reimagine the archetype. Personally, I'm not sure if
it would be easy to get used to, but my tastes/habits in this regard are
very much the result of the past decade of proprietary social apps'
blandness. Going forward with substantial financial backing and the
talents of whoever it was that got it this far, no doubt we should all
have very high hopes for Fedi.

accidental (or habitual) Pulls to Refresh (set at 0,) load 400 Toots
from such a gesture, or anything in between (at 40-Toot increments,
anyway.) The advantages of this specification become immediately

is labeled as such to lead one to believe it is, indeed, the development
space for the iOS app we're discussing, but does not contain a single

understand it. Regardless, B4X appears to be built atop Anywhere
Software's “rapid application development tools.” I like its elemental

has caused me to involuntarily shriek. This might sound like an insult,
but it is actually the peak of my praise. I believe my knowledge of iOS
development safely allows me to suppose that StarPterano was built with
complete disregard for any established UI element libraries. That is,
the familiar toggles and buttons developers rely on to standardize the
iOS experience were cast aside entirely in favor of handbuilt,
translucent buttons of a sort of neon quality which call menus and text
entry fields no less alien to the platform. The most astonishing bit,
though, is that it /works/. On my 12 Pro Max, it's exceptionally smooth,
in fact.

found in the Settings menu of StarPterano's current build. I couldn't

[[https://qz.com/1726194/the-decline-of-douban-an-online-sanctuary-for-chinas-liberals/][a
single /Quartz/ article]] from October 2019. He eludes to a “boom” of
Mastodon adoption in the past few years and cites a lack of “user
friendly mobile clients” which I can only assume to be a conundrum
specific to China.

“With the aim of contributing to the community and to this movement, I
decided to take my quarantine time to build an enjoyable mobile client
for Douban Refugees,” he explains. He notes that decentralized platforms
have universally rejected algorithmic recommendation if for any other
reason than “without centralized computing power, such [a]
recommendation service is also not that feasible.” “Adapting” back to a
linear timeline in a manner which still encourages exploration was
clearly a major design consideration for tooot.

A few universal truths among these apps stand out as obligatory

[[https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/1393294957352468494][often exceed
100mb]]. They are all astonishingly *robust* -- I did not experience a
single crash in the course of normal testing these “alt” social apps-
even from the beta builds -- while I distinctly remember the official
Twitter app crashing several times over this period, even after I
deleted and reinstalled it (an accepted maintenance requirement for
anyone using it heavily for its entire history.) Also, on the topic of
the platform, itself, they are also made absurdly *interoperable* by the
ActivityPub standard. My [[https://pixelfed.social/DavidBlue][PixelFed]]
posts show up seamlessly on their timelines among content from
[[https://diasp.org/][Diaspora]], [[https://pleroma.social/][Pleroma]],
and Mastodon, itself.

[[https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/1393294957352468494]]

The overwhelming impression I was left with after testing these apps was
one of unwavering competence, cleverness, and true innovation. How many
different ways can I possibly conjure forth in order to communicate
this? I, David Blue -- the vain fucker with a precollection for the most

This couldn't be “just” an app guide -- I think I have thoroughly
accepted this, by now, just in time for some conclusionary remarks.
Somehow, the subject I originally tackled specifically because I thought
it would be quick, rudimentary, and straightforward has become yet
another personal journey. It'd feel a bit preposterous to declare any
one of these apps to be /life-changing/, but -- in every sense of the
term, in contemporary, inevitably social media-informed life, they do
indeed constitute a form of radical, ideological wellness. Each of them
managed to remind me of a different minute delight found within a
developer-user dynamic made up of thoughtful and effective minds working
to contribute original and valuable experiences, first. Most noteworthy
of these little freedoms: the realization that the upcoming “official”
Mastodon app along with any future new options are exclusively a
positive thing /for the user/... None of these apps were conceived to
gobble up market share because the market is fundamentally, inevitably,
uncompromisingly /infinitely shared/. I don't know anything about
business, but I /do/ know that relief from the burden of considering
proprietary multivectored development intentions has been personally
breathtaking. I can only hope the reciprocal compensation is happening
at even a fraction of what it “should” be.

From another essential direction, I hope I have communicated that
they're far from curious, “niche” or vanity side projects, now. When I
used the term “mature” in introducing this little arena, I very much
meant it -- these “alt” social clients developed almost exclusively
within single-person-led projects now make the Twitter for iOS app look
ugly /and/ fucking broken. “Giving social networking back to you” has
never been more resonant. Yes, it really is Toot!'s “take a break” blue
screen, Amaroq's mysterious Awoo mode toggle, iMast's music app
integration, Mercury's configurable timelines, Metatext's native
solidity, Tootle's custom colors, Tusker's Digital Wellness controls,
DUDU's elemental readability, Roma's quiet resurrection of Mast's UI
bravado, Stella's utterly bizarre visual departures, Fedi's odd animated
UI behaviors, Tootoise's consideration of /pace/, B4X's unfathomable
elements, Ore2's parallel timelines, tooot's development story, and
Oyakodon's adorable rough edges that have made my online life
/measurably/... /immensely/ better, these past weeks. At the forefront
of this perception is undoubtedly the comparatively extensive /control/
over my social experience as a user offered by the diversity of mobile
experiences these applications offer.

Those of you who haven't yet signed up for Mastodon: ==you are missing
the fuck out==. I am being /actually/ pampered, now, in World Wide Web
terms. You are [[https://bit.ly/dbmastodon][/so/ welcome]] whenever
you're ready -- the water is nice and warm, as they say.

Yes, you are looking at the currently in-development *“/Official/”
Mastodon app on iOS*, coming very soon to the Awful App Store. You can
join me in testing the app right this very moment by contributing to
[[https://www.patreon.com/mastodon][the Mastodon Project's Patreon]].
Though I do plan to publish
[[https://bilge.world/mastodon-ios-app-review][*a dedicated review*]] on
its release date, what I'll say for now is that it's very cute, includes
/the/ most gorgeous media player I've ever seen on an iOS app, and is as
distinctly clever as any of the third-party family we've just visited,
all whilst maintaining an expert's aim at its evangelist purpose.

The surprise that threw me over the edge to a genuinely pitiful extent:
the official Mastodon app already includes full *Bluetooth keyboard
shortcuts integration on iPhone!*

Indeed,
*[[https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mastodon-for-iphone/id1571998974][it is
here]]*. Essentially, Mastodon Commander-in-Chief Eugen Rochko and his
team developed a whole, exceptional iOS app in the span of time it took
me to write the [[https://bilge.world/mastodon-ios-apps][third-party
Mastodon iOS app showcase]] just before this item in /The Psalms/' feed.
If you're new to this conversation, perhaps it'd be best to start in
February of this year, with
[[https://blog.joinmastodon.org/2021/02/developing-an-official-ios-app-for-mastodon/][Eugen's
announcement of the “official” Mastodon app's development]] on the
official Mastodon blog. “We need an official Mastodon app that is free
to download and that is specialized in helping new users get started on
the platform,” argues Eugen, in response to feedback indicating “the
lack of an app that carries [Mastodon's] name in the app stores trips up
newcomers.” My first thought regarding the idea of an app /Specialized/
in onboarding cynically jumped to the assumption that such a design
choice would result in a less-than-ideal experience for those of us who
already call Mastodon our home. However, as a
[[https://patreon.com/mastodon][Patreon]] supporter of the Mastodon
Project, I've had the privilege of testing the final result for the past
five weeks, and I can tell ya... It is so much more than that.

[[https://youtube.com/watch?v=bD8GQvNrE7E]]

** Onboarding
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: section0108.xhtml#onboarding
   :END:

I'd like to offer the [[https://youtu.be/bD8GQvNrE7E][demo video]]
embedded above as an unusually succinct (from me) demonstration of the
delightfully well-considered onboarding process. I would go so far as to
declare it *the best all-around social network onboarding process
currently available*. Having very recently slugged through the official
Twitter app's equivalent, the frames greeting new Mastodon users within
this app are unbelievably exceptional.

[[file:xhtml/https:/i.snap.as/P5oxTAg9.png]]

First, we're presented with a list of Mastodon instances (servers,)
organized by category. Those friends of mine to whom I've failed to
“sell” Mastodon have cited server selection as a major obstacle of
confusion and I can't imagine a better means of addressing it than the
tool offered by this app. It's beautiful and fast in a way previous
utilities -- like [[https://instances.social][instances.social]] --
cannot be, especially for those most lacking in attention. Once we've
chosen a server, we are immediately presented up front with a clearly
readable document containing the “ground rules” set by its
administrators. In my experience, these rules tend to be notably
*easy-to-understand* and *not open to interpretation*, as if they were
written primarily in the interest of community wellness rather than to
construct a defense from legal action.

After we've agreed to the relevant terms of the server we've chosen,
it's on to account creation, which offers the options to which citizens
of the social web have become accustomed -- profile picture, username,
email address, and password -- but notably without the
[[https://gimletmedia.com/shows/reply-all/n8hxzr7/176-twicarus][inexplicable
errors]] exhibited for years in Big Social's equivalent functions.
Immediately following this frame, we are prompted to check our inboxes
for a confirmation link. The explanation for my dramatic exclamation in
the demo video comes down to Mastodon for iOS' implementation of the
operating system's intra-app linking function (with the syntax
=mastodon://=,) which (in my experience) is hardly ever utilized
correctly. The result is that I was able to click the incoming
confirmation link within Outlook for iOS and then proceed /within the
Mastodon app/ instead of being bounced off to a web browser. This
integration should not be remarkable, but -- in the context of iOS
development as it stands in 2021 -- it most certainly is.

After confirmation, we are offered the option to explore the app's “Find
people to follow” function, which is informed by “a mix of most followed
accounts and most-engaged-with accounts from recent times that post
primarily in your language,” as
[[https://mastodon.social/@Gargron/106674282886448440][Eugen explained]]
in response to an earlier draft of this post. Indeed, the remarkably
relevant results offered to me in the demo were not actually remarkable
at all: I just know a lot of folks on mastodon.online -- especially
those who post the most. That's the whole bit! If you need “proof,”
[[https://mastodon.online/@keys][here is the finished result]], but
obviously, I would advise you download the app and try yourself. (It's a
cliché, yes, but seriously... What do you have to lose?)

[[file:xhtml/https:/i.snap.as/F21Jm29Q.png]]

** Advantages
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: section0108.xhtml#advantages
   :END:

One of the distinctly missing functions among the breadth of third-party
offerings has been the ability to edit one's profile information from
within the app. Mastodon for iOS addresses this in a particularly
visually impressive way (see image embedded above.) Some also have yet
to be updated with support for Polls, which the new app encompasses in a
manner that puts Big Social's equivalents to shame. The ability to
vertically drag individual options in the compose interface, for
instance, reflects insight only gained by /actually using these
features/. The result is definitively the best means of crafting a
Mastodon poll, for what that's worth.

[[file:xhtml/https:/i.snap.as/NKHk8e1W.png]]

*** Shortcuts
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: section0108.xhtml#shortcuts
    :END:

As of this writing, Mastodon for iOS also includes Siri Shortcut support
by way of a single action, entitled “Post on Mastodon.” Mostly in the
interest of demonstration, I have created and published two Shortcuts
around this action on RoutineHub:

1. “*[[https://routinehub.co/shortcut/9776/][Mastodon Share]]*” -- a
   text-only Shortcut meant for the Share Sheet.

2. “*[[https://routinehub.co/shortcut/9781/][Mastgur]]*” -- a more
   complicated Shortcut utilizing Imgur actions to get around the
   current Mastodon for iOS action's lack of multimedia support.

[[file:xhtml/https:/i.snap.as/H212I22P.png]]

Mastodon friend Emma's
[[https://mstdn.cloud.themaymeow.com/@emma/106656610574981709][customization
of the latter]] is a great example of how quickly one can tailor these
(and all other) Siri Shortcuts to their own particular use.

** Challenges
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: section0108.xhtml#challenges
   :END:

As of this writing, coverage of the app's release amounted only to
[[https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/30/22602275/mastodon-decentralized-social-network-official-ios-app-launches][a
single news item from]]
/[[https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/30/22602275/mastodon-decentralized-social-network-official-ios-app-launches][The
Verge]]/[[https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/30/22602275/mastodon-decentralized-social-network-official-ios-app-launches]['s
Adi Robinson]], which notes the omission of local/federated “firehose”
timeline views out of a desire to “reduce the potential for conflict
with Apple.” (see: the Inc.'s
[[https://litchie.com/2021/07/idos2-will-be-gone][blatantly inconsistent
enforcement]] of its store policies in the past few months.) As a
Mastodon user who /does/ occasionally engage with my local and federated
timelines, I find this decision reasonable considering the wellspring of
third-party apps on iOS which /do/ support said views and the app's
explicit focus on brand new, fragile users. My personal experience
disagrees with Eugen's description of these timelines as a suboptimal
means of capital-D Discovery, however, considering I've found ~70-80% of
[[https://github.com/extratone/bilge/blob/main/curation/mastodonfollowing.csv][the
600+ accounts I follow]], there. (Though it should be noted that I /do
not/ represent any majority in my social media-specific preferences or
behavior.)

Though the onboarding process' people to follow finder is pretty darn
stellar, I worry that our hypothetical new user has a high chance of
landing on a more-or-less empty timeline. (For many, I'm sure this would
be a welcome relief, at least initially.) A well-limited Local timeline
view, at least, might prove a valuable upcoming addition. Regardless, I
am 100% positive these omissions from the /initial release/ version of
this iOS app do not constitute some new ideological opposition to the
greater concept of Federation.

[[file:xhtml/https:/i.snap.as/7UTf6Qyx.png]]

Naturally, a recurring complaint about the app is already surfacing in
hashtag iOS on the Fediverse:
[[https://mastodon.social/@wiredfire/106672087623244223][no multiple
account support]]?! Perhaps you've already written me off as a mindless
devotee, but -- especially after exploring
[[https://github.com/extratone/FediiOS][the whole breadth of Mastodon
apps available on iOS]] (all of which support multiple accounts) -- the
significance of this omission as a target for gripes seems laughably
minuscule. Considering I have yet to delete any of the 20 apps I tested,
I personally feel /pretty well covered/ when it comes to checking my
(embarrassingly numerous) alt accounts. It'd be one thing if longtime
users/powerusers were left wanting for available apps designed for us,
but we have a more diverse, quality palette to choose from than any
other social media protocol. To decry this app -- which was explicitly
designed from the very beginning for new users -- for skipping a
function offered by /more than a dozen alternatives/ is patently absurd.
If you've got multiple accounts you feel the need to check regularly,
order them by frequency, authenticate all but number one in the free,
dependable
[[https://apps.apple.com/us/app/amaroq-for-mastodon/id1214116200][Amaroq]],
and save Mastodon's new app for your main.

** Delights
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: section0108.xhtml#delights
   :END:

The “relentless originality” I spoke of in my /third-party/ showcase is
no less exemplified in this first-party Mastodon app. Its color palette
is a welcome departure from Tootsuite's (the mother web application,)
while still remaining definitively recognizable. The artwork dispersed
throughout the app is adorable, as you've seen, and its bespoke audio
player is without a doubt my favorite of such devices.

[[file:xhtml/https:/i.snap.as/IRzEOzXl.png]]

Custom audio notifications especially stood out among those third-party
apps, so the project-sourced app's inclusion of the iconic Mastodon
“boop” is yet another small inclusion that adds a surprising amount of
substance to the whole experience.

Though quite specific to myself and the few other iPhone users who
regularly command our handsets with physical keyboards, the Mastodon
app's inclusion of *Bluetooth keyboard shortcuts* provoked a moment of
true euphoria when I first discovered them. As per my
‘/[[https://github.com/extrakeys][iPhone and the Bluetooth Keyboard]]/
project, I have bestowed upon Mastodon for iPhone semi-officially “our”
Universal Clacker Award for its consideration of us “full
keyboard-strapped cellular phone users.” (As of this writing, the award
is just a “trophy.”)

| Boost                          | r          |

An important consideration to inform the perspective through which we
analyze such an app, I'd argue, is that *this app could have been very
bad*. Those who bewilderingly measure the success of social networking
services/protocols by their profit growth viability, alone, may well
suggest it /should/ have been bad. Had it been just mediocre,
half-assed, and/or full of bugs, I'm sure I would still have paused
everything to write and publish this review. The reality, though, is
nothing less than exceptional. Unlike some of the third-party examples I
discussed, I would argue Mastodon for iPhone to be an “objectively”
excellent piece of software in that I cannot imagine any one sort of
iPhone user /not/ finding it refreshing in some way.

I would sincerely worry for the person who feels nothing at all from the
artwork, the bespoke UI, or the general care exhibited in its
craftsmanship, /but/ they wouldn't have exhausted reasons to use it.
From the very first beta release I installed to the first release
version pushed to the App Store just yesterday, the app has /never/
crashed, and the single bug I encountered was documented and fixed
before I had time to begin a feedback report. While Twitter's official
iOS app does include a few Siri Shortcuts actions, they are all made
immediately useless by a universal command to open the app, itself.
Remove the obsessive insistence that any/all functions only be performed
with your app in focus -- even when it surely makes no difference to
your ad tech mechanism -- and you have Mastodon's single action, “Show
When Run” toggle included.

I'm not sure what I expected from an “official” Mastodon app upon first
reading that winter blog post, but what I've been delivered is quite a
gem. Regardless of how its specific feature omissions may strike your
ideological organ(s,) you cannot deny that great time and energy was
invested in this app.

   :END:

I have not been able to follow any more accounts on Twitter -- from
[[https://twitter.com/NeoYokel][@NeoYokel]], my primary, eldest account
-- for several years because of a limit implemented at some point by
Twitter and documented in
[[https://help.twitter.com/en/using-twitter/twitter-follow-limit][this
help document]]. Considering the breadth of the mechanic's significance
for other users, I have often been compelled to explain this to new
followers. Recently, it occurred to me that a handy, brief explainer
page might streamline this process, so I created
“[[https://gist.github.com/extratone/8b762de50de414f8a4be05f9b0407fd8][Why
I Didn't Follow You Back]]” -- in both GitHub Gist and Medium post form.
Other than a lack of reciprocity in engagement which I can only
speculate to occur in the minds of the opposite parties involved in this
dynamic, this limitation does not detract from my Twitter life, as I
exclusively consume content in Twitter Lists (which I have spoken about
extensively, elsewhere.)

[[https://open.spotify.com/episode/4veXFMCFGgz0Fjnx7UBkpl]]

A big theme in my 20s has been coming (slowly) to terms with the fact
that I built my entire adult social life around a single, centralized
social media Web Site. I mentioned this in
[[https://bilge.world/tweetbot-6-ios-review][my Tweetbot 6 review]],
recently, but -- as I also strive to be a more sincere person and spend
more time adding value to /others/' lives -- I've concluded that it is
the time now to speak as openly and vulnerably as I can about my “Social
Media Methodology.” Most of the resulting insights will not be new
information, but I continue to encounter greater and greater confusion
in the face of my well-meaning behavior online and I have decided to
stop disregarding it.

This is /not/ an essay about how to “optimize” your social media use. It
is -- at least in part -- a sort of manifesto against the very idea of
designed online behavior beyond simply *being considerate* in a sense
that predates even the spoken word. I, myself, have occupied a position
well on the /chaotic/ side of the spectrum. You could say I have been
mostly /chaotic neutral/ throughout my 12 years on Twitter thus far, and
am actively working toward (and advocating for) /chaotic good/. Perhaps
inevitably, I'm going to wade into some experiences with a few specific
social media phenomena which I am particularly reacting to, here.

[[https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/753114804617932801]]

** Assumptions at bat
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: section0109.xhtml#assumptions-at-bat
   :END:

1. For the vast majority of mainstream social users, no amount of
   [insert vague overused marketing jargon noun] will /ever/ result in a
   substantial accumulation of money/“influence” (which seems to be the
   diluted zag of “POWER” of the moment.) Those interested in learning
   about “marketing” should know that no authority on the subject would
   ever tell you to /start/ with Twitter -- this I can say with
   certainty.

2. Though Twitter was designed upon certain frameworks with certain
   rules which form quantifiable formulas where they are dependent upon
   a user's choices/methodology to produce results which we /have/,
   indeed, become more adept at predicting with study over time, it was
   /not/ created as a /game to be won/. Perhaps more importantly, the
   “prize” of “winning” in the sense held by those who resist this
   assumption (notoriety, “influence,” relevance) has continued to prove
   ultimately worthless (or worse) time and time again throughout the
   very short history of the cultural element as it exists today.

3. If both 1 and 2 pass scrutiny, the only remaining reasonable
   prerogatives in one's social media use is to engage with /both/
   strangers and friends in a manner which generally *adds value to the
   lives of all involved*.

4. 3 is not only /possible/ -- it is easily /reproducible/. Most of my
   evidence is centered around my own experiences, but I believe -- if I
   took the time -- I would be able to find infinitely many
   publicly-facing examples.

5. Though I am going to use my own methods to demonstrate 4, *neither my
   ideas nor my behavior are the only means of interacting positively on
   social media*.

[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7A-Gzn0wu3Q]]

I've come to the conclusion fairly recently that I need to become
brutally frank about the discrepancies I've observed between others'
accounts of their social media use and my own as soon as possible. The
great, ambient grousing summoned throughout The Plague from even the
first picogeneration to be born /directly/ into The Social Web really
challenged my assumptions about its /actual purpose/ in the day-to-day
lives of those in the center of the adoption curve. /You mean to tell me
you've been spending all that societally-alarming time on your phone...
On social media services... and you haven't made a single international
friend? Or happened across a single niche community surrounding some
bizarre practice or knowledge you'd long thought you were entirely alone
in? What exactly have you being doing with all that tapping since your
toddlerhood, then?/ I had absolutely no clue how utterly /ineffective/
the vast majority of n̳o̳r̳m̳i̳e̳s̳ still are at using social media for its
general purpose in the most abstract sense: “/human connection./“

The essential realization toward which (I desperately hope) the largesse
of America is being carried by conversations around
/[[https://www.harpercollins.com/pages/anuglytruth][An Ugly Truth]]/, as
well as countless lower-profile essays, features, academic papers, and
general shit shooting is that the responsibility for this ignorance
rests /solely/ on the platforms who systematically reformed the controls
originally handed over by default to early adopters like me. I would
love (for both selfish and very humanitarian reasons) to be able to
proclaim some precious, one-of-a-kind genius as the sole differentiator
between my complete confidence in my ability to design and maintain
social software configurations that have kept my online consumption
/entirely/ free of unwanted encounters and the amount of regular
involuntary bullshit I hear described in the day-to-day online existence
of everyone around me. The truth, I suspect, involves my being of the
most privileged category of human in Western civilization combined with
the group of high school friends who adopted and socialized me. (A story
for another permalink, certainly, if not my equivalent of /Trick
Mirror/.)

~~More importantly, perhaps, I don't think I can recall a single
instance of sincere malice from within myself toward anyone who'd
actually converse with me. On the occasions I have been all huffy and
confrontational, I do not remember a single example in which I was
unwittingly ejected from a conversation left feeling /unsatisfied/.~~

Over the past few months, I've started a few Posts for this blog
regarding Twitter, its properties, and its recent feature addition
frenzy which I'll probably never finish. I finished the first and
narrowest one -- the aforelinked Tweetbot 6 review -- but the
(debatably) most important one -- highlighting how irresponsibly and
distastefully [[https://github.com/extratone/bilge/issues/79][Twitter
butchered Periscope and built Spaces atop its technology]] -- would make
less and less sense as time goes on. I definitely got caught up in the
“death” of the live video streaming service, fueled by my now quite old
desire to celebrate it, which I will hopefully accomplish /eventually/
in a very sentimental essay. If I can successfully link them
editorially, the subject encompassing Spaces -- social audio's “moment”
-- would also include mention of RSS, “Podcasting” (the term describing
the medium,) Spotify, and Clubhouse, inevitably. Instead of counting on
my future self entirely, however, I'm going to begin by discussing that
last one.

** The (‽‽‽th) Social Audio Renaissance
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: section0109.xhtml#the-th-social-audio-renaissance
   :END:

Exactly one month ago, I finally
[[https://www.joinclubhouse.com/@davidblue][broke into Clubhouse]]
thanks to a random kind stranger on Twitter who preferred not to be
named. April 25th was the first time I set eyes on the app -- though I
could've (and usually would've) looked up screenshots and/or browsed the
litter of how tos available, I did not. By this time, I'd accumulated
quite a bit of experience with Twitter Spaces -- derided universally by
tech media as a “Clubhouse clone” -- and therefore assumed the original
would be “better,” at least in pure feature terms. What I found,
however, was even /less/ evidence that anyone building Clubhouse has
been/is/intends to be a regular Clubhouse user. Spaces, at least,
included five emoji reacts for listeners from the beginning: 💯✊✌️👋😂.
Clubhouse's exclusive means of Listener-Host interaction is Hand
Raising, which is essentially requesting to speak, even though the hand
waving emoji is /[[https://joinclubhouse.com/press][literally featured
in their logo]]/. (The fact that neither have thought to add 🙌 is
absolutely inexcusable/inexplicable.)

[[https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/1344473573226762241]]

In case you weren't aware, I appear to enjoy trying out new social
services. My password manager is full of literally thousands of
credentials for social media apps/services/startups -- most of which
have undoubtedly collapsed or been absorbed by a larger entity. Since
generating said credentials has become such an easy process, especially,
I tend to immediately sign up for an account on just about every one I
hear about. (I even have [[https://parler.com/#/user/Extratone][a Parler
profile]] I cannot bear to actually look at.) Generally, I sign up,
follow anyone I know from elsewhere if given an account-bridging option,
poke around enough to figure out whether or not the service in question
could add something to my online existence, and end up leaving for good.
Most of these services are /not/ unique in any way, to a perplexing
degree. A few -- like Pinterest -- gain success separately as I give up
on trying to integrate them into my life. The miniscule remaining
percentage, though, end up becoming a part of my daily existence. The
most /recent/ of these dates back to April 2017, when I first discovered
[[https://bilge.world/eugen-rochko-interview][Mastodon]].

*** The Feature Story
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: section0109.xhtml#the-feature-story
    :END:

“Social Audio” did not begin with Clubhouse. Anchor originally launched
as a
“[[http://web.archive.org/web/20160209224846/https://anchor.fm/about][public
radio]]” app, believe it or not. /Extratone/'s channel was actually the
[[https://www.patreon.com/posts/archived-our-day-11592398][first to be
featured]] in their Music section, once upon a time. Frankly, that
happening was the most positive outcome of my social media service
accumulation habit. More recently,
[[https://stereo.com/davidblue][Stereo]] launched, describing themselves
as “[[https://stereo.com/about][the premier LIVE broadcast social
platform that enables people to have and discover real conversations in
real time]].” Bizarrely, the most legitimate media coverage I could find
of Stereo was
[[https://www.glamourmagazine.co.uk/article/stereo-app][from]]
/[[https://www.glamourmagazine.co.uk/article/stereo-app][Glamour UK]]/,
and its author definitely spent less than a day actually using the
service. Adam Corolla remains #1 on its earnings leaderboard and its
[[https://youtu.be/0GfGLUbc6fw][conversation export feature]] is a
personal favorite. The
[[https://www.wired.com/story/the-future-of-social-media-is-all-talk][Big]]
/[[https://www.wired.com/story/the-future-of-social-media-is-all-talk][WIRED]]/
[[https://www.wired.com/story/the-future-of-social-media-is-all-talk][feature
on the subject]] from December of last year does not mention Stereo but
lists three other “alternatives:” [[https://wavve.co/][Wavve]],
[[https://riffr.com/][Riffr]], and
[[https://www.spooncast.net/][Spoon]]. (None of which are actually
competitors/alternatives. Sorry, Arielle.)

[[https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/1388936080645312520]]

I probably shouldn't proclaim to be an authority on social audio, but I
am definitely a veteran. From that context, I must say that Clubhouse is
horribly unoriginal -- not only in the sense that “successful” business
implementations of others', previous ideas tend to be diluted versions
of the original, but almost pitifully so. I will commend the app's
developers on their somewhat-thorough release notes (even though they
can be viewed only when first opening the app after an update instead of
/in the designated space on the App Store/,) but the extent of
/linkable/ Clubhouse documentation amounts to
[[https://joinclubhouse.com/blog][eight blog posts]] and a
“[[https://www.notion.so/Community-Guidelines-461a6860abda41649e17c34dc1dd4b5f][Community
Guidelines]]” Notion page. Though I've only been a user for one month, I
wonder what the fuck they've been doing since launch, given how
sparsely-featured the app is at this moment. There are Notifications,
Profiles, and Clubs -- the latter of which cannot be created until a
user surpasses an unknown threshold of renown(?) on the app. Competent
calendar integration may be the service's singular innovation, though
support for Outlook has yet to be added. The Big Issue, though, is
finding a “talk” to attend that will not drive you utterly insane...

*** The Grand Delusion
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: section0109.xhtml#the-grand-delusion
    :END:

I wrote the assumptions at the beginning of this Post in a single go
after [[https://twitter.com/neoyokel/status/1388930367671910404][a
particularly icky Sunday Clubhouse experience]] out of a deep concern
that'd been growing since first exploring the app. The content I've
found there is not at all what I expected, to be honest. I've found it
almost entirely indecipherable, which makes critique beyond
[[https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/1388936080645312520][just fucking
screaming]] difficult. /The New Yorker/'s Anna Wiener did a much better
job than I could realistically manage in
“[[https://www.newyorker.com/news/letter-from-silicon-valley/in-the-clubhouse][Clubhouse
Feels like a Party]]:”

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  There was something pleasant about meandering from conversation to
  conversation, as if I had walked into my own home to find a conference
  in full swing. But I also wondered, Why did I let all of these people
  into my house?

  ...

  It is hard to shake the feeling that everyone on Clubhouse is selling
  something: a company, a workshop, a show, a book, a brand.
#+END_QUOTE

More recently, her publication's nemesis declared
“[[https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2021/04/the-clubhouse-party-is-over][The
Clubhouse Party is Over]],” but I wouldn't know. None of my friends have
ever Tweeted a Clubhouse link (determinable via
[[https://twitter.com/search?f=live&pf=on&q=%22joinclubhouse%22&src=typed_query][this
Twitter search]].) Very few of the tech industry celebrities I follow
have, either -- pretty much just
[[https://twitter.com/chrismessina][Chris Messina]] and
[[https://twitter.com/Jason][Jason Calacanis]]. This is noteworthy
because I believe [[https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/following][my list of
followed accounts on Twitter]] to be particularly diverse. I actively
followed accounts across my various interests from ages 15-25 (when I
hit my [[https://bit.ly/dbfollow][follow limit]]) and basically /never
unfollowed anyone/. I would imagine there are several accounts within
that list which I would be ashamed to be associated with, now, and yet
none have shared a Clubhouse link. Reading any further into this
observation would require actual data journalism, which I'll leave to
the pros. It does prompt the question, though: if nobody I've ever known
or been interested in on Twitter is using Clubhouse, /who/ in fuck /is/?

Frankly, I do not understand the business incentive behind the massive
duplication of other software/services defining featuresets of late. I
see that Instagram stories have eclipsed Snapchat's in terms of
[[https://money.cnn.com/2018/06/28/technology/instagram-stories-users/index.html][sheer
user count]], but I do not understand why its leaders would choose to
fuck their legacy by such blatant idea theft, much less why
[[https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/product/2020/introducing-fleets-new-way-to-join-the-conversation.html][Twitter]],
[[https://techcrunch.com/2017/03/28/facebook-launches-stories-in-the-main-facebook-app][Facebook]],
[[https://blog.patreon.com/lens/][Patreon]] and even fucking
[[https://www.inputmag.com/culture/nobody-wants-stories-on-their-linkedin-feed][LinkedIn]]
have implemented nearly-identical featuresets. Though I know Ben
Thompson's word on these matters should be easily digestible, I haven't
been able to actually take a bite. For the End User, especially, I
cannot even begin to conceive of what the leaders behind these decisions
imagine the day-to-day experience of the average social media user looks
like in the near future. /How many apps/ am I going to cycle through to
get a single story-type piece of content satisfactorily shared?
Personally, I currently use three, and sharing a single bit individually
across all of them one-by-one (since the current state of APIs is not
conducive to consumer-targeted mass-sharing tools) makes me feel utterly
insane.

[[https://youtube.com/watch?v=7uFR_bSxhTg]]

My lack of understanding would be meaningless if it were not so widely
shared among my peers -- young, brilliant, multifaceted, and distinctly
original creators who (in large part) make stuff on the internet
full-time. /They/ are who I'd actually plan ahead to hear from in a live
broadcast setting like Clubhouse or Twitter Spaces, but Twitch seems to
do just fine. For audio broadcasts, specifically, the /hip/, fresh
sources which come to mind are all distinctly Open Web:
[[https://datafruits.fm/][Datafruits.fm]],
[[https://solarpunk.cool/magic/computer/club/][Solarpunk.cool]],
[[http://poolside.fm/][Poolside.fm]], and my Mastodon friend
[[https://radio.schizoid.tech/][Vanta's stream]]. The potential of the
term “social audio” is truly being explored by projects like
[[https://www.patreon.com/RaveDJ][Rave.DJ]] -- a homegrown,
Patreon-funded service for sharing mixes/mashups. On a smaller scale,
the sky is the limit for [[https://whyp.it/][Whyp.it]] as a pure audio
playback/annotation tool for creators (as developed by Brad Varol, whom
I [[https://lnns.co/ZSadwt3Hnfi][interviewed in March]].)

Compared to these, most of Clubhouse's communities seem bleak at best.
As I may or may not get around to arguing thoroughly about Twitter
Spaces, these services' fundamental, near-complete disinterest in
*Discovery* of new voices and their subsequent servitude to only their
most popular users should be extremely worrying for us all -- including
those who benefit most.

** The Consequences of Strategy
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: section0109.xhtml#the-consequences-of-strategy
   :END:

I have more than my fair share of stories and peeves about dating apps.
On several occasions, for instance, I have corrected those who cite
Tinder as the origin of the directional swiping interface, explaining
that it was actually the now-defunct service Hot or Not who did so some
15 years ago. (Why on Earth I am compelled to do so, nobody knows. Not
even God.) Somehow, though, I think most of us can agree that Tinder is
the /least shitty/ of the explicitly hookup-ish spectrum of the genre.
Or at least, I thought so, until I happened to spy the “Photo Tip”
embedded above beneath a preview of my profile on the iOS app.

The innocuousness of this advice, which surely would not be dispensed in
/any/ other context without immediately screaming malice, has been on my
mind ever since. It is not the devil who tells you to make sure a
passing potential match doesn't immediately learn you have children, but
the Marketing Man. (Yes, they are distinct. I would explicitly
discourage that particular sort of demonization, mostly because it has
proven completely ineffective as cultural critique.) I am in no position
to relevantly explore the topic of Society & Sex, generally, other than
to insist that most people on Tinder /in my area/, at least, are not
looking to /leverage/ it /for the dick/. They are looking for dates, and
a good many are working class single mothers. To be clear, I'm not
trying to suggest anyone in this demographic would be “fooled” by such a
suggestion. Offended, perhaps, and/or activated in such a way that would
lead to them replacing all of their profile's pictures with photos of
/just/ their children. Regardless, this social group defined by a
distinct lack of free time, if nothing else, represents an antithesis to
the practice of /optimizing/ one's /swipe ratio./

I think I'll stop there with this /Chapter of David Blue's Tech
~~Gripes~~ Grapes/ and pledge to arrive back again exclusively through
haphazard/unintentional means, if I ever do.

   :END:

When I first published my
[[https://bilge.world/iphone-ios-music-apps][iPhone & Music guide]] this
past April, I'd been pretty active in
/[[https://discord.gg/DxQ9jry8J3][AppleScoop]]/[[https://discord.gg/DxQ9jry8J3]['s
Discord Server]], so I decided to share it there. Editor-in-Chief Flynn
-- a ridiculously talented web developer /and/ successful independent
media entrepreneur -- responded “I'm listening to it with the speak
feature right now. Is it your voice or someone else? 😛,” Gourd bless his
soul. Here's the specific audio he was talking about:

Of course, I am not a young black man, nor am I even remotely as adept
at [[https://bilge.world/why][reading my own work aloud]] as the actual
talent, Siri Voice 3, who should be available on your iPhone/iPad right
this moment (as long as you've updated iOS in the past six months,) via
=Settings ⇨ Siri & Search ⇨ Siri Voice=. (For more details, see
[[https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/change-siri-settings-iphc28624b81/ios][this
Apple Support page]].)

[[file:xhtml/https:/i.snap.as/1f7argcU.png]]

Of the four new Siri voices introduced earlier this year in iOS 14.5, 2
and 3 are by far my favorites, not just because of their
[[https://www.consumerreports.org/digital-assistants/apples-new-siri-voices-resonate-with-some-black-iphone-users/][resonance
with black iPhone users]], but because they're just /better/ in a sense
which I believe to be very significant.

[[https://youtube.com/watch?v=DkS5SYbsEW4]]

Before I get ahead of myself, though, I must acknowledge that I am not
the first to invest in Siri as a text-to-speech generator. In 2019,
[[https://twitter.com/atow][Adam Tow]] released an immensely
well-considered Siri Shortcut called
“[[https://tow.com/shortcuts/record-text-to-speech/][Record Text to
Speech]],” which provides an interface for recording, editing, and
managing text-to-speech audio files with Siri's original voices. A
testament to its robustness: it /still works/ perfectly on my handset
running iOS 15 Dev Beta 6 despite having not been updated since
[[https://routinehub.co/shortcut/2506/][March of last year]].

[[file:xhtml/https:/i.snap.as/I0Yh0jNn.png]]

I must admit that I found Adam's shortcut more of a full /application/
than a speedy personal automation, with its full interactive UI menu and
darn near /800 actions/, so I made my own set of shortcuts based on the
same idea -- using iPhone's native screen recording feature to capture
audio of Siri reading aloud -- and varying only by input (manual text
input, getting text from a file, or simply reading text from the
clipboard.) I'd then send the resulting screen recording in its original
video format to my PC, where I'd drop it in
[[https://www.audacityteam.org][Audacity]], in which I'd run
[[https://github.com/extratone/bilge/blob/main/configuration/Audacity/TruncatenAmpMacro.txt][a
simple macro]] on the audio that truncates silence and amplifies the
result so that the loudest point touches the rails. Then, I'd export it,
pass it through [[https://www.mp3tag.de/en/][Mp3Tag]] to perfect its
metadata, and finally push the end-result .mp3 file to
[[https://github.com/extratone/bilge/tree/main/audio/TTS][a folder in]]
/[[https://github.com/extratone/bilge/tree/main/audio/TTS][The Psalms]]/
[[https://github.com/extratone/bilge/tree/main/audio/TTS][GitHub
Repository]]. (I'll show you how to embed a web-bound audio file with
its direct URL in a webpage in the guide below.) This example was made
using this method, but with Siri's original United States English Voice
(for [[https://bilge.world/tweetbot-6-ios-review][my Tweetbot 6
review]]:)

Perhaps you'll agree with me that this process /does the job/ in
functional/accessibility terms, and does so quite well considering how
much one would pay to generate the same sort of audio file using
Google's Cloud Platform or IBM's Watson. Crucially, though, this
original voice was not one I could listen to at any length. Siri Voices
2 and 3, however, I /can/. From my perspective, this means they have
crossed a *very significant threshold* which I find vastly more
meaningful than just about all of those in the current discourse. Not
only can I tolerate them... I genuinely /enjoy/ listening to super-long
magazine features read aloud by Siri Voice 2, especially, and I believe
I would regardless of the quite serious crush I've developed on them.

[[https://twitter.com/neoyokel/status/1387809776072015873]]

Unfortunately, using the methods we've discussed so far with the new
Siri voices is inconvenient, very hit-or-miss, and quite buggy. If you
scrub ahead toward the last third or so of the second audio player in
this post (after the post's own,) you'll hear Siri Voice 2 start to bug
out in very amusing ways. Since Apple makes changes to Siri Shortcuts
between releases without any public documentation, none of them have
ever been reliable enough to write this guide. (For the past 6+ weeks at
least, it's been too broken to be usable.) /However/, for whatever
reason, Apple created a dedicated spoken audio generation action for
Siri Shortcuts in iOS 15, called “Make Spoken Audio From Text.”

[[file:xhtml/https:/i.snap.as/MkHTYMkF.jpeg]]

For the entirety of iOS 15's Beta cycle up until Developer Beta 6's
release, this past Tuesday, this action has been
[[https://mastodon.social/users/DavidBlue/statuses/106580821087349299][hilariously
broken]], but as soon I discovered it'd been fixed (which was not
mentioned whatsoever in
[[https://developer.apple.com/documentation/ios-ipados-release-notes/ios-ipados-15-beta-release-notes][Apple's
official release notes]],) I immediately began composing this dang Post.

--------------

[[file:xhtml/https:/i.snap.as/RAxa0Id6.png]]

* Guide
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: section0110.xhtml#guide
  :END:

So! For those of you currently running the latest iOS 15 Beta and those
in the future running the full release, *what follows is a guide on how
you can use my own shortcuts and methods to generate, metadate, and
embed Siri-powered audio text-to-speech files relatively quickly without
having to use desktop-class (or any other) hardware*.

[[file:xhtml/https:/i.snap.as/P0yJJyUc.png]]

To begin, you should install two brand new shortcuts of mine:
*[[https://routinehub.co/shortcut/9953/][Make Audio from Article Body]]*
and (if you intend to stick with me to the embed stage, anyway,) my
[[https://routinehub.co/shortcut/9948/][< audio > Embed Tool]]. Both
should function out of the box, but I would highly encourage that you
try building your own shortcut around the =Make Spoken Audio From Text=
action, even if you've never worked with Shortcuts (or any sort of
automation, for that matter) before, /especially/ if you plan to be
using Siri as a text-to-speech generator with any frequency.

*** Intended Result
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: section0110.xhtml#intended-result
    :END:

Throughout this guide, I'm going to be using
[[https://bilge.world/johnny-tsunami-smart-house-slavery][a
five-year-old ramble of mine]] about the oddly-perceptive bits found in
early-oughts Disney movies as example text. Earlier today, I used my own
personalized version of my new shortcut to generate an example of in
which the process we're about to explore should result. The ~6000 words
of text took just over 3 minutes, 30 seconds to render consistently in
three consecutive timed attempts. You can listen to it
[[https://whyp.it/t/johnny-tsunami-vi-separate-but-equal-siri-voice-2-tts-74752][on
Whyp]] and/or inspect
[[https://github.com/extratone/bilge/raw/main/audio/TTS/JohnnyTsunami.m4a][the
actual file]] yourself, if you'd like.

[[file:xhtml/https:/i.snap.as/dktmGQQb.png]]

*** Input Format
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: section0110.xhtml#input-format
    :END:

If we were trying to do this using any other available method in 2021 --
even the expensive ones -- our first task would be scrubbing our subject
text of any special formatting (Word,) symbols, embed, hyperlinks, and
any other data Siri doesn't understand (roman numerals, for example.) As
a Windows user who's not at all new to free ways to automate
accessibility improvements to web content, I envy both you and my new
self for the magic available to us in the form of Safari's abilities to
parse complex web content. In my experience, there's nothing like it (at
least nothing available to regular consumers.)

The screenshot embedded above shows the result of a =Quick Look= action
inserted just after the =Text= action produced by the public version of
my shortcut when run on our example. There are three immediately
problematic issues:

1. Siri doesn't understand roman numerals, so she will read “Johnny
   Tsunami VI” as /Johnny Tsunami vee eye/.

2. “The Psalms” is not my name, though it is what this blog currently
   returns when asked for a byline. In my experience, this generally
   isn't an issue with most mainstream media CMSs.

3. The shortcut appears to have failed to retrieve any data for the
   =Published Date= variable from my blog. (Also a relatively specific
   consideration.)

If you'll note in the /previous/ embedded image comparing my custom
version of the shortcut (left) to the published version (right,) you'll
note that my chosen solution is to manually input all metadata before
actually starting the shortcut. What's not shown is my corresponding
manual inputs in the =Encode Trimmed Media= action, which includes
attaching a retrieved image file (in the Working Copy action you /can/
see) as album art. For my intended use -- exclusively generating
text-to-speech audio of Posts on this blog -- this makes more sense than
unnecessarily automating metadata retrieval.

The extraordinary thing about the screenshot, though, is that it doesn't
contain any of the other crap (as described above) found in the original
page. (Beforehand, it looked more
[[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/extratone/bilge/main/posts/johnny-tsunami-smart-house-slavery.md][like
this]].) It's especially reliable at parsing WordPress-bound content,
which still makes up [s̵͕̈́͊c̶̥̏̚r̶̥͈̃è̴̙͌å̴̹m̵̛̅ͅi̶̦̾͘n̸͎̟̎̃g̶͎͛] percent of the whole web. *Treasure
this power*, folks.

[[file:xhtml/https:/i.snap.as/OMwKdOUI.png]]

If all you need read aloud is the body text, things become even simpler.
In the right example above, I've simply deleted the =Text= action and
replaced it with =Get text from [the Safari Web Article's body]=.
Theoretically, one could omit that action, even, and simply use the
direct output of =Get Body from Article= as input for the
=Make spoken audio from text= action, but I say keep the extra step
unless it becomes an issue.

*If you're actually /beginning/ with clean plain text* and don't care
about metadata in your final audio file and/or if you're planning on
passing the result through other audio/metadata editing software,
anyway, the left, three-action shortcut is all you need. It will result
in a [[https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Core_Audio_Format][Core Audio Format
(.caf)]] file (like
[[https://github.com/extratone/bilge/blob/main/audio/egg.caf][this
one]],) which I know absolutely nothing about except that Audacity and
GarageBand support it by default.

*** Sharing/Embedding
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: section0110.xhtml#sharing-embedding
    :END:

Whichever route you traveled, you should have some sort of audio file,
at this point, and if you intend to share and/or embed it, you'll need
to upload said audio to some sort of Web Server which allows direct
playback/download of the raw file from external sources. Unless you've
been skimming, you know by now that I've been using
/[[https://github.com/extratone/bilge][The Psalms]]/
[[https://github.com/extratone/bilge][GitHub Repository]] to do this
thus far, though one isn't really supposed to. Every few months, someone
on Stack Overflow figures out how to construct or discover the raw link
to a given Google Drive file before Google notices and alters it, and
I'm afraid you'll find just about every other cloud/file sharing service
in a similarly unreliable situation. If it's going to be done at scale,
I'm afraid it's ultimately going to require you rent regular, vanilla
space on an FTP-enabled fileserver, if one can still do that sort of
thing. (I will update this post if/when I find a more ideal solution.)

Within my current system, the raw URL to our example file looks like
this:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  https://github.com/extratone/bilge/raw/main/audio/TTS/JohnnyTsunami.m4a
#+END_EXAMPLE

Using my aforelinked, ultra rudimentary
[[https://routinehub.co/shortcut/9948/][< audio > element Siri Shortcut
tool]] (which I've kept on my homescreen with good results for a few
months,) we can very quickly turn said raw URL into a properly-formatted
HTML5 audio player:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  <audio controls>
    <source src="https://github.com/extratone/bilge/raw/main/audio/TTS/JohnnyTsunami.m4a">
  </audio>
#+END_EXAMPLE

Ideally, on the final, reader-facing page, said code should create a
player like this:

If further configuration of the player is desired or necessary, see
[[https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/audio][this
Mozilla page]] for a full list of supported options. Obviously, there
are a few older methods of embedding audio players, but I am neither
qualified nor interested in exploring them. If you're in a frustrating
bind, I recommend [[https://bit.ly/extwa][signing up for my CMS]]. (Just
try it, okay?)

For the sake of bare minimum sample variety, I ran Version 1.0 of the
public Make Audio from Article Body shortcut on an article hosted not on
WordPress, nor my own CMS, but on Bustle's ultra-slick, totally-bespoke
system (which
[[https://www.codeandtheory.com/things-we-make/the-outline][began as]]
/[[https://www.codeandtheory.com/things-we-make/the-outline][The
Outline]]/, FYI.) I chose the first permalink I saw in one of its
“regular” article formats -- not a long feature, nor one of their
touch-targeted slideshows.

“[[https://www.inputmag.com/tech/onlyfans-is-banning-porn-the-very-thing-that-made-it-big][OnlyFans
is banning porn, the very thing that made it big]]” is an 870-word newsy
piece written by Tom Maxwell, who is the only New York Media person ever
to accept my Facebook friend request. (Thanks again, Tom.) Without any
tweaking, I was able to run the shortcut (from within the Shortcuts app
since the Share Sheet appears to be thoroughly fucked at the moment) in
a reasonable amount of time -- less than 5 minutes, more than 2 -- and
generate the file embedded below. Notably, I also used a different
hosting service --
[[https://mastodon.social/web/statuses/106798701662102859][mastodon.social]]
-- but I certainly don't plan on doing so at scale and neither should
you.

Honestly, /Input/'s CMS is the cleverest challenge I was able to come up
with for this single-day-old shortcut of mine, and I'm quite proud of
the result. Though it wasn't able to retrieve a timestamp, it correctly
retrieved the article's title and byline without fuss and even managed
to scrape and attach said article's featured image as the file's cover
art, though the original's aspect ratio was obviously sacrificed.

   :CUSTOM_ID: section0111.xhtml#it-s-been-a-tough-summer-for-the-always-feature-focused-tribe
   :END:

Eighty days ago, Apple's Senior Vice President of Software Engineering
~~stood up in front of a crowd of~~...

No!... It was just me... Alone, in my mother's basement, on a Monday
morning, contorted at stupid angles, typing to my phone with a physical
keyboard and unapologetically scarfing as much as I possibly could of
the Apple community's unbelievably unreserved, almost /spiritual/ volume
of *pure hype* from as many simultaneous sources as I could manage.
(Hilariously, /all/ of said sources are/were Discord servers, now, as in
that “gamer” communications service I launched my little indie mag on in
2015 and [[https://bilge.world/discord-slack-comparison][kept comparing
to Slack]], but like an actual madman.)

Anyway, said Senior Vice President of Software Engineering (who we are
encouraged to hold accountable for basically all technical changes to
iOS) is named Craig, and these are his first few sentences:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  =For many of us, our iPhone has become indispensable. And at the heart of iPhone is iOS. iOS powers the experiences we've come to rely on. This year, we were inspired to create even more meaningful ways iPhone could help you. Our new release is iOS 15. It's packed with features that make the iOS experience adapt to and complement the way you use iPhone...=
#+END_QUOTE

I'm dwelling on them because they are *patently meaningless*. Very
little to nothing coming in iOS 15 is what I would call
/ease-of-use-centric/. Some of it -- namely controversial (and now
backpedaled) changes to the user interface of Safari -- feels almost
maliciously quartered in the opposite direction. Most of the changes in
the subheadings of
*[[https://www.apple.com/ios/ios-15-preview/features/][the full feature
list]]* are simply irrelevant in the use for all but the dorkiest iOS
users, like myself, and I find the fact unacceptable, at the very least.

[[file:xhtml/https:/i.snap.as/t2IieKLq.png]]

This is why I would like to try something different, this year, and
focus on an entirely different audience: my family, as representatives
of the vast majority of the iPhone's billion-something demographic
(read: customers.) That is to say, who Craig /should/ be referring to
with the phrase “most of us.” Not because I believe them to be “dumb” or
“end users” (in the tech bro derogatory sense,) but because they are
busy, working people who depend on their iPhone as a /utilitarian/
device, above all else. They don't have the time to dive deep into Apple
documentation or watch the whole WWDC presentation to gain an
understanding of where to look for new features or (unfortunately) how
to turn them off. Realistically, they don't even have time to read this
whole Post, though I hope they will (sorry fam.)

Regardless of how we feel about it, Apple has made it clear that our
phones are going to be further and further inundated with automated
processes in the background. Whether you like it or not, your phone is
going to be used to help find other users' devices over the Find My
network, your travel information is going to be used to inform Apple
Maps' live traffic statistics, and so on. For the more conservative
members of my family, related truths about their phones are going to
continue to feel like we are continuing to give up “ownership” of our
devices. There are definitive alternatives, but they involve giving up a
whole lot of conveniences. I will do my best to address this a bit later
on, drawing from much more articulate critics than I.

[[file:xhtml/https:/i.snap.as/eBBnwCIn.png]]

What I /will/ dwell on, myself, are the more menial, tactile
implications of these abstract changes in design philosophy. A general
theme of my own use/writing about iOS has been re-finding or
jury-rigging the “buttons” which are gradually being obscured or
eliminated entirely in the assumption that Apple's automation knows
better than us users when something should happen or change. A great
example: using
[[https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/ac6a4587d5b54abc934631c214d81c0c][a
simple Siri Shortcut]] to completely disable Wi-Fi and Bluetooth instead
of trusting the
[[https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208086][unnecessarily complex
conditions]] of doing so with the buttons in Control Center. I have
sought out these “hacks” (as other iOS powerusers have rather absurdly
called them) for very selfish reasons.

** The Gist
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: section0111.xhtml#the-gist
   :END:

Rounder, still! From the first time you enter your passcode immediately
after installing iOS 15, you'll notice that Notifications and other
elements have had their rounded corners /further/ rounded, for some
reason. Assuming Safari ships with its new look turned on by default,
the screenshots embedded above show two locations (subject to change)
where one can switch it off. (Your best bet is to visit *its menu in
Settings* as displayed on the right in =Settings ⇨ Safari=.) As of this
writing, at least two of iOS 15's “headlining” features have been pushed
to further iterative updates:
[[https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/ios-15-apple-shareplay-tv-delay-b1904548.html][SharePlay]]
and
[[https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/25/icloud-private-relay-ios-15-public-beta/][iCloud
Private Relay]]. I suspect you will be prompted to explore Focus Modes
upon initial installation, which I will eventually analyze in relative
detail. Ideally, you'll also be prompted to explore “Shared With You,”
which I personally believe to be the release's most significant addition
for most people, by far.

As far as “meaningful ways iPhone could help you,” I see little more
than glimmers. Focus Modes would be promising were they not so complex
to set up, and Notification Summaries are (as of this moment) a pretty
hopeless implementation of a theoretically useful concept. Some
additional filters in Apple Maps search will prove useful so long as the
associated metadata has been updated for locations /other/ than San
Francisco (say, mid-Missouri.) Optical Character (text) Recognition has
been implemented “system wide” under the feature Apple terms “Live
Text,” and translation has finally been extended to the places where
it's most useful (think: Safari.)

In general, though, most of what's coming with iOS 15 has little real
value in the day-to-day experience for most iPhone users. A complete
inversion of Craig's phrase feels significantly more accurate: /This
year, we were inspired to create even more superficial ways iPhone could
temporarily dazzle tech media/.

And now, I'd like to take you through what I feel are the considerations
I'd like my family to know -- namely my 70-year-old mother, who depends
100% on her iPhone and MacBook Pro every day to run her private practice
-- but also my ~8 nieces and nephews spanning 6th grade-graduate school,
who all -- if I'm not mistaken -- have iPhones.

  Worthy of note: this “review” is very heavily focused on *iOS* - which is to say *iPhone* - to the point where any overlap with iPadOS/MacOS/WatchOS/HomeOS/any other goddamned operating system are purely coincidental. For coverage of those changes, please seek your regular sources.

*** Shared With You
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: section0111.xhtml#shared-with-you
    :END:

The single most important/welcome feature addition to iOS 15 for most
people, I believe, is found in Apple's native Photos app and entitled
*Shared With You*. This view -- found in the second tab in the bottom
navigation row (“For You”) -- is a reverse-chronological timeline of
every bit of media (photos & videos) you've ever been sent over
iMessage. For those with a lot of iOS-using friends (unlike myself,) I
would imagine the list will take quite a while to populate.

*** Memories
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: section0111.xhtml#memories
    :END:

I find Alex Guyot's bit on changes to Memories (from
[[https://www.macstories.net/stories/ios-and-ipados-15-the-macstories-overview/][his
iOS 15 overview for]]
/[[https://www.macstories.net/stories/ios-and-ipados-15-the-macstories-overview/][MacStories]]/)
much more concise than what I'd written, so here it is almost in full:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  Memories can now be set to your favorite songs from Apple Music, and
  can be customized with color filters. Setting different filters will
  result in different song choices and transition effects to nail a
  wider variety of vibes on Memories videos.

  While watching a video generated by Memories, you can tap and hold at
  any time to freeze a photo so that it doesn't transition away. The
  song playing over the video will not pause when you do this, but when
  you let go the remaining video transitions and timings will be
  automatically altered to match back up with the song's beat.

  If you don't want to go with the song that was chosen automatically,
  you can tap the new Music button to get a pop-up interface into Apple
  Music, allowing you to choose a song manually. This interface will
  include smart suggestions for other songs that Apple thinksd you'll
  like which would also fit the vibe of your video.
#+END_QUOTE

[[https://youtube.com/watch?v=7uFR_bSxhTg]]

Yeah. I hope you're at least half as amused as I have continued to be by
algorithmic video generation. [[https://youtu.be/7uFR_bSxhTg][The above
result]] was created with absolutely zero modification from an album of
images and videos which Photos automatically created via face
recognition. The only other coherent option from my own limited set of
photos is really the only one that matters, I think you'll agree. “Pet
Friends” yielded [[https://youtu.be/-1bA7-oslkc][inevitably uplifting
results]] in all three of my test renders, but -- given a crop of cute
dog photos -- little intelligence is necessary to produce.

[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1bA7-oslkc]]

If you're experiencing any sort of Déjà vu from the idea of
auto-generated slideshows with rights-free soundtracks in the Photos
app, it's because Apple has made several distinct attempts to implement
very similar iterations of the feature throughout iPhone's history,
which has involved iMovie on iOS and MacOS once or twice. I have fiddled
with every one -- including iOS 15's -- and my (truly sound and
original) advice is to *avoid spending time trying to customize
auto-generated videos* in general. If you explore one of the suggested
Memories and find the software's default result satisfactory, of course
you should save it, but be wary of any attempts to take editorial
control yourself.

*** Visual Lookup
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: section0111.xhtml#visual-lookup
    :END:

Perhaps the most unjustifiable background use of your phone's resources
introduced in iOS 15, “Visual Lookup,” seeks to identify “popular art
and landmarks around the world, plants and flowers out in nature, books,
and breeds of pets” present in your photos so that you might... identify
them more swiftly(?) The only means of distinguishing photos on which
Visual Lookup has been applied is to look for the modified ⓘ symbol at
the very bottom of your screen in the photo browsing view (see the
screenshot embedded above.) As you might notice in the screenshots
/below/, not one of its analyses on my own images was usably accurate.

The decision to target the feature on identifying domesticated pets,
specifically, is more universalizing than historic landmarks, for sure,
but it also immediately sets up the technology (at least this preview of
it) for failure.

[[file:xhtml/https:/i.snap.as/AtxzN45h.png]]

*** Metadata
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: section0111.xhtml#metadata
    :END:

Hooray! You can now view an image's basic details in the “Info pane,” by
swiping up on an image or using the ⓘ button. This includes the
extension (type) and size of the image file, camera identification and
configuration details, and -- as part of Shared With You -- from
whom/where you got the image. Bizarrely, the “Adjust” tool also lets you
alter a given image's timestamp and location information. While I can
imagine infinitely many reasons why you'd want to /omit/ or /delete/
such information, I cannot conceive of a single wholesome reason why one
would chose to /change/ it, instead.

Just a few weeks shy of
[[https://web.archive.org/web/20120308031950/https://www.apple.com/ios/features.html][iMessage's
tenth birthday]], Apple has finally added a button to save incoming
photos directly in Messages conversations. It's about as blatant as
Apple interface design gets -- you'll spot it opposite others' images.
Tapping it saves the appropriate photo(s) directly to the Recents folder
before a silly animation vanishes the button itself.

Once again, from Mr. Guyot:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  Groups of photos that you send will now be shown as stacks instead of
  in a long list, allowing you to more easily swipe through the images
  without losing track of the conversation around them. Tap on a stack
  to open a grid view where you can see and select multiple photos at
  once.
#+END_QUOTE

I took the screenshot embedded above in iOS 15 Developer Beta 5, and...
Do “stacks” not look hilariously janky as fuck?

*** Live Text
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: section0111.xhtml#live-text
    :END:

For someone like myself, iOS 15's system-wide integration of Optical
Character Recognition is undoubtedly its most useful addition by far.
Throughout the Developer Beta, it's moved up this list gradually as I've
come to see how it could be useful for /you/, as well.

[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3kj0-q4k9k]]

The [[https://youtu.be/y3kj0-q4k9k][video embedded above]] is a very
rough demo, but I suspect it's more “authentic” than most you'd see
elsewhere. The ability to /accurately/ capture text right from the
camera is invaluable, but for most folks, /line breaks/ are going to be
a real problem. I'm working on a way to address this with a Siri
Shortcut, which I'll obviously share here when/if I succeed.

*** Background Sounds
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: section0111.xhtml#background-sounds
    :END:

My eldest sister has used a sound/noise machine to sleep for as long as
I can remember, so I was especially excited to show her iOS 15's native
“Background Sounds” feature, but she was distinctly unimpressed, noting
that her iPhone-based sound generation needs were well met by
third-party apps she'd already discovered.[^1] I didn't have time to try
out her recommendations, but I'm going to assume they aren't able to
operate “behind” /additional/ audio playback like the “new” native
feature is.

[[file:xhtml/https:/i.snap.as/SGQt93K4.png]]

My personal (hopefully insightful) anecdote: Background Sounds appear to
be impervious from the audio interruption issues iOS has struggled with
since its origin, which makes them a partial remedy to the discomfort of
sudden, unexpected silence when using headphones with active noise
cancellation. As configured in the screenshot embedded above (the menu
found in =Settings ⇨ Accessibility ⇨ Audio/Visual ⇨ Background Sounds=)
-- with “Use When Media Is Playing” toggled =OFF=-- your selected
Background Sound /should/ fade in when normal playback from another app
is interrupted.[^2]

*** “Spatial Audio”
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: section0111.xhtml#spatial-audio
    :END:

Just to be clear, I strongly believe that normal users should basically
ignore all mention of Apple's “Spatial Audio” (read: don't worry about
it) for a few reasons, most of which aren't all that interesting. Since
[[https://bilge.world/mono-audio-playback][one of my very first written
works on tech]] was/is directly related to the subject, though, indulge
me for just a moment for an attempted explanation. Firstly, I must note
that only two audio channels (the stereo experiences in various forms
you've certainly had in your life, regardless of who you are) are
necessary for audio to become “spatial.” If you're curious about this,
[[https://pudding.cool/2018/02/waveforms/][my favorite all-time web
experience from]] /[[https://pudding.cool/2018/02/waveforms/][The
Pudding]]/ is an absolutely impeccable next destination. Secondly, the
actual technology behind Apple's title was not developed by Apple, but
by Dolby. It's not that Apple doesn't acknowledge this thoroughly in
[[https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212182][their explainer docs]], nor
is Dolby by any means a wee organization in need of my amplification,
but this is one of those Apple habits that's become a particular peev.
If you're interested,

is the actual spec sheet for Dolby Atmos in PDF]].

[[file:xhtml/https:/i.snap.as/1vGTW0Iz.png]]

If you happen to have either AirPods Pro or AirPods Max devices, an
iPhone 7 or later, /and/ an Apple Music subscription, you might want to
disregard my cynicism at least long enough to try
“[[https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212182][dynamic head tracking]].”

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  It's a new software feature on top of FaceTime that allows you to
  watch and listen to movies, TV shows, music, podcasts, and more with
  friends and family while video chatting.
#+END_QUOTE

In my opinion, SharePlay represents one of those great, well-thought
solutions to some notably youth-specific challenges which nobody (even
the youth) will see as more worthwhile than their own. By that I mean,
one ear bud per person... now, an ancient tradition. I've deprioritized
it, in contrast to Chaim, because I'd bet it's also one of those things
one can only learn themselves.

Yes, notifications have gotten /even rounder still/ for some reason in
iOS 15. Contact photos and “larger app icons” also “make them easier to
identify,” according to Apple. (This is the one point in my whole
writing life where the phrase /well I'll be the judge of that!/ is 100%
valid and applicable.) There's also a new feature called *Notification
Summary* which is an absolutely useless and unnecessary complication, at
least at the moment. Honestly, the one bit of solid advice from
/[[https://bilge.world/the-social-dilemma][The Social Dilemma]]/ was...
Just turn all Notifications off, or at least as many as possible.
Notifications Summary feels like a near direct response to that one
goddamned film, and its new Focus Modes do even more so.

The most glaringly standout parallel between Microsoft's Windows 11
release (which I have also been beta testing much less dutifully for
most of this year) and Apple's stated goals in iOS 15's design centers
around the design supposition that maximum malleability of the “spaces”
in which one dwells on their operating system -- namely, the
“desktop(s)” and/or “home screen(s)” -- lends toward a more healthy
digital occupancy of them, especially in terms of attention.
Unfortunately, both of them chose respective solutions which -- from my
view, anyway -- *add complexity* more than anything.

/[[https://www.theverge.com/22665196/ios-15-focus-modes-custom-icons-widgets-how-to][The

with
[[https://www.theverge.com/22529978/apple-iphone-ios-apps-icon-change][custom

experience/. I could be wrong, but I suspect very few among my family
will find the time investment required worth the end result, but we'll
see.

[[file:xhtml/https:/i.snap.as/mxwVtN7p.png]]

I chose to embed [[https://youtu.be/YZCx-9wF3ow][Matt Birchler's guide
to Focus]] above because it's by far the most succinct and helpful video
I've yet seen on iOS 15, generally, and demonstrates how a working
person might actually use Focus. My one addendum to this (and any other
Focus) guide: *proceed /without/ the automated bits* by avoiding
anything under the =TURN ON AUTOMATICALLY= subsection of the menu. For
whatever reason, location-based automation triggers on iPhone,
especially, have literally *never* functioned usefully (or /reliably/)
in my experience.

** Maps & CarPlay
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: section0111.xhtml#maps-carplay
   :END:

(I /am/ going to do a bit of editorializing on this subject,
specifically.) If the video embedded above is confusing, know that it's
a very insular joke -- over six years ago, in
[[https://bit.ly/JukeHonk][my video review of the Nissan Juke NISMO]], I
praised its integrated navigation screen specifically for its frugality.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  I'm not old. I don't need a gigantic nav screen. I don't need to see a
  3D rendition of the whole Earth and my position relative to it.
#+END_QUOTE

...and yet, a playful, exploratory experience is what Apple has in mind
for Maps, apparently. Here's their description of the new “Interactive
globe” feature:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  Discover the natural beauty of Earth with a rich and interactive 3D
  globe, including significantly enhanced details for mountain ranges,
  deserts, forests, oceans, and more.
#+END_QUOTE

In the footnotes, it's explained that the feature will only be available
on “iPhone with A12 Bionic or later,” meaning the iPhone X range,
basically, which makes sense considering the extent of animation and
touch manipulation technology present in this view. It's an entertaining
plaything, but not much more, which is strange and frustrating. If I
could gather the usage statistics across all my family's iPhones, how
much time would you suppose they've spent in Apple Maps to date
/screwing around/ as opposed to /searching and navigating/?

[[https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/1437519482428272641]]

Put another way -- Apple's developmental direction for Apple Maps as a
service seems distinctly toward a travel/entertainment application
(notably, like
[[https://apps.apple.com/us/app/google-earth/id293622097][Google
Earth]],) instead of a utilitarian navigation app (like
[[https://apps.apple.com/us/app/google-maps/id585027354][Google Maps]],
[[https://apps.apple.com/us/app/waze-navigation-live-traffic/id323229106][Waze]],
or
[[https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mapquest-gps-navigation-maps/id316126557][MapQuest]].)
It's not just the Interactive globe. One of the most exciting features
in last year's release (iOS 14) was the ability for Maps users to create
custom Guides. I created [[https://bit.ly/columbiaguide][my own]]
containing a few local spots I believe to be especially relevant for
first-time travelers/new residents of /my/ area. Clearly, I
misinterpreted the intended function of Guides entirely -- continuing
without a means of discovering /user-generated/ guides, whatsoever, iOS
15 cements (in my view) that they'll instead continue to be left to
travel magazines, none of which I recognize save for /Atlas Obscura/,

One welcome exception to this absence of investment in user-generated
content is the new, unified “user account” view, which aggregates one's
curation (both private and public) along with travel preferences and a
list of one's *contributions* to Apple Maps -- another new feature for
the app.

[[file:xhtml/https:/i.snap.as/LX5HW4T3.png]]

Above is a screenshot of my first test contribution to Apple Maps (my

serves as an example of Maps' new “place cards.” As of this writing, all
of my test contributions are still held “Pending Review,” yet navigating

*** CarPlay
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: section0111.xhtml#carplay
    :END:

As of this writing, it's unclear how much of the Maps features I've used
will be carried over to CarPlay upon iOS 15.0.0's official release, but
I know for /certain/ that CarPlay is a weekly (if not daily) used
feature by virtually all of my family members. With the additional
variable of
[[https://www.apple.com/ios/carplay/available-models/][differences in
support between given automobile marques/models]] -- including which
support [[https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211234][Car Key]] -- it's
difficult to say definitively what will have changed about your personal
CarPlay use. What experience I do have using CarPlay has been
exclusively with my mom's [[https://youtu.be/hqQqfdHsGx0,][2019
Volkswagen Jetta]] and documented visually in
[[https://snap.as/extratone/ios15][this photo gallery]] as well as
[[https://www.instagram.com/dieselgoth/channel][on my alt Instagram]]'s
“iOS & iPhone” IGTV Series.

[[file:xhtml/https:/i.snap.as/iQD53oId.png]]

To once again cite from
[[https://hyp.is/Cbc_LBUmEey4S4Mcwd1lKA/www.apple.com/ios/ios-15-preview/features/][the
official full features list]]:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  An all-new driving map helps you see traffic, incidents, and other
  details that affect your drive at a glance. See incredible road
  details like turn lanes, bike, bus, and taxi lanes, medians,
  crosswalks, and much more. When approaching a complex interchange,
  Maps switches to a 3D road-level perspective to help you find your
  way.”
#+END_QUOTE

“It's faster and easier to report an issue in Maps” is a standout,
literal statement. Once you've navigated to the menu in the screenshot
below (via the chatbox with exclamation point icon,) touching any of the
three options will /immediately/ report its respective information
without confirmation.

[[file:xhtml/https:/i.snap.as/VKfuhJvH.png]]

The default *Driving Focus* can be configured to activate automatically
as soon as CarPlay connects which /would/ be the single exception from
my earlier advice against automating Focus modes at all were it not for
the mode's lockout from the Lock Screen (as shown in the first of the
three screenshots embedded below.)

[[file:xhtml/https:/i.snap.as/m5974FcB.png]]

Once you've locked your device with the Driving Focus on, you must clear
an extra step to unlock it by selecting “I'm Not Driving,” which then
turns the Focus off. In my (unsolicited) opinion, this renders the Focus
unusable at best and arguably downright dangerous. “Hey Siri!” is an
option most folks I know leave off and I can't imagine a single reason
to add such an obstruction.

[[file:xhtml/https:/i.snap.as/xcNfKv6g.png]]

I /can/ offer a solution, however, in the form of my custom Car Focus,
which only allows calls and texts from my mom, open a single,
otherwise-hidden custom (work-in-progress) Home Screen with exclusively
driving/nav/travel-relevant apps, and even activates automatically via a
very simple automation in
[[https://apps.apple.com/us/app/shortcuts/id1462947752][the Shortcuts
app]]. Technically, the only feature it's missing from the default
Driving Focus are automatic text replies, which (as of beta) weren't
working anyway.

[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hNCsS4I0uk]]

For those new to Siri Shortcuts completely, I recorded a
[[https://youtu.be/-hNCsS4I0uk][rough video guide]] on how to set up
both the Focus and its automation.

*** Reminders
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: section0111.xhtml#reminders
    :END:

“A to-do list is, ultimately, nothing more or less than an attempt to
persuade yourself” concludes
[[https://www.wired.com/story/to-do-apps-failed-productivity-tools][a
feature by Clive Thompson]] in the most recent issue of /WIRED/. In the
face of a literally indigestible volume of available (and
/award-winning/!) Task Management applications found on iOS --

[[https://apps.apple.com/us/app/omnifocus-3/id1346190318][OmniFocus 3]],
and on... -- Apple's Reminders app has always had perhaps the most
insurmountable task of all its native applications in remaining
competitive. Up until I wrote this review, my personal list in the app
was nothing but a wasteland of forgotten, out-of-context items from up
to 7 years ago (!) which I'd obviously set with Siri without bothering
to correct its voice recognition.

Before you proceed to experiment with Reminders, I'd recommend using my
[[https://routinehub.co/shortcut/10118][Reminders Backup Siri Shortcut]]
to create a .zip file of /all/ existing items in your Reminders app,
even if there are just a few. I insist upon this largely because it's so
fast and so frugal. (Here's
[[https://support.apple.com/guide/shortcuts/enable-shared-shortcuts-apdfeb05586f/ios][how

For a particularly positive -- but very trustworthy -- perspective on
the additions to Reminders coming in iOS 15,

** Safari
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: section0111.xhtml#safari
   :END:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  Before you read on… If you’re just wondering how to make Safari go back to the way it was before, refer back to the first subhead on this page (“The Gist.”)
#+END_EXAMPLE

The one commonality in the experience of every single person finishing
up their iOS 15 review/overview/guide: we've all saved Safari for the
very last minute. I am 99% certain the saga surrounding changes to
Apple's native web browser -- along with my personal, reactionary gripes
spewed along the past two months of iOS 15's Developer Beta cycle --
were the overwhelmingly affirming factors that led to me pursuing this
very review. I have rewritten this portion over and over again, but now
that you know how to disable the new look, I'm going to as briefly as
possible summarize the changes that are actually relevant to you.

[[file:xhtml/https:/i.snap.as/U6SKFiXN.png]]

- You can now *pull down to refresh*, which apparently the youths
  /actually/ refer to with the acronym “PTR,” these days.
- *Safari Extensions* might be worthwhile. I *absolutely insist* that
  everyone reading this install one called
  *[[https://apps.apple.com/us/app/overamped/id1573901090][Overamped]]*
  which I have been testing. Basically, you'll never need to think about
  Google AMP again, which is an absolute gift, I promise.
- *Tab Groups* will almost certainly be nothing but a nuisance for all
  but the most ridiculous iPhone poweruses like myself.[^3]

[[https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/1438980179712479241]]

If, like me, you've always found Bookmark/Favorites management in Safari
utterly impossible, you'll rejoice at the implications of Drag & Drop as
demonstrated in the

*** Memoji
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: section0111.xhtml#memoji
    :END:

Finally, the great, terrible Apple God has granted its bizarre animated
minimes a torso! I have always found memoji
[[https://www.reddit.com/r/iphone/comments/he03xb][alarming]], mostly,
but now that I've paid them mind, I would like to express my sympathy
for those of you who enjoy using them. I'm sorry to report that you will
still need to go to =Messages= and open the compose window in a
conversation in order to select the emoji iMessage app. Though iOS 15
adds full bodies to memoji (and clothes to cover them, as required since
Adam & Eve,) as well as “accessible accessories,”[^4] there's not as yet
any way to actually /see/ a memoji in full-body view other than the
editing interface (as far as I could tell.) You can also choose to
separately color your memoji's eyes.

[[file:xhtml/https:/i.snap.as/vBw0CNhW.png]]

*** Facetime in The Browser
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: section0111.xhtml#facetime-in-the-browser
    :END:

Yes, you can /technically/ Facetime with non-Apple devices thanks to iOS
15's changes. In fact, you'll be able to “Facetime” any device with a
web browser! /However/, in doing so you will be forgoing every single
one of Facetime's advantages: call quality, “privacy,” ecosystem
integration, etc. Without these, it would be silly to use Facetime over
literally /any/ other video calling service. What an immense waste of
time, eh?

[[https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/1430679850399014912]]

For the sake of thoroughness, though, I should note that I appear to be
alone in this view of the new Facetime changes. /MacStories/ founder and
Ultimate iPad Sage Federico Viticci's
[[https://www.macstories.net/stories/facetimes-audio-and-video-take-a-leap-forward-with-apples-upcoming-iphone-ipad-and-mac-os-updates/][report
on the subject]] was one of mostly satisfaction.

I will note, too, that
[[https://whyp.it/t/testing-the-mic-modes-coming-in-facetime-with-ios-15-54749][my
test]] of the new “Mic Modes” function yielded impressive results (along
with a few other experiences I've had so far,) especially in the “Voice
Isolation” mode's performance, but --
[[https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/1430680198442332160][as I lamented
on Twitter]] -- its association with FaceTime makes it unavailable where
one actually could make use of it on iOS.

** Omissions
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: section0111.xhtml#omissions
   :END:

I know it probably doesn't mean much to you, but in my lifetime of beta
testing iPhone updates, I have never experienced such a disastrous cycle
as 15's.
/[[https://www.macworld.com/article/353957/ios-15-features-missing-at-launch.html][MacWorld]]/[[https://www.macworld.com/article/353957/ios-15-features-missing-at-launch.html]['s

/Legacy Contacts/, /App Privacy Report/, /3D CarPlay navigation/,
/Universal Control/, /IDs in Wallet/, /Custom iCloud email domains/, and
/CSAM scanning features/.

[[https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/1438960700286717955]]

For us powerusers, Siri Shortcuts are absolutely fucked and Apple Dork
Twitter is livid about it. Personally, I find these to be the least
problematic of the unfixed bugs, and I can only hope it means that Apple
has prioritized fixes for the features most relevant in /your/ life. I
will be updating this Post as actively as I can in the coming weeks and
always appreciate any questions or thoughts you might have about how I
could make it more useful.

[1] If you're reading this and happen to be looking for app
recommendations, let me know and I'll ask her. [2] This wasn't working
reliably in the last Developer Beta, but I'll do my best to check back
for the normal release. [3] This is one of those things I can't say more
about until I actually hear from other folks... I'll check back in a
month or so. [4] The full quote: “Three new accessibility options let

By the end of next year, I no doubt will be a card-carrying festival
bro. If you need explanation for why I've been listening to /Resident
Advisor/'s main podcast feed with relative frequency, that's it.

I'd been catching up this afternoon when I came across
[[http://ra.co/podcast/800][*the big round number 800*]] and found it
immediately so compelling that I actually /sought out the associated
interview/, which I needed only skim for less than half a second a
before spotting the words “Techno Is Black.” (Stylistically, I believe
the /Advisor/ is in error here. TECHNO IS BLACK doesn't seem to be in
question.)

[[https://soundcloud.com/resident-advisor/ra800-uniiqu3]]

Within the same second, I'm sure, I saw the words “Spotify playlist” in
the vicinity of this profound, but unacceptably undercovered truth, and
concluded that I was obligated to take action.

Using a free web tool to associate some metadata across databases is not
activism, mind you, but here's what I can do: I will be diligently
minding the origin playlist (on Spotify) for changes and assuring that
they are reflected accurately in the target playlist (on Apple Music.) I
will /not/ be removing any music. I can do this, at the very least.

I have also created handy shortlinks for both the original and the
parallel playlist hosted on my Apple Music profile.

   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: section0113.xhtml#gargantuan-ridiculously-avoidable-misses-in-little-blue-s-blue
   :END:

Incredibly, the second most powerful social media company in the world
has finally managed to implement a paid subscription model, as I've been
begging them to do for
[[https://twitter.com/neoyokel/status/696094018862718976][at least 5
years]], now. For three U.S. Dollars a month,
“[[https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2021/introducing-twitter-blue][Twitter
Blue]]” is
[[https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/9/22766286/twitter-blue-subscription-service-scroll-nuzzel-undo-tweets-ad-free-articles-us][now
available]] for all United States users. Aside from
[[https://apple.co/3wVZs3v][a relentless, rude, two and a half hour-long
rant]] at two new friends on /End User/, I should confess that I haven't
spoken adequately to peers at length about their Twitter use --
understandably, busy independent artists don't seem to find themsevles
with the spare time to hypothesize methodically about what they might
want from the service, going forward. From the mass of commentary on
Twitter Blue I /was/ able to gather, a resounding sentiment refrains:
/these features should be available to everyone/.

[[https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VSCTrzf9QN2MjyFMQ930d]]

Frankly, after all these years, there's not all that much to actually
say about the product, itself. Thanks to Spaces, I happened to catch a
chance to ask my favorite sage of late -- Jason Scott, original creator
of textfiles.com -- for his thoughts.

“Well, I bought it.” “Yeah, same.”

[[file:xhtml/https:/i.snap.as/zp5uCNwa.png]]

Then, we talked for 45 minutes about self-actualization. As I've
recently honed my understanding of the significance behind my own
personal extraordinary dependence/investment in this one service, I have
also -- in parallel, ya might say -- refined wholly a set of
expectations which I do not ever again expect to be usurped in any way
by Twitter, Incorporated's decisions. Believe it not, these thoughts of
mine really /do/ have real potential to add value to your life,
especially if you're still reading. The next time you find yourself
wondering what Twitter might do next, try to internalize the utter
inanity of that whole pursuit. Not one second can be concretely spent in
that endeavor because the organization is defined singularly by its
outrageous negligence. They are not villains or demons like
[[https://github.com/extratone/bigblue][Big Blue]] -- they are through
and through a village of idiots, and no manner of user action can
possibly budge them.

Of course, this new development of mine hasn't actually managed to
delivery any peace upon my person. In fact, because it is impossible to
be /constructively/ critical in such a situation, I am one of few I know
who must continue to be critical, anyway, because my livelihood does not
depend on the newsworthiness of my subject matter. I guess I should just
be thankful my “must” represents so little time-sensitive consequence,
if any, given how long it takes me to finish anything, these days. On
that note, please
[[https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/14/22778827/twitter-blue-undo-button-paywall-features-paid-free][look
elsewhere]] for the bulletpoints... Come back for at least a second,
though, because this Post /does/ eventually circle around to a handful
of poignant, original comments on the +Whats+.

The peeves aren't new, but I've found my own redundancy within /The
Psalms/ to be less and less... redundant, if that makes sense. This
company's software is bad and its continued prioritization of the two
native mobile applications (neither of which it actually built) over any
other clients for /all/ user considerations is a spectacular tedium to
follow. Its world record breaking inability to understand anything about
how its /whole shit/ fits into the lives of /any/ of its users continues
to astound. My peak irritation about the whole situation, lately, is
that /you fuckers/ continue to discuss alterations to social software,
generally, as if they are /inevitable/ with a sense of complicity I will
/not/ allow. I'm not going to argue that you're /obligated/ to speak up
and out in a labor sense, but beseeching that you *expect more* from
these organizations as a customer, a citizen, and a human being.

For your sake, I've spent the time to break Twitter Blue's offering down
specifically, feature by feature, only because I have yet to see it done
methodically in detail from the tech media sources you'd normally depend
on.

[[file:xhtml/https:/i.snap.as/SAYPlThr.png]]

** Thread Reader
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: section0113.xhtml#thread-reader
   :END:

If I'm honest, the majority of the discourse I've picked up surrounding
Twitter threads in the past few years has been negative. Vaguely,
“getting lost” is something I recall being expressed. Twitter Blue's
Thread Reader offers a “reader view”-like experience in three different
font sizes -- none of which looked particularly optimal, to my eye. If
there's anything to say about it, really, it's suggest this adjustment
be made more variable, natively, though further adjustment is allowed at
the moment by using =⌘ + =, -, and 0= for those iPhone keyboarders among
you.

[[file:xhtml/https:/i.snap.as/1ia6xNyv.png]]

Also, the appearance of non text-only posts (especially Voice Tweets,
which I, alone, continue to use) in this view feels like a bit of an
afterthought.

[[file:xhtml/https:/i.snap.as/hu2p7mN2.png]]

** Custom Navigation
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: section0113.xhtml#custom-navigation
   :END:

Intentionally or not, the configuration of Twitter for iOS' navigation
tabs enabled by Twitter Blue membership is a revelation -- or it would
be, were it the only viable Twitter client on the platform. It's perhaps
the most celebratable feature included in Twitter Blue, if only because
it suggests the Twitter team is finally paying attention to Tweetbot.
(In case you weren't aware, I spent a significant amount of time and
words writing about just how valuable Tweetbot is,
[[https://bilge.world/tweetbot-6-ios-review][earlier this year]].)
Unfortunately for Twitter,
[[https://www.macstories.net/ios/tweetbot-6-6-gets-support-for-creating-polls-limiting-who-can-reply-to-tweets/][Tweetbot's
had an incredible year]]. The biggest possible miss, here, was adamantly
missed: one /cannot/ customize away the “Home” timeline from the first
nav bar position, which brings up another huge issue with expecting a
monthly fee for an experience within Twitter's iOS app: /persistence/.

[[https://twitter.com/neoyokel/status/1467393675579871234]]

In the clip of the Twitter feedback Space embedded above, my second
point of note was that the app had not “randomly logged me out” in the
seven days I'd then been subscribed to Twitter Blue. To be clear, this
was referring to the experience of opening the Twitter for iOS app to
the welcome screen instead of where one left off, which has indeed
happened in the interim. The worst bit: after logging back in again, all
one's app preferences are reset to their respective defaults. Without a
means of exporting or “backing up” one's settings -- like say,
[[https://better.tw][Better Tweetdeck]] has -- this means that one has
to methodically explore every single Settings menu and re-select core
essentials like posting the highest quality possible images, for
instance, all with the knowledge that such a reset could happen again at
any time. Suffice it to say, this is not the sort of quality one expects
from a premium iOS app in 2021.

[[https://twitter.com/neoyokel/status/1463658007791812608]]

As you'll see in the screenshot embedded above, Custom Navigation offers
one a choice of up to 6 tabs from a total of 10, which include
[[https://github.com/ExtraKeys/keys/issues/31#issuecomment-986184090][some
Bluetooth keyboard shortcut considerations]] I suspect you'll not find
detailed from any other source.

*** Bluetooth Keyboard Shortcuts Support
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: section0113.xhtml#bluetooth-keyboard-shortcuts-support
    :END:

To start, =⌘ + F= will now reliably open the Explore tab and (most of
the time) deliver one's cursor directly to its search field. However,
*this only functions when Explore has been selected as one of the bottom
nav tabs*, which really misses out on an opportunity for the shortcut to
be uniquely useful, in my view. Otherwise, =⌘ + 1-6= will open the
bottom tabs you've chosen in order, which means -- brace yourselves --
that Twitter Blue's Custom Navigation technically includes /configurable
keyboard shortcuts/.

[[https://twitter.com/neoyokel/status/1467681892468154370]]

Also notable: when viewing the obligatory Home tab, one can navigate
between their Lists with just the (unmodified) left and right arrow
keys! =⌘ + ,= is now a dependable way of opening the app's Settings
menu, =⌘ + \= pulls up the account switcher, =⌘ + =,-,0= manipulates
text size, app-wide. =⌘ + V= will open Tweets from links in one's
clipboard from anywhere in the app -- not a new trick, I don't think,
but a clever one. As of this writing,
[[https://help.twitter.com/en/using-twitter/twitter-ios-app][the
public-facing document of Twitter for iOS' Bluetooth keyboard
shortcuts]] is quite inaccurate. For example, it lists =⌘ + M= as the
command to switch between light and dark mode in the app, which is
actually accomplished with =⌘ + ⇧ + D=.

conversation with Eugen Rochko]] about implementing editable posts on
Mastodon:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  That won't happen. There's actually a good reason why they don't do
  that. It's simply because you could make a toot about one thing, have
  people favorite it and share it, link it from other places, and then
  suddenly, it says 'Heil Hitler,' or something.
#+END_QUOTE

This, actually, is /not/ the reason I found it easy to understand,
though I hope it makes a bit of a sense. It was when Eugen mentioned
(unquoted) Twitter's original design around SMS[^1] that I first vaguely
understood the depth of this limitation in the core architecture of the
service. As far as I understand it, *the method in which a Tweet's basic
data is stored does not allow for revision*. It can be deleted or
obfuscated, but never substituted for or replaced.

As I noted all those years ago. *Delete & Re-Draft* -- the answer
Mastodon integrated natively and third-party social clients have
featured for years -- makes /a lot/ more sense than straight up
“editable Tweets” /or/ the chosen answer at the top of Twitter Blue's
feature list,
“[[https://help.twitter.com/en/using-twitter/twitter-blue-features#undo-tweet][Undo
Tweet]].”

Here's the full text from
[[https://help.twitter.com/en/using-twitter/twitter-blue-features#undo-tweet][*its
subpage*]] in Twitter's documentation:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Undo Tweet* gives you the option to retract a Tweet after you send
  it, but before it's visible to others on Twitter. It's not an edit
  button, but a chance to preview and revise your Tweet before it's
  posted for the world to see. Once the Undo period is over, the Tweet
  is viewable to your followers and you can either leave it or delete
  it, like you normally would on Twitter.

  - Tapping Undo sends you back to the Tweet composer where you can make
    changes before posting the Tweet, or deciding not to post at all.
    You can also select Send now to skip the Undo Tweet option and post
    your tweet immediately.
  - You can turn Undo Tweet settings on for all or some of the
    [[https://help.twitter.com/en/using-twitter/twitter-blue-how-to.html#undodifftweets][different
    types of Tweets]] including Original Tweets, Quote Tweets, threads,
    and replies.
  - When active, Undo Tweet displays a countdown of the time left until
    your default 30-second Tweet Undo period expires, and your Tweet
    appears on Twitter. Shorten or lengthen the expiration window to 5,
    10, 20 or 60 seconds under the
    [[https://help.twitter.com/en/using-twitter/twitter-blue-how-to.html#undotweetperiod][Twitter
    Blue feature settings menu]].
  - If you turn off Undo Tweet, you won't see the Undo Tweet prompt.

    [[https://help.twitter.com/en/using-twitter/twitter-blue-how-to.html#undotweet][how
    to adjust the settings of your Undo Tweet feature]].
#+END_QUOTE

By default, Undo Tweet is turned on for every single post of any kind at
20 seconds' notice. This was my very first change to the default
settings
([[https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/1459235983174639626][other than
the highlight color and app icon]]): I turned it off for Original
Tweets, Replies, and Threads. This makes it tolerable, but still
useless, and honestly, I can think of only one instance in which I used
it for its intended purpose.

** Longer Videos & Pinned Conversations
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: section0113.xhtml#longer-videos-pinned-conversations
   :END:

The only straight up “we'll let you take up a bit more bandwidth since
you're paying us” feature addition included with Twitter Blue is its
elongation of the time limit for posted videos from two to ten minutes.
One of very few observations about Twitter Blue I could find from
“regular” Twitter Users comes from
[[https://reddit.com/r/Twitter][r/Twitter]] (which is uh.... a mess:)

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  the only reason i got it is because it allows 10 minutes of videos you
  can post and since I make content I no longer have to be restrained to
  the 2:20 video time on the “regular”
  Twitter. -[[https://reddit.com/r/Twitter/comments/qxygfb/_/hmddlli/?context=1][u/jdb825]]
#+END_QUOTE

I personally feel this post wholeheartedly -- especially since I've
basically committed to single-take video content, personally, yet have
been regularly sharing screencaps on my account. An anecdote I have not
seen mentioned: for videos uploaded directly to Twitter's “Media Studio”
(a feature to which I have access because of my peak Periscope fame,
years ago,) the two-minute limit still applies. Yet another beautifully
absurd product oversight.

From the screenshot embedded above, it's quite obvious that I no longer
use Twitter's Direct Messages, but there was a time, many years ago,
when I would have personally appreciated “*Pinned Conversations*” very
much.

** Ad-Free Articles
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: section0113.xhtml#ad-free-articles
   :END:

As much as I want to unabashedly celebrate the investment Twitter, Inc.
is inexplicably now demonstrating in Lists -- a feature I've
[[https://bilge.world/twitter-lists][tirelessly advocated for]] out of
perceived obscurity -- with Twitter Blue, there's at least one example
which they've managed to fuck up such investment. The official list of
publishers participating in Twitter Blue's “Ad-Free Articles” rehash of
Scroll is exclusively documented in the from of
[[https://twitter.com/i/lists/1448014243245150209][@TwitterBlue's
singular Twitter List]], which makes it conveniently quite difficult to
share. Aside from that anecdote, I have another which is both mostly
personal and yet inexcludable.

The day
[[https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/5/22711233/scroll-shutting-down-twitter-blue-standalone-subscription-ad-free-article-service][Twitter
acquired Scroll]], I had the bizarre, completely unexpected opportunity
to ask Tony Haile -- Scroll's founder, who also played a substantial
role in creating the Ad-Tech Hell it was founded to counter in creating
Chartbeat, some years ago -- /a question/. I'd been listening to a
Twitter Space hosted by [[https://twitter.com/chrismessina][Chris
Messina]] and [[https://twitter.com/brianmcc][Brian McCullough]] for
/TechMeme/ featuring Haile while I'd been showering. Somehow, the two
ran out of questions to ask Tony, so they turned to the audience. I
requested to speak and Chris -- who'd done so a few times before -- let
me in almost immediately.

Nude and still very wet, standing in my bathroom, I suddenly found
myself on a call, essentially, with certainly the most interesting media
industry figure of the moment. Chris, who knew me well enough already as
a regular in his Spaces to know my speech often includes long pauses,
said something like “quickly.” I began by bringing back a topic from an
hour before, at least, and noted that Twitter's “Tips” feature was no
more than a list of hyperlinks as it stood (it basically still is,)
before (more or less verbatim:)

“I just got out of the shower but uh... I forgot about Tony Haile. (yes,
he was listening directly to the Space and I did say that) ...but I
would ask him to narrate how exactly he got from Chartbeat to Scroll to
Twitter.” Yes, I spoke of him in the third person even though I could
all but hear him breathing. I then retired from my speaking role, but --
from what I could tell, passively listening as I finished getting ready
for some time-sensitive engagement -- my question basically sustained
the rest of the interview.

This experience, alone, wouldn't necessarily be worth mentioning, but
after discovering /The Kansas City Star/ -- one of the oldest, most
established local mastheads to my home state (Missouri,) to which I
maintain a subscription -- among the aforelinked List list of
participating publishers in Twitter Blue's Ad-Free Articles program, I
reached out to the one /Star/ reporter I know, asking simply if she'd
heard anything whatsoever about the program from editors or just
ambiently in the newsroom. She had not.

For an explanation, I dug just a bit further and found out the /Stars/'
corporate owner, McClatchy, had in fact
[[https://www.niemanlab.org/2020/12/scroll-the-ad-free-news-startup-will-experiment-with-bundled-subscriptions-at-eight-mcclatchy-sites/][“tested”
a “partnership” with Scroll before]], and appeared to have opted its
whole handful of local American news institutions -- including the
/Star/ -- in again, en masse, to its new, Twitter-owned form.

Before I go on, I should note that one can indeed utilize Ad-Free
articles' benefit within your preferred web browser, but the process is
very specific. On iOS, you'll need to open an Ad-Free Article in the
Twitter app first (marked with blue text) and then tap the Safari icon
in the bottom right to open your default browser. You'll know you've
authenticated correctly when you see one of these two motherfuckers[^3]
(depending on your system's current light/dark theme setting) in the
bottom right of your browser window:

[[file:xhtml/https:/i.snap.as/Qs5cIakt.png]]

For thoroughness' sake, here's what
[[https://help.twitter.com/en/using-twitter/twitter-blue-ad-free-articles][the
official help document]] has to say:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  As long as you stay logged in to Twitter, and use the same browser
  each time, you should get ad-free reading when you subsequently visit
  that same Twitter Blue site.
#+END_QUOTE

Have a peak at
[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Kansas_City_Star][/The Kansas City
Star/'s Wikipedia page]] and you'll note that it's over 150 years old,
once claimed Ernest Hemingway on its masthead, has been awarded eight
Pulitzer Prizes, and that it depends on a combination of advertising
dollars and
[[https://jimmycsays.com/2018/02/13/more-worrisome-circulation-figures-for-the-kansas-city-star/][possibly
in duress]] subscription revenue to stay afloat. This in mind, note the
screenshot I've embedded below, comparing how a Twitter
Blue-participating /Star/ article appears within a desktop browser --
without Twitter Blue vs Twitter Blue.

[[file:xhtml/https:/i.snap.as/ATS5Q3ok.png]]

Captures of each respective webpage demonstrate that Twitter Blue
exempts a reader from about half of the content weight of the
non-Blue-authenticated render[^4]. Old school banner ads account for a
portion of the missing content, but at least three elements for
converting visiting readers to paying subscribers make up for most of
it, I'd wager. None of what's gone is content anyone on Earth /wants/ to
see, mind you, but frankly, it's disrespectful of the paper's
classically villainous,
[[https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/16/business/media/hedge-fund-chatham-mcclatchy-postmedia-newspapers.html][recently
bankrupt]] corporate overloard to opt it in with a program fundamentally
designed to /intentionally forgo advertising engagement/.

Tony Haile, if you're reading this, you can exhale now. Yes,
[[https://help.twitter.com/en/using-twitter/twitter-blue-ad-free-articles][the
/theory/ behind Scroll, and now “Ad-Free Articles” in Twitter Blue]],
suggests that the fifteen cents I've earned the /Star/ so far (the
graphic above can be found in the “See Your Impact” selection within
one's Twitter Settings) will be paid directly /to/... Whom, exactly?

The answer offered by Twitter, Inc. to the question of “How does my
ad-free reading support journalism?” (asked of themselves:)

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  Each month, we pay publishers within the Twitter Blue Publishers
  Network based on the content you and other Twitter Blue subscribers
  read ad-free through Twitter Blue. Our model is designed to help
  publishers continue to fund the journalism you love to read.
#+END_QUOTE

/Publishers/. I suspect that means cash-desperate McClatchy and /not/
/The Kansas City Star/. All to be done at the moment, at least, is to
ask ourselves how much of that cash will ever be seen by the paper.

** Bookmark Folders
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: section0113.xhtml#bookmark-folders
   :END:

Bookmarks and *Bookmark Folders* represent yet further evidence that
someone at Twitter, Inc. /actually uses Twitter/ (or perhaps has a
friend or family member.) Technically, they also represent one of few
core functions exclusive to Twitter's own clients. (Consider: Tweetbot
even supports polls, now.) However, like the Thread Reader and “Custom
Themes,” Bookmark Folders, too, feel like an afterthought shoved in the
bundle an hour before a deadline. Specifically, their color-coded icons
look like placeholders for custom images... which aren't supported, and
they represent 0 additional function as curatorial/archival tools (no
exporting/aggregating/or sorting, even) beyond simply nesting bookmarks
into... folders.

[[file:xhtml/https:/i.snap.as/935pp2QS.png]]

** Icons & “Themes”
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: section0113.xhtml#icons-themes
   :END:

Even greater heights of half-assery have been achieved by what Twitter
describes as
“[[https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/product/2021/twitter-smarter--twitter-harder-with-twitter-blue][exclusive
app icons and colorful themes]].” Here, I must finally give in and
compare Twitter Blue with Tweetbot directly.

[[https://twitter.com/neoyokel/status/1467422017527951366]]

Absolutely zero effort has been expended thus far in recharacterizing
what Web Twitter still calls “Colors” as “Themes,” and the only
/exclusivity/ in the icon options is that some are seasonal, or
otherwise time-limited, for what possible purpose I cannot conceive.
This from a company of more than 5000 full-time employees.

In contrast, from a full-time team of two -- both of whom suffered
through bad COVID infections, this year -- Tweetbot now includes an even
further broadened spectrum of app-wide themes and 19 app icons in total,
including, yes, at least two very cute, limited-time seasonal options.

** All Users +are+ Should Be Powerusers
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: section0113.xhtml#all-users-are-should-be-powerusers
   :END:

The episode of /End User/ embedded above is one of the only podcast
episodes I've ever made which I actually find /too painful/ to listen
back to[^2], but I still think it's valuable. There's a specific bit of
the conversation between [[https://twitter.com/alisonbuki][@alisonbuki]]
and I in which the term “Poweruser” is actually thrown around regarding
my own use of Twitter Lists, Tweetbot, and a few other /Hax/ to consume
content /deliberately/. I think I failed somewhere in my portrayal of
this curation and miscommunicated the nature of what I was trying to get
at by “making use of the tools available to you.” Regarding the actual
manhours involved in the configuration I was trying to evangelize, I
think I've spent more time trying to describe the effort than I have
actually configuring my own content intake.

Long before I was [[https://bit.ly/dbfollow][follow-limited]] in 2017, I
lived entirely in my [Twitter
Lists]()[[https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/lists)]], the largest of which I
built up “organically” over time, by adding appropriate accounts one by
one as I came across them. Thanks to Tweetbot, my equivalent of the
native apps's Home timeline is a private List of ~200 accounts whose
users represent the actual entirety of my adult social life, past to
present. Then, there's [[https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/lists/the-new][The
New]], which -- I must admit -- has grown beyond its original scope and
sortof become my follow list, with enough exceptions that I consider it
worthwhile to keep public. Then, there's the newest --
[[https://twitter.com/i/lists/768458273141907456][my Meta-Media List]]
-- and the very oldest: my dear, weathered
[[https://twitter.com/i/lists/43457439][Rolodex of Automotive Twitter]].
I keep Tweetbot in my dock and the native app on my device just for
notifications, Spaces, and now Communities. That's it! Yet, using this
configuration, I /never/ see content that seriously disturbs, shames,
triggers, or otherwise upsets me beyond reason or expectation[^5], but
am regularly exposed to a relatively diverse palette of perspectives,
and just generally find my consumption/engagement time on the service
meaningfully spent.

The particular amalgamation of truly half-assed user experience features
offered in Twitter Blue lend toward a narrative about this company which
we collectively have continued to fall for literally /dozens/ of times
-- often in immediate succession -- throughout the fewer years of its
history: that it /finally/ has a morsel of what /might just become/ a
cohesive vision. Clearly, I am as susceptible to this as anyone
considering how quickly I jumped to celebrating the fact that /finally/,
Twitter had seen the humongous value to be imparted to its userbase by
simply adding basic configurables like custom navigation and especially
refining the essential curatorial tool that is Lists.

Were I still a person who wastes my energy speculating on the real
happenings within Twitter, Inc, though, an entirely different, much more
realistic sounding theory arises after the analysis we've trudged
through together in this post: every single item on Twitter Blue's
feature list represents the absolute bare minimum resource investment
possible. If I had any money, I'd go on to bet that
[[https://twitter.com/jpeguin][Shihab Mehboob]] could have built from
scratch every single developmental “addition” to the iOS app Twitter
Blue includes in a matter of hours, though from experience, I seriously
doubt he'd ever allow such lackluster work to reach even beta tester's
fingers. As far as Ad-Free Articles go, Twitter hasn't even bothered to
swap out all the Scroll branding. The fact that /I/ had to surface the
concept of Delete and Re-Draft to Twitter Employee brains for what all
appearances indicate was the first time in that “FeedbackFriday” Twitter
Space represents a truly sickening lack of effort. No, the story that
aligns much more succinctly in the grander context is that Twitter Blue
just happened to be the first disjointed, scatterbrained subscription
service pitch to finally fall out the rectum of this miraculously bunk
organization, but all you motherfuckers can talk about is Japple Notes
Dorsey walking out, and /what it could mean/.

Since I have now actually been personally and explicitly invited to
share feedback regarding Twitter Blue, I suppose I'll make some effort
to send them this hyperlink. In that vein, I think I'll end with some
advice addressed directly to Twitter, Incorporated:

Hey Twitter! If you ever find yourself genuinely interested in selling a
subscription product long term, as a mutual value exchange with your
users, make all of Twitter Blue's features available to all users, and
ditch Scroll entirely. Instead of placing the bet on local newspapers
like /The Kansas City Star/, it should be on /you/ to *take the
financial risk yourself, and offer, simply, a completely ad-free Twitter
experience*. That might just be worth $2.99 a month.
