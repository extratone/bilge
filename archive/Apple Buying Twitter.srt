1
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:13,650
he's going to do so he knows best here

2
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:15,719
i'm talking about apple may be

3
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:17,640
interested in buying Twitter now this is

4
00:00:15,718 --> 00:00:19,348
a rumor going around as of late for the

5
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:21,479
past couple of days here that Apple is

6
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:23,249
in late negotiations with the people

7
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:24,899
over at Twitter trying to work out a

8
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:27,180
deal for around seven hundred million

9
00:00:24,899 --> 00:00:28,709
dollars to buy them Apple has about

10
00:00:27,179 --> 00:00:30,328
twenty nine billion dollars in cash

11
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:32,790
reserves so they have plenty of money to

12
00:00:30,329 --> 00:00:34,168
work with and try some new things out

13
00:00:32,789 --> 00:00:36,237
now seven hundred million dollars

14
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:38,519
there's a lot of money compared ibly to

15
00:00:36,238 --> 00:00:40,558
what they have and so a lot of people

16
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:42,238
questioning this now what their Apple

17
00:00:40,558 --> 00:00:44,758
should buy Twitter's that can be good

18
00:00:42,238 --> 00:00:46,169
for the Twitter users or vice versa it's

19
00:00:44,759 --> 00:00:49,377
going to be good for Apple is it is

20
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:51,149
smart move now I think that Twitter

21
00:00:49,378 --> 00:00:53,759
right now is that a growing stage where

22
00:00:51,149 --> 00:00:55,919
it has been around for a while now but

23
00:00:53,759 --> 00:00:58,978
since the latest a lot of celebrities

24
00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:01,139
like Oprah Ashton Kutcher p diddy Shack

25
00:00:58,979 --> 00:01:03,238
a lot of these people have really puts

26
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:04,260
word on the forefront because a lot of

27
00:01:03,238 --> 00:01:05,849
people always want to know the

28
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:07,590
celebrities doing the people jumping on

29
00:01:05,849 --> 00:01:09,029
the bandwagon right away to see if the

30
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:10,770
celebrities are doing and I have to say

31
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:13,408
I'm subscribe to almost all done on

32
00:01:10,769 --> 00:01:15,028
Oprah but and I definitely find a lot of

33
00:01:13,409 --> 00:01:16,228
good information but because of those

34
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:17,610
people in the coat because the things

35
00:01:16,228 --> 00:01:19,018
that they're doing actually boosted

36
00:01:17,609 --> 00:01:21,059
toward her up seeing in and doing it

37
00:01:19,019 --> 00:01:22,618
everybody's doing it now but Twitter

38
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:24,540
right now is not making any money from

39
00:01:22,618 --> 00:01:25,798
this okay is they offering a free

40
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:28,618
service for a lot of people out there

41
00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:30,299
and right now they really haven't found

42
00:01:28,618 --> 00:01:32,069
out a way to actually get some ads

43
00:01:30,299 --> 00:01:34,199
incorporated in here somehow that's not

44
00:01:32,069 --> 00:01:35,548
intrusive to the users and start making

45
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:37,170
some money off of it kind of like

46
00:01:35,549 --> 00:01:39,749
facebook facebook didn't have no ads in

47
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:41,400
the beginning but now it has millions

48
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:43,619
and millions and millions of users and

49
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:45,270
now has to find some way to support all

50
00:01:43,618 --> 00:01:46,888
these people because once you get you

51
00:01:45,269 --> 00:01:49,047
know millions of people you have to find

52
00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:51,809
some way to maintain your service and it

53
00:01:49,049 --> 00:01:54,329
does cost money to do so alpha bind them

54
00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:56,159
would I don't honestly don't think it

55
00:01:54,328 --> 00:01:59,547
would hurt Apple you know but I don't

56
00:01:56,159 --> 00:02:00,569
think it there I don't know at what type

57
00:01:59,549 --> 00:02:03,060
of direction they're going to want to

58
00:02:00,569 --> 00:02:04,708
take Twitter in you know I think it

59
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:06,600
might be a good match because Apple is a

60
00:02:04,709 --> 00:02:08,758
very simple company they want their

61
00:02:06,599 --> 00:02:11,429
parts to be simple but sleek and sexy

62
00:02:08,758 --> 00:02:13,139
and powerful and twitter is the most

63
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:15,269
simple you can get as far as updating

64
00:02:13,139 --> 00:02:17,308
your friends and family just using the

65
00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:18,810
180 characters I believe or less and

66
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:20,790
just let me know in about one or two

67
00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:22,410
sentences what you're doing and so it

68
00:02:20,789 --> 00:02:23,759
could be a good transition now I don't

69
00:02:22,409 --> 00:02:25,918
think that they'll actually do it to be

70
00:02:23,759 --> 00:02:27,299
honest I think the available partners

71
00:02:25,919 --> 00:02:29,909
spend that seven hundred million dollars

72
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:31,349
elsewhere to make a better product or

73
00:02:29,909 --> 00:02:33,598
just keep that money in the reserves for

74
00:02:31,348 --> 00:02:34,767
a rainy day but would definitely see an

75
00:02:33,598 --> 00:02:36,839
apple has also been rumored about

76
00:02:34,769 --> 00:02:39,629
getting EA Sports my EA sports but

77
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:41,819
Electronic Arts which is EA sports but

78
00:02:39,628 --> 00:02:43,469
by the domain company Electronic Arts

79
00:02:41,818 --> 00:02:46,529
now they do have a good relationship

80
00:02:43,469 --> 00:02:48,539
again we really don't know that I don't

81
00:02:46,530 --> 00:02:50,099
think that's a good plausible move for

82
00:02:48,539 --> 00:02:52,139
Apple but you never know in these days

83
00:02:50,098 --> 00:02:54,538
we'll see and definitely any of these

84
00:02:52,139 --> 00:02:56,339
two things are actually possible and

85
00:02:54,539 --> 00:02:58,678
actually happen we'll probably more

86
00:02:56,340 --> 00:03:00,179
likely hear that WWDC alright so Joe

87
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:02,519
