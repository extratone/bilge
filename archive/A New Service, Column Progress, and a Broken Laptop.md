# A New Service, Column Progress, and a Broken Laptop

(Archived from Revue.)

Hey friends,

Considering that TinyLetter is ugly and just about dead, I've moved this little letter to Revue. It's been a month since I last checked in with progress on *Blimp's Burden* and my own column. I've since landed an ultra-demeaning job at a grocery store (for which I am very overqualified) to pay the bills, but I've continued web and writing work as much as possible.

I put an unfortunate hitch in my progress at the beginning of the month when I [tripped over my laptop's power cord](http://www.extratone.com/shife/laptop-disabled-even-speedier-tone/), breaking its charging port, which I then [failed to replace](http://www.extratone.com/shife/to-watch-beloved-le-mans-24-hour-endurance-race-whiny-bitch-turns-to-javaos/) a few days ago. Hawthorn's allowed me to use her super-cool Lenovo ThinkPad in the interim, but it goes without saying that I am Quite Distressed about having to take my own machine to a shop.

Last week, I finished [a gargantuan dive into The State of Word Processing](http://bit.ly/textinred) which will only be interesting to the biggest writing nerds, but I'm certainly glad to have finally knocked out the topic, personally. Now, I'm working on an examination of our relationship with Bandcamp and its power as the definitive independent music distribution platform for a whole decade, now. Those musicians and producers among you, I'd really love to [hear your thoughts](http://www.extratone.com/shife/what-has-bandcamp-done-for-you-as-an-artist/).

Otherwise - though the laptop thing has been driving me somewhat insane - I made what I'd consider good personal progress when I [deleted more than 6000 old pictures off of my phone](http://www.extratone.com/shife/cleaning-old-photos-for-the-health-of-both-hard-disk-and-soul/) on Monday. I’m going to make a point to use my phone’s stellar camera to replace them with images from my new life.

In other areas, I’m not doing so well looking forward: I’ve revived our Anchor account and begun reviewing old Drycast episodes on Extratone Radio - which you can now subscribe/listen to just about anywhere.

As I’ve already expressed a great many of the pieces on my todo list, I’m looking forward to resuming work on *Blimp’s Burden* soon.

Until next time,

David
