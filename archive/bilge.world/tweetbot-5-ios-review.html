Considering my use of Git as a means to track revisions on my own writing, it's important to note that you should feel free to replace all instances of "software" in the above statement with "words," "writing," "expression," etc.

While I appreciate tremendously the work and contribution of [Arlo Bendiken](https://ar.to/2010/01/set-your-code-free) in the form of The Unlicense, I would like to add that I see no need, personally, to make the refutation of Intellectual Property law regarding my own work into some profound ethical statement. As it stands, I have not to my knowledge been the victim of any sort of theft of any kind, and find the suggestion highly unlikely. If I *am*  made aware of such a case, there is certainly a possibility that I may change my mind on this issue, so I suppose I should highlight that **THESE TERMS ARE SUBJECT TO CHANGE**, though I suspect I would be more flattered and/or amused than actually offended. 

I would also like to annotate that my use of this license should not be regarded as a suggestion that anyone else follow my example, or that I "believe in" taking such action regarding one's work, generally. While I did indeed take the time to set up [a repository](https://github.com/extratone/eoi) of John Perry Barlow's "[The Economy of Ideas](https://www.wired.com/1994/03/economy-ideas/)" in a bunch of different document formats, I do not necessarily agree with all of what he argued, especially in the context of the world 27 years later. If you *are* particularly interested in my opinion on the matter for whatever reason, here is what I have to say to you:

The principled beginning of The Open Web was a great moment in history, but - like all historical principles - it is extremely important that we consider *context* and maintain an appropriate level of criticism when looking back on old manifestos written by old white guys. In general, try your best to *be reasonable*.

</audio></p>

<p>On Win­dows XP bal­lot day, I spent <em>my</em> beat­nik-ass time mar­veling at the (seem­ing­ly) abrupt avail­abil­i­ty of some gen­uine­ly inno­v­a­tive social apps on the Apple App Store for the first time since iOS 7(?) Of course, I am aware that rea­son­able peo­ple would regard a “sneak peek,” NDA-vio­lat­ing, per­fect­ly Adobe Pre­miered app review to be pret­ty fuck­ing lame, and I won’t dis­pute any accu­sa­tions to the tune of “just an insane white guy with a Word­Press site,” but I still believe it’s impor­tant to talk about soft­ware <em>espe­cial­ly</em> because vir­tu­al­ly every­one uses it (as opposed to qui­et­ing down just when these apps and the peo­ple who make them attain the most advan­ta­geous pos­si­ble posi­tion to fuck the whole world.)</p>

<p>That said, I’m going to keep this as brief and unre­vi­sion­ist as I can: Tweetbot’s <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2018/10/18/tweetbot-true-dark-mode-gifs/">lat­est iter­a­tion</a> may actu­al­ly jus­ti­fy the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Tweetbot/">ded­i­cat­ed sub­red­dit</a> I’ve just dis­cov­ered! (Reddit’s the last place any­one wants to talk about apps, I guess.) I’ve com­plained at length about Twitter’s increas­ing­ly hos­tile (but <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/25/17274828/twitter-earning-q1-2018-profit-user-growth">jus­ti­fied, sortof</a>) treat­ment of its once <a href="https://mashable.com/2009/05/02/twitter-iphone-apps/#S_O.z..2mqqJ">aston­ish­ing­ly diverse land­scape of third-par­ty clients and tools</a>, yet I’d hon­est­ly grown sig­nif­i­cant­ly in accept­ing that the dynam­ic would nev­er again see the pow­er of the world’s most cash-stuffed com­pa­nies deliv­ered into the sweaty hands of small, kooky one and two-man teams, and it <em>nev­er</em> would’ve occurred to me that Tweet­bot was still around — much less get­ting ready to update its trusty old app with a release that would sud­den­ly make it clear­ly more sta­ble <em>and</em> bet­ter-look­ing than its last com­peti­tor: <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/twitter/id333903271?mt=8">the Native Fuck, itself</a>, which has also under­gone <a href="https://www.searchenginejournal.com/twitter-redesigns-ios-app-for-one-handed-scrolling/276541/">sig­nif­i­cant cos­met­ic surgery</a>, recent­ly. Name­ly, they moved the <em>one fuck­ing but­ton</em> that’s giv­en the app a usabil­i­ty pre­mi­um over its mobile web-based low-rent clone.</p>

<p>“The com­pose but­ton has been moved to the bot­tom right-hand cor­ner and “floats” as users scroll down their time­line. That means the but­ton is always avail­able to quick­ly send a tweet when the mood strikes.”</p>

<p>Yeah okay, <em>Matt</em>.</p>

<blockquote><p>We’ve got a shiny, new com­pose but­ton to unveil on Twit­ter for iOS! Eas­i­er than ever to use, the float­ing icon is promi­nent­ly dis­played and per­fect for one-hand­ed scrolling and Tweet com­pos­ing. Pro tip: Press and hold the icon to access your drafts, pho­tos, and the GIF gallery.
-<a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1057726896765423616">@Twit­terSup­port</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Twit­ter Sup­port is no <a href="http://twitter.com/cher">@Cher</a>, yeah, but it seems strange that less than a thou­sand of Twitter’s <a href="http://bilge.world/media/birdearn.pdf">more than 300 mil­lion month­ly users</a> would both­er to engage with the announce­ment of a sig­nif­i­cant fun­da­men­tal change to its infra­struc­ture. Imag­ine if the fed­er­al gov­ern­ment announced via White House press con­fer­ence that every stop­light in the Unit­ed States was going to have its yel­low light removed to “stream­line work­flow” with­out any fur­ther expla­na­tion, yet only 1000 <em>total</em> Amer­i­cans even both­ered to tune in to the tele­vi­sion cov­er­age across all the news net­works. It’d be strange, yeah? Well, y’all are using Twit­ter more than you’re dri­ving, I’ll bet. Next time, <strong>get out and</strong> <a href="https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/1062859883211620352">vote on my Twit­ter poll</a>, you fascist!</p>

<p>In my Twit­ter glo­ry days — that is, when I used to spend the entire­ty of every one of my com­mu­ni­ty col­lege class­es Tweet­ing from my phone — there was a healthy offer­ing of third-par­ty clients on both mobile and desk­top that filled the eng­lish of the era’s soft­ware media with an absolute­ly bar­bar­ic brand-beat­en pile of lin­guis­tic Twit­trash. After Twin­kle — one of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2008/07/17/twinkle-another-twitter-client-in-app-store/">ear­li­est and ugli­est</a> ways to use Twit­ter ever — you’d have to choose between Twit­pic, Tweet­deck, Twit­ter­counter, Twit­ter­feed, Twhirl, Twit­turly, Twt­poll, Retweet­ist, Tweepler, Hel­lotxt, Twit­dom, Tweetscan, Tweet­burn­er, Tweet­vi­sor, Twit­ter­vi­sion, Twibs, Twistori, and Twit­bin. These are just a few I picked up from a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2009/02/19/the-top-20-twitter-applications/">10-year-old</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2009/02/19/the-top-20-twitter-applications/"><em>TechCrunch</em></a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2009/02/19/the-top-20-twitter-applications/">report</a> list­ing the top 21 Twit­ter appli­ca­tions by traf­fic.</p>

<h3 id="twibs"><strong><em>Twibs</em></strong></h3>

<p>Now, I have to stop myself from dig­ging too deep here and attempt­ing some­thing absurd like <em>The His­to­ry of Twit­ter Clients</em>, but the fuck­ing mate­r­i­al is there! I could spend an entire after­noon going through YouTube search­es and gad­get blogs because it brings me back to that time when I lived every day assum­ing these things were going to con­tin­ue to aston­ish for my entire adult­hood. So many incred­i­ble ideas! <em>How­ev­er,</em> I’m going to save them for lat­er and focus on the cream of the crop, so to speak: <strong>Twit­terif­ic</strong> and <strong>Tweet­bot</strong>, which has been a long­time favorite of mine. As I said, it was in com­mu­ni­ty col­lege that I first ponied up mon­ey for Tweet­bot 3 on my iPhone 4S sim­ply because the hype over it among app and gad­get nerds was <em>so bonkers</em> that it man­aged to spill over into my life, despite the fact that iOS7 and I were hav­ing seri­ous issues in our mar­riage.</p>

<p>If you trust Mark Wat­son with your life as I do, you’d bet­ter believe that Tweet­bot has been “<a href="https://youtu.be/DE1YHcoPxMk">a scream­er</a>” since its very begin­ning, when it pio­neered the <em>Pre­mi­um Poweruser</em> seg­ment, for which a demo­graph­ic appar­ent­ly still exists. It was <em>fast</em>, yet always notice­ably smoother than the native app, just as the newest release is today. I must point out, though, that the blog­gers and YouTu­bers who’ve insist­ed that Tweet­bot or Twit­ter­rif­ic or any oth­er pre­mi­um app could replace the native Twit­ter app entire­ly on iPhone even before they were stripped of a most live/push func­tion­al­i­ty (which I’ll come back around to in just a moment,) are undoubt­ed­ly lying to them­selves — as good as they got, they nev­er over­took Twitter’s own app in imme­di­a­cy terms, which is almost inevitably going to present fun­da­men­tal deter­rence on the part of the active Twit­ter user who intends to rid them­selves of the default pedes­tri­an avenue of admin­is­tra­tion. Tweet­bot solved a lot of things, it real­ly is <em>daft</em> when it comes to noti­fi­ca­tions. It wouldn’t be the end of the world if they came a few hun­dred sec­onds late — it’s that they’re nev­er pre­dictably or con­sis­tent­ly so, which sev­ers entire­ly the human per­cep­tion of engaged <em>plugged-in-ness</em>, if you will. It’s the same phe­nom­e­na Chuck Kloster­man explores best in the con­text of DVRing live sports to watch lat­er.</p>

<blockquote><p>It’s dif­fi­cult to project fic­tion­al sce­nar­ios that are more oblique and unex­pect­ed than the cra­zi­est moments from real­i­ty. We all under­stand this. And that under­stand­ing is at the core of the human attrac­tion to live­ness. We don’t crave live sport­ing events because we need imme­di­a­cy; we crave them because they rep­re­sent those (increas­ing­ly rare) cir­cum­stances in which the entire spec­trum of pos­si­bil­i­ty is in play.
-“<a href="http://grantland.com/features/space-time-dvr-mechanics">Space, Time, and DVR Mechan­ics</a>” by Chuck Kloster­man</p></blockquote>

<p>Tweet­bot is unques­tion­ably a more thor­ough envi­ron­ment in which to explore Twit­ter than any oth­er third par­ty client, but it can’t do the live thing. (Please do com­plain to Twit­ter, Inc. about the API sit­u­a­tion if you’re so inclined, though.) All I’m try­ing to say is, <strong>there is no fuck­ing rea­son you’d delete the Twit­ter app</strong> — hide it away in a fold­er and nev­er ever open it again if it dis­gusts you so, but leave its noti­fi­ca­tions set­tings on so that it can keep itself busy in there. Now <em>that</em> is a smart work­flow! In fact, it was mine! And it did work for such a long time that you’d prob­a­bly for­get about the arrange­ment in no time were there not the occa­sion­al obvi­ous dis­crep­an­cies between Tweetbot’s Mention’s tab and the native app’s instant noti­fi­ca­tions. There has nev­er been — nor will there be, I think — a client for Twit­ter that can replace <em>some</em> use of its own prop­er­ties.</p>

<p>I think Tweet­bot 3 <em>made</em> me into my own ridicu­lous equiv­a­lent of a “poweruser.” Things are a lit­tle hazy now, but I know that I depart­ed my main Twit­ter account just before the app’s release, and I didn’t come back until 2015. I was going to school in the same old mall build­ing that housed the tool store in which I was also work­ing in full-time, which is sure­ly the only expla­na­tion for the shame­less­ness I demon­strat­ed in bring­ing a wire­less Apple Blue­tooth key­board to my class­es and plac­ing it behind the phone on what­ev­er sur­face was in front of me so that I could lean for­ward and type into iOS with my nose damned near touch­ing the screen. Strange­ly, I was not able to ver­i­fy when Blue­tooth key­board sup­port was added to iOS, but we’re going to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/iphone/comments/9y1bjd/when_was_support_for_bluetooth_keyboards/">con­clude for the sake of con­ve­nience</a> that it was first includ­ed in the imme­di­ate pre­de­ces­sor to the iPhone 4S I was using then.</p>

<blockquote><p>The cognoscen­ti have been on Twit­ter for years now. Stephen Fry, the web service’s patron saint — in Britain at least, joined in 2008. How­ev­er, it wasn’t until ear­ly 2009, xsome­where around the time that Fry tweet­ed while stuck in a lift, that the ser­vice went tru­ly main­stream. Men­tions of Twit­ter, usu­al­ly involv­ing celebri­ties, could be found in news­pa­pers and on break­fast tele­vi­sion.

<p>If you’ve made it this far, you’ve already seen the demos and skimmed reviews at least. You should know by now whether or not Tweet­bot 5 is worth it to you in pure­ly func­tion­al terms, but I think we should all acknowl­edge that <strong>this release of Tweet­bot is like­ly the last com­pet­i­tive third-par­ty Twit­ter app for iOS</strong>. The mess that is Twit­ter, Inc. has <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/official/en_us/topics/product/2018/investing-in-the-best-twitter-experience-for-you.html">made clear this year</a> that it intends to pri­or­i­tize its own clients over main­tain­ing the APIs nec­es­sary for oth­ers to receive push noti­fi­ca­tions. And when I say “its own,” I’m also refer­ring to our dear­est <a href="https://youtu.be/EHDOQVAQzec">Tweet­Deck</a>, which they in fact <em>absorbed</em>. From a busi­ness per­spec­tive, it makes sense: only “six mil­lion App Store and Google Play users installed the top five third-par­ty Twit­ter clients between Jan­u­ary 2014 and July 2018,” <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/08/17/6-million-users-had-installed-third-party-twitter-clients/">accord­ing to <em>TechCrunch</em></a>. I nev­er expect­ed to see Tweet­bot on the App Store charts again, nor would I have con­sid­ered that <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/echofon-for-twitter/id286756410?mt=8">Echophon</a>, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/tweetcaster-for-twitter/id420792544">Tweet­Cast­er</a> or <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/twitterrific-tweet-your-way/id580311103">Twit­ter­rif­ic</a> would have been left avail­able. They’re on the App Store, at least, and I can con­firm that they all tech­ni­cal­ly <em>still work</em>, but it’s safe to say they’re show­ing their fuck­ing age. Tweet­bot and Twit­ter­rif­ic, though, are not just satel­lite prod­ucts of the plat­form — they <em><a href="https://furbo.org/2011/03/11/twitterrific-firsts/">lit­er­al­ly built it</a></em>. These two are the poles that have spent Twitter’s life­time thus far demon­strat­ing for the com­pa­ny and its user­base their own respec­tive inter­pre­ta­tions of a mobile social appli­ca­tion. Today, they are unit­ed — along with <a href="http://klinkerapps.com/talon-overview/">Talon</a> and <a href="https://www.tweetings.net/apps/">Tweet­ings</a> — in a <a href="http://apps-of-a-feather.com/">plea for con­tin­ued access</a> to the plat­form they helped estab­lish on behalf of Twit­ter users and devel­op­ers around the world.</p>

<p>Both Tweet­bot and Twit­ter­rif­ic are in their 5th ver­sions, and nei­ther has actu­al­ly changed much since iOS 7. (Twit­ter­rif­ic appears to still be in the same ver­sion num­ber.) Fac­ing the grow­ing walls around the ser­vice, one strug­gles to imag­ine them sur­viv­ing more than one or two iOS releas­es, but <a href="https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/712292559058444288">I’ve been wrong before</a>. (In fact, I dis­cov­ered yes­ter­day that Look­book is <a href="https://lookbook.nu/mom">still around some­how</a>.) By the time iOS 7 came around, the new native Twit­ter app still <a href="https://www.cultofmac.com/246067/twitter-for-ios-7-released-with-new-design-icon-on-iphone-and-ipad/">looked fuck­ing ter­ri­ble</a>. When Tap­bots <a href="https://mashable.com/2013/10/24/tweetbot-3-for-iphone-review/#SDbMxlCvFPqx">released Tweet­bot 3</a>, every­thing about its visu­al expe­ri­ence was beyond any­thing we’d seen on the iPhone before and its effec­tive­ness as a Twit­ter tool was imme­di­ate­ly rec­og­niz­able in con­trast with even Jack’s brand-new app and mobile web expe­ri­ence. The ani­ma­tions were taste­ful and smooth and the “pro user” label on Tapbot’s demo­graph­ic allowed them to ful­ly explore the func­tion­al­i­ty of iPhone’s ges­tures sep­a­rate any bond with the hypo­thet­i­cal­ly least-capa­ble user.</p>

<p>This is a dynam­ic which I am appar­ent­ly unable to avoid across just about all of my sub­jects — includ­ing <a href="http://extratone.com/freq">dig­i­tal media</a> — so you may take it as gen­er­al­ly unrea­son­able or extreme, but I’m near­ly as tired of being treat­ed as an idiot <em>user</em> as I am an idiot <em>read­er</em>. <em>Read­abil­i­ty</em> is to <em>Usabil­i­ty</em>, etc. It’s espe­cial­ly aggra­vat­ing when I <em>could</em> do so much more if devel­op­ers would just assume I’m capa­ble of any knowl­edge acqui­si­tion or intel­lec­tu­al growth what­so­ev­er. Except for a few left­over key­board short­cuts, the native Twit­ter app’s only func­tion are the most obvi­ous to engage with, as per the high­est pos­si­ble stan­dards of use, which would make per­fect sense if it was paired with com­pe­tent invest­ments in <em>Acces­si­bil­i­ty</em>, but Twit­ter always appears to <a href="https://theoutline.com/post/2458/there-are-still-some-people-on-twitter-who-don-t-have-280-characters?amp=&zd=1&zi=zbzf6tkp">detest the sub­ject</a>, even while qui­et­ly putting in some of the work. Thanks to Mastodon’s explic­it and vis­i­ble acknowl­edge­ment of acces­si­bil­i­ty by way of just one young Ger­man man and a vol­un­teer team, we cer­tain­ly know it’s <em>not</em> because it’s an expen­sive one at all. (The “if Mastodon can do it than Twit­ter can <em>def­i­nite­ly</em> fuck­ing do it” argu­ment can be expand­ed almost with­out lim­it.)</p>

<blockquote><p>Some­where out there is a social media man­ag­er using a screen read­er whose pro­fes­sion­al­ism has been under­mined by the belief that the update is avail­able to every­one. We deserve equal access to the tools our peers take for grant­ed, and the secu­ri­ty to know that we will be able to do our jobs tomor­row regard­less of updates.
-Kit Englard for <em><a href="https://theoutline.com/post/2458/there-are-still-some-people-on-twitter-who-don-t-have-280-characters">The Out­line</a></em></p></blockquote>

<p>I would like to com­mend myself now for mak­ing it this far with­out men­tion­ing <strong>Lists</strong> — a sub­ject which I’ve already <a href="https://twitter.com/i/moments/996616971880882176">Tweet­ed</a> and <a href="http://www.extratone.com/tech/lists/">writ­ten</a> about exten­sive­ly — but this time, I have the won­drous bless­ing of two pre­miere mobile soft­ware com­pa­nies who rec­og­nized the poten­tial pow­er in list func­tion­al­i­ty to dis­pel or avoid most of the inher­ent risks assigned to the usage of a social net­work like Twit­ter and bet heav­i­ly on it. Nei­ther can be uti­lized to the fullest with­out lists and <em>wouldn’t it be such a shame</em> to not get your money’s worth? Tap­bots expand­ed their cura­tive abil­i­ty tremen­dous­ly by adding cus­tomiz­able fil­ters to any time­line in Tweet­bot, allow­ing the user to infi­nite­ly manip­u­late incom­ing posts with any com­bi­na­tion of every vari­able sup­port­ed by the core Twit­ter code itself. With­in a mat­ter of sec­onds, you could cre­ate a fil­ter that will exclude all Tweets except for those from unver­i­fied accounts that men­tion “blimps” and include a media attach­ment and apply this fil­ter to any of the app’s time­line views — includ­ing Home, Men­tions, Pro­file (your own Tweets,) your Favorites, and your Search­es — every­thing but your Direct Mes­sages can be sort­ed this way.</p>

<p>Tweet­Bot and I accom­plished a lot of sort­ing togeth­er, and it wouldn’t have occurred to me had it not crept to #1 Paid Social App again a few weeks ago that per­haps <a href="http://www.extratone.com/tech/lists/">my bias towards Twit­ter lists</a> could be entire­ly attrib­uted to my ear­ly use of Tweet­Bot and Twit­ter­rif­ic, which allowed me to amass a <a href="https://twitter.com/neoyokel/following">Fol­low­ing count</a> of over 5000 with­out phys­i­cal­ly per­ish­ing or men­tal­ly dis­in­te­grat­ing to the point of unde­ni­able insan­i­ty. How­ev­er, by the time <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/10/1/9432291/tweetbot-4-ipad-iphone-available">Tweet­Bot 4 was released</a> in 2015, it had long since swapped places with the native app with­in my iPhone’s home­screens and was only used when I felt par­tic­u­lar­ly like Tweet­storm­ing from a sta­tion­ary sit­u­a­tion. From my wire­less Apple Key­board, this meant Cmd (⌘)-N to com­pose a Tweet and ⌘-Enter to send it.</p>

<p>Today — <a href="https://www.macstories.net/reviews/tweetbot-5-for-ios-brings-a-redesign-dedicated-giphy-support-and-a-new-dark-mode/">in Tweet­bot 5</a> — this con­tin­ues to be a tried-and-true method of Tweet­ing Tweets on Twit­ter, smooth­ly and effi­cient­ly, as always. Return­ing to Ye Olde Alter­na­tive in 2018 yields both famil­iar <em>and</em> new­ly-imple­ment­ed goods: ani­ma­tion and audio noti­fi­ca­tions are car­ried over and/or updat­ed as need­ed to main­tain a flu­id and fresh expe­ri­ence. The abil­i­ty to switch between its intel­li­gent­ly-cho­sen col­or themes with a two-fin­gered ver­ti­cal swipe, alone will be jus­ti­fi­ca­tion enough for many users like myself to hand over anoth­er $4.99 to the Tap­bots devel­op­ers who’ve man­aged against all odds to one-up Twitter’s own mobile app devel­op­ment one last time. Over any oth­er alter­na­tive app, Tweet­bot 5 retains the robust qual­i­ties nec­es­sary to achieve #1 Paid Social App sta­tus on the App Store despite its new API shack­les.</p>
