      <description>&lt;![CDATA[Microsoft Build Olive Tracker&#xA;&#xA;New Microsoft Office features, the PowerToys Run Preview, and a test of Edge Chromium.&#xA;&#xA;I have no idea why I signed up to attend Microsoft&#39;s virtual 2020 Build Conference, but I did. I thought I&#39;d add my End User commentary to the mix. Sorry. My first event was called &#34;Every developer is welcome, with Scott Hanselman and guests.&#34; Hanselman is listed as a blogger and podcaster living (of course) in Portland. I&#39;m not a &#34;real&#34; developer, but I know what Microsoft Teams is, and I recognized the event as a desktop screenshare of his calls with different Microsoft employees. There was a child invasion and a dropped phone. I also noticed the icon for the &#34;new&#34; Microsoft Edge browser in his taskbar and realized that I hadn&#39;t downloaded it yet. I remedied that for the conference&#39;s sake - I thought it only appropriate that I try to use as much Microsoft software as possible in this context. I also installed the new PowerTools Run preview which I mentioned in my tips post.&#xA;&#xA;blockquote class=&#34;twitter-tweet tw-align-center&#34;p lang=&#34;en&#34; dir=&#34;ltr&#34;Epic a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/shanselman?refsrc=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;@shanselman/a moment! awesome, glad to share our new realities.

As reported by The Verge, Microsoft Fluid is going to change a lot:&#xA;&#xA;  Microsoft‚Äôs Fluid Framework sounds a lot like Google Docs, but it‚Äôs actually Google Docs on steroids. Microsoft is so confident it has built the future of productivity, it‚Äôs now open-sourcing its Fluid Framework so the rest of the world can help shape what it has created.&#xA;&#xA;There&#39;s also Microsoft Lists, which is reportedly going to revolutionize SharePoint Lists into something more modern and useful:&#xA;&#xA;  It builds off the existing feature in SharePoint, and will let you track progress and data to organize your teams, potentially making the company‚Äôs offerings more streamlined and productive.&#xA;&#xA;Microsoft PowerToys Run&#xA;&#xA;Microsoft Edge Chromium&#xA;&#xA;As an Office 365 administrator, I basically only use Edge for administrative/management tasks. Otherwise, I can&#39;t imagine a reason to use it over Firefox, Brave, Vivaldi, Chrome, Opera, etc, but I thought I&#39;d give the &#34;new&#34; (as of January) Edge a tryout for your sake and make it my default browser for a day as well as Microsoft&#39;s Bing search engine. There&#39;s also news specific to Build: Edge is integrating with Pinterest, of all things:&#xA;&#xA;  Now, Edge will feature a Pinterest-powered tool that will show suggestions from Pinterest at the bottom of a collection. Clicking on that, Microsoft says, will take users to a Pinterest board ‚Äúof similar, trending Pins so users can quickly find and add ideas relevant to their collection.‚Äù Users will also be able to export collections to Pinterest.&#xA;&#xA;I&#39;m in no position to &#34;test&#34; a browser, but the new Edge is noticeably faster at rendering pages and much much smoother when navigating between tabs/preference windows. It looks much more like Chrome, which makes sense. Perhaps because my install is absent of third-party extensions, opening new tabs and windows was much faster than my other browsers. I recorded a ~2 minute demo of normal browsing on my Surface Laptop 2.&#xA;&#xA;iframe src=&#34;https://player.vimeo.com/video/420430704&#34; width=&#34;auto&#34; height=&#34;auto&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allow=&#34;autoplay; fullscreen&#34; allowfullscreen/iframe&#xA;&#xA;In terms of touch support, Edge remains the only acceptable browser on Windows 10. If you&#39;ve spent money on a new PC recently, chances are your device is touch-enabled. If you&#39;re like me, you&#39;ve already disabled it. If not, you&#39;ll find scrolling and navigation in Edge have improved tremendously - it&#39;s like an entirely new browser because it is.&#xA;&#xA;  Because Edge used a different rendering engine than Chrome or Safari, it meant that it would sometimes have problems on websites. Testing a website against multiple browsers has always been difficult, and because Edge had so little uptake, it meant optimizing for it often fell off the priority list for web developers.&#xA;&#xA;I really like how easy it is to mute audio from tabs and how much better my CMS is rendered.
