Considering my use of Git as a means to track revisions on my own writing, it's important to note that you should feel free to replace all instances of "software" in the above statement with "words," "writing," "expression," etc.

While I appreciate tremendously the work and contribution of [Arlo Bendiken](https://ar.to/2010/01/set-your-code-free) in the form of The Unlicense, I would like to add that I see no need, personally, to make the refutation of Intellectual Property law regarding my own work into some profound ethical statement. As it stands, I have not to my knowledge been the victim of any sort of theft of any kind, and find the suggestion highly unlikely. If I *am*  made aware of such a case, there is certainly a possibility that I may change my mind on this issue, so I suppose I should highlight that **THESE TERMS ARE SUBJECT TO CHANGE**, though I suspect I would be more flattered and/or amused than actually offended. 

I would also like to annotate that my use of this license should not be regarded as a suggestion that anyone else follow my example, or that I "believe in" taking such action regarding one's work, generally. While I did indeed take the time to set up [a repository](https://github.com/extratone/eoi) of John Perry Barlow's "[The Economy of Ideas](https://www.wired.com/1994/03/economy-ideas/)" in a bunch of different document formats, I do not necessarily agree with all of what he argued, especially in the context of the world 27 years later. If you *are* particularly interested in my opinion on the matter for whatever reason, here is what I have to say to you:

The principled beginning of The Open Web was a great moment in history, but - like all historical principles - it is extremely important that we consider *context* and maintain an appropriate level of criticism when looking back on old manifestos written by old white guys. In general, try your best to *be reasonable*.

<h2 id="an-autobiographical-overview-of-my-personal-history-with-technology-and-its-contributions-to-my-current-perspective">An autobiographical overview of my personal history with technology and its contributions to my current perspective.</h2>

<p>Incalculable odds were against my arrival in this world happening in early 1994, positioning my life within a timeline that would allow me to bridge my two species’ most significant millenniums in the first grade as a student in the first class at Fairview Elementary school to receive curriculum-mandated exposure to brand-new Windows 98 PCs in its brand-new, fluorescent-lit computer lab in the center core of its 50-year-old rectangular brick structure. The lab also meant that ours was the first Fairview class to have the available relief of air conditioning during the school day. It’s unlikely that I would be home sick and watching the last television ever allowed in my mother’s living room as the second plane hit.</p>

<p>My peers and I would form a picogeneration without a name (perhaps we should be called the 9/11ers) — 91s and 92s wouldn’t have regular access to public school machines until they’d eclipsed the true prime of their development, and were just that much further along, mentally, to being able to comprehend the huge and terrifying concepts of 1) New York and 2) burning alive — while 98s like my niece were spared any such comprehension of death at all, yet now have to face the existentially future-sundering, darkly-mirrored reality of the Trump Presidency during the most critically uncertain period in the last stage of their brain’s transition to adulthood.</p>

<p>If there is truth in the cross-cultural supposition that souls have some sort of choice, pre-conception, over when they’re born, my own must have either cleaned out the house, or lost horrible, though I suspect I’ll never be able to confidently wager either way. This question of <em>how lucky or unlucky am I to be alive right now</em> is one which I find most fascinating — not just within myself, but within others my age. I declare us a generation largely because of my experiences under the assumption that my mid-Missouri upbringing represents the ultimate average in the American experiences of the time as the area has been a reliable sample of the clearest average of the country’s cultural, political, and economic life. Technically, it was quite unlikely that I arrive here as a new human being instead of China or India, and what if that, too was my choice?</p>

<p>Though less so, it was still against chance that I would be born to parents who would divorce very quickly after my birth, before my mind was able to form any tangible long-term memories, sparing me whatever pain could’ve resulted from their greater togetherness later nullified in front of me. I could’ve chosen them as well for the variety of experiences their situation would allow me as I grew up between my father’s 800-acre farm and my mother’s suburban house in Columbia, the college town an hour’s drive south. I write about my experiences now — so young — because I’ve likely already born witness to more extraordinary changes in human development than your parents, their parents, and their parents’ parents combined. At 24, my life has already spanned by far the most profound and expedited informational renaissance in human history — greater progress was made between the day I first rode a bicycle and the one on which I took my driver’s test than in thousands of years before it.</p>

<p>The sum of my father’s ordeals between 1950 and 1974 — from his birth until the age I am now — would indeed include watching a man set foot on a spatial body other than Earth for the first time, but would be mostly defined by work on the family’s soybean, corn, and wheat farms in central Illinois, driving carbureted tractors pulling cultivating equipment of the same basic design and function as had been pulled by horses, mules, and oxen for hundreds of years, and other implements — like the mechanical multi-row planter — that were new technology at the beginning of the century. For neighbors, he would walk behind the path of a square hay baler next to a moving flatbed trailer, upon which he would throw the 70–100 lb. rectangles of dead compacted grass by their twine through thick cowhide gloves. All of this I would get to experience in the next century on <em>his</em> farm, using the exact same equipment.</p>

<p>At home, he would watch NBC, ABC, and CBS on a CRT TV, as I would for several years until wireless television was legally transitioned to digital statewide in the summer of 2009. As an adolescent, he would form a business with friends cleaning out old abandoned barns in exchange for the rights of ownership to any finds inside, which led to his discovery of a hay-preserved 1929 Buick Sedan containing hand-written records of its every service. This car would change hands into his Uncle’s care as he went off to school in Champaign, married in Georgia, and eventually settled on the flat clay soil of the farm where I grew up, right on the border between Audrain and Monroe counties, Missouri. I was about 10 when we drove back to the family hub with a trailer in tow to collect the car from my Great Uncle, to my manic excitement.</p>

<p>Up until my mid-teens, my life was defined by my extreme reverence for historic cars, airplanes, tractors, and watercraft, and the time I spent operating, maintaining, restoring, or simply studying the assortment of these which I was allowed — often because of extraordinary circumstances — would form the component of my psychology which seeks to experience different cultures, ideas, and eras through the medium of engineering and design and relies on these to understand them. Like my father in his youth, I would learn to clean water out of a carburetor after the Oliver 88 had sat silent for too long, and I would piss in a chamber pot to avoid waking up my Grandfather by walking down creaking attic stairs and turning the lights on. I would learn how to shoot and drive before 10-years-old, and I would have the freedom to do both as I pleased on the miles of gravel roads that ran around home.</p>

<p>Though my stepfather bought me a PC of my own just as my first-grade computer class was ending, I could not conceive of a reason to occupy the dial-up line and block his incoming calls or faxes, so my use of the machine was limited to sparse writing and aggravating attempts to run Microsoft Flight Simulator 98 at approximately one frame per second on a 300MHz single-core Pentium II CPU. Though I was <em>extremely</em> fortunate compared to most middle-class kids my age at the time to have my own computer in my room, my relationship with it was not significant or particularly involved. I would leave it powered down for weeks at a time until my last two grades at Fairview, when homework assignments began to require it.</p>

<p>Perhaps the greatest gap between my mostly-suburbanite classmates and I was an exposure to Japanese entertainment and video games. I was once disallowed from a lunch table because I’d never heard of Pokémon or Luigi, but I <em>did</em> have a Sony Playstation at home on which I occasionally loaded <em>A Bug’s Life</em> to wander around its first level, perhaps in basal awe at the idea of manipulating what I saw on a screen in realtime. In self-imposed isolation from children my age, I wouldn’t develop any need to be socially competitive with video games as many of my peers would to carry with them into adulthood. I thought my interests in mechanical engineering to be above all of them, so I spent my time alone with heavy picturebooks on 20th century cars, tractors, and airplanes.</p>

<p>On the farm, my consistently agriculturally-proactive father was one of the first to have satellite internet for farm futures and weather reports on a pre-GUI machine which I don’t remember. As I was becoming computer literate in school, he would become extremely frustrated with the Windows XP-running machine he’d bought from a one-man, one-room computer shop in Centralia, and I would often solve some problem with bloatware or the goddamned printer. He would also subscribe to and install a first-generation DirectTV receiver, which had the first on-screen program guide I’d ever seen. In the evenings, I would watch hours of <em>Modern Marvels</em> on The History Channel, which presented the history, abstract functional theory, and implementation of a particular technology, both past and future. This single program — which has aired nearly 700 episodes since 1995 — is probably responsible for the majority of my at least rudimentary general knowledge in a variety of historic and “future” technological schools, and my curiosity about culture’s relationship with innovation.</p>

<p>Though my father’s interests differed significantly from mine — he thought more about growing and raising than of the tools one used to do it — he would indulge my many questions about how engines, hydraulics, and electrical systems worked, and indulged my curiosity by exposing me to the hidden communities of the most elderly, most obscure historic machinery enthusiasts like those of the Midwest Old Threshers Reunion in Mount Pleasant, Iowa — the Concours d’Elegance for antique tractor and reciprocating engine collectors. It was a similar event closer to home where I first operated a steam tractor — great, field-going locomotive-like vehicles that supplanted a need for horsepower in the late-1800s up until the Great Depression which chug, whistle, and puff along just like rail locomotives with a huge, gritty, iron steering wheel. As I recall, I was also given the opportunity to drive an unrestored Model T truck around the grounds that day — the knowledge from which I gained I cannot imagine being of much use ever again.</p>

<p>I was proud to the point of arrogance of my technical knowledge and experience in all the different things I had driven and operated, which my schoolmates were in no position to understand. I was elitist and anti-social about this as late as 8th grade, when I had just moved in to stay with my mother, who bought me a first generation iPhone which I proudly wore in a leather belt holster to Junior High. It would represent a shift in my fascination from very old technology toward the present and future.</p>

<p>I started talking online with a friend I’d first met years before at Fairview, who spent most of his time fiddling with his first-generation MacBook Pro. He originally exposed me to gadget bloggers on YouTube like Mark Watson and Jon Rettinger (both of whom are still full-time tech personalities.) My mom bought me a 13-inch aluminum-bodied MacBook (which would be sold as MacBook Pro after a single year,) and my lifestyle radically shifted inside my room, my computer, and my Xbox 360. My friend and I would both obsess together over software, design, and gadget – experimenting with our own tech YouTube channels until high school, where I would be adopted by a new friend group who would finally socialize me.</p>

<p>Recently, I have written about the contrasts and discrepancies of consumer technology development as its progress has disconnected from the upward linear trajectory in use, quality, and genuine innovation for the End User in a departure which has been especially visible from my perspective as an academically-untrained, but intensely demanding user in the past five years. When hardware was still the industry focus before ~2012, there was a tremendous amount of optimism among journalists and enthusiasts because each successive generation of devices had added more tangible capabilities. Publications like <em>Gizmodo</em> and <em>Engadget</em> made a fortune publishing reviews and comparison tests of hardware offerings across every segment of tech, and the discourse they generated had a noticeable influence on design. I remember this time well because it accented my last few years before adulthood, when I had plenty of spare time, energy, and curiosity to keep up.</p>

<p>The general consumer technology narrative since Steve Jobs’ death has become increasingly more about the companies who design and sell hardware and software than about how and why their consumers actually use them, and the result has been a series of new product segments with little defensible place in my own linear timeline of innovation, especially where productivity is involved. Augmented and Virtual Reality are quite explicitly escapist industries, yet to fill any significant need which was before unfilled. The same could be argued about voice assistants and smartwatches — neither of which <em>remove</em> obstacles in most users’ day-to-day lives but instead <em>contribute</em> to the array of tasks and devices which already seek their attention.</p>

<p>Of course, there are defensibly sound business incentives behind the industry’s new, fragmented direction, but I would also argue that there are those, too, for genuinely revisiting both <em>what we should be doing</em> and what we should be seeking to <em>learn to do</em> with technology. In a more abstract sense, I have written about whether or not we should want to be living in this particular now, and how the way we feel about the future should inform what we do in the present.</p>

<p>I cannot help but observe human progress from a perspective of powerlessness, acute alienation, and amused awe, which has already lent to a significant quantity of occasionally original thoughts as I watch, having witnessed an odd diversity of American life and culture. I’ve published them to entertain and to demonstrate a few methods of reflection on what it is <em>you</em> really want from the times you are living.</p>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="book e-content"><p><img src="https://i.snap.as/TdR9BlV.jpeg" alt="Xerox Alto"/></p>

<p>In all likelihood, you have heard of Electronic Mail, but I’ve noticed that much of our audience (and 18-25 year olds in general) have been consistently estranged from it, despite its <a href="http://www.journalism.org/2017/02/09/part-ii-characteristics-of-news-instances/">prevalence</a> in news media. Perhaps it’s not immediately evident as <em>the coolest thing</em>, but if “staying informed” and grass roots-ing brands are still as hip as they appear to be, email newsletters <em>should</em> soon become so groovy that you’ll begin leaving the house for a down-the-street coffee shop <em>just to be seen reading them.</em></p>

<h2 id="welcome-to-the-wonderful-world-of-aggregation">Welcome to the wonderful world of <em>aggregation</em>.</h2>

<p>In many ways, email newsletters are the antithesis of (and medication for) Facebook’s school of ruminate aggregation. You know – the doctrine that will forever be remembered as the original intellectual catalyst for the downfall of human civilization. The skimming and the jumping… how many Facebook users could I fool by simply sending featured images, headlines, and abstracts for social cards without any hyperlinked destination? Could I manage to get Donald Tump elected President of the United States by way of Scrolling Hypnosis, alone?</p>

<p>Staying <em>informed</em> is a habit of time-honored traditions. Gramps has stopped by Bill’s General Goods every weekday morning for twenty years with a handful of change because <em>The Sleepyville Monitor</em> is a part of his identity – dependent upon- and accountable to his trust. We’ve continued into 21st century news media as if a digital equivalent of his readership would be <em>so</em> difficult to fathom that legacy publications are best-off forcing the standards of print onto the web instead of investing in research/experimentation, which is why the fucking <em>New York Times</em> still sends your handset away to a separate <em>mobile version</em> of their site – a horrible remnant of browsing from the oughts that’s rarely seen on <em>blogs</em>, these days, much less on properties of titanic news powerhouses.</p>

<p>For whatever reason, most of the industry has behaved as if Grandpa’s sort of routines no longer exist in day-to-day life, but – if anything – our Automated Hell is <em>vastly</em> more saturated with them, no? Unless you’re sequestered away in a diligently self-made <em>Email-Free Zone</em>, you’re receiving shit daily. I, myself, am considerably proud of my ~60,000 unread emails, and I’ve conceded to the vast majority of the popup opt-ins I’ve encountered since shortly after our launch because I rarely found myself visiting/reading undesirable web.</p>

<p>“I don’t email” is a sentiment I hear from young people often, which is perfectly fine. I don’t vote!</p>

<p>If it’s true that “nobody wants that,” nobody should be participating in the democratic process. Yes, I’ve experienced the <em>no patience for more than 300 words</em> phase of life, and I understand wholeheartedly the desire to retreat forever from it all. I would much rather exist in an old, open farmhouse with a wife, a garden, no internet, dusty old literature, and two ancient Bentleys than spend all my time crafting mirages in a black mirror, but neither cowardice nor negligence are options for us, right now. This country doesn’t have room for any more.</p>

<p>That’s not to say that you should be <em>expected</em> to read 6 hours of news a day – it’s the media’s (our) job to maintain our own accessibility, and for this, daily/weekly newsletters are an unbelievably effective method. The meta-aggregators in today’s industry are often paid <em>exclusively</em> to ease your digestion, both independently and by mastheads.</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/davepell">Dave Pell</a> is a superb gateway from the former – an aggregation legend. His daily correspondence – called <a href="http://nextdraft.com"><em>NextDraft</em></a> <em>-</em> is more often than not the ideal front page of the day.</p>

<p><img src="https://i.snap.as/FBb5naU.png" alt="POLITICO Playbook"/></p>

<p>I’m asking those of you youths yet without your own reading habits to trust my taste – if not my authority – and explore some options from my own inbox.</p>

<p>Ultimately, you just can’t replace a legacy die-hard-news shop for a good political briefing. The <a href="http://www.politico.com/playbook"><em>POLITICO Playbook</em></a> is the most time-efficient way to keep up with U.S. and World politics as you walk about your life, and many of <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/newsletters?mbid=nl"><em>The New Yorker</em></a><a href="https://www.newyorker.com/newsletters?mbid=nl">’s newsletters</a> are a great longform, much more visual compliment. For a <em>slightly</em> less-chaotic, but still relatively unproven alternative to the former, try <a href="https://www.axios.com/axios-am/"><em>Axios AM</em></a>.</p>

<p><em>National Geographic</em> may seem a bit <em>old guard</em>, but has remained a consistently excellent photographic publication. Its print edition has no place but on the poll in tangible media subscription terms, but it <em>has</em> been quite depressing, as of late. Turns out, we’ve made quite a dystopia for ourselves, and their ability to encapsulate the world can be overstimulating, at times. If you’d like a bit more control – or are uncompromisingly digital-only – its web edition has matured quite competently, and is elegantly parsed by <a href="https://members.nationalgeographic.com/">their newsletters</a>. (You’ll need to create an account, if you don’t already have one.)</p>

<p><img src="https://i.snap.as/JP71lXK.png" alt="Medium Digest"/></p>

<p>It’s no secret that Medium has been on the decline, lately – and it’s always required a particular sort of tolerance – but <em>The Daily Digest</em> still delivers a few important essays, occasionally. And of course – there are options by regularity and topic, which you can fiddle with <a href="https://medium.com/me/settings">here</a> when logged in.</p>

<p>On the more innovative end of the industry, there’s <a href="https://theoutline.com/post/1125/subscribe-to-the-outline-newsletter"><em>The Outline</em></a><a href="https://theoutline.com/post/1125/subscribe-to-the-outline-newsletter">’s newsletter</a>, which – being the property of a more deliberate, gorgeous, open-web publication – is a bit underwhelming, but then again… why aren’t you just looking at the site, anyway? <a href="https://pudding.cool/"><em>The Pudding</em></a>’s output may be sparse, but – again – just… <em>look at it.</em> I can’t claim to have made much use of the information presented in their gorgeous visual essays, but it sure is fascinating.</p>

<p><em>The Verge</em>’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/newsletter">Command Line</a> is often so clever, <em>it can almost make tech news engaging</em>. (Our very own <a href="http://bit.ly/thetone"><em>The Tone</em></a> is directly modeled after it, visually.) <em>WIRED</em>’s <a href="https://www.wired.com/newsletter">newsletter</a> isn’t bad either – it’d be excellent if its parent website wasn’t so <em>fucking broken.</em></p>

<p>Then there’s <a href="https://warisboring.com/"><em>War Is Boring</em></a> <em>-</em> a tactical/tech news site? I recently discovered. “From drones to AKs, high technology to low politics.” I wouldn’t describe it as a primary read for me, but it’s still nice to see what the Big Boys are up to, once in a while. (I am mostly just waiting attentively for the <em>U.S.S. Iowa</em> to be put up for auction.)</p>

<p>If you’re a filthy word nerd like myself, it’s likely you’ve seen a Tweet or two from the <a href="https://twitter.com/HaggardHawks">Haggard Hawks</a> account – <a href="http://www.paulanthonyjones.com/">Paul Anthony Jones</a>’ highly-educated musings on “obscure words, language &amp; etymology facts.” After an excellent few years of playful indulgences, the project now has a whole DweebNet with a <a href="http://www.haggardhawks.com/newsletter">newsletter</a> that always fascinates, if a bit dryly. What did you expect?</p>

<p><em>The Poetry Foundation</em> can also be <a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/newsletter">easily convinced</a> to send you their Poem of the Day, and biweekly newsletter.</p>

<p>And finally… <strong>the meta media folks</strong>.</p>

<p><em>Columbia Journalism Review</em>’s always the prettiest to look at when it comes to coverage of industry, and their squeaky-clean perspective won me over quite quickly. They send their ultra-clean, editor-compiled <a href="http://archives.cjr.org/resources/"><em>Weekly Highlights</em></a> every Thursday. <a href="http://bit.ly/apneedtoknow"><em>The American Press Institute</em></a><a href="http://bit.ly/apneedtoknow">’s list</a> isn’t a bad idea, either. Then, of course, there’s Harvard’s <em>NiemanLab</em>, which offers <a href="http://www.niemanlab.org/subscribe/">afternoon and Saturday morning emails</a>. All three often cite the <em>Pew Research Center</em>, which offers i<a href="http://www.pewresearch.org/follow-us/">ts own palette of email lists</a>, should you find yourself <em>hungry for d a t a</em>. Though, I do not, and I enjoy them.</p>

<p>Landing on the “homepage” of even the most familiar online publications can feel daunting and impersonal, but having an authority on the industry (hopefully, with some sense of humor) parse the torrent and deliver it unto <em>your personal inbox</em> can ease the reading process into a <em>much</em> more intimate, sensical, enjoyable, and productive expenditure of your valuable time.</p>

<p>For a publication of our scale, the routine of a newsletter can act first as a simple reminder of our existence, and mature into a way to reach out directly to our audience in a distinctly <em>magazine</em> methodology – one which pervades a real, consequential relationship with consumers.</p>

<p>And it’s d i g i t a l !!!!</p>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="book e-content"><p><em>The following was sent as part of <a href="https://tinyletter.com/DavidBlue">a personal TinyLetter</a> I&#39;ve just begun in the hopes of rejuvenating my ability to tell stories.</em></p>

<p>There are a few entities which continue to validate what I&#39;m pursuing, but <a href="https://twitter.com/joshuatopolsky">Joshua Topolsky</a> and his <a href="https://theoutline.com/"><em>The Outline</em></a> are particularly worth noting. In search of reassurance, I listened to a <a href="https://digiday.com/podcast/outlines-josh-topolsky-theres-much-sameness-digital-media/">podcast</a> he appeared on in February, last night, and also found <a href="https://longform.org/posts/longform-podcast-27-joshua-topolsky">one</a> from 2013, when he was still EiC of <em>The Verge</em>. Basically the entirety of the first is within the idealism I&#39;ve risked most of myself for, in case you&#39;re curious. I&#39;ve looked up to Topolsky in a huge way, this past year. He has done – and is doing – many things which I am intrinsically drawn to earn for my legacy, and the presence of his wife on his staff (their few <a href="https://soundcloud.com/tomorrowpodcast/episode-28-laura-june-and-the-contrarian-disposition">podcasts</a> together are adorable in a very particular way,) is idyllic in appearance, at least. I love the way they talk about each other. I suppose spousal editorial staff is probably the personal hell of a good many people. Perhaps, it&#39;s even my own. Listening to him talk on Digiday, though, reminded me – along with a few other works I&#39;ve consumed lately – that <em>technically</em>, <em>Extratone</em> is a <em>business.</em> Or at least... That it must become one eventually or die forever. While trying to explain my future plans to a friend, I inadvertently layed out some &#39;steps for growth.&#39;</p>
<ol><li><strong>Form and activate the community.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Build a beautiful, one-of-a-kind method of content delivery.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Attain a fairly dependable content cadence.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Sell the product in a way that immediately and – from then on – consistently ensures and/or furthers its quality.</strong></li></ol>

<p>I guess we&#39;re somewhere between 2 and 3 right now. I&#39;m still building a body of written work more or less on my own, which is okay, considering that nobody is paid. I suppose it&#39;d be most desirable – before I move to the Northwest – to figure out how to make <em>The Tone</em> as much of a learning experience for my closest staff as possible. And regardless of all other external goals of the magazine, I think it is more than safe to say that I&#39;ve learned more in the past 10 months from a fucking WordPress website than I would&#39;ve if I&#39;d spent that time at the Journalism school. The first annual renewal payment for extratone dot com just went through, actually. A year ago, I was <em>much</em> more entertaining, but virtually directionless. I honestly can&#39;t tell if I feel any better internally, day-to-day, but I know I am at least attaining the capability of real friendship for the first time in my life, and I suppose that&#39;s more than worth losing virtually all of my engagement on Twitter.</p>

<p>Perhaps its even worth losing a portion of the freshness in my perspective – the stuff I thought made it worth it in the first place. Especially if my staff maintains it healthily within their own.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll admit that – in retrospect, after spending a year reading, writing, and digitally fussing – a lot of my original content smells like edgy nonsense. Some of the work within our network does too, honestly, but it&#39;s usually much less so.</p>

<p>Of course, that transition required an excruciating crucible, for me, but that&#39;s exactly why I&#39;m incessantly compelled to make as much use of my trauma as possible: so that my friends and staff may be able make progress toward more fulfilling lives without such a massive up-front cost.</p>

<p>As I was writing my <a href="https://bit.ly/hellbird">interview with mastodon&#39;s creator</a>, I kept an eye out for related coverage, and eventually saw what <em>[PCMag</em>](<a href="http://www.pcmag.com/article/352875/what-is-mastodon-and-will-it-kill-twitter">http://www.pcmag.com/article/352875/what-is-mastodon-and-will-it-kill-twitter</a>) did, and it&#39;s unwanted rant-spuringly aggravating language.</p>

<p>For most of my adult life, I&#39;ve been trying to figure out why publications like <em>PCMag</em> feel it necessary to belittle their audience <em>and</em> their subjects to such a degree. Silicon Alley can&#39;t possibly be <em>that</em> vapid as to nix all soul in any story, ever.</p>

<p><img src="http://gallery.tinyletterapp.com/e8ecb4f78686444d5a5c89d53c49de7c8feb8ac5/images/f15ad2c3-dbd3-4697-9c37-b4d97f260dd8.png" alt="uh"/>
<em>I mean… What in the hell is this, even?</em></p>

<p>I haven&#39;t been a reader since I used to loiter in Barnes &amp; Noble with a pile of print editions in the oughts, but this sort of layout has got to be some kind of <strong>digital sin.</strong></p>

<p>I&#39;m not going to bother digging through the publication to compare this work with others for the moment. Perhaps one day, I&#39;ll feel the need to polish this rant into an argument and make it more visible. Surely, though, the proximity of this abomination to the word <em>Mag</em> or even <em>Magazine</em> must keep <em>somebody</em> awake at night.</p>

<p>That&#39;s not to say it doesn&#39;t take some sort of discipline. I doubt I could write in this way without hulking hyper-deliberately over <em>wherever the fuck this dialect comes from.</em> I think it&#39;s almost certainly more efficient as an informative device than my piece, or <a href="https://motherboard.vice.com/en*us/article/mastodon-is-like-twitter-without-nazis-so-why-are-we-not-using-it">Sarah Jeong&#39;s</a>, but the assumption that readers would be so disinterested as to hesitate to even commit to <em>complete sentences</em> regarding something <em>actually</em> newsworthy for a technology publication should be taken personally.</p>

<p><em>(This is going to echo what Topolsky said in both of those podcasts in big ways, but I&#39;ll try to keep it relatively brief.)</em></p>

<p><strong>I believe there is an audience that is craving attention to detail in their stories, a more intimate, longer-lasting, and more invested relationship with a much smaller number of publications.</strong></p>

<p>Even a sense of involvement in the process. It&#39;s probably a direct result of my longtime consumption of car magazines – most of which still have sizable sections dedicated to direct, public correspondence with readers. It&#39;s also cross-platform to a surreal degree. Auto journalists of all tiers will straight up engage with you on Twitter. (<em>MotorTrend</em> literally prints YouTube comments.)</p>

<p>Sure, the readership is old, and the topic is an outlier (it&#39;s fairly common knowledge that &#39;car people&#39; are waaaay more vulnerable to obsession than other special interest communities,) but the species is more or less the same, and the results are plain as day, any time you care to look. In recently returning my attention to technology journalism, I&#39;ve noticed an irritating affront to meta conversation with strangers. My theory is that they&#39;ve been paid for their words so long that they develop a very particular greed towards them, which is why academic journalism institutes are immediately shunned by their alumni after graduation until they are definitely Too Tired to sling copy and begin to climb sortof diagonally through editorial titles until they are stashed away in some hole. Then, after ruminating until their first encounter with Actual Death – if they&#39;re still interested in the whole thing – they crawl out to be propped up in front of moderately sized bodies of petrified students to scream in 100% bitterness about <em>The Ethics</em> that plagued them spiritually and financially their entire career at the acolytes as their last joke on the world.</p>

<p>But they won&#39;t engage with strangers on Twitter.</p>

<p>As someone who – for better or worse – chose to sidestep the academic route, I will never advocate for any value in withholding information – especially funny stories – about <em>Extratone</em>&#39;s operation. If anything, <em>rediscovering relevance</em> is a wholly meta pillar of our editorial bent. (Hence, why Tim calls us <em>The Nieman Lab of Community College.</em>)</p>

<p>I also believe the subscriber &amp; advertising revenue models are <em>directly</em> - if not <em>primarily</em> - involved in the constriction of conversations regarding a publication&#39;s operation. It&#39;s my goal to cultivate a group of subscribers that are directly invested in the product (there&#39;s another new word on my part) financially, intellectually, and emotionally. It&#39;s not exactly unheard of, ya know.</p>

<p><em>Anywho</em>, I&#39;m going to leave you in peace for now. I&#39;ve really enjoyed this wanton spewing of conjecture, but then... who doesn&#39;t love to go on, unchecked?</p>

<p>Is <em>this</em> what blogging is? It&#39;s fucking obnoxious.</p>

<p>Thank you for reading and <em>beware the fucking egg</em>.</p>
