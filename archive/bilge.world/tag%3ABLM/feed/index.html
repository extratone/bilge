      <title>Discord is Better Than Slack</title>

      <description>&lt;![CDATA[Discord Art Orange&#xA;&#xA;Why Extratone has used Discord instead of Slack for our team chat.&#xA;&#xA;Back in 2015, I hosted a pre-Extratone culture podcast called Drycast with musician friends from all over the net. To record remotely, we originally used Teamspeak 3 - a gamer VoIP staple. When I discovered Discord, I thought we&#39;d found podcasting heaven. Originally, the free plan included 128kbps audio in its voice channels, which was nearly twice what we were getting out of our paid Teamspeak server. If I were still podcasting, Discord&#39;s just-released server video feature would undoubtedly prove invaluable for live streams.&#xA;&#xA;blockquote class=&#34;twitter-tweet tw-align-center&#34;p lang=&#34;en&#34; dir=&#34;ltr&#34;are you thankful for Discord?/p&amp;mdash; David Blue (@NeoYokel) a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/1261334179352100865?refsrc=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;May 15, 2020/a/blockquote script async src=&#34;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&#34; charset=&#34;utf-8&#34;/script&#xA;&#xA;According to a poll I ran on Twitter, 2/3rds of all people on Earth are thankful for Discord&#39;s existence. This is not surprising considering what every Discord user is still offered without spending any money at all: community spaces with audio/video and text chat capability, organizable by Twitch and YouTube-integrated roles with a plethora of different permission options, instantly and easily shareable by customizable temporary or permanent invite links through an application that&#39;s about as cross-platform as one can get (Windows, Mac, Linux, Android, iOS, or simply one&#39;s web browser.) Those of us that remember IRC, Ventrilo, and Teamspeak should all consider Discord a tremendous gift.&#xA;&#xA;iframe width=&#34;auto&#34; height=&#34;auto&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/NNJ2n6XKmmA?controls=0&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allow=&#34;accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&#34; allowfullscreen/iframe&#xA;&#xA;Never before have so many VoIP, video, and text chat features been offered together, or in such a beautiful package. &#34;What we really did was create an all-in-one voice, video, and text chat app that replaced this constellation of tools that people would use,&#34; said CEO Jason Citron in an interview with CNBC. Technically in terms of these details, Discord has no competition. Slack offers text and voice chat with its paid plans, yes, but nothing close in terms of video - especially considering Discord Go Live, its fairly-new streaming feature, which allows users to stream game video directly to 10 other users in the server.
