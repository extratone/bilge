Considering my use of Git as a means to track revisions on my own writing, it's important to note that you should feel free to replace all instances of "software" in the above statement with "words," "writing," "expression," etc.

While I appreciate tremendously the work and contribution of [Arlo Bendiken](https://ar.to/2010/01/set-your-code-free) in the form of The Unlicense, I would like to add that I see no need, personally, to make the refutation of Intellectual Property law regarding my own work into some profound ethical statement. As it stands, I have not to my knowledge been the victim of any sort of theft of any kind, and find the suggestion highly unlikely. If I *am*  made aware of such a case, there is certainly a possibility that I may change my mind on this issue, so I suppose I should highlight that **THESE TERMS ARE SUBJECT TO CHANGE**, though I suspect I would be more flattered and/or amused than actually offended. 

I would also like to annotate that my use of this license should not be regarded as a suggestion that anyone else follow my example, or that I "believe in" taking such action regarding one's work, generally. While I did indeed take the time to set up [a repository](https://github.com/extratone/eoi) of John Perry Barlow's "[The Economy of Ideas](https://www.wired.com/1994/03/economy-ideas/)" in a bunch of different document formats, I do not necessarily agree with all of what he argued, especially in the context of the world 27 years later. If you *are* particularly interested in my opinion on the matter for whatever reason, here is what I have to say to you:

The principled beginning of The Open Web was a great moment in history, but - like all historical principles - it is extremely important that we consider *context* and maintain an appropriate level of criticism when looking back on old manifestos written by old white guys. In general, try your best to *be reasonable*.

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="book e-content"><p><img src="https://i.snap.as/2ixUKqT.png" alt="Zalgo Generator for iOS"/></p>

<h2 id="a-powerful-ios-utility-for-fucking-digital-text-with-ruthless-efficiency">A powerful iOS utility for fucking digital text with ruthless efficiency.</h2>

<p>A warning siren sounds louder still for the current state of the <em>Digital Divide</em> than the profoundly ignorant spectacle of Mark Zuckerberg’s drooling, ghoulish interrogators last year from the digital hole of none other than <a href="https://validator.w3.org">W3School’s trusty web validator</a>, which would surely be rated as the Most Anxious Being in History if it were to acquire sentience. The CSS file this very webpage referenced returned no fewer than <em><a href="https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator?lang=en&profile=css3svg&uri=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.extratone.com&usermedium=all&vextwarning=&warning=1">350 syntax errors</a></em> at the time of this writing; <strong><a href="https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator?lang=en&profile=css3svg&uri=http%3A%2F%2Ffacebook.com&usermedium=all&vextwarning=&warning=1">Facebook dot com’s login page</a></strong> set off only 55. For going on a <em>decade</em>, now, the web has continued to expand into a grotesque, diseased mass.</p>

<p>Yet another piece of software I have notably been using for 10 years: the infamous <a href="http://www.eeemo.net/">eemo.net</a> Zalgo web text fucker. Ideally, I’d now proceed to embed some special examples of the hedonistic online text vandalism which the tool enabled me to inflict widely throughout my adolescence. However – as you can probably imagine – <em>searching</em> for these criminally-broken posts using standard tools provided by the services that have hosted them is virtually futile. In retrospect, I do not recall ever eliciting any acknowledgment of Zalgo’s effects, yet I’m positive that at least the <em>majority</em> of my victims set eyes upon the mess at some point – their silence is actually more entertaining than not, I think. Despite my extensive use of the format, I made a point to maintain my total ignorance about the origin of “<a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/zalgo">Zalgo</a>” for the past decade – only spoiling it <strong>in the name of good journalism</strong> for your sake and this review.</p>

<blockquote><p>On forums and image boards, scrambled text began being associated with Zalgo with phrases like “he comes” and “he waits behind the wall.” David Higgins revealed that the text is an ~abuse~ of a Unicode feature that enables the user to combine multiple superscript and subscript characters into a vertical line.</p></blockquote>

<p>By bizarre coincidence or some ridiculously obscure, intractable common cultural thread (which would probably take a lifetime to successfully trace,) <a href="https://octodon.social/@DaveHiggins">Dave Higgins</a> and I were <em>already mutuals</em> on Mastodon before I had any idea his name was at all associated with Zalgo. More bizarre still: Dave must’ve been watching his timeline at the exact moment when I <a href="https://mastodon.social/@DavidBlue/102564857843257870">posted the above quote</a> mentioning him.</p>

<iframe src="https://octodon.social/@DaveHiggins/102565065494333224/embed" class="mastodon-embed" style="max-width: 100%; border: 0" width="300" height="250" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>

<p>Unfortunately, it seems his blog has moved, killing the hyperlink citation in one of the two relevant search engine results for “zalgo”: <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/zalgo">its <em>Know Your Meme</em> page</a>. <a href="https://davidjhiggins.wordpress.com/?s=zalgo">Searching the same term</a> on his new WordPress blog yields <em>absolutely nothing</em>, so perhaps “I deny everything” was a more sincere response than one expected. A thread on <em>Stack Overflow</em> entitled <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6579844/how-does-zalgo-text-work">“How does Zalgo text work?”</a> explains the fuckery in more detail than I ever could:</p>

<blockquote><p>You can easily construct a character sequence, consisting of a base character and “combining above” marks, of any length, to reach any desired visual height, assuming that the rendering software conforms to the Unicode rendering model.</p></blockquote>

<p>There is something artistic about destroyed text like this – something that&#39;s more than just edgy chaos. I believe in “<a href="https://mashable.com/article/surreal-memes/">surreal memes</a>” that can break Facebook and Twitter posts. I believe in Zalgo, and I believe you need <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/zalgo-generator/id1178473555">Zalgo Generator for iOS</a> on your phone <em>right now</em>.</p>

<p>I don’t want you to think this is just another listicle to mark as spam or ignore completely – though it technically is, I suppose. I know how it looks… because I’ve run into many of them and have been just as irritated as you. In fact, I would be so bold as to presume I’ve run into <em>many many</em> more than you have simply because a primary hobby of mine has always been Just Trying to Do Things On The Computer without any academic authority or hands-on training. This is a way of life for my generation and those proceeding it, yes, but I promise you that I have gone far, far deeper than the vast majority of anyone you know. What I’m ultimately trying to do here is to spare you the hundreds – perhaps <em>thousands</em> – of hours I have had to spend mulling through shitty workflows throughout my childhood and adulthood before I stumbled upon Good Practices (i.e. Better Ways to Do Things.)</p>

<p>I want you to come away from this list feeling as liberated and powerful as I do now when I’m On My Computer without any condescension or tedium. Unfortunately, there’s probably going to be some of both, so please stick with me and don’t take it personally. I do <em>a lot</em> of online reading, writing, and fiddling. I’ve been compelled to do these things in one form or another since very early childhood, and what follows could be described as a list of my favorite tools to accomplish things. Almost all of them are entirely free to use and the vast majority of them are easily and beautifully functional as well. They are what I suggest for my own mother to use, for what that’s worth, and I would argue sincerely for their extreme importance. <em>Don’t waste your life on bad software.</em></p>

<h2 id="you-need-a-password-manager">You Need a Password Manager</h2>

<p>In 2020, password managers are no longer optional for digital life. <strong>They are mandatory</strong>. If you only ever heed a single piece of my advice, ever, <em>please</em> make it this one. <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/picks/the-best-password-managers">Most password managers available</a> are secure, cross-platform, optionally cloud-synced tools that help you generate, store, and organize digital credentials. More likely than not, you’re already using one in your favorite browser. On MacOS and iOS, Safari is linked to a service called Keychain, which is – functionally – a robust password manager. On signup for a given website or service, Safari should prompt you to automatically generate secure, complex passwords to store in Keychain. Generally, it’s pretty smart about knowing when it’s time to retrieve the credentials with Touch-ID, but for when it <em>isn’t</em>, you should know <a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/keychain-access/what-is-keychain-access-kyca1083/mac">how to manually retrieve passwords from Keychain</a>. If you’re deeply enough embedded into the Mac ecosystem, you can feel free to continue to rely on this process as long as you know how to help yourself when it fails. I’m not going to tell you who to trust, but I do <em>almost</em> actually believe in Apple’s commitment to securing user data, if only because of the way their incentives are aligned (in contrast with those in front of data-funded organizations like Google.)</p>

<p>If you’re using a Windows Home Machine and/or an Android smartphone, I believe it’s more urgent that you find a standalone password management solution immediately. I use a gorgeous app called <a href="https://www.enpass.io/">Enpass</a> to store all of my passwords as well as my bank credentials, credit cards, driver’s license information, and anything else I might need to keep handy, securely. I can use virtually any cloud or file-sharing service to keep my “vaults” synced between all of my devices: Microsoft OneDrive, Google Drive, Dropbox, iCloud, Box, etc, and I also regularly create encrypted local backups just in case. I can even <em>share</em> end-to-end encrypted credentials with another device or Enpass installation. I migrated to Enpass two years ago after using <a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/password-managers/best-password-managers-review-digital-security-privacy-ease-of-use/">1Password</a> for nearly 10. It was intuitive and virtually seamless, as such things in software tend to be these days, and as a result, I haven’t had to memorize a single password since my adolescence. Enpass allows me to create custom login templates for quick differentiation when creating new entries as well as picturized categories and tags. With one click, even the icon can be pulled from a given URL’s favicon to help keep my vault looking visually itemized. It also includes presets for a hundred services or so – from Google to Wix to Yahoo! Japan.</p>

<h2 id="total-recall-with-a-clipboard-manager">Total Recall with a Clipboard Manager</h2>

<p>Imagine if everything you had ever copied (as in <strong>Ctrl-C</strong>) were listed in linear order, <a href="https://vimeo.com/407790756">easily and instantly searchable</a> via a single global keyboard shortcut (<strong>Alt-`</strong>) and navigable with the arrow keys. Imagine if you could then export an archive of your clipboard so <em>nothing</em> could ever be lost. Imagine clipboard <em>tabs</em> that are easily switchable. <a href="https://hluk.github.io/CopyQ/">CopyQ</a> – an “advanced clipboard manager” – is one of my favorite software discoveries of all time. Some workdays, I use it literally hundreds of instances in my workflow. It is difficult to describe how much more useful it makes the clipboard feature – something we’ve all been using for decades, now. For someone like me who <a href="https://extratone.com/three-years-of-good-reads">copies a ridiculous amount of links every day</a>, CopyQ’s functionality has truly become <em>life-changing</em>.</p>

<p><img src="https://i.snap.as/G4JSrQb.png" alt="Windows 10 Keyboard Shortcuts - General"/></p>

<h2 id="alt-d-and-other-keyboard-shortcuts">Alt-D and Other Keyboard Shortcuts</h2>

<p>Somehow, I did not discover <strong>Alt-D</strong> until 2018, which means that I had spent the entirety of my 24 years since <em>triple-clicking</em> to select every single URL I’d ever copied. I built a media company this way, and I can’t believe nobody told me about this shortcut. Open any given web browser, use <strong>Alt-D</strong>, and your selection will move to the URL in the address bar on top of the page. It’s very possible this will be of little use to you, but anyone who regularly shares or copies links will save themselves <em>so</em> much time. I felt the same way when I discovered text navigation with <strong>Alt</strong>, <strong>Shift</strong>, <strong>Ctrl</strong> + the arrow keys. Most of these are cross-platform, but I am specifically focusing on <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12445/windows-keyboard-shortcuts">Windows shortcuts</a> for this piece because that’s what I’m currently using.</p>

<h3 id="arrow-key-related-shortcuts">Arrow key-related shortcuts</h3>

<p>·    <strong>Shift</strong> in conjunction with the arrow keys selects text in a document surrounding the cursor.</p>

<p>·    <strong>Alt</strong> in conjunction with the arrow keys allows one to go forward or backward in a browser.</p>

<p>·    <strong>Ctrl</strong> in conjunction with the arrow keys allows one to navigate text by word.</p>

<p>Virtually all of the “Windows logo key” shortcuts are usable in day-to-day workflows. I use <strong>Win-D</strong> to immediately minimize all windows and show the desktop on the regular. Microsoft is <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/17/21224904/microsoft-windows-10-launcher-powertoy-spotlight-alfred-details">currently testing</a> a feature like MacOS’ spotlight which is triggered with this key.</p>

<blockquote><p>Designed to replace the existing Win + R shortcut, the new launcher will include options to quickly search apps and files across Windows and support for plugins like calculators, dictionaries, and search engines.</p></blockquote>

<p>We can only hope this feature will be as useful as spotlight (which is triggered with <strong>⌘-Spacebar</strong> for you Mac users,) and will be implemented as standard as soon as possible. If you’re not already using basic shortcuts for functions like closing tabs/windows and cut/copy/pasting text, I’d advise you to begin as soon as possible. It can be hard to commit, but I promise it’ll make your life better. Try printing out a list of shortcuts for your particular operating system to keep by your workspace and/or find or create an image of the list to set as your <a href="http://extratone.wiki/net/index.php/s/2Pn5H32yYYrm3bG">desktop background</a> for a while.</p>

<h2 id="learn-markdown-immediately">Learn Markdown Immediately</h2>

<p>While we’re on the subject of text – and hopefully without finding ourselves exploring <a href="https://medium.com/redletters/evernote-dropbox-paper-and-the-history-of-word-processing-9407b2c7afba">the entire history of word processing</a> – I’d like to evangelize what very well might be the Ultimate Formatting Language for digital text. It’s called <a href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax">Markdown</a>, and it’s something you’ve likely already used in one form or another. Technically, Markdown is “<a href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">a text-to-HTML conversion tool for web writers</a>,” but – more importantly – it’s a method of stylizing text which is as simple as possible, easy to universalize, and already quite popular. While <em>Vice</em> argues that Markdown is a “<a href="https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/pa7nbn/slacks-new-rich-text-editor-shows-why-markdown-still-scares-people">power-user tool</a>,” I’d suggest that it’s one everybody should make use of. Though I am currently writing this in Word (for the first time in a good while,) I’m going to <a href="https://slate.com/technology/2012/04/microsoft-word-is-cumbersome-inefficient-and-obsolete-its-time-for-it-to-die.html">pay for it later</a>.</p>

<blockquote><p>A Word file is the story-fax of the early 21st century: cumbersome, inefficient, and a relic of obsolete assumptions about technology.</p></blockquote>

<p>“[<a href="https://lifehacker.com/what-is-markdown-and-why-is-it-better-for-my-to-do-lis-5943320">Markdown] has all the advantages of plain text, but with the organizational power of a word processor</a>,” says <em>Lifehacker</em>. From <a href="https://www.portent.com/blog/copywriting/use-markdown-now.htm">Ian Lurie</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>I once had to convert a Word document to a web page.</p>

<p>Once.</p>

<p>After spending hours deleting mso-style blocks and cleaning up thousands of lines of crap, I swore (and swore, and swore) that I’d never do that again.</p>

<p>So I moved to <a href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax">Markdown</a>. For a writer who publishes mostly to the web, it’s perfect.</p></blockquote>

<p>Before I committed to writing in Markdown and moved <em>Extratone</em> to <a href="https://write.as/about">Write.As</a> – a wonderfully simple, open-source web CMS entirely based on Markdown – I really struggled with text formatting on <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20190126095147/http:/www.extratone.com/">our old WordPress-based site</a>, spending hours cleaning up text from Word, Apple Notes, Dropbox Paper, and Google Docs.

<p><em>Mashable</em> published <a href="https://mashable.com/2013/06/24/markdown-tools/">a formidable list</a> of Markdown editors in 2013, but many are since significantly out of date. Instead, I’d refer you to @awwsmm’s “<a href="https://dev.to/awwsmm/state-of-markdown-editors-2019-2k49">State of Markdown Editors 2019</a>,” which suggests <a href="https://joplinapp.org/">Joplin</a> as the winning pick. Joplin is open-source and syncs across devices using your preferred cloud service, but it requires that all notes be written in a monospace typeface, which I do not prefer. If you have a MacOS-running machine and/or an iOS-running smartphone, you <em>must</em> download and try an application called <a href="https://bear.app/">Bear</a>. It is quite simply the <a href="https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/1063486573197561857">most beautiful</a> piece of software – aesthetically and functionally – that I have ever seen, and therefore the most beautiful possible execution of a Markdown Editor. From <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/2/14785264/evernote-replacement-bear-app"><em>The Verge</em>’s Dieter Bohn</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>Bear uses a simple three-paned design. The largest column is devoted to your current note. A smaller column to the left contains your notes in reverse-chronological order, topped by a search bar. The left-most column contains notes that you’ve pinned, as well as any tags you’ve created to organize your notes — <a href="../../tag%253Arecipes.html" class="hashtag"><span>#</span><span class="p-category">recipes</span></a>, for example. I spent years trying to sort my notes into notebooks in Evernote, only to learn that what I really needed was a faster search box.</p></blockquote>

<p><div style="padding:56.25% 0 0 0;position:relative;"><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/192615466?color=00006b&amp;title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div></p>

<p>As much as I despise the term “seamless,” everything about Bear is its definition. For someone like me, it, alone, almost warrants a reversion to MacOS. If you have the correct platforms, I <em>require</em> you to try it. Unfortunately, there can be no true Windows or Linux equivalent without the work Shiny Frog has done to streamline Bear’s near-instantaneous iCloud integration, but there is one application that can literally simulate its functionality in every other way. <a href="https://typora.io/">Typora</a> is an infinitely-customizable alternative that spans all three platforms with a well-populated <a href="https://theme.typora.io/">themes gallery</a> (including an <a href="https://theme.typora.io/theme/cobalt/">actual copy</a> of my favorite Bear theme.) My installation is not nearly as <em>smooth</em> as Bear, but it’s technically more powerful – bad news for users like me who can’t resist fiddling. I’ve downloaded (and attempted to author/modify) a billion themes for Typora. Bear, by contrast, allows <em>just</em> enough stylistic modification (color theme, a choice list of 7 beautiful typefaces, and sliders for font size, line height, paragraph spacing,) without <em>any</em> access to its internal workings. In this way, it provides the perfect blend of customizability and minimalism. If you tend toward the latter, try an ultra-slim solution like WordPress’ <a href="https://simplenote.com/">Simplenote</a>.</p>

<h2 id="telegram">Telegram</h2>

<p>I ran a poll on both <a href="https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/1252322233181261824">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://mastodon.social/@DavidBlue/104032632147081656">Mastodon</a> yesterday asking “do you still email things to yourself?” Overwhelmingly, my “audience” responded “yes,” which is awfully surprising considering their demographic – young, techish early adopters. Though email is not yet “<a href="https://www.inc.com/john-brandon/why-email-will-be-obsolete-by-2020.html">obsolete</a>” – as envisioned by <em>Inc</em>’s John Brandon in 2015 – it has indeed been replaced by other software in many of its functions, <em>especially</em> the old Mail-to-Self practice. I cannot remember the last time I emailed myself anything – even to transfer photos from my cellular to my computer, as I used to do often. Instead, I use a private <a href="https://telegram.org/faq_channels#q-what-39s-a-channel">Telegram channel</a> to send myself photos, videos, links, text, and any other file up to 1.5GB! There’ve always been plenty of reasons to use the messaging app for general communication – especially since <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/02/24/telegram-saw-8m-downloads-after-whatsapp-got-acquired/">Facebook acquired WhatsApp</a> in 2014. Though press coverage of the application has all but dried up, I would argue there are now <a href="https://medium.com/@sirajea/11-reasons-why-you-should-use-telegram-instead-of-whatsapp-ab0f80fbfa79">more reasons than ever</a> to make use of Telegram in your day-to-day life.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.wired.co.uk/article/episode-256">As of 2016</a>, Telegram had 100 million active users, but it’s certainly experienced its <a href="https://www.abacusnews.com/digital-life/why-telegram-isnt-secure-you-think/article/3014398">fair share of controversies</a>. I see no reason to be worried about encryption or privacy at all, for that matter, for the vast majority of Mail-to-Self cases. If the files you’re sending yourself are sensitive enough to worry about, you shouldn’t be emailing them, anyway.</p>

<h2 id="other-stuff">Other Stuff</h2>

<p>If you’re the sort of person who regularly types out 500+ word text messages (or have to do homework/any real writing) on your smartphone, I have a secret to reveal to you: <strong>most smartphones still have Bluetooth keyboard support</strong>. It may <a href="https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/1144268334353047552">look strange</a>, but yes, you can use a full qwerty keyboard with your phone. Those of us who’ve livestreamed or used screenrecording software know that <a href="https://obsproject.com/">OBS</a> (Open Broadcaster Software) is an absolute gift from Gourd, but <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/31/21201043/streamlabs-obs-mac-streaming-twitch-mixer-facebook-youtube">these days</a>, it’s also easy enough for most computer users to make use of. I’d encourage everybody who can think of a reason to record their screen – to show somebody how to do something, for instance – to download and install it. Finally, I think every Windows user should look into <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/manufacture/desktop/compact-os">compacting their operating system</a> into just the essentials. “Compact OS” is really just a Windows 10 install without <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/2966113/bloatware-what-it-is-and-how-to-get-rid-of-it.html">bloatware</a>: the shit you almost certainly don’t need. If you <em>do</em> find yourself in need of default Microsoft apps, you’ll be able to redownload them instantly from the Windows Store.</p>

<p>I’d been meaning to write something like this for a very long time, so I hope you or someone you know has found it useful. I’m not an authority in the technical sense, but I’ve used every one of these suggestions in my own computing life for years, now, to great benefit.

<h2 id="askeptical-spectacle-in-the-day-to-day-typhoon-of-faith-s-modern-enterprise">Askeptical spectacle in the day-to-day typhoon of Faith’s modern enterprise.</h2>

<p>The year I was given my first generation iPhone was the last of 14 through which my mother was still comfortable enforcing my obligation to attend Sunday morning church service. She and my stepfather had migrated 18 months or so prior from [Suburban Church of Mediocre Dope Christ-Appropriated Lukewarm Diluted Prog Rock and The Occasional Teachings of Protestant-ish Side-Glances at The New Testament] to the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/23/movies/how-the-true-false-film-festival-and-a-church-work-together.html"><em>New York Times</em>-appointed champion</a> of Columbia Missouri’s <a href="https://www.komu.com/news/mega-church-growth/">20-Year-Long</a> <em>Quirk the Church!</em> Sovereignty Crusade: <em>The Crossing</em>. Like its competitors (of which my parents’ previous church had ranked quite poorly,) the blatantly death-cult-sounding House of God includes its own artisanal, latte-equipped coffee shop (I wouldn’t be surprised if it’s <em>actually</em> a Starbucks affiliate at this point,) a regularly-replenished catering table full of doughnuts immediately to the side as one enters, and a sophisticated childcare operation staffed no less thoroughly than my public elementary school.</p>

<p>Since 2007, the church has been expanding from its first home (as a functional place of worship, anyway,) which lies within 1) line-of-sight from one of <a href="https://www.insidephilanthropy.com/dance/2013/7/31/nancy-walton-laurie-ballets-next-best-friend.html">Nancy Walton</a>’s properties, 2) a mile of the southernmost exit off US-63 – mid-Missouri’s primary North⟺South roadway – and includes a powered pump-arrogated pond, though the majority of the acreage is blackened by pragmatically-arrayed big box store-caliber multi-rowed parking. Ye, by night, it is flooded in coordinately-distributed cold white light suspended by the same uniform steel poles which guard long-term airport lots. Naturally, the entry and exit points for the asphalt spread are arranged deliberately opposed so that four figures’ worth of God’s children may be fed, digested, and evacuated through their weekly appointment with Christ as efficiently and <em>hassle-free</em> as possible.</p>

<p><iframe allow="monetization" class="embedly-embed" src="https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2F0rhSDfm1ZEc%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;display_name=YouTube&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3D0rhSDfm1ZEc&amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2F0rhSDfm1ZEc%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=d932fa08bf1f47efbbe54cb3d746839f&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube" width="640" height="360" scrolling="no" title="YouTube embed" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowfullscreen="true"></iframe></p>

<p>God’s ~white~ children become <em>especially</em> sensitive to entirely-trivial delay or other perceived deviation from Their Expectations when inside an automobile thanks to a rampant misconception that simultaneously allows them a renewed sense of control over their environment. Psychoanalytic observation has suggested it is catalyzed by delusions of physical anonymity, exemption from civic responsibility, and a titanically-inflated perception of their personally misattributed contributions to the perpetuation of the universe. This vehicular component of the customer experience is a fundamental ingredient in <em>The Crossing</em>’s stellar member retinenance record – the single metric above all quantifying a Christian organization’s overall effectiveness in accomplishing the faith’s (mostly cross-denominational) evangelistic Prime Directive / General Order Number One as <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+28%3A18-20&version=NIV">abridged by Christ himself</a> to the Pharisees after his resurrection: “go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of [The Holy Trinity].” I did not take the opportunity to sample <em>The Crossing</em>’s baptismal services, but I’m sure sufficient combing of <a href="https://yelp.to/qTKq/U3zCk0HlEY">the church’s Yelp! page</a> would yield as qualitative an analysis of such a “service” as you could possibly imagine. (Notably, it would appear the “lowest” review is <a href="https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-crossing-columbia?hrid=1iW1Q9KCi9WlM3mDzNFvKw&utm_source=ishare">the singular 4/5 star entry</a>.)</p>

<p>I do not mean to disparage <em>The Crossing</em>, specifically nor even organized religion, generally, but instead to emphasize the absurdities which have leapt just as readily into what I’d specifically call <em>The Business</em> of white protestant Christianity over just the course of my own maturation as it has into any other aspect of our lives. The difference, of course, is the universal set of exceptions – and the particular <em>age</em> of said exceptions – which religion maintains, societally. The perspective formed by my own experiences having grown up wholly embedded across the spectrum of white midwestern Christianity – including two years of vigorous and quite academic study of the Bible in a tiny private school headquartered in the basement of a Lutheran church – lends to a particular skepticism, amusement, horror, offense, and existential astonishment that latches my fascination into a not-entirely-voluntary hold.</p>

<p>(Before I go on, I suppose I should also note that it’s been at least two or three years since I last set foot inside the church building at all – my <em>only</em> recent experiences/engagement with <em>The Crossing</em> has been with their digital content from a relative distance.)</p>

<p><img src="https://i.snap.as/E5RLm4y.jpeg"/>
<img src="https://i.snap.as/B8TX5h0.jpeg" alt="Apple Leadership Headshots"/></p>

<p>The ludicrous parallels between Apple events and services at <em>The Crossing</em>, especially, come immediately to mind every single time I watch one (live or otherwise,) as they did just weeks ago when I first engaged with <a href="https://youtu.be/psL_5RIBqnY">this summer’s WWDC keynote</a>. Pastors <a href="https://www.thecrossingchurch.com/staff/dave-cover/">Dave Cover</a>, <a href="https://www.thecrossingchurch.com/staff/keith-simon/">Keith Simon</a>, and <a href="https://www.thecrossingchurch.com/staff/shay-roush/">Shay Roush</a> all look, dress, speak, and photograph <em>exactly</em> like Steve Jobs, Tim Cook, Scott Foristell, Jony Ive, and just about any <a href="https://www.apple.com/leadership/">public-facing leadership figure</a> we’ve ever seen giving an Apple Keynote. They’re hilariously interchangeable, as are other explicit aspects of the typical Sunday morning service at <em>The Crossing</em>. As far as I can tell, the church as a whole <em>only</em> uses Mac computers and the projections in the main auditorium/worship hall – mostly sing-along hymn lyrics and referenced bible verses – are exclusively created through Apple’s office presentation software, Keynote, just as the company itself does for its “Keynotes.” This was immediately obvious to me upon first entering that space because <strong>they both use the default theme</strong> – typography, color palette, transition animations and all. Indeed, during the sermons, the three pastors would take command of the slides by fairly inconspicuously clicking what I’d imagine must be a very sweaty Apple Remote in the <em>exact</em> same manner in which Tim Cook and his underlings still do.</p>

<p><strong>I JUST REMEMBERED DAVE EXPLICITLY USING MENTION OF APPLE PRODUCTS IN HIS SERMONS</strong></p>

<p><img src="https://i.snap.as/s1Qh8Rz.jpg" alt="The Crossing on WordPress"/></p>

<p>Nay, the likenesses do not diverge when comparing the fundamentals of the two organizations more broadly: <em>The Business</em> of the faith is very much a <em>volume</em> business, which also describes Apple’s contemporary strategy with perfect precision. It’s been a few years since “<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/ericjackson/2014/06/03/apple-isnt-a-hardware-or-software-company-its-an-ecosystem-company/">ecosystem</a>” ceased to be an exhaustive buzzword in tech media discourse, perhaps because the term falls very short in expressing the change in global Apple <strong>scale</strong>. My recollection of high school biology has failed to produce a scientific substitute, but I find Matt Honan’s “<a href="https://www.wired.com/2014/09/apple-ecosystem/">very lovely swamp</a>” exceptionally said in 2014, but the fact of the swamp’s becoming generally lovelier in the interim – in a less linear fashion than would have been ideal, mind you – leaves ample room, I think, to fear and respect whatever it was that we then called <em>The Apple Ecosystem</em> in 2014 as a <strong>ruling deity or daemon</strong> (just as <a href="https://extratone.com/google-soul-ledger-dont-be-evil">Google’s sought to be</a>, recently.)</p>

<p>I genuinely wonder quite often if the individual who set the digital template for the sign in front of our Portland neighborhood&#39;s Episcopalian church paused to look at the text he was arranging: “PRAYER REQUESTS BY EMAIL.” I&#39;m not sure any of this really means anything, but it&#39;s sure spectacular to look at.</p>

<p><strong>In case you&#39;re similarly long overdue for a reminder that beautiful things are still being made on the internet...</strong></p>

<p>After nearly a year of relative sobriety from my old, once-severe addiction to Web Site hunting, it occurred to me just yesterday that some explicit wandering as I once did for days at a time – through the clever, innovative, and uniquely tasteful projects through which an astonishingly-original few give their whole thinking (and often physical) selves in obscurity despite how little financial (and often professional) incentive is maintained by those who unknowingly need it the most – might be the best feasible remedy to my current, most perplexing state of faithlessness and bafflement toward the ambitions of trades and cultures I feel I once so thoroughly understood. A great portion of you are surely undergoing your own manifestations of the same hopelessness – I cannot <em>ever</em> remember a time in my life when global events were so <em>utterly</em> discouraging so relentlessly.</p>

<h2 id="design-and-the-open-web">Design and The Open Web</h2>

<p>In this present when every element of American reality is so much more incessantly ugly than we could’ve ever imagined, let’s take at least a momentary respite to look at some visually irresistible and/or <em>super sick</em> Sites on the truly-resolute Open Web to assure our existential selves that <em>yes, beauty shall not cease to exist</em>. For better or worse, my #1 goto source to find innovative, delicious web design has always been <em>Typewolf</em>, who <a href="https://www.typewolf.com/blog/goodbye-to-favorite-sites-posts">announced last fall</a> that he will not be continuing his “Site of the Month” section, though his relentless “<a href="https://www.typewolf.com/site-of-the-day">Site of the Day</a>” roll will continue, unhindered.</p>

<p>Those of us for whom the Podcast medium became a trusted and relatively regular one in our lives long before anyone figured out how to make a real business out of it – certainly <em><a href="https://www.macworld.com/article/1048271/podcastword.html">eons</a></em> preceeding the original startup podcast-only (apparently <a href="https://www.niemanlab.org/2015/07/gimlet-wants-to-become-the-hbo-of-podcasting-heres-what-its-founders-learned-trying-to-get-there/">HBO-like</a> publication – <a href="https://observer.com/2015/02/gimlet-media/">Gimlet Media</a> – to be successfully launched. Now, though, your mom – perhaps even <em>her</em> mom – listens to podcasts, and what was once a The single Missouri alumni at <em>The Verge</em>, Ashley Carmen, <strong><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/19/20699360/podcasts-business-advertising-revenue-serial-apple-spotify-big-picture">explored the proliferation of podcasting</a></strong> and the process by which it became profitable.</p>

<p>Whilst trying out <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/garageband/id408709785">Garageband for iOS’</a> new sample packs, I sampled the <a href="https://youtu.be/DvisTHAvaIE">accompanying video</a> to the article and produced <a href="https://soundcloud.com/chordoslut/everyone-has-a-podcast-none-but-god-are-listening/s-ICt6x">the best “track” I’ve ever made with the app</a> (for whatever that’s worth.)</p>

<p><em>Speaking of</em> Gimlet Media: <a href="https://gimletmedia.com/shows/reply-all/xjhx3l/146-summer-hotline">the latest episode</a> of my longtime favorite of their podcasts, <em>Reply All</em>, is a sort of condensed remake of <a href="https://gimletmedia.com/shows/reply-all/llhezj">my favorite podcast episode of all time</a> (of any show, not just this one) in which hosts <a href="https://twitter.com/AGoldmund">Alex Goldman</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/PJVogt">P.J. Vogt</a>maintained an open telephone line for 48 hours and spoke with a whole bunch of people (mostly Americans) about... whatever. The result was beautifully <em>human</em>, if you’ll forgive my use of the cliche. I tend to revisit it when I’m feeling particularly isolated from and/or confused about the general ambitions of the people around me. I’ll be honest: I didn’t pay much attention to my first listen through the new episode, but I can tell you that it is worth your time, at least.</p>

<p>I was distraught when Spotify bought both the aforementioned Gimlet Media <em>and</em> <a href="https://medium.com/anchor/anchor-is-joining-spotify-70356e3ac23f">the social audio turned podcasting app Anchor</a> – both of which I (rather ridiculously) felt a special personal ownership over. (The latter, especially, because they reached out to me early on to feature <a href="http://anchor.fm/extratone"><em>Extratone</em>’s channel</a> on their music section.) However, it appears that both are being treated fairly well in the 18+ months since their acquisition – probably because <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/31/20748337/spotify-earnings-q2-2019-podcasting-growth-users-subscribers">they’ve been making Spotify money</a>.</p>

<h2 id="premium-desktop-mastodon-clients-incoming">Premium desktop Mastodon clients incoming?</h2>

<p>Since you last heard from us, the federated social network <a href="https://extratone.com/mastodon-eugen-rochko-federated-social-network">Mastodon</a> has scaled tremendously in usership and steadily grown technologically into an incredibly robust and dynamic platform. Perhaps inevitably, Eugen Rochko and his gaggle of open source developers have continued to embarrass the living fuck out of Twitter&#39;s team – at least for those who&#39;ve continued to pay attention (i.e. those of us whose sense of aspiration has yet to perish.)</p>

<p>I planned on getting ahead of an innovative wake in iOS development by watching closely for the first “premium” Mastodon clients to come out, which I suspected (quite correctly) would carry the first substantial risk-taking on the part of plucky social apps to be seen on the goddamned App Store in what felt like eternity. Unfortunately, I&#39;ve ended up far too deep in screenshots/insights from <strong><a href="http://bit.ly/tootios">Toot!</a></strong> and <strong><a href="http://bit.ly/mastios">Mast</a></strong>, creating a bit of an overwhelming obstacle in comparing and/or reviewing the two without sinking deep in my regular, pretentious hole. (Though both of them are absolutely gorgeous, fascinating, and impressive projects which you should invest in and follow if you&#39;re interested in the future of federated social whatsoever.)</p>

<iframe height="350" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/k7KDk-VV6wc" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p><strong>That said</strong>... I&#39;d like only to mention and <a href="https://youtu.be/k7KDk-VV6wc">briefly demonstrate</a> the first premium <em>desktop</em> Mastodon client, <strong><em><a href="http://bit.ly/mastonaut">Mastonaut</a></em></strong>, which I had the privilege of experiencing momentarily last night.</p>

<p><img src="https://i.snap.as/hFeyH28.png" alt="Mastonaut Add Instance"/></p>

<p>In the interest of brevity (and because I was unable to continue fucking around for any length of time,) I&#39;ll just list some observations:</p>
<ul><li>The entire GUI experience is distinctly uncluttered (or perhaps <em>barren</em>, depending on your subjective desires from this sort of thing,) but duplicates dearest <a href="https://extratone.com/tweetbot-5-ios-review-twitter-client">TweetBot</a>&#39;s functionality impressively well considering its age as an independently-developed product.</li>
<li>Keyboard shortcuts! Fuck me, God.</li>
<li>I love the live-updated instance directory search (above) as a second landing for first-time users.</li>
<li>Though I did actually have to repeat the first-time login process after freezing and subsequently force-quitting Mastonaut, I think you&#39;ll probably place the blame on my own immediate and inpatient window management mania considering how smoothly it all went the second time around.</li></ul>

<p>To be honest, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/bear/id1091189122?mt=12">Bear</a>, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/spark-email-app-by-readdle/id1176895641?mt=12">Spark</a>, and recent other beautiful Mac applications beckon me to buy or hack myself into MacOS again. If I have time in the near future, I&#39;ll show you why.</p>

<p>Back in 2016, <em>Pokémon Go</em>, overclocked Apple Watches, pissing wearables, and What You See is What You Get blogging services all claimed unprecedented casualties among consumers according to <em>Futureland</em>&#39;s iOS 10 episode, which we did our absolute best to dramatize in order to survive what was expected to be the dullest event on record. We&#39;d only that day been first made aware of Boomerang photos and the mysterious nature of “Live Blogging” as an occupation. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/12/20/14016568/apple-airpods-wireless-earpods-earbuds-review">AirPods were introduced</a> and subsequently shit on, and the <a href="../../mono-audio-playback.html">comparatively archaic</a> 3.5mm analog audio jack was confidently parted with, finally. At least I got over “forgetting” about Live Photos because it&#39;s rapidly becoming difficult to keep stuff <em>on</em> the phone now. <em>I</em> am coming sincerely close to believing none of this is real, anyway. Today, though, it’s a damned straight ballgame, isn’t it? Months have passed since Apple pushed out its major mobile OS release of the year to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/1/26/10835748/apple-devices-active-1-billion-iphone-ipad-ios">more little rectangular computers</a> than any one person could speedcount in a lifetime and YouTube is already recommending me dozens of <a href="https://youtu.be/CXKqCWWjxSM">videos about the next one</a>. At this point, you and I are already aware of the iOS development community, who has already been using Internet Operating System 12 on their personal devices for more than half a year by the time your irises are landing here. Hopefully, all but two or three stranded, dying explorers in the arctic have updated their iPhones and iPads by now, and why wouldn’t they?</p>

<iframe src="https://www.listennotes.com/podcasts/end-user/siri-shortcuts-are-ios-12s--Vlsfa8engC/embed/" style="width: 1px; min-width: 100%;" frameborder="0"></iframe>

<p>Our expectations from this ritual are completely alien compared to those we’d need to anticipate from the event 5 or 6 releases ago, when one’s phone had to be sent away (in a sense) to latch itself tight to the stability of a desktop-class product in order to undergo a lengthy, destined metamorphosis. Sometimes, backups via 30-pin to USB-2.0 cables took hours, after which the custodian may or may not find their companion’s replication had completed successfully. If it had, one had to be sure to close any applications apart from iTunes to provide a working environment of utter silence – restarting after finishing the download was my own preferred method – before entrusting the despicably unreliable software to whittle away in a sometimes frantically rebooting, feverish procedure with near life-threatening stigma: it wasn’t uncommon for an update to inexplicably fail, “bricking” the subject iPhone and requiring that one take two whole steps in the wrong direction and restore it from the entire backup they’d just created (hopefully) in order to… make another, precisely-identical attempt, for lack of variables or alternatives to the process. However, if the user planned sufficiently and made a point to begin the whole charade immediately upon arriving home for the evening, these potential frustrations could be compensated for, and odds would favor counting on their smartphone to emerge safe and sound from the procedure just before bed, when even those holding the second-newest product in the lineage would have just enough screen time to notice that text entry, web page loading, and window management had noticeably slowed before sighing and tossing their device toward the darkness.</p>

<p>These days, one would need to try very hard to be inconvenienced by iOS updates. My iPhone 8 Plus is two or three times more powerful than my laptop at the moment, and my new friends’ WiFi connection is better than what the State government uses internally, back home. I haven’t needed to physically back it up more than once or twice since I bought it — iCloud stores the lot for $4.99­ a month anyway. I blinked once watching <em>Riki-Oh</em> with high school friends some time ago and all of the sudden, a 1.6GB download isn’t really a big deal. Siddown and watch your Instagram stories for twenty minutes, and <em>hey</em>! You’re ready to update! Somehow, I have abruptly found myself in a reality in which <strong>I am the obvious bottleneck</strong> and my 100 words per minute on a smartphone keyboard, even, is no longer fast enough: my fucking phone is now <strong>waiting on me</strong> when it updates. The keyholder is the whole goddamned holdup.</p>

<p>So, what possible purpose could there be in pounding out this “Review” of a free software update that’s in no way optional (waiting a month is no longer a rational minimization of risk — it’s just dumb,) not any more difficult to attain than the bills currently waiting in your mailbox, nor allowed by the nature of mobile operating systems to compete with any cross-platform alternatives? For myself, it’s proved <a href="../../ios-10-review-speed/index.html">a gratifying tradition of sorts</a> and a good use of my apparently-abundant time if only for the record&#39;s sake (hello, future web archivists, neohuman and otherwise!,) but this release – assuming I haven’t overlooked something – is the most globe-shucking of all because of one single featureset: <strong>Siri Shortcuts</strong>. However, the vast majority of the intra-Apple press&#39; coverage of this release has come across nearly as unconcerned with them as I was originally. Take <a href="https://www.macworld.co.uk/review/ios-apps/ios-12-3683670/"><em>Macworld</em>&#39;s iOS 12 Review</a>, for instance: it was the first result in my Google search for “iOS 12 review,” yet Siri Shortcuts are only mentioned in the bottom quarter of its first page. When I recorded the “<a href="https://radiopublic.com/end-user-WdbezM/ep/s1!ba096">iOS 12 Review</a>” episode of my “<a href="https://anchor.fm/davidblue">podcast</a>,” I spoke as if I was somehow the only person on the planet who comprehends the profound implications of this software addition – which was, of course, more of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/03/22/apple-has-acquired-workflow-a-powerful-automation-tool-for-ipad-and-iphone/">an absorbent acquisition</a> – but I have since discovered one gem, at least, which has continued the conversation in a most superb manner. It&#39;s <a href="https://supercomputer.transistor.fm/about">a technology podcast called <em>Supercomputer</em></a>, and it&#39;s hosted by <a href="https://twitter.com/AlexCox">Alex Cox</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/AlexCox">Matthew Cassinelli</a> – the latter of whom developed a significant amount of the iOS app <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/05/16/workflow-hints-at-the-future-of-the-watch-as-a-computing-platform/">Workflow</a> (and wrote most or all of its documentation, <a href="https://anchor.fm/davidblue">apparently</a>,) which Apple assimilated as Siri Shortcuts. Both are extremely knowledgeable and competent commentators on – as far as I can hear, at least – virtually <strong>the entire iOS *lifestyle</strong>*. (For those on the outside who&#39;ve never stepped in: laugh if you must, but yes it <em>is</em> a lifestyle, still, and it&#39;s new thought leader <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/3/18124416/tim-cook-apple-infowars-white-supremacy-podcasts-platform-adl">isn&#39;t exactly coming up short</a> these days.) iOS is technically <em>software</em>, yes, but it leaves an intractable itch for some greater, transcendent term.</p>

<p><iframe allow="monetization" class="embedly-embed" src="https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FpxtA9n2XwAM%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;display_name=YouTube&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DpxtA9n2XwAM&amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FpxtA9n2XwAM%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=d932fa08bf1f47efbbe54cb3d746839f&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube" width="640" height="360" scrolling="no" title="YouTube embed" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowfullscreen="true"></iframe></p>

<p>In just forty minutes, without any prior knowledge about this feature, I was able to create a Shortcut which sends any given handset&#39;s IP address and precise GPS location (among other mundane metrics) in a text message <strong>to my phone number</strong>. I could share this shortcut among my other submissions to <a href="https://sharecuts.app/">Sharecuts</a> or <a href="https://shortcutsgallery.com/">ShortcutsGallery.com</a>, where any iOS user could download and subsequently send this information back to <em>my</em> phone. (Don&#39;t believe me? <a href="https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/2873cc28684646e1904f0e80c21c8481">Have a go at it yourself</a> and I&#39;ll send back a screenshot if you&#39;d like.) I accomplished this without any particular skills or education in software development or cybersecurity – without any real <em>malice</em>, even – I was just playing around. As far as my recollection goes, Apple has <em>never</em> included such a powerful, potentially-dangerous piece of software in a standard software update before. It&#39;s both absolutely brilliant and sortof a ripoff to be so entrusted for the first time. In many ways – like my Disable Bluetooth &amp; WiFi shortcut – Siri Shortcuts represent an awfully half-assed solution to some of the most basic, longtime incongruencies within iOS. Sure, it&#39;s great that I can just make myself a shortcut to completely disable my phone&#39;s WiFi and Bluetooth activity with one press or Siri command (combining “type to Siri” with Siri Shortcuts basically enables a form of Command Line functionality in iOS,) but frankly, one should&#39;ve expected the world&#39;s largest company to <em>do it themselves</em> in perhaps the second of third version of this operating system instead of saying <em>okay, here are the tools – you do it!</em> in its <em>twelfth</em>.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve found it inevitable when speaking on iOS to avoid discussing the <em>other</em> literature available on the subject at any given time. The depth to which technology media has assimilated the habits and mannerisms of a single American company is absolutely mind-boggling, regardless of its history, its market share, or even its recent trillion-dollar valuation. Dozens of media companies – <em><a href="https://www.cultofmac.com/">CultofMac</a></em>, <em><a href="https://www.macrumors.com/">MacRumors</a></em>, <em><a href="https://www.macworld.com/">Macworld</a></em>, <em><a href="https://9to5mac.com/">9to5 Mac</a></em>, <a href="https://appleinsider.com/"><em>AppleInsider</em></a>, <em><a href="https://www.imore.com/">iMore</a></em>, and... more – exist solely to cover one single independent company: <strong>Apple, Incorporated</strong>. One wonders how the sum total of the individuals involved with and these organizations compares with the total number of employees working for the company their careers are (for the moment, at least,) entirely centered around. (Further interesting questions: are there any comparable situations anywhere else in Western capitalism, and if not – doesn&#39;t this sort of attention constitute <em>some kind</em> of Monopoly, even if it was not necessarily an anti-competitive one?) For “reasonable people,” the image one conjures up of <em>The All-The-Time Apple Beat</em> does not lend to envy, but let&#39;s choose to limit ourselves to only the most casual forms of speculation. I do not wish to mock them, for I, too remember the sensation of The Apple Drug from an unfortunate time in my childhood development when I was willing to wear a cheap sweatshirt branded with a stupid Mac vs. Windows Users joke unironically to a real live public Junior High school. There are few more embarrassing admissions, except perhaps admitting that a part of me genuinely yearns to return to this level of enthusiasm, as misplaced and cringey as it was. It&#39;s the addiction to the mystic; it&#39;s aspirational in its democratization. <em>Billionaires</em> are running the same operating system and much of the same software as I am every day – even the most followed person on any given platform is still accessing it through the same interface I might be. These are incredible truths, but they also reflect a dangerous lack of competition in a product category that has become more essential to day-to-day human life than any other in just three or four blinks of an eye.</p>

<p><em>Fuck David Blue</em>, though. Who are the <em>real</em>, <em>hard-hitting</em> minds who&#39;ve kept this industry and this company in check? Well, it&#39;s funny you should ask that, because the people&#39;s quirky <em>New York Times</em> tech critic of late – the esteemed <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/28/technology/how-to-survive-the-next-era-of-tech-slow-down-and-be-mindful.html">Farhad Manjoo</a> – has just <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/28/technology/how-to-survive-the-next-era-of-tech-slow-down-and-be-mindful.html">concluded a five-year-long technology column</a> with some essential (if perhaps a bit unoriginal) advice: “<strong>just slow down</strong>.” If you&#39;re still following along, you shall surely enjoy clicking some of his links, and I would certainly encourage that you do until you&#39;re out of free articles, at least. When Manjoo speaks, Apple listens: his January decree for Apple to bend with the industry wind and build “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/17/technology/apple-addiction-iphone.html">a Less Addictive iPhone</a>” is convincingly prophetic considering <strong>Screen Time</strong> – probably the most mulled-over iOS 12 addition. As someone who was diagnosed with Attention Deficit Disorder (however much or little that may mean to you) just one or two years after I began using my/the first iPhone, I&#39;ve developed a history of what he might call <em>Addiction</em> to iPhones in variable oscillation <a href="https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/1042825995546320896">touching both extremes</a>. I carried my first-generation iPhone for almost 5 years – as you can imagine, it was far from a 100%-functional device toward the end of that bell curve. In contrast, I&#39;ve also stood in line at dawn for two iPhone launches, jailbroken, listened to podcasts <em>only</em> about apps (far before they were good,) and been compelled to chronicle and reflect upon all of it for as long as I can remember.</p>

<p>There&#39;s no denying that the iPhone has had a profound effect on my life mostly thanks to my own choices, which is why it&#39;s worth telling the vast majority of you that features like Screen Time will never help you achieve whatever vague conception of <em>reduced usage</em> you may have. If you haven&#39;t yet quantified the figures you&#39;ll find within it in mental estimates, you aren&#39;t really concerned at all and if you <em>have</em>, Screen Time will only confirm them. Using reminder notifications to optimize your appflow makes no attempt at all to actually escape the mentality of the behavior you seek to lessen from yourself. Another app is still another app; a notification reminding you to stop using an app does nothing but add still more stimuli. If you want to stop using the phone so much, *<strong>stop* using the fucking phone</strong>. If you are truly concerned about how your handset companion has changed your life, turn it off for a week/month/quarter – however long you <em>possibly</em> can. By that, I mean no more or less than what you can manage without getting fired/dumped/expelled/etc. If you have <em>truly</em> reached this point, anything less is probably worth it. There is simply no other way to get a clear picture of how it&#39;s changed you.</p>

<p>Google, Facebook, and the rest of the industry are well aware of this, but know they can&#39;t <em>actually</em> advocate against the fundamental mechanism that drives their businesses, so they express concern by doing what they know: <strong>building more software</strong>. Apple is in a slightly different situation: they still need you to buy their phones – and even to look at them – but not past the point of hurting yourself emotionally, mentally, or physically because those injuries tend to hurt one <em>economically</em>. Screen Time&#39;s purpose is to keep us thriving and buying, but the only effective solve for this can only be communicated in garbage cinema language: <strong>you must find it within yourself</strong>. I am <em>actually</em> the worst person from which to model your life, except perhaps for my iPhone use: unless there&#39;s little else worthy of my attention, my phone is not out. Even if checking my <a href="mailto:davidblue@gmail.com">emails</a>, <a href="https://mastodon.social/@DavidBlue">Mastodon</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/neoyokel">Twitter</a>, etc. are my default tasks, there are infinitely many besides that come first. Every once in a while, it&#39;s okay to finish an important message while walking down the street or waiting at a stoplight if things are urgent, but I can guarantee you that my attention is better consolidated on traveling in 95% of cases – moving with purpose and then focusing on my composition <em>after</em> I&#39;ve arrived is almost always more efficient. I realize that I&#39;m cowboying it here and sound like your Dad, but I&#39;m better with iOS than he is, yet I&#39;ve never publicly run into anything while looking down at my smartphone in 10 years of hardcore use. <strong>Find somebody who&#39;s company makes you forget about all of this for hours at a time and treasure them</strong>. Also: <strong>stop playing games on your phone</strong>. <em>What the hell are you doing</em>? Read a blog! Explore the wonders of the open web! Your peers, your battery, and your elderly future self with thank you for it. (One exception is playing word/trivia games with your partner. That&#39;s very cute and good for you.)</p>

<p><em>I was elated to see that even Apple supports my <a href="https://twitter.com/i/moments/996616971880882176">age-old cause for Twitter Lists</a>. Also, the new function in Apple Music allowing the user to search by lyrics <a href="https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/1042825995546320896">appears to work very well</a>...</em></p>

<p>To get back to specifics, the <strong>new Photos application</strong> is now basically what it should have been all along, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/9/24/17896228/ios-12-keyboard-trackpad-cursor-3d-touch-iphone-ipad">3D Touch has been virtually eclipsed</a> for those strange bastards among you who never liked it, and the release&#39;s most democratically-redeemable feature is <strong>optimization</strong>, which even on my iPhone 8 Plus was blatantly noticeable and very welcome. However, probably the best insight to come out of my long, rambly <em>End User</em> review was the revelation that basically any other human activity is a better use of time than <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/17/17862236/ios-12-review-download-features-update-speed-iphone-ipad-screen-time-notifications-siri">applauding Apple</a> for learning to hold new features off until they&#39;ve been thoroughly tested and focusing instead on smoothing existing software. In fact, I&#39;d argue there is absolutely no reason for someone like me to say anything even remotely positive about the world&#39;s wealthiest company ever again, though that doesn&#39;t apply to <em>The Verge</em> or Chaim Gartenberg, who&#39;s review – for the record – was much more useful to 9999 times more people than anything I&#39;ll ever write. However, isn&#39;t it sortof unreasonable to expect anything but <em>absolute perfection</em> from Apple at this trillion-dollar juncture? A handful of varying interpretations of absolute perfection per product category, even.</p>

<p>With gorgeous, iCloud-enabled premium apps like <a href="https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/1063486573197561857">Bear</a> in the picture, integrating wholly into the Apple environment has maintained its relative rank above the alternatives to its specific minimal-esque utilitarian <em>niceness</em> which appeals so strongly to <em>those people</em> among both consumer and professional buyers. Readers from within this culture recognized a short time ago that <a href="https://www.wired.co.uk/article/ipad-pro-2018-review">iOS is in the process of replacing MacOS</a> as the star component of this environment across the board, though there&#39;s at least a moderate journey ahead before it truly reaches this achievement for the median user. For myself, iOS 12 improved the experience of using my 8 Plus and certainly gave me something intriguing to play with in Siri Shortcuts. For the rest of the world&#39;s billions of daily iOS users, I say <em>be as insatiable as possible</em> – always expect more.</p>

<p>On Win­dows XP bal­lot day, I spent <em>my</em> beat­nik-ass time mar­veling at the (seem­ing­ly) abrupt avail­abil­i­ty of some gen­uine­ly inno­v­a­tive social apps on the Apple App Store for the first time since iOS 7(?) Of course, I am aware that rea­son­able peo­ple would regard a “sneak peek,” NDA-vio­lat­ing, per­fect­ly Adobe Pre­miered app review to be pret­ty fuck­ing lame, and I won’t dis­pute any accu­sa­tions to the tune of “just an insane white guy with a Word­Press site,” but I still believe it’s impor­tant to talk about soft­ware <em>espe­cial­ly</em> because vir­tu­al­ly every­one uses it (as opposed to qui­et­ing down just when these apps and the peo­ple who make them attain the most advan­ta­geous pos­si­ble posi­tion to fuck the whole world.)</p>

<p>That said, I’m going to keep this as brief and unre­vi­sion­ist as I can: Tweetbot’s <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2018/10/18/tweetbot-true-dark-mode-gifs/">lat­est iter­a­tion</a> may actu­al­ly jus­ti­fy the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Tweetbot/">ded­i­cat­ed sub­red­dit</a> I’ve just dis­cov­ered! (Reddit’s the last place any­one wants to talk about apps, I guess.) I’ve com­plained at length about Twitter’s increas­ing­ly hos­tile (but <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/25/17274828/twitter-earning-q1-2018-profit-user-growth">jus­ti­fied, sortof</a>) treat­ment of its once <a href="https://mashable.com/2009/05/02/twitter-iphone-apps/#S_O.z..2mqqJ">aston­ish­ing­ly diverse land­scape of third-par­ty clients and tools</a>, yet I’d hon­est­ly grown sig­nif­i­cant­ly in accept­ing that the dynam­ic would nev­er again see the pow­er of the world’s most cash-stuffed com­pa­nies deliv­ered into the sweaty hands of small, kooky one and two-man teams, and it <em>nev­er</em> would’ve occurred to me that Tweet­bot was still around — much less get­ting ready to update its trusty old app with a release that would sud­den­ly make it clear­ly more sta­ble <em>and</em> bet­ter-look­ing than its last com­peti­tor: <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/twitter/id333903271?mt=8">the Native Fuck, itself</a>, which has also under­gone <a href="https://www.searchenginejournal.com/twitter-redesigns-ios-app-for-one-handed-scrolling/276541/">sig­nif­i­cant cos­met­ic surgery</a>, recent­ly. Name­ly, they moved the <em>one fuck­ing but­ton</em> that’s giv­en the app a usabil­i­ty pre­mi­um over its mobile web-based low-rent clone.</p>

<p>“The com­pose but­ton has been moved to the bot­tom right-hand cor­ner and “floats” as users scroll down their time­line. That means the but­ton is always avail­able to quick­ly send a tweet when the mood strikes.”</p>

<p>Yeah okay, <em>Matt</em>.</p>

<blockquote><p>We’ve got a shiny, new com­pose but­ton to unveil on Twit­ter for iOS! Eas­i­er than ever to use, the float­ing icon is promi­nent­ly dis­played and per­fect for one-hand­ed scrolling and Tweet com­pos­ing. Pro tip: Press and hold the icon to access your drafts, pho­tos, and the GIF gallery.

<p>Twit­ter Sup­port is no <a href="http://twitter.com/cher">@Cher</a>, yeah, but it seems strange that less than a thou­sand of Twitter’s <a href="http://bilge.world/media/birdearn.pdf">more than 300 mil­lion month­ly users</a> would both­er to engage with the announce­ment of a sig­nif­i­cant fun­da­men­tal change to its infra­struc­ture. Imag­ine if the fed­er­al gov­ern­ment announced via White House press con­fer­ence that every stop­light in the Unit­ed States was going to have its yel­low light removed to “stream­line work­flow” with­out any fur­ther expla­na­tion, yet only 1000 <em>total</em> Amer­i­cans even both­ered to tune in to the tele­vi­sion cov­er­age across all the news net­works. It’d be strange, yeah? Well, y’all are using Twit­ter more than you’re dri­ving, I’ll bet. Next time, <strong>get out and</strong> <a href="https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/1062859883211620352">vote on my Twit­ter poll</a>, you fascist!</p>

<p>In my Twit­ter glo­ry days — that is, when I used to spend the entire­ty of every one of my com­mu­ni­ty col­lege class­es Tweet­ing from my phone — there was a healthy offer­ing of third-par­ty clients on both mobile and desk­top that filled the eng­lish of the era’s soft­ware media with an absolute­ly bar­bar­ic brand-beat­en pile of lin­guis­tic Twit­trash. After Twin­kle — one of the <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2008/07/17/twinkle-another-twitter-client-in-app-store/">ear­li­est and ugli­est</a> ways to use Twit­ter ever — you’d have to choose between Twit­pic, Tweet­deck, Twit­ter­counter, Twit­ter­feed, Twhirl, Twit­turly, Twt­poll, Retweet­ist, Tweepler, Hel­lotxt, Twit­dom, Tweetscan, Tweet­burn­er, Tweet­vi­sor, Twit­ter­vi­sion, Twibs, Twistori, and Twit­bin. These are just a few I picked up from a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2009/02/19/the-top-20-twitter-applications/">10-year-old</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2009/02/19/the-top-20-twitter-applications/"><em>TechCrunch</em></a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2009/02/19/the-top-20-twitter-applications/">report</a> list­ing the top 21 Twit­ter appli­ca­tions by traf­fic.</p>

<h3 id="twibs"><strong><em>Twibs</em></strong></h3>

<p>Now, I have to stop myself from dig­ging too deep here and attempt­ing some­thing absurd like <em>The His­to­ry of Twit­ter Clients</em>, but the fuck­ing mate­r­i­al is there! I could spend an entire after­noon going through YouTube search­es and gad­get blogs because it brings me back to that time when I lived every day assum­ing these things were going to con­tin­ue to aston­ish for my entire adult­hood. So many incred­i­ble ideas! <em>How­ev­er,</em> I’m going to save them for lat­er and focus on the cream of the crop, so to speak: <strong>Twit­terif­ic</strong> and <strong>Tweet­bot</strong>, which has been a long­time favorite of mine. As I said, it was in com­mu­ni­ty col­lege that I first ponied up mon­ey for Tweet­bot 3 on my iPhone 4S sim­ply because the hype over it among app and gad­get nerds was <em>so bonkers</em> that it man­aged to spill over into my life, despite the fact that iOS7 and I were hav­ing seri­ous issues in our mar­riage.</p>

<p><iframe allow="monetization" class="embedly-embed" src="https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FDE1YHcoPxMk%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;display_name=YouTube&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DDE1YHcoPxMk&amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FDE1YHcoPxMk%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=d932fa08bf1f47efbbe54cb3d746839f&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube" width="640" height="360" scrolling="no" title="YouTube embed" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowfullscreen="true"></iframe></p>

<p>If you trust Mark Wat­son with your life as I do, you’d bet­ter believe that Tweet­bot has been “<a href="https://youtu.be/DE1YHcoPxMk">a scream­er</a>” since its very begin­ning, when it pio­neered the <em>Pre­mi­um Poweruser</em> seg­ment, for which a demo­graph­ic appar­ent­ly still exists. It was <em>fast</em>, yet always notice­ably smoother than the native app, just as the newest release is today. I must point out, though, that the blog­gers and YouTu­bers who’ve insist­ed that Tweet­bot or Twit­ter­rif­ic or any oth­er pre­mi­um app could replace the native Twit­ter app entire­ly on iPhone even before they were stripped of a most live/push func­tion­al­i­ty (which I’ll come back around to in just a moment,) are undoubt­ed­ly lying to them­selves — as good as they got, they nev­er over­took Twitter’s own app in imme­di­a­cy terms, which is almost inevitably going to present fun­da­men­tal deter­rence on the part of the active Twit­ter user who intends to rid them­selves of the default pedes­tri­an avenue of admin­is­tra­tion. Tweet­bot solved a lot of things, it real­ly is <em>daft</em> when it comes to noti­fi­ca­tions. It wouldn’t be the end of the world if they came a few hun­dred sec­onds late — it’s that they’re nev­er pre­dictably or con­sis­tent­ly so, which sev­ers entire­ly the human per­cep­tion of engaged <em>plugged-in-ness</em>, if you will. It’s the same phe­nom­e­na Chuck Kloster­man explores best in the con­text of DVRing live sports to watch lat­er.</p>

<blockquote><p>It’s dif­fi­cult to project fic­tion­al sce­nar­ios that are more oblique and unex­pect­ed than the cra­zi­est moments from real­i­ty. We all under­stand this. And that under­stand­ing is at the core of the human attrac­tion to live­ness. We don’t crave live sport­ing events because we need imme­di­a­cy; we crave them because they rep­re­sent those (increas­ing­ly rare) cir­cum­stances in which the entire spec­trum of pos­si­bil­i­ty is in play.
-“<a href="http://grantland.com/features/space-time-dvr-mechanics">Space, Time, and DVR Mechan­ics</a>” by Chuck Kloster­man</p></blockquote>

<p>Tweet­bot is unques­tion­ably a more thor­ough envi­ron­ment in which to explore Twit­ter than any oth­er third par­ty client, but it can’t do the live thing. (Please do com­plain to Twit­ter, Inc. about the API sit­u­a­tion if you’re so inclined, though.) All I’m try­ing to say is, <strong>there is no fuck­ing rea­son you’d delete the Twit­ter app</strong> — hide it away in a fold­er and nev­er ever open it again if it dis­gusts you so, but leave its noti­fi­ca­tions set­tings on so that it can keep itself busy in there. Now <em>that</em> is a smart work­flow! In fact, it was mine! And it did work for such a long time that you’d prob­a­bly for­get about the arrange­ment in no time were there not the occa­sion­al obvi­ous dis­crep­an­cies between Tweetbot’s Mention’s tab and the native app’s instant noti­fi­ca­tions. There has nev­er been — nor will there be, I think — a client for Twit­ter that can replace <em>some</em> use of its own prop­er­ties.</p>

<p>I think Tweet­bot 3 <em>made</em> me into my own ridicu­lous equiv­a­lent of a “poweruser.” Things are a lit­tle hazy now, but I know that I depart­ed my main Twit­ter account just before the app’s release, and I didn’t come back until 2015. I was going to school in the same old mall build­ing that housed the tool store in which I was also work­ing in full-time, which is sure­ly the only expla­na­tion for the shame­less­ness I demon­strat­ed in bring­ing a wire­less Apple Blue­tooth key­board to my class­es and plac­ing it behind the phone on what­ev­er sur­face was in front of me so that I could lean for­ward and type into iOS with my nose damned near touch­ing the screen. Strange­ly, I was not able to ver­i­fy when Blue­tooth key­board sup­port was added to iOS, but we’re going to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/iphone/comments/9y1bjd/when_was_support_for_bluetooth_keyboards/">con­clude for the sake of con­ve­nience</a> that it was first includ­ed in the imme­di­ate pre­de­ces­sor to the iPhone 4S I was using then.</p>

<blockquote><p>The cognoscen­ti have been on Twit­ter for years now. Stephen Fry, the web service’s patron saint — in Britain at least, joined in 2008. How­ev­er, it wasn’t until ear­ly 2009, xsome­where around the time that Fry tweet­ed while stuck in a lift, that the ser­vice went tru­ly main­stream. Men­tions of Twit­ter, usu­al­ly involv­ing celebri­ties, could be found in news­pa­pers and on break­fast tele­vi­sion.

<p>If you’ve made it this far, you’ve already seen the demos and skimmed reviews at least. You should know by now whether or not Tweet­bot 5 is worth it to you in pure­ly func­tion­al terms, but I think we should all acknowl­edge that <strong>this release of Tweet­bot is like­ly the last com­pet­i­tive third-par­ty Twit­ter app for iOS</strong>. The mess that is Twit­ter, Inc. has <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/official/en_us/topics/product/2018/investing-in-the-best-twitter-experience-for-you.html">made clear this year</a> that it intends to pri­or­i­tize its own clients over main­tain­ing the APIs nec­es­sary for oth­ers to receive push noti­fi­ca­tions. And when I say “its own,” I’m also refer­ring to our dear­est <a href="https://youtu.be/EHDOQVAQzec">Tweet­Deck</a>, which they in fact <em>absorbed</em>. From a busi­ness per­spec­tive, it makes sense: only “six mil­lion App Store and Google Play users installed the top five third-par­ty Twit­ter clients between Jan­u­ary 2014 and July 2018,” <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/08/17/6-million-users-had-installed-third-party-twitter-clients/">accord­ing to <em>TechCrunch</em></a>. I nev­er expect­ed to see Tweet­bot on the App Store charts again, nor would I have con­sid­ered that <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/echofon-for-twitter/id286756410?mt=8">Echophon</a>, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/tweetcaster-for-twitter/id420792544">Tweet­Cast­er</a> or <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/twitterrific-tweet-your-way/id580311103">Twit­ter­rif­ic</a> would have been left avail­able. They’re on the App Store, at least, and I can con­firm that they all tech­ni­cal­ly <em>still work</em>, but it’s safe to say they’re show­ing their fuck­ing age. Tweet­bot and Twit­ter­rif­ic, though, are not just satel­lite prod­ucts of the plat­form — they <em><a href="https://furbo.org/2011/03/11/twitterrific-firsts/">lit­er­al­ly built it</a></em>. These two are the poles that have spent Twitter’s life­time thus far demon­strat­ing for the com­pa­ny and its user­base their own respec­tive inter­pre­ta­tions of a mobile social appli­ca­tion. Today, they are unit­ed — along with <a href="http://klinkerapps.com/talon-overview/">Talon</a> and <a href="https://www.tweetings.net/apps/">Tweet­ings</a> — in a <a href="http://apps-of-a-feather.com/">plea for con­tin­ued access</a> to the plat­form they helped estab­lish on behalf of Twit­ter users and devel­op­ers around the world.</p>

<p>Both Tweet­bot and Twit­ter­rif­ic are in their 5th ver­sions, and nei­ther has actu­al­ly changed much since iOS 7. (Twit­ter­rif­ic appears to still be in the same ver­sion num­ber.) Fac­ing the grow­ing walls around the ser­vice, one strug­gles to imag­ine them sur­viv­ing more than one or two iOS releas­es, but <a href="https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/712292559058444288">I’ve been wrong before</a>. (In fact, I dis­cov­ered yes­ter­day that Look­book is <a href="https://lookbook.nu/mom">still around some­how</a>.) By the time iOS 7 came around, the new native Twit­ter app still <a href="https://www.cultofmac.com/246067/twitter-for-ios-7-released-with-new-design-icon-on-iphone-and-ipad/">looked fuck­ing ter­ri­ble</a>. When Tap­bots <a href="https://mashable.com/2013/10/24/tweetbot-3-for-iphone-review/#SDbMxlCvFPqx">released Tweet­bot 3</a>, every­thing about its visu­al expe­ri­ence was beyond any­thing we’d seen on the iPhone before and its effec­tive­ness as a Twit­ter tool was imme­di­ate­ly rec­og­niz­able in con­trast with even Jack’s brand-new app and mobile web expe­ri­ence. The ani­ma­tions were taste­ful and smooth and the “pro user” label on Tapbot’s demo­graph­ic allowed them to ful­ly explore the func­tion­al­i­ty of iPhone’s ges­tures sep­a­rate any bond with the hypo­thet­i­cal­ly least-capa­ble user.</p>

<p>This is a dynam­ic which I am appar­ent­ly unable to avoid across just about all of my sub­jects — includ­ing <a href="http://extratone.com/freq">dig­i­tal media</a> — so you may take it as gen­er­al­ly unrea­son­able or extreme, but I’m near­ly as tired of being treat­ed as an idiot <em>user</em> as I am an idiot <em>read­er</em>. <em>Read­abil­i­ty</em> is to <em>Usabil­i­ty</em>, etc. It’s espe­cial­ly aggra­vat­ing when I <em>could</em> do so much more if devel­op­ers would just assume I’m capa­ble of any knowl­edge acqui­si­tion or intel­lec­tu­al growth what­so­ev­er. Except for a few left­over key­board short­cuts, the native Twit­ter app’s only func­tion are the most obvi­ous to engage with, as per the high­est pos­si­ble stan­dards of use, which would make per­fect sense if it was paired with com­pe­tent invest­ments in <em>Acces­si­bil­i­ty</em>, but Twit­ter always appears to <a href="https://theoutline.com/post/2458/there-are-still-some-people-on-twitter-who-don-t-have-280-characters?amp=&zd=1&zi=zbzf6tkp">detest the sub­ject</a>, even while qui­et­ly putting in some of the work. Thanks to Mastodon’s explic­it and vis­i­ble acknowl­edge­ment of acces­si­bil­i­ty by way of just one young Ger­man man and a vol­un­teer team, we cer­tain­ly know it’s <em>not</em> because it’s an expen­sive one at all. (The “if Mastodon can do it than Twit­ter can <em>def­i­nite­ly</em> fuck­ing do it” argu­ment can be expand­ed almost with­out lim­it.)</p>

<blockquote><p>Some­where out there is a social media man­ag­er using a screen read­er whose pro­fes­sion­al­ism has been under­mined by the belief that the update is avail­able to every­one. We deserve equal access to the tools our peers take for grant­ed, and the secu­ri­ty to know that we will be able to do our jobs tomor­row regard­less of updates.
-Kit Englard for <em><a href="https://theoutline.com/post/2458/there-are-still-some-people-on-twitter-who-don-t-have-280-characters">The Out­line</a></em></p></blockquote>

<p>I would like to com­mend myself now for mak­ing it this far with­out men­tion­ing <strong>Lists</strong> — a sub­ject which I’ve already <a href="https://twitter.com/i/moments/996616971880882176">Tweet­ed</a> and <a href="http://www.extratone.com/tech/lists/">writ­ten</a> about exten­sive­ly — but this time, I have the won­drous bless­ing of two pre­miere mobile soft­ware com­pa­nies who rec­og­nized the poten­tial pow­er in list func­tion­al­i­ty to dis­pel or avoid most of the inher­ent risks assigned to the usage of a social net­work like Twit­ter and bet heav­i­ly on it. Nei­ther can be uti­lized to the fullest with­out lists and <em>wouldn’t it be such a shame</em> to not get your money’s worth? Tap­bots expand­ed their cura­tive abil­i­ty tremen­dous­ly by adding cus­tomiz­able fil­ters to any time­line in Tweet­bot, allow­ing the user to infi­nite­ly manip­u­late incom­ing posts with any com­bi­na­tion of every vari­able sup­port­ed by the core Twit­ter code itself. With­in a mat­ter of sec­onds, you could cre­ate a fil­ter that will exclude all Tweets except for those from unver­i­fied accounts that men­tion “blimps” and include a media attach­ment and apply this fil­ter to any of the app’s time­line views — includ­ing Home, Men­tions, Pro­file (your own Tweets,) your Favorites, and your Search­es — every­thing but your Direct Mes­sages can be sort­ed this way.</p>

<p>Tweet­Bot and I accom­plished a lot of sort­ing togeth­er, and it wouldn’t have occurred to me had it not crept to #1 Paid Social App again a few weeks ago that per­haps <a href="http://www.extratone.com/tech/lists/">my bias towards Twit­ter lists</a> could be entire­ly attrib­uted to my ear­ly use of Tweet­Bot and Twit­ter­rif­ic, which allowed me to amass a <a href="https://twitter.com/neoyokel/following">Fol­low­ing count</a> of over 5000 with­out phys­i­cal­ly per­ish­ing or men­tal­ly dis­in­te­grat­ing to the point of unde­ni­able insan­i­ty. How­ev­er, by the time <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/10/1/9432291/tweetbot-4-ipad-iphone-available">Tweet­Bot 4 was released</a> in 2015, it had long since swapped places with the native app with­in my iPhone’s home­screens and was only used when I felt par­tic­u­lar­ly like Tweet­storm­ing from a sta­tion­ary sit­u­a­tion. From my wire­less Apple Key­board, this meant Cmd (⌘)-N to com­pose a Tweet and ⌘-Enter to send it.</p>

<p>Today — <a href="https://www.macstories.net/reviews/tweetbot-5-for-ios-brings-a-redesign-dedicated-giphy-support-and-a-new-dark-mode/">in Tweet­bot 5</a> — this con­tin­ues to be a tried-and-true method of Tweet­ing Tweets on Twit­ter, smooth­ly and effi­cient­ly, as always. Return­ing to Ye Olde Alter­na­tive in 2018 yields both famil­iar <em>and</em> new­ly-imple­ment­ed goods: ani­ma­tion and audio noti­fi­ca­tions are car­ried over and/or updat­ed as need­ed to main­tain a flu­id and fresh expe­ri­ence. The abil­i­ty to switch between its intel­li­gent­ly-cho­sen col­or themes with a two-fin­gered ver­ti­cal swipe, alone will be jus­ti­fi­ca­tion enough for many users like myself to hand over anoth­er $4.99 to the Tap­bots devel­op­ers who’ve man­aged against all odds to one-up Twitter’s own mobile app devel­op­ment one last time. Over any oth­er alter­na­tive app, Tweet­bot 5 retains the robust qual­i­ties nec­es­sary to achieve #1 Paid Social App sta­tus on the App Store despite its new API shack­les.</p>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="book e-content"><p><img src="https://i.snap.as/9wsQDXz.png" alt="Opera No Connection"/></p>

<p><em>Opera&#39;s no-connection mascot is the cutest branding on any current web browser. Fight me.</em></p>

<p>Yesterday, I finished moving out of the situation I’d been living in for ~6 weeks in the basement of a southeast Portland home near the western base of Mt. Tabor. You&#39;d see it just across from the flat Washington Mall-ish grass rectangle that provides daring suburban explorers their most worthwhile reward for reaching the top. It resembles one of many local residential templates which I was completely unequipped to understand when I arrived in the area last year. You&#39;ll never observe any of its inhabitants outside doing any of the things people do when they are unaware of – or unconcerned with being observed. Walking by an afternoon front yard “family gathering” (young white parents and their one or two children) is a prospect of haste. Introducing new movement to the vicinity after the sun has gone down stirs a disruption from deep within its energy. Everyone in this town is afraid. I say it’s an unnatural way to live, but I’m just a fucking bumpkin.</p>

<p>As you may or may not have observed, the vast majority of my working being lives on the World Wide Web, which requires, fundamentally…. An internet connection. In most any other present-day first world circumstance, these are infinitely available, but I discovered – after the moving process was entirely completed, of course – that my tenants did <strong>not</strong> actually have an in-house connection of their own. They explained to me that their neighbor – an “IT professional” for IBM – had offered to let them use <em>his</em> WiFi network, and they’d found the arrangement sufficient. However, because IBM is <em>The</em> archaic marque of digital fascism (disclosure: they are also my <a href="../../compaq.html">sworn blood enemy</a>,) it wasn’t altogether a surprise when they told me that his offer did not extend to “guests.”</p>

<p>I considered that a defined period of WiFi fasting at home could make for an interesting experiment – perhaps even a needed mental reset – and I couldn&#39;t reasonably afford to acquire my own dedicated 4G hotspot, anyway. The reality became a relentless paranoid battle for any trickle of access – sometimes for <em>a dozen bytes per second</em>; for just the most basic digital communications like SMS and email – which led to more superstitious hypotheses about precarious antenna orientation, progress bar hallucinations, out-of-control frustration, and hopeless fixation with refresh commands than I remember from 2nd generation cell networks in the Midwest, 10 years ago, or even domestic dial-up, and truly revealed the extent to which I&#39;d taken connectivity for granted.</p>

<p><iframe allow="monetization" class="embedly-embed" src="https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fopen.spotify.com%2Fembed-podcast%2Fepisode%2F7wa3Ce5oJ2TNYkuknFx3s4&amp;display_name=Spotify&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fopen.spotify.com%2Fepisode%2F7wa3Ce5oJ2TNYkuknFx3s4&amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.scdn.co%2Fimage%2F5828f925b876268ec3d44c46ae85e92a2de2aaa5&amp;key=d932fa08bf1f47efbbe54cb3d746839f&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=spotify" width="600" height="232" scrolling="no" title="Spotify embed" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowfullscreen="true"></iframe></p>

<p>My observations of my own behavior throughout this drought are worth more than their mild amusement: even this petty disparity (I was never more than two or three yards from nearly-whole signal at the top of the outside stairs) re-sensitized my perspective to the abstract concept of network unreliability which I&#39;d been entirely spared since prepubescence. Though 4 billion human beings now regularly interact with the World Wide Web, their connections span a mathematically gargantuan spectrum of speed and reliability. In urbanizing myself as an adult, I have unconsciously latched on to the entitled ideal that internet access is a public service and accepted dramatically-increasing dependence on services that engorge greater and greater volumes of bandwidth without any explanation but their lack of incentives for efficiency. I reflect on my relationship with technology every day, yet I still became an oblivious data glutton in mind-bogglingly little time.</p>

<p>The current state of connectivity in the United States, alone is quite alarming under 5-year-absent examination. Mobile carriers are <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-sprint-corp-m-a-t-mobile-us/t-mobile-runs-behind-the-scenes-pr-push-to-support-sprint-deal-idUSKCN1L512A"><em>still</em> merging</a> and the compartmentalization of <em>all</em> ISP customers between prioritization tiers continues to be tested, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/24/17882842/us-internet-broadband-map-isp-fcc-wireless-competition">less encumbered by regulatory safeguards</a> than ever. I don&#39;t know my politics on this issue, nor do I have any specific solutions, but I&#39;d point to the work of the <a href="http://digitalinclusion.org/">National Digital Inclusion Alliance</a>, and express only that I hope the pace of the technology&#39;s progress is greater than the growth of its merchants&#39; imaginations and the scope of their greed so that the sheer volume of plenty overcomes even the shortest-sighted, and humanity as a whole continues toward a more just distribution of connectivity. What I <em>am</em> in a position to share are the revelations about our current infrastructure, software services, and hardware devices I could only have discovered from such an experience.</p>

<h2 id="variables">Variables</h2>

<p>I remember standing on top of a John Deere combine&#39;s 15ft-high roof in order to successfully make a telephone call 10 years ago – one of thousands of behaviors which were more abruptly and universally required for a few years and subsequently more abruptly forgotten than any other such united tick in American history. This blip of shared technological adversity also led to an unfathomably vast collective mythology surrounding incredibly tedious manipulation of our archaic handsets in varying degrees of desperation for <em>just one bar</em>.</p>

<p>My Sprint plan includes unlimited 4G LTE data for my iPhone 8 Plus with a 10GB tethering limit – which performed so admirably in the lonely role of my thin tether to the rest of the world that I am obligated to actually use the phrase <strong><em>like a champ</em></strong>, but the quality of its connection is dramatically impacted by the studio apartment&#39;s depth. From the space&#39;s geometric center at stomach-level, the handset indicates “1x,” meaning CDMA 1x, which <em>is</em> technically a data connection, but certainly not in any usable sense for the network applications of 2018. The native Twitter app, Apple Mail, Snapchat, Instagram &amp; Facebook, Safari, Opera Mini, Firefox, Chrome, and all others I tested in this condition would simply timeout – giving up after a minute or two of repeated attempts before declining to continue, each in their own minor variations. An interesting anecdote: in a pertinent reflection our human ballooning expectations for connectivity at all times, the language of our creations across both iOS and desktop applications has recently become noticeably less accountable and more accusatory. Instead of saying “____ can’t connect to the internet,” many of the browsers will declare an absolute: <em>there is no internet connection</em>, or just straight up <strong>blame</strong> the user: “<em>you</em> are not connected to the internet.” (Emphasis mine.) No apologies... No regrets.</p>

<p><code>Dude, no wifi? Where the fuck are U?</code></p>

<p>Directly above my head’s place on the bed, the phone could be propped on the sill of the East-facing window on a clear-skied day, enabling it to scrounge up and loosely establish enough contact to receive calls and text messages, claiming 1-4 3G “bars,” and a single in 4G at night, though one overcast Northwestern week basically did it in completely. If we were actually doing something to noticeably increase our old Nokia boxes’ bandwidth bids on those early networks by turning them every which way to find “better reception,” it’s completely futile on current devices. (I’m fairly sure I remember a network professional explaining this to me when LTE was first gaining traction.) It was immediately apparent that orientation had no effect, but the handset’s bearing certainly did… Most sensitively so. I realized quite early on that I should endeavor not to spend too much time standing in different positions throughout the space attempting to will on a browser loader bar above a story I’ve probably read already. Intstead, I committed to the very first position that indicated any correlation whatsoever with a better connection: atop the biscuit tin on the metal rack nearest the outside door.</p>

<p>It’s been three months, but I’m still using my tired old Hewlett-Packard 6930p <a href="http://bilge.world/linux-bitch/">backup machine</a>, so I was very skeptical about the odds we’d be successfully reliably pairing its ancient network adapter – <a href="http://a.co/d/ij9mfeD">now worth just $9.99</a> – with that of A Cellular Phone 10 years its junior without struggling significantly with range or reliability, especially considering that it cannot run a single one of its <a href="https://support.hp.com/us-en/document/c01538039">vast library of proprietary drivers</a> on Linux. You’d at least assume they’d need to be practically touching each other to maintain a smooth marriage, yet the only compromise I had to make on the local end was to bring them near to each other as they paired. Afterwards, I could return the phone to its tin and work on the laptop from the kitchen table, 12-15 feet away. (Curiously enough, the 6930p itself shipped with hotspot capability by way of the SIM card slot behind the unit’s main battery.)</p>

<p>Quantifying the speed of a mobile data connection as you would a dedicated WiFi network is incongruent because the former trades in a much less consistent packet stream. That’s the extent of my knowledge, but it’s easy to visualize: a signal that can travel a mile or two in big globules bound to be intercepted in splashes upon the device’s little antennae, versus your home network’s local, evenly distributed sauna of irradiated mist. It’s much less definite, to say the least, and I can’t actually comprehend the sort of voodoo that’s required in order to expand and maintain the networks as they are, nor would I ever wish to burden myself with such knowledge.</p>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="book e-content"><p><img src="https://i.snap.as/4HIp7Mwe.jpg" alt="Rod Canion Open Talk"/></p>

<p>If you&#39;ve ever found this industry&#39;s history intriguing, you&#39;ve likely heard Brian McCullough&#39;s superb <em>Internet History Podcast</em> before, and it&#39;s obvious to you how invaluable <a href="http://www.internethistorypodcast.com/2014/05/the-incredible-true-story-behind-amcs-halt-and-catch-fire-how-compaq-cloned-ibm-and-created-an-empire/">an interview episode with Compaq&#39;s Biggest Boy</a> would be for a head start on digesting the story. In accordance with <em>Halt and Catch Fire</em>&#39;s pilot release in 2014, the broad-shouldered soldier of open computing appeared to have been on a mini media tour (even though he openly admitted he’d yet to actually watch it.) [His last remark – “maybe even as exciting as the real thing” – may sound like silly Dork Rod conjecture, but the show wasn’t nearly as engaging because they had(?) to remove the <em>compatibility</em> component, which is the meat of the whole thing.] McCullough is usually ace at this stuff, but he sounds a bit shaky in this one, though nobody should blame him – I certainly would be, too. Rod Canion&#39;s accent (BIOS=<em>buy-OSS</em>) and general intensity must make for one hell of a presence, even over the phone. 2014 was a long time ago.</p>

<p>McCullough&#39;s own summary of the conversation is so thorough (he was writing a book,) there&#39;s only a single possible addition.</p>

<blockquote><p>“There&#39;s a certain risktaking gene that runs through a lot of Texans.”</p></blockquote>

<p>There’s no other way to say it: <strong>I believe in Texas</strong>. Specifically, Houston. DJ Screw, UGK, Z-Ro, Trae, Fat Pat, etc.– these I adopted as religion, years ago. From my perspective, Rod Canion’s ballsy, loyal Houstonianism hustle makes perfect sense. Yes, I’m afraid you’ve basically stumbled into my passionate cause to unite two Houston icons.</p>

<p>If you’ve ever thought to yourself <em>wow, Bandcamp has looked basically the same forever</em>, you were entirely correct – now for a tenth of the century, at least – and you’ll be hard-pressed to find another Silicon Valley technology company toting a venture-funded origin story with such casual, yet robust long-standing user relationships underneath an unwavering, bullshit-free commitment to their product. Even under the most ludicrous scrutiny, the company’s rudder is flawless and its course true. What at first glance you’d swear to be an unsolicited conclusion to an obscure examination could very reasonably be described as <em>cheesy</em>, <em>stubborn</em>, <em>dweebish</em>, <em>pious</em>, or just generally <em>boring</em>, indeed, yet the respective accuracy of each of these adjectives are no more than the byproducts of the very same operational ethics which we’ve suggested, requested, demanded, and begged the rest of the world’s computing capitol to re-adopt, enforce, or at least <em>ponder</em> for a beat. The volume of the masses’ exponentially-increasing attendance of late is only overcome by its hysterical shouting match, so let us pipe down for a while, now so that we may be precise as we dig deeper into the methodology which has finally led to a profitable, drama-free outlying technology organization without the need for a single drop of analogous sweat over its brand upkeep. By arranging the company in its infancy to so precisely and elementally align with the needs of its customers, the original troupe of Bandcamp Bums ensured profound and lasting simplicity in the single overarching priority for those in every single role behind the quiet perpetuation of Bandcamp dot com: <strong>selling good</strong> <strong>music</strong>.</p>

<iframe src="https://www.mixcloud.com/widget/iframe/?hide_cover=1&amp;light=1&amp;feed=%2Fdavod%2F%D1%82%D0%BD%CE%B1%D0%B8kf%CF%85l-f%CF%83%D1%8F-b%CE%B1%D0%B8dc%CE%B1%D0%BC%CF%81-2018-%D0%BCix%2F" frameborder="0"></iframe>

<p>The platform indiscriminately provides both individual artists and labels with a clean, cozy, charming, smartly-designed and technically competent storefront with a wide-open storage allocation, optimal search engine optimization and a widely-trusted point of sale experience in exchange for 15% of any sales that should come in – <a href="https://medium.com/@gloom303/a-year-ago-i-released-an-ep-on-spotify-itunes-and-bandcamp-this-is-what-i-l-earned-872925797930">significantly less</a> than other channels; <em>half</em> what Apple Music will take. In examining Bandcamp’s history, its impact on independent music, and its viability as an alternative streaming service, we shall excavate the truth behind the derisive cynicism directed its way by the titans of the tech and music press. Over the course of this super link-laden journey, we’d consider the alarmingly hypocritical possibility that it’s been overlooked by mainstream conversations only because it has so long operated in the precise manner we claim is so hopelessly absent from its neighbors in its deliberate, principled, and innovative journey towards a transparent, progressive vision.</p>

<p>To catch our starting gun, we must first travel to <em>Face The Music 2016</em> in Melbourne – as far as one can possibly get from The Valley – alongside Bandcamp’s super-worldly Chief Curator, <a href="https://bandcamp.com/andrewjervis">Andrew Jervis</a> to observe his interview for a live audience.</p>

<blockquote><p>Bandcamp has always grown extremely organically. There’s never actually been any advertising that we’ve done; there’s never any advertising on the site, and there never will be. We haven’t really tooted our horn very hard.</p></blockquote>
