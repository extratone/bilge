Considering my use of Git as a means to track revisions on my own writing, it's important to note that you should feel free to replace all instances of "software" in the above statement with "words," "writing," "expression," etc.

While I appreciate tremendously the work and contribution of [Arlo Bendiken](https://ar.to/2010/01/set-your-code-free) in the form of The Unlicense, I would like to add that I see no need, personally, to make the refutation of Intellectual Property law regarding my own work into some profound ethical statement. As it stands, I have not to my knowledge been the victim of any sort of theft of any kind, and find the suggestion highly unlikely. If I *am*  made aware of such a case, there is certainly a possibility that I may change my mind on this issue, so I suppose I should highlight that **THESE TERMS ARE SUBJECT TO CHANGE**, though I suspect I would be more flattered and/or amused than actually offended. 

I would also like to annotate that my use of this license should not be regarded as a suggestion that anyone else follow my example, or that I "believe in" taking such action regarding one's work, generally. While I did indeed take the time to set up [a repository](https://github.com/extratone/eoi) of John Perry Barlow's "[The Economy of Ideas](https://www.wired.com/1994/03/economy-ideas/)" in a bunch of different document formats, I do not necessarily agree with all of what he argued, especially in the context of the world 27 years later. If you *are* particularly interested in my opinion on the matter for whatever reason, here is what I have to say to you:

The principled beginning of The Open Web was a great moment in history, but - like all historical principles - it is extremely important that we consider *context* and maintain an appropriate level of criticism when looking back on old manifestos written by old white guys. In general, try your best to *be reasonable*.

</audio></p>

<p>For those of us who&#39;ve written about technology, generally, for quite a long time, any injection of the broader metaphysical/“ethical” conversation regarding the impact the industry has had/is having/is expected to have on our species into popular culture is inevitably an emotional event. <em>The Social Network</em> had an almost comical disregard for any potential function as a substantial critique of its subjects. Not that it&#39;s particularly supportive of that argument, but Mark Fuck, himself, recently <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/mark-zuckerberg-mentions-the-social-network-during-testimony-2018-4">said in court</a>, essentially, that he didn&#39;t know what the movie was about. I&#39;m not particularly sure, either. I suppose the dramatic film industry has no particular obligation to be critical of <em>the times</em>, but <em>documentaries</em> certainly should, in my estimation, and <em>The Social Dilemma</em> could&#39;ve done better, in that regard.</p>

<p>First, the <strong>actively misleading</strong>: As thoroughly as I enjoyed Peter Campbell&#39;s casting as the master-manipulating triplets behind the dramatized young man&#39;s screen, the film&#39;s depiction of this very human invasion of privacy is <em>blatantly false</em> imagery. The Privacy Problem is <em>not</em> that Facebook or Google employees are directly and actively viewing and manipulating your use of their services in real time. In fact, it is <em>ridiculously</em> unlikely that human eyes will ever see your individualized information. One could go so far as to describe the whole film as “ridiculous,” as did one of my favs, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/interface/2020/9/16/21437942/social-dilemma-netflix-review-orlowski-sarah-zhang-memo-facebook-buzzfeed">Casey Newton</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>The dramatized segments include a fictional trio of sociopaths working inside an unnamed social network to design bespoke push notifications to distract their users. They show an anguished family struggling to get the children to put their phones away during dinner. And the ominous piano score that pervades every scene, rather than ratcheting up the tension, gives it all the feeling of camp.</p></blockquote>

<p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/4/21419993/the-social-dilemma-jeff-orlowski-netflix-movie-review-social-media-algorithms"><em>The Verge</em>&#39;s official review of the film</a> – written by Adi Robinson and as cited by Casey – is an important read, as well. Robinson makes use of some very intelligent language and cites some very interesting bits (including a Wikipedia article about a series of Hogarth paintings?) for <em>The Verge</em>&#39;s audience, who already knew all of this. What I hoped to do by writing about this at all was speak to those distinctly <em>separate</em> tech media – grandmothers, retirees, etc. – who are both directly affected by the subjects covered by <em>The Social Dilemma</em> and particularly susceptible to its delusions about “privacy” – a term which I would argue is not particularly relevant to the conversation. Personally, I define my privacy in a way that is not violated by the simple <strong>collection</strong> of “my data,” regardless of how detailed said collection may or may not be, but would be by individual <strong>examination</strong> with human eyes, which – while possible – is extremely unlikely if for no other reason than a lack of business incentive. While Google may have access to the data it would need to determine whether I am currently showering or not, there is absolutely zero monetary gain to be had in one of its employees (or outsourced contractors) knowing this.</p>

<p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">you don&#39;t have to care about reforming privacy, intellectual property, or any of the other issues an alternative addresses – you need only to want a better and/or different experience.</p>— David Blue (@NeoYokel) <a href="https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/1283173322822488064?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 14, 2020</a></blockquote> </p>

<p>Now, on to the <strong>notably missing</strong>: Perhaps most important to note before I go on is that the film was produced by – and directly promotes on several occasions – one particular organization, called the <a href="https://www.humanetech.com/"><em>Center for Humane Technology</em></a>, which notably has a .com rather than a .org domain... hm. Immediately after watching the film, I complied with its direction to its website, where I was specifically looking for “solutions” to the issues it presented. Aside from Wikipedia (sortof,) it neglected to mention the abundance of alternative organizations and projects who&#39;ve been building against the adtech-funded web for ages – some for decades. Unfortunately, neither the organization&#39;s website nor the film&#39;s webpage list any of these alternatives, whatsoever, which personally leads me to believe <strong>the whole thing is bullshit</strong>, for lack of a better term.</p>

<p><img src="https://i.snap.as/6k9MzeE.png" alt="The Social Dilemma Newsletter Prompt"/></p>

<p>The film essentially argues for a single choice: using social media and other adtech-sustained services, or <em>not</em> using them. What I&#39;m here to tell you: <strong>you have a choice of services</strong>. For every single individual service criticized in the film, I guarantee there exists at least a handful of alternatives across a spectrum of sin. If you&#39;ve followed my work for any length of time (you probably shouldn&#39;t still be reading,) you know I&#39;ve advocated exhaustively for <a href="https://joinmastodon.org/">Mastodon</a> – the open web, decentralized social network outpacing Twitter in every single way. Two years ago, I spent <a href="../../bandcamp-streaming-music.html">an entire summer</a> arguing that Bandcamp is the only music streaming service who&#39;s business model benefits both platform and artist. I&#39;m still finishing up <a href="https://www.notion.so/rotund/David-Blue-vs-Big-Blue-9d82a679c93a41d78c6736e8a61e30e0">a massive essay that discusses alternatives to Facebook</a>, which has been an exhausting but educational journey, as you can probably imagine, namely that leaving a platform as all-consuming as Facebook for an open-source and/or federated alternative requires a certain amount of bravery. Essentially, the evidence suggests that the <em>alternatives</em> discussion is a particularly important one to me, as is finding a way to evangelize it that isn&#39;t immediately off-putting to “the average person.”</p>

<iframe height="265" src="https://clyp.it/oxpup2vm/widget" frameborder="0"></iframe>

<p>Poke around the film&#39;s official website a bit and you&#39;ll discover a variety of heavily-branded “resources” for “taking action,” all awash with a certain irony, including <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1juAZCcmRpNNjXajXnm0KOS-9fFUhPI3q/view">a fucking Bingo game</a> (hosted on Google Drive, no less,) which the site <em>actually</em> suggests you post on your Instagram story! Also under the “Take Action” vertical are links to Moment CEO Tim Kendall&#39;s <a href="https://www.thesocialdilemma.com/reclaim-your-screen-time/">tips for reducing your screen time</a>, the “<a href="https://datadetoxkit.org/en/home/">Data Detox Kit</a>,” which advocates for Firefox as the private browsing solution (among an indigestibly huge link tree,) a “Join Now” button, and – most ironic of all – a link to download the “<a href="https://adobserver.org/">Ad Observer plugin</a>,” in order to “share with researchers the ads you see on social media as they work to expose micro-targeting techniques &amp; hold political advertisers accountable.” In other words, the very same data collection the film condemns, albeit for the “Online Political Transparency Project” instead of the greater adtech monstrosity.</p>

<p><img src="https://i.snap.as/gf22b9R.png" alt="The Social Dilemma Bingo"/></p>

<p>No, it&#39;s not a scam. Using <em>The Markup</em>&#39;s shiny new <a href="https://themarkup.org/blacklight">Blacklight tool</a>, I found thesocialdilemma.com to be entirely free of any malicious tracking aside from the inevitable accompaniment to their Google Drive embeds. (Here&#39;s <a href="https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/893e4684-462b-4548-92ad-b85f240d0e85/report.html?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=AKIAT73L2G45O3KS52Y5%2F20201001%2Fus-west-2%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20201001T204417Z&X-Amz-Expires=86400&X-Amz-Signature=98001ad78557d11b12dda1347cb193c252f54a81b00547970717080c06bf04eb&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&response-content-disposition=filename+%3D%22report.html%22">the report in full</a>.) All at once, we can be virtually certain there is no <em>malice</em> in this particular destination, at least, which leaves... incompetence? I&#39;m afraid so. It is not revolutionary to suppose that the people who conceived of these ruthlessly effective systems of adtech and figure out how to implement them in the real world – regardless of what they believe now, or then – that these folks should not be our first call when we&#39;re searching for “solutions.” You know this, they know it, and they <em>explicitly acknowledged it</em> at least twice in the film, itself, and yet the fact of it remains.</p>

<p>Would you care to guess what <a href="https://datadetoxkit.org/en/privacy/essentials/#step-1">Chapter 1</a> of the <a href="https://datadetoxkit.org/"><em>Digital Detox Kit</em></a> is about? I can&#39;t imagine you&#39;d be correct... Under the heading “CONTROL YOUR SMARTPHONE DATA,” step 1 is literally just <em>renaming your phone</em>:</p>

<blockquote><p>At some point, you may have “named” your phone for <em>Wi-Fi, Bluetooth</em> or both – or maybe the name was automatically generated during setup.</p>

<p>This means that <em>“Alex Chung’s Phone”</em> is what’s visible to the Wi-Fi network owner and, if your Bluetooth is turned on, to everyone in the area who has their Bluetooth on as well.</p>

<p>You wouldn&#39;t announce your name as you enter a café, restaurant, or airport, so neither should your phone.</p></blockquote>

<p>Now, I&#39;ve always considered the ability to change a computer&#39;s name an immense privilege. My first “real” computer&#39;s name was Clementine, then there was Bertha, two Sophies (probably my favorite traditionally female name, so I excuse myself,) Silas, Linus, Uel, Jehoshaphat, Temba, Knot, and now Hildur. My iPhone 8 Plus&#39; name is Gravel. However, I realize that most users could care less, and I think that&#39;s completely rational. Technically, suggesting you change your phone&#39;s common name to that of “your favorite television character” (<a href="https://fortitude.fandom.com/wiki/Hildur_Odegard">Hildur Odegard</a> is my favorite character in <em>Fortitude</em>, so...) is <em>not</em> bad advice, even within its own privacy-centered argument, it&#39;s just that it&#39;s <em>ridiculously</em> low priority (or should be) compared with doing just about anything else along this vein. A conundrum is presented: I cannot imagine these people sitting down and seriously jotting down “change device name” as step 1 in their strategy, but I also cannot fathom an incentive for them to expend such effort facetiously or maliciously. Again, incompetence/ignorance is the only remaining explanation.</p>

<p><img src="https://i.snap.as/sEa9ojU.jpeg" alt="Firefox for iOS Notification"/>
<em>A notification I received while literally typing this out.</em></p>

<p>I have to backtrack, now, and confess that I <em>did</em> find an “<a href="https://datadetoxkit.org/en/alternative-app-centre/">Alternative Apps Centre</a>” within the Data Detox Kit, which contains some genuinely smart recommendations like ProtonMail, Riot, Signal, and DuckDuckGo surrounding a bunch of privacy-enhancing browser extensions. However, the “detox” seems to have been lost at some point along the way. No amount of privacy (yes, I do think it&#39;s hilarious that I can freely refer to “privacy” as a commodity with a positive quantity) can detoxify one&#39; social media addiction. The savvy reader notes the “Supported by Mozilla Firefox” badges all over the website and asks me “well, what did you expect?” My answer: something “more” than promotion, I suppose.</p>

<p>I suspect this is another case of <em>don&#39;t go to those who created the problem for the solution</em>. <em>More privacy</em> is a more tangible vector upon which to “innovate” than simply <em>putting down the fucking phone</em>, but the interviewees in the film at least touched upon a very important insight in that regard: <strong>turn off all your notifications</strong>. I genuinely believe turning off <em>all</em> notifications is a good way to proceed, especially if this film (or anything else, for that matter) has made you feel uncomfortable about your relationship with your phone. I realized that I&#39;d somehow allowed YouTube to clutter my notifications unconsciously for <em>years</em>, which is disturbing. In general, the apps who&#39;s notifications I&#39;d probably value the most (Bandcamp!) are the ones who use the feature the least/the most subtly.</p>

<p>Leaving your phone in a different room while you sleep is a good idea, though it seems a bit excessive when you could just <strong>turn it off</strong>, instead. (Displaced from your bed or stone dead, your chances of making use of your handset in an emergency are about the same, I&#39;d wager.) I suspect it&#39;s long overdue for a reboot, anyway. As far as “<strong>Email Addiction</strong>” goes, I suggest you first take an afternoon to go through your inbox and make use of GDPR&#39;s greatest gift: the single-click opt-out, most often found in very small text in a given email&#39;s footer. If you&#39;re <em>really</em> serious, unsubscribe from even the newsletters you <em>do</em> read and make yourself resubscribe to them. Make use of your preferred email platform&#39;s archives feature – or don&#39;t – but clear everything from your inbox itself. Mark it all as read. Then, you&#39;ll be ready to seek out other <em>Email Wellness</em> methodologies like the recently-trendy <em>Inbox Zero</em>.</p>

<p>If quitting social media cold turkey is not viable in your personal or professional life, <strong>a set daily time</strong> to check your notifications is a very good start. Yes, it&#39;s okay to announce on Facebook that you&#39;re taking a break from Facebook. There <em>is</em> a very good reason: accountability, to both yourself and your friends. If you are interested in the alternatives I mentioned before, genuinely <strong>contact me literally any time</strong>. My personal phone number is <strong>(573) 823-4380</strong>. I would be elated to discuss some of the services I&#39;ve discovered with you.</p>

<p>My own advice on “privacy:” don&#39;t worry about installing browser extensions, or using a different browser for that matter. Aside from a password manager, there is no need to download or install any additional software to protect your information. All the “privacy tools” you need are already present on your device, and they mostly consist of geolocation settings. If you&#39;re an iOS user, you&#39;ve already been confronted with them in the past few months. If you are still genuinely bothered by automated data collection unseen by human eyes, your only next step – if we&#39;re really honest with ourselves – is figuring out how you&#39;re going to go without the internet. Untracked browsing is no longer a realistic option.</p>

<h2 id="an-update-on-all-i-ve-been-doing-instead-of-what-i-actually-intended-to-do">An update on all I’ve been doing instead of what I actually intended to do.</h2>

<blockquote><p>There will always be plenth of things to compute in the detailed affairs of millions of people doing complicated things. – Vannevar Bush, “<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1945/07/as-we-may-think/303881/">As We May Think</a>“</p>

<p>Everything happens so much. – <a href="https://twitter.com/horse_ebooks/status/218439593240956928">Horse_ebooks</a></p></blockquote>

<p><em>You have a desire for indulgence in your home and family</em>, <a href="https://www.costarastrology.com/neoyokel">Co-Star</a> has just told me in my weekly, email newsletter-delivered horoscope. “Venus conjunct to natal Moon” indicates <em>this part of yourself will transform into something else</em>, and goes on to say something truly stirring: *<strong>the way you relate to your past is changing*</strong>. I continue to be amazed by how influential the potential of the computing hardware present in my life at any given time can be on my habits. In the two weeks I’ve had <a href="https://www.davidblue.wtf/hp-envy-desktop/">my first moderately powerful desktop computer</a> in over ten years, I have found myself using new image &amp; video editing software, installing local WordPress stacks, finally experimenting with Git, somehow generating 20 draft posts on <a href="https://www.davidblue.wtf/">a fresh experimental WordPress site</a>, and putting my whole back into my new Notion account, including – among others – projects like my “<a href="https://www.notion.so/rotund/Keyboard-Shortcuts-Wiki-9b4567d5b41447638cd6330aed7c2a1b">Keyboard Shortcuts Wiki</a>.” All the while, there has been a pull toward a more deliberate, focused sort of digital existence: reflection on <a href="https://www.kevinmcgillivray.net/word/">Kevin McGillivray’s Word of The Year concept</a>, <a href="https://tomcritchlow.com/blogchains/digital-gardens/">digital gardening</a>, and a few other like discoveries have culminated in a newfound, unironic use of the term “<a href="https://www.notion.so/rotund/Creative-Wellness-b43e3df6f4b94333aa97ea98b67cb760">Creative Wellness</a>” to describe a set of ideologies which I believe I should strive for in order to improve my intellectual wellbeing.</p>

<p>In tandem with the fact that I have <a href="https://www.davidblue.wtf/college-return/">gone back to school</a>, this has all crucially resulted in very little <em>actual writing</em>, which may or may not be conclusive evidence toward the classical minimalist technology argument that less capability results in more focus. On that note, remember when <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/5/14/5716232/george-r-r-martin-uses-dos-wordstar-to-write">the <em>Game of Thrones</em> author appeared on Conan’s show</a> and mentioned that he still writes exclusively using WordStar 4.0? This happening has been vaguely in the back of my mind since I encountered it during the relatively brief, basement apartment-dwelling era in Oregon when I first discovered WinWorldPC and got into running a bunch of DOS VMs, trying out every download from that blessed site which sounded even remotely interesting. Before I go on, let me just include a transcript of the entire anecdote I’m referring to here, because it’s actually much shorter than one is led to believe:</p>

<blockquote><p><strong>Conan</strong>: These novels that that you write are can be over a thousand pages long. They&#39;re massive tomes and apparently you write them all on a computer, but unlike most authors, you&#39;re not worried about a computer virus. I mean an author who writes a thousand-page book their greatest fear is a virus invades and destroys a chunk of their book you don&#39;t worry about that. Why?</p>

<p><strong>Martin</strong>: No I have a secret weapon – I actually have two computers: I have the computer that I browse the internet with and that I get my email on and I do my taxes on and that computer and then I have my writing computer which is a DOS machine not connected to the Internet.</p>

<p><strong>Conan</strong>: A DOS machine. How old is this program?</p>

<p><strong>Martin</strong>: A DOS machine. You remember DOS? I use WordStar 4.0 as my word processing system.</p>

<p><strong>Conan</strong>: Did you make this computer out of wood? Did you carve it? I&#39;m curious why you decided to stick with this old program.</p>

<p><strong>Martin</strong>: I actually like it. I mean, it does everything I want a word processing program to do, and it doesn&#39;t do anything else. I don&#39;t want any help. I hate some of these modern systems where you type a lowercase letter and it becomes a capital. I don&#39;t want a capital – if I wanted a capital, I would&#39;ve typed a capital. I know how to work the shift key. Stop fixing it!</p>

<p><strong>Conan</strong>: You yell at computers a lot. What about spellcheck?</p>

<p><strong>Martin</strong>: Oh, I hate spellcheck. Especially when you have the realm of [???], it&#39;s [???].</p></blockquote>

<p>That’s it! A less than sixty second exchange. I did not remember just how much coverage it received on digital news sites. Embark on a Google search for “<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=george+rr+martin+wordstar">george rr martin wordstar</a>,” and you’ll discover a ridiculously long list of brief stories including the YouTube embed. A book I’ve just recently discovered and begun – which I am extremely excited about – is Professor Matthew G. Kirschenbaum’s <a href="https://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674417076"><em>Track Changes: A Literary History of Word Processing</em></a>, and its introduction begins by mentioning <em>The George Thing</em>, which surely indicates that it is the most significant mention of word processing software in popular culture for at least a decade:</p>

<blockquote><p>The clip was posted to YouTube and from there embedded in innumerable tweets, Facebook feeds, and blogs. Some commenters immediately, if indulgently, branded Martin a Luddite, while others opined it was no wonder it was taking him so long to finish the whole story (or less charitably, no wonder that it all seemed so interminable). But what was it about these seemingly obscure details that people found so compelling? Part of it was no doubt the unexpected blend of novelty and nostalgia: Many fans would be old enough to remember WordStar for themselves, and the intricacy of its interface seems somehow in keeping with Martin’s quirky persona, part paternalistic grandfather and part <em>Doctor Who</em> character. WordStar thus becomes an accessory to his public image, like the black fisherman’s cap he is frequently photographed wearing. But it is also clearly much more than that. Martin’s passion for the program is unmistakable...</p></blockquote>

<p>The book, itself, was also more widely reviewed than one would expect, where it was deemed genuinely unique. I <em>related</em> quite hard to the preface’s first few sentences:</p>

<blockquote><p><em>Track Changes</em> began, as many books do, with a question: What was the first novel written with a word processor? Being an English professor interested in the history of writing as well as computers, I thought it was the sort of thing I should know, but I didn’t.</p></blockquote>

<p>Discovering the volume was a result of a personal determination in the last week to give in to my latent obsession with word processing/text editing software, which also led to my creating <a href="https://www.notion.so/rotund/0f3f754d5a4b46cb99bd3e1c0a2e1159?v=a85e98bc06424b72a3a249a87cb62101">a Notion table of every word processor I’ve ever heard of</a>. Thanks to my desktop PC acquisition, found myself virtual machining a bit again, though some of the programs I’m particularly interested in trying have inexplicitly disappeared from my personal library and been removed from WinWorldPC, probably due to (mostly absurd) copyright claims. Most versions of WordStar are <a href="https://winworldpc.com/product/wordstar">still available</a>, though, and I’ll confess I still have a desire to learn how to use its cult keyboard shortcuts, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2017/03/wordstar-a-writers-word-processor/">as evangelized by Robert J. Sawyer in an essay</a> <em>also</em> discussed in <em>Track Changes</em>, which specifically shits on WordPerfect more explicitly than I remembered. I keep returning to the idea that I should try writing the stuff I normally work on – like this post, for instance – in these software, but file transfer is a bigger and bigger obstacle the older the OS you’re running: VirutalBox’s “<a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch04.html">Guest Additions</a>” – which allow clipboard sharing/shared folders/other interoperative network functions – are not compatible with DOS or any Windows editions before 4.0. There are workarounds, but I haven’t found any reasonably within my current abilities.</p>

<p>Truthfully, though, emulating twenty-year-old software seems a bit unnecessary when contrasted with the fact that Markdown, Typora, and Writeas were <a href="https://write.as/community/chat-with-david-blue">supposed to be my saviors</a> from distracted writing. A compulsion to comment on a <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/tech-execs-are-obsessing-over-note-taking-apps-we-tested-them-out">recent note-taking app comparison published in <em>The Information</em></a> reminded me that I <em>still</em> haven’t written an in-depth review of Typora, which I plan to prioritize in the near future, especially since it may finally be officially releasing, according to <a href="https://twitter.com/Typora/status/1289586532353900544">recent activity on Twitter</a>.</p>

<p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">some gorgeous themes added to Typora&#39;s theme gallery recently. <a href="https://t.co/oFXop0W9ZU">https://t.co/oFXop0W9ZU</a> <a href="https://t.co/mZ3OwAqrv6">pic.twitter.com/mZ3OwAqrv6</a></p>— David Blue (@NeoYokel) <a href="https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/1307551063810158594?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 20, 2020</a></blockquote> </p>

<p>Another result of my reintroduction to academia is that I can now afford a subscription to Adobe Creative Cloud thanks to student discounts. This has been life-changing in a manner which I should probably be a bit ashamed of, but once the desire to <em>make full use</em> of my subscription (by trying every single program it licenses) subsides, I really do intend to become proficient with <a href="https://www.davidblue.wtf/t/Adobe-Indesign/">InDesign</a> – a learning experience which I will surely at least attempt to thoroughly document, here.</p>

<h2 id="digital-gardening">Digital Gardening</h2>

<p>I think it was <a href="https://tomcritchlow.com/blogchains/digital-gardens/">Tom Critchlow’s Digital Gardening blogchain</a> that first exposed me to the term and <a href="https://tomcritchlow.com/wiki/">his static site-generated wiki project</a> that introduced me to the concept of personal wikis, not so long ago, though the desire to organize and/or archive personally-relevant information through the format has actually been rattling around my head for the better part of a decade. When I discovered that one could install <a href="https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/MediaWiki">MediaWiki</a> – the platform Wikipedia, itself is built on – I created the shortlived <em>Drywall Wiki</em>, once upon a time. Since I last wrote you, I also purchased the <a href="https://extratone.wiki/">extratone.wiki</a> domain and played around once again with the platform. Typora even offers exports in MediaWiki’s bizarre proprietary text format! For better or worse, though, I don’t see anything becoming of the project for the moment I suppose it feels like somewhat of a risk, investing a lot of time I probably shouldn’t have into documenting all of my Twitter jokes. For the moment, I think my Notion account will have to serve as my personal wiki.</p>

<p>The most inciteful argument I’ve read among the Digital Gardens discourse revolves around <em>value</em> as it is created within our personal online writing spaces. Two of the many infinitely-quotable essays within this space: Mike Caulfield’s “<a href="https://hapgood.us/2015/10/17/the-garden-and-the-stream-a-technopastoral/">The Garden and the Stream: A Technopastoral</a>” and “<a href="http://snarkmarket.com/2010/4890">Stock and flow</a>” from <em>Snarkmarket</em>. The former references Vannevar Bush’s infamous “<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1945/07/as-we-may-think/303881/">As We May Think</a>” essay (which I’ve finally gotten around to finishing and its description of a “memex,” which many cite as a disturbingly-apt prediction of the World Wide Web. Caulfield, however, disagrees:</p>

<blockquote><p>So most people say this is the original vision of the web. And certainly it was the inspiration of those pioneers of hypertext. But in reality it doesn’t predict the web at all . Not at all. The web works very little like this. It’s weird, because in our minds the web still works like this, but it’s a fiction.</p></blockquote>

<p>Reading back from a lens including this commentary, I immediately understood. The <em>memex</em> concept is far more intimate than the web has become (or perhaps ever was – I wouldn’t know.) “Stock and flow” defines creative value in two disparate types of media:</p>

<blockquote><p><strong>Flow</strong> is the feed. It’s the posts and the tweets. It’s the stream of daily and sub-daily updates that reminds people you exist.</p>

<p><strong>Stock</strong> is the durable stuff. It’s the content you produce that’s as interesting in two months (or two years) as it is today. It’s what people discover via search. It’s what spreads slowly but surely, building fans over time.</p></blockquote>

<p>To be honest, I personally cannot imagine undertaking the task of explaining this differentiation to <em>anyone</em> in my own life, but if the reactionary movement within The Web back to a focus on <em>valuable</em> content is, indeed, underway, perhaps such conversations are bound to shortly become more and more natural. For my part, I have attempted setting up an experimental site on Github Pages using Jekyll in the past few days with partial success: as soon as I tried to specify a custom theme, I apparently broke it, at which point I realized that I had homework to do. As much as I hate to admit it, <a href="https://kevq.uk/static-site-generators-revisited/">Kev Quirk’s posts regarding WordPress’ <em>practical</em> simplicity over SSGs</a> earlier this monthrings somewhat true. As things currently stand, WordPress’ permeability throughout The Web is an <em>advantage</em> for those who just want to publish something as simply as possible. My counterargument to both Kev and myself: <strong><a href="https://write.as/">Writeas</a> is a wonderful compromise</strong> in terms of substance and <em>image</em> among one’s super e-enabled, Mullenweg-disgusted peers. It’s very much pure Markdown, but it’s far more accessible, cross-platform, than SSGs due to its shear simplicity.</p>

<p>One component which Digital Gardening would seem to offer others that I have never particularly struggled with is the freedom to write whatever I feel like writing. If anything, I have struggled in the opposite sense, existing in a state <em>completely unhindered</em> by consideration of the value my work may or may not offer anyone else. Perhaps the most substantial addition I’m capable of making to the Digital Gardens conversation, then, is best quoted from the first chapter of the advice book I have finally begun writing for young men, <em><a href="https://www.davidblue.wtf/writing/projects/piss/">For God’s Sake, Just Sit Down to Piss</a></em>:</p>

<blockquote><p>If there is one idea of mine you ever engage with – in this book or otherwise – it is best distilled in this single sentence: <strong>you do not *actually* want to attain a state of true apathy</strong>, trust me. It is extremely unhealthy, miserable, and alienating. I have existed for an excruciatingly long time trapped in a state of being truly unable to care about anything in the face of a great, varying effort to do so. It is very far from the immunity imbued in terms like <em>carefree</em> – in reality, it is manifested in extreme depression. It is less <em>immunity</em> than it is <em>distance</em> from an essential part of life.</p></blockquote>

<p>In terms of one’s blogging, I am glad for those who will/have/are finding a new freedom of expression, but hold this as a serious caution regarding the <em>other</em> extreme. Should you ever approach it, remember that <em>considering one’s audience</em> – as academics love to prioritize – really <em>is</em> important, eventually.</p>

<h2 id="curation">Curation</h2>

<p>At this point, I’ve used <a href="https://bit.ly/extratone">a channel in <em>Extratone</em>’s Discord</a> as my ongoing reading list for several years essentially without change. Earlier this month, though, I discovered Raindrop – a bookmarking service with public collections that (so fars) feels much more aligned with my own needs than Pocket – and pretty much immediately signed up to begin paying for it and set up a bot to crosspost from <a href="https://raindrop.io/collection/13380406">my new Reading List collection</a>, there to the same Discord channel via <a href="https://raindrop.io/collection/13380406/feed">the collection’s RSS feed</a>. Raindrop’s browser extension – along with Notion’s, come to mention it – is <em>actually usable</em> in day-to-day browsing. As much as I love <a href="https://www.reading.am/davidblue">Reading.am</a>, the prospect of its longevity worries me considering the most recent post in its <a href="https://writing.reading.am/">development blog</a> dates to 2016. Writing a dedicated “<a href="https://www.davidblue.wtf/c/software/little/">Little Review</a>” of Raindrop is on my (ever-lengthening) todo list, but at the moment, I would especially emphasize my <a href="https://raindrop.io/collection/13419360">Digital Magazine Collection</a>, which is the result of thousands of hours of web exploration and genuinely worth significant value for most anyone, I think.</p>

<p>With the combination of my public Notion workspaces and public Raindrop collections, I hope to make my curatorial endeavors both more accessibly beautiful and more intimately available. In terms of a dedicated discussion of Notion’s interworkings and culture, I think I have quite a bit more exploring to experience before I’m sufficiently qualified, though my notes are already quite extensive (and <a href="https://www.notion.so/rotund/Little-Review-Notes-228e10a1d3fe453fac69c9244a24ee3a">publicly accessible</a>, thanks to… Notion!) In general, I continue to be astounded by the amount of tools/services/applications I <em>have not yet</em> heard of, despite how long I have labored to become an authority on Writing Tools.</p>

<p><img src="https://i.snap.as/mPEMBma.png" alt="Too Many Fonts! - WordPerfect"/></p>

<h2 id="workflow">Workflow</h2>

<p>In my endeavor to more intentionally design my workspace – to actually dedicate a space for working, originally – I originally very much intended to set up dual displays for my desktop, but the desk I settled for (an old family piece from the early 1900s?) does <em>not</em> have enough surface area to position two displays, regardless of how thin they’ve become since I last had one. Combined with a limited budget and a concern that two displays might actually result in <em>further</em> distraction instead of less, I instead went for a single, 27” LED affair. I’ve also been making full use of <a href="https://www.cnet.com/how-to/how-to-use-multiple-desktops-in-windows-10/">Windows 10’s desktop switching feature</a> and have found it surprisingly easy to make a habit, especially thanks to the <strong>Ctrl+Win+Lateral Arrow Keys</strong> keyboard shortcuts.</p>

<p><img src="https://i.snap.as/lEx7zen.png" alt="Hildur Keyboard Shortcuts"/></p>

<p>On the subject of keyboard shortcuts, I’ve by now worked out a personally-optimized remap (thanks to the keyboard manager tool included with <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/PowerToys">PowerToys</a>, about which I have <em>far too much</em> to say in some future post.) I had <a href="https://mastodon.social/web/statuses/104843391967830863">a conversation with a few Mastodon friends</a> two weeks ago convincing me that my methodology of forcing myself to learn shortcuts by integrating a cheat sheet into my desktop backgrounds may actually be an <em>original idea</em> and useful to other users.</p>

<p>In terms of writing spaces, I have actually been composing the less serious stuff I’ve been writing within WordPress’ Gutenberg editor, which is <em>not</em> an admission I would’ve expected to be making, just a year ago. A dedicated post about this, too, is <em>fucking coming</em>, but suffice it to say that with a fairly-substantial PC and a better hosting provider (DreamHost over GoDaddy, in this case,) composition has become <em>far far</em> smoother – improving enough to make it a viable space within which to pound away original stuff for the first time. Writing essays for academia has encouraged my return to Microsoft Word, once again, on which I’ll blame the fact that I am currently composing this very bit in The Old Bitch. A desire to once again hack together a set of personalized Word templates has led to the birth of two such files which I am proud enough to <a href="https://www.notion.so/rotund/Configuration-2efccc31e19540c294b2bc5b7cfa4863">share on my Notion drive</a>. Eventually, I would also like to take the time to completely redesign the “Ribbon” in Word – something which I’ve literally never seen anyone else do. (I spent a substantial amount of time trying to find a library for MS Office customization files, to no avail, though you can find my own customization file as it stands on the same Notion page linked just now. Let me know if you’re able to successfully import it.)</p>

<p><img src="https://i.snap.as/gsVHo1z.png" alt="Woke Word"/></p>

<p>A confession of vanity: I suspect the only reason I haven’t yet stopped composing within WordPress is that I figured out how to change the typeface to Adobe Caslon (across both the editor and the front-facing site, naturally,) thanks to my newfound access to Adobe Typekit. Yes, apparently I really <em>am</em> that shallow. For those Office 365 users among you, I <em>highly</em> suggest you look up <a href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/turn-off-annoying-sounds-microsoft-office-2016/">how to enable the Classic Office sound theme</a>. Unlike <em>Make Use Of</em>, I find them both adorable and genuinely useful as auditory feedback. You may also be interested in my discovery of <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/style-guide/bias-free-communication">some fairly-Woke additions</a> to Word’s autocorrect options and the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/tech/microsoft-ai-word-politically-correct">subsequent bitchy controversy</a> their introduction spawned.</p>

<h2 id="the-read-it-website">The Read-It Website</h2>

<p>If you know me at all, the following admission probably seems unbelievable: I have been <em>using Reddit</em>. I created a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/extratown/">new subreddit for <em>Extratone</em></a> – which I do not necessarily expect to be populated any time soon – and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/softwarehistory">r/SoftwareHistory</a> after discovering that it didn’t yet exist, which I <em>definitely</em> do not expect you to populate, but would be delighted if you did. As with seemingly everything else I’ve covered, I <em>also</em> intend to write about how Reddit’s recent feature additions and redesign may <em>actually</em> make it a redeemable space on The Web, which should prove interesting. Clearly, I have become more than willing to accept the moniker of <em>Software Historian</em> whenever/if ever my authority achieves the appropriate volume to deserve to be christened so.</p>

<p>Obviously, none of the developments I’ve shared in this post indicate any improvement in my productive output, but I hope to learn soon how to settle into a fairly-consistent (and hopefully much more original) writing process.</p>

<p>It is my privilege and my curse to write about every new major iteration to Apple’s mobile operating system, though I skipped iOS 13 last year, which was largely dominated by Dark Mode, the iPad OS fork, and Memoji – which I could care less about, honestly – and didn’t warrant my investment in a Full Post, I felt. The Photos app improvements were very welcome, but I’d departed from iCloud as my primary storage service, so I didn’t have anything relevant to say. iOS 14 is also mostly irrelevant to my own personal use, but represents a more abstract shift in design philosophy that I thought was worth commenting on. For myself, everything about it adds anxiety, beginning with the launch, itself, at <a href="https://youtu.be/GEZhD3J89ZE">Apple’s WWDC 2020</a>, which I watched, live, and <a href="https://twitter.com/i/events/1275137514609823751?s=20">Tweeted extensively about</a>.</p>

<h2 id="i-do-not-want-to-live-on-the-memoji-planet">I do not want to live on the Memoji planet.</h2>

<p>My technology writing over the years has largely centered around my awe and confusion regarding what I&#39;ve perceived as a divergent path from the future I once imagined. My closest guess as to this divergence&#39;s origin is the announcement of iOS7, with Apple&#39;s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/shortcuts/2013/jun/12/skeuomorphism-apple-ditched-ios7">abandonment of skeuomorphic design</a> in favor of an entirely new, “flatter” UX visual language, which I actually found quite jarring. <a href="https://snap.as/extratone/retrospective">In retrospect</a>, though, of course I&#39;m glad they did so. I thought this was an importat preface to any thoughts I have about <a href="https://youtu.be/GEZhD3J89ZE">today&#39;s WWDC Keynote</a> – they will probably seem idiotic in a year or so (they might to you already.)</p>

<p><iframe allow="monetization" class="embedly-embed" src="https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2Fi243Fn1HwOY%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;display_name=YouTube&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3Di243Fn1HwOY&amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2Fi243Fn1HwOY%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=d932fa08bf1f47efbbe54cb3d746839f&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube" width="640" height="360" scrolling="no" title="YouTube embed" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowfullscreen="true"></iframe></p>

<p>Thanks to The Big Beer Virus, this was Apple&#39;s first pre-recorded WWDC presentation (though the word “live” continued to be used on several occasions,) which made it especially surreal. During the wait for the Keynote to “go live,” the stream was occupied by an <a href="https://twitter.com/GoncaloCdM/status/1275110234000969728">animated Earth</a> from orbit. As the clock rolled over the hour&#39;s top, AURORA&#39;s “<a href="https://song.link/us/i/1457598185">Daydreamer</a>” faded in and we began to grow closer to this Earth, gradually revealing that it was covered with millions of floating memoji in various states behind their animated MacBooks. Like much of the event to follow, this scene became more and more anxiety-inducing as we grew closer to the mob (keep in mind that I&#39;ve never really found memoji cute, unlike plenty of folks.) Eventually, we changed pitch dramatically and plunged through a hole in the clouds straight toward the incenter of the spaceship at Apple Park, through the door, down the staircase, and into a completely empty – but fully lit – Steve Jobs theatre, where Tim Cook emerged on stage and almost immediately began to <a href="https://www.inputmag.com/tech/apple-wwdc-virtual-event-tim-cook-addresses-black-lives-matter-racism">address racism</a>.</p>

<hr/>

<p>That&#39;s what I wrote about WWDC. iOS 14 officially released five days ago, now, and folks are already showcasing some crazy homescreen modifications on Twitter in <a href="https://twitter.com/search?f=image&q=%23ios14homescreen&src=typeahead_click"><a href="../../tag%253Aios14homescreen.html" class="hashtag"><span>#</span><span class="p-category">ios14homescreen</span></a></a>. I would go into detail, but I&#39;m honestly not all that curious about the process, which is unusual. I hope more than anything that I am not loosing my curiosity or playfulness regarding iOS which not so long ago propelled <a href="../../siri-shortcuts-ios12-review.html">an exuberant exploration of Shortcuts&#39; capabilities</a> during their early days as an integrated Apple property with the release of iOS 12.</p>

<p>Basically, I&#39;m not going to do the full bit, this year, but I&#39;d like to address some of the notes I <em>did</em> take throughout the past few months of the developer beta. Notably, there is simply far less to iOS 14 that&#39;s relevant to my life, personally, than any other release I remember, <em>but that&#39;s okay</em>. It&#39;s just a wee bit more difficult to motivate myself to talk about it. If there&#39;s one definite statement to be made about this release, it&#39;s that <strong>it is <em>additive</em> rather than <em>transformative</em></strong>. As Dieter Bohn so elequently put it for <em>The Verge</em>:</p>

<blockquote><p>For the iPhone, the overarching theme is that they&#39;re finally letting it get complicated. The home screen starts simple, but it can be complex if you want it to and Apple&#39;s also finally putting different elements on top of other elements so you can see Siri on top of your current screen instead of taking over the whole screen.</p>

<p>“<a href="https://www.theverge.com/21317904/ios-ipados-14-public-beta-preview-scribble-home-screen-widgets-apple-maps">iOS and iPadOS 14 public beta preview: something for everybody</a>” | <em>The Verge</em></p></blockquote>

<p><em>Yes, I do find the title of that article quite ironic considering what I just articulated to you.</em></p>

<p>The title of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/24/21299924/ios-14-iphone-wwdc-2020-apple-home-screen-widgets-app-library-clips-pages-complexity">his penultimate review</a>, additionally, includes the summation “Apple is finally lettting the iPhone homescreen get complicated.” Yes... <em>Complexity</em>. I&#39;ll be honest: I&#39;ve actually had the opportunity to play around quite a bit with Android 11 thanks to Android Studio on my PCs, and I found it tremendously underwhelming as an alternative. On a virtual Pixel 3, the experience was functionally no more than a fucking <em>material design</em>-tasting, <em>slightly</em> varied execution of a smartphone operating system in comparison. I should disclaim, though, that these weeks with early iOS widget implementation – which represents quite a hefty chunk of this release&#39;s significance, I think we can all agree – have led me to the conclusion that I personally <em>do not believe</em> in widgets. Or at least – I do not have the usership vocabulary to even begin integrating them into my own handset-using life.[efn_note]I&#39;d elaborate but honestly, who cares, really?[/efn_note]</p>

<p>To focus a bit, let&#39;s look specifically at a <em>Gizmodo</em> article published this past Wednesday: “<a href="https://gizmodo.com/17-things-you-can-do-in-ios-14-that-you-couldn-t-do-bef-1844975020">17 Things You Can Do in iOS 14 That You Couldn’t Do Before</a>:”</p>
<ol><li><strong>App Clips</strong>: Oh boy... I&#39;m so physically, mentally, and spiritually exhausted. Just gonna say <em>no</em> to that one.</li>
<li><strong>Add widgets to the home screen</strong>: I&#39;m going to assume it&#39;s Android users who&#39;ve stigmatised dynamic home screen widgets as a desirable outlet of development resources. I simply cannot fathom any bit of data which would be truly be <em>constructively</em> consumed there, as opposed to unlocking the device and navigating to whatever application it originated from. Perhaps I&#39;m just old and slow.</li>
<li><strong>Send apps to the App Library</strong>: Directly related, actually. Still considering how I assume most folks actually navigate to applications that have been in folders or in secondary+ homescreens to date – that is, dragging down and typing a handful of characters into Spotlight search – I&#39;m not sure an alphabetized listing of all apps is really that useful. I know I&#39;m not alone on this one: iJustine expressed an identical assumption <a href="https://anchor.fm/samebrain/episodes/WWDC-Rumors--PS5-hype-and-Animal-Crossing-efmf8f">on an episode of her podcast, <em>Same Brain</em></a>.</li>
<li><strong>Hide some of your home screens</strong>: (I repeat the exact same argument.)</li>
<li><strong>Watch videos with picture-in-picture mode</strong>: Once again, I could definitely be showing my age, but what really constitues <em>watching</em> when you&#39;re talking about a fractional segment of a ~6 inch display? You may as well just be listening to the audio, right?</li>
<li><strong>Pin conversations in Messages</strong>: I&#39;m afraid the text conversation pinning feature doesn&#39;t really apply to someone like myself, who literally never messages anyone but my girlfriend and my mom. All pinning the conversations accomplishes for me is the obfuscation of the handy in-line timestamp found in the normal list view.</li>
<li><strong>Mention your contacts in Messages</strong>: Jesus... And we&#39;re still using fucking <em>SMS</em>?</li>
<li><strong>Add more variety to your memojis</strong>: I still have not figured out how to actually use memojies, practically, so...</li>
<li><strong>Get suggested smart home automations</strong>: I&#39;m sorry... What did you say? I&#39;m not familiar with those words.</li>
<li><strong>Get to bed on time</strong>: Clarification: “iOS 14 works with watchOS 7 (or on its own) to help you get to sleep at the right time each night, with reminders and Do Not Disturb options.” If you were truly <em>at all</em> interested in not being disturbed <em>or</em> getting lots of sleep, you wouldn&#39;t have spent $300 on a machine to strap to your wrist who&#39;s <strong>primary function</strong> is to disturb you!</li>
<li><strong>Translate websites in Safari</strong>: Christ... <em>Really</em>? How have I not encountered an issue with this before?</li>
<li><strong>Search inside apps</strong>: <strong>There we go!</strong> The first item on this list that suggests anyone at Apple <em>actually uses iOS</em>!</li>
<li><strong>Get more detailed weather forecasts</strong>: Dark Sky acquision... All this one does is remind me that Apple&#39;s self-restraint could breach at any time and essentially the only competent mobile weather app ever devised could die or be molested into irrelevance.</li>
<li><strong>Use your iPhone as a translator</strong>: Well... Yeah... Anything that convenienctly allows me to reduce dependence on Google, I guess!</li>
<li><strong>Get more facts from Siri</strong>: ...<em>lol</em><br/>
“Apple says Siri knows more facts than ever before, though it hasn’t offered up any specific examples of something it knows in iOS 14 that it didn’t know in iOS 13—you’ll have to try and test it out yourself. According to Apple, Siri now knows 20 times the number of facts that it did three years ago, and we haven’t been able to catch it out with anything so far.”</li>
<li><strong>Get cycling directions in Apple Maps</strong>: No! Cut that out!</li>
<li><strong>Plan a journey in an electric vehicle</strong>: I&#39;m not joking when I suggest that this fits perfectly into iOS 14&#39;s <em>Anxiety Mode Enchancement</em> theme: all this really means is <em>We&#39;ve added the new Apple Range Anxiety app</em>!</li></ol>

<p><a href="https://davidblue.wtf/columbiaguide">David Blue&#39;s Guide to Columbia, Missouri</a> renders surprisingly beautifully on a desktop browser.</p>

<p>Yes, there <em>are</em> examples of genuine progress. The Guides feature in Maps (seen above) probably could/should have been added a long time ago, but at least Apple executed it quite elegantly. I&#39;m could&#39;ve <em>sworn</em> sharing your ETA has been possible from within Maps since like... iOS 7 or something, but perhaps I was thinking of <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/waze-navigation-live-traffic/id323229106">Waze</a>. <strong>Wallpapers for CarPlay</strong> are one of those features that didn’t occur to me to want, but I did/do. Also – though my personal experience with CarPlay has been limited – I can definitely imagine more layout options (“Horizontal status bar”) will be useful in <em>fringe</em> use cases.</p>

<p>And that&#39;s it! All of my notes have now been crossed off! Now I can finally forget I ever spent time thinking about iOS this year... Gourd Bless.</p>

<h2 id="an-attempt-to-fix-a-windows-insider-build-issue-led-to-soft-bricking-my-surface-laptop-2">An attempt to fix a Windows Insider Build issue led to soft-bricking my Surface Laptop 2.</h2>

<p>I finally did it, ladies and gentlemen... I managed to break the Windows installation on my <a href="https://www.davidblue.wtf/t/surface/">Microsoft Surface Laptop 2</a> to such an extent that it has been unrecoverable. I am currently borrowing my mother&#39;s MacBook Pro and waiting on a Windows 10 installation .ISO file to download so that I can hope to mount it correctly on the last, shitty USB thumb drive I still have lying around.</p>

<p><img src="https://i.snap.as/GG9y4pmC.png" alt="Fuck Grammarly"/></p>

<p><em>YEAH, THAT&#39;S RIGHT BITCH.</em></p>

<p>I now suspect I began down this path a few months ago when I discovered <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2020/06/15/introducing-windows-insider-channels/">Windows Insider Channels</a> and rejoiced... As I&#39;ve discovered that one can relatively easily find a beta version of virtually <em>any</em> piece of software, it&#39;s become a bit of a habit for me. More or less unconsciously, I’ve ended up with an application library full of <em>Developer Beta</em> and <em>Nightly</em> <em>Build</em>-type shit. I don&#39;t think there was/is a single web browser installed on that machine that is not the given entity&#39;s “Developer Edition” which – considering most of the regular installs allow you to opt into dev tools, anyway – seem like they might be redundant. I don&#39;t particularly care, anymore – I mostly just love their icons. <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/developer/">Firefox Developer Edition</a>&#39;s logo is a blue Firefox(!,) <a href="https://www.microsoftedgeinsider.com/en-us/download">Edge Chromium Dev</a>&#39;s is... more interesting than the regular version. <a href="https://www.google.com/chrome/canary/">Google Chrome Canary</a>&#39;s icon is a surprisingly-tasteful variation of the company&#39;s usually-horrendous color palette.</p>

<p>What I&#39;m trying to say is... I have continued upon this habit of opting for unstable versions of software in a sort of defiance against the common sense notion that relying upon them is generally a <em>bad idea</em>.[^1] I suppose I was just <strong>waiting to experience any consequences</strong> from such a decision, and well... Here they are!</p>

<p>It all began when my Surface&#39;s integrated webcam became invisible to all applications that used a video input – including Microsoft&#39;s own Camera app and OBS. It showed up in Device Manger, where I did the generally-recommended troubleshooting task of uninstalling it completely (including its drivers) and rebooting to force Windows to reinstall it. It did so successfully every time, to no effect on the original issue. I also went into the Surface&#39;s BIOS menu, where its hardware devices are explicitly listed, and disabled/re-enabled the camera, to no effect. Normally, the absence of a webcam function would be more or less irrelevant to my day-to-day workflow, but now that <a href="https://www.davidblue.wtf/college-return/">I&#39;m partaking in “virtual” college courses</a>, at least one of my professors has pressured me to appear <em>on cam</em> as soon as possible.</p>

<p>On Sunday night, I decided to revisit the problem with greater commitment, diving into a variety of deeper troubleshooting steps which I do not recall. The crucial one, though, was my decision to use the System File Checker tool <code>(sfc /scannow)</code> with the added instruction to <em>fix</em> whatever errors it found.[^2] This drove my dearest little laptop into a cycle of self-diagnoses which results in an option screen including “Reset PC.” After trying virtually every other option, I decided to try resetting, only to be met with connectivity error messages after pursuing the “Install via Network” option, leaving the use of a bootable Windows 10 recovery USB as my only choice, in theory.</p>

<p>Another problem now arose: my mother&#39;s MacBook Pro is the only other machine I have any sort of access to at the moment, and MacOS no longer supports the creation of such a bootable USB for Windows via the Boot Camp Utility any longer. Nevertheless, I tried to make one by downloading the correct OS ISO and mounting it via UNetbootin, which didn&#39;t work. I then called <a href="https://www.colcomputers.com/">Columbia Computer Center</a>, who very generously agreed to make one for me and only charge me for the drive itself ($10!)</p>

<p>Unfortunately, that one hasn&#39;t worked either, so I&#39;m afraid I&#39;m just going to have to take the thing to them... <a href="https://www.davidblue.wtf/t/surface/">Stay tuned</a> for the Final Verdict.</p>

<p>[1] This is why I’ve always downloaded the developer iOS beta releases on my actual, daily driver handset.</p>

<p>[2] I’m pretty sure it was “-f” but I’m not going to do the research to verify that… Sorry!</p>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="book e-content"><p><img src="https://i.snap.as/2eB6JrY.png" alt="SoundCloud Tile"/></p>

<h2 id="i-ve-got-some-fucking-opinions-about-soundcloud">I’ve got some fucking opinions about SoundCloud…</h2>

<p>My friend Sierra has used SoundCloud almost exclusively for her music discovery, consumption, and recommendations, but has remained resolute in her unwillingness to financially invest in the service. As such, her listening is regularly interrupted by ads and limited to bitrates <a href="https://www.magneticmag.com/2018/01/soundcloud-lowers-sound-quality-uploads-half/">as low as 64kbps</a>. Since I was last employed, I have maintained a vow to her that I would pay for a subscription to SoundCloud Go+ – the premium <em>listener</em> tier of the service – with my own money, once I was once again in place at a steady job. This move would remove all advertising from her listening and <a href="https://help.soundcloud.com/hc/en-us/articles/360010227514-High-Quality-Streaming">up its bitrate to 256kbps</a>, among <a href="https://checkout.soundcloud.com/go">other benefits</a>.</p>

<p>Two nights ago, we were refueling her car in preparation for another one of our recreational drives into rural Missouri when I made the decision on a whim to simply signup for a trial of Go+ on <a href="https://soundcloud.com/chordoslut">my own account</a> using Apple Pay, mostly because I knew we’d be going out of effective cell network range and one of Go+’s most emphasized features is its ability to download music locally. (Since my Apple Music subscription expired earlier this year, I only have <a href="https://bigkrit.com/music/king-remembered-in-time/">a single album</a> actually downloaded on my phone.)</p>

<p><iframe allow="monetization" class="embedly-embed" src="https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fw.soundcloud.com%2Fplayer%2F%3Fvisual%3Dtrue%26url%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F255811428%26show_artwork%3Dtrue&amp;display_name=SoundCloud&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fsoundcloud.com%2Fkeithjarrettofficial%2Frio-part-v&amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fi1.sndcdn.com%2Fartworks-4o6X0NzCmNjZ-0-t500x500.jpg&amp;key=d932fa08bf1f47efbbe54cb3d746839f&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=soundcloud" width="500" height="500" scrolling="no" title="SoundCloud embed" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowfullscreen="true"></iframe></p>

<p>***
The above is what I wrote several weeks ago, just as I was beginning my trial period. Now, having experienced a significant amount of time as a SoundCloud Go user, I am a bit sad that my trial is over. To be honest, I fully intended to become a paying subscriber, but my PayPal account was $0.70 short of the $12.99 monthly fee when the first billing cycle came, two weeks ago. This is not a conclusion I expected to come to, as SoundCloud’s fundamental arrangement could not possibly differ any more from the music streaming service I long claimed as my ideal own: Apple Music.</p>

<p>One major worry I would imagine potential subscribers may have when approaching SoundCloud as a replacement for their single music subscription service would revolve around the extent of SoundCloud’s establishment music industry library. There’s no way your Dad’s Sunday barbecue playlist is going to be on <em>SoundCloud</em>, right? Strangely enough, I was unable to find a single track that <em>was not</em> in the library. From my own favorite <a href="https://soundcloud.com/keithjarrettofficial">Keith Jarrett’s archives</a> to <a href="https://soundcloud.com/dixiechicks/sets/gaslighter-2">the new Dixie Chicks album</a>, every bit of big time record label-distributed music I could conceieve of could be found aside the Go+ badge (though notably, neither of these showed significant playcounts.) As far as the app experience goes, I <em>swear</em> it got smoother as soon as I signed up for Go+. This is probably bullshit, but regardless, with the seemingly ever-widening disparity in the experiences of free vs. premium users, SoundCloud appears to be moving actively away from the former.</p>

<p><img src="https://i.snap.as/78HwnfKK.png" alt="SoundCloud Desktop Keyboard Shortcuts"/></p>

<p>I have long said (somewhat in jest) that <a href="https://soundcloud.com/chancetherapper">Chance The Rapper</a> is the only reason SoundCloud still exists.</p>

<blockquote><p>From a future historian’s perspective, the battle for the definitive name in independent digital music distribution has already won, largely thanks to its relationship with Chance The Rapper, who’s quickly become a “cultural influencer, thought leader, global star,” and one of my generation’s upmost celebrity champions. Obviously, there is little sense trying to determine whether SoundCloud <em>earned</em> his partnership or landed their popular association with his name as long as the artist maintains it publicly, while continuing to <a href="https://soundcloud.com/pitchfork/pitchfork-presents-in-sight-out-chance-the-rapper">give new meaning</a> to the phrase “serially likable.”
-“<a href="../../bandcamp-streaming-music.html">Bandcamp: Streaming’s Secret Savior</a>” | July, 2018</p></blockquote>

<p>If <em><a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/chance-the-rapper-soundcloud/">CNET_ was asking the question</a> a year before that Bandcamp essay, I think I can feel properly varified. What I’d really like to know, now: does Chance still feel the same way about the streaming service after the launch of SoundCloud Go+? Considering that I am far from a <em>real</em> music journalist, I do not have any more contact resources than you have. That said, I left [a comment on his Facebook Page](<a href="https://www.facebook.com/chancetherapper/posts/3299672310124810?comment=">https://www.facebook.com/chancetherapper/posts/3299672310124810?comment</a></em>id=3319045628187478). I guess we’ll see.</p>

<p>Some more technical bits: SoundCloud is now castable on Chromecast, but <em>not</em> supported by Apple CarPlay, for whatever that’s worth. Notably apart from Bandcamp and Apple Music and aligned with Spotify, SoundCloud is explicitly investing in algorithmic music discovery, which means its users are doing the curatorial work. <em>I</em> am doing/have done the curatorial work. That means the DnB crowd is going to receieve Toto recommendations, given what I sought out for this post. You’re welcome, and sorry…</p>
<ol><li>While I was surprisingly unable to find any Tweets or Evernotes further evangelizing Apple Music (I suspect I’m thinking of an old, untranscribed <em>Drycast</em> episode,) I found real magic in the service as I perceieved it: $9.99 a month for <em>all of iTunes</em>. 13 year-old me would considerthat one helluva deal.</li>
<li>Naturally, if you know of one, please do comment and/or <a href="https://www.davidblue.wtf/contact/">drop me a line</a>.</li>
<li>In fact, it is the only streaming app I found that _does not _have CarPlay support. Even Bandcamp and MixCloud for iOS do!</li></ol>

<h2 id="basecamp-s-hey-matters-and-not-just-because-it-took-on-apple-s-app-store-policies">Basecamp&#39;s HEY matters, and not just because it took on Apple&#39;s App Store policies.</h2>

<p>Something always worth celebrating: a considered, no-nonsense new effort to reimagine email. I&#39;ve lived through many notable milestones in this regard: <a href="https://youtu.be/vN4U5FqrOdQ?t=2321">Apple Mail</a> on the original iPhone, <a href="https://time.com/43263/gmail-10th-anniversary/">Gmail</a>, Readdle&#39;s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/5/29/8683775/spark-email-app-iphone-apple-watch">Spark</a>, and (yes, really,) the revitalization of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/4/17819636/microsoft-resdesigned-outlook-windows-web">Microsoft&#39;s Outlook</a>. Exciting innovations have abounded throughout email&#39;s history, but it&#39;s highly debatable whether or not any of them have really changed the way we use it in a profound way, yet I am unfailingly intrigued whenever somebody new comes along, so when I saw <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/15/21286466/hey-email-basecamp-price-availability-platforms-launch">Casey Newton&#39;s story</a> on <em>The Verge</em>&#39;s frontpage discussing Basecamp&#39;s <a href="https://hey.com/">HEY</a> before I got out of bed on the morning of June 15th, I was delighted to see an organization still had the courage to invest their confidence and resources into their Ideas About Email. Originally, <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20200510220647/https://hey.com/">HEY&#39;s homepage</a> included a prompt: “To get on the list, email iwant@hey.com and tell us how you feel about email. Could be a love story, or a hate story. Could be long, could be short. It’s your story, so it’s up to you.” Though I knew it&#39;d likely never be read, I decided to write them a letter about my personal history with email, which turned into an entertaining enough anecdote to publish here.</p>

<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UCeYTysLyGI" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>The real reason HEY continued to be so widely covered by tech media, though, was its challenge to Apple&#39;s App Store policies after one of its updates was <a href="https://www.protocol.com/hey-email-app-store-rejection">rejected by the marketplace</a> just a day after Casey&#39;s story was published. Much drama ensued – I have done my best to aggregate links to all the news stories on the subject in <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/extratown/comments/hbncn6/news_surrounding_hey_the_upcoming_email_service/">a thread</a> on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/extratown"><em>Extratone</em> subreddit</a> I recently started. I think <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/16/21293419/hey-apple-rejection-ios-app-store-dhh-gangsters-antitrust">the public resistance by Basecamp&#39;s CTO David Heinemeier Hansson</a> was probably a PR move, which is fine, but all I wanted to contribute was a review of the actual function of HEY, itself. After reading posts by some of my favorite bloggers, however, I think it would be redundant. Kev Quirk argued “<a href="https://kevq.uk/email-is-not-broken/">Email Is Not Broken</a>,” to which Mike Stone responded “<a href="https://mikestone.me/email-is-broken">Email Is Broken</a>.” Additionally, <em>Business Insider</em>&#39;s Lisa Eadicicco published an <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/hey-email-app-review-basecamp-inbox-2020-7">in-depth review</a> at the beginning of the month.</p>

<p>My singular commentary: I&#39;m worried that subscription services that exclusively accept large yearly sums like HEY inevitably become the “country club for the most self-important emailers in business” which Casey spoke of. I guess we&#39;ll see.</p>

<p><em>The following is an excerpt from <a href="http://simp.ly/p/lw0h0R">my letter to HEY</a> asking for a early-access invite.</em></p>

<h2 id="email-and-i-an-abridged-history">Email and I: An Abridged History</h2>

<p>I am 26 years old, so I suppose I&#39;m of the first generation that&#39;s never experienced life <em>without</em> email. I grew up on a farm in rural central Missouri and my dad was very much an early adopter. (You&#39;d be surprised how e-enabled farmers were becoming in the early 2000s.) I cannot remember life before the humongous satellite dish was anchored in our front yard. Long before I had any reason to be online (or really understood what that meant,) he began and ended every day sitting at in front of a CRT on a corner desk, clacking away on a cigarette smoke-yellowed plastic keyboard for hours. I did not understand why, then, but in retrospect I realize that he was corresponding with a huge network of neighbors, politicians, family, and college friends via email lists/chains and that he depended on it both professionally and personally in a big way. As a single man living at least an hour&#39;s drive from a city of any size, I suppose my dad was predisposed to have a rich online life long before his suburban peers, which normalized it precociously for me.</p>

<p>The summer before my first grade year, my elementary school became the first in the district to have a computer lab (also the first air-conditioned room in the building,) so my high school graduating class was literally the very first to have had any digital curriculum – and an email address(!) – for the entirety of our public school experience. Because of this, I think most of us were trained to think of email as a tool for school work – it was eluded to by our computer teachers that our school email addresses were being monitored to make sure they remained so (obviously, they weren&#39;t.) As we grew into 6th-7th grade, however, we all seemed to end up with personal email addresses. I consider myself lucky to have experienced a very brief window – before instant messaging/early social networks became mainstream and SMS became even remotely pleasant to use – when my middle school friends and I corresponded exclusively by email when we weren&#39;t on the phone.</p>

<p>It still sounds a bit silly to say, but I&#39;ve spent the past few years coming to believe more and more strongly that my first-generation iPhone changed my life forever in a profound way – <em>especially</em> my relationship with email. After watching <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/674796/how-to-archive-or-delete-a-facebook-group/">Steve Job&#39;s introduction at MacWorld 2007</a> live, I promised to skip a year of Christmas gifts if my mom would agreed to buy me one, and she did. Obviously, it was like nothing else I&#39;d ever experienced, and it completely changed how I responded to and thought about technology. Before smartphones, there was no checking email outside of time in the computer lab, which was intended to be quite strictly-regulated. I had a real advantage when I started bringing my iPhone to school – absolutely no one knew what it was (a bizarre thought in contrast,) including teachers. Suddenly able to browse and read my inbox in class, at lunch, and on the bus, my use and consideration of email was propelled far ahead of my peers&#39;.</p>

<p>When I started an online magazine in 2016, I don&#39;t think I could&#39;ve conceived of the extent to which running a modern media company – even one targeted toward tech-savvy, early-adopting youth – still involves email. I assumed that my audience rarely <em>actually read</em> from their inboxes and relied almost exclusively on social networks for content discovery, so I originally forwent any implementation of a newsletter. As I grew more and more interested in and engaged with the media beat, I was exposed to the email renaissance of the past 2-3 years thanks to services like Revue and Substack, saw that it was good, and decided to give it a try for myself. I launched our semi-regular newsletter in April, 2017 on the subjects of “<strong>Division</strong>, <strong>Art</strong>, and <strong>Media</strong>” and published a little over 30 issues over the course of 18 months. To be honest, I&#39;m not sure I&#39;ve ever had so much fun writing.</p>

<p>Very shortly after it began, I observed our general engagement quadruple, and – quite selfishly – found the process of aggregation to be soothing and very mentally restorative. It exposed some pretty horrendous media consumption habits of mine, but it also offered a painless solution to them. As soon as everything I read became a potential item in the newsletter, I wasn&#39;t just reading for myself anymore (or at least, that&#39;s the mentality it gave me,) so I could no longer afford to dismiss particular subjects as easily or to skim so recklessly. I nurtured a much less chaotic media diet and found myself absorbing <em>a lot</em> more of what I wanted to without wasting so much time burning through links. I ended up feeling more focused in other, unrelated areas of my life, too. Obviously, I love email for that, and I miss writing that darn newsletter so much that I continuously look for excuses to do something similar.</p>

<p>My former Tech Editor loved email perhaps as much, but she&#39;s definitely the only person I&#39;ve ever met who finds the medium as <em>entertaining</em> as I do. (If you&#39;re <em>really</em> committed, I just made a <a href="https://twitter.com/i/events/1272514574420500481?s=13">Twitter Moment</a> full of all the best stuff I&#39;ve ever posted about email – mostly jokes like “<a href="https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/921352650788130822">patron saint of email marketing</a>,” but there are one or two profound posts in there, too.) We realized one day that – aside from The Webbys – there are very few notable awards celebrating excellence in the email medium, so we decided our magazine would host the 2017 First Annual Email Awards. Unfortunately, I don&#39;t think anyone else had any idea what the heck we were trying to do, so we never received enough submissions. However, I noticed a great opening paragraph in the original announcement post which I thought made a worthy conclusion:</p>

<blockquote><p>Man has used electronic mail to intercommunicate, woo, build communities, topple businesses &amp; civilizations, embezzle money, spread worms, distribute cluttered, broken links to discontinued Orscheln products, feed infants, set climate control, confirm identities, check bank account statuses, and lie to exhausted, slightly-conceited, and <em>newly self-published</em> professors. That&#39;s right – These Trillions of simple digijewels have purveyed <em>every single possible category of human communication</em>, and it&#39;s still growing strong.</p></blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m excited to give Hey a try – I hope you&#39;ll consider inviting me early. I&#39;ll even send my feedback if you so desire it! If not, I&#39;ll probably end up trying a paid subscription, anyway hehe. Either way, let me wish the best of luck to your team. Win or lose, I&#39;m glad you&#39;re taking action on your complaints, unlike the rest of us.</p>

<p>Thank you!</p>

<p>Almost exactly two years ago, <a href="../../google-soul-ledger-dont-be-evil.html">I warned that Google was on track to replace God</a> of us all. Last month, <em>The Verge</em>&#39;s Dieter Bohn reported that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/28/21272543/google-search-results-page-experience-load-time-contentfu-paint-layout-shift-top-stories-amp">Google plans to begin accounting for “page experience” in its search rankings</a> beginning in 2021, later explaining in a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/21274502/vergecast-podcast-407-trump-executive-order-social-media-hbo-max-launch">subsequent episode of <em>The Vergecast</em></a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>Here is another example of the Chrome team coming up with a bunch of web standards and then the Search team making a bunch of incentives based on those standards.</p></blockquote>

<p>It was news to me that in May, Google <a href="https://blog.chromium.org/2020/05/introducing-web-vitals-essential-metrics.html">launched</a> a page called “Web Vitals” on its <a href="https://web.dev/vitals/"><strong>web.dev</strong></a> domain (which they&#39;ve <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20180415000000*/web.dev">apparently owned since November 2018</a>.) The company measures “page experience” based on three main criteria:</p>

<blockquote><ul><li><a href="https://web.dev/lcp/"><strong>Largest Contentful Paint</strong></a> measures perceived load speed and marks the point in the page load timeline when the page&#39;s main content has likely loaded.</li>
<li><a href="https://web.dev/fid/"><strong>First Input Delay</strong></a> measures responsiveness and quantifies the experience users feel when trying to first interact with the page.</li>

<h3 id="1-smaller-assets-are-ideal">1. Smaller assets are ideal.</h3>

<p>The simple assumption that it is always better to have the smallest page possible – that images should be resized and compressed to hell and typography/other elements should be few in number. Instantaneous page loads should be priority over any other standards of measure for a web page – like interesting design, for instance.</p>

<h3 id="2-minimalistic-design-is-necessary">2. Minimalistic design is necessary.</h3>

<p>The reality – for most of the Western world, at least – is that <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/kevinmurnane/2018/12/11/heres-how-internet-speeds-fared-for-the-worlds-fastest-and-largest-countries-in-2018/#3f3124664976">average network speeds are exponentially increasing</a> year-by-year. In 2018:</p>

<blockquote><p>World-wide average mobile download speed was 22.82 Mbps (Megabits per second), an increase of 15.2% over 2017. Average upload speed was 9.19 Mbps, an increase of 11.6%. Fixed broadband speeds also increased. Average download speed increased 26.4% to 46.12 Mbps, while average upload speed came in at 22.44 Mbps, a 26.5% increase.</p></blockquote>

<p>I may be a yokel, but these averages are still absolutely <em>inconceivable</em> to me. Our phones have as much RAM as my “studio” work desktop, now. 22.82 Mbps will reliably download <em>very</em> complex web pages nearly instantaneously. There is a very reasonable argument for essential services like search engines and news websites to conform to/adopt standards like AMP, but for the rest of The Open Web, ingenuity and risktaking should be <em>encouraged</em>, not discouraged, for the true good of all Peoplekind.</p>

<p>A term I haven&#39;t seen for a good while describes this ideology: “the <strong>mobile web</strong>,” and it completely sucking ass is not a new concept. I&#39;ve before referenced <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/7/20/9002721/the-mobile-web-sucks">an old complaint</a> from 2015 by <em>The Verge</em>&#39;s Editor-in-Chief, Nilay Patel (which the original article also links in different context in its last line):</p>

<blockquote><p>The entire point of the web was to democratize and simplify publishing using standards that anyone could build on, and it has been a raging, massively disruptive success for decades now. But the iPhone&#39;s depressing combination of <a href="https://www.netmarketshare.com/browser-market-share.aspx?qpcustomd=1&qprid=0">dominant mobile web marketshare</a> and shitbox performance means we&#39;re all sort of ready to throw that progress away.</p></blockquote>

<h3 id="3-google-has-the-right-to-dictate-best-practices">3. Google has the right to dictate “Best Practices.”</h3>

<p>The Mobile Web as a utility has its place, but it&#39;s certainly not a necessary or desirable ideal for the entirety of The Web, yet Google has the audacity to presume it can dictate what is and is not optimal web design. The URL in and of itself is extremely presumptuous – Google technically has every right to own web.dev, sure, but <em>should</em> it? The Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMP) program has already had an annoying effect on day-to-day browsing. I despise AMP links more than most things in life, just as I despise the name of the website <em>Search Engine Land</em> (which sounds like actual hell) who <a href="https://searchengineland.com/the-google-page-experience-update-user-experience-to-become-a-google-ranking-factor-335252">also reported on this</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>If you have AMP, the good news is that the majority of AMP pages do extremely well in terms of page experience metrics, [Google Project Manager] Rudy Galfi said. It doesn’t mean that all AMP pages will have top page experience metrics, but AMP is built in a way to help with this.</p></blockquote>

<p>Recently, I discovered an incredibly refreshing/affirming essay wrapped in a hand-build web experience called “<a href="https://neustadt.fr/essays/the-small-web/">Rediscovering the Small Web</a>” by designer <a href="https://twitter.com/parimalsatyal">Parimal Satyal</a>, arguing for a different variety of Web presence:</p>

<blockquote><p>Modern web design principles are very rarely directed at regular people looking to make a website on something they are interested in. Instead, the focus is on creating websites that perform well:
<em>Don&#39;t use too many colours. Write short, catchy headlines. Don&#39;t let content be too long. Optimise for SEO. Produce video content, attention span is decreasing. Have a an obvious call to action. Push your newsletter. Keep important information above the fold. Don&#39;t make users think. Follow conventions.</em></p></blockquote>

<p>I realize that the majority of Web utilization cannot “revert” to hand-coded plain HTML web pages hosted on Neocities, but there&#39;s something to be learned (or remembered, in my case) from Satyal&#39;s argument: <strong>The Web&#39;s forgotten strength is <u>diversity</u></strong> (much like my country&#39;s, it would seem,) and the majority of users are being pushed by Google&#39;s search engine toward a very specific minority of URLs. We have not been <em>exploring</em> for a very long time:</p>

<blockquote><p>Instead of browsing, the web is for many an endless and often overwhelming stream of content and commentary picked out by algorithms based on what they think you already like and will engage with. It&#39;s the opposite of exploration.</p></blockquote>

<p>“It is worth remembering a website does not have to be a product; it can also be art,” argues Satyal. “The web is also a creative and cultural space that <strong>need not confine itself to the conventions defined by commercial product design and marketing</strong>.” (Emphasis mine.) It&#39;s not just that The Web was <em>meant</em> to be more – nostalgia is definitely not my particular trip, if you didn&#39;t know – it&#39;s that it <em>can</em> be so much more. My <a href="../../open.html">list of favorite Open Web projects</a> contains just a few examples of what I mean.</p>

<p>It&#39;s possible I am being <em>too</em> critical of Google. A <a href="https://twitter.com/search?f=live&q=%22https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2020%2F5%2F28%2F21272543%2Fgoogle-search-results-page-experience-load-time-contentfu-paint-layout-shift-top-stories-amp%22">Twitter search</a> for the link to <em>The Verge</em>&#39;s article reveals commentary like “<a href="https://twitter.com/carlosriverao/status/1266051773472608257">Experience, matters ;)</a>,” “<a href="https://twitter.com/markupgrade/status/1266492831218139137">Web search moving forward</a>,” and “<a href="https://twitter.com/reDDakteur/status/1266078587767177219">Halleluja!</a>,” so there are clearly users who are more than onboard, and not all of what Google has done for the web recently has been detrimental. It was also announced last month that <a href="https://blog.chromium.org/2020/05/resource-heavy-ads-in-chrome.html">Chrome will begin blocking “resource-heavy” advertisements</a> by default and that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/28/21273934/microsoft-google-chrome-edge-chromium-spellcheck-improvements">Google and Microsoft have been working together to improve spellcheck and scrolling in Chromium</a>. There&#39;s not much to feel about these announcements, but – as always – there is a whole lot to feel about Google as a company.</p>

<p>Google has <a href="https://dev.to/chromiumdev/announcing-web-dev-live-a-three-day-digital-event-2640">announced</a> a three-day live digital event at the end of this month (June 30th-July 2nd) in which viewers will “celebrate our community&#39;s actions, learn modern web techniques and connect with each other.” “Over three days, we&#39;ll share quick tips on aspects of modern web development,” explains the company on its <a href="https://web.dev/live/">web.dev/live page</a>. I am planning to attend and bitch as much as I am allowed. <a href="../../subscribe.html">Stay tuned</a> to hear a chronicle.</p>

<h2 id="the-ancient-ip-s-mmo-is-still-online-albeit-with-some-disappointing-discontinuations">The ancient IP’s MMO is still Online, albeit with some disappointing discontinuations.</h2>

<p>I entertained fantasies about a <em>Star Trek</em> MMO since first experiencing the genre through <em>Eve Online</em> and <em>World of Warcraft</em> in early adolescence. The idea of commanding my own starship in a universe of other “captains” alongside a hand-picked bridge crew was a beguiling one to myself and many others. This year, the game celebrated its <a href="https://trekmovie.com/2020/01/29/star-trek-online-legacy-celebrate-10-years-of-sto-with-jeri-ryan-and-sonequa-martin-green/">ten-year anniversary</a> (aligning well with the <a href="../../about.html">continued involuntary beat</a> of this blog.) I’m currently in the midst of my annual check-in with STO and thought an exploration of this most-consequential video game of my life’s history would be an appropriate undertaking.</p>

<p>The execution of today’s final, Arc Games-owned and maintained product is a particularly long and interesting one. As <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2014-11-22-the-game-archaeologist-perpetuals-star-trek-online.html">Justin Olivetti chronicled for <em>Engadget</em></a>, the license for <em>Star Trek Online</em> was originally <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/perpetual-entertainment-to-develop-and-publish-star-trek-massively-multiplayer-online-game">bought</a> and developed on by Perpetual Entertainment, which was assaulted by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150127173934/http:/massively.joystiq.com/2007/12/12/perpetual-plot-thickens-lawsuit-filed">a lawsuit</a> and extensive layoffs in December, 2006. The company was sued by Kohnke Communications for allegedly selling “valuable assets like the Star Trek Online license” to an affiliated entity called P2 entertainment. Clever. A quote from the complaint as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150128203353/http:/www.tentonhammer.com/node/15616">reported by <em>Ten Ton Hammer</em></a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>“On information and belief, the assets transferred to P2 include Perpetual Entertainment trademarks and copyrights, the perpetual.com domain name, and assets related to Star Trek Online, including code and the license… Perpetual received less than market value for the assets it transferred to P2, and the transfer made Perpetual insolvent (or worsened Perpetual&#39;s existing insolvency).”</p></blockquote>

<p><a href="https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Star_Trek_Online_(Perpetual_Entertainment)">Perpertual’s STO</a> was significantly different from today’s MMO. Instead of captaining one’s own starship, “players would have taken on the role of an officer who would be part of a crew of a starship,” echoing old legacy titles like <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2002/02/22/star-trek-bridge-commander-review"><em>Star Trek: Bridge Commander</em></a>.</p>

<blockquote><p>The proposed solution was that players could own smaller ships like fighters and minor spaceships, but the big ones — like the Galaxy class — would instead be adventure hubs with explorable, detailed interiors.</p></blockquote>

<p><img src="https://i.snap.as/dswfpYb.jpg" alt="Perpetual Entertainment&#39;s Star Trek Online"/></p>

<p>I was 14 in 2008 when I joined the original post-Perpetual Entertainment STO IRC channel when the game&#39;s license was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150203103236/http:/massively.joystiq.com/2008/01/14/star-trek-online-is-under-new-management/">first transferred</a> to Cryptic Studios. In fact, this channel was the only reason I left IRC clients open on my computers for years. It was exciting to find a community of people who were looking forward to participating in a <em>Star Trek</em> MMO as much as I was. I originally went by the (very cringey) username “crazyhooligin,” under which my current STO account is <a href="https://ufplanets.com/member.php?13827-DavidBlue=">still registered</a>. In the IRC channel, I met Sata – host of the now-defunct <a href="https://eileenlong-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/g/personal/david_eileenlonglcsw_com/EV9rOQgmdINNpSWg2t_vXLwBMEMHCkqPUHOsoEX58AdkAg">MMO Junkies podcast</a> and ex-Perpetual developer. He and the STORadio crew accepted me into their Teamspeak conversations despite how strange and unsocialized I was. I learned how <a href="https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Star_Trek_Online_(Perpetual_Entertainment)">extensive</a> and <a href="https://johneaves.wordpress.com/2009/06/25/more-vulcans-from-the-perpetual-files/">beautiful</a> their development had been. One wonders what Cryptic did with the original game and art assets and who technically owns them now.</p>

<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Fhed2yKVYwY" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>After <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150203103236/http:/massively.joystiq.com/2008/01/14/star-trek-online-is-under-new-management/">acquiring the rights</a> to make the game in early-2008, Cryptic was legally compelled to come up with a completed product in two years’ time as then-Executive Producer <a href="https://sto.gamepedia.com/Stephen_D'Angelo">Stephen D’Angelo</a> explained on the <a href="https://youtu.be/a0tP0YrlJB0">100th episode of the <em>STOked</em> podcast</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>We were under a very massive deadline to deliver the game. We had acquired the license from Perpetual and Perpetual’s license had an expiration date on it, and we had to ship the game before the expiration date or we would lose the license.</p></blockquote>

<p><em>STOked</em> also provided an excellent historical account of the acquisition entitled “<a href="https://youtu.be/Fhed2yKVYwY">How Cryptic Saved Star Trek Online</a>.” By late-Fall, 2009, <em>Star Trek Online</em> <a href="https://trekmovie.com/2009/10/22/star-trek-online-begins-closed-beta-trekmovie-giving-away-keys/">entered Closed Beta</a>, which I somehow acquired a key for in the name of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100521081251/http:/www.stoholic.com/">STOHolic.com</a> (a blogger site which represents one of my first web projects ever.) I was dual-booting Windows 7 Beta on my 2008 MacBook, which only supported 2 of its 4GB of RAM. The resulting performance was not optimal, but I was tremendously excited just to participate. Somewhere, there are at least three 480p handicam videos of Closed and Open Beta gameplay taken from over my shoulder, but I could not find them at the time of this writing. Comparatively, beta looked drastically different from the property that’s online today. In <a href="https://youtu.be/vH73ATZ96-w">this video of the original entry tutorial</a>, we are introduced to the game’s basic controls by the voice of Zachary Quinto of J.J. Abrams fame as the new Emergency Medical Hologram in godawful dropshadowed text. The lighting is dated, the blue-based user interface even more so.</p>

<p><img src="https://i.snap.as/t0aZwfB.jpg" alt="Star Trek Online Closed Beta"/></p>

<p>The hair was bad and the textures of the armor, worse. So was mine, though. I uploaded two videos under my STOholic name: an <a href="https://youtu.be/pqGll-DZp6s">unboxing of the Collector’s Edition</a> and what appears to be <a href="https://youtu.be/ghUJm9YWiVc">the definitive YouTube tutorial</a> to run <em>Star Trek Online</em> on Mac OSX using the (now defunct) wineskin wrapper. Though I was sixteen years old, I appear to be about eight. Endless waves of ground enemies, pressing the “1” key hundreds of thousands of times to whittle them away with my phaser rifle. There were bugs on top of bugs. My favorite was a swap between one&#39;s ground and space avatars: a gigantic captain would appear in space and a little ship would appear on the ground.</p>

<p>Four years ago, Lead Developer Al Rivera wrote “<a href="https://www.arcgames.com/en/games/star-trek-online/news/detail/10095363-history-of-star-trek-online-%E2%80%93-a-retrospective">History of Star Trek Online – a Retrospective</a>” – a blog post detailing the chronology of the game from its February 2nd, 2010 release date – about a week after my 16th birthday, for which my mom bought me my first and only gaming PC. I have never been very good at video games, and <em>Star Trek Online</em> has been no exception. After 10 years, my main Captain – Ambassador Kuvak – is still not doing adequate DPS to hold my own in <a href="https://sto.gamepedia.com/Task_Force_Operation">Task Force Operations</a>, from what I understand. My 15-16-year-old self chose a Science Captain but wanted to fly the great (engineering/tank-focused) cruisers of <em>The Original Series</em>, <em>The Next Generation</em>, and the latter&#39;s movies. This is possible, but not necessarily advised. Generally, one specs an Engineering Captain to tank, a Tactical Captain for DPS, and a Science Captain for “<a href="https://youtu.be/v5by0pRMNx8">exotic DPS</a>” and light healing. I managed to level a single science character – the original – through to the max ranks using little intelligence and a lot of persistence. Later in life, I’ve learned the patience for a more deliberate approach, but still struggle to make the numbers.</p>

<h2 id="the-exploration-system">The Exploration System</h2>

<p>For many <em>Star Trek</em> fans, <em>Star Trek Online</em>’s combat feels excessive. Or at least, that’s what you’d think. The current reality is that search engine results for “<a href="https://www.google.com/search?ei=b_nEXvrvNZCstQbVuqu4Aw&gs_lcp=CgZwc3ktYWIQAzoECCMQJzoFCAAQgwE6AggAOgYIABAWEB46CAghEBYQHRAeOgQIIRAKOgUIIRCgAToHCCEQChCgAVDFAlidHmDbH2gAcAB4AIABcYgBhhSSAQQzMS4xmAEAoAEBqgEHZ3dzLXdpeg&oq=star+trek+online+too+much+combat&q=star+trek+online+too+much+combat&sclient=psy-ab&source=hp&sxsrf=ALeKk02Vz7pYJlsD1Vn0gDTEJIsbJM6m6g%3A1589967215922&uact=5&ved=0ahUKEwi64-24kcLpAhUQVs0KHVXdCjcQ4dUDCAk">too much combat in STO</a>” are virtually nill. There are some comments on <a href="https://massivelyop.com/2015/03/05/star-trek-online-installs-memorials-for-leonard-nimoy-and-all-those-lost/"><em>Massively Overpowered</em> posts</a>, a <a href="http://www.containsmoderateperil.com/blog/2019/2/27/star-trek-online-non-combat-missions">year-old blog post in <em>Contains Moderate Peril</em></a> by Roger Edwards, an old <a href="https://ideonexus.com/2010/01/25/star-trek-online-explore-strange-new-worlds-seek-out-new-life-and-new-civilizations-and-kill-them-looking-for-science-in-star-trek-online-beta/">Ryan Somna take</a>, and… that’s about it. There was a definite (and entirely reasonable) argument against the amount of combat across the community early in the game’s development, but it looks like the arguers have simmered down and/or given up. This is also reasonable, considering its now ten-year lifespan. The only trouble is that non-combat options in <em>Star Trek Online</em> have actually diminished over the years.</p>

<p><img src="https://i.snap.as/BicLSE5.jpg" alt="Star Trek Online Romulan Borg"/></p>

<p>The original <a href="https://sto.gamepedia.com/Exploration_Cluster">Exploration System</a> was an ingenious and significant idea that “<a href="https://www.arcgames.com/en/games/star-trek-online/news/detail/6002963-exploration-cluster-removal">used automated tools to facilitate large quantities of widely varied content</a>.” Unfortunately, the result was “nothing close to what [Cryptic] originally planned.” Instead of inspiring variety, Exploration Clusters ended up becoming the most repetitive activity in the game – nothing more than a good source of crafting materials. The missions were generic and the environments simply randomly combined segments of the same interior textures. Procedurally generated environments would hit the mainstream conversation years later with <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2016/8/12/12461520/no-mans-sky-review-ps4-playstation-4-pc-windows-hello-games-sony"><em>No Man’s Sky</em></a>, which was written about in two fascinating articles by Raffi Khatchadourian in <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/18/world-without-end-raffi-khatchadourian"><em>The New Yorker</em></a> and Chris Baker in <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-news/no-mans-sky-how-games-are-building-themselves-104779/"><em>Rolling Stone</em></a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>Using procedural generation isn’t simply about offloading the creative process onto an algorithm – the real challenge is that it requires developers to teach an algorithm the difference between good and bad game design.</p></blockquote>

<p>Perhaps if <em>Star Trek Online</em>’s initial development window had not been so limited, Cryptic would’ve had time and resources to pioneer something truly <em>Trek</em> and extraordinary in the exploration system, but it ended up having to kill the idea altogether – no amount of <a href="https://www.change.org/p/cryptic-bring-exploration-to-star-trek-online-and-sto-back-to-the-true-roots-of-star-trek">Change.org petitions</a> could prevent this.</p>

<h2 id="the-foundry">The Foundry</h2>

<p>Perhaps <em>the</em> most innovative feature <em>Star Trek Online</em> contributed to gaming as a whole came to the live server in Spring, 2011. It was called <a href="https://sto.gamepedia.com/The_Foundry">The Foundry</a>, and it allowed players access to a diluted form of the same mission creation tools Cryptic themselves used to create content, enabling the community to publish its own playable stories. The result was a wonder virtually inexpressible in words. In player-made Foundry Missions, I found joy, wonder, sorrow, and insight – truly everything and more than one could ever want from fiction. Throughout 2013-2014 my girlfriend at the time and I ran regular <a href="https://sto.gamepedia.com/Foundry:List_of_missions">Foundry missions</a> together along with couple friends in our fleet. Unfortunately, I cannot remember a single specific mission (aside from <a href="https://youtu.be/zrXTZfHk4HQ"><em>Unholy Alliances</em></a>, I think,) but I remember the storytelling. I remember laughing at, dwelling on, and even crying for the characters we were introduced to. There were farming-oriented missions and some fairly rough drafts, sure, but the vast majority of the content was deliberately and delicately considered, especially the <a href="https://www.arcgames.com/en/games/star-trek-online/news/detail/3027483">Foundry Spotlight</a> series, which highlighted player-created stories of a particular quality and intrigue.</p>

<p><img src="https://i.snap.as/CGCgrAb.jpg" alt="Ambassador Class"/></p>

<p>Last April, however, <a href="https://www.arcgames.com/en/games/star-trek-online/news/detail/11102923">Arc retired the Foundry forever</a> – perhaps the worst possible news – stating “the legacy knowledge required to maintain the Foundry at our quality standards is no longer available,” meaning – as <a href="http://www.containsmoderateperil.com/blog/2019/3/4/cryptic-to-close-the-foundry">Rodger Edwards notes</a> – that all developers with their hands, hearts, and heads in the project had long since departed the company. The community reaction was heartbreaking. On Reddit, a group of mission authors and devotees <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/sto/comments/ayobu4/one_mans_quest_to_save_the_foundry/">committed to capturing</a> as many Foundry Missions as possible on video in the month between the announcement and date of death. User <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/waimser/">waimser</a> lamented the loss of the Foundry as a critical hit to <em>Star Trek Online</em>’s endgame:</p>

<blockquote><p>Once you&#39;ve played through the story missions and built your ship, the foundry is what&#39;s left, and it has some damn good stuff.</p></blockquote>

<p>The group even created a Google Docs spreadsheet to coordinate the effort. Another created <a href="https://www.arcgames.com/en/forums/startrekonline#/discussion/1247628/keeping-up-with-the-foundry-after-the-foundry-general-psa-preserved-content">a thread in the <em>Star Trek Online</em> forums</a> dedicated to “aggregating the various channels with Foundry content and providing those links to you and updating them as necessary.” In <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2020-02-11-how-star-trek-online-managed-to-live-long-and-prosper">an interview for <em>Gamesindustry.biz</em></a>, Al Rivera suggested that the secret to the title’s longevity in which his team had been “strategically successful” was knowing when and when not to make drastic changes. “Don&#39;t change the fundamentals of what players love about your game,” he suggested.</p>

<p><img src="https://i.snap.as/Vuz4d3N.jpg" alt="UFP Fleet Roster"/></p>

<h2 id="community">Community</h2>

<p>Though <em>STOked</em> and <em>STORadio</em> have long since been off the air, the Roddenberry Podcast Network’s <em>PriorityOne</em> is still going strong, having just recorded <a href="https://priorityonepodcast.com/460-rebranding-kirk-casting-groupees-priority-one-a-roddenberry-star-trek-podcast/">its 460th episode</a>. As I discovered last year, the game’s Twitch community is also thriving. <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/layriena">Layiena</a>’s streams are incredible because – while he understands theory as well as the other broadcasters in the STO Twitch community – it’s his incredible skills at live Captain commentary (calling out abilities and other command inputs as if he really is in the captain’s chair.) It may sound cringey (and perhaps it would be to many,) but his thoroughness and accuracy actually 1) make it seem pretty darn cool to me and 2) are hugely valuable in helping the viewer understand what he’s doing. After some three years, I know my one rotation fairly well, but only three or four of its steps by name – not even remotely well enough to do what he does. Unfortunately, it appears as though he’s been inactive since last year.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.twitch.tv/sphynx_sto">Sphynx</a>’s streams also have an especially professional feel – he is excellent at calling out his actions as well, if perhaps without so much intensity. His Norwegian sensibility is wonderful: when I introduced myself as being around in the community since 2008, he remarked “that’s strange considering the game has only been out since 2010.” Nigh-universally common threads among them: imperturbable kindness to their audience and an impressively wholesome commitment to <em>actually having fun</em>. Though I’m far from deeply saturated with Twitch culture as a whole, I’ve watched my fair share of <em>Eve Online</em>, <em>World of Warships</em>, and <em>Gran Turismo Sport</em> streams, and – while all of these have incredible communities – there’s none quite like the sincerity of the <em>Star Trek</em> fraternity.</p>

<p>A few weeks ago, I departed my own derelict STO fleet for the aptly-named <a href="https://ufplanets.com/">United Federation of Planets</a> which has over three thousand (presumably at least semi-active) members in its <a href="https://www.arcgames.com/en/games/star-trek-online/news/detail/9436793">fleet armada</a>. The fleet website has <a href="https://ufplanets.com/member.php?13827-DavidBlue=">user profiles</a>, a <a href="https://ufplanets.com/forum.php">very active forum</a>, and a <a href="https://discord.gg/M6UKBVj">Discord server</a> – everything I could possibly ask for. So far, I have been welcomed with <a href="https://ufplanets.com/showthread.php?78194-Application-DavidBlue=">overwhelming positivity</a>, and I’m grateful. In a prompt posted on both <a href="https://ufplanets.com/showthread.php?78339-Your-Favorite-Part-of-the-Community=">their forums</a> and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/sto/comments/gpyxcm/your_favorite_part_of_the_community/">Reddit</a>, I asked players what their favorite part of the community is. Oddly enough, some of the responses I got from the latter were quite jaded: “I really enjoy the love and respect the PVP community gets. No, wait...” <a href="https://medium.com/swlh/star-trek-online-ten-years-old-still-fun-eacd72b1380">Alex Rowe for <em>The Startup</em></a>:</p>

<blockquote><p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/sto/">The game’s subreddit</a> is full of folks who are tired of the game because they’ve blasted through all the content, but as someone who has only seen about 1/6th of the quests currently in the game, I’m eager to check out more.</p></blockquote>

<h2 id="state-of-the-game">State of The Game</h2>

<p>This past January, <em>Star Trek Online: Legacy</em> was <a href="https://www.arcgames.com/en/games/star-trek-online/news/detail/11357563-star-trek%3A-legacy-now-live!">launched</a>, bringing <em>The Original Series</em>-referencing episodes <em>The Measure of Morality</em> parts <a href="https://sto.gamepedia.com/Mission:_The_Measure_of_Morality_(Part_1)"><em>I</em></a> and <a href="https://sto.gamepedia.com/Mission:_The_Measure_of_Morality_(Part_2)"><em>II</em></a> along with a new <a href="https://sto.gamepedia.com/10_Year_Anniversary_Event">10 year anniversary event</a> and the <a href="https://www.arcgames.com/en/games/star-trek-online/news/detail/11351133-command-the-first-klingon%2Ffederation-ship!">Tier 6 Khitomer Alliance Battlecruiser</a> – “the first Klingon/Federation Starship.” I did not participate in the event, save for experiencing the new missions, which I talked about in <a href="../../star-trek-discovery-review.html">my review of <em>Star Trek: Discovery</em></a>. JustGaming4Us produced an excellent, <a href="https://youtu.be/KHhakbz6q8s">in-depth video review</a> of the two missions as well as a <a href="https://youtu.be/M3KJkcCaymA">tour of the event as a whole</a>. I, for one, have never been partial to Shiny New Ship gluttony largely because of how long it took me to “master” my own Intrepid-Class Retrofit – christened the U.S.S. <em>Bataan</em> after the aircraft carrier my grandfather served on in WWII – as much as I have. It took me years to arrange my bridge officer abilities and their keybinds in such a way that I could maintain a fairly-steady dps rotation and I have no desire to go through the process of learning a new ship again. For most veteran players, however, trying out different ships/skill specs is all there is left to do.</p>

<p>Choosing whether or not – or to whom – to recommend the game is an issue best left to actual gaming journalists. In March, <em>Massively Overpowered</em> – the followup project to what was once <em>Massively.com</em> – published <a href="https://massivelyop.com/2020/03/30/mmo-cartographer-boldly-going-into-star-trek-online/">Mia DeSanzo’s account</a> of her first experience in the game:</p>

<blockquote><p>Everything you’ve heard is true. Ground combat is, as multiple sources have told me, “a hot mess.” I don’t think clunky is an adequate descriptor. You’d have to try it.</p></blockquote>

<p>For the same site, <a href="https://massivelyop.com/2020/01/23/why-i-play-is-star-trek-online-worth-playing-in-2020/">Tyler F.M. Edwards argued</a> in January that <em>Star Trek Online</em> is best left to those who already love <em>Star Trek</em>:</p>

<blockquote><p>STO has some things going for it as a video game, and it’s certainly unique in the MMO space, but it has too many basis quality issues for it to be a game I’d recommend to someone who’s never watched an episode of Star Trek.</p></blockquote>

<p>Compared to what I experienced all those years ago in Closed and Open Beta, <em>Star Trek Online</em> is now <em>vastly</em> more polished, but perhaps compared to other MMOs in 2020, it is, indeed, “rough.” In my casual return this past month, I have yet to experience any significant bugs. Considering his character data dates back to launch, I’d like to think that the server is set into some brief, confused panic every time I log in to Kuvak, but perhaps that’s just a fantasy. I have still been enjoying the space combat in the classic Advanced-level <a href="https://www.arcgames.com/en/games/star-trek-online/news/detail/7003293-borg-disconnected">Borg Disconnected</a> and <a href="https://www.arcgames.com/en/games/star-trek-online/news/detail/9527023-star-trek-online%3A-counterpoint">Counterpoint</a> TFOs and my first entry into high-level gear upgrade crafting from the vast cache of materials I’ve built up over the years. . Apparently, my old lockbox collection might actually be worth some significant Energy Credits on the Exchange – as of the time of this writing, however, not a one had yet to sell.</p>

<p>If you’re a ship junkie who’s entirely unfamiliar with the property, know that <em>Star Trek</em>’s ships are <em>fucking cute</em>. The <a href="https://www.startrek.com/article/inside-the-nebula-class-starship">Nebula Class</a>, especially, inspires real affection. In my opinion, it alone is worth giving this free-to-play game a shot. My two point eight pound <a href="https://extratone.com/microsoft-surface-laptop-2-review-windows-future">Surface Laptop 2</a> is enough to run it fairly well at medium-high settings, which is an absurdly low barrier-to-entry. You shouldn’t be worried about investing your time, either – <em>Star Trek</em> doesn’t appear to be dying anytime soon.</p>

<h2 id="why-extratone-has-used-discord-instead-of-slack-for-our-team-chat">Why Extratone has used Discord instead of Slack for our team chat.</h2>

<p>Back in 2015, I hosted a pre-<em>Extratone</em> culture podcast called <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2zjkrB28csR68YoY1M1eSk"><em>Drycast</em></a> with musician friends from all over the net. To record remotely, we originally used Teamspeak 3 – a gamer VoIP staple. When I discovered Discord, I thought we&#39;d found podcasting heaven. Originally, the free plan included 128kbps audio in its voice channels, which was nearly twice what we were getting out of our <em>paid</em> Teamspeak server. If I were still podcasting, Discord&#39;s <a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360041721052-Server-Video">just-released server video feature</a> would undoubtedly prove invaluable for live streams.</p>

<p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">are you thankful for Discord?</p>&mdash; ※ David Blue ※ (@NeoYokel) <a href="https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/1261334179352100865?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 15, 2020</a></blockquote>
<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>According to <a href="https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/1261334179352100865?s=20">a poll I ran on Twitter</a>, 2/3rds of all people on Earth are thankful for Discord&#39;s existence. This is not surprising considering what every Discord user is still offered without spending any money at all: community spaces with audio/video and text chat capability, organizable by Twitch and YouTube-integrated roles with a plethora of different permission options, instantly and easily shareable by customizable temporary or permanent invite links through an application that&#39;s about as cross-platform as one can get (Windows, Mac, Linux, Android, iOS, or simply one&#39;s web browser.) Those of us that remember <a href="https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/1244758973867229185">IRC</a>, Ventrilo, and Teamspeak should all consider Discord a tremendous gift.</p>

<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NNJ2n6XKmmA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>Never before have so many VoIP, video, and text chat features been offered together, or in such a beautiful package. “What we really did was create an all-in-one voice, video, and text chat app that replaced this constellation of tools that people would use,” said CEO Jason Citron in <a href="https://youtu.be/NNJ2n6XKmmA">an interview with CNBC</a>. Technically in terms of these details, Discord <em>has no competition</em>. Slack offers text and voice chat with its paid plans, yes, but nothing close in terms of video – especially considering <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/8/9/20798559/discord-go-live-private-stream-voice-channel">Discord Go Live</a>, its fairly-new streaming feature, which allows users to stream game video directly to 10 other users in the server. With some jury-rigging, it&#39;s possible to simply screen share this way, which is an essential sell for business video communication applications like Skype.</p>

<p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Does anyone else have a discord server where you&#39;re the only member and you use different text channels to plan your weekly schedules lmaoooo</p>&mdash; Jab got 2 Jabs (@jab50yen) <a href="https://twitter.com/jab50yen/status/1270886743395520512?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 11, 2020</a></blockquote>
<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>“Discord and Slack have many similarities, but Discord is the superior tool,” says <a href="https://medium.com/ardentunited/why-we-use-discord-and-not-slack-500ac8027824">esports team Ardent United</a>. “Discord has voice channels, which allows us to easily chat with our supporters and other team members. Discord also allows us to set user roles and permissions which makes moderation extremely simple.” It&#39;s not just gaming companies, though. Decentralized cloud platform Sia also <a href="https://blog.sia.tech/sia-is-moving-from-slack-to-discord-195f87feb6a6">moved their community</a> to Discord:</p>

<blockquote><p>Its intended audience is gamers, but many large communities have switched from Slack to Discord, including development communities like <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react/blog/2015/10/19/reactiflux-is-moving-to-discord.html">Reactiflux</a> and <a href="https://medium.com/@polymoon/unreal-slackers-is-moving-to-discord-c93492eb0612">Unreal Slackers</a>. It includes an unlimited number of users, unlimited file uploads (with a per-file size limit), unlimited message histories, and really great moderation and spam filtering features.</p></blockquote>

<p>Slack is <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/reviews/slack">often praised</a> for its integrations, but it shares support with <a href="https://zapier.com/blog/slack-vs-discord/">Zapier</a> – a dedicated web integration service which more or less integrates them equally.</p>

<blockquote><p>Slack works with <a href="https://slack.com/integrations">a long list of tools</a>, including Google Calendar, Zendesk, Salesforce, Wunderlist, and dozens of others. If you&#39;re looking for an integration that isn&#39;t immediately obvious, you can always turn to Zapier for help, because Slack is a supported service. Zapier is an online service that creates integrations between other apps and services, without you having to know any code to make it happen.</p></blockquote>

<p>For sharing detailed post embeds, there&#39;s also <a href="https://discohook.org/">Discohook</a>, which I just discovered. Productivity company Chanty&#39;s blog wrote perhaps <a href="https://www.chanty.com/blog/discord-vs-slack">the most in-depth comparison</a> of the two services (emphasis theirs):</p>

<blockquote><p>At their core, Discord and Slack and very similar. Both are <strong>team chat apps</strong> with a similar interface. Both apps have <strong>team communication organized</strong> in channels. The biggest difference between the two is their <strong>target audience</strong>, and of course, their <strong>specific features</strong>.</p></blockquote>

<p>Ultimately, one must decide how relevant the services&#39; respective target audiences are to productivity. For a not-for-profit media organization like <em>Extratone</em>, Discord&#39;s features-for-price ratio is simply too rich to pass up. If you&#39;d like, <a href="https://discord.gg/0b9KQUKP858b0iZF">stop by our server</a> or try out <a href="https://discord.new/Nx7gawD84mMx">our server template</a>.</p>

<h2 id="new-microsoft-office-features-the-powertoys-run-preview-and-a-test-of-edge-chromium">New Microsoft Office features, the PowerToys Run Preview, and a test of Edge Chromium.</h2>

<p>I have no idea why I signed up to attend Microsoft&#39;s virtual 2020 Build Conference, but I did. I thought I&#39;d add my <a href="https://anchor.fm/davidblue">End User</a> commentary to the mix. Sorry. My first event was called “Every developer is welcome, with Scott Hanselman and guests.” Hanselman is listed as a <a href="https://www.hanselman.com/">blogger</a> and <a href="http://hanselminutes.com">podcaster</a> living (of course) in Portland. I&#39;m not a “real” developer, but I know what Microsoft Teams is, and I recognized the event as a desktop screenshare of his calls with different Microsoft employees. There was a <a href="https://twitter.com/JuanKRuiz/status/1262789374128816128">child invasion</a> and a dropped phone. I also noticed the icon for the <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/meet-the-new-microsoft-edge-your-move-google/">“new” Microsoft Edge</a> browser in his taskbar and realized that I hadn&#39;t downloaded it yet. I remedied that for the conference&#39;s sake – I thought it only appropriate that I try to use as much Microsoft software as possible in this context. I also installed the new <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/19/21262060/microsoft-windows-10-launcher-powertoy-spotlight-alfred-download-build">PowerTools Run preview</a> which I mentioned in my <a href="../../poweruser-tips-software-shortcuts.html">tips post</a>.</p>

<p>Build allows an attendee to build one&#39;s own event schedule, but I neglected to find those focused on what I really care about: <strong>Office 365</strong>. As <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/19/21260005/microsoft-office-fluid-web-document-features-build">reported by <em>The Verge</em></a>, <a href="https://eileenlong-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/g/personal/david_eileenlonglcsw_com/EXd7qVaXqRlHlnnllT7_A5gBRw-ypXkANGTIWlzEPlLzQA?e=PrLfh6">Microsoft Fluid</a> is going to change a lot:</p>

<blockquote><p>Microsoft’s Fluid Framework sounds a lot like Google Docs, but it’s actually Google Docs on steroids. Microsoft is so confident it has built the future of productivity, it’s now open-sourcing its Fluid Framework so the rest of the world can help shape what it has created.</p></blockquote>

<p>There&#39;s also <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-lists-150002899.html">Microsoft Lists</a>, which is reportedly going to revolutionize SharePoint Lists into something more modern and useful:</p>

<blockquote><p>It builds off the <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/what-is-a-list-in-sharepoint-93262a88-20ad-4edc-8410-b6909b2f59a5">existing feature in SharePoint</a>, and will let you track progress and data to organize your teams, potentially making the company’s offerings more streamlined and productive.</p></blockquote>

<p><img src="https://i.snap.as/XmboQGr.png" alt="Microsoft PowerToys Run"/></p>

<h2 id="microsoft-edge-chromium">Microsoft Edge Chromium</h2>

<p>As an Office 365 administrator, I basically only use Edge for administrative/management tasks. Otherwise, I can&#39;t imagine a reason to use it over Firefox, Brave, Vivaldi, Chrome, Opera, etc, but I thought I&#39;d give the “new” (as of January) Edge a tryout for your sake and make it my default browser for a day as well as Microsoft&#39;s Bing search engine. There&#39;s also news specific to Build: <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/19/microsoft-edge-gets-a-pinterest-integration-sidebar-search-and-automatic-profile-switching/">Edge is integrating with Pinterest</a>, of all things:</p>

<blockquote><p>Now, Edge will feature a Pinterest-powered tool that will show suggestions from Pinterest at the bottom of a collection. Clicking on that, Microsoft says, will take users to a Pinterest board “of similar, trending Pins so users can quickly find and add ideas relevant to their collection.” Users will also be able to export collections to Pinterest.</p></blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m in no position to “test” a browser, but the new Edge is noticeably faster at rendering pages and much <em>much</em> smoother when navigating between tabs/preference windows. It looks much more like Chrome, which makes sense. Perhaps because my install is absent of third-party extensions, opening new tabs and windows was much faster than my other browsers. I recorded a <a href="https://vimeo.com/420430704">~2 minute demo</a> of normal browsing on <a href="https://extratone.com/microsoft-surface-laptop-2-review-windows-future">my Surface Laptop 2</a>.</p>

<iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/420430704" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>In terms of touch support, Edge remains the only acceptable browser on Windows 10. If you&#39;ve spent money on a new PC recently, chances are your device is touch-enabled. If you&#39;re like me, you&#39;ve already <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4028019/windows-enable-and-disable-your-touchscreen-in-windows-10">disabled it</a>. If not, you&#39;ll find scrolling and navigation in Edge have improved tremendously – it&#39;s like an entirely new browser <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/6/18527550/microsoft-chromium-edge-google-history-collaboration">because it is</a>.</p>

<blockquote><p>Because Edge used a different rendering engine than Chrome or Safari, it meant that it would sometimes have problems on websites. Testing a website against multiple browsers has always been difficult, and because Edge had so little uptake, it meant optimizing for it often fell off the priority list for web developers.</p></blockquote>

<p>I really like how easy it is to mute audio from tabs and how much better <a href="https://write.as">my CMS</a> is rendered. I still prefer Firefox&#39;s method of tab switching (by last-used chronologically instead of in the order presented.) The reader view is smoother than its competitors and offers a beautiful selection of themes as well as the best “Read aloud” feature in the business.</p>

<p><img src="https://i.snap.as/jWqG85f.png" alt="Microsoft Edge Reader View"/></p>

<p>I&#39;m not going to quote you measurements – check out <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3513973/microsofts-new-edge-browser-third-times-the-charm.html"><em>Computerworld</em>&#39;s browser review</a> for that – but I can say that Edge Chromium is using more RAM than Firefox but a bit less than Chrome. <a href="http://office.com">Office.com</a> also looks and works incredibly well. Overall, I&#39;m extremely impressed with Edge Chromium and the improvements to Bing. As of my experiences today, it&#39;s the fastest and smoothest web browser I have, which is a complete flip from that of the old Edge.</p>
