# [The Unlicense, Dave Edition](https://gist.github.com/extratone/140a11428b5dd1dda500b3928e0438b1)

Considering my use of Git as a means to track revisions on my own writing, it's important to note that you should feel free to replace all instances of "software" in the above statement with "words," "writing," "expression," etc.

While I appreciate tremendously the work and contribution of [Arlo Bendiken](https://ar.to/2010/01/set-your-code-free) in the form of The Unlicense, I would like to add that I see no need, personally, to make the refutation of Intellectual Property law regarding my own work into some profound ethical statement. As it stands, I have not to my knowledge been the victim of any sort of theft of any kind, and find the suggestion highly unlikely. If I *am*  made aware of such a case, there is certainly a possibility that I may change my mind on this issue, so I suppose I should highlight that **THESE TERMS ARE SUBJECT TO CHANGE**, though I suspect I would be more flattered and/or amused than actually offended. 

I would also like to annotate that my use of this license should not be regarded as a suggestion that anyone else follow my example, or that I "believe in" taking such action regarding one's work, generally. While I did indeed take the time to set up [a repository](https://github.com/extratone/eoi) of John Perry Barlow's "[The Economy of Ideas](https://www.wired.com/1994/03/economy-ideas/)" in a bunch of different document formats, I do not necessarily agree with all of what he argued, especially in the context of the world 27 years later. If you *are* particularly interested in my opinion on the matter for whatever reason, here is what I have to say to you:

The principled beginning of The Open Web was a great moment in history, but - like all historical principles - it is extremely important that we consider *context* and maintain an appropriate level of criticism when looking back on old manifestos written by old white guys. In general, try your best to *be reasonable*.

<h2 id="an-attempt-to-fix-a-windows-insider-build-issue-led-to-soft-bricking-my-surface-laptop-2">An attempt to fix a Windows Insider Build issue led to soft-bricking my Surface Laptop 2.</h2>

<p>I finally did it, ladies and gentlemen... I managed to break the Windows installation on my <a href="https://www.davidblue.wtf/t/surface/">Microsoft Surface Laptop 2</a> to such an extent that it has been unrecoverable. I am currently borrowing my mother&#39;s MacBook Pro and waiting on a Windows 10 installation .ISO file to download so that I can hope to mount it correctly on the last, shitty USB thumb drive I still have lying around.</p>

<p><img src="https://i.snap.as/GG9y4pmC.png" alt="Fuck Grammarly"/></p>

<p><em>YEAH, THAT&#39;S RIGHT BITCH.</em></p>

<p>I now suspect I began down this path a few months ago when I discovered <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2020/06/15/introducing-windows-insider-channels/">Windows Insider Channels</a> and rejoiced... As I&#39;ve discovered that one can relatively easily find a beta version of virtually <em>any</em> piece of software, it&#39;s become a bit of a habit for me. More or less unconsciously, I’ve ended up with an application library full of <em>Developer Beta</em> and <em>Nightly</em> <em>Build</em>-type shit. I don&#39;t think there was/is a single web browser installed on that machine that is not the given entity&#39;s “Developer Edition” which – considering most of the regular installs allow you to opt into dev tools, anyway – seem like they might be redundant. I don&#39;t particularly care, anymore – I mostly just love their icons. <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/developer/">Firefox Developer Edition</a>&#39;s logo is a blue Firefox(!,) <a href="https://www.microsoftedgeinsider.com/en-us/download">Edge Chromium Dev</a>&#39;s is... more interesting than the regular version. <a href="https://www.google.com/chrome/canary/">Google Chrome Canary</a>&#39;s icon is a surprisingly-tasteful variation of the company&#39;s usually-horrendous color palette.</p>

<p>What I&#39;m trying to say is... I have continued upon this habit of opting for unstable versions of software in a sort of defiance against the common sense notion that relying upon them is generally a <em>bad idea</em>.[^1] I suppose I was just <strong>waiting to experience any consequences</strong> from such a decision, and well... Here they are!</p>

<p>It all began when my Surface&#39;s integrated webcam became invisible to all applications that used a video input – including Microsoft&#39;s own Camera app and OBS. It showed up in Device Manger, where I did the generally-recommended troubleshooting task of uninstalling it completely (including its drivers) and rebooting to force Windows to reinstall it. It did so successfully every time, to no effect on the original issue. I also went into the Surface&#39;s BIOS menu, where its hardware devices are explicitly listed, and disabled/re-enabled the camera, to no effect. Normally, the absence of a webcam function would be more or less irrelevant to my day-to-day workflow, but now that <a href="https://www.davidblue.wtf/college-return/">I&#39;m partaking in “virtual” college courses</a>, at least one of my professors has pressured me to appear <em>on cam</em> as soon as possible.</p>

<p>On Sunday night, I decided to revisit the problem with greater commitment, diving into a variety of deeper troubleshooting steps which I do not recall. The crucial one, though, was my decision to use the System File Checker tool <code>(sfc /scannow)</code> with the added instruction to <em>fix</em> whatever errors it found.[^2] This drove my dearest little laptop into a cycle of self-diagnoses which results in an option screen including “Reset PC.” After trying virtually every other option, I decided to try resetting, only to be met with connectivity error messages after pursuing the “Install via Network” option, leaving the use of a bootable Windows 10 recovery USB as my only choice, in theory.</p>

<p>Another problem now arose: my mother&#39;s MacBook Pro is the only other machine I have any sort of access to at the moment, and MacOS no longer supports the creation of such a bootable USB for Windows via the Boot Camp Utility any longer. Nevertheless, I tried to make one by downloading the correct OS ISO and mounting it via UNetbootin, which didn&#39;t work. I then called <a href="https://www.colcomputers.com/">Columbia Computer Center</a>, who very generously agreed to make one for me and only charge me for the drive itself ($10!)</p>

<p>Unfortunately, that one hasn&#39;t worked either, so I&#39;m afraid I&#39;m just going to have to take the thing to them... <a href="https://www.davidblue.wtf/t/surface/">Stay tuned</a> for the Final Verdict.</p>

<p>[1] This is why I’ve always downloaded the developer iOS beta releases on my actual, daily driver handset.</p>

<p>[2] I’m pretty sure it was “-f” but I’m not going to do the research to verify that… Sorry!</p>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="book e-content"><p><img src="https://i.snap.as/2eB6JrY.png" alt="SoundCloud Tile"/></p>

<h2 id="i-ve-got-some-fucking-opinions-about-soundcloud">I’ve got some fucking opinions about SoundCloud…</h2>

<p>My friend Sierra has used SoundCloud almost exclusively for her music discovery, consumption, and recommendations, but has remained resolute in her unwillingness to financially invest in the service. As such, her listening is regularly interrupted by ads and limited to bitrates <a href="https://www.magneticmag.com/2018/01/soundcloud-lowers-sound-quality-uploads-half/">as low as 64kbps</a>. Since I was last employed, I have maintained a vow to her that I would pay for a subscription to SoundCloud Go+ – the premium <em>listener</em> tier of the service – with my own money, once I was once again in place at a steady job. This move would remove all advertising from her listening and <a href="https://help.soundcloud.com/hc/en-us/articles/360010227514-High-Quality-Streaming">up its bitrate to 256kbps</a>, among <a href="https://checkout.soundcloud.com/go">other benefits</a>.</p>

<p>Two nights ago, we were refueling her car in preparation for another one of our recreational drives into rural Missouri when I made the decision on a whim to simply signup for a trial of Go+ on <a href="https://soundcloud.com/chordoslut">my own account</a> using Apple Pay, mostly because I knew we’d be going out of effective cell network range and one of Go+’s most emphasized features is its ability to download music locally. (Since my Apple Music subscription expired earlier this year, I only have <a href="https://bigkrit.com/music/king-remembered-in-time/">a single album</a> actually downloaded on my phone.)</p>

<p><iframe allow="monetization" class="embedly-embed" src="https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fw.soundcloud.com%2Fplayer%2F%3Fvisual%3Dtrue%26url%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fapi.soundcloud.com%252Ftracks%252F255811428%26show_artwork%3Dtrue&amp;display_name=SoundCloud&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fsoundcloud.com%2Fkeithjarrettofficial%2Frio-part-v&amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fi1.sndcdn.com%2Fartworks-4o6X0NzCmNjZ-0-t500x500.jpg&amp;key=d932fa08bf1f47efbbe54cb3d746839f&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=soundcloud" width="500" height="500" scrolling="no" title="SoundCloud embed" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowfullscreen="true"></iframe></p>

<p>***
The above is what I wrote several weeks ago, just as I was beginning my trial period. Now, having experienced a significant amount of time as a SoundCloud Go user, I am a bit sad that my trial is over. To be honest, I fully intended to become a paying subscriber, but my PayPal account was $0.70 short of the $12.99 monthly fee when the first billing cycle came, two weeks ago. This is not a conclusion I expected to come to, as SoundCloud’s fundamental arrangement could not possibly differ any more from the music streaming service I long claimed as my ideal own: Apple Music.</p>

<p>One major worry I would imagine potential subscribers may have when approaching SoundCloud as a replacement for their single music subscription service would revolve around the extent of SoundCloud’s establishment music industry library. There’s no way your Dad’s Sunday barbecue playlist is going to be on <em>SoundCloud</em>, right? Strangely enough, I was unable to find a single track that <em>was not</em> in the library. From my own favorite <a href="https://soundcloud.com/keithjarrettofficial">Keith Jarrett’s archives</a> to <a href="https://soundcloud.com/dixiechicks/sets/gaslighter-2">the new Dixie Chicks album</a>, every bit of big time record label-distributed music I could conceieve of could be found aside the Go+ badge (though notably, neither of these showed significant playcounts.) As far as the app experience goes, I <em>swear</em> it got smoother as soon as I signed up for Go+. This is probably bullshit, but regardless, with the seemingly ever-widening disparity in the experiences of free vs. premium users, SoundCloud appears to be moving actively away from the former.</p>

<p><img src="https://i.snap.as/78HwnfKK.png" alt="SoundCloud Desktop Keyboard Shortcuts"/></p>

<p>I have long said (somewhat in jest) that <a href="https://soundcloud.com/chancetherapper">Chance The Rapper</a> is the only reason SoundCloud still exists.</p>

<blockquote><p>From a future historian’s perspective, the battle for the definitive name in independent digital music distribution has already won, largely thanks to its relationship with Chance The Rapper, who’s quickly become a “cultural influencer, thought leader, global star,” and one of my generation’s upmost celebrity champions. Obviously, there is little sense trying to determine whether SoundCloud <em>earned</em> his partnership or landed their popular association with his name as long as the artist maintains it publicly, while continuing to <a href="https://soundcloud.com/pitchfork/pitchfork-presents-in-sight-out-chance-the-rapper">give new meaning</a> to the phrase “serially likable.”

<p>If <em><a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/chance-the-rapper-soundcloud/">CNET_ was asking the question</a> a year before that Bandcamp essay, I think I can feel properly varified. What I’d really like to know, now: does Chance still feel the same way about the streaming service after the launch of SoundCloud Go+? Considering that I am far from a <em>real</em> music journalist, I do not have any more contact resources than you have. That said, I left [a comment on his Facebook Page](<a href="https://www.facebook.com/chancetherapper/posts/3299672310124810?comment=">https://www.facebook.com/chancetherapper/posts/3299672310124810?comment</a></em>id=3319045628187478). I guess we’ll see.</p>

<p>Some more technical bits: SoundCloud is now castable on Chromecast, but <em>not</em> supported by Apple CarPlay, for whatever that’s worth. Notably apart from Bandcamp and Apple Music and aligned with Spotify, SoundCloud is explicitly investing in algorithmic music discovery, which means its users are doing the curatorial work. <em>I</em> am doing/have done the curatorial work. That means the DnB crowd is going to receieve Toto recommendations, given what I sought out for this post. You’re welcome, and sorry…</p>
<ol><li>While I was surprisingly unable to find any Tweets or Evernotes further evangelizing Apple Music (I suspect I’m thinking of an old, untranscribed <em>Drycast</em> episode,) I found real magic in the service as I perceieved it: $9.99 a month for <em>all of iTunes</em>. 13 year-old me would considerthat one helluva deal.</li>
<li>Naturally, if you know of one, please do comment and/or <a href="https://www.davidblue.wtf/contact/">drop me a line</a>.</li>
<li>In fact, it is the only streaming app I found that _does not _have CarPlay support. Even Bandcamp and MixCloud for iOS do!</li></ol>

<h2 id="basecamp-s-hey-matters-and-not-just-because-it-took-on-apple-s-app-store-policies">Basecamp&#39;s HEY matters, and not just because it took on Apple&#39;s App Store policies.</h2>

<p>Something always worth celebrating: a considered, no-nonsense new effort to reimagine email. I&#39;ve lived through many notable milestones in this regard: <a href="https://youtu.be/vN4U5FqrOdQ?t=2321">Apple Mail</a> on the original iPhone, <a href="https://time.com/43263/gmail-10th-anniversary/">Gmail</a>, Readdle&#39;s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/5/29/8683775/spark-email-app-iphone-apple-watch">Spark</a>, and (yes, really,) the revitalization of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/4/17819636/microsoft-resdesigned-outlook-windows-web">Microsoft&#39;s Outlook</a>. Exciting innovations have abounded throughout email&#39;s history, but it&#39;s highly debatable whether or not any of them have really changed the way we use it in a profound way, yet I am unfailingly intrigued whenever somebody new comes along, so when I saw <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/15/21286466/hey-email-basecamp-price-availability-platforms-launch">Casey Newton&#39;s story</a> on <em>The Verge</em>&#39;s frontpage discussing Basecamp&#39;s <a href="https://hey.com/">HEY</a> before I got out of bed on the morning of June 15th, I was delighted to see an organization still had the courage to invest their confidence and resources into their Ideas About Email. Originally, <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20200510220647/https://hey.com/">HEY&#39;s homepage</a> included a prompt: “To get on the list, email iwant@hey.com and tell us how you feel about email. Could be a love story, or a hate story. Could be long, could be short. It’s your story, so it’s up to you.” Though I knew it&#39;d likely never be read, I decided to write them a letter about my personal history with email, which turned into an entertaining enough anecdote to publish here.</p>

<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UCeYTysLyGI" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>The real reason HEY continued to be so widely covered by tech media, though, was its challenge to Apple&#39;s App Store policies after one of its updates was <a href="https://www.protocol.com/hey-email-app-store-rejection">rejected by the marketplace</a> just a day after Casey&#39;s story was published. Much drama ensued – I have done my best to aggregate links to all the news stories on the subject in <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/extratown/comments/hbncn6/news_surrounding_hey_the_upcoming_email_service/">a thread</a> on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/extratown"><em>Extratone</em> subreddit</a> I recently started. I think <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/16/21293419/hey-apple-rejection-ios-app-store-dhh-gangsters-antitrust">the public resistance by Basecamp&#39;s CTO David Heinemeier Hansson</a> was probably a PR move, which is fine, but all I wanted to contribute was a review of the actual function of HEY, itself. After reading posts by some of my favorite bloggers, however, I think it would be redundant. Kev Quirk argued “<a href="https://kevq.uk/email-is-not-broken/">Email Is Not Broken</a>,” to which Mike Stone responded “<a href="https://mikestone.me/email-is-broken">Email Is Broken</a>.” Additionally, <em>Business Insider</em>&#39;s Lisa Eadicicco published an <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/hey-email-app-review-basecamp-inbox-2020-7">in-depth review</a> at the beginning of the month.</p>

<p>My singular commentary: I&#39;m worried that subscription services that exclusively accept large yearly sums like HEY inevitably become the “country club for the most self-important emailers in business” which Casey spoke of. I guess we&#39;ll see.</p>

<p><em>The following is an excerpt from <a href="http://simp.ly/p/lw0h0R">my letter to HEY</a> asking for a early-access invite.</em></p>

<h2 id="email-and-i-an-abridged-history">Email and I: An Abridged History</h2>

<p>I am 26 years old, so I suppose I&#39;m of the first generation that&#39;s never experienced life <em>without</em> email. I grew up on a farm in rural central Missouri and my dad was very much an early adopter. (You&#39;d be surprised how e-enabled farmers were becoming in the early 2000s.) I cannot remember life before the humongous satellite dish was anchored in our front yard. Long before I had any reason to be online (or really understood what that meant,) he began and ended every day sitting at in front of a CRT on a corner desk, clacking away on a cigarette smoke-yellowed plastic keyboard for hours. I did not understand why, then, but in retrospect I realize that he was corresponding with a huge network of neighbors, politicians, family, and college friends via email lists/chains and that he depended on it both professionally and personally in a big way. As a single man living at least an hour&#39;s drive from a city of any size, I suppose my dad was predisposed to have a rich online life long before his suburban peers, which normalized it precociously for me.</p>

<p>The summer before my first grade year, my elementary school became the first in the district to have a computer lab (also the first air-conditioned room in the building,) so my high school graduating class was literally the very first to have had any digital curriculum – and an email address(!) – for the entirety of our public school experience. Because of this, I think most of us were trained to think of email as a tool for school work – it was eluded to by our computer teachers that our school email addresses were being monitored to make sure they remained so (obviously, they weren&#39;t.) As we grew into 6th-7th grade, however, we all seemed to end up with personal email addresses. I consider myself lucky to have experienced a very brief window – before instant messaging/early social networks became mainstream and SMS became even remotely pleasant to use – when my middle school friends and I corresponded exclusively by email when we weren&#39;t on the phone.</p>

<p>It still sounds a bit silly to say, but I&#39;ve spent the past few years coming to believe more and more strongly that my first-generation iPhone changed my life forever in a profound way – <em>especially</em> my relationship with email. After watching <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/674796/how-to-archive-or-delete-a-facebook-group/">Steve Job&#39;s introduction at MacWorld 2007</a> live, I promised to skip a year of Christmas gifts if my mom would agreed to buy me one, and she did. Obviously, it was like nothing else I&#39;d ever experienced, and it completely changed how I responded to and thought about technology. Before smartphones, there was no checking email outside of time in the computer lab, which was intended to be quite strictly-regulated. I had a real advantage when I started bringing my iPhone to school – absolutely no one knew what it was (a bizarre thought in contrast,) including teachers. Suddenly able to browse and read my inbox in class, at lunch, and on the bus, my use and consideration of email was propelled far ahead of my peers&#39;.</p>

<p>When I started an online magazine in 2016, I don&#39;t think I could&#39;ve conceived of the extent to which running a modern media company – even one targeted toward tech-savvy, early-adopting youth – still involves email. I assumed that my audience rarely <em>actually read</em> from their inboxes and relied almost exclusively on social networks for content discovery, so I originally forwent any implementation of a newsletter. As I grew more and more interested in and engaged with the media beat, I was exposed to the email renaissance of the past 2-3 years thanks to services like Revue and Substack, saw that it was good, and decided to give it a try for myself. I launched our semi-regular newsletter in April, 2017 on the subjects of “<strong>Division</strong>, <strong>Art</strong>, and <strong>Media</strong>” and published a little over 30 issues over the course of 18 months. To be honest, I&#39;m not sure I&#39;ve ever had so much fun writing.</p>

<p>Very shortly after it began, I observed our general engagement quadruple, and – quite selfishly – found the process of aggregation to be soothing and very mentally restorative. It exposed some pretty horrendous media consumption habits of mine, but it also offered a painless solution to them. As soon as everything I read became a potential item in the newsletter, I wasn&#39;t just reading for myself anymore (or at least, that&#39;s the mentality it gave me,) so I could no longer afford to dismiss particular subjects as easily or to skim so recklessly. I nurtured a much less chaotic media diet and found myself absorbing <em>a lot</em> more of what I wanted to without wasting so much time burning through links. I ended up feeling more focused in other, unrelated areas of my life, too. Obviously, I love email for that, and I miss writing that darn newsletter so much that I continuously look for excuses to do something similar.</p>

<p>My former Tech Editor loved email perhaps as much, but she&#39;s definitely the only person I&#39;ve ever met who finds the medium as <em>entertaining</em> as I do. (If you&#39;re <em>really</em> committed, I just made a <a href="https://twitter.com/i/events/1272514574420500481?s=13">Twitter Moment</a> full of all the best stuff I&#39;ve ever posted about email – mostly jokes like “<a href="https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/921352650788130822">patron saint of email marketing</a>,” but there are one or two profound posts in there, too.) We realized one day that – aside from The Webbys – there are very few notable awards celebrating excellence in the email medium, so we decided our magazine would host the 2017 First Annual Email Awards. Unfortunately, I don&#39;t think anyone else had any idea what the heck we were trying to do, so we never received enough submissions. However, I noticed a great opening paragraph in the original announcement post which I thought made a worthy conclusion:</p>

<blockquote><p>Man has used electronic mail to intercommunicate, woo, build communities, topple businesses &amp; civilizations, embezzle money, spread worms, distribute cluttered, broken links to discontinued Orscheln products, feed infants, set climate control, confirm identities, check bank account statuses, and lie to exhausted, slightly-conceited, and <em>newly self-published</em> professors. That&#39;s right – These Trillions of simple digijewels have purveyed <em>every single possible category of human communication</em>, and it&#39;s still growing strong.</p></blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m excited to give Hey a try – I hope you&#39;ll consider inviting me early. I&#39;ll even send my feedback if you so desire it! If not, I&#39;ll probably end up trying a paid subscription, anyway hehe. Either way, let me wish the best of luck to your team. Win or lose, I&#39;m glad you&#39;re taking action on your complaints, unlike the rest of us.</p>

<p>Thank you!</p>

<p>Almost exactly two years ago, <a href="../../google-soul-ledger-dont-be-evil.html">I warned that Google was on track to replace God</a> of us all. Last month, <em>The Verge</em>&#39;s Dieter Bohn reported that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/28/21272543/google-search-results-page-experience-load-time-contentfu-paint-layout-shift-top-stories-amp">Google plans to begin accounting for “page experience” in its search rankings</a> beginning in 2021, later explaining in a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/21274502/vergecast-podcast-407-trump-executive-order-social-media-hbo-max-launch">subsequent episode of <em>The Vergecast</em></a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>Here is another example of the Chrome team coming up with a bunch of web standards and then the Search team making a bunch of incentives based on those standards.</p></blockquote>

<p>It was news to me that in May, Google <a href="https://blog.chromium.org/2020/05/introducing-web-vitals-essential-metrics.html">launched</a> a page called “Web Vitals” on its <a href="https://web.dev/vitals/"><strong>web.dev</strong></a> domain (which they&#39;ve <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20180415000000*/web.dev">apparently owned since November 2018</a>.) The company measures “page experience” based on three main criteria:</p>

<blockquote><ul><li><a href="https://web.dev/lcp/"><strong>Largest Contentful Paint</strong></a> measures perceived load speed and marks the point in the page load timeline when the page&#39;s main content has likely loaded.</li>
<li><a href="https://web.dev/fid/"><strong>First Input Delay</strong></a> measures responsiveness and quantifies the experience users feel when trying to first interact with the page.</li>
<li><a href="https://web.dev/cls/"><strong>Cumulative Layout Shift</strong></a> measures visual stability and quantifies the amount of unexpected layout shift of visible page content.</li></ul>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://www.costarastrology.com/neoyokel">CoStar</a> just sent an oddly topical (and honestly, encouraging) notification:</p>

<p><img src="https://i.snap.as/1Lo8JrN.jpeg" alt="Costar Notification"/></p>

<p>I&#39;m not a “real” web developer – nor do I mean to dictate to a single one – but I know enough theory to note that of this “core web” education operation centered around web.dev is operating on some irritating assumptions:</p>

<h3 id="1-smaller-assets-are-ideal">1. Smaller assets are ideal.</h3>

<p>The simple assumption that it is always better to have the smallest page possible – that images should be resized and compressed to hell and typography/other elements should be few in number. Instantaneous page loads should be priority over any other standards of measure for a web page – like interesting design, for instance.</p>

<h3 id="2-minimalistic-design-is-necessary">2. Minimalistic design is necessary.</h3>

<p>The reality – for most of the Western world, at least – is that <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/kevinmurnane/2018/12/11/heres-how-internet-speeds-fared-for-the-worlds-fastest-and-largest-countries-in-2018/#3f3124664976">average network speeds are exponentially increasing</a> year-by-year. In 2018:</p>

<blockquote><p>World-wide average mobile download speed was 22.82 Mbps (Megabits per second), an increase of 15.2% over 2017. Average upload speed was 9.19 Mbps, an increase of 11.6%. Fixed broadband speeds also increased. Average download speed increased 26.4% to 46.12 Mbps, while average upload speed came in at 22.44 Mbps, a 26.5% increase.</p></blockquote>

<p>I may be a yokel, but these averages are still absolutely <em>inconceivable</em> to me. Our phones have as much RAM as my “studio” work desktop, now. 22.82 Mbps will reliably download <em>very</em> complex web pages nearly instantaneously. There is a very reasonable argument for essential services like search engines and news websites to conform to/adopt standards like AMP, but for the rest of The Open Web, ingenuity and risktaking should be <em>encouraged</em>, not discouraged, for the true good of all Peoplekind.</p>

<p>A term I haven&#39;t seen for a good while describes this ideology: “the <strong>mobile web</strong>,” and it completely sucking ass is not a new concept. I&#39;ve before referenced <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/7/20/9002721/the-mobile-web-sucks">an old complaint</a> from 2015 by <em>The Verge</em>&#39;s Editor-in-Chief, Nilay Patel (which the original article also links in different context in its last line):</p>

<blockquote><p>The entire point of the web was to democratize and simplify publishing using standards that anyone could build on, and it has been a raging, massively disruptive success for decades now. But the iPhone&#39;s depressing combination of <a href="https://www.netmarketshare.com/browser-market-share.aspx?qpcustomd=1&qprid=0">dominant mobile web marketshare</a> and shitbox performance means we&#39;re all sort of ready to throw that progress away.</p></blockquote>

<h3 id="3-google-has-the-right-to-dictate-best-practices">3. Google has the right to dictate “Best Practices.”</h3>

<p>The Mobile Web as a utility has its place, but it&#39;s certainly not a necessary or desirable ideal for the entirety of The Web, yet Google has the audacity to presume it can dictate what is and is not optimal web design. The URL in and of itself is extremely presumptuous – Google technically has every right to own web.dev, sure, but <em>should</em> it? The Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMP) program has already had an annoying effect on day-to-day browsing. I despise AMP links more than most things in life, just as I despise the name of the website <em>Search Engine Land</em> (which sounds like actual hell) who <a href="https://searchengineland.com/the-google-page-experience-update-user-experience-to-become-a-google-ranking-factor-335252">also reported on this</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>If you have AMP, the good news is that the majority of AMP pages do extremely well in terms of page experience metrics, [Google Project Manager] Rudy Galfi said. It doesn’t mean that all AMP pages will have top page experience metrics, but AMP is built in a way to help with this.</p></blockquote>

<p>Recently, I discovered an incredibly refreshing/affirming essay wrapped in a hand-build web experience called “<a href="https://neustadt.fr/essays/the-small-web/">Rediscovering the Small Web</a>” by designer <a href="https://twitter.com/parimalsatyal">Parimal Satyal</a>, arguing for a different variety of Web presence:</p>

<blockquote><p>Modern web design principles are very rarely directed at regular people looking to make a website on something they are interested in. Instead, the focus is on creating websites that perform well:
<em>Don&#39;t use too many colours. Write short, catchy headlines. Don&#39;t let content be too long. Optimise for SEO. Produce video content, attention span is decreasing. Have a an obvious call to action. Push your newsletter. Keep important information above the fold. Don&#39;t make users think. Follow conventions.</em></p></blockquote>

<p>I realize that the majority of Web utilization cannot “revert” to hand-coded plain HTML web pages hosted on Neocities, but there&#39;s something to be learned (or remembered, in my case) from Satyal&#39;s argument: <strong>The Web&#39;s forgotten strength is <u>diversity</u></strong> (much like my country&#39;s, it would seem,) and the majority of users are being pushed by Google&#39;s search engine toward a very specific minority of URLs. We have not been <em>exploring</em> for a very long time:</p>

<blockquote><p>Instead of browsing, the web is for many an endless and often overwhelming stream of content and commentary picked out by algorithms based on what they think you already like and will engage with. It&#39;s the opposite of exploration.</p></blockquote>

<p>“It is worth remembering a website does not have to be a product; it can also be art,” argues Satyal. “The web is also a creative and cultural space that <strong>need not confine itself to the conventions defined by commercial product design and marketing</strong>.” (Emphasis mine.) It&#39;s not just that The Web was <em>meant</em> to be more – nostalgia is definitely not my particular trip, if you didn&#39;t know – it&#39;s that it <em>can</em> be so much more. My <a href="../../open.html">list of favorite Open Web projects</a> contains just a few examples of what I mean.</p>

<p>It&#39;s possible I am being <em>too</em> critical of Google. A <a href="https://twitter.com/search?f=live&q=%22https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2020%2F5%2F28%2F21272543%2Fgoogle-search-results-page-experience-load-time-contentfu-paint-layout-shift-top-stories-amp%22">Twitter search</a> for the link to <em>The Verge</em>&#39;s article reveals commentary like “<a href="https://twitter.com/carlosriverao/status/1266051773472608257">Experience, matters ;)</a>,” “<a href="https://twitter.com/markupgrade/status/1266492831218139137">Web search moving forward</a>,” and “<a href="https://twitter.com/reDDakteur/status/1266078587767177219">Halleluja!</a>,” so there are clearly users who are more than onboard, and not all of what Google has done for the web recently has been detrimental. It was also announced last month that <a href="https://blog.chromium.org/2020/05/resource-heavy-ads-in-chrome.html">Chrome will begin blocking “resource-heavy” advertisements</a> by default and that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/28/21273934/microsoft-google-chrome-edge-chromium-spellcheck-improvements">Google and Microsoft have been working together to improve spellcheck and scrolling in Chromium</a>. There&#39;s not much to feel about these announcements, but – as always – there is a whole lot to feel about Google as a company.</p>

<p>Google has <a href="https://dev.to/chromiumdev/announcing-web-dev-live-a-three-day-digital-event-2640">announced</a> a three-day live digital event at the end of this month (June 30th-July 2nd) in which viewers will “celebrate our community&#39;s actions, learn modern web techniques and connect with each other.” “Over three days, we&#39;ll share quick tips on aspects of modern web development,” explains the company on its <a href="https://web.dev/live/">web.dev/live page</a>. I am planning to attend and bitch as much as I am allowed. <a href="../../subscribe.html">Stay tuned</a> to hear a chronicle.</p>

<h2 id="the-ancient-ip-s-mmo-is-still-online-albeit-with-some-disappointing-discontinuations">The ancient IP’s MMO is still Online, albeit with some disappointing discontinuations.</h2>

<p>I entertained fantasies about a <em>Star Trek</em> MMO since first experiencing the genre through <em>Eve Online</em> and <em>World of Warcraft</em> in early adolescence. The idea of commanding my own starship in a universe of other “captains” alongside a hand-picked bridge crew was a beguiling one to myself and many others. This year, the game celebrated its <a href="https://trekmovie.com/2020/01/29/star-trek-online-legacy-celebrate-10-years-of-sto-with-jeri-ryan-and-sonequa-martin-green/">ten-year anniversary</a> (aligning well with the <a href="../../about.html">continued involuntary beat</a> of this blog.) I’m currently in the midst of my annual check-in with STO and thought an exploration of this most-consequential video game of my life’s history would be an appropriate undertaking.</p>

<p>The execution of today’s final, Arc Games-owned and maintained product is a particularly long and interesting one. As <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2014-11-22-the-game-archaeologist-perpetuals-star-trek-online.html">Justin Olivetti chronicled for <em>Engadget</em></a>, the license for <em>Star Trek Online</em> was originally <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/perpetual-entertainment-to-develop-and-publish-star-trek-massively-multiplayer-online-game">bought</a> and developed on by Perpetual Entertainment, which was assaulted by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150127173934/http:/massively.joystiq.com/2007/12/12/perpetual-plot-thickens-lawsuit-filed">a lawsuit</a> and extensive layoffs in December, 2006. The company was sued by Kohnke Communications for allegedly selling “valuable assets like the Star Trek Online license” to an affiliated entity called P2 entertainment. Clever. A quote from the complaint as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150128203353/http:/www.tentonhammer.com/node/15616">reported by <em>Ten Ton Hammer</em></a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>“On information and belief, the assets transferred to P2 include Perpetual Entertainment trademarks and copyrights, the perpetual.com domain name, and assets related to Star Trek Online, including code and the license… Perpetual received less than market value for the assets it transferred to P2, and the transfer made Perpetual insolvent (or worsened Perpetual&#39;s existing insolvency).”</p></blockquote>

<p><a href="https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Star_Trek_Online_(Perpetual_Entertainment)">Perpertual’s STO</a> was significantly different from today’s MMO. Instead of captaining one’s own starship, “players would have taken on the role of an officer who would be part of a crew of a starship,” echoing old legacy titles like <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2002/02/22/star-trek-bridge-commander-review"><em>Star Trek: Bridge Commander</em></a>.</p>

<blockquote><p>The proposed solution was that players could own smaller ships like fighters and minor spaceships, but the big ones — like the Galaxy class — would instead be adventure hubs with explorable, detailed interiors.</p></blockquote>

<p>I was 14 in 2008 when I joined the original post-Perpetual Entertainment STO IRC channel when the game&#39;s license was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150203103236/http:/massively.joystiq.com/2008/01/14/star-trek-online-is-under-new-management/">first transferred</a> to Cryptic Studios. In fact, this channel was the only reason I left IRC clients open on my computers for years. It was exciting to find a community of people who were looking forward to participating in a <em>Star Trek</em> MMO as much as I was. I originally went by the (very cringey) username “crazyhooligin,” under which my current STO account is <a href="https://ufplanets.com/member.php?13827-DavidBlue=">still registered</a>. In the IRC channel, I met Sata – host of the now-defunct <a href="https://eileenlong-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/g/personal/david_eileenlonglcsw_com/EV9rOQgmdINNpSWg2t_vXLwBMEMHCkqPUHOsoEX58AdkAg">MMO Junkies podcast</a> and ex-Perpetual developer. He and the STORadio crew accepted me into their Teamspeak conversations despite how strange and unsocialized I was. I learned how <a href="https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Star_Trek_Online_(Perpetual_Entertainment)">extensive</a> and <a href="https://johneaves.wordpress.com/2009/06/25/more-vulcans-from-the-perpetual-files/">beautiful</a> their development had been. One wonders what Cryptic did with the original game and art assets and who technically owns them now.</p>

<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Fhed2yKVYwY" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>After <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150203103236/http:/massively.joystiq.com/2008/01/14/star-trek-online-is-under-new-management/">acquiring the rights</a> to make the game in early-2008, Cryptic was legally compelled to come up with a completed product in two years’ time as then-Executive Producer <a href="https://sto.gamepedia.com/Stephen_D'Angelo">Stephen D’Angelo</a> explained on the <a href="https://youtu.be/a0tP0YrlJB0">100th episode of the <em>STOked</em> podcast</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>We were under a very massive deadline to deliver the game. We had acquired the license from Perpetual and Perpetual’s license had an expiration date on it, and we had to ship the game before the expiration date or we would lose the license.</p></blockquote>

<p><em>STOked</em> also provided an excellent historical account of the acquisition entitled “<a href="https://youtu.be/Fhed2yKVYwY">How Cryptic Saved Star Trek Online</a>.” By late-Fall, 2009, <em>Star Trek Online</em> <a href="https://trekmovie.com/2009/10/22/star-trek-online-begins-closed-beta-trekmovie-giving-away-keys/">entered Closed Beta</a>, which I somehow acquired a key for in the name of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100521081251/http:/www.stoholic.com/">STOHolic.com</a> (a blogger site which represents one of my first web projects ever.) I was dual-booting Windows 7 Beta on my 2008 MacBook, which only supported 2 of its 4GB of RAM. The resulting performance was not optimal, but I was tremendously excited just to participate. Somewhere, there are at least three 480p handicam videos of Closed and Open Beta gameplay taken from over my shoulder, but I could not find them at the time of this writing. Comparatively, beta looked drastically different from the property that’s online today. In <a href="https://youtu.be/vH73ATZ96-w">this video of the original entry tutorial</a>, we are introduced to the game’s basic controls by the voice of Zachary Quinto of J.J. Abrams fame as the new Emergency Medical Hologram in godawful dropshadowed text. The lighting is dated, the blue-based user interface even more so.</p>

<p><img src="https://i.snap.as/t0aZwfB.jpg" alt="Star Trek Online Closed Beta"/></p>

<p>The hair was bad and the textures of the armor, worse. So was mine, though. I uploaded two videos under my STOholic name: an <a href="https://youtu.be/pqGll-DZp6s">unboxing of the Collector’s Edition</a> and what appears to be <a href="https://youtu.be/ghUJm9YWiVc">the definitive YouTube tutorial</a> to run <em>Star Trek Online</em> on Mac OSX using the (now defunct) wineskin wrapper. Though I was sixteen years old, I appear to be about eight. Endless waves of ground enemies, pressing the “1” key hundreds of thousands of times to whittle them away with my phaser rifle. There were bugs on top of bugs. My favorite was a swap between one&#39;s ground and space avatars: a gigantic captain would appear in space and a little ship would appear on the ground.</p>

<p>Four years ago, Lead Developer Al Rivera wrote “<a href="https://www.arcgames.com/en/games/star-trek-online/news/detail/10095363-history-of-star-trek-online-%E2%80%93-a-retrospective">History of Star Trek Online – a Retrospective</a>” – a blog post detailing the chronology of the game from its February 2nd, 2010 release date – about a week after my 16th birthday, for which my mom bought me my first and only gaming PC. I have never been very good at video games, and <em>Star Trek Online</em> has been no exception. After 10 years, my main Captain – Ambassador Kuvak – is still not doing adequate DPS to hold my own in <a href="https://sto.gamepedia.com/Task_Force_Operation">Task Force Operations</a>, from what I understand. My 15-16-year-old self chose a Science Captain but wanted to fly the great (engineering/tank-focused) cruisers of <em>The Original Series</em>, <em>The Next Generation</em>, and the latter&#39;s movies. This is possible, but not necessarily advised. Generally, one specs an Engineering Captain to tank, a Tactical Captain for DPS, and a Science Captain for “<a href="https://youtu.be/v5by0pRMNx8">exotic DPS</a>” and light healing. I managed to level a single science character – the original – through to the max ranks using little intelligence and a lot of persistence. Later in life, I’ve learned the patience for a more deliberate approach, but still struggle to make the numbers.</p>

<h2 id="the-exploration-system">The Exploration System</h2>

<p>For many <em>Star Trek</em> fans, <em>Star Trek Online</em>’s combat feels excessive. Or at least, that’s what you’d think. The current reality is that search engine results for “<a href="https://www.google.com/search?ei=b_nEXvrvNZCstQbVuqu4Aw&gs_lcp=CgZwc3ktYWIQAzoECCMQJzoFCAAQgwE6AggAOgYIABAWEB46CAghEBYQHRAeOgQIIRAKOgUIIRCgAToHCCEQChCgAVDFAlidHmDbH2gAcAB4AIABcYgBhhSSAQQzMS4xmAEAoAEBqgEHZ3dzLXdpeg&oq=star+trek+online+too+much+combat&q=star+trek+online+too+much+combat&sclient=psy-ab&source=hp&sxsrf=ALeKk02Vz7pYJlsD1Vn0gDTEJIsbJM6m6g%3A1589967215922&uact=5&ved=0ahUKEwi64-24kcLpAhUQVs0KHVXdCjcQ4dUDCAk">too much combat in STO</a>” are virtually nill. There are some comments on <a href="https://massivelyop.com/2015/03/05/star-trek-online-installs-memorials-for-leonard-nimoy-and-all-those-lost/"><em>Massively Overpowered</em> posts</a>, a <a href="http://www.containsmoderateperil.com/blog/2019/2/27/star-trek-online-non-combat-missions">year-old blog post in <em>Contains Moderate Peril</em></a> by Roger Edwards, an old <a href="https://ideonexus.com/2010/01/25/star-trek-online-explore-strange-new-worlds-seek-out-new-life-and-new-civilizations-and-kill-them-looking-for-science-in-star-trek-online-beta/">Ryan Somna take</a>, and… that’s about it. There was a definite (and entirely reasonable) argument against the amount of combat across the community early in the game’s development, but it looks like the arguers have simmered down and/or given up. This is also reasonable, considering its now ten-year lifespan. The only trouble is that non-combat options in <em>Star Trek Online</em> have actually diminished over the years.</p>

<p><img src="https://i.snap.as/BicLSE5.jpg" alt="Star Trek Online Romulan Borg"/></p>

<p>The original <a href="https://sto.gamepedia.com/Exploration_Cluster">Exploration System</a> was an ingenious and significant idea that “<a href="https://www.arcgames.com/en/games/star-trek-online/news/detail/6002963-exploration-cluster-removal">used automated tools to facilitate large quantities of widely varied content</a>.” Unfortunately, the result was “nothing close to what [Cryptic] originally planned.” Instead of inspiring variety, Exploration Clusters ended up becoming the most repetitive activity in the game – nothing more than a good source of crafting materials. The missions were generic and the environments simply randomly combined segments of the same interior textures. Procedurally generated environments would hit the mainstream conversation years later with <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2016/8/12/12461520/no-mans-sky-review-ps4-playstation-4-pc-windows-hello-games-sony"><em>No Man’s Sky</em></a>, which was written about in two fascinating articles by Raffi Khatchadourian in <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/18/world-without-end-raffi-khatchadourian"><em>The New Yorker</em></a> and Chris Baker in <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-news/no-mans-sky-how-games-are-building-themselves-104779/"><em>Rolling Stone</em></a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>Using procedural generation isn’t simply about offloading the creative process onto an algorithm – the real challenge is that it requires developers to teach an algorithm the difference between good and bad game design.</p></blockquote>

<p>Perhaps if <em>Star Trek Online</em>’s initial development window had not been so limited, Cryptic would’ve had time and resources to pioneer something truly <em>Trek</em> and extraordinary in the exploration system, but it ended up having to kill the idea altogether – no amount of <a href="https://www.change.org/p/cryptic-bring-exploration-to-star-trek-online-and-sto-back-to-the-true-roots-of-star-trek">Change.org petitions</a> could prevent this.</p>

<h2 id="the-foundry">The Foundry</h2>

<p>Perhaps <em>the</em> most innovative feature <em>Star Trek Online</em> contributed to gaming as a whole came to the live server in Spring, 2011. It was called <a href="https://sto.gamepedia.com/The_Foundry">The Foundry</a>, and it allowed players access to a diluted form of the same mission creation tools Cryptic themselves used to create content, enabling the community to publish its own playable stories. The result was a wonder virtually inexpressible in words. In player-made Foundry Missions, I found joy, wonder, sorrow, and insight – truly everything and more than one could ever want from fiction. Throughout 2013-2014 my girlfriend at the time and I ran regular <a href="https://sto.gamepedia.com/Foundry:List_of_missions">Foundry missions</a> together along with couple friends in our fleet. Unfortunately, I cannot remember a single specific mission (aside from <a href="https://youtu.be/zrXTZfHk4HQ"><em>Unholy Alliances</em></a>, I think,) but I remember the storytelling. I remember laughing at, dwelling on, and even crying for the characters we were introduced to. There were farming-oriented missions and some fairly rough drafts, sure, but the vast majority of the content was deliberately and delicately considered, especially the <a href="https://www.arcgames.com/en/games/star-trek-online/news/detail/3027483">Foundry Spotlight</a> series, which highlighted player-created stories of a particular quality and intrigue.</p>

<p><img src="https://i.snap.as/CGCgrAb.jpg" alt="Ambassador Class"/></p>

<p>Last April, however, <a href="https://www.arcgames.com/en/games/star-trek-online/news/detail/11102923">Arc retired the Foundry forever</a> – perhaps the worst possible news – stating “the legacy knowledge required to maintain the Foundry at our quality standards is no longer available,” meaning – as <a href="http://www.containsmoderateperil.com/blog/2019/3/4/cryptic-to-close-the-foundry">Rodger Edwards notes</a> – that all developers with their hands, hearts, and heads in the project had long since departed the company. The community reaction was heartbreaking. On Reddit, a group of mission authors and devotees <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/sto/comments/ayobu4/one_mans_quest_to_save_the_foundry/">committed to capturing</a> as many Foundry Missions as possible on video in the month between the announcement and date of death. User <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/waimser/">waimser</a> lamented the loss of the Foundry as a critical hit to <em>Star Trek Online</em>’s endgame:</p>

<blockquote><p>Once you&#39;ve played through the story missions and built your ship, the foundry is what&#39;s left, and it has some damn good stuff.</p></blockquote>

<p>The group even created a Google Docs spreadsheet to coordinate the effort. Another created <a href="https://www.arcgames.com/en/forums/startrekonline#/discussion/1247628/keeping-up-with-the-foundry-after-the-foundry-general-psa-preserved-content">a thread in the <em>Star Trek Online</em> forums</a> dedicated to “aggregating the various channels with Foundry content and providing those links to you and updating them as necessary.” In <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2020-02-11-how-star-trek-online-managed-to-live-long-and-prosper">an interview for <em>Gamesindustry.biz</em></a>, Al Rivera suggested that the secret to the title’s longevity in which his team had been “strategically successful” was knowing when and when not to make drastic changes. “Don&#39;t change the fundamentals of what players love about your game,” he suggested.</p>

<p><img src="https://i.snap.as/Vuz4d3N.jpg" alt="UFP Fleet Roster"/></p>

<h2 id="community">Community</h2>

<p>Though <em>STOked</em> and <em>STORadio</em> have long since been off the air, the Roddenberry Podcast Network’s <em>PriorityOne</em> is still going strong, having just recorded <a href="https://priorityonepodcast.com/460-rebranding-kirk-casting-groupees-priority-one-a-roddenberry-star-trek-podcast/">its 460th episode</a>. As I discovered last year, the game’s Twitch community is also thriving. <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/layriena">Layiena</a>’s streams are incredible because – while he understands theory as well as the other broadcasters in the STO Twitch community – it’s his incredible skills at live Captain commentary (calling out abilities and other command inputs as if he really is in the captain’s chair.) It may sound cringey (and perhaps it would be to many,) but his thoroughness and accuracy actually 1) make it seem pretty darn cool to me and 2) are hugely valuable in helping the viewer understand what he’s doing. After some three years, I know my one rotation fairly well, but only three or four of its steps by name – not even remotely well enough to do what he does. Unfortunately, it appears as though he’s been inactive since last year.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.twitch.tv/sphynx_sto">Sphynx</a>’s streams also have an especially professional feel – he is excellent at calling out his actions as well, if perhaps without so much intensity. His Norwegian sensibility is wonderful: when I introduced myself as being around in the community since 2008, he remarked “that’s strange considering the game has only been out since 2010.” Nigh-universally common threads among them: imperturbable kindness to their audience and an impressively wholesome commitment to <em>actually having fun</em>. Though I’m far from deeply saturated with Twitch culture as a whole, I’ve watched my fair share of <em>Eve Online</em>, <em>World of Warships</em>, and <em>Gran Turismo Sport</em> streams, and – while all of these have incredible communities – there’s none quite like the sincerity of the <em>Star Trek</em> fraternity.</p>

<p>A few weeks ago, I departed my own derelict STO fleet for the aptly-named <a href="https://ufplanets.com/">United Federation of Planets</a> which has over three thousand (presumably at least semi-active) members in its <a href="https://www.arcgames.com/en/games/star-trek-online/news/detail/9436793">fleet armada</a>. The fleet website has <a href="https://ufplanets.com/member.php?13827-DavidBlue=">user profiles</a>, a <a href="https://ufplanets.com/forum.php">very active forum</a>, and a <a href="https://discord.gg/M6UKBVj">Discord server</a> – everything I could possibly ask for. So far, I have been welcomed with <a href="https://ufplanets.com/showthread.php?78194-Application-DavidBlue=">overwhelming positivity</a>, and I’m grateful. In a prompt posted on both <a href="https://ufplanets.com/showthread.php?78339-Your-Favorite-Part-of-the-Community=">their forums</a> and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/sto/comments/gpyxcm/your_favorite_part_of_the_community/">Reddit</a>, I asked players what their favorite part of the community is. Oddly enough, some of the responses I got from the latter were quite jaded: “I really enjoy the love and respect the PVP community gets. No, wait...” <a href="https://medium.com/swlh/star-trek-online-ten-years-old-still-fun-eacd72b1380">Alex Rowe for <em>The Startup</em></a>:</p>

<blockquote><p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/sto/">The game’s subreddit</a> is full of folks who are tired of the game because they’ve blasted through all the content, but as someone who has only seen about 1/6th of the quests currently in the game, I’m eager to check out more.</p></blockquote>

<p>User <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/JediMasterx4/">JediMasterx4</a> seemed <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/sto/comments/gpyxcm/your_favorite_part_of_the_community/frsanzq?utm_medium=web2x&utm_source=share">particularly disgruntled</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>You can do all the lockbox promo vids you want, but you are going to have to live in reality, no matter where your ego flies off to.</p></blockquote>

<p>However, there <em>were</em> some positives. User <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/ModestArk/">ModestArk</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>What I really like about this community is that it seems to be more grown up than other gaming communities. Maybe this comes from Star Trek itself, since it is more based/focused on science than Star Wars etc.</p></blockquote>

<h2 id="state-of-the-game">State of The Game</h2>

<p>This past January, <em>Star Trek Online: Legacy</em> was <a href="https://www.arcgames.com/en/games/star-trek-online/news/detail/11357563-star-trek%3A-legacy-now-live!">launched</a>, bringing <em>The Original Series</em>-referencing episodes <em>The Measure of Morality</em> parts <a href="https://sto.gamepedia.com/Mission:_The_Measure_of_Morality_(Part_1)"><em>I</em></a> and <a href="https://sto.gamepedia.com/Mission:_The_Measure_of_Morality_(Part_2)"><em>II</em></a> along with a new <a href="https://sto.gamepedia.com/10_Year_Anniversary_Event">10 year anniversary event</a> and the <a href="https://www.arcgames.com/en/games/star-trek-online/news/detail/11351133-command-the-first-klingon%2Ffederation-ship!">Tier 6 Khitomer Alliance Battlecruiser</a> – “the first Klingon/Federation Starship.” I did not participate in the event, save for experiencing the new missions, which I talked about in <a href="../../star-trek-discovery-review.html">my review of <em>Star Trek: Discovery</em></a>. JustGaming4Us produced an excellent, <a href="https://youtu.be/KHhakbz6q8s">in-depth video review</a> of the two missions as well as a <a href="https://youtu.be/M3KJkcCaymA">tour of the event as a whole</a>. I, for one, have never been partial to Shiny New Ship gluttony largely because of how long it took me to “master” my own Intrepid-Class Retrofit – christened the U.S.S. <em>Bataan</em> after the aircraft carrier my grandfather served on in WWII – as much as I have. It took me years to arrange my bridge officer abilities and their keybinds in such a way that I could maintain a fairly-steady dps rotation and I have no desire to go through the process of learning a new ship again. For most veteran players, however, trying out different ships/skill specs is all there is left to do.</p>

<p>Choosing whether or not – or to whom – to recommend the game is an issue best left to actual gaming journalists. In March, <em>Massively Overpowered</em> – the followup project to what was once <em>Massively.com</em> – published <a href="https://massivelyop.com/2020/03/30/mmo-cartographer-boldly-going-into-star-trek-online/">Mia DeSanzo’s account</a> of her first experience in the game:</p>

<blockquote><p>Everything you’ve heard is true. Ground combat is, as multiple sources have told me, “a hot mess.” I don’t think clunky is an adequate descriptor. You’d have to try it.</p></blockquote>

<p>For the same site, <a href="https://massivelyop.com/2020/01/23/why-i-play-is-star-trek-online-worth-playing-in-2020/">Tyler F.M. Edwards argued</a> in January that <em>Star Trek Online</em> is best left to those who already love <em>Star Trek</em>:</p>

<blockquote><p>STO has some things going for it as a video game, and it’s certainly unique in the MMO space, but it has too many basis quality issues for it to be a game I’d recommend to someone who’s never watched an episode of Star Trek.</p></blockquote>

<p>Compared to what I experienced all those years ago in Closed and Open Beta, <em>Star Trek Online</em> is now <em>vastly</em> more polished, but perhaps compared to other MMOs in 2020, it is, indeed, “rough.” In my casual return this past month, I have yet to experience any significant bugs. Considering his character data dates back to launch, I’d like to think that the server is set into some brief, confused panic every time I log in to Kuvak, but perhaps that’s just a fantasy. I have still been enjoying the space combat in the classic Advanced-level <a href="https://www.arcgames.com/en/games/star-trek-online/news/detail/7003293-borg-disconnected">Borg Disconnected</a> and <a href="https://www.arcgames.com/en/games/star-trek-online/news/detail/9527023-star-trek-online%3A-counterpoint">Counterpoint</a> TFOs and my first entry into high-level gear upgrade crafting from the vast cache of materials I’ve built up over the years. . Apparently, my old lockbox collection might actually be worth some significant Energy Credits on the Exchange – as of the time of this writing, however, not a one had yet to sell.</p>

<p><img src="https://i.snap.as/R2MgVJD.jpg" alt="Constellation Class Retrofit"/></p>

<p>If you’re a ship junkie who’s entirely unfamiliar with the property, know that <em>Star Trek</em>’s ships are <em>fucking cute</em>. The <a href="https://www.startrek.com/article/inside-the-nebula-class-starship">Nebula Class</a>, especially, inspires real affection. In my opinion, it alone is worth giving this free-to-play game a shot. My two point eight pound <a href="https://extratone.com/microsoft-surface-laptop-2-review-windows-future">Surface Laptop 2</a> is enough to run it fairly well at medium-high settings, which is an absurdly low barrier-to-entry. You shouldn’t be worried about investing your time, either – <em>Star Trek</em> doesn’t appear to be dying anytime soon.</p>

<h2 id="why-extratone-has-used-discord-instead-of-slack-for-our-team-chat">Why Extratone has used Discord instead of Slack for our team chat.</h2>

<p>Back in 2015, I hosted a pre-<em>Extratone</em> culture podcast called <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2zjkrB28csR68YoY1M1eSk"><em>Drycast</em></a> with musician friends from all over the net. To record remotely, we originally used Teamspeak 3 – a gamer VoIP staple. When I discovered Discord, I thought we&#39;d found podcasting heaven. Originally, the free plan included 128kbps audio in its voice channels, which was nearly twice what we were getting out of our <em>paid</em> Teamspeak server. If I were still podcasting, Discord&#39;s <a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360041721052-Server-Video">just-released server video feature</a> would undoubtedly prove invaluable for live streams.</p>

<p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">are you thankful for Discord?</p>&mdash; ※ David Blue ※ (@NeoYokel) <a href="https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/1261334179352100865?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 15, 2020</a></blockquote>

<p>According to <a href="https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/1261334179352100865?s=20">a poll I ran on Twitter</a>, 2/3rds of all people on Earth are thankful for Discord&#39;s existence. This is not surprising considering what every Discord user is still offered without spending any money at all: community spaces with audio/video and text chat capability, organizable by Twitch and YouTube-integrated roles with a plethora of different permission options, instantly and easily shareable by customizable temporary or permanent invite links through an application that&#39;s about as cross-platform as one can get (Windows, Mac, Linux, Android, iOS, or simply one&#39;s web browser.) Those of us that remember <a href="https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/1244758973867229185">IRC</a>, Ventrilo, and Teamspeak should all consider Discord a tremendous gift.</p>

<p>Never before have so many VoIP, video, and text chat features been offered together, or in such a beautiful package. “What we really did was create an all-in-one voice, video, and text chat app that replaced this constellation of tools that people would use,” said CEO Jason Citron in <a href="https://youtu.be/NNJ2n6XKmmA">an interview with CNBC</a>. Technically in terms of these details, Discord <em>has no competition</em>. Slack offers text and voice chat with its paid plans, yes, but nothing close in terms of video – especially considering <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/8/9/20798559/discord-go-live-private-stream-voice-channel">Discord Go Live</a>, its fairly-new streaming feature, which allows users to stream game video directly to 10 other users in the server. With some jury-rigging, it&#39;s possible to simply screen share this way, which is an essential sell for business video communication applications like Skype.</p>

<p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Does anyone else have a discord server where you&#39;re the only member and you use different text channels to plan your weekly schedules lmaoooo</p>&mdash; Jab got 2 Jabs (@jab50yen) <a href="https://twitter.com/jab50yen/status/1270886743395520512?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 11, 2020</a></blockquote>
<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>“Discord and Slack have many similarities, but Discord is the superior tool,” says <a href="https://medium.com/ardentunited/why-we-use-discord-and-not-slack-500ac8027824">esports team Ardent United</a>. “Discord has voice channels, which allows us to easily chat with our supporters and other team members. Discord also allows us to set user roles and permissions which makes moderation extremely simple.” It&#39;s not just gaming companies, though. Decentralized cloud platform Sia also <a href="https://blog.sia.tech/sia-is-moving-from-slack-to-discord-195f87feb6a6">moved their community</a> to Discord:</p>

<blockquote><p>Its intended audience is gamers, but many large communities have switched from Slack to Discord, including development communities like <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react/blog/2015/10/19/reactiflux-is-moving-to-discord.html">Reactiflux</a> and <a href="https://medium.com/@polymoon/unreal-slackers-is-moving-to-discord-c93492eb0612">Unreal Slackers</a>. It includes an unlimited number of users, unlimited file uploads (with a per-file size limit), unlimited message histories, and really great moderation and spam filtering features.</p></blockquote>

<p>Slack is <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/reviews/slack">often praised</a> for its integrations, but it shares support with <a href="https://zapier.com/blog/slack-vs-discord/">Zapier</a> – a dedicated web integration service which more or less integrates them equally.</p>

<blockquote><p>Slack works with <a href="https://slack.com/integrations">a long list of tools</a>, including Google Calendar, Zendesk, Salesforce, Wunderlist, and dozens of others. If you&#39;re looking for an integration that isn&#39;t immediately obvious, you can always turn to Zapier for help, because Slack is a supported service. Zapier is an online service that creates integrations between other apps and services, without you having to know any code to make it happen.</p></blockquote>

<p>For sharing detailed post embeds, there&#39;s also <a href="https://discohook.org/">Discohook</a>, which I just discovered. Productivity company Chanty&#39;s blog wrote perhaps <a href="https://www.chanty.com/blog/discord-vs-slack">the most in-depth comparison</a> of the two services (emphasis theirs):</p>

<blockquote><p>At their core, Discord and Slack and very similar. Both are <strong>team chat apps</strong> with a similar interface. Both apps have <strong>team communication organized</strong> in channels. The biggest difference between the two is their <strong>target audience</strong>, and of course, their <strong>specific features</strong>.</p></blockquote>

<p>Ultimately, one must decide how relevant the services&#39; respective target audiences are to productivity. For a not-for-profit media organization like <em>Extratone</em>, Discord&#39;s features-for-price ratio is simply too rich to pass up. If you&#39;d like, <a href="https://discord.gg/0b9KQUKP858b0iZF">stop by our server</a> or try out <a href="https://discord.new/Nx7gawD84mMx">our server template</a>.</p>

<h2 id="new-microsoft-office-features-the-powertoys-run-preview-and-a-test-of-edge-chromium">New Microsoft Office features, the PowerToys Run Preview, and a test of Edge Chromium.</h2>

<p>I have no idea why I signed up to attend Microsoft&#39;s virtual 2020 Build Conference, but I did. I thought I&#39;d add my <a href="https://anchor.fm/davidblue">End User</a> commentary to the mix. Sorry. My first event was called “Every developer is welcome, with Scott Hanselman and guests.” Hanselman is listed as a <a href="https://www.hanselman.com/">blogger</a> and <a href="http://hanselminutes.com">podcaster</a> living (of course) in Portland. I&#39;m not a “real” developer, but I know what Microsoft Teams is, and I recognized the event as a desktop screenshare of his calls with different Microsoft employees. There was a <a href="https://twitter.com/JuanKRuiz/status/1262789374128816128">child invasion</a> and a dropped phone. I also noticed the icon for the <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/meet-the-new-microsoft-edge-your-move-google/">“new” Microsoft Edge</a> browser in his taskbar and realized that I hadn&#39;t downloaded it yet. I remedied that for the conference&#39;s sake – I thought it only appropriate that I try to use as much Microsoft software as possible in this context. I also installed the new <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/19/21262060/microsoft-windows-10-launcher-powertoy-spotlight-alfred-download-build">PowerTools Run preview</a> which I mentioned in my <a href="../../poweruser-tips-software-shortcuts.html">tips post</a>.</p>

<p>Build allows an attendee to build one&#39;s own event schedule, but I neglected to find those focused on what I really care about: <strong>Office 365</strong>. As <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/19/21260005/microsoft-office-fluid-web-document-features-build">reported by <em>The Verge</em></a>, <a href="https://eileenlong-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/g/personal/david_eileenlonglcsw_com/EXd7qVaXqRlHlnnllT7_A5gBRw-ypXkANGTIWlzEPlLzQA?e=PrLfh6">Microsoft Fluid</a> is going to change a lot:</p>

<blockquote><p>Microsoft’s Fluid Framework sounds a lot like Google Docs, but it’s actually Google Docs on steroids. Microsoft is so confident it has built the future of productivity, it’s now open-sourcing its Fluid Framework so the rest of the world can help shape what it has created.</p></blockquote>

<p>There&#39;s also <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-lists-150002899.html">Microsoft Lists</a>, which is reportedly going to revolutionize SharePoint Lists into something more modern and useful:</p>

<blockquote><p>It builds off the <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/what-is-a-list-in-sharepoint-93262a88-20ad-4edc-8410-b6909b2f59a5">existing feature in SharePoint</a>, and will let you track progress and data to organize your teams, potentially making the company’s offerings more streamlined and productive.</p></blockquote>

<p><img src="https://i.snap.as/XmboQGr.png" alt="Microsoft PowerToys Run"/></p>

<h2 id="microsoft-edge-chromium">Microsoft Edge Chromium</h2>

<p>As an Office 365 administrator, I basically only use Edge for administrative/management tasks. Otherwise, I can&#39;t imagine a reason to use it over Firefox, Brave, Vivaldi, Chrome, Opera, etc, but I thought I&#39;d give the “new” (as of January) Edge a tryout for your sake and make it my default browser for a day as well as Microsoft&#39;s Bing search engine. There&#39;s also news specific to Build: <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/19/microsoft-edge-gets-a-pinterest-integration-sidebar-search-and-automatic-profile-switching/">Edge is integrating with Pinterest</a>, of all things:</p>

<blockquote><p>Now, Edge will feature a Pinterest-powered tool that will show suggestions from Pinterest at the bottom of a collection. Clicking on that, Microsoft says, will take users to a Pinterest board “of similar, trending Pins so users can quickly find and add ideas relevant to their collection.” Users will also be able to export collections to Pinterest.</p></blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m in no position to “test” a browser, but the new Edge is noticeably faster at rendering pages and much <em>much</em> smoother when navigating between tabs/preference windows. It looks much more like Chrome, which makes sense. Perhaps because my install is absent of third-party extensions, opening new tabs and windows was much faster than my other browsers. I recorded a <a href="https://vimeo.com/420430704">~2 minute demo</a> of normal browsing on <a href="https://extratone.com/microsoft-surface-laptop-2-review-windows-future">my Surface Laptop 2</a>.</p>

<iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/420430704" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>In terms of touch support, Edge remains the only acceptable browser on Windows 10. If you&#39;ve spent money on a new PC recently, chances are your device is touch-enabled. If you&#39;re like me, you&#39;ve already <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4028019/windows-enable-and-disable-your-touchscreen-in-windows-10">disabled it</a>. If not, you&#39;ll find scrolling and navigation in Edge have improved tremendously – it&#39;s like an entirely new browser <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/6/18527550/microsoft-chromium-edge-google-history-collaboration">because it is</a>.</p>

<blockquote><p>Because Edge used a different rendering engine than Chrome or Safari, it meant that it would sometimes have problems on websites. Testing a website against multiple browsers has always been difficult, and because Edge had so little uptake, it meant optimizing for it often fell off the priority list for web developers.</p></blockquote>

<p>I really like how easy it is to mute audio from tabs and how much better <a href="https://write.as">my CMS</a> is rendered. I still prefer Firefox&#39;s method of tab switching (by last-used chronologically instead of in the order presented.) The reader view is smoother than its competitors and offers a beautiful selection of themes as well as the best “Read aloud” feature in the business.</p>

<p><img src="https://i.snap.as/jWqG85f.png" alt="Microsoft Edge Reader View"/></p>

<p>I&#39;m not going to quote you measurements – check out <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3513973/microsofts-new-edge-browser-third-times-the-charm.html"><em>Computerworld</em>&#39;s browser review</a> for that – but I can say that Edge Chromium is using more RAM than Firefox but a bit less than Chrome. <a href="http://office.com">Office.com</a> also looks and works incredibly well. Overall, I&#39;m extremely impressed with Edge Chromium and the improvements to Bing. As of my experiences today, it&#39;s the fastest and smoothest web browser I have, which is a complete flip from that of the old Edge.</p>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="book e-content"><p><img src="https://i.snap.as/2ixUKqT.png" alt="Zalgo Generator for iOS"/></p>

<h2 id="a-powerful-ios-utility-for-fucking-digital-text-with-ruthless-efficiency">A powerful iOS utility for fucking digital text with ruthless efficiency.</h2>

<p>A warning siren sounds louder still for the current state of the <em>Digital Divide</em> than the profoundly ignorant spectacle of Mark Zuckerberg’s drooling, ghoulish interrogators last year from the digital hole of none other than <a href="https://validator.w3.org">W3School’s trusty web validator</a>, which would surely be rated as the Most Anxious Being in History if it were to acquire sentience. The CSS file this very webpage referenced returned no fewer than <em><a href="https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator?lang=en&profile=css3svg&uri=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.extratone.com&usermedium=all&vextwarning=&warning=1">350 syntax errors</a></em> at the time of this writing; <strong><a href="https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator?lang=en&profile=css3svg&uri=http%3A%2F%2Ffacebook.com&usermedium=all&vextwarning=&warning=1">Facebook dot com’s login page</a></strong> set off only 55. For going on a <em>decade</em>, now, the web has continued to expand into a grotesque, diseased mass.</p>

<p>Yet another piece of software I have notably been using for 10 years: the infamous <a href="http://www.eeemo.net/">eemo.net</a> Zalgo web text fucker. Ideally, I’d now proceed to embed some special examples of the hedonistic online text vandalism which the tool enabled me to inflict widely throughout my adolescence. However – as you can probably imagine – <em>searching</em> for these criminally-broken posts using standard tools provided by the services that have hosted them is virtually futile. In retrospect, I do not recall ever eliciting any acknowledgment of Zalgo’s effects, yet I’m positive that at least the <em>majority</em> of my victims set eyes upon the mess at some point – their silence is actually more entertaining than not, I think. Despite my extensive use of the format, I made a point to maintain my total ignorance about the origin of “<a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/zalgo">Zalgo</a>” for the past decade – only spoiling it <strong>in the name of good journalism</strong> for your sake and this review.</p>

<blockquote><p>On forums and image boards, scrambled text began being associated with Zalgo with phrases like “he comes” and “he waits behind the wall.” David Higgins revealed that the text is an ~abuse~ of a Unicode feature that enables the user to combine multiple superscript and subscript characters into a vertical line.</p></blockquote>

<p>By bizarre coincidence or some ridiculously obscure, intractable common cultural thread (which would probably take a lifetime to successfully trace,) <a href="https://octodon.social/@DaveHiggins">Dave Higgins</a> and I were <em>already mutuals</em> on Mastodon before I had any idea his name was at all associated with Zalgo. More bizarre still: Dave must’ve been watching his timeline at the exact moment when I <a href="https://mastodon.social/@DavidBlue/102564857843257870">posted the above quote</a> mentioning him.</p>

<iframe src="https://octodon.social/@DaveHiggins/102565065494333224/embed" class="mastodon-embed" style="max-width: 100%; border: 0" width="300" height="250" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>

<p>Unfortunately, it seems his blog has moved, killing the hyperlink citation in one of the two relevant search engine results for “zalgo”: <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/zalgo">its <em>Know Your Meme</em> page</a>. <a href="https://davidjhiggins.wordpress.com/?s=zalgo">Searching the same term</a> on his new WordPress blog yields <em>absolutely nothing</em>, so perhaps “I deny everything” was a more sincere response than one expected. A thread on <em>Stack Overflow</em> entitled <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6579844/how-does-zalgo-text-work">“How does Zalgo text work?”</a> explains the fuckery in more detail than I ever could:</p>

<blockquote><p>You can easily construct a character sequence, consisting of a base character and “combining above” marks, of any length, to reach any desired visual height, assuming that the rendering software conforms to the Unicode rendering model.</p></blockquote>

<p>There is something artistic about destroyed text like this – something that&#39;s more than just edgy chaos. I believe in “<a href="https://mashable.com/article/surreal-memes/">surreal memes</a>” that can break Facebook and Twitter posts. I believe in Zalgo, and I believe you need <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/zalgo-generator/id1178473555">Zalgo Generator for iOS</a> on your phone <em>right now</em>.</p>

<p>I don’t want you to think this is just another listicle to mark as spam or ignore completely – though it technically is, I suppose. I know how it looks… because I’ve run into many of them and have been just as irritated as you. In fact, I would be so bold as to presume I’ve run into <em>many many</em> more than you have simply because a primary hobby of mine has always been Just Trying to Do Things On The Computer without any academic authority or hands-on training. This is a way of life for my generation and those proceeding it, yes, but I promise you that I have gone far, far deeper than the vast majority of anyone you know. What I’m ultimately trying to do here is to spare you the hundreds – perhaps <em>thousands</em> – of hours I have had to spend mulling through shitty workflows throughout my childhood and adulthood before I stumbled upon Good Practices (i.e. Better Ways to Do Things.)</p>

<p>I want you to come away from this list feeling as liberated and powerful as I do now when I’m On My Computer without any condescension or tedium. Unfortunately, there’s probably going to be some of both, so please stick with me and don’t take it personally. I do <em>a lot</em> of online reading, writing, and fiddling. I’ve been compelled to do these things in one form or another since very early childhood, and what follows could be described as a list of my favorite tools to accomplish things. Almost all of them are entirely free to use and the vast majority of them are easily and beautifully functional as well. They are what I suggest for my own mother to use, for what that’s worth, and I would argue sincerely for their extreme importance. <em>Don’t waste your life on bad software.</em></p>

<p><img src="https://i.snap.as/fJirMl4.png" alt="Enpass Password Manager"/></p>

<h2 id="you-need-a-password-manager">You Need a Password Manager</h2>

<p>In 2020, password managers are no longer optional for digital life. <strong>They are mandatory</strong>. If you only ever heed a single piece of my advice, ever, <em>please</em> make it this one. <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/picks/the-best-password-managers">Most password managers available</a> are secure, cross-platform, optionally cloud-synced tools that help you generate, store, and organize digital credentials. More likely than not, you’re already using one in your favorite browser. On MacOS and iOS, Safari is linked to a service called Keychain, which is – functionally – a robust password manager. On signup for a given website or service, Safari should prompt you to automatically generate secure, complex passwords to store in Keychain. Generally, it’s pretty smart about knowing when it’s time to retrieve the credentials with Touch-ID, but for when it <em>isn’t</em>, you should know <a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/keychain-access/what-is-keychain-access-kyca1083/mac">how to manually retrieve passwords from Keychain</a>. If you’re deeply enough embedded into the Mac ecosystem, you can feel free to continue to rely on this process as long as you know how to help yourself when it fails. I’m not going to tell you who to trust, but I do <em>almost</em> actually believe in Apple’s commitment to securing user data, if only because of the way their incentives are aligned (in contrast with those in front of data-funded organizations like Google.)</p>

<p>If you’re using a Windows Home Machine and/or an Android smartphone, I believe it’s more urgent that you find a standalone password management solution immediately. I use a gorgeous app called <a href="https://www.enpass.io/">Enpass</a> to store all of my passwords as well as my bank credentials, credit cards, driver’s license information, and anything else I might need to keep handy, securely. I can use virtually any cloud or file-sharing service to keep my “vaults” synced between all of my devices: Microsoft OneDrive, Google Drive, Dropbox, iCloud, Box, etc, and I also regularly create encrypted local backups just in case. I can even <em>share</em> end-to-end encrypted credentials with another device or Enpass installation. I migrated to Enpass two years ago after using <a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/password-managers/best-password-managers-review-digital-security-privacy-ease-of-use/">1Password</a> for nearly 10. It was intuitive and virtually seamless, as such things in software tend to be these days, and as a result, I haven’t had to memorize a single password since my adolescence. Enpass allows me to create custom login templates for quick differentiation when creating new entries as well as picturized categories and tags. With one click, even the icon can be pulled from a given URL’s favicon to help keep my vault looking visually itemized. It also includes presets for a hundred services or so – from Google to Wix to Yahoo! Japan.</p>

<h2 id="total-recall-with-a-clipboard-manager">Total Recall with a Clipboard Manager</h2>

<p>Imagine if everything you had ever copied (as in <strong>Ctrl-C</strong>) were listed in linear order, <a href="https://vimeo.com/407790756">easily and instantly searchable</a> via a single global keyboard shortcut (<strong>Alt-`</strong>) and navigable with the arrow keys. Imagine if you could then export an archive of your clipboard so <em>nothing</em> could ever be lost. Imagine clipboard <em>tabs</em> that are easily switchable. <a href="https://hluk.github.io/CopyQ/">CopyQ</a> – an “advanced clipboard manager” – is one of my favorite software discoveries of all time. Some workdays, I use it literally hundreds of instances in my workflow. It is difficult to describe how much more useful it makes the clipboard feature – something we’ve all been using for decades, now. For someone like me who <a href="https://extratone.com/three-years-of-good-reads">copies a ridiculous amount of links every day</a>, CopyQ’s functionality has truly become <em>life-changing</em>.</p>

<p><img src="https://i.snap.as/G4JSrQb.png" alt="Windows 10 Keyboard Shortcuts - General"/></p>

<h2 id="alt-d-and-other-keyboard-shortcuts">Alt-D and Other Keyboard Shortcuts</h2>

<p>Somehow, I did not discover <strong>Alt-D</strong> until 2018, which means that I had spent the entirety of my 24 years since <em>triple-clicking</em> to select every single URL I’d ever copied. I built a media company this way, and I can’t believe nobody told me about this shortcut. Open any given web browser, use <strong>Alt-D</strong>, and your selection will move to the URL in the address bar on top of the page. It’s very possible this will be of little use to you, but anyone who regularly shares or copies links will save themselves <em>so</em> much time. I felt the same way when I discovered text navigation with <strong>Alt</strong>, <strong>Shift</strong>, <strong>Ctrl</strong> + the arrow keys. Most of these are cross-platform, but I am specifically focusing on <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12445/windows-keyboard-shortcuts">Windows shortcuts</a> for this piece because that’s what I’m currently using.</p>

<h3 id="arrow-key-related-shortcuts">Arrow key-related shortcuts</h3>

<p>·    <strong>Shift</strong> in conjunction with the arrow keys selects text in a document surrounding the cursor.</p>

<p>·    <strong>Alt</strong> in conjunction with the arrow keys allows one to go forward or backward in a browser.</p>

<p>·    <strong>Ctrl</strong> in conjunction with the arrow keys allows one to navigate text by word.</p>

<p>Virtually all of the “Windows logo key” shortcuts are usable in day-to-day workflows. I use <strong>Win-D</strong> to immediately minimize all windows and show the desktop on the regular. Microsoft is <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/17/21224904/microsoft-windows-10-launcher-powertoy-spotlight-alfred-details">currently testing</a> a feature like MacOS’ spotlight which is triggered with this key.</p>

<blockquote><p>Designed to replace the existing Win + R shortcut, the new launcher will include options to quickly search apps and files across Windows and support for plugins like calculators, dictionaries, and search engines.</p></blockquote>

<p>We can only hope this feature will be as useful as spotlight (which is triggered with <strong>⌘-Spacebar</strong> for you Mac users,) and will be implemented as standard as soon as possible. If you’re not already using basic shortcuts for functions like closing tabs/windows and cut/copy/pasting text, I’d advise you to begin as soon as possible. It can be hard to commit, but I promise it’ll make your life better. Try printing out a list of shortcuts for your particular operating system to keep by your workspace and/or find or create an image of the list to set as your <a href="http://extratone.wiki/net/index.php/s/2Pn5H32yYYrm3bG">desktop background</a> for a while.</p>

<h2 id="learn-markdown-immediately">Learn Markdown Immediately</h2>

<p>While we’re on the subject of text – and hopefully without finding ourselves exploring <a href="https://medium.com/redletters/evernote-dropbox-paper-and-the-history-of-word-processing-9407b2c7afba">the entire history of word processing</a> – I’d like to evangelize what very well might be the Ultimate Formatting Language for digital text. It’s called <a href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax">Markdown</a>, and it’s something you’ve likely already used in one form or another. Technically, Markdown is “<a href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">a text-to-HTML conversion tool for web writers</a>,” but – more importantly – it’s a method of stylizing text which is as simple as possible, easy to universalize, and already quite popular. While <em>Vice</em> argues that Markdown is a “<a href="https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/pa7nbn/slacks-new-rich-text-editor-shows-why-markdown-still-scares-people">power-user tool</a>,” I’d suggest that it’s one everybody should make use of. Though I am currently writing this in Word (for the first time in a good while,) I’m going to <a href="https://slate.com/technology/2012/04/microsoft-word-is-cumbersome-inefficient-and-obsolete-its-time-for-it-to-die.html">pay for it later</a>.</p>

<blockquote><p>A Word file is the story-fax of the early 21st century: cumbersome, inefficient, and a relic of obsolete assumptions about technology.</p></blockquote>

<p>“[<a href="https://lifehacker.com/what-is-markdown-and-why-is-it-better-for-my-to-do-lis-5943320">Markdown] has all the advantages of plain text, but with the organizational power of a word processor</a>,” says <em>Lifehacker</em>. From <a href="https://www.portent.com/blog/copywriting/use-markdown-now.htm">Ian Lurie</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>I once had to convert a Word document to a web page.</p>

<p>Once.</p>

<p>After spending hours deleting mso-style blocks and cleaning up thousands of lines of crap, I swore (and swore, and swore) that I’d never do that again.</p>

<p>So I moved to <a href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax">Markdown</a>. For a writer who publishes mostly to the web, it’s perfect.</p></blockquote>

<p>Before I committed to writing in Markdown and moved <em>Extratone</em> to <a href="https://write.as/about">Write.As</a> – a wonderfully simple, open-source web CMS entirely based on Markdown – I really struggled with text formatting on <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20190126095147/http:/www.extratone.com/">our old WordPress-based site</a>, spending hours cleaning up text from Word, Apple Notes, Dropbox Paper, and Google Docs.

<p><em>Mashable</em> published <a href="https://mashable.com/2013/06/24/markdown-tools/">a formidable list</a> of Markdown editors in 2013, but many are since significantly out of date. Instead, I’d refer you to @awwsmm’s “<a href="https://dev.to/awwsmm/state-of-markdown-editors-2019-2k49">State of Markdown Editors 2019</a>,” which suggests <a href="https://joplinapp.org/">Joplin</a> as the winning pick. Joplin is open-source and syncs across devices using your preferred cloud service, but it requires that all notes be written in a monospace typeface, which I do not prefer. If you have a MacOS-running machine and/or an iOS-running smartphone, you <em>must</em> download and try an application called <a href="https://bear.app/">Bear</a>. It is quite simply the <a href="https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/1063486573197561857">most beautiful</a> piece of software – aesthetically and functionally – that I have ever seen, and therefore the most beautiful possible execution of a Markdown Editor. From <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/2/14785264/evernote-replacement-bear-app"><em>The Verge</em>’s Dieter Bohn</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>Bear uses a simple three-paned design. The largest column is devoted to your current note. A smaller column to the left contains your notes in reverse-chronological order, topped by a search bar. The left-most column contains notes that you’ve pinned, as well as any tags you’ve created to organize your notes — <a href="../../tag%253Arecipes.html" class="hashtag"><span>#</span><span class="p-category">recipes</span></a>, for example. I spent years trying to sort my notes into notebooks in Evernote, only to learn that what I really needed was a faster search box.</p></blockquote>

<p><div style="padding:56.25% 0 0 0;position:relative;"><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/192615466?color=00006b&amp;title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div></p>

<p>As much as I despise the term “seamless,” everything about Bear is its definition. For someone like me, it, alone, almost warrants a reversion to MacOS. If you have the correct platforms, I <em>require</em> you to try it. Unfortunately, there can be no true Windows or Linux equivalent without the work Shiny Frog has done to streamline Bear’s near-instantaneous iCloud integration, but there is one application that can literally simulate its functionality in every other way. <a href="https://typora.io/">Typora</a> is an infinitely-customizable alternative that spans all three platforms with a well-populated <a href="https://theme.typora.io/">themes gallery</a> (including an <a href="https://theme.typora.io/theme/cobalt/">actual copy</a> of my favorite Bear theme.) My installation is not nearly as <em>smooth</em> as Bear, but it’s technically more powerful – bad news for users like me who can’t resist fiddling. I’ve downloaded (and attempted to author/modify) a billion themes for Typora. Bear, by contrast, allows <em>just</em> enough stylistic modification (color theme, a choice list of 7 beautiful typefaces, and sliders for font size, line height, paragraph spacing,) without <em>any</em> access to its internal workings. In this way, it provides the perfect blend of customizability and minimalism. If you tend toward the latter, try an ultra-slim solution like WordPress’ <a href="https://simplenote.com/">Simplenote</a>.</p>

<p><img src="https://i.snap.as/ERQF0xF.png" alt="Telegram Desktop"/></p>

<h2 id="telegram">Telegram</h2>

<p>I ran a poll on both <a href="https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/1252322233181261824">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://mastodon.social/@DavidBlue/104032632147081656">Mastodon</a> yesterday asking “do you still email things to yourself?” Overwhelmingly, my “audience” responded “yes,” which is awfully surprising considering their demographic – young, techish early adopters. Though email is not yet “<a href="https://www.inc.com/john-brandon/why-email-will-be-obsolete-by-2020.html">obsolete</a>” – as envisioned by <em>Inc</em>’s John Brandon in 2015 – it has indeed been replaced by other software in many of its functions, <em>especially</em> the old Mail-to-Self practice. I cannot remember the last time I emailed myself anything – even to transfer photos from my cellular to my computer, as I used to do often. Instead, I use a private <a href="https://telegram.org/faq_channels#q-what-39s-a-channel">Telegram channel</a> to send myself photos, videos, links, text, and any other file up to 1.5GB! There’ve always been plenty of reasons to use the messaging app for general communication – especially since <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/02/24/telegram-saw-8m-downloads-after-whatsapp-got-acquired/">Facebook acquired WhatsApp</a> in 2014. Though press coverage of the application has all but dried up, I would argue there are now <a href="https://medium.com/@sirajea/11-reasons-why-you-should-use-telegram-instead-of-whatsapp-ab0f80fbfa79">more reasons than ever</a> to make use of Telegram in your day-to-day life.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.wired.co.uk/article/episode-256">As of 2016</a>, Telegram had 100 million active users, but it’s certainly experienced its <a href="https://www.abacusnews.com/digital-life/why-telegram-isnt-secure-you-think/article/3014398">fair share of controversies</a>. I see no reason to be worried about encryption or privacy at all, for that matter, for the vast majority of Mail-to-Self cases. If the files you’re sending yourself are sensitive enough to worry about, you shouldn’t be emailing them, anyway.</p>

<h2 id="other-stuff">Other Stuff</h2>

<p>If you’re the sort of person who regularly types out 500+ word text messages (or have to do homework/any real writing) on your smartphone, I have a secret to reveal to you: <strong>most smartphones still have Bluetooth keyboard support</strong>. It may <a href="https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/1144268334353047552">look strange</a>, but yes, you can use a full qwerty keyboard with your phone. Those of us who’ve livestreamed or used screenrecording software know that <a href="https://obsproject.com/">OBS</a> (Open Broadcaster Software) is an absolute gift from Gourd, but <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/31/21201043/streamlabs-obs-mac-streaming-twitch-mixer-facebook-youtube">these days</a>, it’s also easy enough for most computer users to make use of. I’d encourage everybody who can think of a reason to record their screen – to show somebody how to do something, for instance – to download and install it. Finally, I think every Windows user should look into <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/manufacture/desktop/compact-os">compacting their operating system</a> into just the essentials. “Compact OS” is really just a Windows 10 install without <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/2966113/bloatware-what-it-is-and-how-to-get-rid-of-it.html">bloatware</a>: the shit you almost certainly don’t need. If you <em>do</em> find yourself in need of default Microsoft apps, you’ll be able to redownload them instantly from the Windows Store.</p>

<p>I’d been meaning to write something like this for a very long time, so I hope you or someone you know has found it useful. I’m not an authority in the technical sense, but I’ve used every one of these suggestions in my own computing life for years, now, to great benefit.

<h2 id="askeptical-spectacle-in-the-day-to-day-typhoon-of-faith-s-modern-enterprise">Askeptical spectacle in the day-to-day typhoon of Faith’s modern enterprise.</h2>

<p>The year I was given my first generation iPhone was the last of 14 through which my mother was still comfortable enforcing my obligation to attend Sunday morning church service. She and my stepfather had migrated 18 months or so prior from [Suburban Church of Mediocore Dope Christ-Appropriated Lukewarm Dilluted Prog Rock and The Occasional Teachings of Protestant-ish Side-Glances at The New Testament] to the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/23/movies/how-the-true-false-film-festival-and-a-church-work-together.html"><em>New York Times</em>-appointed champion</a> of Columbia Missouri’s <a href="https://www.komu.com/news/mega-church-growth/">20-Year-Long</a> <em>Quirk the Church!</em> Soverignty Crusade: <em>The Crossing</em>. Like its competitors (of which my parents’ previous church had ranked quite poorly,) the blatantly death-cult-sounding House of God includes its own artisanal, latte-equipped coffee shop (I wouldn’t be surprised if it’s <em>actually</em> a Starbucks affiliate at this point,) a regularly-replenished catering table full of doughnuts immediately to the side as one enters, and a sophisticated childcare operation staffed no less thoroughly than my public elementary school.</p>

<p>Since 2007, the church has been expanding from its first home (as a functional place of worship, anyway,) which lies within 1) line-of-sight from one of <a href="https://www.insidephilanthropy.com/dance/2013/7/31/nancy-walton-laurie-ballets-next-best-friend.html">Nancy Walton</a>’s properties, 2) a mile of the southernmost exit off US-63 – mid-Missouri’s primary North⟺South roadway – and includes a powered pump-arrogated pond, though the majority of the acreage is blackened by pragmatically-arrayed big box store-caliber multi-rowed parking. Ye, by night, it is flooded in coordinately-distributed cold white light suspended by the same uniform steel poles which guard long-term airport lots. Naturally, the entry and exit points for the asphalt spread are arranged deliberately opposed so that four figures’ worth of God’s children may be fed, digested, and evacuated through their weekly appointment with Christ as efficiently and <em>hassle-free</em> as possible.</p>

<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0rhSDfm1ZEc" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>God’s ~white~ children become <em>especially</em> sensitive to entirely-trivial delay or other perceived deviation from Their Expectations when inside an automobile thanks to a rampant misconception that simultaneously allows them a renewed sense of control over their environment. Psychoanalytic observation has suggested it is catalyzed by delusions of physical anonymity, exemption from civic responsibility, and a titanically-inflated perception of their personally misattributed contributions to the perpetuation of the universe. This vehicular component of the customer experience is a fundamental ingredient in <em>The Crossing</em>’s stellar member retinenance record – the single metric above all quantifying a Christian organization’s overall effectiveness in accomplishing the faith’s (mostly cross-denominational) evangelistic Prime Directive / General Order Number One as <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+28%3A18-20&version=NIV">abridged by Christ himself</a> to the Pharisees after his resurrection: “go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of [The Holy Trinity].” I did not take the opportunity to sample <em>The Crossing</em>’s baptismal services, but I’m sure sufficient combing of <a href="https://yelp.to/qTKq/U3zCk0HlEY">the church’s Yelp! page</a> would yield as qualitative an analysis of such a “service” as you could possibly imagine. (Notably, it would appear the “lowest” review is <a href="https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-crossing-columbia?hrid=1iW1Q9KCi9WlM3mDzNFvKw&utm_source=ishare">the singular 4/5 star entry</a>.)</p>

<p>I do not mean to disparage <em>The Crossing</em>, specifically nor even organized religion, generally, but instead to emphasize the absurdities which have leapt just as readily into what I’d specifically call <em>The Business</em> of white protestant Christianity over just the course of my own maturation as it has into any other aspect of our lives. The difference, of course, is the universal set of exceptions – and the particular <em>age</em> of said exceptions – which religion maintains, societally. The perspective formed by my own experiences having grown up wholly embedded across the spectrum of white midwestern Christianity – including two years of vigorous and quite academic study of the Bible in a tiny private school headquartered in the basement of a Lutheran church – lends to a particular skepticism, amusement, horror, offense, and existential astonishment that latches my fascination into a not-entirely-voluntary hold.</p>

<p>(Before I go on, I suppose I should also note that it’s been at least two or three years since I last set foot inside the church building at all – my <em>only</em> recent experiences/engagement with <em>The Crossing</em> has been with their digital content from a relative distance.)</p>

<img src="https://i.snap.as/B8TX5h0.jpeg" alt="Apple Leadership Headshots"/></p>

<p>The ludicrous parallels between Apple events and services at <em>The Crossing</em>, especially, come immediately to mind every single time I watch one (live or otherwise,) as they did just weeks ago when I first engaged with <a href="https://youtu.be/psL_5RIBqnY">this summer’s WWDC keynote</a>. Pastors <a href="https://www.thecrossingchurch.com/staff/dave-cover/">Dave Cover</a>, <a href="https://www.thecrossingchurch.com/staff/keith-simon/">Keith Simon</a>, and <a href="https://www.thecrossingchurch.com/staff/shay-roush/">Shay Roush</a> all look, dress, speak, and photograph <em>exactly</em> like Steve Jobs, Tim Cook, Scott Foristell, Jony Ive, and just about any <a href="https://www.apple.com/leadership/">public-facing leadership figure</a> we’ve ever seen giving an Apple Keynote. They’re hilariously interchangeable, as are other explicit aspects of the typical Sunday morning service at <em>The Crossing</em>. As far as I can tell, the church as a whole <em>only</em> uses Mac computers and the projections in the main auditorium/worship hall – mostly sing-along hymn lyrics and referenced bible verses – are exclusively created through Apple’s office presentation software, Keynote, just as the company itself does for its “Keynotes.” This was immediately obvious to me upon first entering that space because <strong>they both use the default theme</strong> – typography, color palette, transition animations and all. Indeed, during the sermons, the three pastors would take command of the slides by fairly inconspicuously clicking what I’d imagine must be a very sweaty Apple Remote in the <em>exact</em> same manner in which Tim Cook and his underlings still do.</p>

<p><strong>I JUST REMEMBERED DAVE EXPLICITLY USING MENTION OF APPLE PRODUCTS IN HIS SERMONS</strong></p>

<p>Nay, the likenesses do not diverge when comparing the fundamentals of the two organizations more broadly: <em>The Business</em> of the faith is very much a <em>volume</em> business, which also describes Apple’s contemporary strategy with perfect precision. It’s been a few years since “<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/ericjackson/2014/06/03/apple-isnt-a-hardware-or-software-company-its-an-ecosystem-company/">ecosystem</a>” ceased to be an exhaustive buzzword in tech media discourse, perhaps because the term falls very short in expressing the change in global Apple <strong>scale</strong>. My recollection of high school biology has failed to produce a scientific substitute, but I find Matt Honan’s “<a href="https://www.wired.com/2014/09/apple-ecosystem/">very lovely swamp</a>” exceptionally said in 2014, but the fact of the swamp’s becoming generally lovelier in the interim – in a less linear fashion than would have been ideal, mind you – leaves ample room, I think, to fear and respect whatever it was that we then called <em>The Apple Ecosystem</em> in 2014 as a <strong>ruling deity or daemon</strong> (just as <a href="https://extratone.com/google-soul-ledger-dont-be-evil">Google’s sought to be</a>, recently.)</p>

<p>The church <a href="https://www.thecrossingchurch.com/livestream/">live streams</a> every fucking <del>keynote</del> sermon in HD on <em>Vimeo</em>, not <em>YouTube</em>. (I had no idea Vimeo offered “<a href="https://vimeo.com/features/livestreaming">professional streaming services</a>” until this moment.) They have a <strong><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/the-crossing/id436071694">fucking iOS app</a></strong> (apparently developed by an outfit called <a href="http://www.subsplash.com">Subsplash</a>, who had the audacity to include analytics meta tags following the <em>root of their website</em> within the in-app attribution button) which features a calendar-bound tool containing full-text preparatory reading material from scripture, on-demand audio and video recordings</p>

<p>I genuinely wonder quite often if the individual who set the digital template for the sign in front of our Portland neighborhoood’s Episcopalian church paused to look at the text he was arranging: “PRAYER REQUESTS BY EMAIL.” I&#39;m not sure any of this really means anything, but it&#39;s sure spectacular to look at.</p>
