Considering my use of Git as a means to track revisions on my own writing, it's important to note that you should feel free to replace all instances of "software" in the above statement with "words," "writing," "expression," etc.

While I appreciate tremendously the work and contribution of [Arlo Bendiken](https://ar.to/2010/01/set-your-code-free) in the form of The Unlicense, I would like to add that I see no need, personally, to make the refutation of Intellectual Property law regarding my own work into some profound ethical statement. As it stands, I have not to my knowledge been the victim of any sort of theft of any kind, and find the suggestion highly unlikely. If I *am*  made aware of such a case, there is certainly a possibility that I may change my mind on this issue, so I suppose I should highlight that **THESE TERMS ARE SUBJECT TO CHANGE**, though I suspect I would be more flattered and/or amused than actually offended. 

I would also like to annotate that my use of this license should not be regarded as a suggestion that anyone else follow my example, or that I "believe in" taking such action regarding one's work, generally. While I did indeed take the time to set up [a repository](https://github.com/extratone/eoi) of John Perry Barlow's "[The Economy of Ideas](https://www.wired.com/1994/03/economy-ideas/)" in a bunch of different document formats, I do not necessarily agree with all of what he argued, especially in the context of the world 27 years later. If you *are* particularly interested in my opinion on the matter for whatever reason, here is what I have to say to you:

The principled beginning of The Open Web was a great moment in history, but - like all historical principles - it is extremely important that we consider *context* and maintain an appropriate level of criticism when looking back on old manifestos written by old white guys. In general, try your best to *be reasonable*.

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="book e-content"><h4 id="by-david-blue-http-twitter-com-neoyokel">by <a href="http://twitter.com/neoyokel">David Blue</a></h4>

<p><img src="https://i.snap.as/xTLb40e.png" alt="UniChar for iOS"/></p>

<p>I’ve nev­er under­stood why I nev­er see <em>any­one</em> mak­ing use of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Unicode_characters">vast cat­a­logue</a> of near­ly 140,000 stan­dard Uni­code sym­bols avail­able in their social media posts, meta­da­ta, or word art. Like replac­ing stan­dard bul­lets in our <a href="http://bit.ly/thetonearchive">week­ly newslet­ter</a> with ◎ (U+25CE,) — prob­a­bly my all-time favorite, or using strings of four char­ac­ters for intro, ad, and sta­tion iden­ti­fi­ca­tion spots on <a href="http://anchor.fm/extratone">Extra­tone Radio</a>. (☉☉☉☉, for instance.) I’d like to think these uses make their expe­ri­ences feel just a bit more unique to users — if only uncon­scious­ly — but I’d long won­dered if I was in fact the last Uni­code enthu­si­ast alive.</p>

<p>The devel­op­ment of <a href="https://apple.co/2twLdBA">Jor­dan Hipwell’s UniChar for iOS</a> would sug­gest oth­er­wise. Its app store page describes it as “a pow­er­ful yet beau­ti­ful Uni­code sym­bol selec­tion app and key­board,” and its <a href="https://unichar.app">gener­ic web­page</a> appears to have <em>tes­ti­mo­ni­als</em> includ­ing a <em><a href="https://lifehacker.com/this-ios-keyboard-app-will-give-you-all-the-unicode-cha-1822994495">real post</a></em> on the Web Site <em>life­hack­er.</em></p>

<blockquote><p>UniChar is a third-par­ty iOS key­board that unlocks the wide wide world of weird Uni­code char­ac­ters. Ser­vice marks, copy­right logos, math­e­mat­i­cal sym­bols, tech­ni­cal signs like Apple’s “splat” icon or radioac­tiv­i­ty indi­ca­tors, and more are avail­able in the stand­alone app as well as the key­board add-on you can use wher­ev­er you need to type some­thing.</p></blockquote>

<p>Wow! I can’t believe I’d pull-quote <em>life­hack­er</em> any­where, but here is an iOS app that  <em>actu­al­ly address­es</em> a reg­u­lar issue of my own in a beau­ti­ful and intu­itive way. I actu­al­ly can­not remem­ber the last time this hap­pened — you’d have to give me a list and a com­pre­hen­sive refresh­er of all the ways I’ve used my iPhones in the past ten years.</p>

<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AS2S9_vBcDs" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>Con­trary to what may seem obvi­ous, UniChar’s char­ac­ter selec­tor is by far the more intu­itive and effi­cient of these two sep­a­rate ways to use it. Even in the free expe­ri­ence, there are sim­ply  <em>too many</em> <em>char­ac­ters</em> in the cat­a­log to rea­son­ably browse in iOS’ old extend­ed key­board. (For the record, I’d like to note that UniChar is tech­ni­cal­ly a “Ref­er­ence Appli­ca­tion,” but I under­stand if you can’t bring your­self to use the term.) Across both the seam­less­ly-inter­change­able gallery and list views, the user can very quick­ly copy a char­ac­ter to the clip­board with 3D Touch, which works so well it’s as if it were meant only for this use from its begin­ning.</p>

<p>In the off chance you’re a long­time lover and devout user of the grander Uni­code col­lec­tion and an iOS user, I hope you’re now expe­ri­enc­ing the same sort of pet­ty enthu­si­asm I felt myself when I dis­cov­ered it. If not, I hope you’ll take away a desire to explore it. I mean… aren’t these smi­leys way bet­ter than any emo­ji? ☺☺☺☺</p>

<h2 id="update">Update</h2>

<p>Despite a hand­ful of reports of crash­ing issues in App Store reviews, Unichar has con­tin­ued to per­form admirably for me. I end­ed up spend­ing $2.99 to unlock the full Unichar­ac­ter key­board as the tremen­dous val­ue of that num­ber for the time and effort it would save myself would be more than worth it. (Actu­al­ly, it’s thanks to Red­bub­ble for send­ing me the first tru­ly usable Inter net Mon­ey I’ve had to actu­al­ly <em>spend</em> on any apps and/or ser­vices in fuck­ing for­ev­er, but you know.) After all this time, I’m still gid­dy that <a href="https://jordanhipwell.com/">some­one else on Earth</a> val­ues these hiero­glyphs as much as I do, and that they knew enough to man­i­fest the per­fect soft­ware to pre­serve them.</p>

<h2 id="the-recent-history-of-the-software-and-services-we-use-to-retain-text-and-how-their-development-affects-our-behavior-on-the-page">The recent history of the software and services we use to retain text, and how their development affects our behavior on the page.</h2>

<p>I have only once in my many using years been gripped by the fear of the Lord because of a software-related event. I was cruising my pitifully ugly Google News feed on an October afternoon in 2015 looking for the last little bit of material for the evening’s episode of <em>Drycast</em>, when I happened to spy the words “<a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/evernote-is-in-deep-trouble-2015-10">Evernote is in Serious Trouble</a>.” I doubt I screamed or anything, but I definitely remember experiencing a very real, full-body shot of adrenaline because <em>my entire creative life</em> was contained at the time within the nearly 40,000 notes I’d amassed on my Evernote account since the service’s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120904074223/http://blog.evernote.com/2008/06/24/evernote-public-launch/">open beta</a> in 2008. In fact, I was in that very moment using it for the live show notes and so began to wonder how I could possibly continue if Evernote were to be suddenly killed dead. For better or worse, though, the “unicorn” would indeed survive to see its tenth birthday this year, though it’s arguably been eclipsed by the notetaking, journaling, and word processing services its features predated and for which it was the most significant forerunner not so long ago.</p>

<p>I’d been using the cloud-synced notetaking service for all of my composition and research gathering since Junior High, when I thought myself extremely clever with my cloud-syncing, iPhone-native notetaking app when I’d watch other students struggling to find a flash drive or log in to their email on school library computers. Since it worked with any browser and my password was memorable (before the brute force apocalypse and the need for password managers,) I could access my documents, mp3s, and images <em>from anywhere,</em> which was actually a pretty big deal — especially as more research and notetaking was required in high school.</p>

<p>Yes, 10 years later, we are <em>swamped</em> with infinite duplicates of documents from our personal clouds, which are now inescapable and plenty — they follow us around from our pockets, purses, and backpacks and rain notifications down upon us for single punctuation mark peer edits, unnoticeable modification conflicts, or sometimes just for the hell of it. There are now what seems like infinitely many available ways to enter, edit, and publish text from wherever you happen to be, and most of them are free, but very few are actually pleasantly executed tools — all of which can all be said of most types of software now. Since tech publications (and even tech <em>bloggers</em> now,) aren’t doing software reviews anymore because you won’t click on them, the task of comparing between the lot so that you might be spared having to mess around with <em>all</em> of them to find out for yourself — the function of consumer journalism — has fallen to myself, alone because the <em>Fear of The Unclicked</em> is not known to me.</p>

<p>To assist me in bearing this terrible burden, you can allocate 1–3 minutes to <a href="http://bit.ly/howwewrite"><strong>take the survey I created</strong></a> about the text-entry tools you use to determine which tools people use at different points in their writing process and across several uses. It would be very much appreciated.</p>

<h2 id="feature-fucked">Feature Fucked</h2>

<p>Reading this via printed PDF, your hypothetical 100% offline grandmother — the successful children’s book author who needs word processing but doesn’t require connectivity because she doesn’t do research or correspond with anyone — might ask <em>well whatever was the matter with Microsoft Word? Surely I don’t need more than that!</em> Technically, she’d be correct in a major sense: Word has been able to sync via Microsoft OneDrive between PC or Mac with iOS or Android for a while now, but I wouldn’t vouch for the latter for any use other than reading or very lightly editing a document because the relationship between the mobile apps and their desktop counterparts is inevitably strained. Because Microsoft Word is such old software, it’s filled with some obscure functionalities I’m sure even its creators have forgotten. Over years and years of development, these tools have been stacked on top of one another so that actually mastering the labyrinth could be a college major in and of itself.</p>

<p><img src="https://i.snap.as/JUh9srV.png" alt="Word Processing Survey Pie Chart"/></p>

<p>Basically, you can tell your grandmother that <strong>Microsoft Word is a huge old bitch</strong>, but it’s still the industry standard for formatting and publishing works at the end of the line. As you can see from our survey results, <strong>58.1% of you use “legacy” word processing software to finish up your first drafts</strong> (as of May 30th,) which makes you more modern than even a slightly-older population, I’d wager.</p>

<p>While we’re on the subject of the old hag, it’s worth pointing out how ridiculously behind the times its open source “alternatives” are. <strong>OpenOffice</strong>’s last major update was the <a href="https://blogs.apache.org/OOo/entry/a_short_celebration_and_then">release of version 4.0</a> in July of 2013, and it’s not correctly scaled for the small, high-DPI displays sold at just about every price level, nowadays. It was okay when I couldn’t afford to pay for a license in high school (and saw no reason to,) but it now looks sort of awful, especially considering that the version of Office (and therefore Word) to which I’m comparing its screenshots is actually <em>also</em> from 2013.</p>

<p>The other, “fresher” open source option of the moment is called <strong>LibreOffice Writer</strong>, and its suite has been attracting a fair amount of praise — I think “<a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/libreoffice-the-best-office-suite-gets-even-better-with-libreoffice-6-0/">every bit as good</a> [as Word]” is taking things a bit far, but its sixth version looks significantly better than OpenOffice on <em>my</em> machine, at least, and generally operates more smoothly as well. That age-old banner of <em>Open Source</em> won’t matter for much longer, though, if all kinds of software continue to be abandoned and substituted with Progressive Web Apps for <a href="http://bit.ly/uselists">no damned reason</a>. Considering how much time some of us have already spent in front of Word, it’s no wonder we’re spoiled: even my 5-year-old edition of Microsoft Office syncs with the app on my iPhone (with some pleading,) and looks <em>extremely</em> crisp. As far as paid featured desktop-class alternatives, there’s just one more: <strong>WordPerfect</strong>, which I have never used or heard anyone else mention.</p>

<h2 id="the-hybrids">The Hybrids</h2>

<p>When it was conceived, <strong>Evernote</strong> pioneered the recipe that now serves as the foundation of the feature development in today’s notetaking and journaling applications, as evidenced by CEO Phil Libin’s unapologetic use of the term “<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2009/12/30/evernote-two-million/">life-logging</a>” in 2009, which sounds bizarre in retrospect because we’re now well-accustomed to easily “snapping geotagged photos” (smartphones had always included location data in their photo files’ meta, but Evernote was the first app to give a user access to the data <em>on their device</em>,) “making voice notes,” or and organizing text notes via advanced categorization and metadata-enabled searchability. These features are essentials in the apps you could accurately describe as “life-loggers” available for download now. Snapchat’s “Memories” especially come to mind, and I’ve long argued that we should <a href="http://bit.ly/redevernote">blame (or praise) Evernote for beginning the era of eternal memory</a>.</p>

<p>The iPhone OS app’s design would even influence Apple’s own <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/9/18/4741724/ios-7-review">additions to its native photo and note applications in iOS7</a>, much further down the line. Its technical doctrine of on-device storage coupled with syncing via The Cloud would inspire both <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/commentary/345839/evernotes-loss-is-onenotes-gain">Microsoft’s OneNote</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/8/3/3212579/the-best-journal-app-day-one">Bloom’s gorgeous DayOne</a>. There was even a “full-featured” <a href="http://howardcodner.blogspot.com/2011/02/nevernote-is-full-featured-evernote-app.html">Linux-running offshoot called NeverNote</a>.</p>

<p>In contrast with Evernote’s relatively busy design, <strong>DayOne</strong> has been the <a href="https://thesweetsetup.com/apps/the-very-best-journaling-logging-app/">best-looking app of any kind on iOS for years</a>. It shipped with the same sort of extensive categorization, but it’s only ever been available on iOS, Android, and OSX — probably because Windows simply doesn’t look good enough. Should you wish, it will add detailed metadata from the moment you begin each journal entry including precise-ish GPS coordinates, an overview of your location’s weather at the time, <em>whether or not you were moving</em>, what song you were listening to, and your step count for the day (now from the Health app.) You have the option of viewing your journal chronologically, by location on a map, or in a social-esque activity feed, and yes — its search function can be filtered by any of these datapoints.</p>

<p><img src="https://i.snap.as/83yczp2.png" alt="Day One"/></p>

<p><img src="https://i.snap.as/ZKsNUvr.png" alt="Day One"/></p>

<p>In 2015, <a href="https://thesweetsetup.com/day-one-updated-with-new-sync-option/">Bloom added iCloud syncing</a> and multiple journals, further closing the functionality gap between the two apps on paper, yet plenty of users continue to tether between the two using IFTTT (including myself for all my Twitter favorites, just to compare.) Within the somewhat forgotten niche of the “life-logging” utility, DayOne is superior and serves well the self-obsessed user who find the little details of their life to be <em>extremely interesting.</em> Last Spring, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2017/4/25/15426678/day-one-book-print-journal">they introduced</a> the option to purchase a stylized physical book of a user’s journal from within the app. As it is currently priced, the 2,674-page book I previewed today containing every single Tweet I’ve favorited in the past 5 years displayed in a delicately-formatted layout would set me back over $365, and would have to be split into 5 separate books (as per the maximum of 400 pages each.) Since I find my life <em>very</em> interesting, I’ve made a note to myself to proceed if/when I ever have that sort of money to throw around.</p>

<p>For the <strong>67.7%</strong> of you who use digital notetaking or word processing software when you “<strong>want to remember something</strong>,” DayOne is the best option available because of its search function and satisfaction-of-use. Though Evernote was once the only app that could “<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/9/4/6103843/best-note-taking-app-iphone">handle everything everything in your head</a>,” it’s a different experience entirely — tailored for work applications, if anything, since DayOne’s growth spurt. The company, itself hasn’t exactly been managed cleanly, either with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/9/29/9420031/evernote-layoffs-office-closures">layouts in 2015</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/12/16/13979778/evernote-privacy-policy-opt-out">a privacy scandal in 2016</a>, but then again, what billion-dollar company doesn’t have its controversies?</p>

<p>Despite having imported my huge catalog of Evernote entries into DayOne, the former often gets stuck, and it’s retained the most irritating habit of all the software mentioned in this column. Because synced entries in Evernote are not live-updated like those in Google Docs or Dropbox Paper, it’s possible to modify or add to a note on one device while it’s open (and static) on another, which is addressed by either duplicating the most recent entry and filing it in the default “Conflicting Changes” folder, or pasting the duplicate of the entire contents above the “old” content in the note, separated by a horizontal line. I’ve yet to figure out the behavior that triggers which fix, but I don’t particularly care — I’ve decided to restrict my Evernote use to my desktop, absolutely. If I haven’t articulated it well enough for you to form a visual, just trust me: <strong>it’s very, very annoying</strong>, and it should’ve been addressed years ago.</p>

<p>It was my stepfather who told me about Evernote and signed me up for that beta. Both of us were then the sort of people who experienced extreme satisfaction in archiving and categorizing stuff (which is probably the most straightforward way to define <em>nerd</em>,) but he was especially and absolutely enthralled with its <a href="https://blog.evernote.com/blog/2008/06/26/web-clipping/">Web Clipper function</a>, which allowed the user to save webpages with “context” — both the metadata (source URL, date) and contents in “the text, images, and links” via their Firefox extension, which was revolutionary from our perspective, and certainly beat the hell out of stuffed, ugly bookmark folders or printed-to-pdfs. However, Web 2.0 was a younger, then and <a href="http://www.websiteoptimization.com/speed/tweak/average-web-page/">significantly more lithe</a> — the average web page is now <em>10 times larger</em> (disclosure: <a href="https://www.igvita.com/2016/01/12/the-average-page-is-a-myth/">“average web page” is a somewhat misleading term</a>, though I think we can probably agree that it’s <em>too fucking big</em>, regardless,) and it’s long past time for us to accept that this technology is no longer a reasonable solution to saved images.</p>

<p><img src="https://i.snap.as/eKdKSyd.png" alt="Evernote Web Clipper"/></p>

<p>Though development on the Web Clipper appears to have continued — it’s now on Version 7.something — the vast majority of the pages you’d want to save on the web (<a href="https://twitter.com/FickleCrux/status/1001763470902099968">except for Linkedin, apparently</a>,) show Evernote’s age as it attempts to clip them — often taking <em>several minutes</em> to yield the product, which is <em>always</em> broken as hell. Don’t take my word for it, though: another one of Evernote’s less-discussed features <em>technically</em> makes it a publishing platform because I can share a note from my account with you, the world, via <a href="http://www.evernote.com/l/ACT8YDUZovlFS6iWaPOsGpW9uVFqlXkt2YQ/">this public link</a>. It’s a clip I took a year ago of <a href="https://www.wired.com/2014/02/myspace_jad/"><em>Wired</em>’s profile of Jad Abumrad</a>, and you’ll notice that it isn’t <em>completely</em> unreadable, but it <em>is</em> ugly and broken. Even after <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/01/17/evernote-attempts-to-simplify-with-its-new-ios-app/">last year’s update</a>, it’s still clumsy, slow, and virtually unusable without a stellar data connection.</p>

<p><strong>Archive obsessives</strong>, I know that Evernote could have become part of <em>your system</em> and over time, you may have built a gargantuan library within it — the perfection of your tagging system’s efficiency and your categorical format’s consistency making it such a treasure that you might think of it in times of duress to calm yourself. I’ve allowed myself to continue using it <em>exclusively</em> for notes in my novel project, so I do understand that it may represent tens of thousands of hours of your time and that losing it would cause you tremendous grief, <em>but</em>… <strong>it’s time to let go</strong> and better your life by exploring the selection of alternatives and their superior capabilities.</p>

<p><img src="https://i.snap.as/Tl62RVD.png" alt="Google Keep"/></p>

<p>As you’d expect, software has changed a lot <a href="https://lifehacker.com/5590027/five-best-mobile-note-taking-tools">since 2010</a>, and the choices available for word processing are now abundant and relatively diverse. As for web clipping, in particular, I would suggest your new browser Vivaldi and its super capable <a href="https://vivaldi.com/blog/seize-the-moment-with-vivaldi-1-7/">full-page capture feature</a>, which I’ve used for everything from snapping a <a href="http://extratone.com/media/alltratodata.png">25.1 MB, 30,000 pixel-high PNG capture of all Extranet data in text form</a> to the <a href="http://bit.ly/extrfonts">photo specimens we submitted to Fonts in Use</a>, to <a href="https://twitter.com/FickleCrux/status/969833640598306817">crisp snips of full words</a>. For comparison, <a href="http://extratone.com/media/jadwired.png">here’s what it captured</a> of that old <em>Wired</em> post on Jad. You’ll notice that while the image is relatively large, none of the article itself has been lost (aside from the featured image, on <em>Wired</em>’s end,) and the resolution is fine enough that you could still crop out quotes or smaller shots to share if you discovered something later. This ability of Vivaldi’s still feels like magic to me, and there are plenty of other reasons to use the browser, but I’ll save that discussion for a later date.</p>

<p>I could cite plenty of pseudoidealistic reasons to <em>never</em> use Google Chrome, Google Docs, Google Keep, or any other Google product, really, mostly because they all look like shit, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/4/16805216/google-chrome-only-sites-internet-explorer-6-web-standards">their browser is swallowing the internet</a>, (along with their “<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/2/13/17006006/google-amp-stories-google-search-slideshows">accelerated mobile pages</a>” project,) and just about everything the company was built on — along with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/17/17365362/google-chrome-secure-indicator-https">what they plan for the future</a> — is completely (and sometimes even <a href="https://gizmodo.com/google-removes-nearly-all-mentions-of-dont-be-evil-from-1826153393">explicitly</a>) opposed to The Open Web, good design, and <a href="http://bit.ly/googlechurch">humanity as a whole</a>. However, I fully realize that idealism doesn’t mean shit when you’re just trying to get the job done, so let’s talk about Keep and Docs.</p>

<p><strong>Google Keep</strong> is part notetaking service and part streamlined, modernized, hassle-free execution of Evernote’s Web Clipper. If you’re already using Chrome or you’re desperate enough for the ability to clip web pages without switching windows for whatever reason that you’d change your browsing habits entirely, you can add its extension to the top task bar — right next to Evernote’s — and use it any time you feel that old archivist itch. The extension will very quickly and smoothly clip the title and URL, along with whatever of your own text/tags you feel like using, but it will <em>not</em> attempt to capture any of the web page’s content (Google already has it somewhere, anyway.)</p>

<p><img src="https://i.snap.as/Uw8kvMU.png" alt="Optical Character Recognition"/></p>

<p>Like all of its kin, Google Keep is particularly <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3026239/android/google-keep-3-years.html">savvy with integration</a>: you can immediately send your clip to a Google Doc, set a reminder, add a collaborator and even <em>draw</em> on any entry. Its party piece in this Tactile Era of touch-enabled laptops and keyboard-equipped tablets is its ability to digitize handwriting or “grab image text,” a novelty technology called Optical Character Recognition, which has been <a href="http://history-computer.com/ModernComputer/Basis/OCR.html">tickling our most stale fantasies for centuries</a>, now. Though I’m sure it’s genuinely appreciated in a handful of especially quaint use cases, somewhere in the world, there’s never going to be an at-scale application for this sort of thing. I know my handwriting is bad, but if <a href="http://bit.ly/keephand">Keep can’t “grab” it reliably</a>, there’s not much sense in using it at all for me, though Google’s Academy for Young Algorithms will certainly make sure to save every one of my motions to capitalize on <em>my</em> time (or yours.)</p>

<p><strong>Microsoft OneNote</strong> is as clunky, busy, and buggy as Google Keep is quick and uninspiring, but that’s probably because it’s much <em>much</em> older than I remember. To demonstrate its web clipping function, I clipped the <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,1273091,00.asp">OneNote portion</a> of <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,1273084,00.asp"><em>PCMagazine</em>’s Microsoft Office 2003 review</a> and exported it into a <a href="http://extratone.com/library/onenote-pcmag.pdf">PDF</a>, which isn’t a straightforward process, but is it useful? No. Because it’s a PDF, it’s almost unreadably low-resolution, yet manages to weigh 1.2 MB. My (cropped) <a href="http://extratone.com/media/onenote2003.png">Vivaldi capture of the same page</a> is 988 kB and nearly impossible to tell apart from the live experience, so why are we bothering with OneNote at all? Well, according to <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/2488890/enterprise-applications/desktop-apps-onenote-vs-evernote-a-personal-take-on-two-great-note-taking-apps.html">Preston Gralla for <em>ComputerWorld</em></a> (the last tech site still publishing worthwhile software reviews):</p>

<blockquote><p>It bristles with note-creation tools for drawing, recording audio and video, scanning images, embedding spreadsheets and reviewing the edits of others (although the abilities of those tools differ somewhat depending on the platform). In fact, its note-creation tools are more comprehensive than Evernote’s.</p></blockquote>

<p>And we begin to see OneNote’s place as the feature-heavyweight of synced notetaking applications.</p>

<blockquote><p>The organization-minded will appreciate OneNote’s basic structure. You create individual notebooks; within each notebook, you can create section groups that contain multiple sections. Each section has individual pages, with each page a separate note. It’s ideal for organizing content with a logical structure.</p></blockquote>

<p>Then again, dearest Preston goes on to express his adoration for Evernote Web Clipping shortly afterwards and he did so just last year, so I won’t really claim to know what’s going on with him (he’s a legacy tech journo.) In my experience with twenty-somethings and younger, the more committed an artist or writer is to their craft, the less interested they are in its tools, but it’s the young ones who need great tools the most before they’re able to settle on and pin down their process. There was only <strong>a single writer</strong> (<strong>3.2%</strong>) surveyed who answered “<strong>when I want to DIGITALLY record something to remember, I use…</strong>” with “<strong>the ‘compose’ function (to publish immediately and/or save for later as a draft) of a web-based text sharing service (Twitter, Tumblr, Medium, WordPress, Facebook, etc.)</strong>,” and <strong>one other</strong> answered “<strong>another text-entry field on my device where it will be saved for later</strong>,” which <strong>four users</strong> (<strong>13.3%</strong>) said they use to “Brainstorm” digitally.</p>

<p>By Question Set 3, the two alternative answers were dropped and for “Outlining” digitally, <strong>45.2%</strong> of surveyees use legacy word processors, <strong>35.5%</strong> use <strong>cloud-based notetaking apps</strong>, and <strong>19.4%</strong> use <strong>the default notetaking program installed on their device</strong>. In omitting alternative options earlier and including web-native CMS editors later, I inevitably shepherded answers within a moderately-wide berth of where my own assumptions would lead their process. It’s interesting that for the last prompt, “<strong>to make the last modifications to my final draft, I…</strong>” a whole <strong>35.5%</strong> reported they would still be using a <strong>cloud-based service</strong> instead of a <strong>legacy word processor</strong> (<strong>58.1%</strong>) or <strong>CMS editor</strong> (<strong>6.5%</strong>), which would suggest that the functionality of these new e-enabled methods of composition has become truly important, indeed.</p>

<p>Though it’s not necessarily unreasonable, it astounds me to consider how many Online users actually compose original drafts of <em>huge</em> works exclusively within publishing and blogging services like <strong>Medium</strong>, <strong>Tumblr</strong>, or <strong>Reddit</strong>, even. We currently cohabitate a literary sphere with <a href="https://kotaku.com/this-smash-bros-fan-fiction-has-3-5-million-words-s-899629991">impossibly massive works of fanfiction</a> that far surpass anything God or The Classics established in the past, and it’s a wonder how many <a href="http://bit.ly/redvonnegut">sour habits</a> have crept into the writing world as a result. For the sake of the experiment (and <a href="http://bit.ly/futureland9">my own education</a>,) I posted some of my recent work on <a href="https://medium.com/@ficklecrux"><strong>Medium</strong></a> and found its composition UI much improved from what I remember and comparable in many ways to those of more recent dedicated document editing/notetaking services, but there’s still whole set of abstract, less-than-technical reasons not to <em>publish</em> on Medium, much less compose there.</p>

<p>Briefly: instead of “<a href="https://blog.medium.com/renewing-mediums-focus-98f374a960be">defining a new model for media on the internet</a>,” CEO Ev Williams and company ended up creating an isolationist community with <a href="https://medium.freecodecamp.org/how-to-write-medium-stories-people-will-actually-read-92e58a27c8d8">hellishly-skewed priorities in craft</a>. Virtually all of what’s actually <em>born</em> on Medium is of a certain soulsucking, less-than-productive quality (notable exceptions include <a href="https://medium.com/@ryandeel">Ryan Dell</a>, <a href="https://medium.com/@davepell">Dave Pell</a>, and work from marginalized voices that would not otherwise be written or published.) Though their founding principles of ad-model disruption are redeemable and entirely sincere, I’m sure, their result doesn’t actually solve anything at all, especially after <a href="https://www.recode.net/2017/1/4/14169348/medium-layoffs-ad-business-model-change">last year’s layoffs and refocus</a>.</p>

<p>As for <strong>Tumblr</strong> and <strong>Reddit</strong>, I’m afraid I’ve never been capable of truly understanding either, but I did blog extensively about cars for the first time 5–6 years ago on the former when it was one of significantly fewer fee-free options for digital publishing, and even then the experience was already casting doubt on the true necessity and existence of blogging platforms like WordPress — especially for web development-abhorring peons like I was at the time. Now, its iOS app is gorgeous, and its editor has ended up rock-solid and surprisingly versatile, yet the state of its community, also, leaves one with little reason to publish aside from a sortof isolationist desire to contribute to <em>the community itself</em>, for Tumblr’s sake.</p>

<p>This is where <strong>WordPress</strong> should outshine everything else as a pure, open-source Content Management System for any and every use by any and every folk with server space, so I thought I’d try out <a href="http://extratone.com/shife">my own fresh, ultra-connected install</a> to see how its experience has changed. In word processing terms, its <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/wordpress/id335703880">iOS</a> and <a href="https://apps.wordpress.com/d/windows/">Windows</a> clients are <em>lightyears</em> ahead of where they were a few years ago, but to take full advantage of them, one must allow WordPress’ own software access that’s <a href="https://www.wpexplorer.com/jetpack-wordpress-plugin/">not <em>Open Web</em> at all</a>. For light, minimalist personal blogs, a WordPress site offers much more control over one’s intellectual property than Medium or Tumblr, but it’s also significantly less independent than it once was. A quick inspection of my little experiment reveals that 5 out of its 6 content sources are from Google or WordPress properties, leaving only one for <em>my</em> actual server. This means I can accomplish a lot using just their apps, and my work will be distributed among “billions of posts” across WordPress dot com (to be found by absolutely nobody, I suspect,) but the post editor within the CMS itself has never functioned quite so versatility as it does right now. And yet, neither WordPress nor any of the software I’ve covered thus far achieve much progress toward an ideal, comprehensive word processing solution.</p>

<p><img src="https://i.snap.as/wDQtaPk.png" alt="Dropbox Paper"/></p>

<p>That’s why I’d like to talk about <strong>Dropbox Paper</strong>, which has been my own browser’s homepage and primary text editor since <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/8/4/12373696/dropbox-paper-ios-android-sharing-docs">its public beta went live</a> in August of 2016, and it’s very hard not to dote on considering that it is definitively the single most useful software addition in my whole computing life. It’s a live-updating exclusively web-based (for now) service with an emphasis on collaboration, just like the industry-standard monstrosity that is <strong>Google Docs</strong>, but it’s been designed from the ground-up to perform best the operations you need most from a word processor in 2018, which doesn’t include advanced layouts, fine-adjustable paragraph and/or letter spacing, Excel integration, or voice dictation, but simply… typing and re-reading and editing. You’d be surprised what a handy productivity catalyst can become of a simple white, live-updating space without distraction available no matter where you are or what device you’re in reach of.</p>

<p>Virtually <em>all</em> of my “process” is now conducted within Paper, and I’ve never before experienced such an unconscious assimilation of use. I write about software because I’ve used a lot of it and I’ve been able to count on my ability to find fundamental mistakes/designed ignorance in most everything. Dropbox Paper, however, is so keenly perfect for my own needs that I slipped unconsciously into total, daily dependence upon it without noticing the transition at all, which has never, <em>ever</em> happened before. Notes can begin from blank Text/Title fields to <em>Brainstorming</em>, <em>Meeting Notes</em>, and <em>Project Overview</em> templates. In April, the team <a href="https://blogs.dropbox.com/dropbox/2018/04/dropbox-paper-templates/">introduced the ability</a> to “templatize” any document, which I’ve yet to explore but will no doubt make full use of for show notes when <a href="http://extratone.com/futureland"><em>Futureland</em></a> is revived. There are also <a href="https://blog.evernote.com/blog/2017/05/05/uncovering-templates-hidden-gem-evernote/">Evernote templates</a>, yes, but you cannot create your own, and downloading them is an unnecessary pain in the ass.</p>

<p><img src="https://i.snap.as/kn7b2Tx.png" alt="Dropbox Paper Search"/></p>

<p>Landing on the root, you’ll see Folders, Starred Folders, Starred Entries, and Shared Documents all displayed chronologically by modification date. Instead of tags, categories, or “notebooks,” Dropbox Paper’s folders are its singular method of categorization, and they are astoundingly sufficient, even when editing multiple documents simultaneously or digging through professional and personal entries within a single account — all thanks to its search function, which is super-swift and superior to any other service because of its profound simplicity. It’s one of many experiences which laughably shame past efforts in the design of these tools: without any customizable search filters or metadata and <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/help/paper/find-docs">by sifting only through title, content, and author</a>, any note in Paper can be found <em>instantly</em> no matter how dated or obscure. I doubt I’ve yet to top 1000 entries quite yet (there’s no easy way to count, and <em>why should there be</em>, really,) but on several occasions I’ve found years-untouched, untitled documents within seconds — a process which has <em>never</em> been brisk or convenient in Evernote.</p>

<p>Though Dropbox Paper wasn’t necessarily designed for composing 5000+-word longform, it’s by far the best tool for the vast majority of the pre-publishing process (to a reasonable extent, of course — I wouldn’t use it for a screenplay or novel manuscript.) It’s rare for me to utilize its mastery of collaboration, these days, but there’s frankly little reason to go anywhere else — including Google Docs — considering that Paper documents can be bound by the same viewing and editing permissions: by individual entry or folder, marking live modifications with clean, color-coded initials in the sidebar, by email or rogue URL for editing, commenting, and/or reading. (The comments interface is the best I’ve ever seen by a wide margin.) Users can be assigned and “pinged” for tasks using “@,” and it’s reasonable to assume that permissions won’t ever present an issue for my own use considering they haven’t already. To a limited extent, notes can be easily “published” via shared links yet remain editable in realtime, making Paper perfect for obscure-but-public reference documents like <a href="http://extratone.com/style">our style guide</a> and <a href="http://extratone.com/redirection">redirects catalog</a>.</p>

<p>From the onset of use, you’ll marvel at how fucking fast and smooth the in-browser experience is regardless of your device’s age or dimensions. Surprise surprise — the iOS app works just as smoothly and is laid out vaguely like a Twitter client. “Browse” — the chronological timeline of documents — occupies the leftmost bottom button as “Home” — the main timeline — does in Twitter’s app, and “Notifications” is likewise the same icon (practically) in the same position in both, and the items themselves are even grouped with rich card-looking content previews. Perhaps these nods to my Twitter muscle memory have contributed to my own unusual bias, but I suspect it shares components with a particular demographic of professional writers. As I understand the day-to-day activities of a feet-on-the-pavement reporter, Dropbox Paper is a necessity in a ridiculously all-encompassing sense. With its Slack integration, <a href="https://blogs.dropbox.com/dropbox/2017/03/paper-hidden-gems/">super high-usability design</a>, collaborative modularity, ultra copy-and-paste-friendly text, smooth hyperlink behavior, light weight, and ultimate compatibility, it should be evangelized as a no-brainer option in journalism. <em>Fuck</em> a Bic &amp; steno.</p>

<p>Web Clipping may be completely alien to its vocabulary, but you can drag and drop documents in just about any format for a beautifully-embedded preview. Conveniently, <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/help/paper/dropbox-integration">they won’t even count against your Dropbox upload quota</a>: “Dropbox Paper doesn’t place a limit on the number of docs you can create, and includes unlimited version history regardless of the Dropbox plan you are on.” Naturally, this is subject to change in the future, but I’m 95% positive that Paper has yet to refuse any of my uploads because of their size or format, and many of mine are extraordinarily huge.</p>

<p>There is a perfect power to Paper which I can only beg its stewards to leave unmolested for as long as possible. If I was a billionaire, I’d immediately purchase it from Dropbox and leave everything to the company — revenue, janitorial development, user data, etc. — except the right to make any significant feature or functionality additions to the user experience, as I have never before felt this way about a single service or program… <em>ever</em>. I’m not sure if I should keep quiet or incessantly kiss ass, but my interest undoubtedly lies in preserving Paper as it is. If you’re left doubting my own testimonial, there are a billion throwaway “Ditch Google Docs for Dropbox Paper” posts across the B and C-list technosphere. <a href="https://www.gizmodo.com.au/2017/02/5-reasons-you-might-ditch-google-docs-for-dropbox-paper/"><em>Gizmodo’s</em></a>, for instance, notes Paper’s superior formatting freedom, intelligent footprint, incredible embed flexibility, and… independence from the terrible Google God.</p>

<p><img src="https://i.snap.as/w1nbxBE.png" alt="Dropbox Paper iOS"/></p>

<p>Right now, one’s choices in notetaking apps for iOS are almost <em>too</em> varied. There’s <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/review/346353/zoho-notebook-for-iphone"><strong>Zoho Notebook</strong></a>, which claims itself to be “An App Store 2016 Best App of the Year” (falsely, <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2016/12/apple-unveils-best-of-2016-across-apps-music-movies-and-more/">it would appear</a>.) I recall installing it on my 6S Plus, then, after spying some screenshots of its multicolored notes, but I failed to find room for its use. When the (completely useless) Files app was added with iOS 11, I played around with it for a bit and somehow ended up setting Zoho as the default application to open PDFs which inadvertently launched my 8 Plus into an infinite loop of “Open __ in __?” prompts that eventually required deletion of Notebook in order to view them at all. I tend to especially adore these programs in their early, innocent versions when they smell most of innovation before their creators are inevitably brought back to our filthy reality when their VCs start expecting <em>money</em>. Zoho Notebook should have bewitched my affections, but my short trial was clunky and disastrous and those beautifully-colored layouts weren’t quite worth the trouble, so they were missed — to no consequence at all.</p>

<p>The latest favorite is <strong>Bear</strong>, the Markdown-supporting app with which <em>The Verge</em>’s Casey Newton <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/2/14785264/evernote-replacement-bear-app">replaced Evernote for his own use</a>, last year. His authority in writing copy at huge volume is notable if only for his <a href="https://www.getrevue.co/profile/caseynewton"><em>daily newsletter on the business of social media</em></a>, which is always unfathomably gargantuan and clean.</p>

<blockquote><p>Bear lets you tag notes by adding a hashtag to a word anywhere in your document; you can add as many as you like, and then browse them later from the left rail. You can export your notes as PDFs, rich text files, HTML documents, or even JPEGs. And it supports ultra-nerd automation, so if you use an iOS app like Workflow <strong>[</strong><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/4/17414648/siri-update-new-features-apple-wwdc-2018"><strong>now Shortcuts</strong></a><strong>]</strong> you can create shortcuts to your notes.</p></blockquote>

<p>DayOne’s own markdown support and exporting capabilities surely make it Bear’s predecessor. JPEG exports are a nice touch and they reflect awareness of what power notetakers like Newton <em>actually do</em> with their software. If I had not already chosen to <a href="http://bit.ly/spectreinred">depart OSX</a>, long ago, I would seriously consider downloading the app on both platforms and paying its monthly $15 membership fee to try out syncing, but I suspect Google’s moderate but noticeable influence on their design would quickly prove to be a turn-off, personally. I had a go at Bear’s free iOS experience and saw little functional difference from DayOne — if anything, text didn’t look quite as sharp — but its reported integration with Siri Shortcuts is intriguing. (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/03/22/apple-has-acquired-workflow-a-powerful-automation-tool-for-ipad-and-iphone/">Apple acquired Workflow last year</a>, absorbing it into its upcoming iOS 12 release as Shortcuts.) I’d suggest you give it a try — especially if your desktop-class machine is a Mac — and for your sake, I would hope they choose to utilize the power of the modern browser with a web interface in the future. “As a writer, I work in text, and text ought to be simple,” Newton opined, likely with more brevity than I’m capable of in this discussion.</p>

<p>Much of anything has yet to be written about these offerings in 2018, but I must insist both regular and intermittent writers alike give Dropbox Paper a try. I suspect you’ve less “privacy” to “lose” than you would in Google Docs, and its sublime function as a writing tool extends from workplace collaboration to shared grocery lists with your SO and long, image and hyperlink-saturated works like this one. It’s very difficult to break — even by pasting fragmenting code or Zalgo text; it’s never out of date, and always a short, teeny pageload away even across the worst of connections. As someone with an unhealthy obsession with his written work, I can tell you that its UI is by far the most anxiety-relieving I’ve ever used. As an alternative to Google Docs, I would point out that 1) Docs supersedes Paper in sum features <em>significantly</em> less than you’d think and 2) for the one or two weird formatting challenges it fails to complete, neither Microsoft Word — the old bitch — nor Docs are going anywhere, and Paper exports to both of them directly.</p>

<h2 id="the-future">The Future</h2>

<p>Curiously enough, I was required to use every single method of text retention of which I am capable in the course of writing this piece, as I tripped over my laptop’s charging cable — a physical connection, yes (and with substantial leverage) because Apple won’t allow other computer manufacturers to make use of “their” ingenious magnetic charging solution which they’ve included as “MagSafe” on MacBooks since 2008 — perhaps inevitably ruining the port and leaving me with only my iPhone and pens. I filled a few folded sheets of paper with <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BgErFqhFvyT/">my LAMY Safari</a> (which is good, but overrated,) and felt quite ridiculous in the process. Thanks to my fiancé’s generosity, I type this bit now on her Panasonic R440 Electric Typewriter, which must still be considered a legitimate means of writing text in 2018 if only because of <a href="https://theoutline.com/post/2488/collin-andrew-yost-the-most-hated-poet-in-portland">Instagram poetry</a>. According to <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00005QT7B/ref=as_li_ss_tl">its rather dubious listing</a> on Amazon, this model dates to September 4th, 1973, which is remarkable considering its spellcheck and auto-margin functions (neither of which I could actually figure out how to use.) If there is anywhere to be caught clacking away on a typewriter out of preference (I’d hesitate to call even my own situation one of <em>necessity</em>,) in 2018, it would undoubtedly be Portland, yet I am still extremely embarrassed to be the source of all this racket and would immediately perish if any of my neighbors bothered to track it down.</p>

<p>Even this very sophisticated example of the typewriting species is limited by one’s supply of both ink and erasing ribbon, though either can still be found for sale, remarkably. I am even less able to easily correct mistakes than those I wrote by hand because I feel a significant pang of pain via my mechanical empathy every time I use (or accidentally misuse) the function which whites out text with a sickening <em>clunk</em>. There’s something about this process which makes it feel more taxing, costly, and timeconsuming than any other, but perhaps with time and extended use, my embarrassment, empathy, and hesitance would fade and I’d become a cruel, loaded God of shitty prose, but I have no intention of finding out. I’ll willingly concede that restored or refurbished typewriters can be <a href="https://twitter.com/FickleCrux/status/923340941129170944">absolutely gorgeous</a>, and there’s probably some validity in the “distraction-free writing environment,” but I’d suggest that anyone who’s pounded out any significant chunk of copy knows that one must find a groove of absolute focus within a word processor in order to complete work with any efficiency or cohesion, anyway. I’m as connected as any of you, yet these days, I always end up <em>hyperfocused</em> on Word, Dropbox Paper, and/or research in my browser to the exclusion of anything else on the machine, whether or not I intend to do so. I’m no authority, but I can’t see a functional place for a typewriter in 2018.</p>

<p>Portlanders, surely, are vain enough to avoid leaving such disastrous drafts laying about, though now’s a good time to note that one can now scan their typewritten document into a word processor using native software on their smartphone, nowadays, if they’re so unreasonably inclined. Using iOS default Notes app, I could scan this physical draft into Portable Document Format with just a few steps, but doing so would contribute to the ridiculous perception that Adobe’s ancient, clunky standard is the ultimate end of the line for any and all digital publishing. Yes, it’s ridiculous to consider “25 years” of development led to PDF 2.0’s release <em>just last year</em>, to nobody’s glee outside <a href="https://theblog.adobe.com/taking-documents-to-the-next-level-with-pdf-2-0/"><em>The Fucking Adobe Blog</em></a> (which I do believe is running on Medium, hilariously.) Yet throughout my existence, it’s been the go-to half-step between text’s digital and physical forms. The liason, if you will.</p>

<p>Perhaps one could argue that this role in our collective academic Western word processing lives is profound (though no mentally functional human being wants to meet <em>them</em>,) which would inevitably lead them to criticize Adobe’s longtime occupation of it, but to examine the <em>next</em> significant step in the development of word processing is (this moment, at least) extremely hellish and alarming. This “<a href="https://youtu.be/LxviGskApcw">Virtual Reality prototype</a>,” for instance, surpasses even <em>The Soul Ledger</em> as the most distressing online video of all time.</p>

<p>Just <strong>32.3%</strong> of survey respondents claim they print “<strong>at least one draft and use a pen or pencil to make notes/mark corrections by hand</strong>,” not including the additional <strong>6.5%</strong> who “<strong>print at least one draft but make all corrections digitally</strong>,” leaving <strong>61.3%</strong> who presumably do not physically print at all throughout their writing process. Our survey is broad, rudimentary, and not entirely scientific, yes, but I would bet these numbers would contrast significantly with those from respondents exclusively in academia. For myself and my colleagues, there remains “<em>something</em>” that can only be attained by physically manifesting written work, perhaps in requirement of tangible manipulation in order to thoroughly comprehend large bodies of information. As I’ve passed 100,000 words within the rough draft of my novel project, no amount of skimming on any sized screen has enabled me to catch the typos and inconsistencies which become <em>immediately</em> obvious as soon as I have the most current printed manuscript in my hands. I doubt even total immersion into one’s work via some VR-capable word processor would do much to assuage this discrepancy — or much at all, for that matter, aside from casting writers into their own special hell. Surely, only the most self-loathing of them would voluntarily choose to be so dunked. (Read: drowned.)</p>

<h2 id="the-social-network-s-incongruities-better-its-experience-if-you-know-how">The social network’s incongruities better its experience, if you know how.</h2>

<p>On a recent Tuesday, I opened a just-begun <a href="https://www.facebook.com/NASA/videos/10156260187261772/">livestream</a> on Facebook from NASA’s official page with a panel of experts discussing Europa’s plumes (or something like that) and ended up sticking around for most of its hour-long duration because of the ridiculous realtime comments from some of its ~4000 viewers. While some participants were genuinely interested in the opportunity to engage the host’s authority with relevant and invested questions (which were intermittently fielded,) the vocal majority were aggressive, ignorant, and provocative shouts. From my observation, the most noticeably manic and persistent of these came from user <a href="https://www.facebook.com/shane.langman">Shane Langman</a>. “Nasa can telephone the moon in 1969 but can&#39;t get a phone signal in death Valley in 2018,” he noted 16 minutes in. “We cant leave the earth or we&#39;d have left it by now.” And there was Bobby Smith, who felt compelled to express his authority on NASA’s inauthenticity: “[I’ve] been researching since 2012 no real pics of anything all cgi.”</p>

<p><img src="https://i.snap.as/STK8JwB.png" alt="Bobby Smith"/></p>

<p>Assuming the additional all-caps, sans-avatar ranting I remember reading live was deleted after the fact by the culprits and/or the page’s administrator, it’s worth noting that the remaining archive is full of sincerely positive feedback: “It would be awesome to discover life in europe!!” Indeed.</p>

<p>After a few minutes of gawking at the mess, I noticed that the broadcast was being simultaneously <a href="https://www.pscp.tv/NASA/1lDxLapRyjLKm">streamed on Periscope</a> (or is it Twitter Video? or Twitter Live?) so I opened both feeds side-by-side to compare their audience’s behavior. The Periscope’s viewers averaged about 1000 strong, and their comments were noticeably more orderly and decipherable. There was still trolling and self-promotion, but it wasn’t allowed to disrupt the rest of the committed discourse, perhaps because of each post’s character limit or rationed screen time. Looking between them, the contrast in the user culture and the function of the two services during the same, simultaneous stream was at discouraging odds with their respective popularity.</p>

<p>Neither are really very good ways to watch live video – Periscope, notably, was never designed for professional studio broadcasts – but the relentless malicious nonsense from the Facebook viewers pushed all attempts at real engagement away so quickly that I could see no point in making them at all. To be blunt: every conceivable corner of Facebook is an unusable cesspool (even in the shadow of NASA earnestness,) and its worth considering that something about the design of Twitter properties generally discourages such overwhelmingly stupid noise. That’s not to say that harassment, hate speech, misogyny, and radical racism have not been religiously neglected or mishandled as has been well-reported throughout the network’s history – perhaps even more than any other – but I (a cis white man, mind you,) have seen <em>much</em> more of these on Facebook in the wild than I have on Twitter during my longtime use of the two, despite spending exponentially more attention on the latter.</p>

<p>In my sparse Facebook browsing, I have witnessed childhood friends, professional acquaintances, and family members both distant and immediate publicly shame, harass, belittle, and spitefully argue with each other for the sake of absolutely zero meaningful resolution, conclusion, or intellectual progression. In my decade of daily Twitter use, I have seen tens of pedophiles and rapists publicly outed, suicides averted, government censorship circumvented, stories broken, artists made, and marginalized voices outspoken. I have also Tweeted things in the past (mostly variations of “I want to die”) that would now get my account temporarily suspended, as per the company’s <a href="https://mashable.com/2017/10/17/twitter-hate-speech-abuse-new-rules-women-boycott/">latest attempts</a> to minimize its platform’s toxicity – an encouraging suggestion that Twitter is finally catching up and learning to avoid its <em>cultural</em> blunders, which have been the single greatest exception to its most valuable core identity: its mistakes.</p>

<p><img src="https://i.snap.as/xznLHiq.png" alt="Twitter Home"/></p>

<p>Two weeks ago, Twitter <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/official/en_us/topics/product/2018/a-new-twitter-experience-on-windows.html">proudly released</a> the first redesign of its native Windows 10 app since its debut in 2015 – leading a new generation of upcoming “lightweight” Progressive Web Apps and – true to form – immediately reclaimed the title of clumsiest, least-useful Twitter client available. PWAs represent the industry’s readiest effort to “<a href="https://medium.freecodecamp.org/progressive-web-apps-bridging-the-gap-between-web-and-mobile-apps-a08c76e3e768">bridge</a><a href="https://medium.freecodecamp.org/progressive-web-apps-bridging-the-gap-between-web-and-mobile-apps-a08c76e3e768"> the gap between web and mobile apps</a>,” for which expanded compatibility must surely be the best case to make. <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/progressive-web-apps/">According to Google</a> – supreme enemy of the open web and all tasteful design – PWAs are <em>offline-first</em>, <em>instant-loading</em>, and <em>immersive</em> – none of which are reasonable priorities in building a Twitter client for Windows, an operating system running primarily on very powerful hardware. This sort of idiocy can be reasonably expected of Twitter, but bewilderingly, the Great Minds of tech journalism seem to be unanimously pleased by this decision, which invites one to suspect that they’ve all switched secretly to the exclusive, illustrious <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/askjack/2017/may/18/windows-smartphone-still-worth-buying">HP Elite X3</a> – the only smartphone on sale running Windows 10, because Twitter’s execution of these misaligned goals is mindbogglingly foul to look at and unnecessarily frustrating to use. After doing my best to put up with it for a few days, I found myself unable to conceieve of a single advantage this new application has over literally any alternative.</p>

<p>3 out of the 5 bulleted “highly-requested features” listed in their <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/official/en_us/topics/product/2018/a-new-twitter-experience-on-windows.html">announcement</a> are just… catching the app up with the web client as it’s been for years: the 280-character limit, Explore tab, and Bookmarks. “Adding” these web-established operations to an even-more-web-based application surely didn’t present much of a workload, but perhaps <em>removing</em> functionality justified the investment. The F and T keys no longer operate as shortcuts for liking and retweeting, which is such a misguided oversight that I can’t help but wonder if this app was actually intended to be utilized by anyone at all (besides HP Elite users.)</p>

<p><em>Am I missing something? Can you hear me? Are there any flesh-and-blood Twitters users left?</em></p>

<p><img src="https://i.snap.as/FQvW9MC.png" alt="Twitter Poll"/></p>

<p>Then again, the ungainliness of Twitter’s new offspring could be attributed to the perpetual tragedy of its mother’s peril. The company’s luck has been on the down-and-out for eons in tech time: from its most recent <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/change-your-twitter-password-right-now/">plain text password blunder</a>, to its constant inability to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/2/4/7982099/twitter-ceo-sent-memo-taking-personal-responsibility-for-the">handle abuse</a>, its endlessly tumultuous <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2016/06/07/twitter-is-replacing-its-head-of-product-again.html">management turnovers</a>, and its growing disinterest and disfavor among <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/27/16552536/twitter-user-survey-unpopular-abuse-donald-trump">the public</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/10/14/13287818/no-one-wants-to-buy-twitter">potential investors</a> alike – our cultural relationship with Twitter and its identity as a social network remains dramatically tense well past its tenth year, which is good news for its continued survival. One could certainly <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/jan/05/can-donald-trump-save-twitter">argue</a> that the Tump presidency alone spared Twitter from a painful decline into irrelevance (or at least postponed it,) but I think we should acknowledge by now that turmoil is an integral component of the brand as an outlier in the connected community palette.</p>

<p>For myself as a long-dependent occupant, its inconsistencies and contradictions are endearing and necessary – a competent, profitable, and sensical Twitter may as well be Facebook. If you’ve been Tweeting as long as I have, you’ll likely remember that the company’s own offerings had occupied the bottom-most position in the hierarchy of preferable available clients throughout time and across all manner of operating systems until it finally nailed its Android and iOS software and usurped longtime third-party staples like <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/10/01/tweetbot-4-0-becomes-the-best-alternative-twitter-client-for-iphone-and-now-ipad/">TweetBot</a> and <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2015/01/26/twitterrific-5-ios-update-multi-image-support-videos-gifs/">Twitterific</a> just a few years ago. Gadget blogging and <a href="https://youtu.be/DP5Y-58mHic"><em>What’s in my Dock?</em></a> videos may very well be long-dead relics of a different era in tech media, but it’s disheartening to find through research that the steadily-declining quality of our user experience has been allowed to continue without much protest. Justifiably or not, Twitter has persisted in adding stuff nobody likes as they’ve gradually neutered all the great third-party development.</p>

<p>TweetDeck for Windows was perhaps the most powerful mainstream enduser social application that will ever exist. Before <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2011/05/23/twitter-buys-tweetdeck-for-40-million/">Twitter absorbed the tool</a> in 2011, its <a href="https://youtu.be/HQhnbrwBfSw">diverse account integration</a> allowed a user to send a single post across Facebook, LinkedIn, MySpace, Google+, and multiple Twitter accounts simultaneously, and they could configure the client to do so with just the Enter key! In retrospect, it was naive to assume that such potent spam capabilities would continue to be entrusted to the general population without challenge, but the modularity and customizability of TweetDeck prime as a standalone application made it useful as hell and quite the power trip. Now, it exists only as a tamed, up-to-brand-guidelines <a href="https://tweetdeck.twitter.com">web application</a>, yet remains the definitive way to use Twitter on a PC if one desires an ad-free, single-window experience if only because of its congruence with another, even more forgotten feature of the service: <em>lists.</em></p>

<p><img src="https://i.snap.as/lGp1lWB.png" alt="TweetDeck"/></p>

<p>This is how I’ve seen desktop Twitter since I lasted looked at my timeline in 2010. Since then, I’ve followed about 5000 more accounts, so I’d imagine it’s a damned mess. I have a private list of my friends, which I try to read in its entirety, and <a href="https://twitter.com/FickleCrux/lists/the-new">a list of nearly 500 journalists, publications, and musicians</a> whom I’ve found particularly fresh and original. Thanks to these, Tweets are presented in order, uninterrupted by ads. (They function the same on iOS.) The network’s linear chronology is an absolute use condition for me, so I’m thankful I completely missed the <a href="https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/vv7g9d/twitter-is-testing-timelines-that-arent-in-chronological-order">beginning of their progression toward algorithmic relevance</a> thanks to my lists, and as I’ve since happened upon distress from mutuals and non-mutuals over <a href="https://twitter.com/daniellemattoon/status/990079819202351104">missed or stale Tweets</a>, I have taken the time to relay my gospel: <em>lists are linear</em>. And since promoted and sponsored Tweets began overwhelming and perturbing timelines, I’ve seen <a href="https://twitter.com/kikkujo/status/996613451349815296">the displeasure</a> and repeated: <em>lists are linear and ad-free</em>!</p>

<p>I realize how irritating it is when one plays the <em>why doesn’t anyone listen to me?!</em> card, so I’ve created a <a href="https://twitter.com/i/moments/996616971880882176">Twitter Moment</a> to document the confusing silence I’ve gotten in response to these suggestions (though I couldn’t find any cases from the past, so I may be misremembering the extent of my charity,) and pledging to refrain from revisiting this pet advice of mine when writing about Twitter or other social networks in the future.</p>

<p><em>Is my True Tone bullshit on?</em></p>

<p>“True Tone” is so forgettable, everybody had to mention it first. Quite simply, it uses an ambient light sensor to fiddle with white balance, warming the colors of the display as an immediately-obvious whole, yes, but an interesting contrast to show off is no longer inherently justified in being called a “feature” in Apple products, anymore. Essentially, no matter who you ask (aside from <a href="https://youtu.be/AXU8GqaMsQc?t=7m23s">Jon Rettinger</a>,) you <em>should not</em> buy an iPhone 8, though I did last Fall, not only because I had to suddenly decide on a handset in less than 24 hours, but — if anything — to say goodbye to the form, the operating system, and the tech company which I have depended upon and carried with me virtually every day for my entire adult life. I’d originally decided to abandon this review due to a variety of unexpected circumstances, but Apple and its iPhone have maintained their place in the news with their <a href="https://www.apple.com/iphone-battery-and-performance/">battery scandal</a>, and a third of a year with the 8 Plus has included some experiences which warrant a send-off before iOS 12 is released, making it (and myself) totally irrelevant forever.</p>

<p>As the longstanding benchmark of the smartphone industry’s state at any given time, the iPhone can be easy to reflect upon as a product once occupying a state of universal exemption from criticism, but it has, in fact, <a href="http://theweek.com/articles/459748/7-reviews-original-iphone-from-2007">never been so</a>. As Nilay Patel <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/9/19/16323570/apple-new-iphone-8-review-plus-2017">noted</a>, one might regard the 8 as the last compromise of “basically four years” of the same design. Since launch, it’s unsurprisingly stayed a wee bit too far behind on the spreadsheets for most Android-type folks — not that I’ve ever believed them truthfully incapable of comprehending what it means to <em>package</em> a product, given where their greasy startups all eventually ended up. (<strong>You cannot doubt me</strong> — I once took a year-long sabbatical from iOS with a <a href="https://youtu.be/nSWgS0l0kc8">Sony Xperia Play</a>, and my authority is absolute.) The rest are trying to decide whether or not to pay $200 more for “<a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/iphone-8-apples-middle-child-1505322945">the phone of the future</a>,” which knows when you’re watching it, and is only good for playing half an hour of stupid video games before it needs a charge.</p>

<p>So far, I have maintained that my first generation iPhone was the best handset of all time — one hell of an Email Machine that lasted me close to five years — throughout the last two with actual motherboard exposed to the elements in the corner of its cracked screen. That said, who knows how it’d feel to be coerced into using “iPhone OS 2” as it was called, then, for an entire workday in 2018? Two years prior to bringing home an 8 Plus, I <a href="http://bit.ly/drycast47">vowed</a> that my 6S Plus would be my last ever Apple device, but this one <em>actually</em> feels like a last hurrah. Though the ability to <em>Tweet directly from the swipe-down notification menu</em> is still nowhere to be found (it’s been gone for 5 releases, now, and would seem to have been forgotten by <em>literally</em> everyone but myself,) one gets the sense that Apple’s efforts to add to the iPhone 8 and iOS 11 were to make amends with us by settling a few debts.</p>

<p>In part, they did. Native apps got a major overhaul — including Mail, which was startling, considering that I’d been looking at what was near as makes no difference the same UI my eldest phone shipped with. As a result, it alone constitutes my benchmark for an email service, and I have been left without a clue as to what <em>a good one</em> looks like. (Apparently it was <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/article/342889/the-best-mobile-email-client-apps">really bad</a>?) Since time began, there has always been at least one alternative email app of the moment that tech journos refer to as the must-have, end-all replacement. <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/email-edison-mail/id922793622?mt=8">Edison Mail</a> is currently the smoother, faster, most modular option — at least for another few minutes– but I’ll never know it as I know Mail, and I’ll never want to. Playing around with experimental email apps is too scary. What if I decide once again to kill that massive number in the red badge and need to immediately mark 40,000 emails as read? It took all of my iPhone 4’s 1.0Ghz CPU and proprietary software over 18 hours — how am I supposed to trust a shabby little 6-month-old startup with such an important task? Anybody with a hundred bucks can make an app, you know.</p>

<h3 id="why-is-the-app-store-now-the-best-looking-publishing-software-on-ios">Why is the App Store now the best-looking publishing software on iOS?</h3>

<p>One might interpret the App Store’s redesign as an attempt by Apple to control this conversation — of both the trending <em>new thing</em> and the old“essentials” that you’ve probably had tucked away in an untouched folder for years. Technically, whoever the hell is writing those gorgeously-presented daily bits has made them a publishing company, though I’m not so sure I’m not the last remaining user who’s continued semi-regularly visiting their “Today” section. If I <em>did</em> want to actually read about apps (I don’t — who does?) it wouldn’t make much sense to seek critical reviews from the faceless boffins behind the platform itself, regardless of how much better it may look than all of the tech news sites, paywall or no.</p>

<p>Native screen recording could conceivably come in handy once or twice, but I see no reason why the red bar must remain at the top of the render, but it has, which could explain the total lack of any such video in the wild. Front-facing 4K, 60fps capture is impressive, but useless — vloggers all have GoPros or DSLRs, these days, and sharing through Snapchat and Instagram will always be ultra-compressed. (Here are two sloppy test clips — <a href="https://youtu.be/VnfkWkotGFw">at the zoo</a>, and <a href="https://youtu.be/KOs5m6ynKAI">fishing</a>.)</p>

<p>Perhaps some have figured out the new Files “app,” but it’s sat on my homescreen for months, untapped, and it will likely remain there for all time as a sort of soothing trophy — a thanks for my legacy iPhone loyalty. My reward for half a lifetime of syncing, scrolling, and tolling? <strong>I can now view some of the files on my Mobile Computing Device</strong>, and even <em>scan documents in</em>, which is mostly novel (though it is fun to digitize excerpts from physical text.) At some point, I must’ve mischecked a permanent option because all file types now open only in an app that does not recognize them. God bless.</p>

<p><img src="https://i.snap.as/fuMs1a4.jpg" alt="Roof Photo"/></p>

<p>Somehow, I’ve managed to fill my social circle with precisely zero iOS-using folks. All of my friends and colleagues use Android devices (including <a href="https://soundcloud.com/extratonemagazine/nextbit">Tim’s supercool Nextbit Robin</a>,) which provide a few handy datapoints (like the camera in <a href="https://flic.kr/p/BXruaL">my fiance’s Galaxy S8</a>,) but deprive me of any significant experience with the ostensibly intoxicating cult of iMessage. I’m constantly listening to and reading tech writers claim that it’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/10/10/13225514/apple-iphone-cant-switch-pixel-android-imessage-addiction">one of the only reasons they’re still using iPhones</a>, but my own food-OS loving biome has forced me to find others, and frankly, I can’t imagine looking at the <a href="http://www.extratone.com/audio/futureland/toomanymessengers/"><em>gluttonous</em></a> palate of available mobile, cross-platform messaging services (Telegram, <a href="https://telegram.org/blog/telegram-x">now Telegram X</a>, WhatsApp, Signal, Snapchat, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Discord, Slack, <em>Tinder?</em>, Google Hangouts, Google Allo, Google Chat, Viber, Skype, Line, Wire, etc.) and thinking… <em>well, none of this will do</em>!</p>

<p>Honestly — even if I’d actually been at all informed in my haste, the photographic capabilities of the 8 Plus, alone would’ve sold it. It’s not the new filters, gif functionality, or even “3D Photos” — it’s those mythical dual 12MP sensors (which it shares with something called the iPhone X.) They’re no less than infallible. After four months of <a href="http://bit.ly/ip8plus">astonishing captures</a>in all manner of conditions, I don’t even care how exactly they do it anymore — it’s better to be left marveling. This first example was taken at Keystone, Colorado in the middle of a dark, cloudy Fall night — the amount of light they were able to find — “up to 80% more,” <a href="https://www.apple.com/apple-events/september-2017/">according to Apple</a> — is just <em>impossible</em>.</p>

<p><em>The vast majority of the samples in my iPhone 8 Flickr Album were taken within the native Camera app as it ships and left unedited. (Especially before just a few weeks ago, when I <a href="https://extratone.com/race-day-at-hodges">discovered Halide</a>.</em></p>

<p><img src="https://i.snap.as/C2LLJAl5.jpg" alt="Oregon Coast - iPhone 8 Plus"/></p>

<p>Here is an unquestionably sensible progression from which iPhone has never wavered far since its fourth generation <a href="http://www.extratone.com/words/inred/iphone4/">set the standard</a>, but it’s one of an unfortunate few. Siri is still useless and silly apart from its “disable all alarms” feature and its ability to sound itself off in response when you’re hysterically screaming and digging for it through the vast plush of a forty-year-old Lincoln. The customizable Control Center makes toggling low power mode, orientation lock, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth less frustrating (note the last two <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/how-to-turn-off-wifi-and-bluetooth-in-ios11/">aren’t quite hard switches</a>,) though it should’ve come years ago. Notifications are slightly more sensible -certainly better than they were on Android Gingerbread, but I’ve heard things’ve changed quite a bit since then.</p>

<p>I <em>have</em> been tripped up by the lack of a 3.5mm audio jack a few times, but it just <a href="http://www.extratone.com/words/inred/mono/">wouldn’t make sense</a> from a hardware perspective, and the new external stereo capability should refute those who can’t or won’t understand. Yes, it would be nice if Apple hadn’t led the industry to quite such a compromising obsession with thinness — we’d all trade <em>a lot</em>of substance for exponentially greater battery life, storage capacity, water resistance, etc. — but I don’t see much sense in expending your energy holding up signs in Silicon Valley.</p>

<blockquote><p>I’ll be here long after you’ve died, and you know why?
Because I took the time to sync my apps.</p></blockquote>

<p>Two years ago, a new generation of social apps and the preposterous notion of a quad-core CPU in my iPhone 6S Plus seemed like the harbinger of a world I no longer understood. Now, most of those services have expanded to the far boundaries of my reach, and I’ve stopped counting chips. Refinement of the hardware design is reverent to the extreme. It’s pretentious, but Apple’s decision to pause on the 8 to consider details like stuffing the legal text in the software and adding a little bit of weight <em>back in</em> for ergonomics’ sake leads one to regard it as a monument to all the devices along the development timeline that have led to this… last triumph. Or, it would have perhaps, had they not <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2018/02/apple-reports-first-quarter-results/">sold so many</a>.</p>

<p>One could argue that good execution of consumer electronic design means minimizing as much as possible the obstructions in the way of the user completing any given task, and the iPhone 8 Plus has surpassed the vast majority of these for myself — and I am, surely, a “power user.” iOS has changed a lot in the decade I’ve employed it — in far too many ways for the worse — but this pair of handset and software have reached <em>my</em> imagination’s limit for what I could possibly want to do. Augmented reality and wireless charging won’t ever have a place in my future, for better or worse. Face ID is much too peculiar. Surely, this iPhone is the ultimate expression of the first and fourth generation’s foundation.</p>

<p>If the 6S Plus was indeed the key to my immortality, I’m afraid the 8 Plus heralds my imminent demise. Whether or not it’s an early one is for you to decide. This <em>really is</em> my last iPhone.</p>

<h2 id="an-autobiographical-overview-of-my-personal-history-with-technology-and-its-contributions-to-my-current-perspective">An autobiographical overview of my personal history with technology and its contributions to my current perspective.</h2>

<p>Incalculable odds were against my arrival in this world happening in early 1994, positioning my life within a timeline that would allow me to bridge my two species’ most significant millenniums in the first grade as a student in the first class at Fairview Elementary school to receive curriculum-mandated exposure to brand-new Windows 98 PCs in its brand-new, fluorescent-lit computer lab in the center core of its 50-year-old rectangular brick structure. The lab also meant that ours was the first Fairview class to have the available relief of air conditioning during the school day. It’s unlikely that I would be home sick and watching the last television ever allowed in my mother’s living room as the second plane hit.</p>

<p>My peers and I would form a picogeneration without a name (perhaps we should be called the 9/11ers) — 91s and 92s wouldn’t have regular access to public school machines until they’d eclipsed the true prime of their development, and were just that much further along, mentally, to being able to comprehend the huge and terrifying concepts of 1) New York and 2) burning alive — while 98s like my niece were spared any such comprehension of death at all, yet now have to face the existentially future-sundering, darkly-mirrored reality of the Trump Presidency during the most critically uncertain period in the last stage of their brain’s transition to adulthood.</p>

<p>If there is truth in the cross-cultural supposition that souls have some sort of choice, pre-conception, over when they’re born, my own must have either cleaned out the house, or lost horrible, though I suspect I’ll never be able to confidently wager either way. This question of <em>how lucky or unlucky am I to be alive right now</em> is one which I find most fascinating — not just within myself, but within others my age. I declare us a generation largely because of my experiences under the assumption that my mid-Missouri upbringing represents the ultimate average in the American experiences of the time as the area has been a reliable sample of the clearest average of the country’s cultural, political, and economic life. Technically, it was quite unlikely that I arrive here as a new human being instead of China or India, and what if that, too was my choice?</p>

<p>Though less so, it was still against chance that I would be born to parents who would divorce very quickly after my birth, before my mind was able to form any tangible long-term memories, sparing me whatever pain could’ve resulted from their greater togetherness later nullified in front of me. I could’ve chosen them as well for the variety of experiences their situation would allow me as I grew up between my father’s 800-acre farm and my mother’s suburban house in Columbia, the college town an hour’s drive south. I write about my experiences now — so young — because I’ve likely already born witness to more extraordinary changes in human development than your parents, their parents, and their parents’ parents combined. At 24, my life has already spanned by far the most profound and expedited informational renaissance in human history — greater progress was made between the day I first rode a bicycle and the one on which I took my driver’s test than in thousands of years before it.</p>

<p>The sum of my father’s ordeals between 1950 and 1974 — from his birth until the age I am now — would indeed include watching a man set foot on a spatial body other than Earth for the first time, but would be mostly defined by work on the family’s soybean, corn, and wheat farms in central Illinois, driving carbureted tractors pulling cultivating equipment of the same basic design and function as had been pulled by horses, mules, and oxen for hundreds of years, and other implements — like the mechanical multi-row planter — that were new technology at the beginning of the century. For neighbors, he would walk behind the path of a square hay baler next to a moving flatbed trailer, upon which he would throw the 70–100 lb. rectangles of dead compacted grass by their twine through thick cowhide gloves. All of this I would get to experience in the next century on <em>his</em> farm, using the exact same equipment.</p>

<p>At home, he would watch NBC, ABC, and CBS on a CRT TV, as I would for several years until wireless television was legally transitioned to digital statewide in the summer of 2009. As an adolescent, he would form a business with friends cleaning out old abandoned barns in exchange for the rights of ownership to any finds inside, which led to his discovery of a hay-preserved 1929 Buick Sedan containing hand-written records of its every service. This car would change hands into his Uncle’s care as he went off to school in Champaign, married in Georgia, and eventually settled on the flat clay soil of the farm where I grew up, right on the border between Audrain and Monroe counties, Missouri. I was about 10 when we drove back to the family hub with a trailer in tow to collect the car from my Great Uncle, to my manic excitement.</p>

<p>Up until my mid-teens, my life was defined by my extreme reverence for historic cars, airplanes, tractors, and watercraft, and the time I spent operating, maintaining, restoring, or simply studying the assortment of these which I was allowed — often because of extraordinary circumstances — would form the component of my psychology which seeks to experience different cultures, ideas, and eras through the medium of engineering and design and relies on these to understand them. Like my father in his youth, I would learn to clean water out of a carburetor after the Oliver 88 had sat silent for too long, and I would piss in a chamber pot to avoid waking up my Grandfather by walking down creaking attic stairs and turning the lights on. I would learn how to shoot and drive before 10-years-old, and I would have the freedom to do both as I pleased on the miles of gravel roads that ran around home.</p>

<p>Though my stepfather bought me a PC of my own just as my first-grade computer class was ending, I could not conceive of a reason to occupy the dial-up line and block his incoming calls or faxes, so my use of the machine was limited to sparse writing and aggravating attempts to run Microsoft Flight Simulator 98 at approximately one frame per second on a 300MHz single-core Pentium II CPU. Though I was <em>extremely</em> fortunate compared to most middle-class kids my age at the time to have my own computer in my room, my relationship with it was not significant or particularly involved. I would leave it powered down for weeks at a time until my last two grades at Fairview, when homework assignments began to require it.</p>

<p>Perhaps the greatest gap between my mostly-suburbanite classmates and I was an exposure to Japanese entertainment and video games. I was once disallowed from a lunch table because I’d never heard of Pokémon or Luigi, but I <em>did</em> have a Sony Playstation at home on which I occasionally loaded <em>A Bug’s Life</em> to wander around its first level, perhaps in basal awe at the idea of manipulating what I saw on a screen in realtime. In self-imposed isolation from children my age, I wouldn’t develop any need to be socially competitive with video games as many of my peers would to carry with them into adulthood. I thought my interests in mechanical engineering to be above all of them, so I spent my time alone with heavy picturebooks on 20th century cars, tractors, and airplanes.</p>

<p>On the farm, my consistently agriculturally-proactive father was one of the first to have satellite internet for farm futures and weather reports on a pre-GUI machine which I don’t remember. As I was becoming computer literate in school, he would become extremely frustrated with the Windows XP-running machine he’d bought from a one-man, one-room computer shop in Centralia, and I would often solve some problem with bloatware or the goddamned printer. He would also subscribe to and install a first-generation DirectTV receiver, which had the first on-screen program guide I’d ever seen. In the evenings, I would watch hours of <em>Modern Marvels</em> on The History Channel, which presented the history, abstract functional theory, and implementation of a particular technology, both past and future. This single program — which has aired nearly 700 episodes since 1995 — is probably responsible for the majority of my at least rudimentary general knowledge in a variety of historic and “future” technological schools, and my curiosity about culture’s relationship with innovation.</p>

<p>Though my father’s interests differed significantly from mine — he thought more about growing and raising than of the tools one used to do it — he would indulge my many questions about how engines, hydraulics, and electrical systems worked, and indulged my curiosity by exposing me to the hidden communities of the most elderly, most obscure historic machinery enthusiasts like those of the Midwest Old Threshers Reunion in Mount Pleasant, Iowa — the Concours d’Elegance for antique tractor and reciprocating engine collectors. It was a similar event closer to home where I first operated a steam tractor — great, field-going locomotive-like vehicles that supplanted a need for horsepower in the late-1800s up until the Great Depression which chug, whistle, and puff along just like rail locomotives with a huge, gritty, iron steering wheel. As I recall, I was also given the opportunity to drive an unrestored Model T truck around the grounds that day — the knowledge from which I gained I cannot imagine being of much use ever again.</p>

<p>I was proud to the point of arrogance of my technical knowledge and experience in all the different things I had driven and operated, which my schoolmates were in no position to understand. I was elitist and anti-social about this as late as 8th grade, when I had just moved in to stay with my mother, who bought me a first generation iPhone which I proudly wore in a leather belt holster to Junior High. It would represent a shift in my fascination from very old technology toward the present and future.</p>

<p>I started talking online with a friend I’d first met years before at Fairview, who spent most of his time fiddling with his first-generation MacBook Pro. He originally exposed me to gadget bloggers on YouTube like Mark Watson and Jon Rettinger (both of whom are still full-time tech personalities.) My mom bought me a 13-inch aluminum-bodied MacBook (which would be sold as MacBook Pro after a single year,) and my lifestyle radically shifted inside my room, my computer, and my Xbox 360. My friend and I would both obsess together over software, design, and gadget – experimenting with our own tech YouTube channels until high school, where I would be adopted by a new friend group who would finally socialize me.</p>

<p>Recently, I have written about the contrasts and discrepancies of consumer technology development as its progress has disconnected from the upward linear trajectory in use, quality, and genuine innovation for the End User in a departure which has been especially visible from my perspective as an academically-untrained, but intensely demanding user in the past five years. When hardware was still the industry focus before ~2012, there was a tremendous amount of optimism among journalists and enthusiasts because each successive generation of devices had added more tangible capabilities. Publications like <em>Gizmodo</em> and <em>Engadget</em> made a fortune publishing reviews and comparison tests of hardware offerings across every segment of tech, and the discourse they generated had a noticeable influence on design. I remember this time well because it accented my last few years before adulthood, when I had plenty of spare time, energy, and curiosity to keep up.</p>

<p>The general consumer technology narrative since Steve Jobs’ death has become increasingly more about the companies who design and sell hardware and software than about how and why their consumers actually use them, and the result has been a series of new product segments with little defensible place in my own linear timeline of innovation, especially where productivity is involved. Augmented and Virtual Reality are quite explicitly escapist industries, yet to fill any significant need which was before unfilled. The same could be argued about voice assistants and smartwatches — neither of which <em>remove</em> obstacles in most users’ day-to-day lives but instead <em>contribute</em> to the array of tasks and devices which already seek their attention.</p>

<p>Of course, there are defensibly sound business incentives behind the industry’s new, fragmented direction, but I would also argue that there are those, too, for genuinely revisiting both <em>what we should be doing</em> and what we should be seeking to <em>learn to do</em> with technology. In a more abstract sense, I have written about whether or not we should want to be living in this particular now, and how the way we feel about the future should inform what we do in the present.</p>

<p>I cannot help but observe human progress from a perspective of powerlessness, acute alienation, and amused awe, which has already lent to a significant quantity of occasionally original thoughts as I watch, having witnessed an odd diversity of American life and culture. I’ve published them to entertain and to demonstrate a few methods of reflection on what it is <em>you</em> really want from the times you are living.</p>

</audio></p>

<p>Earlier this year, Tim and I had the opportunity to try virtual reality at the True/False Film Festival in a dark, curtained side room of a commandeered Columbia art gallery, but we were both much too intoxicated and loopy those last few hours of the fest, and we bailed. Call us cowards if you must — <em>immersion</em> can be a scary concept to those of us who grew up reading science fiction, before the existence of the modern video game console. I’ve wanted just 30 seconds or so with a pair of goggles, just to have an idea of what the increasing number of Oculus-blinded pedestrians surrounding me are looking at. Thanks to Isiah, I was finally caught up last night with a few VR YouTube videos and <em>Farpoint</em>’s introduction on a PlayStation 4.</p>

<p>First, Isiah brings me the headset and describes in detail how exactly to adjust it, but I forget it all and simply try to shove it directly and violently on my face. Eventually, he takes it back and simply mounts and adjusts it around my monstrous skull — like you would for a toddler — and I lay eyes on the console for the first time. For whatever reason, it never occurred to me that general GUI wouldn’t simply be displayed in 2D, but by a literal <em>virtual display</em>, layed out in front of me like a large, floor-mounted touch workstation. I’m astonished by my ability to turn away from it to look at the rest of <em>Goggleworld</em>, which is nothing but a deeply black void.</p>

<p>From my previous world, I hear Isiah and Hawthorn discussing what to show me first, and YouTube is the settled-upon environment. As the application is restarted in “VR Mode,” its startup screen is what <em>really</em> establishes the truth — I have <em>gone virtual</em>. I cannot use my hands to shield my eyes from the branding’s glaring watermark and terrifying red light. At its home menu, Isiah simply selects the “VR” tab, revealing a selection of thumbnails for algorithmically-recommended VR-shot videos on the service.</p>

<p>To begin, I am mounted on the tail of a superbike as it’s raced around an American desert circuit. It takes a few seconds for high resolution to buffer, leaving me briefly in a pixelized hell that would surely make anyone sick, were they exposed very long. (I was especially excited to become nauseous, to no avail.) At the getgo, I am occupied with the rider’s butt since it’s center-frame if I stand in my usual posture. Isiah points out the hovering HUD to my left containing a selection of simulated digital instruments (tachometer, 7-segment speedo, etc.) Its presence would suggest that the purpose of my virtual passengership is to witness the lap as a motorsport enthusiast, but the rear of the rider obscures most of my view forward — I cannot admire his line as one would viewing a GoPro-or-otherwise POV of the same event, so I decide to try and figure out which track I am hurried through. Though the vehicle is tossed about in the required movements of motorbike operation, I myself (the VR capture device) am impressively gyrostabilized, and the image, static, as if I’m <em>actually</em> hovering above the pair as they moved along. I spin left and right, spotting a small gaggle of miniature wind turbines and two wilting hilltop trees in the foreground. Behind them, small sand dunes fill the space, all the way to the horizon.</p>

<p>After a few minutes, I am finally relieved early of my cutless lap for a short <em>National Geographic</em> documentary on a Viking revival festival in Poland. I’m introduced to its Big Boys by a series of aerial shots (presumably by drone, which is awfully un-Vikinglike) as they row their Big Boat up(?) a relatively wide, tree-lined river. In contrast with the lap, the jump cuts become a bit disorienting — I am eventually jumped <em>in</em> the boat for a moment, next to the sweaty, bearded lads — a few of whom are shirtless. I notice a blurry church on the distant bank. Suddenly, I float briskly across the small no man’s land between two rapidly advancing battle lines of Nordic Nerds with real, era-specific weapons and way too much free time. More lingering drone shots follow from just a few feet above the ensuing conflict. Outside, Isiah confirms Hawthorn’s suggestion that this is, indeed, <em>the one where they use real weapons</em> as I notice a pile of three or four men lying against each other, motionless on the ground, right-of-center in the nearest line, and mull over the sure disturbance of all this immersion the festival has allowed in welcoming the presence of the surely-buzzing drone. <em>I guess they’re dead</em>.</p>

<p>After the conflict, I am subjected to a dreamier, narrated montage accompanied by cheesy synthesized orchestral music and featuring disproportionately a particular man with a shiny, tatted bald head and rather large feet with rather small toes, which he likes to wiggle during these particular conversations. Thanks to VR’s omniencompassing perspective, I am allowed to observe his wiggling in his every appearance. The tone of the background music and the prevalence of relaxed, conversing couples and sunsets in the scenes suggest romanticism is the montage’s theme, but for me, it is the bald man’s feet — I am too busy conversing with my two friends, across the divide, in this world, to listen to any of what is said. Considering that YouTube collects the dimensional data regarding where the user looks, and for how long, I make an effort to bend my neck up and down in extremes, and notice a patch of washed-out sky, distorting in the distance, and ponder what — if anything — we have gained in this technology.</p>

<p><img src="https://i.snap.as/ihtaDMF.jpg" alt="VR Vertical"/></p>

<p>Does an increase in the raw amount of visual data available to the viewer actually make motion picture storytelling more effective? In the few minutes of my VR taste test, I <em>did</em> gain quite a bit of volition over an equivalent 2D experience, but it didn’t seem like I’d instinctively used it to gain much else. If one is specifically interested in the shrubbery around a racetrack, or the more nuanced undulations of a Viking’s foot, they can more likely than not find a standard video on the World Wide Web that would more efficiently entertain them. In specific situations, of course, a producer can undoubtedly benefit by the ability to capture in 360 degrees, but — in any sort of cinema, especially — it seems unnecessarily sacrificial to relinquish entirely the narrative directorial control of shot framing to their audience. However, I am the anti-expert on this subject, obviously. My take on the viability of VR is Virtually Redundant and — quite possibly — very wrong, but my time in its hell is not over yet.</p>

<p>Isiah explains that it is time for me to <em>game</em>, and asks if I’d like to try “the one with <strong>the hands</strong>, or the one with <strong>the gun</strong>.” As always, I choose the firearm, as the “hands” have not been found yet and the hypothetical image immediately offered up by my imagination is of rusty iron shackles. The Infinite Blackness has returned, and I cannot see beyond it to determine what my host is up to. Then, it becomes outer space — filling with thousands of star-like white dots. The light-blue outline of a virtual PlayStation controller appears where I assume him to be, unattached and bumbling about. Soon, it jaggedly approaches, and I feel him hand it to me. We have started its calibration process, which becomes a bit frightening in my celestial surroundings, though at least I have now gained participatory power over my new existence. I’d opted out of wearing headphones, so the assistant’s malignant-sounding female British voice comes softly from the television somewhere in front of me as I point the beam of light the controller’s representation is now projecting straight forward at the navigational arrows displayed ahead and pull “the trigger” (R2.)</p>

<p>I am pleased by the idea of interfacing with software exclusively by shooting it repeatedly before I am abruptly contained in a cage, now being projected by a virtualization of the system’s sensor, which is unsettling. I am now calibrating the hardware contained within the physical device that captures the position of my body in the physical world. I catch the word “confinement” in the assistant’s unending, otherwise-inaudible directions, and quicken my pace. When it’s all done, I return the controller to Isiah, who reboots the PS4, itself, before launching <em>Farpoint</em>. My space becomes a lighter blue and fills with little opaque bits of Sony Dust for a minute or two. Isiah continues his rummaging for another peripheral as the title’s introduction begins to play.</p>

<p>Two rather poorly-animated astronauts are co-hosting a live broadcast from their craft, which is presented in a dramatization of a computer display. They’ve just met, but they’re both stacked with academia, co-massaging their knowledge, which I choose not to listen to. Out of view, Isiah unsuccessfully attempts to skip the whole thing before I’m allowed to become <em>virtual</em> again — this time, atop the animated body of another astronaut in a lone shuttle, approaching the mothership where it holds, next to a large, very-<em>Star Trek</em> “anomaly.” From Deep Space Nine, the two scientists continue to bicker over comms as I look around the cockpit. Looking backwards has already become a favorite habit of mine — I wonder where the shuttle’s bathroom is. For whatever reason, the back of my character’s neck was animated, though it can only be seen by looking rearwards and down, which distorts its shape into something truly terrifying.</p>

<p>A bunch of unrelated plot follows, leading me to end up on a foreign world, exiting my crashed escape pod. By now, Isiah has connected <em>The Gun</em>, but something about it isn’t quite right — my character holds it in a glitched, very uncomfortable-looking manner, and it’s suspected that a fix would require a restart, and therefore — a replay of the introductory cutscene — so I retire out of lack of patience.</p>

<p>If I were confidently reviewing PlayStation VR as a consumer purchase, I’d cite a quote of Isiah’s: “I couldn’t find the thing.” In addition to my first drone sighting, a few days ago in Colorado, this lost virtual virginity is not necessarily unwelcome — I feel as though I’ve acquired a platform to better ponder the dystopia to which these and their like industries add a certain comic spice. That said, I cannot imagine a reason to once again enter the digital realm — and <em>who cares</em>?</p>

<p>Please enjoy your new worlds, kids.</p>

<h2 id="eugen-rochko-has-spent-this-year-perfecting-federated-social-media-in-mastodon-his-open-source-project-we-spoke-to-him-just-hours-before-it-became-a-global-tech-conversation">Eugen Rochko has spent this year perfecting federated social media in Mastodon – his open source project. We spoke to him just hours before it became a global tech conversation.</h2>

<p>The saga of Twitter, Inc. has been rejuvenated in 2017 by Tump&#39;s antics, corporate drama, and an amalgam of user and non-user disquiet with its decisions, though its financial viability has been in prominent industry conversation for half a decade. Since its pre-2010 outset, many &#39;a&#39; feature has accumulated on its original, still-iconic skeletal software, and – though the net is undoubtedly positive – a few have gone.</p>

<p>Last Thursday, the company revised in bravado its poultrian default profile picture and its system of replies to exclude @s on all of Twitter&#39;s proprietary services, drastically changing two of its visual mainstays, and prodding a particularly lucent cacophony. Turn your ear, and you&#39;ll hear many familiar terms in the chants: <em>limits, chains, strings, harassment, feedback, gamergate, nazis, etc.</em></p>

<p>These conversations are important, but they&#39;ve gotten awfully stale.</p>

<p>If you listen a bit more carefully, you&#39;ll intercept a new one:</p>

<p><em>Mastodon</em>.</p>

<p>It&#39;s the open source brainchild of Eugen Rochko, who&#39;s known colloquially as <a href="https://mastodon.social/@Gargron">Gargron</a>.</p>

<p>He&#39;s had one hell of a week.</p>

<p>Between the night of our first emails and our conversation, his flagship <a href="http://mastodon.social/">mastadon.social</a> instance had doubled in users. Less than two hours after we said our goodbyes, his name was on <em>The Verge</em>&#39;s front page.</p>

<p>Despite the urgency of it all, he graciously lent me his time just after breakfast on Tuesday to discuss himself and the story behind the project, while the most significant day of his life was building around him.</p>

<p>“I&#39;m perfectly fine with being called <em>Eugene</em> by Americans.”</p>

<p>Though the ink&#39;s still fresh on his compsci diploma, he&#39;s clearly prepared for the American press.</p>

<hr/>

<p><strong>What&#39;s the story behind the project? Do you remember the specific moment when you decided to do this?</strong></p>

<p>Many years ago, I had a friend that was really into federated networks when they were a new thing. That was when <a href="http://identi.ca/">identi.ca</a> was first created – at the very beginning of my developer knowledge and career.</p>

<p>A good portion of the stories written so far on his platform have framed it as an alternative to Twitter, which early Masto adopters refer to as “Hellbird,” or “the bird website.” Eugen isn&#39;t afraid to acknowledge his investment in the format.</p>

<p>I was a heavy Twitter user and I wasn&#39;t happy with where Twitter was going, so I decided to check on how the federated stuff was doing in the meantime. I found it in a very sad state, but thought I could contribute.</p>

<p>He began building on his own, with Tweetdeck&#39;s standard in mind.</p>

<blockquote><p>I thought &#39;if I&#39;m going to do something, it needs to have realtime updates and it needs to have columns.&#39; I started with a bare-bones prototype while still [at University] in May or April of last year. It had no user interface, only an API that I was using from the command line. And I thought &#39;okay, it works. that&#39;s great.&#39; Then, exams came.</p></blockquote>

<p>Academics had to come before the project at first, but it soon supplied an ample post-graduation diversion. He focused his energy on building something more complete and eventually launched a <a href="https://www.patreon.com/user?u=619786">Patreon page</a>.</p>

<blockquote><p>I <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=13303346">announced</a> it on HackerNews, and that was the first public release of the project. That&#39;s when I got my first users who weren&#39;t my friends, and some who were new to federated networks.</p></blockquote>

<p>That was just over 100 days ago, and it gave way to his first feedback.</p>

<blockquote><p>I started working on the first feature requests, shaping the project a bit differently. People were a lot more focused on privacy features than I thought they would be, although in retrospect, it makes sense. The previous [federated] project – GNU social – did not really have a focus on privacy features, or anything built in by default.</p></blockquote>

<p>It compelled him to change things, and his work was well received.</p>

<blockquote><p>Over time, I kept working on new features, and waves of new users came when it went viral in certain circles. The first was HackerNews and Product Hunt. <a href="https://twitter.com/aral">Aral Balkan</a> – a Twitter user with over 30,000 followers – picked up the project, gave it a shout out, and even did a giveaway of his app. He had a lot of followers from Holland; the Mastodon timelines became mostly Dutch.</p></blockquote>

<p>Next was Marxist anime Twitter (including <em><a href="http://mastodon.social/@extratone">Extratone</a></em> and <a href="http://bit.ly/dbmastodon">I</a>.)</p>

<p>Lots of furries; lots of LGBT people. That&#39;s when I really focused on privacy features and making sure all blocks worked because these individuals needed a safer platform than Twitter could offer.</p>

<p><img src="https://i.snap.as/0bAIHB6.png" alt="Sidekick dashboard background processing jobs as of Tuesday morning."/></p>

<p><em>Sidekick dashboard background processing jobs as of Tuesday morning.</em></p>

<p>“As you can see, the first bump is HackerNews, the second is Aral Balkan, and then anime/Marxist Twitter.”</p>

<p>And the last – now a bit out of date – is this week&#39;s spike, which is nearly double all previous waves.</p>

<p><strong>Are you responsible for all of the code?</strong></p>

<p>You can look at the <a href="https://github.com/tootsuite/mastodon">GitHub page</a> to see a specific breakdown of who contributed and how many lines of code, each. You&#39;ll see I&#39;m at the top by a large margin, but there are [additional] people who&#39;ve contributed interesting, good features &amp; fixes, localizations, user guides, and documentation.</p>

<p><strong>What&#39;s the story behind the name?</strong></p>

<p>It&#39;s not particularly interesting. I&#39;m a progressive metal fan, and I listen to <em>Mastodon</em> sometimes. They have a really cool name that refers to a really cool animal. It&#39;s a fluffy elephant! What&#39;s not to love?</p>

<p>It&#39;s also the inspiration for Mastodon&#39;s mascot, which was penned by Rochko&#39;s YouTuber friend <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/dopatwo">Dopatwo</a> after he realized how urgently he required an error page.</p>

<p><strong>What does “federated” mean to you?</strong></p>

<p>The biggest problem with this term is that it&#39;s new for lots of people. People who&#39;ve come across federated networks in the past<em>instantly</em> understand what it means and how it works, and people who are new to the concept have a lot of trouble before it clicks. But when Twitter first started, people didn&#39;t understand what &#39;retweeting&#39; meant, so it&#39;s not a unique problem domain.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know where it comes from – maybe BitTorrent – but people seem to think that when something is &#39;decentralized,&#39; everybody gets the same thing; that it&#39;s all synchronized one to one. In actuality, &#39;federated&#39; means that people in different instances can <em>talk</em> to each other, but the <em>content</em> is different depending on the users there, what they do, and who they follow.</p>

<p>Though instances are infrastructurally independent, they can communicate with one another. On a user level, timelines are still determined by who you do and do not follow across the entirety of all instances.</p>

<p><strong>What if Twitter comes to you in the near future with a job offer?</strong></p>

<p>[Rochko laughs.]</p>

<p>If it was any other company, I would think about it. A job is a staple source of income, and – depending on the company – could involve doing something important, but I have zero faith in Twitter.</p>

<p><strong>Does this all mean that I finally get to live out my serif Twitter dream?</strong></p>

<p>Yes, I suppose on your own instance, you could change the stylesheet...</p>

<p><strong>So if I set up my own instance and started charging for its use, I&#39;d be in the clear, legally?</strong></p>

<p>Yes, that&#39;s okay. The code is licensed under <a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.html">AGPL</a> version three, which I picked because other projects in the same space are using it. The difference between AGPL and GPL is that [the former] forces you to contribute back to the appstream code repository if you make any breaking changes.</p>

<p>For example, Eugen explained that WhatsApp originally used XMPP for its chat protocol, which meant that Facebook and Google Talk users could connect to it, too. However, the company progressively locked down the platform over time, leaving virtually nothing visible that was unique to XMPP in its current iteration.</p>

<p>To prevent somebody taking Mastodon code, placing it behind locks, and stripping out the federation part to make Twitter II, I&#39;m using this license.</p>

<p>The thing to remember about free software is that &#39;free&#39; means <em>freedom of the user,</em> not that it&#39;s zero cost. It&#39;s perfectly fine to charge for free software because developers need to live, too.</p>

<p><strong>I&#39;ve seen a lot of multilingual &#39;tooting&#39; these past few weeks. Can we expect an in-app translate function like Twitter&#39;s on Mastodon?</strong></p>

<p>I don&#39;t think I could put in a &#39;translate this toot&#39; button because APIs from Google and Bing are quite expensive at scale. I&#39;m not 100% promising this, but I can probably put something in where people can select which language they post in, and then just filter the timelines. That would at least solve the problem of being confronted with lots of French posts, without knowing any French.</p>

<p><strong>The only complaint about Twitter I remember that hasn&#39;t already been addressed here is the capability of editable &#39;toots.&#39; Is that a possibility?</strong></p>

<p>That won&#39;t happen. There&#39;s actually a good reason why they don&#39;t do that. It&#39;s simply because you could make a toot about one thing, have people favorite it and share it, link it from other places, and then suddenly, it says &#39;Heil Hitler,&#39; or something.</p>

<p><img src="https://i.snap.as/jrP0kLj.png" alt="Mastotile"/></p>

<p>It&#39;s a bit preposterous to continue the conversation as if Twitter and Mastodon are interchangeable entities. They exist in separate ideological and mechanical spheres, and will both continue to do so for a very long time.</p>

<p>That said, the fundamental user interface design and current cross-community user saturation <em>do</em> warrant comparisons between their functions. More likely than not, you&#39;ll create a Mastodon account because a link found you on Twitter, use it because you prefer its type of ecosystem, and you&#39;ll stay after realizing that nearly all of your age-old qualms have been addressed, if not already rectified. While <em>FOSS</em> and <em>Federated</em> may seem at times like jejune ideologies, their advantages are especially tangible in this context. Should you find yourself needing to complain about something, you&#39;ll find an audience. Perhaps it&#39;ll be your command line.</p>

<p>It&#39;s nothing but negligent to describe Mastodon as an <em>alternative</em> or <em>clone</em>.</p>

<p>It&#39;s more like Twitter&#39;s son.</p>

<p>It&#39;s leaner, quicker-to-change, much more flexible &amp; democratized, and less corrupt. Though I didn&#39;t ask its creator what he intended to gain from all his effort, I think his commitment itself denotes a preoccupation with progress. Those of you who&#39;ve been let down by the tools you&#39;ve been given to control your words&#39; exposure will find startling competence in your ability to determine per-toot privacy, or reserve your raucous photos and terrible memes from followers who are not necessarily complicit consumers. Naturally, it&#39;s also much less dependable, though a single instance outage will never leave you truly, completely silent. And the support will come.</p>

<p>It&#39;s been a privilege to be observer and participant in the first lightening of a new online community. In the moment, we enjoy our lavender haze -when the spaces are filling primarily with users who are sincerely interested enough in discourse to have sought it out.</p>

<p>Sarah Jeong&#39;s <a href="https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/mastodon-is-like-twitter-without-nazis-so-why-are-we-not-using-it">account</a> of her Twitter exile is a good, long read if you&#39;re craving more specifics, and Eugen&#39;s <a href="https://medium.com/@Gargron">Medium</a> offers a more complete explanation of federation and its place in the industry, straight from the source. Apparently, he&#39;s just as articulate with words as he is with code.</p>

<p>If I had to hazard a guess, I&#39;d bet it&#39;s <a href="https://usesthis.com/interviews/eugen.rochko/">not the last we&#39;ll hear from him</a>.</p>

<p><audio controls="">

</audio></p>

<p>Thanks to this week&#39;s September 2016 Keynote, we now know that iOS 10 will be officially released in just three days. I suppose it was a bit silly of me to download the <a href="http://www.imore.com/how-to-download-ios-10-public-beta">public beta</a> so late in the game, but I did, and regret it <em>much</em> less than I could&#39;ve imagined.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve used my rose gold iPhone 6S Plus more than any personal device I&#39;ve ever owned. For the first time in my functioning life, I&#39;ve had no persistent need for a laptop, which is a pretty big deal for reasons you couldn&#39;t care less about.</p>

<p>Ownership of my first generation iPhone trained me to dread new releases. Expectedly, it got less and less usable every time Stevie took the stage. For relevance&#39;s sake, I decided to opt in a bit early, despite my assumption that my 6S Plus would show its first signs of struggle as a result.</p>

<p>Immediately, though, the opposite effect was noticeable. Everything is faster: notifications, app opening/closing, intra-app function, and <em>text entry,</em> even. Smoother, too – so much so, it&#39;s almost a shame we&#39;ve had to use iOS 9 on these devices for a whole year. The effect of such smoothing on my perception should be kept in consideration when reading the rest of my opining.</p>

<p><strong>Raise to wake</strong> is less tedious/more useful than I anticipated, though it&#39;s been briefly mistriggered a few times in transit from inside my Moshi Overture Wallet Case (an extraordinary product, by the way,) but it should be noted that I walk and carry my phone rather strangely. With relatively default sleep/wake settings, I did not notice enough mistriggering to have quantifiable power consequences.</p>

<p><strong>Messages</strong> is appropriately-complex for the times, now, if that makes sense. The pressure to “compete” with Snapchat, Facebook Messenger, What&#39;sApp, etc. is understandable, but the execution of their reply is not. For me, at least, there is simply nothing to add to SMS. Its role is purely functional. I wasn&#39;t able to try out many of the new features. Not just because nobody else had iOS 10, but because – critically – I could not think of someone I&#39;d be willing to bother with useless garbage like... a doodle. And even if I could&#39;ve, it&#39;s probably actually <em>less</em> trouble to use one of those third-party applications in that Application Shop Apple has been so proud of for so long. For old people like me, even cleverly stowed buttons for unused features are <em>still buttons</em>. It feels an awful lot like an obligatory alteration, not a visionary one, and it&#39;s a shame that Apple&#39;s losing its awareness of the appropriate time for one, the other, or neither.</p>

<p>I feel like competence in coverage of Apple is heavily dependent upon the ability to differentiate between the allure of an intelligently blingy feature and the allure of an intelligently functional one. Crude, I know, but ever more essential. <strong>Contextual predictions</strong> are impressive and surprisingly-clever. It&#39;s encouraging to see progress in such simple interactions, but – be honest with yourself – making use of it is actually going to cost you time in the majority of cases. Hate to be excessively meta here, but keep in mind – again – that I am not the majority. I tend to type things out... It&#39;s my thing. If this is completely obscuring my vision of any of these features&#39; uselessness, <em>please</em> take the time to add to the discussion in the comments. Discourse is the handiest security in such matters.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve loved 3D Touch all along, even though something like 75% of the time, I&#39;ve been triggering it unintentionally. It&#39;s <em>very</em> useful for quickly grabbing web images, but I&#39;m probably more of a thief than you&#39;ll ever be. Mostly, I just like the sensation. The curt vibration and brittle illusion of a third interactive dimension have provided more functionality than... its actual functionality. With <strong>touch and go</strong>, though, I can instantly conjure a concise summary of the current local weather conditions, <em>and</em> a singular story from Apple News. Though I&#39;m undoubtedly going to need to make a conscious effort to remember to use them, anything&#39;s a plus when one&#39;s affection was already so irrational.</p>

<p>As to <strong>Apple News</strong> itself... It&#39;s just not the same application. The “For You” roll was amusingly messy before but actual structure (read: functional aggregation) has killed some of its beauty, I&#39;m afraid. It is <em>so</em> much faster, though. We&#39;ll actually have to take it seriously, now.</p>

<p>I haven&#39;t gotten the opportunity to really use <strong>rich notifications</strong> yet, but I can&#39;t imagine them <em>actually</em> making anything much faster. Perhaps singularly, I&#39;ve always found my unconscious navigation to a given application itself to be quick enough to consistently glance over “no, you don&#39;t have to leave the app” features.</p>

<p>I suspect the ability to <strong>search photos by content</strong> will be iOS 10&#39;s most useful addition for myself. A few trials demonstrate that it can differentiate between “nightfall” and “night,” and “clothed” and “nude.” (I have never been naked.) It&#39;s the most intriguing, too, because it means more nuanced &amp; controversial search parameters are just a few years away. Search by expression? Even search by <em>emotion.</em> I can&#39;t wait until Apple gets to wrestle with the perceived difference between peace and apathy within an algorithmic context.</p>

<p>“Please define &#39;joy,&#39; Mr. Ives.”</p>
