# [The Unlicense, Dave Edition](https://gist.github.com/extratone/140a11428b5dd1dda500b3928e0438b1)

Considering my use of Git as a means to track revisions on my own writing, it's important to note that you should feel free to replace all instances of "software" in the above statement with "words," "writing," "expression," etc.

While I appreciate tremendously the work and contribution of [Arlo Bendiken](https://ar.to/2010/01/set-your-code-free) in the form of The Unlicense, I would like to add that I see no need, personally, to make the refutation of Intellectual Property law regarding my own work into some profound ethical statement. As it stands, I have not to my knowledge been the victim of any sort of theft of any kind, and find the suggestion highly unlikely. If I *am*  made aware of such a case, there is certainly a possibility that I may change my mind on this issue, so I suppose I should highlight that **THESE TERMS ARE SUBJECT TO CHANGE**, though I suspect I would be more flattered and/or amused than actually offended. 

I would also like to annotate that my use of this license should not be regarded as a suggestion that anyone else follow my example, or that I "believe in" taking such action regarding one's work, generally. While I did indeed take the time to set up [a repository](https://github.com/extratone/eoi) of John Perry Barlow's "[The Economy of Ideas](https://www.wired.com/1994/03/economy-ideas/)" in a bunch of different document formats, I do not necessarily agree with all of what he argued, especially in the context of the world 27 years later. If you *are* particularly interested in my opinion on the matter for whatever reason, here is what I have to say to you:

The principled beginning of The Open Web was a great moment in history, but - like all historical principles - it is extremely important that we consider *context* and maintain an appropriate level of criticism when looking back on old manifestos written by old white guys. In general, try your best to *be reasonable*.

<h2 id="eugen-rochko-has-spent-this-year-perfecting-federated-social-media-in-mastodon-his-open-source-project-we-spoke-to-him-just-hours-before-it-became-a-global-tech-conversation">Eugen Rochko has spent this year perfecting federated social media in Mastodon – his open source project. We spoke to him just hours before it became a global tech conversation.</h2>

<p>The saga of Twitter, Inc. has been rejuvenated in 2017 by Tump&#39;s antics, corporate drama, and an amalgam of user and non-user disquiet with its decisions, though its financial viability has been in prominent industry conversation for half a decade. Since its pre-2010 outset, many &#39;a&#39; feature has accumulated on its original, still-iconic skeletal software, and – though the net is undoubtedly positive – a few have gone.</p>

<p>Last Thursday, the company revised in bravado its poultrian default profile picture and its system of replies to exclude @s on all of Twitter&#39;s proprietary services, drastically changing two of its visual mainstays, and prodding a particularly lucent cacophony. Turn your ear, and you&#39;ll hear many familiar terms in the chants: <em>limits, chains, strings, harassment, feedback, gamergate, nazis, etc.</em></p>

<p>These conversations are important, but they&#39;ve gotten awfully stale.</p>

<p>If you listen a bit more carefully, you&#39;ll intercept a new one:</p>

<p><em>Mastodon</em>.</p>

<p>It&#39;s the open source brainchild of Eugen Rochko, who&#39;s known colloquially as <a href="https://mastodon.social/@Gargron" rel="nofollow">Gargron</a>.</p>

<p>He&#39;s had one hell of a week.</p>

<p>Between the night of our first emails and our conversation, his flagship <a href="http://mastodon.social/" rel="nofollow">mastadon.social</a> instance had doubled in users. Less than two hours after we said our goodbyes, his name was on <em>The Verge</em>&#39;s front page.</p>

<p>Despite the urgency of it all, he graciously lent me his time just after breakfast on Tuesday to discuss himself and the story behind the project, while the most significant day of his life was building around him.</p>

<p>“I&#39;m perfectly fine with being called <em>Eugene</em> by Americans.”</p>

<p>Though the ink&#39;s still fresh on his compsci diploma, he&#39;s clearly prepared for the American press.</p>

<hr/>

<p><strong>What&#39;s the story behind the project? Do you remember the specific moment when you decided to do this?</strong></p>

<p>Many years ago, I had a friend that was really into federated networks when they were a new thing. That was when <a href="http://identi.ca/" rel="nofollow">identi.ca</a> was first created – at the very beginning of my developer knowledge and career.</p>

<p>A good portion of the stories written so far on his platform have framed it as an alternative to Twitter, which early Masto adopters refer to as “Hellbird,” or “the bird website.” Eugen isn&#39;t afraid to acknowledge his investment in the format.</p>

<p>I was a heavy Twitter user and I wasn&#39;t happy with where Twitter was going, so I decided to check on how the federated stuff was doing in the meantime. I found it in a very sad state, but thought I could contribute.</p>

<p>He began building on his own, with Tweetdeck&#39;s standard in mind.</p>

<blockquote><p>I thought &#39;if I&#39;m going to do something, it needs to have realtime updates and it needs to have columns.&#39; I started with a bare-bones prototype while still [at University] in May or April of last year. It had no user interface, only an API that I was using from the command line. And I thought &#39;okay, it works. that&#39;s great.&#39; Then, exams came.</p></blockquote>

<p>Academics had to come before the project at first, but it soon supplied an ample post-graduation diversion. He focused his energy on building something more complete and eventually launched a <a href="https://www.patreon.com/user?u=619786" rel="nofollow">Patreon page</a>.</p>

<blockquote><p>I <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=13303346" rel="nofollow">announced</a> it on HackerNews, and that was the first public release of the project. That&#39;s when I got my first users who weren&#39;t my friends, and some who were new to federated networks.</p></blockquote>

<p>That was just over 100 days ago, and it gave way to his first feedback.</p>

<blockquote><p>I started working on the first feature requests, shaping the project a bit differently. People were a lot more focused on privacy features than I thought they would be, although in retrospect, it makes sense. The previous [federated] project – GNU social – did not really have a focus on privacy features, or anything built in by default.</p></blockquote>

<p>It compelled him to change things, and his work was well received.</p>

<blockquote><p>Over time, I kept working on new features, and waves of new users came when it went viral in certain circles. The first was HackerNews and Product Hunt. <a href="https://twitter.com/aral" rel="nofollow">Aral Balkan</a> – a Twitter user with over 30,000 followers – picked up the project, gave it a shout out, and even did a giveaway of his app. He had a lot of followers from Holland; the Mastodon timelines became mostly Dutch.</p></blockquote>

<p>Next was Marxist anime Twitter (including <em><a href="http://mastodon.social/@extratone" rel="nofollow">Extratone</a></em> and <a href="http://bit.ly/dbmastodon" rel="nofollow">I</a>.)</p>

<p>Lots of furries; lots of LGBT people. That&#39;s when I really focused on privacy features and making sure all blocks worked because these individuals needed a safer platform than Twitter could offer.</p>

<p><img src="https://i.snap.as/0bAIHB6.png" alt="Sidekick dashboard background processing jobs as of Tuesday morning."/></p>

<p><em>Sidekick dashboard background processing jobs as of Tuesday morning.</em></p>

<p>“As you can see, the first bump is HackerNews, the second is Aral Balkan, and then anime/Marxist Twitter.”</p>

<p>And the last – now a bit out of date – is this week&#39;s spike, which is nearly double all previous waves.</p>

<p><strong>Are you responsible for all of the code?</strong></p>

<p>You can look at the <a href="https://github.com/tootsuite/mastodon" rel="nofollow">GitHub page</a> to see a specific breakdown of who contributed and how many lines of code, each. You&#39;ll see I&#39;m at the top by a large margin, but there are [additional] people who&#39;ve contributed interesting, good features &amp; fixes, localizations, user guides, and documentation.</p>

<p><strong>What&#39;s the story behind the name?</strong></p>

<p>It&#39;s not particularly interesting. I&#39;m a progressive metal fan, and I listen to <em>Mastodon</em> sometimes. They have a really cool name that refers to a really cool animal. It&#39;s a fluffy elephant! What&#39;s not to love?</p>

<p>It&#39;s also the inspiration for Mastodon&#39;s mascot, which was penned by Rochko&#39;s YouTuber friend <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/dopatwo" rel="nofollow">Dopatwo</a> after he realized how urgently he required an error page.</p>

<p><strong>What does “federated” mean to you?</strong></p>

<p>The biggest problem with this term is that it&#39;s new for lots of people. People who&#39;ve come across federated networks in the past<em>instantly</em> understand what it means and how it works, and people who are new to the concept have a lot of trouble before it clicks. But when Twitter first started, people didn&#39;t understand what &#39;retweeting&#39; meant, so it&#39;s not a unique problem domain.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know where it comes from – maybe BitTorrent – but people seem to think that when something is &#39;decentralized,&#39; everybody gets the same thing; that it&#39;s all synchronized one to one. In actuality, &#39;federated&#39; means that people in different instances can <em>talk</em> to each other, but the <em>content</em> is different depending on the users there, what they do, and who they follow.</p>

<p>Though instances are infrastructurally independent, they can communicate with one another. On a user level, timelines are still determined by who you do and do not follow across the entirety of all instances.</p>

<p><strong>What if Twitter comes to you in the near future with a job offer?</strong></p>

<p>[Rochko laughs.]</p>

<p>If it was any other company, I would think about it. A job is a staple source of income, and – depending on the company – could involve doing something important, but I have zero faith in Twitter.</p>

<p><strong>Does this all mean that I finally get to live out my serif Twitter dream?</strong></p>

<p>Yes, I suppose on your own instance, you could change the stylesheet...</p>

<p><strong>So if I set up my own instance and started charging for its use, I&#39;d be in the clear, legally?</strong></p>

<p>Yes, that&#39;s okay. The code is licensed under <a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.html" rel="nofollow">AGPL</a> version three, which I picked because other projects in the same space are using it. The difference between AGPL and GPL is that [the former] forces you to contribute back to the appstream code repository if you make any breaking changes.</p>

<p>For example, Eugen explained that WhatsApp originally used XMPP for its chat protocol, which meant that Facebook and Google Talk users could connect to it, too. However, the company progressively locked down the platform over time, leaving virtually nothing visible that was unique to XMPP in its current iteration.</p>

<p>To prevent somebody taking Mastodon code, placing it behind locks, and stripping out the federation part to make Twitter II, I&#39;m using this license.</p>

<p>The thing to remember about free software is that &#39;free&#39; means <em>freedom of the user,</em> not that it&#39;s zero cost. It&#39;s perfectly fine to charge for free software because developers need to live, too.</p>

<p><strong>I&#39;ve seen a lot of multilingual &#39;tooting&#39; these past few weeks. Can we expect an in-app translate function like Twitter&#39;s on Mastodon?</strong></p>

<p>I don&#39;t think I could put in a &#39;translate this toot&#39; button because APIs from Google and Bing are quite expensive at scale. I&#39;m not 100% promising this, but I can probably put something in where people can select which language they post in, and then just filter the timelines. That would at least solve the problem of being confronted with lots of French posts, without knowing any French.</p>

<p><strong>The only complaint about Twitter I remember that hasn&#39;t already been addressed here is the capability of editable &#39;toots.&#39; Is that a possibility?</strong></p>

<p>That won&#39;t happen. There&#39;s actually a good reason why they don&#39;t do that. It&#39;s simply because you could make a toot about one thing, have people favorite it and share it, link it from other places, and then suddenly, it says &#39;Heil Hitler,&#39; or something.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a bit preposterous to continue the conversation as if Twitter and Mastodon are interchangeable entities. They exist in separate ideological and mechanical spheres, and will both continue to do so for a very long time.</p>

<p>That said, the fundamental user interface design and current cross-community user saturation <em>do</em> warrant comparisons between their functions. More likely than not, you&#39;ll create a Mastodon account because a link found you on Twitter, use it because you prefer its type of ecosystem, and you&#39;ll stay after realizing that nearly all of your age-old qualms have been addressed, if not already rectified. While <em>FOSS</em> and <em>Federated</em> may seem at times like jejune ideologies, their advantages are especially tangible in this context. Should you find yourself needing to complain about something, you&#39;ll find an audience. Perhaps it&#39;ll be your command line.</p>

<p>It&#39;s nothing but negligent to describe Mastodon as an <em>alternative</em> or <em>clone</em>.</p>

<p>It&#39;s more like Twitter&#39;s son.</p>

<p>It&#39;s leaner, quicker-to-change, much more flexible &amp; democratized, and less corrupt. Though I didn&#39;t ask its creator what he intended to gain from all his effort, I think his commitment itself denotes a preoccupation with progress. Those of you who&#39;ve been let down by the tools you&#39;ve been given to control your words&#39; exposure will find startling competence in your ability to determine per-toot privacy, or reserve your raucous photos and terrible memes from followers who are not necessarily complicit consumers. Naturally, it&#39;s also much less dependable, though a single instance outage will never leave you truly, completely silent. And the support will come.</p>

<p>It&#39;s been a privilege to be observer and participant in the first lightening of a new online community. In the moment, we enjoy our lavender haze -when the spaces are filling primarily with users who are sincerely interested enough in discourse to have sought it out.</p>

<p>Sarah Jeong&#39;s <a href="https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/mastodon-is-like-twitter-without-nazis-so-why-are-we-not-using-it" rel="nofollow">account</a> of her Twitter exile is a good, long read if you&#39;re craving more specifics, and Eugen&#39;s <a href="https://medium.com/@Gargron" rel="nofollow">Medium</a> offers a more complete explanation of federation and its place in the industry, straight from the source. Apparently, he&#39;s just as articulate with words as he is with code.</p>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="book e-content"><h2 id="big-boy-big-phone-still-in-effect-words-on-next-tuesday-s-update-from-a-withering-old-man">Big Boy; Big Phone still in effect, words on next Tuesday&#39;s update from a withering old man.</h2>

<p>Thanks to this week&#39;s September 2016 Keynote, we now know that iOS 10 will be officially released in just three days. I suppose it was a bit silly of me to download the <a href="http://www.imore.com/how-to-download-ios-10-public-beta" rel="nofollow">public beta</a> so late in the game, but I did, and regret it <em>much</em> less than I could&#39;ve imagined.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve used my rose gold iPhone 6S Plus more than any personal device I&#39;ve ever owned. For the first time in my functioning life, I&#39;ve had no persistent need for a laptop, which is a pretty big deal for reasons you couldn&#39;t care less about.</p>

<p>Ownership of my first generation iPhone trained me to dread new releases. Expectedly, it got less and less usable every time Stevie took the stage. For relevance&#39;s sake, I decided to opt in a bit early, despite my assumption that my 6S Plus would show its first signs of struggle as a result.</p>

<p>Immediately, though, the opposite effect was noticeable. Everything is faster: notifications, app opening/closing, intra-app function, and <em>text entry,</em> even. Smoother, too – so much so, it&#39;s almost a shame we&#39;ve had to use iOS 9 on these devices for a whole year. The effect of such smoothing on my perception should be kept in consideration when reading the rest of my opining.</p>

<p><strong>Raise to wake</strong> is less tedious/more useful than I anticipated, though it&#39;s been briefly mistriggered a few times in transit from inside my Moshi Overture Wallet Case (an extraordinary product, by the way,) but it should be noted that I walk and carry my phone rather strangely. With relatively default sleep/wake settings, I did not notice enough mistriggering to have quantifiable power consequences.</p>

<p><strong>Messages</strong> is appropriately-complex for the times, now, if that makes sense. The pressure to “compete” with Snapchat, Facebook Messenger, What&#39;sApp, etc. is understandable, but the execution of their reply is not. For me, at least, there is simply nothing to add to SMS. Its role is purely functional. I wasn&#39;t able to try out many of the new features. Not just because nobody else had iOS 10, but because – critically – I could not think of someone I&#39;d be willing to bother with useless garbage like... a doodle. And even if I could&#39;ve, it&#39;s probably actually <em>less</em> trouble to use one of those third-party applications in that Application Shop Apple has been so proud of for so long. For old people like me, even cleverly stowed buttons for unused features are <em>still buttons</em>. It feels an awful lot like an obligatory alteration, not a visionary one, and it&#39;s a shame that Apple&#39;s losing its awareness of the appropriate time for one, the other, or neither.</p>

<p>I feel like competence in coverage of Apple is heavily dependent upon the ability to differentiate between the allure of an intelligently blingy feature and the allure of an intelligently functional one. Crude, I know, but ever more essential. <strong>Contextual predictions</strong> are impressive and surprisingly-clever. It&#39;s encouraging to see progress in such simple interactions, but – be honest with yourself – making use of it is actually going to cost you time in the majority of cases. Hate to be excessively meta here, but keep in mind – again – that I am not the majority. I tend to type things out... It&#39;s my thing. If this is completely obscuring my vision of any of these features&#39; uselessness, <em>please</em> take the time to add to the discussion in the comments. Discourse is the handiest security in such matters.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve loved 3D Touch all along, even though something like 75% of the time, I&#39;ve been triggering it unintentionally. It&#39;s <em>very</em> useful for quickly grabbing web images, but I&#39;m probably more of a thief than you&#39;ll ever be. Mostly, I just like the sensation. The curt vibration and brittle illusion of a third interactive dimension have provided more functionality than... its actual functionality. With <strong>touch and go</strong>, though, I can instantly conjure a concise summary of the current local weather conditions, <em>and</em> a singular story from Apple News. Though I&#39;m undoubtedly going to need to make a conscious effort to remember to use them, anything&#39;s a plus when one&#39;s affection was already so irrational.</p>

<p>As to <strong>Apple News</strong> itself... It&#39;s just not the same application. The “For You” roll was amusingly messy before but actual structure (read: functional aggregation) has killed some of its beauty, I&#39;m afraid. It is <em>so</em> much faster, though. We&#39;ll actually have to take it seriously, now.</p>

<p>I haven&#39;t gotten the opportunity to really use <strong>rich notifications</strong> yet, but I can&#39;t imagine them <em>actually</em> making anything much faster. Perhaps singularly, I&#39;ve always found my unconscious navigation to a given application itself to be quick enough to consistently glance over “no, you don&#39;t have to leave the app” features.</p>

<p>I suspect the ability to <strong>search photos by content</strong> will be iOS 10&#39;s most useful addition for myself. A few trials demonstrate that it can differentiate between “nightfall” and “night,” and “clothed” and “nude.” (I have never been naked.) It&#39;s the most intriguing, too, because it means more nuanced &amp; controversial search parameters are just a few years away. Search by expression? Even search by <em>emotion.</em> I can&#39;t wait until Apple gets to wrestle with the perceived difference between peace and apathy within an algorithmic context.</p>

<p>“Please define &#39;joy,&#39; Mr. Ives.”</p>
