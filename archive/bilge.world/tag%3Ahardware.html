Considering my use of Git as a means to track revisions on my own writing, it's important to note that you should feel free to replace all instances of "software" in the above statement with "words," "writing," "expression," etc.

While I appreciate tremendously the work and contribution of [Arlo Bendiken](https://ar.to/2010/01/set-your-code-free) in the form of The Unlicense, I would like to add that I see no need, personally, to make the refutation of Intellectual Property law regarding my own work into some profound ethical statement. As it stands, I have not to my knowledge been the victim of any sort of theft of any kind, and find the suggestion highly unlikely. If I *am*  made aware of such a case, there is certainly a possibility that I may change my mind on this issue, so I suppose I should highlight that **THESE TERMS ARE SUBJECT TO CHANGE**, though I suspect I would be more flattered and/or amused than actually offended. 

I would also like to annotate that my use of this license should not be regarded as a suggestion that anyone else follow my example, or that I "believe in" taking such action regarding one's work, generally. While I did indeed take the time to set up [a repository](https://github.com/extratone/eoi) of John Perry Barlow's "[The Economy of Ideas](https://www.wired.com/1994/03/economy-ideas/)" in a bunch of different document formats, I do not necessarily agree with all of what he argued, especially in the context of the world 27 years later. If you *are* particularly interested in my opinion on the matter for whatever reason, here is what I have to say to you:

The principled beginning of The Open Web was a great moment in history, but - like all historical principles - it is extremely important that we consider *context* and maintain an appropriate level of criticism when looking back on old manifestos written by old white guys. In general, try your best to *be reasonable*.

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="book e-content"><p><img src="https://i.snap.as/Ck4ECB9t.jpeg" alt="Varmilo VA108M"/></p>

<p>Yes, I bought a mechanical keyboard. It occurred to me that folks who spend a lot of time doing things that require tools – <em>professionals</em>, artisans, craftsmen, etc. – usually seek out the best possible quality offerings of those tools. Even if they&#39;re just 5% better than the average alternatives and cost twice as much, when one uses them for hours every day, the last bit of refinement pays off very quickly. Considering how much typing I&#39;ve done in the past 5-10 years, I find it a bit silly that I hadn&#39;t before thought to optimize the hardware I&#39;ve used to do so. Now that I&#39;ve put at least some thought into designing the space in which I work and <a href="https://www.davidblue.wtf/college-return/">gone back to school</a>, I&#39;ve also invested in bettering the thing my hands actually touch the most.</p>

<h5 id="actually-before-i-go-on-here-is-the-link-https-documentcloud-adobe-com-link-review-uri-urn-aaid-scds-us-497d6e70-60df-4087-a3e5-af91077bec15https-documentcloud-adobe-com-link-review-uri-urn-aaid-scds-us-497d6e70-60df-4087-a3e5-af91077bec15-to-the-varmilo-va108m-user-manual-guide-reference-in-english-in-case-that-s-what-you-came-looking-for-i-had-difficulty-finding-it-too">Actually... Before I go on, <a href="https://documentcloud.adobe.com/link/review?uri=urn%3Aaaid%3Ascds%3AUS%3A497d6e70-60df-4087-a3e5-af91077bec15https%3A%2F%2Fdocumentcloud.adobe.com%2Flink%2Freview%3Furi%3Durn%3Aaaid%3Ascds%3AUS%3A497d6e70-60df-4087-a3e5-af91077bec15">here is the link</a> to the Varmilo VA108M User Manual/Guide/Reference in English in case that&#39;s what you came looking for. (I had difficulty finding it, too.)</h5>

<p>I suppose I&#39;ve let myself be blinded to the advantages of a mechanical keyboard by the <em>gaemer</em> stigma that surrounds them. This time, I believe I began by simply inputting something like “best keyboard for typing” into a search engine, which returns plenty of iffy results, naturally, but among them was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/our-favorite-mechanical-keyboards/">a list from <em>Wirecutter</em></a> – whom I trust, more or less – of “Best Mechanical Keyboards 2020.” Also included were posts in the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/">r/MechanicalKeyboards subreddit</a>, which I <em>actually fucking joined</em>[^1] (but promise never to mention again outside of this post.) Uncovering my eyes, I found a ridiculously-extensive community message board and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/wiki">Wiki</a>, which is undoubtedly the most extensive resource on the subject to be found, anywhere. Though I did place a time limit on myself for any research of 15 minutes, in retrospect, I suppose I also had some criteria, which I assume – if you&#39;re still reading – you might be interested in:</p>
<ul><li><strong>WIRED</strong> as fuck. Bluetooth can <em>fuck off</em>.</li>
<li>“Full” keyboard, for the same reason I&#39;d never spend any money on a piano with any less than 88 keys.</li>
<li>At least tolerably tasteful, aesthetically. (Not overwhelmingly embarrassing if someone were to actually see me using it.)</li>
<li>Cute, ideally.</li>
<li>No light shows.</li>
<li>Not “ergonomic.”</li>
<li>Not from Logitech or Microsoft.</li></ul>

<p>Immediately, it was overwhelmingly clear that my choice must also have <em>The Cherry</em>... The Cherries... The “Cherry MX Switches,” whatever they are. <em>Any</em> of even the most skimmy reading up on the subject will lead you to this conclusion. That addressed, I arrived upon three considerations: the <a href="https://www.duckychannel.com.tw/en/Ducky-One2-RGB-TKL">Ducky One 2</a>, <a href="https://www.daskeyboard.com/model-s-professional/">Das Keyboard Model S Professional</a>, and <a href="http://blog.piaw.net/2017/12/review-varmilo-va87m-wired-keyboard.html">Varmilo VA87M</a>.</p>

<p><img src="https://i.snap.as/Tef4WBLJ.jpg" alt="Varmilo VA108M (Overhead)"/></p>

<p><em>Layout of the VA108M seen from above.</em></p>

<p>As good as the idea of something as German as the Das Keyboard sounded, I hate the way it looks, and the Ducky seemed to take itself too seriously (despite its brand name.) The VA87M seemed to be ideal if it was full-sized. I searched for the equivalent, <a href="http://mechanicalkeyboards.com/shop/index.php?l=product_detail&p=2855">found the VA108M</a>, and bought one immediately. Specifically...</p>

<p>I&#39;ve already written more than I ever wanted to, but let me just say that I love everything about the thing – the particular set of special keys, the way it feels &amp; sounds, and that its heft prevents it from moving around – and I hope to keep it forever. As I said on the photographs I posted to social media, <strong>I promise to never bring this or any other mechanical keyboard up ever again</strong> unless asked about it.</p>

<p>[1] Yes, I have actually been using the Read It website in the past 18 months or so, which anyone who’s known me at all would find unbelievable. I don’t know if I’ll write about it in the future, so I’ll just say I’ve unblocked it within my psyche largely because it’s no longer horrendous to look at.</p>

<p>[2] I remain genuinely confused as to why the color of the switches matters, considering they are only visible when the keycaps have been removed.</p>

<h2 id="i-bought-a-desktop-tower-for-the-first-time-since-2010-and-spent-an-embarrassingly-long-time-struggling-with-bluetooth-shit">I bought a desktop tower for the first time since 2010 and spent an embarrassingly long time struggling with Bluetooth shit.</h2>

<p>As with my <a href="hp-spectre-x360-review.html">entire history</a> of computer purchases, my acquisition of an <a href="https://support.hp.com/us-en/document/c06443577">HP ENVY Desktop tower</a>, today, was last-minute, ill-informed, and certainly irrational. You “PC master race” folk: please spare me the <em>dude, you could&#39;ve just built your own pc so much cheaper</em> shit.[^1] Yes, I realize the sensible course of action would&#39;ve begun with a two hour trip West to the closest Microcenter, where I&#39;m sure the staff would&#39;ve made PC shopping an absolute blast and I would&#39;ve come away with a more powerful, much cheaper machine. However, after I managed to <a href="https://www.davidblue.wtf/finally-broke-windows/">break Windows</a> on my only machine this weekend (and subsequently failed to reset it,) I was getting especially behind on schoolwork and had <em>absolutely no desire</em> to complete any of it on my iPhone.</p>

<p>And so... I&#39;ve just returned from picking up said HP Tower along with a <a href="https://store.hp.com/us/en/pdp/hp-27f-27-inch-display#!">27” HP LED display</a>, and am writing you after having set up the machine physically and installed most of my “essential software” list (at least all that I could remember.) As per my favorite tradition of new computer acquisition, I have named the machine after <a href="https://fortitude.fandom.com/wiki/Hildur_Odegard">Hildur Odegard</a> from <em>Fortitude</em>.</p>

<p>It&#39;s been exactly 10 years since I last bought a desktop tower – since I first set hands on the Dell XPS Studio desktop with which I would create the majority of my intellectual property – and I was immediately surprised by how much smaller (6.12 x 11.93 x 13.28 inches) and lighter (13.12 lbs.) this tower was than my expectations. The display, too, is remarkably light and thin. Rationally, I should not have been surprised by this, but I&#39;m not going to punish myself for continuing to find any sort of magic in technology.</p>

<p>In the box were a Bluetooth keyboard – specifically, an HP model <a href="https://fccid.io/EMJKHSA-P003K">4251a-khsap003k</a> – and mouse set, the latter of which I will hopefully never have to use, thanks to my <a href="https://youtu.be/oIAY1-aW8Es">Logitech G203</a> – and was perplexed by the process of how to pair the former with the tower while it was in setup mode for far too long. I was just about to give up entirely when I revisited the packaging and noticed what I&#39;d previously assumed was an anti-theft device, but was actually the fucking dongle for the pair. I continue to despise Bluetooth peripherals, obviously, but the multimedia function keys of the product led to some important realizations: I now had reason to use Windows Desktop Switching <em>and</em> have a calculator application again! However, I have yet to figure out how to alter the Function key&#39;s behavior (I&#39;m not even sure it&#39;s possible:) in order to input <strong>Alt+F4</strong>, I have to input <strong>Fn+Alt+F4</strong>, which is far too clunky to depend on. The issue did lead to a revelation which I may or may not integrate permanently: I mapped <strong>Alt+F4</strong> to the previously-unused button on the very top of the G203. So far, it&#39;s been pretty nifty.</p>

<p><em>The HP 4251a-khsap003k included in the box with my new HP desktop.</em></p>

<p>That said, a component of my intention to create an intentional, static, upright-sitting desktop workspace included an allotment for a quality mechanical keyboard – my justification was that any professional in a particular craft makes a point to have the best possible tools for the job, so a high-quality keyboard has actually been <em>very</em> long overdue, in my case. So, I sought out <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/our-favorite-mechanical-keyboards/">a single <em>Wirecutter</em> recommendations list</a> and even attempted to disseminate <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/">r/MechanicalKeyboards</a>.[^2] After a brief jaunt, I concluded that no reasonable person would be able to make heads or tails of the forum or <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/wiki/index">its seemingly endless wikis</a> without considerable indoctrination so I more or less threw a dart and landed on the <a href="https://mechanicalkeyboards.com/shop/index.php?l=product_detail&p=3504">Varmilo VA108M</a>, which I ordered. All I know is that it&#39;s fairly highly-reviewed on the marketplaces I checked (though hardly mentioned on the subreddit, actually,) and that it has the <em>Cherry Switches</em>, which are... <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/comments/d3hmw3/my_new_baby_varmilo_108m_cherry_mx_blues_the/">The good ones</a>.</p>

<p>A concern I originally had with taking over the tertiary guest room – by far the smallest allotted living space in the house – as my office was its distance from our wireless router, two floors down. The last time I used the room as a workspace (five years ago,) my old tower&#39;s integrated WiFi card often struggled to maintain a reliable connection. The adapter included in this desktop, though, actually managed to clock <a href="https://www.speedtest.net/result/10021332678">the fastest download speed on my SpeedTest.net records</a> just now.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.speedtest.net/result/10021332678.png" alt="SpeedTest Results"/></p>

<p>Somehow, I just managed to clock the <a href="https://www.speedtest.net/result/10021332678">highest download speed on my record</a> from two floors up!</p>

<h2 id="bad-ish">Bad(ish)</h2>

<p>It&#39;s almost painful even to write this but... As beautiful as this $250 display is to behold, I&#39;ve grown accustomed to my <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/surface/business/surface-laptop-2">Surface Laptop 2</a>&#39;s <strong>2256 x 1504 13”</strong> display after years of hard, daily use. Apparently, those dimensions mean the little machine&#39;s display has a pixel density of <strong>201 Pixels-Per-Inch</strong>. Filling a <strong>27”</strong> display with just <strong>1920 x 1080</strong> means a pixel density of just <strong>81.6 Pixels-Per-Inch</strong>,[^3] and the disparity was glaring to my eyes, even from the setup screen. After a few hours of regular use, I&#39;m not sure I notice it anymore, but I suspect I will again when I&#39;ve got the laptop running again. Please do indicate whether or not you think such a complaint makes me awful in the <a href="https://poll.fm/10603399">Crowdsignal poll</a> below.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve also already had trouble connecting my <a href="https://www.bose.com/en_us/support/products/bose_headphones_support/bose_around_ear_headphones_support/soundlink-around-ear-wireless-headphones-ii.html">Bose SoundLink headphones</a> correctly via Bluetooth.

For whatever reason, I have been unable to accomplish such a simultaneous connection on this machine: I can either connect them as headphones or as a headset, but not both. <a href="https://youtu.be/55yn-zF_dZY">This video</a> provided some help – I know now that I have to open Sound Settings and manually connect the headphones every time I re-connect them.

<p>Returning to the webcam issue: I discovered that absolutely <em>zero</em> local stores keep add-on webcams in stock anymore, which makes sense. I resorted to searching Amazon for webcams and found a gargantuan list of brands I had never heard of. When I filtered by the one I <em>did</em> recognize – Logitech – I saw barely-facelifted versions of the camera my stepdad bought in 2008 and none were in stock. Unwilling to further investigate or research more, I set the price filter for under $40, sorted by customer ratings, and bought the first product which had even remotely legitimate-looking reviews: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08BQZT4N8/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1">this 1080p <em>thing</em></a> branded with “Mersuii.”</p>

<p>After returning to the order invoice hours later for this post, I got curious enough to Google search the company name and discovered a dead-end url, zero Wikipedia page, and <a href="https://trademarks.justia.com/863/53/mersuii-86353116.html">this Trademark registration</a>, on which I spotted some very interesting information.

<p>Assuming Jesus Christ is in your thoughts this evening before yet another anniversary of his birth, I am infinitely astonished by the truth in what I’m about to suppose with you. If the Son of God was living today, most of us have agreed for a long time now that he’d use marijuana recreationally – big fuckin whoop. I think it’s far more interesting and appropriate (we all know his birthday was <a href="https://www.thisamericanlife.org/47/christmas-and-commerce">wholly reconfigured into a consumerist holiday</a> long ago) to speculate on how he’d behave after finding himself inadvertently in the market for a new laptop within the ~$1000 range (following a <em>stubbed toe whilst walking on water</em> incident, perhaps.) Surely, it would not be entirely holy for him to opt in to the Foxconn-complicit world of Apple, Incorporated, nor the <a href="google-soul-ledger-dont-be-evil.html">openly-blasphemous</a> one created and exuberantly grown by Google LLC, and I’m afraid he’d be too much of an <em>End User</em> idiot to integrate any of the sparse Linux-dedicated hardware available. In May of 2017, however, Billy Gates’ old Microsoft finally released “<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/5/5/15557738/vergecast-podcast-255-microsoft-surface-laptop-samsung-dex-i-clicked-the-doc">the laptop we’ve always wanted them to make</a>,” but could its recent update be truly worthy of our Lourde and Saviour? Or your newly-enrolled offspring? Should you sprint downstairs and swap out the new MacBook Air you just bought?</p>

<iframe height="185" frameborder="0" src="https://embed.radiopublic.com/e?if=end-user-WdbezM&amp;ge=s1!fb997569626371bb19366d2dc0e4a0be2793e9b4"></iframe>

<p>From an entirely valid perspective, an observer might declare my last two months of 2018 to be an outright shameful period defined by hypocrisy and traitorous betrayals. After finally taking the time to explore the full narrative surrounding Linux and the bloody tale of Microsoft’s cruel genocidal destruction of countless creative software projects throughout computing’s adolescence (see: “<a href="https://youtu.be/TVHcdgrqbHE?t=425">Embrace, Extend, Extinguish</a>,”) I eventually declared myself “100% Open Source” and began outlining an essay designed primarily to express that <em>Linux is finally ready to be the operating system of the people</em> without succumbing immediately to the brand of cybercrackpot illegitimacy associated with the L-word in the minds of the general public so readily thanks to decades of misinformed, condescending neckbeards. Such a feat would require entire new planes of cultural awareness and dialectal delicacy, yet certainly result in zero personal reward from even the best possible outcome, yet I proceeded to ponder the subject very deliberately all the way through October because I genuinely believed in a new democratized future of computing. 2018 had been my Grand Awakening to the idyllic possibilities of Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) across the whole applied spectrum from office suites to <a href="federated/index.html">social networks</a>, yet – as two thousand eighteen comes to an end – I’ve managed to find myself among the most <a href="https://youtu.be/O0RSeFcv3Qs">jaded, soul-sapped</a> tech community I have yet encountered: <strong>Microsoft Administrators</strong>.</p>

<p>Complimenting this Linux-laden culture in which I was not so long ago deeply embedded was a confused and frustrated outlook regarding what I felt were excessive and completely idiotic sacrifices across the industry’s hardware design to the greedy, gluttonous god of Lightness. It seemed only reasonable to Myself As Consumer that the entire buying public should exclusively seek designs prioritizing greatest possible performance and battery life, even from portable computers and smartphones, so I assumed my perspective on this updated iteration of Microsoft&#39;s most laptopy Surface laptop – which exists in large part to <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/364728/spec-down-apple-macbook-air-vs-microsoft-surface-laptop-2">compete directly with</a> Apple&#39;s beloved (and just-updated) MacBook Air – wouldn&#39;t be at all useful. However, a few weeks ago, my employer prompted me with a sweet sweet ultimatum: <em>for the sake of a tax break, I want to spend ~$1000 on a laptop for you as soon as possible</em>. Yes, I know I should consider myself a very fortunate man – this <a href="hp-spectre-x360-review.html">wasn&#39;t even the first time</a> I&#39;d been surprised with the “hey, I want to buy you a laptop but it has to be today” experience, and may even be considered a sort of sequel to my <em>Tales of Whirlwind Manic Consumerism</em>, but it’s ultimately one of the most idiotic strategies to achieve a major purchase decision and completely inadvisable for anyone on a budget. Still I was indeed thankful to be put in a nearly-identical situation of Consumer Electronic haste, and have come to be especially appreciative of the specific time I was approached as such: just one week after <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/16/17979516/microsoft-surface-laptop-2-review-specs-price-features-windows-10">Microsoft launched the Surface Laptop 2</a>.</p>

<p>Considering the vast majority of its users are <a href="https://theoutline.com/post/2923/the-popularity-of-microsoft-surface-is-the-least-realistic-thing-on-television">trapped inside my television</a>, there’s no harm in covering the Surface brand with our virtual palm for a moment. If you’ll indulge me so, you’ll notice that Microsoft has actually delivered unto us <strong>The Laptop II</strong> – as in, the sequel... the <em>successor</em> to <em>every other laptop computer</em> yet conceived... but does this one machine truly represent the second coming of the <em>Notebook Christ</em>? Naturally, it would be a bit zealous to stand behind this extreme statement with 100% sincerity, but there truly <em>are</em> certain elements of this Personal Computing product&#39;s execution which do indeed will its user to expect and/or desire from others in coming years. As I&#39;ve stated before, I also simply cannot help but be jazzed by such bravado from the mouths of even a company with as crooked and hateful history as Microsoft&#39;s. (Note: no other technology company has actually achieved what Microsoft historically has in this regard, and hopefully none ever will again.)</p>

<p>I must be honest: it hasn&#39;t yet been two months and I&#39;ve already scuffed and perhaps even <em>stained</em> the beautiful maroon alcantara surrounding my machine’s touchable body, but it’s occurred to me that I might draw upon the vast library of <a href="https://youtu.be/PM-FbFIBoCs">automotive interior tutorials</a> available on YouTube – and even purchase some of the alcantara care-specific products they recommend – in order to <em>really</em> maintain the exterior of the Laptop II. After all, <a href="https://www.popularmechanics.com/cars/a9653/what-is-alcantara/">alcantara was undeniably car culture’s material first</a>. I should also confess that objectively, the Surface Laptop II is the best-suited computer for <em>my personal uses</em> that I’ve ever owned <em>or</em> used for any length of time. Subjectively, I don’t think all of the hardware design touches that make it so – like its keyboard layout, divine 3:2 aspect ratio, and particular I/O complement – have yet had the chance to seduce my emotional brain into truly <em>loving</em> it as much as I certainly should by any reasonable measure. For my own sake, I hope I’m able to fall in child-like infatuation with its magic, but in the interim, I believe the coldness of my heart should hopefully preserve any useful commentary I might have to add. Though this is undoubtedly the most timely review of a hardware product I’ve ever published, I’d still ask that you indulge my perspective suggesting the importance of considering it part of a <em>package</em> with its operating system, considering that the whole of tech media would’ve unanimously declared it the year’s “<a href="https://mashable.com/review/microsoft-surface-laptop-2/">best laptop</a>” were Apple’s aging, but still widely-adored MacOS absent from the frame.</p>

<blockquote><p>I&#39;ve tested a bunch of laptops this year, running the spectrum of 2-in-1s, Chromebooks, MacBooks, gaming laptops, etc. Everyone&#39;s needs are going to be different, which is why there&#39;s no such thing as a one-size-fits-all for laptops. But enthusiasts’ laptops aside, I strongly feel the Surface Laptop 2 is the best laptop of the year. And by that I mean the best laptop for most folks&#39; needs.</p></blockquote>

<p>With as much humility as possible, I must add that I myself am <em>anything</em> but “most folks,” yet my experience so far with the product has been one of astonishing compatibility and battery life. Using recommended power settings, the Surface Laptop 2 endured <a href="https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/1080514545062477825"><strong>four hours and twenty-two minutes</strong></a> of a workload it wasn’t particularly designed for including heavy web browsing, image manipulation, brief audio/video capture with OBS, and moderate subsequent editing in Audacity and OpenShot. Dan Seifert – Vox Media’s “<a href="https://www.recode.net/2017/5/12/15628228/microsoft-surface-laptop-apple-macbook-air-windows-10s-dan-seifert-recode-podcast">only Windows user</a>” – reported “about seven hours” of Microsoft’s claimed 14.5, but frankly, I don’t know what any of y’all are doin – I’m just thankful this machine is a better marathoner than any other I can recall owning. While we’re on the subject, I consider Microsoft’s inclusion of a magnetically-attached power cable and unassuming auxiliary USB charging port on the attached power supply to be personal godsends – further evidence, even, that the Surface Laptop 2 was <em>actually designed to be nice to use</em>. For the sake of those readers <strong>actually in the market for a new laptop</strong> who’ve somehow found themselves here, though, Raymond Wong’s review for <em>Mashable</em> is the most thorough offering you’ll find – it’s quoted front and center on <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/surface-laptop-2/8XQJKK3DD91B">Microsoft’s web page for the Laptop II</a>, even – but it’s important to mention that his critical comparative perspective predates the late launch of its ultimate competitor, <a href="https://mashable.com/review/apple-macbook-air/">the new MacBook Air</a>. Rather pitifully, however, his colleague’s “good, but not great” resolution suggests that Apple failed to challenge Microsoft’s relatively moderate update enough to warrant any revision, and that <em>Mashable</em> as a publication stands by my new laptop’s <em>Best of the Year</em> title, for whatever it may or may not be worth to you.</p>

<blockquote><p>If the new <a href="https://zdcs.link/zjWl1?pageview=06Fe2GZo26XvMYZgLndTadT">MacBook Air</a> came in at the same price as the old one, it would be a steal. Sure, you pay for the privilege of being able to use macOS on the Apple ecosystem. But in years past that also meant access to cutting-edge features and design. As pretty as the MacBook Air is, there&#39;s nothing that innovative about it. In today&#39;s Apple, it seems, privilege amounts to just staying current.</p></blockquote>

<p>You won’t find many others who regularly invest editorial merit in publishing 2500+ word laptop reviews anymore, which I’d concede is plenty reasonable in the Surface Laptop’s case, at least. Perhaps your first point of comparative entry should be <a href="https://www.recode.net/2017/5/12/15628228/microsoft-surface-laptop-apple-macbook-air-windows-10s-dan-seifert-recode-podcast">a barely-dated conversation</a> between Kara Swisher, Lauren Goode, and Dan Seifert on <em>Too Embarrassed to Ask</em> regarding the original’s odds of truly competing in the “premium laptop” segment (if you’d prefer to hear from those who struggle to take it seriously, that is.) Assuming <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/what-oems-desperately-need-to-learn-from-microsofts-surface/">the original product direction of the Surface line</a> still stands, Microsoft doesn’t actually intend to sell at high volume, especially when it comes to this runt of the marque, which does not hesitate to omit itself from the popular discourse of the moment surrounding tablets as the future of all computing to which all of its siblings have <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/5/23/5743416/microsoft-surface-pro-3-review">contributed so much</a>. Though I shall always remember my dearest Libel (the special edition Spectre x360 with which I built most of <em>Extratone</em>) with great respect and deep fondness – I think it’s even worth mounting on some sort of plinth – the significantly-cheaper Laptop II has already demonstrated true value in its “premium” segment bragging rights with <em>far</em> superior materials and build quality. If you’re looking for the prettiest possible slice of magnesium lightness but aren’t the sort to have followed the story of Microsoft’s first venture into personal computer production since it began in the last year of the Mayan calendar, it’s worth your while to read <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/6/19/3097726/surface-microsoft-next-chapter/in/2859835">Joshua Topolsky’s projections of the project’s impact on the popular narrative surrounding Microsoft</a> from history’s freshest possible perspective: the eve of the first Surface tablet’s launch.</p>

<blockquote><p>The entire tablet was designed in-house by Microsoft&#39;s teams, and if you believe what was said in the presentation yesterday, design and functionality in hardware has suddenly become a big deal in Redmond. That&#39;s a big shift, and it&#39;s an important one. The announcement of the Surface shows that Microsoft is ready to make a break with its history — a history of hardware partnerships which relied on companies like Dell, HP, or Acer to actually bring its products to market. That may burn partners in the short term, but it could also give Microsoft something it desperately needs: a clear story.</p></blockquote>

<p>A pungent stigma festered from Microsoft’s history of inadequate and inelegant public relations (especially compared to its greatest longtime rival) has remained in relentlessly obvious orbit around every “significant” Windows and Office update for so long that its status quo has grown into a truly inhibitive force for <em>all</em> parties involved. Topolsky is unquestionably a compromising favorite of mine, but it’s hard not to decry then-CEO Steve Ballmer’s failure to comprehend Josh’s day-after insight in the <em>whole three months</em> that passed before <a href="http://old.seattletimes.com/html/businesstechnology/2019168601_microsoftballmer16.html">his Seattle Times interview in September, 2012</a>. Ultimately, The Big M is either <strong>incapable</strong> of understanding any alternative utopic Visions of Computing to its own, or simply <strong>overwrought</strong> with the same counteraspirational carelessness its culture has always depended upon. In analytical terms regarding Ballmer’s utilization of the forum’s opportunity to finally <em>tell the fucking story</em>, at least, the timidity of a term like “pre-eminent software” as a viably bright new beacon in contrast with “<em>people</em> would say we were a software company” (emphasis mine) – as if Steve-O himself doesn’t even have the power to publicly <em>describe his company’s function</em> as its #1 man – combined at the apex of what was almost impressively-negligent behavior.</p>

<blockquote><p>I think when you look forward, our core capability will be software, (but) you&#39;ll probably think of us more as a devices-and-services company. Which is a little different. Software powers devices and software powers these cloud services, but it&#39;s a different form of delivery...</p></blockquote>

<p>Don’t make the same mistake I did and wear yourself out trying to extract the meaning from these three sentences – there’s none to be found. Ultimately, whatever opportunity the Surface project could have provided for Microsoft’s identity has been vastly overshadowed by its success as last resort supercatalyst to restore <em>any</em> sense of dignity and pride within the hardware companies who produce the vehicles. In Fall 2017, <em>The Register</em> <a href="https://www.theregister.co.uk/2017/10/04/surface/">quoted industry gossip</a> regarding the company’s new CEO Satya Nadella and his intent to “exit the product line” because “overall they are not making money [and] it doesn’t make sense for them to be in this business,” but newcomers to this conversation should know that no subsequent reporting has corroborated anything but a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/5/18125306/microsoft-fluent-design-windows-office-surface-future">sustaining future of the line</a>, though the measurable rate of innovation in Microsoft’s products continues to leave much to be desired. Now that you’ve heard from the experts, though, allow me to expand our lens a bit and examine what the Surface Laptop 2’s existence suggests as per <em>The Present &amp; Future of Computing</em>.</p>

<h2 id="the-clam-clan">The Clam Clan</h2>

<p>In case I’ve yet to mention it, all of my tech writing is in substantial debt to my much-older and child-oriented siblings for providing 8 nieces and nephews over the course of 11 years – if not for any reason but the perspective offered by the slightest observation of their day-to-day lives. In this profoundly bizarre and historic technological sprint our species is experiencing, the differences in their respective relationships with consumer tech as they’ve grown up are fascinatingly… disturbingly significant. My eldest niece Abby was born four years after myself in 1998, and her younger sister Amber just quite three years later in 2001. All three of us are Aquarians who went to the same public schools (aside from 2 exceptions on my part,) and the two sisters have been close, significant influences on each other all their lives, yet the way Abby and I use and think about computers differs significantly from Amber’s. Our first real PCs introduced an important social and intellectual vehicle to our pre-teen lives, and both of us still “live on” our machines as young adults. For us and many others from this short-lived microgeneration of ours, budget laptops like the Dell Inspirion 2200 (which served as the first “real computer” for both of us) introduced the internet and Being Online as a State of Being with AIM groups, MySpace, and Yahoo! chain mails before smartphones and tablets were capable of doing so.</p>

<p>Amber prefers to use her iPhone for most everything and regards her computer as a tool for work – it’s booted up and down exclusively for that purpose, which is significantly healthier than the habit Abby, myself, and many of my Online friends developed: we left our computers running and Logged On all the time because we were otherwise unreachable. We learned from origin to depend on them for 100% of our computing tasks – from streaming Pandora to playing Flash games within six billion open browser tabs – which likely explains both our ADD and its resulting influence on the ease with which our personal computers can distract us. As a Journalism student and professional photographer, Abby uses the new 15-inch MacBook Pro, and [Insane Blogger] David Blue has spent years looking for an alternative, becoming <a href="ios-10-review-speed/index.html">the first and only iPhone user to make extensive use of its Bluetooth keyboard support</a> in the process, but both of us are entirely uninterested in the rest of the industry’s insistence on <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/2/17515896/dell-xps-2-in-1-convertible-laptop-review">convertibles</a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/16/17979504/microsoft-surface-pro-6-review-tablet-features-price-windows-10-matte-black">removable keyboards</a>, or <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/5/18062612/apple-ipad-pro-review-2018-screen-usb-c-pencil-price-features">‘professional’ tablets</a>. I wish the Linux community was finally ready to drop the elitist pretenses plaguing its nerdy history; I wish I could finally tell someone like Abby that a machine like the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/3198671/linux/the-system76-galago-pro-is-a-fierce-featherweight-competitor.html">System76 Galago Pro</a> could slot itself into her workflow without losing her time or compatibility – that the reputation surrounding Linux People had finally lost most of its validity and her desire to learn more about computing as a young woman and Power User would be met with respectful and worthwhile conversation from their end. Unfortunately, I’ve still found some of the Old Guard to be elitist, socially behind, and juvenilely possessive, as if computing was still the niche interest from their 1980s and 90s childhoods. Though this conversation certainly warrants its own essay in the future, I’ll just express now that it’s a real shame some folks don’t realize the entire point of making great things is ultimately to <strong>give them to the world</strong>.</p>

<p>The opportunity I’ve had in the past year to finally get my Linux distro frenzy over with and out of my system managed to both radicalize and democratize my understanding of MacOS, Windows, and Linux as they are in the present. While I had nothing better to do, fiddling with Ubuntu Studio and Linux Mint to the extent I did throughout Spring and Summer led me to further appreciate <a href="https://mastodon.social/@DavidBlue/101073796864823479">the value of keyboard shortcuts</a>, gave me <a href="https://mastodon.social/@DavidBlue/100917824456128537">my first real proficiency with a command line</a>, helped <a href="https://anchor.fm/davidblue/episodes/Revelations-of-Network-Withdrawals-e2d7aq/a-a235vs3">globalize my comprehension of my own technological privilege</a>, reacquainted me in a huge way with both <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/vintagecomputing/comments/9hpqov/lotussmartsuite_and_the_year_2000/">the true history of software</a> and my own personal past as <a href="https://mastodon.social/@DavidBlue/100771954295147256">an experimental test tube baby of Microsoft’s</a>, and helped to answer a lot of questions I’d worried over for years about why software seemed like it simply <em>couldn’t improve</em> anymore. While it’s true that important open source projects like <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jasonevangelho/2018/09/10/elementary-os-first-impressions-a-great-linux-doorway-for-macos-users/#231f4faa4289">ElementaryOS</a> continue to sprout from the Linus Extended Universe and the <a href="http://bit.ly/dbmastodon">growing Open Source community on Mastodon</a> is filled with brilliant, helpful, unpretentious, and remarkably curious enthusiasts (probably because many of those I’ve interacted with so far are non-cis and/or non-white,) little ole me was able to stumble upon some totally unnecessary and excruciatingly ignorant sociopolitical commentary by way of the white, middle-age host and his undoubtedly-white and staunchly libertarian caller on a live broadcast of the <em>Ask Noah Show</em>. (It’s not as if I haven’t said ignorant and very ugly things too, but I wasn’t a forty-something <em>father</em> on a semi-professional talk show representing an entire community.)</p>

<p>Essentially, I was quite frustrated and disappointed to find that <strong>Linux is still let down most by its own community</strong>, but the operating system itself is still <em>much</em> further along on its way to becoming a real alternative for the average user than mainstream tech journalism would have you believe. However, in my case, finally taking the time to <em>really</em> learn about Open Source computing <em>also</em> helped me understand (surprisingly) why Apple and its environment continue to be the best and most popular choice for professional applications. Linux Mint gave me tremendous power in enabling me to alter, specify, and redesign the most minute details of its interface, but I couldn’t have foreseen how all-consuming such power would be for someone like myself. In retrospect, I’ve realized that I ended up spending more time perfecting my custom LibreOffice Writer shortcuts than I did <em>actually writing</em> – I somehow found myself in a mind state which justified unironically creating <em>a shortcut for the Shortcuts menu</em>. Though I swore I’d never succumb to the bewildering hobby of collecting and exploring different Linux Distributions, it took no time at all for me to fill a folder with disc images of the installers for almost a dozen different interpretations of the operating system after I’d made the simple concession to myself that <em>I’ll just try Ubuntu, that’s all</em>. The most profound realization from all this (arguably otherwise wasted) time: <strong>for a user like me, a walled garden is actually the best place to be productive</strong> because <em>apparently</em>, I don’t have the self-control to keep myself from <em>running away</em> and/or fixating on completely unproductive tasks without its boundaries. I think this phenomenon is perhaps the worst culprit in the persistence of the aforementioned divide between “computer people” and everyone else who simply <em>uses</em> computers, as I’m sure any one of the latter could tell you after all of five minutes with a Linus type.</p>

<p>The most comprehensive and somewhat-urgent revision to illustrate the significance of this contrast from my perspective regards the exceptional iOS/MacOS markdown-based notetaking app Bear. Frankly, my own “<a href="evernote-dropbox-paper-word-processing-history.html">Word Processing Methodology</a>” essay from June has already become problematically out of date (and therefore embarrassing) in terms of my own knowledge of the segment and its history. Though I promised the conversation was “done,” I’ve continued to explore further into word processing’s history as well as its current state. “I had a go at Bear’s free iOS experience and saw little functional difference from DayOne,” the old, negligent, cursory David Blue noted, but if I’d simply been willing to cough up a bit more time and just $1.49 a month for <a href="https://bear.app/#pricing">Bear Pro</a>, I’d have spared myself such shame and realized that the hype around this app really is 100% justified. <strong>Bear is the most beautiful iOS app I’ve ever seen</strong>, but I’m now also fully qualified to declare it the most effective execution of “distraction-free” writing software to come along in the past 25 years. Developer Shiny Frog’s secret is their perfect balance between capability and simplicity. It turns out, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/2/14785264/evernote-replacement-bear-app">Daily Content Lord Casey Newton’s word on this matter</a> <em>really was</em> worth more than mine, not to mention more succinct: “Bear may look simple, but there’s power underneath the surface.”</p>

<p>Those longtime Linux and Windows diehards who’ve tolerated me thus far, listen up: MacOS may be ancient, neglected, and full of incongruencies, but its single-minded methodology paired with Apple’s iCloud <em>really does</em> make it the most effective and elegant environment for most people to simply <em>get shit done</em>. It’s clear that many of you have realized the importance of simplicity for compact and/or educational distributions, but let me just add that <strong>the democratization of Linux provides a gargantuan development opportunity to make something that beats MacOS at its own game</strong> without starting from such a shitty premise and all of its resulting compromises – all without detracting from any other technically-minded distributions whatsoever. <em>That</em> is the magic of <em>The Distro</em>, remember?! If you’ve existed in a similar state of confusion to that of my entire adult life regarding the appeal of Apple products – despite having once been an extensive OSX user, myself – <em>you’re very welcome</em> for the insight. Instead of paying me for the profound self-improvement I’ve just provided, try prioritizing this newfound knowledge the next time you talk to your MacBook Pro-loving friend about their workflow. If you’re like myself, you’ll find their arguments have magically transformed from the bewildering bullshit they’ve always seemed to be into challenges for future competing operating systems to surpass Apple’s old bitch and excel in because MacOS and <a href="siri-shortcuts-ios12-review.html">even its much-younger iOS counterpart</a> – as well as the billions of people who depend on them – <em>desperately</em> need real competition in order to maintain their viability, much less become what products of the world’s wealthiest company <em>should</em> be.</p>

<p>Yes, the manner in which these operating systems are perceived really <em>is</em> an important discussion prompted by a product as insignificant as the Surface Laptop 2 because as you read, the industry is bracing for another <em>paradigm shift</em> in computing, which many believe (preposterously, I might add) could be as significant and disruptive as 2007’s introduction of the iPhone. This machine of Microsoft’s and its “new” MacBook Air counterpart could potentially be the last designs to carry us to a computing future where the tried-and-true clamshell design is forgone entirely by the mainstream, but <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/oct/30/apple-new-ipad-pro-launched-all-screen-design-face-id-usb-c-processor-magnetic-keyboard">Apple’s release of this year’s new iPad Pro</a> prompted even <a href="https://supercomputer.transistor.fm/13">the most Cupertino-loving</a> tech commentators to respond with <em>genuine discord</em> along with a few long-overdue shouts of “<em>are you crazy</em>?!” I’m very proud of <em>The Verge</em>’s <a href="http://twitter.com/reckless">Nilay Patel</a>, in particular, for so eloquently deconstructing its usability for all but the very wealthy. “It is impossible to look at a device this powerful and expensive and not expect it to replace a laptop for day-to-day work,” he reminds us in the introduction to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/5/18062612/apple-ipad-pro-review-2018-screen-usb-c-pencil-price-features">his full review of the updated product</a>, along with a beautifully transient sentiment which I think we all needed to hear again: “I don’t think people should adapt to their computers. Computers should adapt to people.” Even something as consumerist and bourgeois as the introduction of another pricepoint-burgeoning Apple hardware flagship can turn a simple tablet review into a much-needed manifesto for a user-centric way forward for the industry, which is itself worthy of celebratory encouragement.</p>

<p>I’ve favored <em>The Verge</em> and its cast long past the point of excess throughout the span of my work about technology, but Nilay’s review and its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/8/18075992/vergecast-podcast-330-ipad-pro-macbook-air-review">accompanying episode of <em>The Vergecast</em></a> are <em>truly</em> special and profound gems of content that shouldn’t be passed up. Apparently – as the Editor-in-Chief immediately insists as the episode begins – his “ongoing theory” that “the more important you are, the less actually important work you do, and the more likely you are to be an iPad user” roused anger from “that whole class of [billionaires,]” but the experiences behind his argument actually suggest that Apple’s own favorite child of late – into which it has begun investing and thereby implicitly <em>sponsoring</em> over its much older brother as the ultimate heir of the majority’s future computing – has unequivocally <strong>failed</strong> to do its part in growing the iPad Pro into the “laptop replacement” we’d all heard so much about. Of iOS 12’s performance as an operating system beneath true work-related tasks, he exasperates “you have to spend all of your time figuring out how to do stuff instead of doing stuff,” which I couldn’t help but hear as echoes of my own late Linux lamentations. As thankful as I am to have finally achieved enlightenment of the Planet Apple, I’m afraid I was pitifully late: its very natural laws underwent their most brutal tests of the 21st century this past year. Now that I’ve finally come to adore the elegant effectiveness of a new generation of iOS apps like Bear, I’m faced with yet another of the episode’s statements of weight: “I think it’s time to stop pretending that the future of computing looks like Apple’s restrictions.” On the opposing end of the line, the world’s first trillion-dollar company’s <em>other</em> major product release of 2018 <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018/11/09/apple-macbook-air-review-2018/">managed to disappoint</a> even the most fanatical fans of its original operating system’s best-selling platform with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/6/18064552/macbook-air-2018-review-retina-keyboard-apple-features-battery-price">an insultingly mediocre update to the MacBook Air</a> marque upon which it <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2008/01/25/macbook-air-review/">once so fondly doted</a>.</p>

<p>My best friend’s parents bought her <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/10/23/3540550/microsoft-surface-review">the original Surface tablet</a> when she enrolled in art school, and her frustration with its lackluster keyboard (among others) leads MacOS alternative-seeking users like us to wish Microsoft had started with a traditional design like the Surface Laptop first. Perhaps Apple and Microsoft’s emphasis on their tablets is nothing but a bit premature for the <em>most</em> current crop of users, and the rest of my nieces and nephews will expand upon an entirely different methodology of usership when they receive their freshman computer. Those elders of us who still take the Clamshell form seriously and love printing our documents are apparently facing a future industry saturated with products we can’t believe in, but it’s up to you to decide if this issue is worth expending your energy in advocacy for either camp. With my 120+ word per minute proficiency with physical keyboards, <em>I</em> for one have been completely bewildered by the iPad as anything but an indulgence for reading text on the web, and I’m pleased as punch with my Surface Laptop 2. Even if it proves to be the last new computer I’ll ever own to come as optimized for my use, I’m just grateful and astonished it happens to be the best yet.</p>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="book e-content"><p><img src="https://i.snap.as/7wrQ9DPN.jpg" alt="Through an iPhone 4&#39;s Lens"/></p>

<h2 id="seven-years-ago-the-fourth-generation-of-apple-s-iphone-instigated-a-change-in-our-perception-of-digital-photography-now-thanks-to-google-photos-i-d-like-to-reflect-on-my-favorite-shots-of-mine">Seven years ago, the fourth generation of Apple’s iPhone instigated a change in our perception of digital photography. Now – thanks to Google Photos – I’d like to reflect on my favorite shots of mine.</h2>

<p>When iPhone 4 handsets began shipping in the Summer of 2010, I’d been carrying my first generation for three solid years – since its now history-stricken release, in fact – and its age started to become a problem. I’d drop it screen-down on a rock in the airport parking lot just before going back to school for my Junior year, splitting a crack in the screen that wouldn’t quite kill it – it was the demands of iOS 4 on its 412 MHz CPU and meager 128 MB of RAM that would ultimately cease its usability.</p>

<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fJOMiTeDERY" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>The single 2 megapixel rear-facing camera would surprise one at times, but was never lauded as anything but what it was – a mobile phone-bound sensor capturing very cellular-looking* images, but Steve Jobs wasn’t <a href="https://youtu.be/z__jxoczNWc?t=2m10s">three minutes in</a> to his iPhone 4 presentation at the June 2010 Worldwide Developer’s Conference before he pronounced the design’s closest possible “kin” to be “an old Leica camera,” associating his device with photography in its first impression. The equivalent of the first generation’s rear-facing camera could now be found facing <em>you</em>, and the fourth’s primary sensor now shot at 5 megapixels (2592 x 1936) with autofocus and 5x digital zoom, setting a fundamental smartphone sensor configuration <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/9/9/6125849/iphone-history-pictures">standard</a> that’s still adhered to by the industry.</p>

<p>After unleashing Google Photos upon the ~15,000 images on my home machine’s hard drive last year, I have been constantly reminded of my own photographic history – for better or worse – and regularly shown five, six, seven-year old snaps in a manner that wouldn’t have been possible (or have made any sense) before. Recently, I was astounded to find that I took many of the better shots with my iPhone 4, so I thought I’d share a few from my high-school days in loving memory of my trusty little rectangular companion.</p>

<h2 id="setting-out-upon-a-desperate-personal-journey-to-rediscover-enchantment-with-computers">Setting out upon a desperate personal journey to rediscover enchantment with computers.</h2>

<p>This evening, a pack­age is sched­uled to arrive upon my doorstep con­tain­ing a Com­paq Portable Plus lug­gable com­put­er from 1983 which I have fan­ta­sized about buy­ing for far too many years. Despite liv­ing in the midst of per­haps the worst pos­si­ble finan­cial sit­u­a­tion to spend $139.99 out­right on a rel­ic of com­put­ing, I final­ly <em>just bought one any­way</em> last Thurs­day because I’m absolute­ly fed up with life with­out the mag­ic I remem­ber feel­ing from com­put­ers. Yes, I am hav­ing a mid-life crises and The Machine is just a phys­i­cal man­i­fes­ta­tion of one of my favorite sto­ries, but I expect it will pro­vide some­thing irre­place­able for me and at least one piece of enter­tain­ment for just about any­body: <strong>I’m going to start a pho­to­series of myself using the 26-lb., suit­case-like, and utter­ly time-dis­placed Portable Plus in dif­fer­ent cof­fee shops through­out Port­land</strong>.</p>

<p>There’s also poten­tial oppor­tu­ni­ty (or neces­si­ty) for me to make use of my lim­it­ed knowl­edge of hard­ware elec­tron­ics. I’ve nev­er been very com­fort­able with open­ly using the term “hob­by,” but I ful­ly intend to savor, doc­u­ment, and pre­serve every pos­si­ble detail of my expe­ri­ence, so we’re going to behave as if the tales of com­put­er his­to­ry are pre­cious to a ded­i­cat­ed audi­ence besides myself, and that I am there­by and here­after bind­ing myself to an impor­tant duty of dis­cov­ery, cura­tion, and pre­sen­ta­tion expressed through mul­ti­me­dia of the high­est pos­si­ble cal­iber.</p>

<h1 id="why-compaq">Why Compaq?</h1>

<p>Put sim­ply, <strong>Com­paq was punk as fuck</strong>. Three dorky Tex­an techn­odads pre­med­i­tat­ed their leave of fair, secure jobs in the indus­try in order to bet every­thing on the promise of a sin­gle unde­ni­ably pro-user ide­al to dis­rupt its dom­i­nant monop­o­lis­tic supervil­lian. Unlike any of the count­less oth­er sto­ries from the infor­ma­tion age with the very same intro­duc­tion, theirs was imme­di­ate­ly pro­pelled into stratos­pher­ic, record-break­ing suc­cess — from cof­fee table sketch­es in the waste­lands of sub­ur­ban Hous­ton nights to <em>one bil­lion dol­lars</em> <a href="https://usatoday30.usatoday.com/tech/techinvestor/2001-09-04-compaq-history.htm">in less than five years</a>, prov­ing that it was pos­si­ble to win huge in tech by com­mit­ting sin­cere­ly to lib­er­at­ing the con­sumer and man­i­fest­ing the ulti­mate per­for­mance of <a href="https://www.sciencefriday.com/segments/a-david-and-goliath-story-for-personal-computers/">the under­dog com­plex</a> Amer­i­can busi­ness has ever wit­nessed.</p>

<p>Those of us who’ve main­tained some curi­ous orbit of tech­nol­o­gy have recent­ly entered a rec­on­cil­la­to­ry process as the world has become all at once inti­mate­ly famil­iar with our col­lec­tive pur­suits’ true con­se­quences. Nev­er has it been more appro­pri­ate to reflect on the whole­some brava­do of the only Amer­i­can com­put­er com­pa­ny to build a bil­lion-dol­lar busi­ness atop the sole mantra of user lib­er­a­tion. At a glance one might assume that AMC’s attempt to repro­duce <em>Mad Men’s</em> for­mu­la with a sto­ry set in Compaq’s ori­gin in a series that’s sup­pos­ed­ly attract­ed a fair num­ber of Net­flix­ers called <em>Halt and Catch Fire</em> in con­junc­tion with the 2016 doc­u­men­tary <a href="https://www.houstonchronicle.com/entertainment/movies/article/Silicon-Cowboys-captures-shooting-star-that-9227131.php"><em>Sil­i­con Cow­boys</em></a> have suf­fi­cient­ly remind­ed Amer­i­ca of to whom it real­ly owes its priv­i­leged tech indus­try. How­ev­er, a <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=" title="compaq">Twit­ter search</a> for “Com­paq” turns up vir­tu­al­ly noth­ing of con­se­quence, and — on the oth­er cul­tur­al spec­trum — I’ve yet to see a sin­gle well-doc­u­ment­ed col­lec­tion of Com­paq hard­ware, and I’m unsat­is­fied.</p>

<p>Like it not, you’re com­ing with me on a safari back through two full nos­tal­gic cycles to redis­cov­er our won­der and excite­ment about tech­nol­o­gy because I miss it des­per­ate­ly and I know you do too. We’re going to find some­thing mar­velous.</p>

<p>I believe com­put­ers can be mag­ic again.</p>

<p>I believe in Com­paq.</p>

<p><em>Is my True Tone bullshit on?</em></p>

<p>“True Tone” is so forgettable, everybody had to mention it first. Quite simply, it uses an ambient light sensor to fiddle with white balance, warming the colors of the display as an immediately-obvious whole, yes, but an interesting contrast to show off is no longer inherently justified in being called a “feature” in Apple products, anymore. Essentially, no matter who you ask (aside from <a href="https://youtu.be/AXU8GqaMsQc?t=7m23s">Jon Rettinger</a>,) you <em>should not</em> buy an iPhone 8, though I did last Fall, not only because I had to suddenly decide on a handset in less than 24 hours, but — if anything — to say goodbye to the form, the operating system, and the tech company which I have depended upon and carried with me virtually every day for my entire adult life. I’d originally decided to abandon this review due to a variety of unexpected circumstances, but Apple and its iPhone have maintained their place in the news with their <a href="https://www.apple.com/iphone-battery-and-performance/">battery scandal</a>, and a third of a year with the 8 Plus has included some experiences which warrant a send-off before iOS 12 is released, making it (and myself) totally irrelevant forever.</p>

<p>As the longstanding benchmark of the smartphone industry’s state at any given time, the iPhone can be easy to reflect upon as a product once occupying a state of universal exemption from criticism, but it has, in fact, <a href="http://theweek.com/articles/459748/7-reviews-original-iphone-from-2007">never been so</a>. As Nilay Patel <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/9/19/16323570/apple-new-iphone-8-review-plus-2017">noted</a>, one might regard the 8 as the last compromise of “basically four years” of the same design. Since launch, it’s unsurprisingly stayed a wee bit too far behind on the spreadsheets for most Android-type folks — not that I’ve ever believed them truthfully incapable of comprehending what it means to <em>package</em> a product, given where their greasy startups all eventually ended up. (<strong>You cannot doubt me</strong> — I once took a year-long sabbatical from iOS with a <a href="https://youtu.be/nSWgS0l0kc8">Sony Xperia Play</a>, and my authority is absolute.) The rest are trying to decide whether or not to pay $200 more for “<a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/iphone-8-apples-middle-child-1505322945">the phone of the future</a>,” which knows when you’re watching it, and is only good for playing half an hour of stupid video games before it needs a charge.</p>

<p>So far, I have maintained that my first generation iPhone was the best handset of all time — one hell of an Email Machine that lasted me close to five years — throughout the last two with actual motherboard exposed to the elements in the corner of its cracked screen. That said, who knows how it’d feel to be coerced into using “iPhone OS 2” as it was called, then, for an entire workday in 2018? Two years prior to bringing home an 8 Plus, I <a href="http://bit.ly/drycast47">vowed</a> that my 6S Plus would be my last ever Apple device, but this one <em>actually</em> feels like a last hurrah. Though the ability to <em>Tweet directly from the swipe-down notification menu</em> is still nowhere to be found (it’s been gone for 5 releases, now, and would seem to have been forgotten by <em>literally</em> everyone but myself,) one gets the sense that Apple’s efforts to add to the iPhone 8 and iOS 11 were to make amends with us by settling a few debts.</p>

<p>In part, they did. Native apps got a major overhaul — including Mail, which was startling, considering that I’d been looking at what was near as makes no difference the same UI my eldest phone shipped with. As a result, it alone constitutes my benchmark for an email service, and I have been left without a clue as to what <em>a good one</em> looks like. (Apparently it was <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/article/342889/the-best-mobile-email-client-apps">really bad</a>?) Since time began, there has always been at least one alternative email app of the moment that tech journos refer to as the must-have, end-all replacement. <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/email-edison-mail/id922793622?mt=8">Edison Mail</a> is currently the smoother, faster, most modular option — at least for another few minutes– but I’ll never know it as I know Mail, and I’ll never want to. Playing around with experimental email apps is too scary. What if I decide once again to kill that massive number in the red badge and need to immediately mark 40,000 emails as read? It took all of my iPhone 4’s 1.0Ghz CPU and proprietary software over 18 hours — how am I supposed to trust a shabby little 6-month-old startup with such an important task? Anybody with a hundred bucks can make an app, you know.</p>

<h3 id="why-is-the-app-store-now-the-best-looking-publishing-software-on-ios">Why is the App Store now the best-looking publishing software on iOS?</h3>

<p>One might interpret the App Store’s redesign as an attempt by Apple to control this conversation — of both the trending <em>new thing</em> and the old“essentials” that you’ve probably had tucked away in an untouched folder for years. Technically, whoever the hell is writing those gorgeously-presented daily bits has made them a publishing company, though I’m not so sure I’m not the last remaining user who’s continued semi-regularly visiting their “Today” section. If I <em>did</em> want to actually read about apps (I don’t — who does?) it wouldn’t make much sense to seek critical reviews from the faceless boffins behind the platform itself, regardless of how much better it may look than all of the tech news sites, paywall or no.</p>

<p>Native screen recording could conceivably come in handy once or twice, but I see no reason why the red bar must remain at the top of the render, but it has, which could explain the total lack of any such video in the wild. Front-facing 4K, 60fps capture is impressive, but useless — vloggers all have GoPros or DSLRs, these days, and sharing through Snapchat and Instagram will always be ultra-compressed. (Here are two sloppy test clips — <a href="https://youtu.be/VnfkWkotGFw">at the zoo</a>, and <a href="https://youtu.be/KOs5m6ynKAI">fishing</a>.)</p>

<p>Perhaps some have figured out the new Files “app,” but it’s sat on my homescreen for months, untapped, and it will likely remain there for all time as a sort of soothing trophy — a thanks for my legacy iPhone loyalty. My reward for half a lifetime of syncing, scrolling, and tolling? <strong>I can now view some of the files on my Mobile Computing Device</strong>, and even <em>scan documents in</em>, which is mostly novel (though it is fun to digitize excerpts from physical text.) At some point, I must’ve mischecked a permanent option because all file types now open only in an app that does not recognize them. God bless.</p>

<p><img src="https://i.snap.as/fuMs1a4.jpg" alt="Roof Photo"/></p>

<p>Somehow, I’ve managed to fill my social circle with precisely zero iOS-using folks. All of my friends and colleagues use Android devices (including <a href="https://soundcloud.com/extratonemagazine/nextbit">Tim’s supercool Nextbit Robin</a>,) which provide a few handy datapoints (like the camera in <a href="https://flic.kr/p/BXruaL">my fiance’s Galaxy S8</a>,) but deprive me of any significant experience with the ostensibly intoxicating cult of iMessage. I’m constantly listening to and reading tech writers claim that it’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/10/10/13225514/apple-iphone-cant-switch-pixel-android-imessage-addiction">one of the only reasons they’re still using iPhones</a>, but my own food-OS loving biome has forced me to find others, and frankly, I can’t imagine looking at the <a href="http://www.extratone.com/audio/futureland/toomanymessengers/"><em>gluttonous</em></a> palate of available mobile, cross-platform messaging services (Telegram, <a href="https://telegram.org/blog/telegram-x">now Telegram X</a>, WhatsApp, Signal, Snapchat, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Discord, Slack, <em>Tinder?</em>, Google Hangouts, Google Allo, Google Chat, Viber, Skype, Line, Wire, etc.) and thinking… <em>well, none of this will do</em>!</p>

<p>Honestly — even if I’d actually been at all informed in my haste, the photographic capabilities of the 8 Plus, alone would’ve sold it. It’s not the new filters, gif functionality, or even “3D Photos” — it’s those mythical dual 12MP sensors (which it shares with something called the iPhone X.) They’re no less than infallible. After four months of <a href="http://bit.ly/ip8plus">astonishing captures</a>in all manner of conditions, I don’t even care how exactly they do it anymore — it’s better to be left marveling. This first example was taken at Keystone, Colorado in the middle of a dark, cloudy Fall night — the amount of light they were able to find — “up to 80% more,” <a href="https://www.apple.com/apple-events/september-2017/">according to Apple</a> — is just <em>impossible</em>.</p>

<p><em>The vast majority of the samples in my iPhone 8 Flickr Album were taken within the native Camera app as it ships and left unedited. (Especially before just a few weeks ago, when I <a href="https://extratone.com/race-day-at-hodges">discovered Halide</a>.</em></p>

<p><img src="https://i.snap.as/C2LLJAl5.jpg" alt="Oregon Coast - iPhone 8 Plus"/></p>

<p>Here is an unquestionably sensible progression from which iPhone has never wavered far since its fourth generation <a href="http://www.extratone.com/words/inred/iphone4/">set the standard</a>, but it’s one of an unfortunate few. Siri is still useless and silly apart from its “disable all alarms” feature and its ability to sound itself off in response when you’re hysterically screaming and digging for it through the vast plush of a forty-year-old Lincoln. The customizable Control Center makes toggling low power mode, orientation lock, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth less frustrating (note the last two <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/how-to-turn-off-wifi-and-bluetooth-in-ios11/">aren’t quite hard switches</a>,) though it should’ve come years ago. Notifications are slightly more sensible -certainly better than they were on Android Gingerbread, but I’ve heard things’ve changed quite a bit since then.</p>

<p>I <em>have</em> been tripped up by the lack of a 3.5mm audio jack a few times, but it just <a href="http://www.extratone.com/words/inred/mono/">wouldn’t make sense</a> from a hardware perspective, and the new external stereo capability should refute those who can’t or won’t understand. Yes, it would be nice if Apple hadn’t led the industry to quite such a compromising obsession with thinness — we’d all trade <em>a lot</em>of substance for exponentially greater battery life, storage capacity, water resistance, etc. — but I don’t see much sense in expending your energy holding up signs in Silicon Valley.</p>

<blockquote><p>I’ll be here long after you’ve died, and you know why?
Because I took the time to sync my apps.</p></blockquote>

<p>Two years ago, a new generation of social apps and the preposterous notion of a quad-core CPU in my iPhone 6S Plus seemed like the harbinger of a world I no longer understood. Now, most of those services have expanded to the far boundaries of my reach, and I’ve stopped counting chips. Refinement of the hardware design is reverent to the extreme. It’s pretentious, but Apple’s decision to pause on the 8 to consider details like stuffing the legal text in the software and adding a little bit of weight <em>back in</em> for ergonomics’ sake leads one to regard it as a monument to all the devices along the development timeline that have led to this… last triumph. Or, it would have perhaps, had they not <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2018/02/apple-reports-first-quarter-results/">sold so many</a>.</p>

<p>One could argue that good execution of consumer electronic design means minimizing as much as possible the obstructions in the way of the user completing any given task, and the iPhone 8 Plus has surpassed the vast majority of these for myself — and I am, surely, a “power user.” iOS has changed a lot in the decade I’ve employed it — in far too many ways for the worse — but this pair of handset and software have reached <em>my</em> imagination’s limit for what I could possibly want to do. Augmented reality and wireless charging won’t ever have a place in my future, for better or worse. Face ID is much too peculiar. Surely, this iPhone is the ultimate expression of the first and fourth generation’s foundation.</p>

<p>If the 6S Plus was indeed the key to my immortality, I’m afraid the 8 Plus heralds my imminent demise. Whether or not it’s an early one is for you to decide. This <em>really is</em> my last iPhone.</p>

<div lang="en" dir="ltr" class="book e-content"><p><img src="https://i.snap.as/DlQZXor.jpg" alt="HP Spectre x360"/></p>

<h2 id="a-laptop-purchased-the-beginning-of-a-new-era-finally-witnessed">A laptop, purchased. The beginning of a new era, finally witnessed.</h2>

<p><em>I managed to be reckless, tedious, and zealous in the usually-dry process of purchasing a new laptop, and found the story worth sharing. Expect a full review of the HP Spectre in the coming weeks.</em></p>

<p>The meteorological complaints you’ve been hearing from mid-Missouri since Friday aren’t inappropriate this time – the middlefolk faced one of their most fatal enemies – a well-laid minefield of black ice. It slowed our timid, ABS-oblivious society to ten percent or less of its already near-postmortem pace.</p>

<p><em>For God’s sake, at least learn <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20161224044948/http://auto.howstuffworks.com/auto-parts/brakes/brake-types/anti-lock-brake.htm">why you needn’t pump your brakes </a>before you opt for infotainment extras or… get your driver’s license.</em></p>

<p>I woke up with the same debt and imminent expenses as I did the day before and without any more intention of buying a premium laptop than I’ve had for the two years I’ve gone <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20161224044948/http://www.extratone.com/tech/ios10/">without one</a>.</p>

<p>Without the concept of mobile computing in its entirety, actually. I knew I’d lost my desire to carry a loose bluetooth keyboard around everywhere in case some insight were to fall upon me heavy enough to justify reaching for it over my 6S Plus in a public venue, hunched and squinting. There’s still nothing better at cranking out copy than the Lap Top Computer, I suppose. I was holding out for a truly-substantial alternative to Windows 10 and macOS, wanting to be enchanted by lite delights like Acer’s cheeky Chromebook R11, but had decided in self-pity that I’d probably never be able to stand a new operating system ever again.</p>

<p>My mom graciously decided to take me mall shopping for Christmas, which is comforting in its tradition of vapid routine. The state of a given midwestern metropolis’s mall is a keen indicator of the culture’s soul, I’ve found, and ours is mostly crewed by destitute alcoholics, who are my closest kin, and therefore my most appropriate company for <em>the holidays</em>.</p>

<p><strong>Dillard’s is the second-best place to lose your mind in America.</strong></p>

<p>Even now, when the somber corners are not quite so desolate. The acoustic sensation cannot be experienced anywhere else – the battlecries of the Me Generation’s pop reproduced by hateful diaphragms behind their white plastic ceiling facades and absorbed again by palletloads of mass-manufactured stonewashed denim, seemingly coming from a far-off wholesale nether no matter where in the store you’ve been buried. Ours is a few decades old, now – weathered and alone, which accentuates the whole dystopia with a resolute air of infinity, as if it’s certain it will outlast me. It probably will.</p>

<p><img src="https://i.snap.as/ggT8UR5.jpg" alt="HP Spectre x360"/></p>

<p>I was deep within it all when I came across Dan Seifert’s <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20161224044948/http://www.theverge.com/2016/12/12/13914962/hp-spectre-x360-review-2016-laptop">praising review</a> of the HP Spectre x360. As I’ve constantly confessed, <em>The Verge</em>‘s lot are the only institution of their kind I’ve come close to trusting <em>too much</em>, so it was no small thing to see something so certain as “the premium laptop to buy this year” in his subhead.</p>

<p>The last time I was in the market for a laptop, there was little room for aesthetics in the equation. We have been taught this past decade that beautiful devices come in fruit form, only. Somehow, I allowed myself to integrate the ridiculous sentiment that MacBooks were the only option for anyone with any reverence for tactile experience. As I expect you’re aware of to at least some degree by now, Apple’s diligent study of desirability over the years is the singular force behind their lordship, and it’s the token MO of tech opinion to confuse it with sex appeal, resulting in expressions like “[apple hardware device] is sexy,” which is a pityingly desperate delusion. Do you actually find brushed aluminum appealing in any bodily sense?</p>

<p>We did once, of course. Your infatuation with the stuff probably peaked the moment you first grazed it, and – if you’re anything like me – you could be harboring more aesthetic frustration with their longstanding occupation than you think. Infatuation must be starved to survive, and we’ve been eating up Apples by the bushel for a decade.</p>

<p>Haha.</p>

<p>But really, though – by the <em>billion</em>.</p>

<p>I saw images in that Spectre review which I was completely satisfied with. I watched that new HP logo as it traveled through the frames, stupefied. Out of precious ignorance, I experienced real desire in that undesirable place. (Which could actually represent some sort of defeat on my part, but I’m not too bothered.)</p>

<p><img src="https://i.snap.as/wcEdRy2.jpg" alt="HP Spectre x360"/></p>

<p>And in the midst of those desolate people in their fortress of mediocrity, my mom and I hatched a plan to indulge upon the best part of desolation – impulsive, subsidized gluttony. We’d stop by the pharmacy to fill my anti-depressant script before renavigating Bourgeois Bumper Cars to get to Best Buy, where she’d let me use her credit line to purchase my final choice in the segment.</p>

<p><strong>Best Buy is the best place to lose your mind in America.</strong></p>

<p>I could’ve sworn it made good sense to me, once – in Middle School, when my friend and I were spending most of our free time emulating the first generation of tech-reviewing YouTubers – but now, it reminds me of a darkwood restaurant with its closing fluorescents on, shining in the inverse frequency of a bug zapper – casting a more effectively-repelling ambiance for the human psyche than anything else <em>I’m</em> capable of dreaming up, at least.</p>

<p>I used to fucking <em>visit</em> that store for no purpose but to see and experience the diluted bit of the handset renaissance with enough momentum to coast its way here. I probably spent a full sixty minutes wandering around by my own volition on a handful of occasions.</p>

<p>But these days, I am perturbed from the onset in a big way. There are too many blue vape enthusiasts on the sales floor at any given time, and they all want me to leave. They loaf around the carcass of consumer technology’s passion, not realizing, I guess, that I already know it ’twas they who killed it. (The stench is strongest by the wearables.) It’s eerie how little the Big Box itself has changed, considering the decade their goods have traveled.</p>

<p>Under a fittingly-gray sky, I wash my pill down with La Croix and a Kind bar to preempt the appropriate rumination in my mouth as we inch toward my Final Financial Doom with the spooked sliders. Though we never exceed 5mph, there are abandoned vehicles littering the shoulders and medians in varyingly absurd orientations. But I do not jest – today, I am silent, for I am one of them.</p>

<p>By the time we reach the store, my medicine has once again placed my soul in Safe Mode, so we shuffle into the grotesque thing. There are four employees in sight – no one else – and they all send their beady eyes my way. I have too much purpose in my consumerist jowls to pause, though, so I rush to the laptops near the opposite wall in an attempt to get an early estimate on my current level of personal computing idiocy. Naturally, my Mom snags one of another four associates immediately. In this work, I shall refer to him as Zoroaster.</p>

<p><img src="https://i.snap.as/pCbk7GB.jpg" alt="HP Spectre x360"/></p>

<p>Despite having never seen 80% of the displayed devices in person before, I am able to spot the Spectres quickly, which is a good sign. I am immediately elated by the contrast to the depressing mushbooks I remember HP making in the oughts. The bezel… the brilliance of the display… the details of the visible body. I open <em>Extratone</em>. I open <em>The Verge</em>. I am hoping that Windows 10 will not be as much of a kicker as I’ve expected.</p>

<p>I’m not a minute before Mom and Zoroaster have found the new MacBook Pros. Nobody remembers the password to the 13-inch, but the 15 is showing off its “deep blacks” and “Space Gray” mood. The Verge looks phenomenal, and its icon in the touchbar catches my eye. I manage to use it to switch tabs, the less-attuned degenerate in me noting the extra spanning required over CMD-TAB.</p>

<p>“Have you tried the new keyboard?” asks Zoroaster.</p>

<p>I hadn’t. It’s as indescribable as you’ve heard, but suggests legitimacy is Apple’s effort to bridge the transition from physical keyboards to their touch replacement. Terrifying legitimacy.</p>

<p>“You get used to it,” he says.</p>

<p>I open Pages and click out something ridiculous. Yeah… <em>click</em>. I’m sure there’s a better onomatopoeia available by way of just about any technology website, but I didn’t bother to study the sensation after realizing that it’s a con for my number one use of a Portable Computer – <strong><em>clacking</em></strong>.</p>

<p>It’s not as if the thing isn’t gorgeous, though, in its way. After years of usership, I can tell you that it is undoubtedly a superb execution of the MacBook marque. It’s polished. It’s The New One. But it is also bleak and slateish. Some might even say <em>dystopian</em>. Do I want to carry such a thing around with me everywhere? Do I even want to carry it <em>out of the store?</em> What will I tell my friends? <em>What will I tell my staff?</em></p>

<p>$2,000 of my future spent on what is now a piece of <em>distinctly</em> establishment design…</p>

<p>I return to the x360 to see what can be done about Windows’ appearance these days.</p>

<p><em>Purple-gray taskbars… Hm.</em></p>

<p><strong>It’s a sale.</strong></p>

<p>Let me be honest with you – I spent some ninety minutes going between the two. Even if I’d endured the shame and self-disappointment of choosing the MacBook Pro, the simple grunt of the <em>challenge</em> the Spectre presents to it is no small milestone.</p>

<p>As Zoroaster scrambles to remove my new machine from <em>The Hanging Jail</em>, I am drained from the decision, but aware that my perspective on the world has changed. I’ve been working on an editorial for the past few weeks that’s mostly alarmed howling about the industry’s utter lack of passion, as of late, but seeing the Windows-running department’s devices and their matured design – <em>finally</em> beautiful without obvious Apple influence – had truly revived some little flame of hope within me.</p>

<p>Lithe Zoroaster was confused by UPCs a bit, as is understandable, and began juggling three Spectre boxes atop the prison lift, screaming the numbers – one at a time from each device – to his bewildered disciple, below.</p>

<p>Throughout the later half of the whole ordeal, I’d had company – some sort of blonde working man who’d also braved the frictionless waste to calm himself with debt. I’d been elated at the opportunity for companionship, at first, but he’d found himself unable to escape the store’s bespoke Apple Hole. I did my best to help him, but failed hoist his girth from the 15’s benchmark suction. I’d left him there, bound. May my dreams n’er be haunted by the fading portrait of his tortured, middle class face.</p>

<p>As the Best Boys did their dance, he somberly came to my side. The grimace he’d worn in the struggle had fallen away. I knew what was coming before he formed the defeated words: “go ahead and grab me the 500 while you’re up there.”</p>

<p>As one does when they stumble upon a stranger’s funeral, I bowed my head.</p>

<p>Here begins the part that sorta makes me look like an idiot.</p>

<p>After signing my mother’s lengthy loan agreement, Zoroaster – the little devil – asked if I wanted the <em>Special Edition</em>, just behind me. I’d stopped by last year’s Big Boy Spectre – the ballsy-ass copper-toned masterpiece – and had wished for a moment that the look could’ve carried to the fresher x360.</p>

<p>The monospace Hewlett-Packard logo blinded me, and the unlit display (it hadn’t been set up yet) concealed the wider bezel of… The older Spectre 13t – with which I write, now.</p>

<p>I didn’t notice my blunder until after our treacherous return, and could not care less.</p>

<p><audio controls="">
  <source src="https://github.com/extratone/bilge/raw/main/audio/Mono.mp3">
</audio></p>

<p>Though I have many audiophilical sentiments and preferences, I cannot — by conscience — fully claim the title because I’ve never been able to justify the allotment of funds necessary for the obligatory equipment. (And my digital compressor usage in the production of <a href="http://extratone.com/drycast"><em>Drycast</em></a> and <a href="http://extratone.com/futureland"><em>Futureland</em></a> has been manifestly vulgar.) That said, audio engineering is one of the few topics which I can actually speak on with almost-academic authority, and my pretentiousness-capacitated preoccupation with quality-of-life compels me to bring up a ludicrously-rational standard that most of us have continued to undershoot for far too long.</p>

<p>Two weeks ago, the abundantly-rumored omission of the 3.5mm audio port in the iPhone 7 was finally settled. We played our own part in feeding the “controversy,” yeah, but I believe Apple was actually quite tardy in labeling smartphone-bound analog audio as archaic, though I’m not going to waste words in that discussion — it is definitely oversaturated, at this point — because I think mono audio is an even more prevalent topic.</p>

<p>Honestly, out of all the missing features we’ve lamented over in the past decade, stereo speakers should’ve been the most aggravating. The gigantic difference, of course, is that the industry (and — by muddled extension — the consumers) has been all but silent in that regard. I write you, now, because we should all be colossally disappointed with ourselves.</p>

<p>Two channels. Left and right. Read: <a href="http://www.diffen.com/difference/Mono_vs_Stereo">Mono vs. Stereo</a> But why should you care? What if Google — somehow — failed to provide you with a significant difference?</p>

<p>One channel of sound is — in terms of locale — rigidly static in your perception. Doubling the data creates a spectrum, adding <strong>dimensionality</strong>, which is infinite, ya know. Playing back audio in stereo, through two or more diaphragms (the fundamental hardware unit of sound reproduction,) now enables the exhibition of <strong>audio pictures</strong>.</p>

<p>If this is entirely new to you, I want you to do something. Find yourself a pair of headphones or a set of two or more computer speakers. (If these aren’t available, consider your car’s sound system. If it’s at all current and healthy, it’s gonna do the trick.) Bother to discover “<strong>L</strong>” and “<strong>R</strong>.” That is, left and right. Orient accordingly. Download <a href="http://www.extratone.com/media/bikefest2016preview.wav">this 37-second clip</a> I recorded at <a href="http://www.extratone.com/audio/bikefest/">BikeFest</a> with my Zoom H2n. (Be advised: the preview is formatted in 5.1 surround, so it’s a very large file for its playback length.) Listen, obviously, and then listen again on your singular smartphone “loudspeaker.”</p>

<p><strong>That’s what I’m talking about.</strong></p>

<p>Why am I being so abashedly patronizing? Why am I transgressing against our particular assumptions about you — the informed, savvy millennial audience? Because the vast majority of playback I hear in day-to-day life is still from a singular diaphragm; a singular source.</p>

<p>A topical example: <em>I am shown a YouTube video on an iPhone</em>. (A pre-iPhone 7 device, that is.)</p>

<p><em>Walking downtown, I pass a small band of adolescent skateboarders listening to Cannibal Ox on a Samsung Galaxy Note.</em></p>

<p>Worst of all: <em>I find myself watching a Netflix film on my iPhone, in bed, not having bothered to wear the $200 pair of QC15s sitting within arm’s length.</em></p>

<p>Informed or not, <strong>consumers are neglecting audio</strong>, and dimensionality, alone is worth a change. Recent years have allowed the unlimited bandwidth assumption to become habit, so even the vast majority of today’s spoken word programs (like podcasts) — which, in general, stay in the “center” of their mix, making little to no use of the left-right spectrum — are produced in stereo, now. In many cases (including a few of ours,) this doublesizing is often for the sake of introductory themes, alone. If you care to imagine a more data-frugal society, the “waste” is ridiculous. It is not unrealistic to expect such a reality in the near future, but the same holds true for the reverse.</p>

<p>In the present’s abundance, though, the result is simply a decrease — as a whole — in playback’s “full experience,” if the hardware is not changed. Imagine how great it’d be if a digital audio formatting standard could be developed that’d enable a singular file to be mono or stereo, if needed/utilized, to trim off redundancy, sorta like variable bit rate. Get on that, would ya?</p>

<p>So, why haven’t we become more diligent about our sound experiences? 1 billion iPhones in circulation, all with mono playback by default, are suspect culprits, I think. Of course, there are other devices, but none as influential — even the iPod, funny enough — on fundamental digital functions like music playback. And honestly, when is it appropriate or suave to take the extra steps?</p>

<blockquote><p><em>I want to show you this song. Let me untangle my headphones… Yes, okay. Put them in. I’m going to sit here in silence for four minutes, looking into your eyes as you listen to the entirety of this track.</em></p></blockquote>

<p>It’s never going to be socially acceptable. But what about wireless alternatives? Apple’s new Air Pods look absurd, but their by-computing optimization of the Bluetooth audio standard is revolutionary, in a small way, in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/sep/25/hearables-iphone-7-airpods-bragi-the-dash-revolution">propelling</a> the “hearables” paradigm into the mainstream, if only for a moment. If — in a strangely-audiocentric future — we are <em>always</em> wearing multipurpose sound reproduction devices in our ears, perhaps the waste of the Mono Monstrosity will be finally resolved. Until then, I suppose all we can do is give it an extra thought, for our own quality-of-life’s sake.</p>
