      <title>3AM, Licking</title>

      <description>&lt;![CDATA[Licking Dark&#xA;&#xA;My girlfriend very generously offered to go for a drive with me yesterday evening, though neither of us particularly expected to end up parked at 5:40AM outside a little Diner called Ziggie’s some four hours away from home.

It’s smoother now, yet devoid of that pseudocountercultural sense in a design sense. Functionally, it is still the most reliable method of police detection I’ve ever encountered - in this Second Era of my Waze usage I have yet to see a single Missouri Highway Parol car sat in the center of I-70 that hadn’t been reported on Waze first - even at crazy hours on weekday mornings - which should be all the reassurance one needs regarding the immediate future of their userbase.&#xA;&#xA;Downtown Licking&#xA;&#xA;  I&#39;m using Waze to drive to to Licking, MO, arriving at 2:24.
