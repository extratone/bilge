- [ ] Tap top of screen to scroll to the top of a page.

- [ ] Spotlight search!

- [ ] Swipe up from the middle of the Lock screen to show notifications.

- [ ] Dynamically move the cursor by holding down on the space bar and then scrolling.

- [ ] “Share With App” in the Share Sheet.
> Kind of an odd one but if you go in the share sheet and hold an app, it’ll say “Share with app”. But I have yet to find a nifty use case for this since it seems to provide the exact same functionality as just tapping it.  

- [ ] “Suggest Less” (contacts) in Share Sheet.
> Also in the share sheet, though, you can tap and hold on a suggested contact which will bring up a “Suggest Less” option — which is obviously more useful in comparison.
