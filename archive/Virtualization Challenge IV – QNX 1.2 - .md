This is a Virtualization Challenge. A competition to virtualize an OS inside emulator/hypervisor. (Previously [1](https://virtuallyfun.com/wordpress/2015/08/09/venix86-challenge/) / [2 /](https://virtuallyfun.com/wordpress/2015/09/19/virtualization-challenge-ii/) [3](https://virtuallyfun.com/wordpress/2018/07/18/virtualization-challenge-iii-acorn-arm-minix/))

This time the object of the competition is **QNX version 1.2**. A demo disk is covered [here](https://virtuallyfun.com/wordpress/2020/10/05/qnx-1-1-demo-disk/). This is the set of floppy disks:

As you can see the boot disk is **copy-protected**. As such I have imaged these disks using both [KryoFlux](https://www.kryoflux.com/) and [SuperCard Pro](https://www.cbmstuff.com/proddetail.php?prod=SCP). The magnetic flux stream images are [available here](http://tenox.pdp-11.ru/qnx/qnx1/). For verification I have converted the raw stream of the **demo disk** in to a sector image using [HFE tool](http://hxc2001.free.fr/floppy_drive_emulator/index.html#download). The converted disk boots and works correctly in an emulator. The demo disk can also help with analyzing the boot process since itâ€™s known to work.

The contest is to virtualize the OS, install it and provide a fully working hard disk image with the OS installed. Any emulator of your choice or method is acceptable as long as anyone can download and run it. The prize is **$100** via PayPal and of course the fame! ![ðŸ™‚](https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/svg/1f642.svg) The winner will be whoever **comments the article first** with a verifiable working solution.

A bonus **$50** prize will be awarded if you can patch the boot floppy disk so that it can be installed as if the copy protection was never there.

Good luck!!!
