# When Weâ€™ll Never Forget

![Meagan Memory](https://i.snap.as/ZwFILs0.jpeg)

we have watched ourselves closely,
most of our lives for the first time.

records kept,
exponentially clarified.

I will be immortal.

*doubling*,
said Moore,
but not what,
or what for.

give me any date,
and I'll tell you what I said,
then,
but not always who I was.

notably - just about anything;
begun on my last priority

notably - not whom or how I've loved.

I've said and say words;
too many, maybe

not a one need leave me,
*ever*

blessed,
an accumulate film of noise.
there to wash,
and me knows how.

but if I do,
then who is left?
less the weight
