Well, where do we start with this Android device? Probably the most leaked handset in existence, the Sony Ericsson Xperia Play received its fair share of publicitybefore its official unveiling at this year’s Mobile World Congress event. This week devices have started making their way to reviewers across the UK.

Appealing to gamers, the Xperia Play fills a very specific niche. Will consumers want a smartphone that doubles as gaming handheld that can play PlayStation One games using its slide-out gaming control-pad? Is the PlayStation certification enough? Read on for our full review of the Sony Ericsson Xperia Play and find out.

Looking at the Xperia Play top-down you would be forgiven if you thought it was an Xperia X10 – Sony Ericsson’s Android smartphones have the same distinctive look – it’s only when you pick the device up that you realise that the smartphone is hiding away its centrepiece – a slide-out gamepad.

The sliding of the gamepad is smooth – the device resists forces that would reveal controls accidentally whilst remaining easy to open with a simple thumb-swipe. Once revealed, the gamepad sports a D-Pad, familiar PlayStation symbol buttons (triangle, square, circle andcross), a start and select button, with option key located on the bottom left of the pad, serving up ways to exit from and customise the gaming experience. On the outside of the device lie two “flipper” controls, similar to the L1 and R1 bumpers on a PlayStation controller.

Two touch analog controls are located in-between the D-Pad and the PlayStation buttons, complete with shallow dot in the centre, making it easy to locate and completing almost an exact replica of a PlayStation DualShock gamepad.

When in use, game controls work well – however, the touch-sensitive analog pads require a lot of practice and at times the D-Pad can be linear in its operation. When we played the FIFA 10, it became difficult to use the D-Pad to direct players diagonally, finding it equally difficult to keep our thumbs on the analog pads in certain games.

In an effort to outfit the Xperia Play with full PlayStation gaming controls and keep it as slim as possible, it feels like Sony Ericsson had to compromise on making them tactile enough to ensure the gaming experience is able to rival other gaming handhelds, including its own.

The build-quality of the device is sufficiently sturdy, Sony Ericsson utilising the same plastic finish on all handsets in the Xperia line. Coming in at double the thickness of the iPhone 4 and weighing over 40 grams more, the Xperia Play sits firmly in the small-gaming-device-large-smartphone category, a niche that is likely to appeal to a small consumer group, at least initially.

![](https://cdn0.tnwcdn.com/files/2011/04/DSCF1407wtmk-520x390.jpg)

Looking at the specifications, the Xperia Play is an unremarkable device. Featuring a 1GHz Snapdragon MSM8255 processor, 512MB RAM, front and back cameras and 400MB of internal storage, the handset would be lost in a market of dual-core smartphones if it was evaluated on its smartphone credentials alone.

Whether it is a lack of processing power or enabled by design, the Xperia Play booted significantly slower than an HTC Incredible S, with games requiring significant loading sequences before they became playable.

### Platform

The Xperia Play runs the latest Android Gingerbread operating system, launching as one of a limited number of devices on the market that currently features the software. Sony Ericsson executives have already committed to regularly updating the Android firmware on the Xperia Play, noting that engineers have successfully been able to “unbundle” Sony advancements and its customised user interface to quickly prepare updates when Google makes them available to the manufacturer.

The Xperia Play’s custom UI is simple to use but does operate significantly differently to the stock Gingerbread software – the sliding padlock to unlock the device is still present but is delivered in a similar fashion to the iPhone unlock process and navigating the apps requires you to scroll horizontally, another nod towards the functionality of iOS.

If you’re familiar with Timescape, it’s present on the newest Xperia models, offering the ability to tie in social updates. Additional widgets are available, including two that list a number of PlayStation pocket titles on the homescreen. Navigation is smooth and the Xperia Play’s customised stylings do not provide any noticeable lag when browsing the homescreens.

### Gaming

Sony Ericsson has done all it can to ensure the gaming elements on the Xperia Play are brought to the fore. For example, when the phone is unlocked and you open the gaming slider, the handset will automatically load the Xperia Play gaming dashboard, presenting the FIFA 10, Bruce Lee, Star Battalion and Sims 3. Other Android games are available to download via this dashboard, including popular titles from Gameloft, Handygames and Glu Mobile.

![](https://cdn0.tnwcdn.com/files/2011/04/DSCF1415wtmk-520x390.jpg)

As the world’s first PlayStation Certified smartphone, the Xperia Play also offers PlayStation One games to download and play on the device using the PlayStation Pocket app. Pre-loaded with Crash Bandicoot, you can also download Destruction Derby, Cool Boarders 2,  Jumping Flash, MediEvil and Syphon Filter, although finding and playing the games once they have been downloaded is a little more difficult than it needs to be.

With a PlayStation Pocket and dedicated Xperia Play gaming dashboard, you are required to select your Android and PS One games from different apps, with no unified dashboard. It’s understandable that Sony Ericsson would want to differentiate its PlayStation titles from generally available third-party Android applications but the experience is a tad more laborious than it needs to be.

Before the Xperia Play launched, a number of popular emulators were available on the Android Market, allowing Android users to download and play ROMs of their favourite Sega, Nintendo and Sony PlayStation games. We tested this briefly and were able to enjoy a few titles from yesteryear, although at the time of writing Sony has filed a request to remove the PSX4Droid app from the Android Market, removing the ability to download and play PS One ROMs. This is is understandable.

![](https://cdn0.tnwcdn.com/files/2011/04/DSCF1417wtmk-520x390.jpg)

Overall, the gaming experience is excellent; the Xperia Play has to stand out as a gaming device and that it does. No other smartphones are able to offer an experience close to what this Sony Ericsson device can deliver. Graphics are crisp, if not unspectacular, but then you have constantly remind yourself that this is an Android-powered smartphone, that takes calls and can multi-task, it’s not going to reproduce PS3-like graphics.

### Camera/Video

**Photos**

Sony Ericsson is revered for its build-quality, particularly in the camera department. With the Xperia Play’s 5MP rear facing camera, shots are clean and clear. It’s good at reproducing colour in well-lit environments, although sometimes shots are a little washed out.

The camera application uses the standard Gingerbread interface, making it easy to toggle between photo and video modes and view photos quickly once they have been taken.

![](https://cdn0.tnwcdn.com/files/2011/04/IMG_20110401_074205-520x390.jpg)

The Xperia Play doesn’t allow users to touch-to-focus, instead having to rely on auto-focus to get the best shots. Normally, this would pose a significant problem but the auto-focus feature copes admirably in a number of different environments.

**Video**

If you’re expecting the Xperia Play to capture high-quality video, you will be disappointed. With its WVGA resolution, the Xperia Play captures video at 30 frames-per-second, a far cry from the HD video that most modern smartphones are able to record.

### Battery Life

The battery life of the Xperia Play is very impressive, requiring one full charge over a 72 hour period during testing. With its 1500MAh lithium polymer batter, the device is slated to handle at least 8.5 hours of talk time and nearly 6 hours of gameplay. On standby, the device consumed minimal resources, providing us with more than enough battery to play FIFA 10 and Crash Bandicoot for lengthy periods.

### Call Quality

Sporting a powerful stereo loudspeaker, calls are crisp and clear on hands-free and during normal calls. Sporting dual noise cancelling microphones, calls are free from excess background noise, making the Xperia Play truly one of the best smartphones we have used based on call clarity.

### Conclusion

There are no doubts about it, this is the best gaming smartphone on the market. Physical pads, analog touch-pads and PlayStation buttons set the Xperia Play apart from any other device on any other platform. Whilst we had minor frustrations with the controls at times, the Xperia Play delivers a solid gaming experience with its slide-out gamepad.

Sony Ericsson’s smartphone falls short of the PSP Go and Nintendo DS, but as a niche device that sits between the smartphone and gaming handheld markets, it fulfils both its roles with ease.

If Sony Ericsson commits to making desirable titles available for the Xperia Play, it has a very good chance of succeeding. With 60 titles available as of today, it’s a good start for the platform that will get a much needed boost when the PlayStation Suite is released later in the year.

As the Android platform continues to gain in popularity, this added gaming twist could be the feature that tempts consumers to part with their cash and grab themselves one of these devices.

# Sony Ericsson Xperia Play

3.5 stars

Price when reviewed TBC

Quick verdict

As a smartphone the Xperia Play is reasonable enough and the gaming controls are great, however, the lack of really exciting games at launch is a little disappointing. Software and game development could turn this around, but in these early days, we'd wait a little longer

For

  * Gaming pad is well designed
  * Sony Ericsson's take on Android has some nice features and is easily compensated where it lacks features
  * Battery life when gaming is pretty good

Against

  * Gaming delivery is a little disparate
  * Screen needs to be brighter
  * It really needs some exciting gaming titles
  * Video capture is unnecessarily poor

(Pocket-lint) - The Sony Ericsson Xperia Play could be the stuff of legend: the Holy Grail of the PlayStation phone has been subject to rumour and speculation for many years. With the meteoric rise of mobile gaming, thanks largely to the [iPhone](/phones/reviews/apple/71882-apple-iphone-4-review), an Android device that grasps gaming literally with both hands was inevitable. But can the Xperia Play break into the mainstream in a way that the [PSP Go](/games/reviews/playstation/71493-sony-psp-go-console-review) failed to do?

The Xperia Play has curves and buttons in places that draw your eyes to them. It’s glossy, there are interesting angles and it’s definitely an interesting phone to look at. The Play follows some of the design lines laid down following Sony’s “human curvature” design we’ve seen before. The back of the phone is curved like the [Vivaz](/phones/reviews/sony-mobile/71690-sony-ericsson-vivaz-u5i-review) was, and the new [Xperia Neo](/sony-mobile) and [Pro](/sony-mobile) are. The aim is to make it sit naturally in the hand, but the real challenge here is to make it comfortable when held for gaming and for using as a regular phone. Yes, it is a comfortable device to make phone calls on and we had no problems with call quality in our tests.

Pocket-lint

It’s a hefty bit of kit, measuring 119 x 62 x 16mm, but to be fair, it packs a gaming controller into the mix, so that 16mm of thickness isn’t excessive, only a little larger than similarly designed QWERTY phones. The Xperia Play slips comfortably into your pocket, ready for any-time gaming action, so it isn’t an issue. It weighs 175g, towards the top end of smartphones, but again, this is a phone with a difference.

The phone is dressed in plastics with a glossy finish, which not only attract fingerprints, but we also found various design points attracted duct or pocket-lint, especially along the top of the narrow line of four control buttons that arc across the bottom of the screen. Yes, making these touch controls would have been cleaner, but once you deploy this as a gaming device, physical buttons work better as touch buttons could be too easily brushed as you play those games.

We raised a slight concern about the location of the buttons on the Sony Ericsson Xperia Arc, as the back button lies too close to some of the on-screen options, so accidental presses were frequent. The Play doesn’t suffer from that problem to the same degree, but we did on occasion find ourselves archiving Gmail messages when we intended to go back to our message list.

Pocket-lint

The biggest nod to gaming from the “outside” of the Xperia Play is the two shoulder buttons, aping those you find on a PlayStation controller. The left and right buttons sit either side of a central volume control. Up to this point, apart from those shoulder buttons, this could have been a QWERTY slider, and we’re sure there will be some who think it is at first glance. Slide it open and the Play reveals its true purpose.

The PlayStation Certified logo sits in the bottom left-hand corner. It’s a subtle mark, not detracting from the central XPERIA name as though Sony didn’t want to run away with Ericsson’s glory. Not that there could be any confusion when you look at the layout of controls, the four distinctive controller buttons on the right hand-side leave you with no doubt that you’re holding the PlayStation phone. Start and Select make an appearance along with a menu button so you don’t have to reach around the side to the menu button beneath the screen. The four-way pad sits to the left and centrally you have two analogue touch pads.

The gaming deck isn’t showy or adorned with bright colours: it’s metal grey, sophisticated and somewhat understated. The flat profile of the buttons looks excellent, but markedly different from the typical Sony Ericsson buttons on the “outside” of the Play, so some might say that the Xperia Play isn’t the most cohesively designed.

The power/standby button sits on the top, which falls under the left hand when in gaming mode. It sits flush with the bodywork which it needs too - otherwise you’d press it when you gripped the Play in the throws of gaming. That said, we have put it into standby mid-game, but it’s good that you can suspend gaming easily - in fact it’s critical for a mobile gaming device where you might want to jump in and out of games.

Power the Xperia Play on and you are greeted with Android 2.3.2, lightly skinned with Sony Ericsson’s take on Android. It isn’t the most aggressive customisation we’ve seen and we like that fact. As normal you are presented with a number of customisable homepages and Sony Ericsson provide a range of widgets. Some of these are pretty lightweight - their calendar widget is essentially useless and there is no sign of things like weather. However, you will add widgets as you expand the apps you have on the phone, so there is always the chance to add more regular Android widgets as and when you see fit.

There are, however, a couple of unique widgets specifically for the gaming remit of this device. The first is a PlayStation Pocket widget (there are large and small versions) that let you launch your PlayStation Pocket games directly, or open the PlayStation Pocket app. Crash Bandicoot, the 1996 PlayStation port, comes pre-loaded on the device and so occupies this space alone unless you head off online to buy more, such as CoolBoarders 2 or Syphon Filter. The second gaming widget is a link to the Get Game app, which offers up a selection of titles designed for the Xperia Play. 

Otherwise the skin that Sony Ericsson have applied to the Xperia Play is essentially the same as it is on the Xperia Arc. It isn’t as all-encompassing as something like HTC Sense, but offers tweaks at many levels, from contacts to the settings menu. We actually like the lighter touch that Sony Ericsson have applied, and like LG and Samsung, it gives you the feeling that you have slightly more freedom to do everything exactly as you wish.

Pocket-lint

Some of the smart moves aren’t immediately obvious, like the fact that you can add a folder to the dock at the foot of the homepages and call it whatever you like. So, for example, you could create a “Social” folder and dump Twitter, Facebook and Foursquare in there, which makes it a good way to give you instant access to your favourite apps. Of course, you can always dump apps, shortcuts and contacts onto the homepages in a flash. 

You also get a widget for Sony Ericsson’s Timescape application. This is SE’s take on social networking, looking to pull in updates from Twitter and Facebook and run them into your SMS messages to create a tiled stream of social consciousness. We’ve never been totally sold on the execution of Timescape (although it works here better than it did on the previous generation of Sony Ericsson devices), as you can only really ever see one “tile” at a time, whereas if you use a regular app like Twitter for Android, you’d be able to see perhaps five. On top of that, Timescape only really regurgitates this social activity, it doesn’t want to fully join in, so if you want to post photos to a specific gallery in Facebook or Check In on Places, you’ll need the fully featured app.

But if you don’t like Timescape you can safely ignore it and you’ll find that Android weaves it’s normal magic to integrate your contacts so you’ll get a full featured address book regardless of whether you take advantage of the Sony Ericsson applications or not. The contact book perhaps isn’t the cleanest iteration of an Android address book, with a slight oddity splitting of SMS/MMS messaging into a envelope icon and everything else from the listed numbers, but it’s a minor point.

Being an up-to-date Android phone you get all the benefits of the Android Market with its growing and increasingly competitive offering. That includes the likes of Adobe Flash 10.2 support, so you’ll be able to snack on a more complete internet offering than some lesser rivals. In that regard, the Xperia Play has a relatively unfettered Android browser, which offers swift and slick navigation - and as always with Android, if you don’t like it you can opt for Firefox, Opera, Skyfire or Dolphin if you prefer.

Android 2.3 also brings with it a new native keyboard however you won’t see it on the Xperia Play, which uses Sony Ericsson’s take on keyboards. It’s ok, but not the smartest, doing its bit to offer up suggestions but not really able to correct typos to the same degree that the HTC keyboard will, or predict what you’re writing like the excellent SwiftKey keyboard will - of course you can always download that instead. Annoyingly the keyboard alternate character key is right next to the keyboard close button, so we found ourselves closing the keyboard by mistake on a number of occasions, especially when typing in portrait. The landscape keyboard is obviously larger, but you then find yourself gripping the bulk of the phone, so takes some getting used to.

Pocket-lint

In many places the Android Market will swing in and enable you to alter the core phone offering to your liking and that’s both one of the strengths of Android and one of the things that makes the Xperia Play work as a device - you can pretty much get it to do anything you want. Some areas aren’t the best, like the video format support, or the lack of a network streaming client out of the box, but there is usually an easy (and free) solution waiting to help you out. The music player, for example, is pretty dull, and we can’t help thinking that Sony Ericsson could have done more to support these media features better - this is, after all, a phone that it all about entertainment.

The experience is close to that of the Xperia Arc when it comes to performance, but one significant difference (outside of the drastically different form factor) is the screen. We’re quite taken with the Xperia Arc screen, and the benefits that the Mobile Bravia Engine processing seems to apply. It’s a shame that the 4-inch 854 x 480 display found on the Play isn’t quite as adept as the 4.2-inch display on the Arc. It is vibrant enough, even if the whites are a little yellow, but it seems to lack brightness overall. This is something of a problem if you plan to be playing games next to the pool, or just sat at the back of the bus. The screen really needs to be brighter to cope with gaming in brighter conditions and that’s a serious drawback for a device designed to be so visually engaging.

Under the bonnet the Xperia Play isn’t the most powerful phone around. It packs in a 1GHz Qualcomm Snapdragon MSM 8255 processor backed by 512MB RAM, the same as the Xperia Arc and the experience is comparable for the most part. The phone is relatively swift in navigation and is mercifully lag free moving around the homepages. It isn’t however, going to compete with the raw power of the likes of the [LG Optimus 2X](/phones/reviews/lg/72259-lg-optimus-2x-full-review), the showcase device for the Nvidia Tegra 2 chipset, which also has gaming firmly in its sights. Remember that mobile gaming was driven to this point today mostly by touchscreen gaming. The Xperia Play is really going to have to deliver games to garner attention from it’s slightly overshadowed hardware position.

We’ve already looked at game delivery to some degree [here](/games/news/playstation/109408-sony-ericsson-xperia-play-games), but for the sake of completeness, we’ll cover it again here. To offer up your games, the Xperia Play comes with a number of different apps, which is a little confusing. Slide open the handset and the Xperia Play Launcher app opens. This offers up some of your games, with nice big icons so you can launch them directly and get right to the fun. It also offers a link through to the Android Market where you can buy from a selection of “Xperia Play Optimized” games.

The second method of game delivery is through an app called Get Games. This is essentially a list which offers up the same Xperia Play Optimized titles from Android Market, as well as some others. Select the title you want and you’ll be taken to the appropriate point of purchase - so far we’ve seen games from Android Market and from Gameloft’s portal (Asphalt 6: Adrenaline is being offered as a free download from Gameloft, to ease you in). Sony Ericsson tell us that there are [60 titles designed for Xperia Play](/phones/news/sony-mobile/109461-sony-ericsson-xperia-play-onsale) at launch, but most you’ll have seen before, and many you may already own. The difference will be that they may have had the controls altered to suit the gaming buttons on offer. We’ve been playing Asphalt 6 and Assassin’s Creed and found this to be the case, but some versions we’ve played so far, like Splinter Cell: Conviction, still had the original touch controls on the screen. Gameloft tell us that this won’t be the case forever, so we can expect cleaner adaption in the future.

But there is a third area for game delivery too. This is the PlayStation Pocket app which looks to serve up PlayStation classics: Crash Bandicoot is the title we’ve heard about since the launch of the Xperia Play in February. Crash Bandicoot comes preinstalled and sits all on it’s lonesome in the PlayStation Pocket app, ready for some retro platforming action. If you want more, you’ll have to buy these titles (again delivered through Android Market) and the list currently includes: Cool Boarders 2, Destruction Derby, Jumping Flash, MediEvil and Syphon Filter.

Gameloft have already told us that their exclusive Xperia Play title [BackStab](/games/buyers-guides/131744-best-ps4-games-the-top-playstation-games-to-play-now) is coming, but really, we’d want that on day one - preloaded. We’d always said that the Xperia Play was going to hang on the selection and delivery of games. Crash Bandicoot is great, but it isn’t Metal Gear Solid or Tekken is it? The lack of exclusivity is a little disappointing and it’s at this point that you have to remember that this is a mobile phone with a penchant for gaming: it isn’t the next generation PSP.

At least the games are relatively affordable and you get the full selection of Android games too, such as Angry Birds, although if that’s your definition of mobile gaming, there is no benefit to having the Xperia Play. One area that does bring an aspect of exclusivity is online play, although we've yet to see what this really delivers yet. You'll be able to host local multiplayer games, as well as play online if the game allows it. We can see the opportunity for a cult multiplayer game, but do you back Sony Ericsson or the Nintendo 3DS to deliver it?

What does work though is the ergonomics. The layout and the action of the gaming controls feels right. Start playing the included Bruce Lee: Dragon Master and you’ll be doing things that you couldn’t feasibly do without those game controls. When not gaming, those game controls will also let you navigate around pages, so you can flick down a website and hit the X button to follow a link for example. 

Those with larger hands might struggle to get to grips with the Xperia Play gaming controls, but you’ll get used to bending that thumb just like you had to on the PSP, or a BlackBerry keyboard for that matter. The shoulder buttons work pretty well too, and the centrally located volume control can be reached if you need to make adjustments on the fly. The location of the charger socket and headphone jack on the left-hand side of the device also mean that both are out of the way if you want to play plugged in.

The battery life is surprisingly good for gaming. We put it to the test and reached nearly 6 and a half hours of pretty much straight gaming ([you can read all about it here](/phones/reviews/sony-mobile/72348-sony-ericsson-xperia-play)). Outside of gaming, using the Xperia Play as a regular smartphone, we’ve found that we’ve got through an average day with problems. You’ll be charging it every night, but you would with any other device of this ilk too. We suspect this performance partly comes down to the more efficient version of Android, the lower brightness of the screen, the 1500mAh battery and the restrained hardware. We also have a suspicion that if the Xperia Play was a power house you’d find the battery life was cut dramatically. 

Around the back of the Play you’ll find a 5.1-megapixel camera. This is, excuse the expression, bog standard in many ways. Where Sony Ericsson have lavished attention on the Xperia Arc camera, with its backlit Exmor R sensor and more advanced interface, the Xperia Play finds itself with a straight Android camera interface. Why the disparity? Sony Ericsson have for a long time differentiated between devices on hardware and functions and even though they promised “entertainment unlimited” back in 2009, it seems that the Xperia Play gets marked down in the camera department. This is a gaming phone remember, you’re only interested in gaming, right?

Ironically, the Android camera offers a macro shooting mode, so we got more consistent macro shooting from the Play than we did from the Arc. The results, naturally, aren’t as good as you’ll get from the Arc, but they are just about average for a 5-megapixel Android smartphone. An LED “flash” offers support in darker conditions, but isn’t especially effective.

In a strange move, the video capture on the Xperia Play isn’t HD like the other Android phones we’ve seen of late. Instead, the “high quality” settings only offer you 800 x 480 pixels at 30fps. This might be alright for casual use and looks acceptable on the phone, but in this day and age of YouTube HD, you’d want to take advantage of higher settings. As a result, the video capture can only be described as disappointing. 

Video capture, and the camera interface, is something that could easily be corrected with a software update and hopefully Sony Ericsson will make a move to spice things up a little bit. We were told that the device we were testing was final retail software, but we’re still a little suspicious of the occasional crashes we experienced, especially when it came to accessing Android Market. It wasn’t anything critical, but happened often enough to make us wonder if there was a problem.

> “Unless the bulk bothers you, the sacrifices made for hard game controls are quite livable, making the Sony Ericsson Xperia Play a worthy consideration for smartphones gamers sick of swiping at glass.” 

  * Slide-out game controller 
  * Clean Android install 
  * Vibrant 4.0-inch LCD 
  * Attractive Sony styling 
  * Acceptable 5.1-megapixel camera 
  * Bulky design 
  * Controls work with limited game selection 
  * Touch-based analog controls 
  * No 4G 
  * Smudgy screen 

What do you get when you breed a portable game console with a smartphone? Sony Ericsson’s new Xperia Play — the long-rumored “[PlayStation phone](https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/imagining-sonys-playstation-phone-what-it-needs-to-succeed/)” that combines the slide-out gamepad of [Sony’s PSP Go](https://www.digitaltrends.com/game-console-reviews/sony-psp-go-review/) with all the functionality of a modern Android smartphone. But can productivity and mindless button mashing really coexist under the same piece of glass? We worked our tender thumbs to blisters to find out whether Sony’s attempt to satiate hardcore gamers with a phone hits a new high score or uses up yet another of Sony’s dwindling lives.

### Features and design

If Sony Ericsson’s first design objective for a PlayStation phone was making it subtle enough to pass for _just a phone_, consider that box checked. From the outside, there just isn’t much to signal that Sony’s firecracker handheld is anything more than just another Android device. Witness: gloss black body, four standard Android buttons below the 4.0-inch LCD, and not even a hint of PlayStation branding — you actually get Sony Ericsson’s green globe logo instead.

Slide the two halves apart, though, and it’s a different story. Rather than the typical slide-out QWERTY keyboard, the Xperia Play packs the familiar PlayStation square-cross-circle-triangle pad on the right, a hard directional pad on the left, and two touch-based analog controllers in the middle. You’ll also find start and select buttons on the bottom, and in a nod to Android, the same three-lined menu button found on the face. In short, Sony has spliced the controls from the PSP Go into a handset.

![Sony Ericsson Xperia Play screen open controls](https://icdn.digitaltrends.com/image/digitaltrends/sony-ericsson-xperia-play-screen-controls-500x500.jpg)Oh, and maybe you didn’t’ catch that subtle L and R stamped onto discrete pads on the right side of the phone. Shoulder buttons. There’s also a standard volume rocker between them and, on the flip side, a microUSB port and a headphone jack. The power button takes its usual place up top, with a small red LED built in as an indicator.

As either a phone or a portable game console, the Xperia Play feels beefy. At 0.6 inches thick and 6.2 ounces, it’s substantially thicker and heavier than most competing [Android phones](https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/the-best-android-phones/) of this generation, thanks mainly to the sliding form factor. The chunkiness turns out to be an advantage for gaming, where it feels comfortable and solid in the hands, but as a phone you’ll still wish there weren’t a game pad hiding inside.

Less intriguing phone specs also include 854 x 480 pixel resolution in the 4.0-inch LCD screen, a 5.1-megapixel rear camera that shoots 720p video and a VGA front cam for video conferencing. The Play supports microSD cards up to 32GB, and comes with a 8GB card preinstalled. Without features like HDMI output, an OLED screen or 4G connectivity, it certainly doesn’t rival many competitors on spec sheets, but that’s not where the Xperia Play was built to shine.

### Software

For a device that aspires to effectively merge two entirely disparate devices, the Android 2.3 install on the Xperia Play is surprisingly pedestrian at first glance. There’s a purple Xperia background, but no goofy new clocks, widget or other overt cues that this is a gaming device… until you slide it open. Gamepad glaring to all the world, the Xperia Play switches into a landscape gaming mode (via an app), bringing up a carousel of games to thumb through with the D-pad. Hit X on one to run and you’re gaming, no touchscreen tomfoolery necessary.

The Verizon version of the Xperia comes with six games preinstalled: _Asphalt 6_,_ Bruce Lee_, _Crash Bandicoot_, _Gun Bros_, _Madden NFL 11_, _Tetris _and _Star Battalion_. Sony claims there are plenty more titles coming, including additional PlayStation ports, but the Xperia launcher, at press time, only showed 21.

![Sony Ericsson Xperia Play screen angle open](https://icdn.digitaltrends.com/image/digitaltrends/sony-ericsson-xperia-play-screen-angle-open-400x0.jpg)Although the Xperia Play has access to the standard Google Marketplace, clicking on any available from the game-centric menu directs you directly to V Cast Apps for purchases, which appear on your Verizon bill. We’re not necessarily opposed to Verizon’s carefully groomed app store as an alternative to Google’s, but Sony’s launcher should offer a choice. Verizon’s interface is less intuitive and, as it turns out, the prices are jacked up, too. In some cases, it’s possible to get the exact same Xperia Play titles from Google for less, but because Sony has configured the launcher to use Verizon, you’ll need to do the legwork yourself.

The phone also comes preloaded with My Verizon Mobile, VZ Navigator, Skype Mobile, and OfficeSuite. As usual, you can’t uninstall any of them.

### Gaming on the Xperia Play

From first-person shooters to Brickbreaker clones, there are plenty of games that just don’t lend themselves to touch screens — which is where the Xperia Play’s time-tested control scheme comes in. Even on games already available for other Android phones, the Play promises to make them more precise, more familiar, and more fun.

In some regards, it succeeds. Playing Modern Combat 2, a shameless Call of Duty clone, just felt more natural with the Play’s controls. You can strafe with the D-pad, precisely aim with the right touchpad, and fire with the shoulder buttons. This is, quite literally, how games like this were meant to be played, before Steve Jobs went on a button-crushing crusade for the iPhone and convinced subsequent imitators that touchscreens were king.

Keep in mind that the analog controls – the ones you would use for smooth movement – aren’t hard nubs like they are on the PSP and even PSP Go. You’re just moving your finger around on flat plastic, like a laptop touchpad. It works better than nothing, but we missed the feedback of a tactile controller, especially in games where we used the pads frequently, like Star Battalion.

On other games, the controls are quite literally worthless. Tetris has been preloaded on the Play, but fire it up and you’ll have to slide away the controls, since the entire game is played with the phone held vertically. Keep in mind that most random Android games will fall into this category – unable to use the Play controls because they haven’t been coded for it.

![Sony Ericsson Xperia Play back camera](https://icdn.digitaltrends.com/image/digitaltrends/sony-ericsson-xperia-play-back-350x0.jpg)In many games, the Play controls work for some functions but not others, leaving you to tap the screen to navigate through menus but control characters with the pads — a frustrating split between interfaces that never leaves you feeling totally at home on either one. In some, the controls work within the game, but touching the screen just feels more appropriate. For instance, in The Sims 3, tapping a spot on the screen to make your Sim walk there is far easier than using a D-pad to crudely maneuver a circle to the spot, then tapping X.

You might expect any Android phone advertising its gaming prowess to pack some of the most powerful hardware on the market, but the 1GHz Snapdragon processor in the Xperia Play is actually fairly dated. Sony makes up for it with an onboard Andreno 205 GPU, which handles 3D competently enough to make every game on the device ruin as fluid as you would expect from a dedicated handheld game console.

### Camera

Sony’s 5.1-inch megapixel rear camera is, as with most devices in this class, adequate but unimpressive. It takes acceptable photos for a phone, but unlike some of the best smartphone cams we’ve seen, it doesn’t quite reach the level of image quality that would fool some folks into thinking you took your vacation photos with a dedicated point-and-shoot. Many photos had a yellowish cast, and even with the camera dead still, photos had a slightly foggy out-of-focus look that we could never quite shake.

Shooting video only exacerbated the focus problems. The camera also had trouble adjusting exposure in shots with mixed lighting, tending either to crush the blacks in the dark areas or blow out the whites in the light areas – a familiar problem but one that seemed to taint the Sony more than most. On the plus side, the lens offers a nice wide angle that’s great for indoor shots.

### ![Sony Ericsson Xperia Play screen](https://icdn.digitaltrends.com/image/digitaltrends/sony-ericsson-xperia-play-screen-300x0.jpg)Display

The 4.0-inch LCD on the Xperia Play deserves credit: It’s bright, colorful, and has a reasonable viewing angle, but trouble lurks on the surface — literally. Fingers seem to rub on the top glass rather than glide, it smudges more as a consequence, and the pinpoint grid used to enable touch sensitivity is clearly visible from certain angles. Sony might have been better off springing for Corning’s excellent Gorilla Glass rather than using in its own hardened mineral glass.

### Battery life

Sony rates the Xperia Play for 6.5 hours worth of talk time and 425 hours worth of standby from its 1500mAh battery – both of which our nonscientific testing seemed to bear out. Just remember the same battery now powers your portable game console, too. Firing up an intense 3D game at full brightness and losing yourself in combat for an hour will bite into battery life a lot more than swapping text messages and casually batting through websites. Even so, we had no issues surfing the Web through the day, downloading apps, hitting the asphalt in some games, and still having plenty of battery life left by the end of the day.

### Connectivity

Verizon is moving full speed ahead with LTE handsets like the Samsung Charge and HTC ThunderBolt, but Sony missed the boat and still tools along on 3G speeds. Speeds weren’t _bad_, per se – but the lack of 4G means potential buyers will have to choose between a gaming phone _or _a blazing fast phone, because it certainly isn’t both.

### Conclusion

If you want the most gaming-friendly Android phone, this is it. But don’t cancel your PSP Go purchase just yet. The first “PlayStation-certified” phone is only a handheld gaming console in the same way a bicycle with an engine bolted onto it is a motorcycle – the difference is all in the details. With compromised controls, a small library of available titles that work with them and sometimes lukewarm controller integration on the games that do, the Xperia Play has a ways to go before any real gamer would swap a PSP or [Nintendo DS](https://www.digitaltrends.com/game-console-reviews/nintendo-3ds-review/) for it. Even so, we have to give Sony Ericsson credit for adding game controls to an Android handset without destroying its credibility as a phone. Unless the bulk bothers you, the sacrifices made for hard game controls are quite livable, making the Xperia Play a worthy consideration for smartphones gamers sick of swiping at glass.

### Highs:

  * Slide-out game controller
  * Clean Android install
  * Vibrant 4.0-inch LCD
  * Attractive Sony styling
  * Acceptable 5.1-megapixel camera

### Lows:

  * Bulky design
  * Controls work with limited game selection
  * Touch-based analog controls
  * No 4G
  * Smudgy screen

# Review: Sony Ericsson Xperia Play | WIRED
 
05.29.11 9:00 AM![Image may contain: Electronics, Phone, Cell Phone, Mobile Phone, Human, and Person](https://media.wired.com/photos/59329d444cd5ce6f96c0aff3/master/w_660,h_440,c_limit/xperia-play1.jpg)

[Buy Now](http://www.sonyericsson.com/)

Mothers, lock up your gamers. The PlayStation phone has arrived.

And while it's a bit on the chubby side, we think that, for Sony Ericsson's Xperia Play, big is beautiful.

You could almost call the Xperia Play the shorter, fatter cousin to the [svelte Xperia Arc](https://www.wired.com/reviews/2011/05/xperia-arc/?intcid=inline_amp), which Sony Ericsson once described as the “world’s thinnest smartphone.” At .62 inches, the Play looks positively bulky compared to its Xperia-line relatives – a veritable Jan Brady to the Arc’s Marcia.

But Sony Ericsson had to make some trade-offs in size in order for the slide-out frame to hide the PlayStation controller underneath. If you’re a gamer, it’s worth it. We felt right at home with the familiar PlayStation controller configuration — D-pad on the left, with the square, circle, triangle and X buttons on the right.

And unlike other, flimsier slider phones, the plastic hardware isn’t chintzy. The Play still feels sturdy in hand, even in its open position, and most likely won’t break under the pressure of an excited gamer’s grip.

Instead of the centered joysticks found on a PS3 controller, two pressure-sensitive touchpads take their place. So rather than hog up precious screen real estate steering with your fingers on games that require touch-sensitive direction, you can use the two physical touchpads. It’s a nifty concept, and fairly well-executed. The games I played that utilize the pads were decent enough in reaction time, though I found the sensitivity a bit wanting.

The phone comes bundled with seven games, though only one was exclusive to the Play: _[Crash Bandicoot_.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2iMDugM5z0) It’s a PS One classic, and I was psyched to see it on the roster. But if I’m buying the long-awaited PlayStation phone, I want it to be running PlayStation games. Plural.

When I asked if Sony Ericsson would continue publishing PlayStation classics to the Xperia Play, the answer was cagey, though promising: "It's the first step we're taking down this path." I've got my fingers crossed for a _Twisted Metal_ port by the end of the year.

I actually enjoyed the experience of gaming on the Play. For the first time, I didn't feel like I was playing a game slapped onto a phone interface. It feels like a standalone portable gaming device. That's no easy feat to accomplish.

Polygons rendered beautifully on the Play's 4-inch capacitive touch screen, which was plenty big enough to view the games we played. I did wonder if I'd be wanting more screen surface area while playing a first-person shooter like _Call of Duty_ (or if we really wanted to get old school, _Doom_) – but since those games aren't available for the Xperia Play, it's a moot point for now.

You might think the Play is underpowered, given that its processor is a single-core, 1-GHz Qualcomm Snapdragon chip, not the dual-core [Nvidia Tegra 2 processor](https://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/tag/tegra-2/?intcid=inline_amp) found in many recent smartphone and tablet offerings. But that's not the case: the Play ran games and rendered menu screens like a charm. We didn't experience any noticeable lag while gaming, nor while running Google's proprietary smartphone apps like Gmail or Calendar.

Oh, and did we mention that the Xperia Play is also an Android phone? Because it is, and not a shabby one at that. Over the five days we spent with the phone, Verizon’s network coverage was ample. From Seattle to San Francisco, we didn’t experience any dropped calls or have much of a problem finding a signal. One big bummer, however: The phone uses Verizon's 3G network, not the newer, faster 4G network.

Like many other smartphones, it’s got two cameras – VGA on the front as well as a 5-megapixel back-facing brother – but they’re not the greatest. The few shots I took looked washed out, a bit grainier than I would have liked. But as far as camera phones go, they’ll get the job done.

But let’s be honest. Cameras aren’t the reason you’re buying this phone. It’s a gamer’s toy, and bells and whistles like front-facing cameras should be judged with that in mind.

Our verdict after a week with the Play?

Game on.

**Wired:** Unskinned version of Android 2.3 (Gingerbread) makes us happy. Sturdy hardware stands up to a frustrated gamer’s kung-fu grip.

**Tired:** Lacks 720p video recording capability, now a standard in smartphone releases. Wireless data is slower 3G standard, not 4G. Only one PlayStation title available at launch.

# Sony Ericsson Xperia Play (CDMA) review
Ross Miller Jun 15, 2011 at 09:31
![Xperia-play-review-dsc_0666-rm-verge-555](http://assets.sbnation.com/assets/768621/xperia-play-review-DSC_0666-rm-verge-555.jpg)

The design itself is very much in line with the Xperia X10 aesthetic — a curved top and bottom, gloss screen, shiny silver buttons — super glossy and dust-loving, too, which makes it hard to keep clean. It’s got Qualcomm’s 1GHz MSM 8655 "Scorpion" Snapdragon, an Adreno 205 GPU, and 512MB RAM. At 6.2 ounces, it’s certainly on the heavier side, but nothing egregious. The 5.1 megapixel rear camera is actually a step back from the X10′s lens; it’s good, but the colors never quite come out as vividly as I’d like. Although I haven’t done extensive testing on the battery, the phone seems to last just under a full day under normal use.

The max brightness of the screen is criminally low

Then there’s the 4-inch, 854 x 480 display. I’m not sure what the deal is, but the max brightness of the screen is criminally low. Even in a moderately lit room, the glare made some parts of Crash Bandicoot incredibly challenging.

What makes the Xperia Play stand out, of course, is its slide-out gamepad. The d-pad, face buttons (PlayStation’s traditional square / triangle / circle / X) and L / R triggers are snappy and responsive; the trackpads, however, are rough and imprecise. That slide-out gives the phone a total depth of 16mm, easily the thickest phone on my desk right now.

Sony Ericsson was surprisingly (and thankfully) conservative with its customization with the Verizon model — even more so than it was with the European counterpart. Android 2.3.2 has been largely left alone here, aside from a few additional (and optional) widgets. There is some stuttering when switching between panes, but it’s otherwise a pretty smooth experience.

Then there’s the Xperia Play play app, which is really two portals in one: your library of games and a section to shop for more. Both look identical, and at first glance you might get the two confused. Game icons are lined up in a navigable row. Many of the titles are just Android games with some added gamepad functionality — none of which really add much to the experience. It’s also a shame that there’s no way to tell which games are built with Xperia Play and which are these pre-existing "augmented" Android titles. It’s a missed opportunity that should be highlighting the cream of the crop, the titles that really justify the "classic" controls. Performance-wise, all the games I played ran about as smooth as I’ve been seeing elsewhere (e.g. Asphalt 5), but compared with dual-core phones the load times were decidedly slower.

The three games that do stand out to me are Star Battalion (a Starfox knockoff), the Tekken-esque fighter _Bruce Lee Dragon Warrior_, and _Crash Bandicoot_. The latter is a bit-for-bit port of the PS One original, and includes options to adjust controls for use of the trackpads and / or adding on-screen keys to compensate for the lack of L2 / R2. The game hasn’t quite stood the test of time, and given the 4:3 aspect ratio, I don’t see any reason why it couldn’t be played just fine with some on-screen button overlay in the black bars. Fun? Sure, but there’s certainly nothing of the quality you’d get with a DS, PSP, or iPhone / iPod touch — and most of what’s good is available for other Android devices.

# Sony Ericsson Xperia Play Review - IGN
 
The Sony Ericsson Xperia Play suffers from what I like to call 3DS Disorder, symptoms of which include, but are not limited to: underwhelming hardware with a critical lack of killer apps. But, like Nintendo's newest handheld, the Xperia Play is based on a sound idea, and with a little time and software support, could become a solid mobile gaming solution.Initially, I was adverse to the idea of the Xperia Play after all, who would really want to invest in a gaming-centric smartphone? But after using it for a while, I began to see the utility of the slide-out gaming interface. Though I'm not much of a smartphone gamer for a variety of reasons, the awkward nature of touch or tilt control methods top the list, and the Xperia Play eliminates the need for both. Assuming, of course, the game in question supports it.  
  
At launch, the Xperia Play comes pre-installed with six titles five Android games, including Asphalt 6, Bruce Lee, Madden '11, Star Batallion, and the Sims 3, and one PlayStation Classic, Crash Bandicoot. Additionally, there are another 50 or so Android titles available that support the Xperia Play's slider controls, such as Gun Bros, Farm Story, and Brothers In Arms 2: Global Front HD.  
  
It's not that there isn't fun to be had with the available games, it's just that none live up to the potential and assumed future of the platform, which of course is the ability to play PlayStation-caliber and new original games. Crash Bandicoot is a great first step, but other PSX Classics are not available currently, despite the fact that UK versions of the device come pre-installed with Syphon Filter.Nevertheless, from a technical standpoint, the Xperia Play has potential.  
  


![](https://gearmedia.ign.com/gear/image/article/115/1159358/sony-xperia-play-20110404030817384-000.jpg)

  
  
The PSPgo-esque control interface looks, feels, and performs exceptionally; the d-pad and action buttons have a distinctive click to them and input response time is fantastic. The shoulder buttons are thin to keep the size of the device down, but they are still accessible.  
  
Unlike a PSPgo, the Xperia Play calls upon a centralized touch panel for analog controls rather than physical thumbsticks. The surface spans from the d-pad to the action buttons, but has etched circles and centered points to provide tactile differentiation between the left and right analogs.  
  
Surprisingly, the touch panel actually does a great job of detecting subtle thumb movements and translates to gameplay effectively.  
  
Not all games use the controls as effectively as others, however, and input delays are more apparent in adapted titles like Asphalt 6 than they are in ones with native gamepad support like Crash Bandicoot.  
  
Moreover, a lot of games fail to take advantage of the secondary controls, like the start and select buttons and the menu button. Instead, users have to touch the on-screen pause button or use the smartphone controls on the right side (or bottom when used in portrait mode) of the screen.  
  


![](https://gearmedia.ign.com/gear/image/article/115/1159358/sony-xperia-play-20110404030823540-000.jpg)

  
  
Since most of the lineup is already available on other devices, they run almost identically on the Xperia Play in terms of framerate performance and graphics quality.  
  
As for the device itself, the Xperia Play is a decent smartphone, but hardly on the cutting edge of mobile technology. The system packs a single core 1GHz Snapdragon processor with an Adreno 205 graphics core, which give it plenty of power, but considering that many new mobile products have graduated to dual-core processing and NVIDIA Tegra-based graphics, the Xperia Play won't be able to tackle more demanding titles later down the line, such as [Shadowgun](https://media.wireless.ign.com/media/109/109771/imgs_1.html).  
  
The build is sturdy and well constructed, though based largely on high-gloss plastic making it a smudge and dust magnet. As a slider, it's naturally a bit thicker than the average smartphone, but it's hardly tough to carry around.  
  
The display is a touch-enabled TFT display with a resolution of 854 by 480 pixels, which falls short of some of its higher resolution, AMOLED-packing competition. The sound quality of the speakers is expectedly limited, and the preferred experience is obviously when using headphones.  
  
One saving grace of the Xperia Play is that it ships with Android 2.3 Gingerbread installed rather than many other handsets, which still offer only version 2.2 Froyo. Running Gingerbread allows the Xperia Play to access the latest and greatest apps and games offered on the Marketplace, including [Google's new Music Beta](https://gear.ign.com/articles/116/1167596p1.html) service, which allows users to upload and stream up to 20,000 songs to their smartphone.  
  


![](https://gearmedia.ign.com/gear/image/article/115/1159358/sony-xperia-play-20110404030821384-000.jpg)

  
  
Despite having full access to the Marketplace, the only way to get Xperia Play-capable games, however, is through a Verizon-specific app called V-Cast Apps. Requiring users to use two separate digital distribution methods and payment structures is unnecessary and time consuming. Ideally, Google would simply have an Xperia Play or PlayStation Certified section on the Marketplace, but instead users are forced to use a less intuitive, harder to browse distribution app.  
  
Battery life is average, achieving roughly 11 to 12 hours for regular use without requiring a recharge.  
  
Features wise, the Xperia Play is pretty basic the rear-facing camera is 5.1 megapixels with LED flash, while the front-facing VGA camera is grainy but functional. It, of course, comes standard with Bluetooth support, but there aren't any added frills.  
  
When you get right down to it, its not that the Xperia Play is a terrible phone, its just not a particularly great one. Sony Ericsson has undershot market trends by making it a modestly powered and featured device, and released it at a time when there simply isn't enough support for the PlayStation Certified platform to make it a compelling purchase for gamers or casual consumers.  
  
Though Sony Computer Entertainment is certain to expand their software offering in the future and Minecraft will arrive first on the Xperia Play, there isn't enough to merit a purchase now.

# Sony Ericsson Xperia Play review | Engadget
 
![Sony Ericsson Xperia Play review](https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/DSM8Rbur7pDM81ebNr1dqA--~B/Zmk9ZmlsbDtoPTQ1MDt3PTY3NTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/HN0nVjYNoe_ui7hFAcEJTg--~B/aD00MDA7dz02MDA7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://www.blogcdn.com/www.engadget.com/media/2011/03/11x0328mar0424.jpg.cf.jpg) The _PlayStation_ Phone. We've had quite the intimate history with this gamepad-equipped slider, learning of its secretive existence way back in [August](https://www.engadget.com/2010-08-11-exclusive-sony-ericsson-to-introduce-android-3-0-gaming-platfor.html) and then handling a prototype unit in [January](https://www.engadget.com/2011-01-26-sony-ericsson-xperia-play-playstation-phone-preview.html), so you'll forgive us for feeling sentimental and still entertaining our pet name for it. The Sony Ericsson marketing gurus renamed it the [Xperia Play](https://www.engadget.com/2011-02-13-the-sony-ericsson-xperia-play.html) when it finally went official at MWC this year, but the PlayStation connection remains as strong as ever. Aside from the D-pad, iconic game keys, and two touchpads, this device comes with a little app named PlayStation Pocket, which will be serving up dollops of classic PlayStation One gaming to all those with a taste for it. Yes, the Sony influence is strong with this one, and the Android Market will be joining the fun with Xperia Play-optimized titles from third-party developers. So all we really need to know now is whether the Android smartphone underpinning this smash-bang fusion of old and new school entertainment happens to be any good. Shall we get Started?  
%Gallery-119806%  


###  Hardware

  


#####  The gamepad

  
There's likely little point in us trying to discuss any of the Xperia Play's external hardware before addressing its literal and figurative centerpiece, the slide-out gamepad. A DualShock attached to your smartphone it is not, but you already knew that. The real question is how close it comes to replicating the console experience rather than how well it competes with it. Judged on such terms, the Play acquits itself very well. The digital directional keys are firm with a satisfying amount of travel and the same goes for the face buttons. Squeezed in between them, Sony Ericsson also throws in a pair of analog pads, which react to your input in much the same fashion as the capacitive touchscreen does -- with the big difference being that while you use the pads you're not obscuring any of the action on screen. Each pad has a handy indented dot at its center, helping to orient your thumb without the need to look down. 

![](https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dar/5845cadfecd996e0372f/35677e52f3de6f0f11dc0888efcbc38a9f3ada21/aHR0cDovL3d3dy5ibG9nY2RuLmNvbS93d3cuZW5nYWRnZXQuY29tL21lZGlhLzIwMTEvMDMvMTF4MDMyODA0MDkuanBn)

An Android Menu button on the bottom left is accompanied by Select and Start keys on the right (at least one of these three buttons feels perfunctory as they serve overlapping functions) and there are two shoulder buttons on the outside, where you would usually find the L1 and R1 controls on the proper console gamepad. Some among our staff have taken to calling them _flippers_, because they're closer to flaps or paddles in their operation than fully fledged buttons. In actual gameplay, we found them a little too sensitive, which caused us to activate them unintentionally a few times and fail almost completely when prompted by one game to press them simultaneously. We succeeded once out of every six or seven tries, such was the capriciousness of their design. 

![](https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dar/5845cadfecd996e0372f/a836ce0ada0e5e9f5fc4ed41e18801719f885535/aHR0cDovL3d3dy5ibG9nY2RuLmNvbS93d3cuZW5nYWRnZXQuY29tL21lZGlhLzIwMTEvMDMvMTEwMzI4MTIxdnguanBn)

The sliding mechanism responsible for serving up the gaming controls is pretty much flawless. It's spring-loaded, meaning you only need to slide it halfway up or down to achieve the required opening or closing action and it does the rest by itself. Movement is smooth and consistent, and one-handed operation is no problem either. What impressed us most about it, though, was its sturdiness. There's no tilt to the handset, the screen just slides straight up, and that's the way it stays -- perfectly parallel, no matter the violence of our attempts to find any structural flaws. It's clear to see that Sony Ericsson spent a lot of time refining this slider and we're happy to say it lives up to a very high standard of durability -- an absolute necessity when making a button masher's device such as this. 

![](https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dar/5845cadfecd996e0372f/8b870844f30c4b053a0a38a4e69fe424b670f28f/aHR0cDovL3d3dy5ibG9nY2RuLmNvbS93d3cuZW5nYWRnZXQuY29tL21lZGlhLzIwMTEvMDMvMTF4MDMyODk5bjhkYS5qcGc=)

Moving to the top half of the slider, we find a volume rocker, nestled craftily in between the aforementioned shoulder buttons, a power key, and the usual four Android buttons, arranged in yet another _innovative_ formation. For whatever reason, Sony Ericsson opted to swap the Home and Menu buttons' positions up front, leaving our prototype unit looking desperately out of date and us wondering why it had to be done at all. While we've no complaints to proffer about the power and volume keys, we must express our deep discontentment with the Android set. They're quite spongy, meaning they can absorb a lot of pressure before registering a click, which tends to lead to an inconsistent and frustrating user experience. Even more troublesome is the difficulty to differentiate between them by touch alone, forcing you to look down, which is then amplified by the fact they're not backlit. So yeah, the Xperia Play will give you a whole new reason to be afraid of the dark.  
  


#####  Construction

![](https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dar/5845cadfecd996e0372f/766dfd428c21ac791e7a7b08bea51e458971f51f/aHR0cDovL3d3dy5ibG9nY2RuLmNvbS93d3cuZW5nYWRnZXQuY29tL21lZGlhLzIwMTEvMDMvMTF4MDMyOHJvNTU0LmpwZw==)

Squeaks and creaks were sadly too readily apparent with the Play, mostly owing to the poor quality of plastics used in its construction. It's a rigid device and, as already pointed out, there's little questioning its internal structure, but there's no getting around the fact that SE didn't blow the budget on procuring the most high-end of shell materials. The rear cover feels brittle, in spite of its flexibility, and the overall glossy aesthetic lends itself to picking up scuffs and scratches easily. The metallic accents aren't to our tastes, either, mostly because they're not made out of actual metal. And if you're not going to at least insert a little bit of premium material or functional utility in your design, why complicate it? Build quality is, therefore, a mixed bag. We get the feeling that after a while the Xperia Play will end up looking rather like _The Terminator_ \-- losing its soft and and pathetic outer shell, but revealing some hardcore engineering within. Maybe that'll be a good look for it. 

  
A final note is merited about the Play's dimensions. At 16mm (0.63 inches) in thickness and 175g (6.2 ounces) in weight, this may easily be the chubbiest flagship Android device you're going to see coming out this year. That said, provided you're not too bothered by its heft (and you shouldn't be), it's actually shaped to sit very neatly in the hand. Its curved rear is reminiscent of the Palm Pre, though to the Play's credit it also manages to lie perfectly flat when rested on horizontal surfaces. When opened up into action mode, the whole device again feels nicely thought out and we doubt there'll be a hand size that won't be suited by its shape.  
  


#####  Internals

Allow your curiosity to drag you past the Play's rear cover and you'll be rewarded with a happy surprise -- both the SIM and MicroSD card slots are accessible without removing the battery. Not many phones make it that convenient and another rarely seen asset the Play can tout is a set of stereo speakers. They're not just two mono outputs, there's actually a tiny little sound stage created by them working in tandem. The quality of the audio they pump out isn't going to threaten a set of dedicated speakers, but it's certainly a lot more tolerable than the general mediocrity we're used to from smartphones. Considering the device's entertainment-centric reason for existence, we believe this to be a big strong point in its favor.  
  
In terms of the hardware that makes the wheels go round, the Xperia Play relies on a 1GHz Qualcomm MSM8255 Snapdragon chip, which comes with an Adreno 205 GPU. Neither is a slouch, but it's obvious that more could, and perhaps should, have been included in this bargain. Looking around at the spring / summertime smartphone landscape, a potential Play buyer will be confronted by Motorola's Atrix and Droid Bionic, LG's Optimus 2X and Optimus 3D, Samsung's Galaxy S II, and HTC's EVO 3D -- all of whom tout dual-core SOCs and generous apportionments of RAM. Oh yes, about the RAM. There's <strike>only 400MB</strike> 512MB of it on the Xperia Play (**Update:** We double-checked with Sony Ericsson and found that the Play comes with 512MB of RAM, 400MB of which is available for applications to use) . It may seem overly demanding to expect every new smartphone to match up to those benchmark destroyers, but we must remember the Xperia Play is about gaming and games will make use of every last ounce of performance you can give them. As it stands, it's a healthy and sprightly device today, but do be aware of the gathering storm clouds above its future. It's simply not powerful enough for us to give you any assurances about its long-term viability.

We found battery life a little lacking. There's a robust 1500mAh cell inside this handset, but we could only stretch it to about 22 hours under our light use test. It was a day's worth of sporadic use, where checking up on things like Gmail, Twitter and Facebook updates was the phone's most regular exercise. For a comparison, the similarly outfitted -- MSM8255 with Adreno 205 -- [Incredible S](https://www.engadget.com/2011-03-21-htc-incredible-s-review.html) from HTC managed to squeak past the 50-hour mark in spite of having a battery with 50mAh less juice. Again, both were subjected to light workloads that are unlikely to be representative of everyone's daily routine, but the delta in endurance between the two phones was striking. Not to put too fine a point on it, but something tells us all those software bells and whistles on the Play (hello, Timescape!) are working against Sony Ericsson here. On the bright side, throwing some actual gaming action its way didn't obliterate the battery quite as badly as we feared it might. Our overall impression (from admittedly limited testing) is that this will clearly not be an endurance smartphone because of its software overhead, but Sony Ericsson's promises of five and a half hours of continuous gameplay seem well within reach.

Another thing that's taxing the Play's battery unduly is its screen. The default brightness setting for it is at the very maximum and once you use it for a while, you realize why. It's _very_ dim. We're not talking about it being mediocre or some way short of the best, it's so lacking in brightness that it's borderline dysfunctional. Taking the phone out for an afternoon outside, we couldn't play _Crash Bandicoot_ even on the bus, never mind out in the direct glare of the sun. It's not an unqualified disaster, as viewing angles are pretty wide, the 854 x 480 resolution is decent, and under the right circumstances you can obtain some pleasantly vibrant images from it, but it's still one the worst screens we've seen on a review phone -- hell, review hardware of any kind. This was most apparent to us outdoors when we used it side by side with Sony Ericsson's own Xperia Arc, the latter handset giving us better contrast, saturation, and of course, brightness. Both phones lack an auto-brightness option in their settings, which is a weird omission on Sony Ericsson's part, even if in the case of the Play it'd just be kept at max anyway.  
  


#####  Camera

  
Speaking of omissions, has anyone at SE HQ heard about the little trend of making 720p video recording a _de facto_ standard feature in high-end Android smartphones? Because, well, the Xperia Play doesn't have it. We know full well that the hardware's capable of it -- a 5 megapixel imager sits round the back, so more than enough pixels can be pulled together to saturate a 1280 x 720 frame, and the 1GHz Snapdragon under the hood pretty much snorts with indignation at the routine task of processing such workloads at 30fps. What gives, we don't know, but the video you _do_ get, recorded at a maximum of 800 x 480, isn't all that great anyhow. The recordings produced during our testing tended to be very soft, with noise suppression algorithms seemingly working overtime to ensure the smudgy appearance. That issue was compounded by poor microphone performance, which muffled and straight up distorted some of the sounds it picked up during recording.

Things look much brighter on the still imaging front, however, where we churned out some highly satisfactory results without requiring an excess of effort. Options on Sony Ericsson's custom software are a little limited, but you can adjust exposure, white balance, and focusing mode, which should still be sufficient for most users. Especially praiseworthy among those controls is the Macro mode on the Play, which allowed us to get seriously [up close and personal](http://www.engadget.com/photos/xperia-play-camera-samples/#4005399) with some of our subjects. On the downside, the Play's camera struggles to focus in low light and noise is no less an issue here than on most other smartphone sensors. One fanciful idea we had, in the absence of a dedicated physical shutter button, was that Sony Ericsson could have used the right shoulder key to double up as one. It's in just about the perfect location for the task and we can't see anything preventing SE (or some enterprising hackers, perchance?) from hooking it up to the picture-taking software. Overall, it's a decent to good camera with some disappointing video recording tacked on.  
  


###  Software

  


#####  PlayStation Pocket

![](https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dar/5845cadfecd996e0372f/3fa0d198a7c02e8f61857041eb9cf80fa4275e1f/aHR0cDovL3d3dy5ibG9nY2RuLmNvbS93d3cuZW5nYWRnZXQuY29tL21lZGlhLzIwMTEvMDMvMTF4MDMyOG1uZjkuanBn)

As with the hardware section, we'll get straight to the PlayStation meat of the Xperia Play software matter. Two apps will be of foremost interest here: the not at all confusingly named Xperia Play, which serves as a showcase for Android Market games compatible with the Play's controls, and the PlayStation Pocket, which houses the hallowed PS One games that this new smartphone is so primed to enjoy. For the moment at least, we should probably narrow that down to the singular _game_, since the Play ships with just the one preloaded classic title, _Crash Bandicoot_, and the rest of the PS One library is still en route. That puts the Play's launch, coming up on April 1st across Europe, into a rather precarious position. It's supposed to be the bringer of great new entertainments to the [thumb-equipped](https://www.engadget.com/2011-03-14-sony-ericssons-xperia-play-ad-gross-human-thumbs-stitched-onto.html) masses and yet we're staring at just one original piece of content upon its release. _Bruce Lee_, _FIFA 10_, _Star Battalion HD_, and _The Sims 3_ do come preloaded to soften the blow, but they're not exclusive to the Play, and in the particular case of _The Sims_, don't even benefit very much from the physical controls. Still, they're there and the means to accessing them is actually pretty swish. Opening up the slider kicks you straight into the Xperia Play app, where the games you already have on the device are split out from the list of purchasable compatible titles, meaning you're never more than a slide and a tap away from leaping into action. 

![](https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dar/5845cadfecd996e0372f/edb2c16b68b0349ebc7685424fc9ac43929f8e0f/aHR0cDovL3d3dy5ibG9nY2RuLmNvbS93d3cuZW5nYWRnZXQuY29tL21lZGlhLzIwMTEvMDMvMTEwMzI4MTIydnguanBn)

Loading times for the games aboard the Play were quite tolerable indeed -- nothing was instant, but only the most impatient of gamer would find them a nuisance. In-game performance also gave us no cause for complaint, with smooth frame rates throughout. The basics look to have been well taken care of. One drawback we should highlight, however, is the fact that most, if not all, PS One games were coded for displays with a 4:3 ratio. That means either zooming or stretching the game in order to fill the widescreen panel on the Xperia Play. Both options are available to you in the settings, but _Crash_ was already looking pretty aliased without us zooming in for a closer inspection. Not an ideal situation, but that's where we find ourselves. At least until Sony decides it's a good idea to drop its vast catalog of PSP games atop this device, then we'll have no such worries.  
  
The gamepad is not abandoned completely once you stray outside the gaming arena, as you're able to navigate through lists with the D-pad and select and cancel things with the X and O keys. It's a somewhat inconsistent affair, as this integration doesn't permeate everything on the Play, but we found it useful in the browser and messaging apps.  
  


#####  Android à la Sony Ericsson

![](https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dar/5845cadfecd996e0372f/af95fcadcfe5482fbdfeae499a33441e29899936/aHR0cDovL3d3dy5ibG9nY2RuLmNvbS93d3cuZW5nYWRnZXQuY29tL21lZGlhLzIwMTEvMDMvMTF4MDMyODY2N20uanBn)

The OS underlying SE's new hero device is of course Android. Version 2.3.2 (aka Gingerbread) is shipping out on retail devices, marking this as one of the first non-Google handsets to come preloaded with Mountain View's latest and greatest. That means much-improved text manipulation thanks to the addition of new [selection anchors](http://www.engadget.com/photos/nexus-s-review/#3668424), a general sprucing up of visuals, and a set of extra APIs with a gaming bent. Wonder why Sony Ericsson wanted to run its gaming device atop this platform, eh? Nonetheless, the company's UI designers haven't been sitting around exercising their thumbs and there's a vast amount of aesthetic tweaking done on top of Android. Almost all of it is for the better, in our opinion, as the whole UI benefits from a look of sophistication and maturity that Android has generally lacked. The phone interface is spacious and welcoming, while the contacts and messaging interfaces are extremely attractive, sensibly laid out, and utterly delicious to scroll through. Talk about optimization! The contacts section can also be navigated more rapidly just by initials and, if you have Twitter accounts associated with your buds' numbers, it shows you a snippet of their latest update, very handy. Moreover, entering individual contacts' pages shows their profile pictures nicely blended with the background, reinforcing the overarching theme of refined design. Thankfully, Sony Ericsson's alterations all look to be skin-deep, giving us some cause to believe the company's pledge that it'll be quick in responding to new Android rollouts from the Google mothership. Time will only tell. 

![](https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dar/5845cadfecd996e0372f/3d38e95fe85b007476fb115528a6140858a2ab6b/aHR0cDovL3d3dy5ibG9nY2RuLmNvbS93d3cuZW5nYWRnZXQuY29tL21lZGlhLzIwMTEvMDMvMTF4MDMyOG1uZjcuanBn)

There are some downsides to the skinning efforts on the Play, however, as might be expected. One is the aforementioned issue of the battery seemingly running down quicker than it ought to, which you can always offset by making your own adjustments, but obviously that's no great consolation for those hoping the device would just work like it should straight out of the box. Another thing we noticed was that Timescape, albeit a mere removable widget now instead of the overwhelming leviathan it was on the Xperia X10, was still susceptible to slow performance and even the occasional freeze-up. It remains an extremely graphically demanding tool, what with all its overlays and three-dimensional animations, so that's no surprise, but we still enjoy our user experience more without it than with it. It wasn't entirely alone in showing slowdowns, we experienced a few, very minor, hangups and delays while using the Play, but couldn't find any repeatable bugs to report. It feels a mostly solid build, though it's a little disappointing that the aforementioned smoothness of operation in the customized messaging and contacts apps doesn't carry over to the rest of the UX.  
  
Browser performance is mostly decent, but we've definitely seen faster, whether you're talking other Android devices, Windows Phone 7 or iOS. Pinch-to-zoom and scrolling commands are executed, but in a slightly labored fashion. Aliasing is also apparent when zooming out from pages, not unlike what we saw on the Incredible S recently. Finally, SE's onscreen portrait keyboard is a little too cramped for our liking, with the letters being tall but not altogether wide enough to make for comfortable typing. Sony Ericsson might have done well to just stick with the default Gingerbread provision here.  
  


###  Wrap-up

![](https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dar/5845cadfecd996e0372f/0f744480d928c69dfc4a806f83c21aa4481d1782/aHR0cDovL3d3dy5ibG9nY2RuLmNvbS93d3cuZW5nYWRnZXQuY29tL21lZGlhLzIwMTEvMDMvMTF4MDMyOG1uZjExLmpwZw==)

We've reached out to Sony Ericsson asking for a roadmap of when we can expect the PlayStation Suite and more PlayStation One titles to roll up on the Xperia Play bandwagon and make it worth joining. As it stands today, on the day of review and the precipice of its launch, the Play is looking out on a pretty barren gaming landscape. The Android titles up for grabs are not exclusive to the device and don't necessarily benefit all that greatly from its unique control scheme, whereas the catalog of classic PlayStation content stops after just one entry.  
  
So with almost no differentiating software of its own, the Play is really relying on the strength of its gamepad to round up willing participants in its gaming revolution. We concur that that's indeed the phone's main strength, with good ergonomics and an extremely durable sliding mechanism. Nonetheless, the poor quality of the screen and good, but not great, hardware spec force us to be reluctant about recommending it as a sage purchase at present. Perhaps it picks up a loyal following, from both developers and fans alike, and within a few short weeks, we're all looking at a device with a rich ecosystem of compelling tailor-made content and a ton of reasons to own it. But as for today? We'd rather spend our cash elsewhere in the Android cosmos and hold out hope for the PlayStation Phone 2.0.
