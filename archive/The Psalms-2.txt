      The Psalms (alternatively/interchangeably entitled Bilge) is a
      monobyline World Wide Web Blog written by

      Less abstractly, its beat is <emphasis role="strong">wholly

      For better or worse, my voice as represented in <emphasis>The
      Psalms</emphasis> has continued to be saturated with
      self-referential and occasionally self-disparaging/deprecating
      qualification. If I am indeed an authority on myself, I would
      suggest that these are essential tools rather than crutches, and
      note that I have made some progress in excusing myself for them
      out of the (perhaps clich√©) realization that ‚Äúlife‚Äù ‚Äì and
      especially <emphasis>truth</emphasis> ‚Äì can be infinitely
      complicated, and therefore worthwhile thought on just about
      anything is inevitably going to be (sometimes aggravatingly)
      tedious in its complexity.

        Since I first began working online in 2016, I have grown and
        maintained quite a curatorial habit, and therefore sought all
        sorts of modern curator's tools. The system I settled upon for
        some five years: a dedicated
        <link xlink:href="http://bit.ly/extratone">Reading List
        channel</link> in <emphasis>Extratone</emphasis>'s Discord. It
        wasn't until this past year that I encouraged something which
        (so far) has exceeded willy-nilly copy-and-paste of URLs into a
        single feed. It's an application/bookmarking service called
        <link xlink:href="https://bit.ly/dbraindrop"><emphasis role="strong">Raindrop</emphasis></link>
        which includes tagging, public, RSS-enabled collections, and
        fairy competent web page archiving. I became a paid subscriber
        within minutes of discovering its existence, three months ago,
        and have since integrated it quite hardily in my workflow
        (including automated reposts in that same Discord channel, for
        good measure.) For now, the arrangement is sortof experimental,
        but obviously, I'm rooting for
        <link xlink:href="https://raindrop.io/about">Rustem
        Mussabekov</link> ‚Äì sole creator and sentinel of Raindrop.

        of an electronic music magazine called

        I also curate the music podcast

        Collection</link> and a playlist on Apple Music called

        of the most astonishing and unique electronic tracks I come

        I've intermittently recorded
        <link xlink:href="https://davidblue.bandcamp.com/">piano
        improvs</link> under my own name (though I haven't properly in a
        good while.) On
        <link xlink:href="https://davidblue.bandcamp.com/album/four"><emphasis>Four</emphasis></link>,
        my most recent improv tape, I used two knockoff SM57s placed
        directly above my sleepy childhood upright piano at my mom's
        house through a USB mixer and
        <link xlink:href="https://youtu.be/p3KoQ6n0xKo">livestreamed
        most of the recording</link>. The result is a fairly good
        representation of what I was doing musically at the time and
        probably the most dynamically interesting of all the recordings
        I've captured. The instrument itself has a very particular
        dreamy quality that I've never heard on any other.

        Considering my use of Git as a means to track revisions on my

        While I appreciate tremendously the work and contribution of
        <link xlink:href="https://ar.to/2010/01/set-your-code-free">Arlo
        Bendiken</link> in the form of The Unlicense, I would like to
        add that I see no need, personally, to make the refutation of
        Intellectual Property law regarding my own work into some
        profound ethical statement. As it stands, I have not to my
        knowledge been the victim of any sort of theft of any kind, and
        find the suggestion highly unlikely. If I
        <emphasis>am</emphasis> made aware of such a case, there is
        certainly a possibility that I may change my mind on this issue,
        so I suppose I should highlight that
        <emphasis role="strong">THESE TERMS ARE SUBJECT TO

        and/or amused than actually offended.

        I would also like to annotate that my use of this license should
        not be regarded as a suggestion that anyone else follow my

        one's work, generally. While I did indeed take the time to set

    <title>America's favorite drivetrain is not ideal.</title>
    <para>
      Us drivers of cars with manual transmissions tend to look down on
      those who drive automatics. It‚Äôs like an exclusive club. Only the
      extremely talented, gorgeous-looking, and legendary athletes of
      yore are allowed in.
    </para>
    <para>
      Well, that‚Äôs bullshit. So those of you that know the ‚Äústandard‚Äù
      can keep your mouths shut and bask in the quiet satisfaction that
      you‚Äôre saving the planet.
    </para>
    <para>
      The truth is, for those of you that don‚Äôt know, driving ‚Äústick‚Äù is
      totally simple. Once you understand the basic concepts of how the
      transmission and clutch work together, you can figure it out with
      no real instruction at all. So with that in mind, I‚Äôd like to tell
      you that automatic transmissions just‚Ä¶.suck. Really.
    </para>
    <para>
      Mind you, I‚Äôm not talking about Dual-Clutch Transmissions, SMGs
      (Sequential Manual Gearboxes,) or any of that fancy stuff that has
      only recently become somewhat popular in the mainstream
      (affordable) auto market. I‚Äôm talking about automatics with a
      torque converter, that magically inefficient device that has
      carried America‚Äôs laziness in driving for the last 50 years.
    </para>
    <para>
      Now before I go on, I suppose I owe you a technical explanation.
      Let‚Äôs start with the basics. First off, a transmission is the
      device that separates the engine from the wheels. With both
      automatic and manual transmissions, ‚Äúgears‚Äù are used to vary the
      ratio between the engine‚Äôs crankshaft and the drive shaft going to
      the wheels. It‚Äôs essentially a buffer between the engine‚Äôs
      relative consistency and the inconsistent world that you drive in.
    </para>
    <para>
      <inlinemediaobject>
        <imageobject>
          <imagedata fileref="xhtml/https:/i.snap.as/U2c418j.png" />
        </imageobject>
      </inlinemediaobject>
    </para>
    <para>
      But that‚Äôs not quite all there is.
    </para>
    <para>
      Traditional transmissions require an interruption in power from
      the engine to shift these ‚Äúgears,‚Äù and to come to a stop at a
      traffic light, in your driveway, or on the side of the highway to
      pick up a hooker. In manuals, this is typically accomplished with
      a clutch, a device that could most simply be explained as two
      plates that are pressed together to couple, and brought apart to
      become independent. A clutch is normally coupled, it‚Äôs when the
      clutch petal is pushed in that the plates separate, and the
      transmission is isolated from the engine. Automatic transmissions
      use a type of fluid coupling to accomplish the same task, called a
      torque converter.
    </para>
    <para>
      The advantage of the latter is that, when paired with an automatic
      transmission, the driver only requires one input to get the car
      moving and vary its velocity, and that is the accelerator pedal. A
      manual transmission requires three inputs, on the other hand.
      (Accelerator pedal, clutch, and gearshift.) In my mind, the torque
      converter has some huge disadvantages in a world where millions
      are spent to save 20 lbs. on one car design.
    </para>
    <para>
      Have you ever noticed that cars equipped with manuals are usually
      noticeably more fuel efficient than their automatic counterparts?
      Some of that could be attributed to the greater control that comes
      with manuals, but most of it is from the torque converter‚Äôs main
      design flaw. A clutch can be completely disengaged and completely
      engaged. So, with a healthy vehicle, there is 0% of the engine‚Äôs
      power moving to the transmission when the clutch pedal is
      depressed fully. Likewise when the clutch pedal is allowed
      completely out, the clutch essentially becomes a shaft, and 100%
      of the engine‚Äôs power is being fed to the transmission.
    </para>
    <para>
      A torque converter couples via fluid, however, meaning
      <emphasis role="strong">there is never a solid mechanical
      connection between the engine and the transmission</emphasis>.
      (Unless the transmission is equipped with a lock-up clutch, which
      is essentially a clutch that locks the torque converter
      mechanically when it is no longer required to dump the engine‚Äôs
      energy into friction. These are becoming more and more common, but
      the majority of vehicles on the road are missing them.) This means
      that a traditional torque converter is
      <emphasis role="strong">never 100% efficient</emphasis>.
    </para>
    <para>
      Also, a torque converter is never completely disengaged. When
      sitting at a traffic light, the driver typically lightly applies
      the brakes to hold the car from moving forward. Have you ever
      considered what you‚Äôre doing? The engine is basically dumping
      energy into the torque converter in the form of friction. It is
      literally no different from holding the gas and the brakes at the
      same time.

      You could make the excuse that we love automatics because of all
      our stop-and-go traffic, and yet, as a citizen of the Midwestern
      U.S, I see automatics MUCH more often than I see traffic
      congestion.
    </para>
    <para>
      The real answer is that we just don‚Äôt want to bother with a clutch
      pedal and a gearshift when we could be texting or doing makeup.
    </para>
<literallayout>Luckily, the great minds of our time have come up with solutions that adapt to us so that we don‚Äôt have to adapt to them. (As always.) Probably the simplest is the aforementioned ‚Äúlock-up clutch,‚Äù which eliminates the inefficiency of the torque converter by mechanically coupling at high speed. But that doesn‚Äôt exactly solve the problem of sitting over a nice gas to friction converter at traffic lights.
Well here‚Äôs a tip. When you stop at a traffic light, bump your shift lever one up into neutral. It shouldn‚Äôt require that you hold a safety button to go back and forth between Drive and Neutral. This prevents that unnecessary friction. Combine that with a lockup clutch, and you‚Äôre basically driving a manual!‚Ä¶‚Ä¶Except without the enjoyment.</literallayout>

      You could call this a rant on one of the most successful
      inventions the modern automobile has ever seen‚Ä¶.because it is. And
      I doubt you‚Äôll hear anyone else complain about it. But there
      really are flaws in the design that I wish consumers would figure
      out. Before all this hybridism, eco-mindedness, and hippie-crazed
      green malarkey, maybe we should eliminate the evil energy-wasting
      beast that is the torque converter.

    <title>As we bid farewell to the Miata‚Äôs third-generation, sizing up
    its top trim summarizes its legacy.</title>
    <para>
      I recently had the chance to drive the facelifted 2013 Mazda MX-5.
      This is the first time the looks of the perky roadster have
      changed since the front-mounted smile became an all-out grin of
      insanity in 2008. They have once again dulled it to what I would
      call a smirk. The new front end blends with the rest of car more
      than it has in the past. It seems to have grown a bit more
      serious. In fact, with black 17-inch alloys on a glossy black
      (creatively called ‚ÄúBrilliant Black,‚Äù) this example is the most
      aggressive-looking of any Miata I have seen.
    </para>
    <para>
      That's not to say it's aggressive in the slightest, even in such a
      scheme. This car is in the ‚ÄúClub‚Äù trim replacing the previous
      ‚ÄúTouring‚Äù designation as the top-of-the-line option. This
      selection adds ridiculous three-leaf clover side badges, red
      stitching on the seats, red stripes on the dash and sides, along
      with a price tag very near 30,000 USD.

      So I present you with my first problem with this particular
      car....it's a contradiction. The MX-5 was never intended to look
      serious. That grin was there to convey the primary attribute
      aspired to by its creators; joy. It's designed to be joyful in
      driving and the exterior of previous generations did a good job of
      communicating what the car is all about. Unfortunately, it seems
      they have decided that it's time for the roadster to grow up.
      Frankly, that's not going to work.
    </para>
    <para>
      Now, to the drive.
    </para>
    <para>
      For this year, the car has been lightened, the braking response
      quickened, as well as the throttle response in manual-equipped
      cars. Unfortunately, I was only able to drive the 6-speed
      automatic with optional pattle-shifters. Given that this is my
      first drive in an NC (third generation) MX-5, I can only compare
      it to my own NB.

    <para>
      Immediately, my passenger and chaperon starts the process of
      opening the optional retractable hard top. Open air is this car's
      natural environment, and it appears that somebody got busy making
      sure its occupants never notice. Wind buffeting has been
      drastically reduced. We were able to maintain conversation beyond
      70mph without necessitating shouting thanks to a much taller wind
      brake behind our seats. Unfortunately, I couldn't really hear much
      of anything from the 158-hp 2.0L 4 up front, even with liberal
      amounts of right foot burying. It would seem the optional dual
      exhaust outlets are rather pointless then.

    <para>
      Getting in the car, I had expected the experience to be ruined by
      the 6-speed auto. Buying a Miata with an automatic is sort of like
      going on a scenic vacation without a camera. It doesn't
      necessarily ruin the immediate experience but you'll always have
      some regret regarding the subject in the future. The pattles add
      some of the fun back in, but I prefer the Golf GTI's arrangement
      of right side-shift up, left side-shift down, while the MX-5 has
      both functions on either side of the wheel.
    </para>
    <para>
      It took some deliberate self-coaching to get used to, but it won't
      effect your daily driving experience. Another plus; when in manual
      shift mode, it is truly manual, meaning the transmission will
      allow you to exceed the redline. It may sound trivial, but being
      nannied when you're first told that you're in control can be a
      major annoyance. (Looking at you, Kia Forte.) It's disappointing
      that Mazda chose only to up throttle response in manual-equipped
      cars. This one most certainly needed it.
    </para>
    <para>
      The original Miata was built on a philosophy of communication
      between driver and machine, summarized in the Japanese phrase
      ‚ÄúJinba Ittai,‚Äù meaning ‚Äúrider and horse are one.‚Äù Being an MX-5
      owner, this philosophy is very important to me, thus my
      expectations for the steering were very high. It was very
      disappointing, then, to discover that it has been very nearly
      ruined.

    <para>
      The leather-wrapped steering wheel was comfortable, yes, but not
      very generous in revealing the road. In corners it felt jumpy,
      imprecise, and unsure of itself. The same lack of self-confidence
      was noticeable in a straight line as well, along with a nervous
      fidget. Keep in mind, I am comparing this to roadsters of the
      past, not to other automobiles currently on the market. It would
      take a global nuclear war to make the MX-5 less fun to drive than
      a Toyota Camry.
    </para>
    <para>
      Though it has lost communication and soul, the Miata has gained a
      more comfortable suspension and oodles of storage space. The trunk
      is massive for a roadster of this size, and the example I drove
      was equipped with an optional storage compartment extending behind
      the seats, especially handy for CDs, candy, and the like. The
      center console contains two reasonably-sized cupholders obscured
      by a sliding door that will inevitably lead to annoyance in
      single-drink occasions. Mr. Cunningham also pointed out to me that
      the track on which the door slides appears vulnerable to crumbs.
      Only time will tell, I suppose.

    <para>
      In general, being inside the car is a much more comfortable
      experience, albeit a boring one. It seems to me that the MX-5 has
      ‚Äúgrown up,‚Äù forgoing fun for comfort and practicality. And is that
      not exactly the opposite of the direction it should be moving? It
      was never meant to be an aggressive-looking performance car, and
      it will never do well as one. It will never be luxurious enough to
      be a true touring car, either.
    </para>
    <para>
      Its soul has made it the top-selling roadster of all time, and I'm
      afraid it's losing it, bit by bit. To be honest, if you're
      attracted by the values on which the original Miata was built, I
      would recommend a Subaru BRZ/Toyota GT 86/Scion FR-S. The
      recommendation does not come lightly or easily.
    </para>
    <para>
      Until Mazda gets wise about what it's doing to the beloved little
      car, I'm afraid it's headed down a path that will mean losing a
      grip on the niche it's held for so long, and that's quite
      saddening.

    <para>
      The 1990s. Not the greatest time for the United States auto
      industry. In those days, with a few exceptions, American cars were
      all overpriced, devoid of quality and generally unreliable. The
      big three (along with many other non-automotive related
      corporations in the U.S.) had an aging generation of management.
      This group decided that the ideal way to run their business
      involved expending the least amount of effort into their products
      as possible, without reducing the price paid by customers.
      Essentially, they hoped to gain more profit from less product. I
      don't have to tell you that this thinking just...doesn't work. I
      would theorize that this mentality came from overconfidence and a
      lack of joy in production. GM, Ford, and Dodge had been the top
      sellers of the automobile in the United States since its
      invention. They originally symbolized the best in quality, luxury
      and performance. Consumer and producer shared the same values,
      resulting in a flourishing market. It was a joyous time. And then,
      somewhere around the 1973 oil crisis, the joy began seeping out of
      our star shooters. Maybe it was emissions regulations, a loss of
      those ideal values, or some other factor. Regardless of the
      source, our homegrown auto industry lost its passion. It reflected
      in the cars that were built. Designs were reused, progression was
      halted, the irreverence of quality workmanship lost. ‚ÄúAmerican
      dependability‚Äù became an ironic statement.
    </para>
    <para>
      And then came along a company that had been building little, noisy
      two-stroke engines to fit to bicycles only four decades earlier,
      proudly displaying a banner the changing public couldn't refuse.
      They offered a product that was simple, honest, reliable, durable
      and reasonably priced. A concoction that smelled an awful lot like
      high value. An odor that no doubt brought back old memories. The
      Accord, suburban America's new family pet. And the Civic,
      conveniently debuted in 1972. The college student's greatest
      companion. Both were conservatively styled and equipped, and thus
      quite easily ignored, which was exactly what the country wanted.
      After all those years stranded on the shoulders of our aging
      interstate system in lumbering, underpowered beasts, the
      indestructible and dependable qualities of the Hondas came as a
      breath of fresh air. So. What made the newcomers so different?
      What was the driving force behind the value of the products? It
      was something not unknown to the Americans, and its presence had
      been sorely missed. Picture an ancient sage by the name of
      Soichiro Honda saying something to the order of ‚ÄúLets build the
      best automobile we can and sell it for as little as possible.‚Äù
      Though the man is more a symbol than an actual influence on the
      four-wheeled endeavors of the institution bearing his name, he
      represents what led to the same group's success. Honda was
      untainted by an unrealistic attitude, and unaided by a century of
      heritage and good reputation. They succeeded only because they
      built good cars.

      By 2008, Honda had more than made a name for itself. Over the past
      decade, though, the prices had been steadily increasing, along
      with the level of luxury and complexity available in their cars.
      Both the Accord and Civic were bestsellers in their respective
      classes, and had held their titles for a relatively long time. It
      was then that I personally theorized they might take the same path
      American carmakers had taken only a short while before. I don't
      want to brag, but this was long before Ron Kiino's bold title ‚ÄúIs
      Hyundai the new Honda?‚Äù graced the pages of MotorTrend's October
      2011 issue. And it was really a far-fetched notion at the time.
      Simply a suspicion. Confidently and stubbornly, the Accord held
      its grip on mid-size sedan sales in the United States,
      complimented by the Toyota Camry, a similar-looking but even more
      ignorable competitor. The former still held appeal for someone
      with the capacity to enjoy themselves. The latter, however, has
      always been the most desirable choice of individuals that
      absolutely despise driving. They both held their slightly
      different niches, with no real fear of losing their place. Then,
      Honda started skimping a bit on quality. Motoring journalists
      noticed a lack of improving fuel economy, aging transmissions, and
      a general loss in competitive edge in the 2011 Accord. Not the
      best time to start slacking on Honda's part.

      This was the year that Hyundai unveiled the brilliantly-updated
      6th generation Sonata. I consider this to be the most significant
      car to come in the mid-sized segment since the birth of the
      Accord/Camry duo. In previous generations, it had always been
      competitively priced. The quality, though, had been lacking. The
      Koreans were not afraid to design a car that was much less
      conservative than the two Japanese giants. However, the designs
      were never really all that great looking. Interesting and
      different? Yes. Attractive?....No. So these attributes kept Honda
      and Toyota secure under their cozy comforter of sales, not
      intimidated by Hyundai's offering. And that's quite
      understandable. The Sonata never really seemed a direct competitor
      to the giants. The new one, however, completely changed the game.
      For one thing, it's gorgeous. Not conservatively pretty, but
      ridiculous, in the best sort of way. Poised and angular, the
      exterior looks as if it should cost exponentially more than it
      does. They managed to carry on the Sonata's tradition of unique
      styling by rejecting the old car completely and replacing it with
      a stunner. The interior reflects a similar attitude. It's not only
      good looking, but significantly more fuel efficient than any other
      mid-sized car on the market. The drivetrain options are excellent.
      The best part, though, is the price. At a starting MSRP of 19,195
      USD (¬£11,944), it is several thousand less than any competitor.

      All of this really just makes the Accord and Camry look silly.
      It's interesting that Hyundai should take up Honda's original
      niche, given how different their backgrounds are. Our original
      hero of practicality was created by a man tinkering with small
      motorcycles. The former, however, was founded as a massive
      construction firm, only later trying its hand in the realm of
      automobiles. Cars seemed an alternative for Hyundai, but certainly
      not an afterthought. Regardless of where they came from, these two
      companies have had very similar philosophies, if only separated by
      time. Also, both have had to rely on sheer ingenuity for profit,
      without the foothold of heritage in the American market. It could
      be said, though, that Hyundai is doing a bit better. High value
      cars that are practical and interesting as an experience. Honda
      could never get that last bit quite right. Or perhaps it's just a
      sign of the times. Maybe Americans have overcome the compulsion to
      ignore our cars. My question is this; Has this flip-flop in
      production attitude become a cycle? And if so, who will be in the
      hot spot next? My bet is on the big three, believe it or not. A
      new generation of management has brought about a huge improvement
      in our products. It could even be one of the rising Chinese
      companies in the future. Who knows? I can tell you that right now,
      though, Hyundai has got the goods.

      its immobility, and the stories I was told combined to create the
      aura of a fading, forgotten superhero. Tired, abandoned, and only
      necessitating the help of a friend in order to bring it back to
      glory.

      It wasn't very long after toddlerhood that I took to spending a
      large portion of my free time sitting in the RX-7, practicing
      rowing through the gears and making engine noises with my mouth. I
      still remember vividly how delightful the experience of simply
      sitting in that car was. The dash layout, the feel of the steering
      wheel in my hands, and the smell of the interior are all deeply
      etched into memory. It was almost as if I had a deeper perception
      into its soul, a capability that I feel has been lost.

      Much before I had expected, I had the opportunity to meet this
      hero, so to speak. I encountered a partially-restored 1983 Series
      2 example, slightly different than my RX-7. Different enough to
      subdue my worries of adultery to the car I grew up with, but
      similar enough to be an important discovery.

      I was treated to the complete RX-7 ownership experience, including
      a dead battery and a difficult, choked cold start. Perry, my host,
      was kind enough to pay for the fuel for the drive with money out
      of his own pocket. After ensuring that we would not be walking
      back, I pointed that very long, very 80s nose toward some local
      back highways.

      I had never driven anything powered by a Wankel, and the contrast
      of the RX-7 compared to everything with wheels I had experienced
      was stark, and noticeable immediately. The feedback normally
      received from a piston engine is not felt, due to the fact that
      there is no more conversion from vertical to rotational motion, a
      rotary engine (as implied by the name) involves no vertical
      momentum. It's not that the engine refuses to communicate with
      you, it's just speaking an entirely different language. The whiny
      exhaust note has an odd property to it that can be heard from no
      other source. It conjures up images of the mysterious, angry pair
      of triangles whirling about in their cage. Purely imaginary, of
      course.
    </para>
    <para>
      Because the Wankel is so smooth, I found myself wondering why I
      should shift up. A piston engine makes you anxious when you push
      it close to the redline. Most send the driver a variety of
      auditory and tactile messages indicating that they must either
      shift up, or face a molten tie rod to the head. The RX-7, however,
      gives no such indication. When close to the redline, one hears
      only an excited whir. The result (forgive the upcoming Disney
      analogy) is an almost magic carpet-like experience. It's as though
      the power simply materializes before you with no apparent source
      or sacrifice.

      For me, the tranquility of the engine eliminated the reservations
      I had for speed. It's an incentive, in fact, to keep the needle in
      the upper portion of the tachometer as much as possible. The car
      had only 100 hp and 105 lb-ft. of torque in 1983, and has no doubt
      lost a few along its journey. Frankly, I'm thankful it's not more
      powerful. Otherwise, there wouldn't be room to fully enjoy revving
      it to its limit.
    </para>
    <para>
      Though I have decided that a transmission with multiple ratios is
      unnecessary when coupled to a Wankel, the 5-speed manual in the
      RX-7 was quite a treat. It's very notchy, with a mid-length throw.
      The well-spaced ratios paired with a very light, but engaging
      clutch made rev matching pleasant and natural.
    </para>
    <para>
      Unfortunately, the steering in the car I drove was quite loose,
      likely from wear. It is unassisted, though, and was at one time
      very engaging, I suspect. Given that it is a sports car from the
      1980s, driver communication is a result of the engineering, not
      vice versa.

      The driving position is actually more relaxed than it looks, and
      the interior is a thoroughly enjoyable place to be in. This
      particular car had a factory-installed manually-adjustable
      equalizer mounted beneath the stock head unit. A useless, though
      interesting, novelty that quickly rids the occupants of any doubt
      as to when the car was built.

      The RX-7 is too often overlooked for what it is; a very special
      piece of automotive history. It's an experience completely unlike
      any piston-powered alternative. And for me, it's much more than
      that. My RX-7 represents an entire childhood's worth of dreams and
      a sort of companionship, even. My experiences with it were a very
      large influence on my drive to pursue a career in automotive
      writing. Driving one did change my perspective, but not at all for
      the worse.

      I tried my senile best to be passionate about ‚Äúthe new

      I don‚Äôt think I finished a single web article on the subject. I
      had begun my brief return to <emphasis>The Old Republic</emphasis>
      when the hilted lightsaber image was leaked and distinctly
      remember overhearing some very weary VoIP exasperation from my
      (VERY middle-aged) raid group. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not gonna be the same, but
      neither was J.J.‚Äòs <emphasis>Star Trek</emphasis>, and I liked

      I grew up rurally, so the only available alternative to local
      channels was in the stupendously-tedious delivery of early
      satellite television. Though it was quite clumsy, it did offer the
      first accessible program schedule I‚Äôd ever experienced, and I
      remember dreading the sight of such titles and‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääconsciously or
      not‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääplanning my free time around them. Yet, upon hearing the
      words, I was intrigued! All that time ago, I watched many of them
      again and again‚Ä¶and again, so why did I feel the desire to
      <emphasis>voluntarily</emphasis> revisit them?
    </para>
    <para>
      It‚Äôs quite simple, actually. I was even more of an ignorant film
      consumer in my elementary years than I am now. I couldn‚Äôt have
      foreseen that instead of flying commercial jets, twenty-something
      me would be <emphasis>paying</emphasis> for the affliction I
      endured for free so that he could construct pretentious and
      unsolicited arguments about their greater implications.

      obsessed with artificial intelligence since those days (no, it was
      not due to this film,) and was keen for it, in particular, because
      I remembered it stirring some rare reaction in me. There were a
      few period spectacles, of course. The online contest addiction
      plaguing Prickly Phisher, Bewildered Nick‚Äôs incompetence in
      controlling his neglected submissive sadomasochistic desires, and
      Silkroad Sarah‚Äôs ultra-datamouth were enough to entertain us for a
      few minutes, but there was little more of substance until the last
      moments.

    <title>The recently-discontinued Nissan Murano CrossCabriolet darkly

      My Nissan wheeltime for
      <link xlink:href="http://bit.ly/dbhonkyt"><emphasis>Honk</emphasis></link>
      has grown a massive respect for the brand‚Äôs audacity within me. My
      interest in the profession has spanned years of maturity‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääfrom

      Throughout the years, Nissan has over and over again made me look
      like an absolutely absurd idiot for your display‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääand I cannot

      the ultimate muse.

      Just since its assembly in 2011, our example‚Äôs trim has endured
      enough to begin disintegrating in a few bizarre locales. Not to
      over-iterate, but it‚Äôs needing strong mention: I had never sat in
      a roofless crossover before. I‚Äôm assuming you haven‚Äôt, either. It
      is unnatural. It is harrowing.

      (in past tense, thank God,) proclaims ‚Äúthe Murano CrossCabriolet

      in peace and eternally-inadequate glory) as the last available
      SUV, in the traditional use of the segment, or the Juke NISMO as
      the first competently-composed automotive product for millennial
      youth. Or the GT-R as by far the most effective, high-value
      instrument for the pursuit of maximum velocity across the ground.

      The language so assured, the parallels must inevitably be drawn to

    </para>
    <para>
      The details of its life story are reliably amusing, should you
      find yourself mid-research. From the journos‚Äô gasps at its
      corporately-edgy concept‚Äôs unveiling to the weary original steed
      of <emphasis>Breaking Bad</emphasis>‚Äòs Meth Man, there is a
      similar <emphasis>lifestyle vehicle</emphasis> thread between the
      products that weaves an obscure narrative.
    </para>
    <para>
      My own contribution: after a missed exit outside Galveston just as
      Azteks first became rentable, my stepfather (the most earnestly
      late-history Pontiac man who ever lived) took an
      entirely-unexpected and uncharacteristic 70 mile-an-hour plunge
      into the choppy grass median after shouting ‚Äúthis is an off-road
      vehicle!‚Äù
    </para>
    <para>
      As I‚Äôm sure you can imagine, it was the single most traumatic
      event I have ever experienced as the passenger of a motor vehicle,
      but the damned thing was unscathed, despite having repeatedly
      chucked us all (fully-belted) into its beige ceiling.

      And you know what? His faith, too, has made me look like an idiot.
    </para>
    <para>
      That‚Äôs what separates the Aztek from ye late CrossCabriolet: it
      really was a genuinely-<emphasis>bold</emphasis> innovation.
      Survive the laymen‚Äôs idle party chat and crude design critiques,
      and you‚Äôll find an impressive clarity in its purpose, especially
      given the context of its conception. In the used market
      especially, it <emphasis>still</emphasis> represents a
      characterful, practical, and high-value consideration. And
      yet‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääat the expense of themselves‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäAmerican buyers did not
      clamor for it like the informed of the populace did. Perhaps it
      was because the informed‚Ää‚Äî‚Äälike

      for print, I stumbled upon an author and ‚Äúbook designer‚Äù engaged
      in launching a community for self-published, independent writers.
      I'm not going to specify names because I have no interest in
      shitting on his company, nor ‚Äúwhat it stands for.‚Äù I don't want to
      shit for you at all, actually, just note a few still-underrealized
      realities about the sheer ludicrousness of the word business as it
      stands. Let's say you've got some manuscripts you've been sitting
      on for a few years, and you're introduced to the concept of
      self-publishing by an evermore earnestly-curious man on the radio
      named Audie one day. He and his interviewee (the owner of a
      self-publishing service) seem to say, curiously, that because an
      author's profit-per-unit can potentially be ‚Äúfour to five times
      more‚Äù than if he/she is published traditionally, self-publishing
      has now shed completely its aura of desperate amateurism.
    </para>
    <para>
      But ‚Äì whoa, Nelly ‚Äì writing to sell books, and writing books have
      perhaps never been further apart. And gee ‚Äì you certainly didn't
      write to sell; selling hadn't occurred to you at all for a very
      long time, but from just one search, you find Our Friend, back
      from his own experiences as an author and editor, qualified and
      insistent that you <emphasis>can</emphasis> make money selling
      creative works of fiction.
    </para>
    <para>
      And Jesus Christ‚Ä¶ All that said, I must admit to you that I've
      just finished Kurt Vonnegut's <emphasis>Breakfast of
      Champions</emphasis>, and was unable to commence this ‚Äúreview‚Äù
      without wondering aloud for you how Kilgore Trout ‚Äì perhaps Kurt's
      favorite creation ‚Äì would feel about this Friend's business.
    </para>
    <para>
      It was actually my Aunt Ayn who taught me to write, so Vonegutt
      was a mediocre Ray William Johnson-associated
      <link xlink:href="https://youtu.be/zAtBEhKU7uw">YouTube
      band</link> until after high school, when ‚Äúlots of people‚Äù started
      telling me to ‚Äúread Vonnegut, man,‚Äù even though I cannot recall
      any specific events or recommenders. For whatever reason, though,
      I'd bought a copy immediately after a friend mentioned it,
      recently, and found him (in this particular work, at least) to be
      awfully sane for my taste, yet particularly resonant. Though
      written to make me think it was all a big one-draft ramble, Kurt's
      a bit too curt for it to be believed, I think. Auntie Rand
      would've double-taken his beratement of ‚Äúin nonsense is strength‚Äù
      if she'd made it that far. I hope she did, because I found the
      image of her taking in his occasional hand doodles to be very
      amusing.
    </para>
    <para>
      Dwayne Hoover is awfully absent ‚Äì and therefore, a very versatile
      storytelling device, though not in a lazy sense. We're repeatedly
      notified about an imminent convergence. Eventually, it's explained
      that the endgame involves Dwayne exploding into a violent
      revengeful tantrum against all the lifelong enemies of his
      subconscious. Including ‚Äúpeople with brown skin.‚Äù Can I just bring
      up Ayn Rand again? I hope it's okay.
    </para>
    <para>
      Kilgore Trout is the most dangerous villain I've ever experienced.
      He has little to lose, and ‚Äì like Vonnegut, it would seem ‚Äì finds
      his observatory position in the world to be immensely amusing. His
      last amusement, even. Remember Ellsworth M. Toohey, the corrupter?
      I think they would've gotten along, funny enough.
    </para>
    <para>
      Yes, and Hoover would be Peter Keating, the corrupted. I'm
      reaching, yeah, but when do I not? Their immediate difference is
      the lack of malicious intent in Trout, of course. He is an aimless
      science fiction writer, who gives Dwayne a volume simply to shut
      him up. Neither villain is believable, per se, but both were
      written to be personifications of ideals; vehicles of metaphor.
    </para>
    <para>
      I think Rand could've quite easily become Vonnegut, were she to
      stick around much longer, but perhaps I believe so only because
      I've experienced a quantifiable transition from her sort of
      thinking (vaguely) to his (perhaps less vaguely.) An incorruptible
      commitment to <emphasis>absolute</emphasis> was Ayn's most potent
      conviction. Growing up as a white cis male, I was aching for a
      method of simplifying the world which I knew more and more to be
      infinitely complex. Inevitably, with age, I think a limitless
      appetite for the complexity must form, lest one spend the rest of
      his/her life fighting the singular truth in a miserable fortress
      of seclusion and amphetamine abuse.
    </para>
    <para>
      The key to <emphasis>Breakfast of Champions</emphasis>' genius is
      its utter lack of angst. Aside from his brief definition of a
      being ‚Äì ‚Äúan unwavering band of light‚Äù ‚Äì Kurt had little interest
      in writing a manifesto, yet his perspective in his curious
      commentary manifests a much more profound critique of American
      society than Rand ever could've from her hole.
    </para>
    <para>
      As such, I think it's wisest to leave a rudimentary whole
      measurement of a writer to Aunt Ayn, but perhaps a particularly
      relevant spectrum in this case is clarity of sight. Rigid idealism
      has its place in literature, no doubt, but it's an awfully boring
      one without a writer's feet on the ground.
    </para>
    <para>
      How does this all relate to self-publication? Well, Our Friend, it
      turns out, offers preset novel ‚Äútemplates‚Äù to members of his
      writing community, into which one can ‚Äúplug in‚Äù characters,
      setting, and basic plot elements to a degree of his/her choosing.
      And his YouTube channel is stuffed with all sorts of tutorials on
      formatting and ‚Äì more disturbingly ‚Äì how to create sellable cover
      art with Photoshop. Naturally, it includes instruction on stock
      and rights-free images.
    </para>
    <para>
      Though I've yet to read one, it doesn't take much imagination to
      comprehend the inevitable product. From Our Friend's vlogs, I can
      suppose a heavy focus on the adolescent market. What makes the
      whole concept noteworthy in my mind is the
      <emphasis>why?</emphasis> I'd like to think that I have a
      fairly-realistic grasp on the potentialities of writing for
      profit, and am obligated to wonder why one would ‚Äúcompromise‚Äù
      his/her ‚Äúcreative integrity‚Äù by publishing
      <emphasis>literature</emphasis> to sell, of all things.
    </para>
    <para>
      As I understand it, the methodical approach to authorship being
      encouraged is applicable to literally <emphasis>any</emphasis>
      other field, creative or not. It's curious and impressive,
      frankly, as their sales potential seems to be vastly superior to
      anything I'll ever bother to publish, but I must weigh in because
      of one quantifiable detriment: saturation.
    </para>
    <para>
      Someone is spending their money on these works ‚Äì probably for
      their kids. I'm not a parent, but I'd be tremendously ashamed to
      discover that a book I'd given as a gift to
      <emphasis>anyone</emphasis> had been manufactured in this manner.
      Not just in the sense that most light literature is
      <emphasis>manufactured</emphasis> ‚Äì written in hearty observance
      of academic rules of storytelling ‚Äì but
      <emphasis>literally</emphasis> mass-produced with a goddamned
      intellectual stencil.
    </para>
    <para>
      Without sounding like I'm complaining... My singular
      self-published poetry collection is probably of significantly less
      whole-value to the majority of readers, but I can't help but think
      the effort put into its hand-drawn cover art and
      meticulously-arranged typography would make it a more
      <emphasis>comfortable</emphasis> investment, if anything else.
    </para>
    <para>
      This brings us to a distinctly-academic mainstay which I have
      always taken issue with: ‚Äúconsider your audience.‚Äù I first
      encountered this proverb in the context of a composition studies
      course, mind you, where its consideration in the essay medium
      makes unequivocally good sense. If we agree that an essay is
      defined by an uncompromising commitment to its effectiveness in
      making an argument, audience awareness is essential. If you were
      asked to decide on one primary purpose of writing in general,
      though, would it not be identical?
    </para>
    <para>
      Why didn't Kurt Vonnegut or Ayn Rand simply write essays? Well,
      the latter wrote many, but their sales have always been all but
      invisible compared to <emphasis>The Fountainhead</emphasis> and
      <emphasis>Atlas Shrugged.</emphasis> (Both of which resemble
      essays more than fiction, at times, but I'll spare you that
      conversation.) Did they consider their audience? Certainly not in
      the way
      <link xlink:href="http://writingcommons.org/open-text/writing-processes/think-rhetorically/712-consider-your-audience">my
      first Google result</link> articulates it:
    </para>

        your readers.‚Äù

    </blockquote>
    <para>
      Ooo boy. To me, that translates a little too easily into ‚Äúwrite
      what your readers want to read.‚Äù And maaaan... If there's anything
      that experience and Donald Draper have taught me, it's that people
      have no idea what they want, especially from art. And that's a
      reasonable mentality, isn't it? Perhaps even an exhaltable one. I
      know that predictable stories are my number one turnoff,
      personally. If I expected to exist for an eternity, I'd absolutely
      indulge every single creative work I could find, but I do not, and
      that realization (as I stated in my last <emphasis>Freq
      Check</emphasis>,) has propelled an underlying preference in all
      of my consumption decisions: what I have not (before) seen.
    </para>
    <para>
      Obviously, then ‚Äì if you take my word for it ‚Äì Our Friend's
      endeavors are in direct ideological opposition to my own, which
      would make him my arch nemesis, if 21st-century industry were a
      bit more theatrical. But ‚Äì like most heroic protagonists ‚Äì I'd be
      much more interested in ‚Äúturning‚Äù him than censoring him, were we
      ever to engage. In fact, I'd probably end up defending his and/or
      his constituents' right to sell their trash if CreateSpace or
      other self-publishing services called it into question.
    </para>
    <para>
      Overwhelming content volume can be entertaining; Drywall was my
      own foray into that uniquely contemporary experiment. It's the
      sheer ease of publication, though, that makes ‚Äúgood‚Äù literature
      more precious than ever. Admittedly, a glance at Amazon's current
      top ten bestsellers list indicates that I am undoubtedly out of
      touch as far as the market is concerned. I know that my mother and
      sisters have mysteriously reverted back to print from the Kindles
      which they used for a few years, and that audiobooks make me
      supremely uncomfortable. I also know that reading a book ‚Äì
      whenever I bring myself to shut out everything else ‚Äì is an
      unrivaled vehicle of cognitive serenity.

      A significant mission for <emphasis>Extratone</emphasis> lies in
      an upcoming reactionary movement to culture's ‚Äúcircus stage‚Äù (by
      way of the Internet.) We determined the event's inevitability on
      <emphasis>Drycast</emphasis>, a year ago, and have made occasional
      efforts to posit more thoroughly on <emphasis>The New</emphasis>.
      It must involve a reduction in content consumption, fundamentally,
      which will constrict because of an increasing demand for more
      explicit purpose in all media. We are not to be the alternative,
      necessarily, but the intermediary arbiter of the enabling
      discussion, hopefully with the outcome of increased awareness.

      As the end of <emphasis>Breakfast of Champions</emphasis> draws
      abruptly closer, Vonnegut mentions his schizophrenia, which is ‚Äì
      as you probably know ‚Äì fundamentally characterized by loss of the
      ability to determine what is and is not real, and primarily
      treated with antipsychotics. Interestingly enough, extremely high
      doses of amphetamines (which Ayn Rand <emphasis>did</emphasis> use
      heavily, by the way. I wasn't making that up) can actually
      <emphasis>induce</emphasis> psychosis, which could crudely be
      described as <emphasis>cognitive noise</emphasis>. I could've
      missed the intended function of their works, but for me, they
      illuminate a distinct relationship between the abstracts of
      <emphasis>truth</emphasis> and <emphasis>relevance</emphasis>
      which, for the moment, seems particularly necessary.

      Thanks to this week's September 2016 Keynote, we now know that iOS
      10 will be officially released in just three days. I suppose it
      was a bit silly of me to download the
      <link xlink:href="http://www.imore.com/how-to-download-ios-10-public-beta">public
      beta</link> so late in the game, but I did, and regret it
      <emphasis>much</emphasis> less than I could've imagined.
    </para>
    <para>
      I've used my rose gold iPhone 6S Plus more than any personal
      device I've ever owned. For the first time in my functioning life,
      I've had no persistent need for a laptop, which is a pretty big
      deal for reasons you couldn't care less about.
    </para>
    <para>
      Ownership of my first generation iPhone trained me to dread new
      releases. Expectedly, it got less and less usable every time
      Stevie took the stage. For relevance's sake, I decided to opt in a
      bit early, despite my assumption that my 6S Plus would show its
      first signs of struggle as a result.
    </para>
    <para>
      Immediately, though, the opposite effect was noticeable.
      Everything is faster: notifications, app opening/closing,
      intra-app function, and <emphasis>text entry,</emphasis> even.
      Smoother, too ‚Äì so much so, it's almost a shame we've had to use
      iOS 9 on these devices for a whole year. The effect of such
      smoothing on my perception should be kept in consideration when
      reading the rest of my opining.
    </para>
    <para>
      <emphasis role="strong">Raise to wake</emphasis> is less
      tedious/more useful than I anticipated, though it's been briefly
      mistriggered a few times in transit from inside my Moshi Overture
      Wallet Case (an extraordinary product, by the way,) but it should
      be noted that I walk and carry my phone rather strangely. With
      relatively default sleep/wake settings, I did not notice enough
      mistriggering to have quantifiable power consequences.
    </para>
    <para>
      <emphasis role="strong">Messages</emphasis> is
      appropriately-complex for the times, now, if that makes sense. The
      pressure to ‚Äúcompete‚Äù with Snapchat, Facebook Messenger,
      What'sApp, etc. is understandable, but the execution of their
      reply is not. For me, at least, there is simply nothing to add to
      SMS. Its role is purely functional. I wasn't able to try out many
      of the new features. Not just because nobody else had iOS 10, but
      because ‚Äì critically ‚Äì I could not think of someone I'd be willing
      to bother with useless garbage like... a doodle. And even if I
      could've, it's probably actually <emphasis>less</emphasis> trouble
      to use one of those third-party applications in that Application
      Shop Apple has been so proud of for so long. For old people like
      me, even cleverly stowed buttons for unused features are
      <emphasis>still buttons</emphasis>. It feels an awful lot like an
      obligatory alteration, not a visionary one, and it's a shame that
      Apple's losing its awareness of the appropriate time for one, the
      other, or neither.
    </para>
    <para>
      I feel like competence in coverage of Apple is heavily dependent
      upon the ability to differentiate between the allure of an
      intelligently blingy feature and the allure of an intelligently
      functional one. Crude, I know, but ever more essential.
      <emphasis role="strong">Contextual predictions</emphasis> are
      impressive and surprisingly-clever. It's encouraging to see
      progress in such simple interactions, but ‚Äì be honest with
      yourself ‚Äì making use of it is actually going to cost you time in
      the majority of cases. Hate to be excessively meta here, but keep
      in mind ‚Äì again ‚Äì that I am not the majority. I tend to type
      things out... It's my thing. If this is completely obscuring my
      vision of any of these features' uselessness,
      <emphasis>please</emphasis> take the time to add to the discussion
      in the comments. Discourse is the handiest security in such

      I've loved 3D Touch all along, even though something like 75% of

      <emphasis>very</emphasis> useful for quickly grabbing web images,
      but I'm probably more of a thief than you'll ever be. Mostly, I
      just like the sensation. The curt vibration and brittle illusion
      of a third interactive dimension have provided more functionality
      than... its actual functionality. With
      <emphasis role="strong">touch and go</emphasis>, though, I can
      instantly conjure a concise summary of the current local weather
      conditions, <emphasis>and</emphasis> a singular story from Apple
      News. Though I'm undoubtedly going to need to make a conscious

      As to <emphasis role="strong">Apple News</emphasis> itself... It's
      just not the same application. The ‚ÄúFor You‚Äù roll was amusingly
      messy before but actual structure (read: functional aggregation)
      has killed some of its beauty, I'm afraid. It is
      <emphasis>so</emphasis> much faster, though. We'll actually have
      to take it seriously, now.

      I suspect the ability to <emphasis role="strong">search photos by

      Though I have many audiophilical sentiments and preferences, I
      cannot‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääby conscience‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääfully claim the title because I‚Äôve never
      been able to justify the allotment of funds necessary for the
      obligatory equipment. (And my digital compressor usage in the
      production of
      <link xlink:href="http://extratone.com/drycast"><emphasis>Drycast</emphasis></link>
      and
      <link xlink:href="http://extratone.com/futureland"><emphasis>Futureland</emphasis></link>
      has been manifestly vulgar.) That said, audio engineering is one
      of the few topics which I can actually speak on with
      almost-academic authority, and my pretentiousness-capacitated
      preoccupation with quality-of-life compels me to bring up a
      ludicrously-rational standard that most of us have continued to
      undershoot for far too long.

      Two weeks ago, the abundantly-rumored omission of the 3.5mm audio
      port in the iPhone 7 was finally settled. We played our own part
      in feeding the ‚Äúcontroversy,‚Äù yeah, but I believe Apple was
      actually quite tardy in labeling smartphone-bound analog audio as
      archaic, though I‚Äôm not going to waste words in that
      discussion‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääit is definitely oversaturated, at this
      point‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääbecause I think mono audio is an even more prevalent
      topic.
    </para>
    <para>
      Honestly, out of all the missing features we‚Äôve lamented over in
      the past decade, stereo speakers should‚Äôve been the most
      aggravating. The gigantic difference, of course, is that the
      industry (and‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääby muddled extension‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääthe consumers) has been all
      but silent in that regard. I write you, now, because we should all
      be colossally disappointed with ourselves.

    <para>
      Two channels. Left and right. Read:
      <link xlink:href="http://www.diffen.com/difference/Mono_vs_Stereo">Mono

      Google‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääsomehow‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääfailed to provide you with a significant

    </para>
    <para>
      One channel of sound is‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääin terms of locale‚Ää‚Äî‚Äärigidly static in
      your perception. Doubling the data creates a spectrum, adding
      <emphasis role="strong">dimensionality</emphasis>, which is
      infinite, ya know. Playing back audio in stereo, through two or
      more diaphragms (the fundamental hardware unit of sound
      reproduction,) now enables the exhibition of
      <emphasis role="strong">audio pictures</emphasis>.

      If this is entirely new to you, I want you to do something. Find

      system. If it‚Äôs at all current and healthy, it‚Äôs gonna do the
      trick.) Bother to discover ‚Äú<emphasis role="strong">L</emphasis>‚Äù

      with my Zoom H2n. (Be advised: the preview is formatted in 5.1
      surround, so it‚Äôs a very large file for its playback length.)
      Listen, obviously, and then listen again on your singular

      <emphasis role="strong">That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm talking about.</emphasis>

    <para>
      Why am I being so abashedly patronizing? Why am I transgressing
      against our particular assumptions about you‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääthe informed, savvy
      millennial audience? Because the vast majority of playback I hear
      in day-to-day life is still from a singular diaphragm; a singular
      source.
    </para>
    <para>
      A topical example: <emphasis>I am shown a YouTube video on an
      iPhone</emphasis>. (A pre-iPhone 7 device, that is.)
    </para>
    <para>
      <emphasis>Walking downtown, I pass a small band of adolescent
      skateboarders listening to Cannibal Ox on a Samsung Galaxy
      Note.</emphasis>

    <para>
      Worst of all: <emphasis>I find myself watching a Netflix film on
      my iPhone, in bed, not having bothered to wear the $200 pair of
      QC15s sitting within arm‚Äôs length.</emphasis>
    </para>
    <para>
      Informed or not, <emphasis role="strong">consumers are neglecting
      audio</emphasis>, and dimensionality, alone is worth a change.
      Recent years have allowed the unlimited bandwidth assumption to
      become habit, so even the vast majority of today‚Äôs spoken word
      programs (like podcasts)‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääwhich, in general, stay in the ‚Äúcenter‚Äù
      of their mix, making little to no use of the left-right
      spectrum‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääare produced in stereo, now. In many cases (including a
      few of ours,) this doublesizing is often for the sake of
      introductory themes, alone. If you care to imagine a more
      data-frugal society, the ‚Äúwaste‚Äù is ridiculous. It is not
      unrealistic to expect such a reality in the near future, but the
      same holds true for the reverse.
    </para>
    <para>
      In the present‚Äôs abundance, though, the result is simply a
      decrease‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääas a whole‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääin playback‚Äôs ‚Äúfull experience,‚Äù if the
      hardware is not changed. Imagine how great it‚Äôd be if a digital
      audio formatting standard could be developed that‚Äôd enable a
      singular file to be mono or stereo, if needed/utilized, to trim
      off redundancy, sorta like variable bit rate. Get on that, would
      ya?
    </para>
    <para>
      So, why haven‚Äôt we become more diligent about our sound
      experiences? 1 billion iPhones in circulation, all with mono
      playback by default, are suspect culprits, I think. Of course,
      there are other devices, but none as influential‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääeven the iPod,
      funny enough‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääon fundamental digital functions like music
      playback. And honestly, when is it appropriate or suave to take
      the extra steps?

    <para>
      It‚Äôs never going to be socially acceptable. But what about
      wireless alternatives? Apple‚Äôs new Air Pods look absurd, but their
      by-computing optimization of the Bluetooth audio standard is
      revolutionary, in a small way, in

      the ‚Äúhearables‚Äù paradigm into the mainstream, if only for a
      moment. If‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääin a strangely-audiocentric future‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääwe are
      <emphasis>always</emphasis> wearing multipurpose sound
      reproduction devices in our ears, perhaps the waste of the Mono
      Monstrosity will be finally resolved. Until then, I suppose all we
      can do is give it an extra thought, for our own quality-of-life‚Äôs
      sake.

      ‚ÄúThe Great Debate‚Äù was an ultimate test‚Ää‚Äî‚Äänot of television‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääbut

      Today, we are to extrapolate in the journey we‚Äôve taken in the 56
      years hence, into‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääby any standard of measure‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääanother world,
      entirely. Most importantly, into one with such
      gigantically-swelling intellectual disparity that it cannot
      possibly be monitored accurately, even moment-to-moment. The

      conducive to the fact.

    <para>
      My bias is here: I genuinely believe sociopathic traits make for
      effective leaders, and am unable to respect anyone without control
      over their public persona. Trump‚Äôs defining acceptance of his
      undisciplined whirling relegates him‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääfor POTUS, especially‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääto
      nothing more than an amusement. He is incapable of the duties that
      define the position as I know it. (e.g. a

      No, America, I am not. And‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääforgive my patronization‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääneither

      review</link> of the HP Spectre x360. As I‚Äôve constantly
      confessed, <emphasis>The Verge</emphasis>‚Äòs lot are the only
      institution of their kind I‚Äôve come close to trusting
      <emphasis>too much</emphasis>, so it was no small thing to see
      something so certain as ‚Äúthe premium laptop to buy this year‚Äù in
      his subhead.

      The last time I was in the market for a laptop, there was little
      room for aesthetics in the equation. We have been taught this past
      decade that beautiful devices come in fruit form, only. Somehow, I
      allowed myself to integrate the ridiculous sentiment that MacBooks
      were the only option for anyone with any reverence for tactile
      experience. As I expect you‚Äôre aware of to at least some degree by
      now, Apple‚Äôs diligent study of desirability over the years is the
      singular force behind their lordship, and it‚Äôs the token MO of
      tech opinion to confuse it with sex appeal, resulting in
      expressions like ‚Äú[apple hardware device] is sexy,‚Äù which is a
      pityingly desperate delusion. Do you actually find brushed
      aluminum appealing in any bodily sense?
    </para>
    <para>
      We did once, of course. Your infatuation with the stuff probably
      peaked the moment you first grazed it, and ‚Äì if you‚Äôre anything
      like me ‚Äì you could be harboring more aesthetic frustration with
      their longstanding occupation than you think. Infatuation must be
      starved to survive, and we‚Äôve been eating up Apples by the bushel
      for a decade.
    </para>

      I saw images in that Spectre review which I was completely
      satisfied with. I watched that new HP logo as it traveled through
      the frames, stupefied. Out of precious ignorance, I experienced
      real desire in that undesirable place. (Which could actually
      represent some sort of defeat on my part, but I‚Äôm not too
      bothered.)

      And in the midst of those desolate people in their fortress of
      mediocrity, my mom and I hatched a plan to indulge upon the best
      part of desolation ‚Äì impulsive, subsidized gluttony. We‚Äôd stop by
      the pharmacy to fill my anti-depressant script before renavigating
      Bourgeois Bumper Cars to get to Best Buy, where she‚Äôd let me use
      her credit line to purchase my final choice in the segment.

      emulating the first generation of tech-reviewing YouTubers ‚Äì but
      now, it reminds me of a darkwood restaurant with its closing
      fluorescents on, shining in the inverse frequency of a bug zapper
      ‚Äì casting a more effectively-repelling ambiance for the human
      psyche than anything else <emphasis>I‚Äôm</emphasis> capable of

      I used to fucking <emphasis>visit</emphasis> that store for no

      a handful of occasions.

      But these days, I am perturbed from the onset in a big way. There
      are too many blue vape enthusiasts on the sales floor at any given
      time, and they all want me to leave. They loaf around the carcass
      of consumer technology‚Äôs passion, not realizing, I guess, that I
      already know it ‚Äôtwas they who killed it. (The stench is strongest
      by the wearables.) It‚Äôs eerie how little the Big Box itself has
      changed, considering the decade their goods have traveled.

      Under a fittingly-gray sky, I wash my pill down with La Croix and
      a Kind bar to preempt the appropriate rumination in my mouth as we
      inch toward my Final Financial Doom with the spooked sliders.
      Though we never exceed 5mph, there are abandoned vehicles
      littering the shoulders and medians in varyingly absurd
      orientations. But I do not jest ‚Äì today, I am silent, for I am one
      of them.

      By the time we reach the store, my medicine has once again placed
      my soul in Safe Mode, so we shuffle into the grotesque thing.
      There are four employees in sight ‚Äì no one else ‚Äì and they all
      send their beady eyes my way. I have too much purpose in my
      consumerist jowls to pause, though, so I rush to the laptops near
      the opposite wall in an attempt to get an early estimate on my
      current level of personal computing idiocy. Naturally, my Mom
      snags one of another four associates immediately. In this work, I
      shall refer to him as Zoroaster.

      Despite having never seen 80% of the displayed devices in person
      before, I am able to spot the Spectres quickly, which is a good
      sign. I am immediately elated by the contrast to the depressing
      mushbooks I remember HP making in the oughts. The bezel‚Ä¶ the
      brilliance of the display‚Ä¶ the details of the visible body. I open
      <emphasis>Extratone</emphasis>. I open <emphasis>The
      Verge</emphasis>. I am hoping that Windows 10 will not be as much
      of a kicker as I‚Äôve expected.

    <para>
      I‚Äôm not a minute before Mom and Zoroaster have found the new
      MacBook Pros. Nobody remembers the password to the 13-inch, but
      the 15 is showing off its ‚Äúdeep blacks‚Äù and ‚ÄúSpace Gray‚Äù mood. The
      Verge looks phenomenal, and its icon in the touchbar catches my
      eye. I manage to use it to switch tabs, the less-attuned
      degenerate in me noting the extra spanning required over CMD-TAB.

      ‚ÄúHave you tried the new keyboard?‚Äù asks Zoroaster.

      I hadn‚Äôt. It‚Äôs as indescribable as you‚Äôve heard, but suggests

      It‚Äôs not as if the thing isn‚Äôt gorgeous, though, in its way. After

      But it is also bleak and slateish. Some might even say
      <emphasis>dystopian</emphasis>. Do I want to carry such a thing
      around with me everywhere? Do I even want to carry it

      Let me be honest with you ‚Äì I spent some ninety minutes going

      of the <emphasis>challenge</emphasis> the Spectre presents to it
      is no small milestone.

      As Zoroaster scrambles to remove my new machine from <emphasis>The
      Hanging Jail</emphasis>, I am drained from the decision, but aware
      that my perspective on the world has changed. I‚Äôve been working on
      an editorial for the past few weeks that‚Äôs mostly alarmed howling
      about the industry‚Äôs utter lack of passion, as of late, but seeing
      the Windows-running department‚Äôs devices and their matured design
      ‚Äì <emphasis>finally</emphasis> beautiful without obvious Apple
      influence ‚Äì had truly revived some little flame of hope within me.

      Lithe Zoroaster was confused by UPCs a bit, as is understandable,
      and began juggling three Spectre boxes atop the prison lift,

      bewildered disciple, below.

      Throughout the later half of the whole ordeal, I‚Äôd had company ‚Äì
      some sort of blonde working man who‚Äôd also braved the frictionless
      waste to calm himself with debt. I‚Äôd been elated at the
      opportunity for companionship, at first, but he‚Äôd found himself
      unable to escape the store‚Äôs bespoke Apple Hole. I did my best to
      help him, but failed hoist his girth from the 15‚Äôs benchmark
      suction. I‚Äôd left him there, bound. May my dreams n‚Äôer be haunted
      by the fading portrait of his tortured, middle class face.

      As the Best Boys did their dance, he somberly came to my side. The

      he appeared on in February, last night, and also found

      from 2013, when he was still EiC of <emphasis>The

      the idealism I've risked most of myself for, in case you're

      He has done ‚Äì and is doing ‚Äì many things which I am intrinsically

      to say that I've learned more in the past 10 months from a fucking
      WordPress website than I would've if I'd spent that time at the
      Journalism school. The first annual renewal payment for extratone
      dot com just went through, actually. A year ago, I was

      directionless. I honestly can't tell if I feel any better

      <emphasis>wherever the fuck this dialect comes from.</emphasis> I
      think it's almost certainly more efficient as an informative
      device than my piece, or

      disinterested as to hesitate to even commit to <emphasis>complete
      sentences</emphasis> regarding something
      <emphasis>actually</emphasis> newsworthy for a technology
      publication should be taken personally.
    </para>

      <emphasis role="strong">I believe there is an audience that is
      craving attention to detail in their stories, a more intimate,
      longer-lasting, and more invested relationship with a much smaller

    <para>
      Even a sense of involvement in the process. It's probably a direct
      result of my longtime consumption of car magazines ‚Äì most of which
      still have sizable sections dedicated to direct, public
      correspondence with readers. It's also cross-platform to a surreal
      degree. Auto journalists of all tiers will straight up engage with
      you on Twitter. (<emphasis>MotorTrend</emphasis> literally prints
      YouTube comments.)
    </para>
    <para>
      Sure, the readership is old, and the topic is an outlier (it's
      fairly common knowledge that 'car people' are waaaay more
      vulnerable to obsession than other special interest communities,)
      but the species is more or less the same, and the results are
      plain as day, any time you care to look. In recently returning my
      attention to technology journalism, I've noticed an irritating
      affront to meta conversation with strangers. My theory is that
      they've been paid for their words so long that they develop a very
      particular greed towards them, which is why academic journalism
      institutes are immediately shunned by their alumni after
      graduation until they are definitely Too Tired to sling copy and
      begin to climb sortof diagonally through editorial titles until
      they are stashed away in some hole. Then, after ruminating until
      their first encounter with Actual Death ‚Äì if they're still
      interested in the whole thing ‚Äì they crawl out to be propped up in
      front of moderately sized bodies of petrified students to scream
      in 100% bitterness about <emphasis>The Ethics</emphasis> that
      plagued them spiritually and financially their entire career at
      the acolytes as their last joke on the world.
    </para>
    <para>
      But they won't engage with strangers on Twitter.
    </para>
    <para>
      As someone who ‚Äì for better or worse ‚Äì chose to sidestep the
      academic route, I will never advocate for any value in withholding
      information ‚Äì especially funny stories ‚Äì about
      <emphasis>Extratone</emphasis>'s operation. If anything,
      <emphasis>rediscovering relevance</emphasis> is a wholly meta
      pillar of our editorial bent. (Hence, why Tim calls us

    <para>
      I also believe the subscriber &amp; advertising revenue models are
      <emphasis>directly</emphasis> - if not
      <emphasis>primarily</emphasis> - involved in the constriction of
      conversations regarding a publication's operation. It's my goal to
      cultivate a group of subscribers that are directly invested in the

    <title>Eugen Rochko has spent this year perfecting federated social
    media in Mastodon ‚Äì his open source project. We spoke to him just
    hours before it became a global tech conversation.</title>
    <para>
      The saga of Twitter, Inc. has been rejuvenated in 2017 by Tump's
      antics, corporate drama, and an amalgam of user and non-user
      disquiet with its decisions, though its financial viability has
      been in prominent industry conversation for half a decade. Since
      its pre-2010 outset, many 'a' feature has accumulated on its
      original, still-iconic skeletal software, and ‚Äì though the net is
      undoubtedly positive ‚Äì a few have gone.
    </para>
    <para>
      Last Thursday, the company revised in bravado its poultrian
      default profile picture and its system of replies to exclude @s on
      all of Twitter's proprietary services, drastically changing two of
      its visual mainstays, and prodding a particularly lucent
      cacophony. Turn your ear, and you'll hear many familiar terms in
      the chants: <emphasis>limits, chains, strings, harassment,
      feedback, gamergate, nazis, etc.</emphasis>
    </para>
    <para>
      These conversations are important, but they've gotten awfully
      stale.

      If you listen a bit more carefully, you'll intercept a new one:

      Between the night of our first emails and our conversation, his
      flagship
      <link xlink:href="http://mastodon.social/">mastadon.social</link>
      instance had doubled in users. Less than two hours after we said
      our goodbyes, his name was on <emphasis>The Verge</emphasis>'s
      front page.
    </para>
    <para>
      Despite the urgency of it all, he graciously lent me his time just
      after breakfast on Tuesday to discuss himself and the story behind
      the project, while the most significant day of his life was
      building around him.

    <para>
      Many years ago, I had a friend that was really into federated
      networks when they were a new thing. That was when
      <link xlink:href="http://identi.ca/">identi.ca</link> was first
      created ‚Äì at the very beginning of my developer knowledge and
      career.
    </para>
    <para>
      A good portion of the stories written so far on his platform have
      framed it as an alternative to Twitter, which early Masto adopters
      refer to as ‚ÄúHellbird,‚Äù or ‚Äúthe bird website.‚Äù Eugen isn't afraid
      to acknowledge his investment in the format.
    </para>
    <para>
      I was a heavy Twitter user and I wasn't happy with where Twitter
      was going, so I decided to check on how the federated stuff was
      doing in the meantime. I found it in a very sad state, but thought
      I could contribute.
    </para>
    <para>
      He began building on his own, with Tweetdeck's standard in mind.
    </para>
    <blockquote>
      <para>
        I thought 'if I'm going to do something, it needs to have
        realtime updates and it needs to have columns.' I started with a
        bare-bones prototype while still [at University] in May or April
        of last year. It had no user interface, only an API that I was
        using from the command line. And I thought 'okay, it works.
        that's great.' Then, exams came.
      </para>
    </blockquote>
    <para>
      Academics had to come before the project at first, but it soon
      supplied an ample post-graduation diversion. He focused his energy
      on building something more complete and eventually launched a
      <link xlink:href="https://www.patreon.com/user?u=619786">Patreon

    </para>
    <blockquote>
      <para>
        I
        <link xlink:href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=13303346">announced</link>
        it on HackerNews, and that was the first public release of the
        project. That's when I got my first users who weren't my
        friends, and some who were new to federated networks.
      </para>
    </blockquote>
    <para>
      That was just over 100 days ago, and it gave way to his first
      feedback.
    </para>
    <blockquote>
      <para>
        I started working on the first feature requests, shaping the
        project a bit differently. People were a lot more focused on
        privacy features than I thought they would be, although in
        retrospect, it makes sense. The previous [federated] project ‚Äì
        GNU social ‚Äì did not really have a focus on privacy features, or
        anything built in by default.
      </para>
    </blockquote>
    <para>
      It compelled him to change things, and his work was well received.
    </para>
    <blockquote>
      <para>
        Over time, I kept working on new features, and waves of new
        users came when it went viral in certain circles. The first was
        HackerNews and Product Hunt.
        <link xlink:href="https://twitter.com/aral">Aral Balkan</link> ‚Äì
        a Twitter user with over 30,000 followers ‚Äì picked up the
        project, gave it a shout out, and even did a giveaway of his
        app. He had a lot of followers from Holland; the Mastodon
        timelines became mostly Dutch.

      Next was Marxist anime Twitter (including

    </para>
    <para>
      Lots of furries; lots of LGBT people. That's when I really focused
      on privacy features and making sure all blocks worked because

      margin, but there are [additional] people who've contributed
      interesting, good features &amp; fixes, localizations, user
      guides, and documentation.

      <emphasis role="strong">What's the story behind the

    <para>
      It's not particularly interesting. I'm a progressive metal fan,
      and I listen to <emphasis>Mastodon</emphasis> sometimes. They have
      a really cool name that refers to a really cool animal. It's a
      fluffy elephant! What's not to love?
    </para>
    <para>
      It's also the inspiration for Mastodon's mascot, which was penned
      by Rochko's YouTuber friend
      <link xlink:href="https://www.youtube.com/user/dopatwo">Dopatwo</link>
      after he realized how urgently he required an error page.

    <para>
      <emphasis role="strong">What does ‚Äúfederated‚Äù mean to
      you?</emphasis>
    </para>
    <para>
      The biggest problem with this term is that it's new for lots of
      people. People who've come across federated networks in the
      past<emphasis>instantly</emphasis> understand what it means and
      how it works, and people who are new to the concept have a lot of
      trouble before it clicks. But when Twitter first started, people
      didn't understand what 'retweeting' meant, so it's not a unique
      problem domain.
    </para>
    <para>
      I don't know where it comes from ‚Äì maybe BitTorrent ‚Äì but people
      seem to think that when something is 'decentralized,' everybody
      gets the same thing; that it's all synchronized one to one. In
      actuality, 'federated' means that people in different instances
      can <emphasis>talk</emphasis> to each other, but the
      <emphasis>content</emphasis> is different depending on the users
      there, what they do, and who they follow.
    </para>
    <para>
      Though instances are infrastructurally independent, they can
      communicate with one another. On a user level, timelines are still
      determined by who you do and do not follow across the entirety of
      all instances.
    </para>
    <para>
      <emphasis role="strong">What if Twitter comes to you in the near
      future with a job offer?</emphasis>
    </para>
    <para>
      [Rochko laughs.]
    </para>
    <para>
      If it was any other company, I would think about it. A job is a
      staple source of income, and ‚Äì depending on the company ‚Äì could
      involve doing something important, but I have zero faith in
      Twitter.

      <emphasis role="strong">Does this all mean that I finally get to
      live out my serif Twitter dream?</emphasis>

      Yes, I suppose on your own instance, you could change the
      stylesheet...

    <para>
      Yes, that's okay. The code is licensed under
      <link xlink:href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.html">AGPL</link>
      version three, which I picked because other projects in the same
      space are using it. The difference between AGPL and GPL is that
      [the former] forces you to contribute back to the appstream code
      repository if you make any breaking changes.
    </para>
    <para>
      For example, Eugen explained that WhatsApp originally used XMPP
      for its chat protocol, which meant that Facebook and Google Talk
      users could connect to it, too. However, the company progressively
      locked down the platform over time, leaving virtually nothing
      visible that was unique to XMPP in its current iteration.

      To prevent somebody taking Mastodon code, placing it behind locks,
      and stripping out the federation part to make Twitter II, I'm
      using this license.

    <para>
      The thing to remember about free software is that 'free' means
      <emphasis>freedom of the user,</emphasis> not that it's zero cost.
      It's perfectly fine to charge for free software because developers
      need to live, too.
    </para>
    <para>
      <emphasis role="strong">I've seen a lot of multilingual 'tooting'
      these past few weeks. Can we expect an in-app translate function
      like Twitter's on Mastodon?</emphasis>
    </para>
    <para>
      I don't think I could put in a 'translate this toot' button
      because APIs from Google and Bing are quite expensive at scale.
      I'm not 100% promising this, but I can probably put something in
      where people can select which language they post in, and then just
      filter the timelines. That would at least solve the problem of
      being confronted with lots of French posts, without knowing any
      French.
    </para>
    <para>
      <emphasis role="strong">The only complaint about Twitter I

      of editable 'toots.' Is that a possibility?</emphasis>
    </para>
    <para>
      That won't happen. There's actually a good reason why they don't
      do that. It's simply because you could make a toot about one
      thing, have people favorite it and share it, link it from other
      places, and then suddenly, it says 'Heil Hitler,' or something.

      It's a bit preposterous to continue the conversation as if Twitter
      and Mastodon are interchangeable entities. They exist in separate
      ideological and mechanical spheres, and will both continue to do
      so for a very long time.
    </para>
    <para>
      That said, the fundamental user interface design and current
      cross-community user saturation <emphasis>do</emphasis> warrant
      comparisons between their functions. More likely than not, you'll
      create a Mastodon account because a link found you on Twitter, use
      it because you prefer its type of ecosystem, and you'll stay after
      realizing that nearly all of your age-old qualms have been
      addressed, if not already rectified. While
      <emphasis>FOSS</emphasis> and <emphasis>Federated</emphasis> may
      seem at times like jejune ideologies, their advantages are
      especially tangible in this context. Should you find yourself
      needing to complain about something, you'll find an audience.
      Perhaps it'll be your command line.

    <para>
      It's nothing but negligent to describe Mastodon as an

      It's more like Twitter's son.
    </para>
    <para>
      It's leaner, quicker-to-change, much more flexible &amp;
      democratized, and less corrupt. Though I didn't ask its creator
      what he intended to gain from all his effort, I think his
      commitment itself denotes a preoccupation with progress. Those of
      you who've been let down by the tools you've been given to control
      your words' exposure will find startling competence in your
      ability to determine per-toot privacy, or reserve your raucous
      photos and terrible memes from followers who are not necessarily
      complicit consumers. Naturally, it's also much less dependable,
      though a single instance outage will never leave you truly,
      completely silent. And the support will come.

      Today, after positing on whether or not a pastry was in fact the
      namesake of the battleship <emphasis>Bismarck</emphasis>, I was
      told by its owner ‚Äì a local woman of a far-from-excusable age ‚Äì
      that ‚Äú[I] should be on that big bang show.‚Äù Upon such fuckery, I
      looked her in her eyes and informed her that she'd just changed my
      plans for the night: I was now going to go home, wrap my lips
      around the barrel of my Beretta, and blow my brains out. I
      should've known better than to so jest with a boomer immediately
      after receiving such glaring indicators of minimal intellectual
      function, but I fell for the hope ‚Äì as I often do, to no avail ‚Äì
      that such a jarring reaction would encourage reflection on her
      foul, tragically misled sentiments regarding the general state of
      youth, and perhaps even spare a peer or two from future
      tribulation.
    </para>
    <para>
      Instead, she called the police.
    </para>
    <para>
      Three round cops found me, an hour later, approaching hesitantly.
      Strangely enough, they were chuckling ‚Äì maybe to a little joke
      about all the recent hubbub on the radio covering a recent wave of
      blatantly negligent medical care in American prisons, though I
      hope nervous laughter is just <emphasis>SOP</emphasis> when
      responding to a suicide threat. As all Columbia cops always are
      toward me, they were aggravatingly genuine and hilariously
      understanding. I began by simply recreating my interaction with
      their summoner, quoting her word-for-word, and ‚Äì I swear to my new
      Lord ‚Äì all three immediately released a choral ‚Äúohhhhh‚Äù in unison.
      I'll never know for sure if they actually assimilated the reality
      of the situation so quickly, but it'd certainly seem that way.
    </para>
    <para>
      Clearly, I should've threatened <emphasis>her</emphasis> life.
    </para>
    <para>
      Despite the day-to-day expression of our recurring wisdoms,
      habits, instincts, patterns and cycles of cultural metamorphosis
      in the discourse, the stream of ‚Äúwell, you know they were sayin'
      the world was going to end when <emphasis>I</emphasis> was in
      elementary school‚Äù to my ear has fallen abruptly silent since the
      inauguration. Our parents and grandparents are both impossibly
      fortunate and unfortunate, having to duck out as the most
      multiplicative (read: sickest) cerebral orgy in the history of
      mankind will just've begun nibbling on the slope to its climax.
      We'll be lucky if we'll still be able to articulate our goodbyes
      by the time they reach the door. Nonsense does a fuckin number on
      perceived wisdom, but the gaps <emphasis>are</emphasis> widening
      at a dangerous pace. Tectonic or domestic, we are all straddling
      expanding space, and the chill of its draft is now stealing too
      much of our heat to ignore.
    </para>
    <para>
      Though it is entertaining in the moment (and otherwise redundant,)
      it would not be <emphasis>well-to-do</emphasis> of me now ‚Äì nor
      was it, then ‚Äì to leave the conversation in edgy absurdity. Yes, a
      part of me would like to campaign for <emphasis>Sheldon</emphasis>
      to be reclassified as an expletive, in disgust, but ‚Äì as an adult
      in all-out sprint to make up for stalled emotional development ‚Äì I
      must note that such a display of concern should've been at least
      reciprocated with a bit of explanation, if not appreciation.
      Still, there are much more appropriate reasons and situations in
      which to waste public servants' time.
    </para>
    <para>
      It's not news ‚Äì the <emphasis>Theory</emphasis> is providing
      <emphasis>some</emphasis> ghoulishly skewed portrayal of
      less-than-forty pseudointellectuals. Obviously, my savior's time
      was worth very little to her, but the fact that she spent any
      quantity of anything at all engaging with even a decidedly
      mainstream generationally ambassadorial bridge could be regarded ‚Äì
      if stretched ‚Äì as the result of a curious seed, which has
      skyrocketed in human value, as of late. It is undiscouragable.
      Read the trail a bit, and you'll find that your frustration is
      simply an expression of the terror that's ignited by the stagnancy
      of their pace.

      No, I'm not capable of citing research or conjuring Mars-capable

      <link xlink:href="http://bit.ly/unescoliteracy">10% adult
      illiteracy rate</link>. It's all well and good to be privy to
      romanticism, but it's not the 1960s anymore. Even Howard Hughes

      continued reach for the stars, were he still alive.

      We spent the 1990s preparing to rid ourselves of history because
      the smartest among us foresaw some facsimile of the renaissance we
      are currently experiencing. If they'd been shown a glimpse of
      <link xlink:href="http://bit.ly/measuringconsumerinfo">some
      statistics</link> on the volume of media we consume, they'd
      exclaim of their pride ‚Äì no doubt ‚Äì in their species' capability
      to progress, and perhaps even their own contribution to it.
      However, extended observation of an average American's day-to-day
      life would be lamented, in disgust, and a

      Of course, it's unlikely that Mark's essence was bred entirely of

      There's a central mechanic of our brains that by nature wreaks a

      you may have heard it described as ‚Äúthe lizard brain.‚Äù Simply put,
      it's the brain stem, and it's responsible for the most basal and
      primitively emotional instincts and habits; an anti-intellectual
      agitant, arguing at all times for the course of action with the
      most immediate gratification. <emphasis>The Great Clickbait
      War</emphasis> of 2013 was a startling demonstration that revealed

      Mr. Fuck achieved his vision and became perhaps the greatest

      aviation became deeply ingrained into my identity, but my local
      community is <emphasis>very</emphasis> sparse ‚Äì it's not exactly
      <emphasis>cool</emphasis>, these days. On Fuckbook, an unofficial
      group for members of the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association
      has allowed me to stay connected to the rest of the world's

      In my youth, Lindbergh filled my closest equivalent to the

      In all likelihood, you have heard of Electronic Mail, but I‚Äôve

      Earlier this year, Tim and I had the opportunity to try virtual
      reality at the True/False Film Festival in a dark, curtained side
      room of a commandeered Columbia art gallery, but we were both much
      too intoxicated and loopy those last few hours of the fest, and we
      bailed. Call us cowards if you
      must‚Ää‚Äî‚Ää<emphasis>immersion</emphasis> can be a scary concept to
      those of us who grew up reading science fiction, before the
      existence of the modern video game console. I‚Äôve wanted just 30
      seconds or so with a pair of goggles, just to have an idea of what
      the increasing number of Oculus-blinded pedestrians surrounding me
      are looking at. Thanks to Isiah, I was finally caught up last
      night with a few VR YouTube videos and
      <emphasis>Farpoint</emphasis>‚Äôs introduction on a PlayStation 4.
    </para>
    <para>
      First, Isiah brings me the headset and describes in detail how
      exactly to adjust it, but I forget it all and simply try to shove
      it directly and violently on my face. Eventually, he takes it back
      and simply mounts and adjusts it around my monstrous skull‚Ää‚Äî‚Äälike
      you would for a toddler‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääand I lay eyes on the console for the
      first time. For whatever reason, it never occurred to me that
      general GUI wouldn‚Äôt simply be displayed in 2D, but by a literal
      <emphasis>virtual display</emphasis>, layed out in front of me
      like a large, floor-mounted touch workstation. I‚Äôm astonished by
      my ability to turn away from it to look at the rest of
      <emphasis>Goggleworld</emphasis>, which is nothing but a deeply
      black void.
    </para>
    <para>
      From my previous world, I hear Isiah and Hawthorn discussing what
      to show me first, and YouTube is the settled-upon environment. As
      the application is restarted in ‚ÄúVR Mode,‚Äù its startup screen is
      what <emphasis>really</emphasis> establishes the truth‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäI have
      <emphasis>gone virtual</emphasis>. I cannot use my hands to shield
      my eyes from the branding‚Äôs glaring watermark and terrifying red
      light. At its home menu, Isiah simply selects the ‚ÄúVR‚Äù tab,
      revealing a selection of thumbnails for
      algorithmically-recommended VR-shot videos on the service.
    </para>
    <para>
      To begin, I am mounted on the tail of a superbike as it‚Äôs raced
      around an American desert circuit. It takes a few seconds for high
      resolution to buffer, leaving me briefly in a pixelized hell that
      would surely make anyone sick, were they exposed very long. (I was
      especially excited to become nauseous, to no avail.) At the getgo,
      I am occupied with the rider‚Äôs butt since it‚Äôs center-frame if I
      stand in my usual posture. Isiah points out the hovering HUD to my
      left containing a selection of simulated digital instruments
      (tachometer, 7-segment speedo, etc.) Its presence would suggest
      that the purpose of my virtual passengership is to witness the lap
      as a motorsport enthusiast, but the rear of the rider obscures
      most of my view forward‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäI cannot admire his line as one would
      viewing a GoPro-or-otherwise POV of the same event, so I decide to
      try and figure out which track I am hurried through. Though the
      vehicle is tossed about in the required movements of motorbike
      operation, I myself (the VR capture device) am impressively
      gyrostabilized, and the image, static, as if I‚Äôm
      <emphasis>actually</emphasis> hovering above the pair as they
      moved along. I spin left and right, spotting a small gaggle of
      miniature wind turbines and two wilting hilltop trees in the
      foreground. Behind them, small sand dunes fill the space, all the
      way to the horizon.
    </para>
    <para>
      After a few minutes, I am finally relieved early of my cutless lap
      for a short <emphasis>National Geographic</emphasis> documentary
      on a Viking revival festival in Poland. I‚Äôm introduced to its Big
      Boys by a series of aerial shots (presumably by drone, which is
      awfully un-Vikinglike) as they row their Big Boat up(?) a
      relatively wide, tree-lined river. In contrast with the lap, the
      jump cuts become a bit disorienting‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäI am eventually jumped
      <emphasis>in</emphasis> the boat for a moment, next to the sweaty,
      bearded lads‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääa few of whom are shirtless. I notice a blurry
      church on the distant bank. Suddenly, I float briskly across the
      small no man‚Äôs land between two rapidly advancing battle lines of
      Nordic Nerds with real, era-specific weapons and way too much free
      time. More lingering drone shots follow from just a few feet above
      the ensuing conflict. Outside, Isiah confirms Hawthorn‚Äôs
      suggestion that this is, indeed, <emphasis>the one where they use
      real weapons</emphasis> as I notice a pile of three or four men
      lying against each other, motionless on the ground,
      right-of-center in the nearest line, and mull over the sure
      disturbance of all this immersion the festival has allowed in
      welcoming the presence of the surely-buzzing drone. <emphasis>I
      guess they‚Äôre dead</emphasis>.
    </para>
    <para>
      After the conflict, I am subjected to a dreamier, narrated montage
      accompanied by cheesy synthesized orchestral music and featuring
      disproportionately a particular man with a shiny, tatted bald head
      and rather large feet with rather small toes, which he likes to
      wiggle during these particular conversations. Thanks to VR‚Äôs
      omniencompassing perspective, I am allowed to observe his wiggling
      in his every appearance. The tone of the background music and the
      prevalence of relaxed, conversing couples and sunsets in the
      scenes suggest romanticism is the montage‚Äôs theme, but for me, it
      is the bald man‚Äôs feet‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäI am too busy conversing with my two
      friends, across the divide, in this world, to listen to any of
      what is said. Considering that YouTube collects the dimensional
      data regarding where the user looks, and for how long, I make an
      effort to bend my neck up and down in extremes, and notice a patch
      of washed-out sky, distorting in the distance, and ponder
      what‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääif anything‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääwe have gained in this technology.

      Does an increase in the raw amount of visual data available to the
      viewer actually make motion picture storytelling more effective?
      In the few minutes of my VR taste test, I <emphasis>did</emphasis>
      gain quite a bit of volition over an equivalent 2D experience, but
      it didn‚Äôt seem like I‚Äôd instinctively used it to gain much else.
      If one is specifically interested in the shrubbery around a
      racetrack, or the more nuanced undulations of a Viking‚Äôs foot,
      they can more likely than not find a standard video on the World
      Wide Web that would more efficiently entertain them. In specific
      situations, of course, a producer can undoubtedly benefit by the
      ability to capture in 360 degrees, but‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääin any sort of cinema,
      especially‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääit seems unnecessarily sacrificial to relinquish
      entirely the narrative directorial control of shot framing to
      their audience. However, I am the anti-expert on this subject,
      obviously. My take on the viability of VR is Virtually Redundant
      and‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääquite possibly‚Ää‚Äî‚Äävery wrong, but my time in its hell is not
      over yet.
    </para>
    <para>
      Isiah explains that it is time for me to
      <emphasis>game</emphasis>, and asks if I‚Äôd like to try ‚Äúthe one
      with <emphasis role="strong">the hands</emphasis>, or the one with
      <emphasis role="strong">the gun</emphasis>.‚Äù As always, I choose
      the firearm, as the ‚Äúhands‚Äù have not been found yet and the
      hypothetical image immediately offered up by my imagination is of
      rusty iron shackles. The Infinite Blackness has returned, and I
      cannot see beyond it to determine what my host is up to. Then, it
      becomes outer space‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääfilling with thousands of star-like white
      dots. The light-blue outline of a virtual PlayStation controller
      appears where I assume him to be, unattached and bumbling about.
      Soon, it jaggedly approaches, and I feel him hand it to me. We
      have started its calibration process, which becomes a bit
      frightening in my celestial surroundings, though at least I have
      now gained participatory power over my new existence. I‚Äôd opted
      out of wearing headphones, so the assistant‚Äôs malignant-sounding
      female British voice comes softly from the television somewhere in
      front of me as I point the beam of light the controller‚Äôs
      representation is now projecting straight forward at the
      navigational arrows displayed ahead and pull ‚Äúthe trigger‚Äù (R2.)
    </para>
    <para>
      I am pleased by the idea of interfacing with software exclusively
      by shooting it repeatedly before I am abruptly contained in a
      cage, now being projected by a virtualization of the system‚Äôs
      sensor, which is unsettling. I am now calibrating the hardware
      contained within the physical device that captures the position of
      my body in the physical world. I catch the word ‚Äúconfinement‚Äù in
      the assistant‚Äôs unending, otherwise-inaudible directions, and
      quicken my pace. When it‚Äôs all done, I return the controller to
      Isiah, who reboots the PS4, itself, before launching
      <emphasis>Farpoint</emphasis>. My space becomes a lighter blue and
      fills with little opaque bits of Sony Dust for a minute or two.
      Isiah continues his rummaging for another peripheral as the
      title‚Äôs introduction begins to play.
    </para>
    <para>
      Two rather poorly-animated astronauts are co-hosting a live
      broadcast from their craft, which is presented in a dramatization
      of a computer display. They‚Äôve just met, but they‚Äôre both stacked
      with academia, co-massaging their knowledge, which I choose not to
      listen to. Out of view, Isiah unsuccessfully attempts to skip the
      whole thing before I‚Äôm allowed to become
      <emphasis>virtual</emphasis> again‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääthis time, atop the animated
      body of another astronaut in a lone shuttle, approaching the
      mothership where it holds, next to a large, very-<emphasis>Star
      Trek</emphasis> ‚Äúanomaly.‚Äù From Deep Space Nine, the two
      scientists continue to bicker over comms as I look around the
      cockpit. Looking backwards has already become a favorite habit of
      mine‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäI wonder where the shuttle‚Äôs bathroom is. For whatever
      reason, the back of my character‚Äôs neck was animated, though it
      can only be seen by looking rearwards and down, which distorts its
      shape into something truly terrifying.
    </para>
    <para>
      A bunch of unrelated plot follows, leading me to end up on a
      foreign world, exiting my crashed escape pod. By now, Isiah has
      connected <emphasis>The Gun</emphasis>, but something about it
      isn‚Äôt quite right‚Ää‚Äî‚Äämy character holds it in a glitched, very
      uncomfortable-looking manner, and it‚Äôs suspected that a fix would
      require a restart, and therefore‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääa replay of the introductory
      cutscene‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääso I retire out of lack of patience.
    </para>

      before Tump, and any critical resolution the film provides is
      argued haphazardly. Consequently, its eye is cast on this strange,
      satirical portrayal of the Midwest in a manner which is inaccurate
      and insensitive enough to irk this Missourian. When I saw it at
      Columbia‚Äôs Ragtag Cinema this week, it was introduced by a young
      employee who noted that 1) Ebbing, Missouri is not a real place,
      2) the film was actually shot in one of the Carolinas (an audience
      member suggested incorrectly that it was in SC,) and 3) we should
      prepare ourselves to be roused a bit by a bar scene in which a
      character pays $8 for two beers because ‚Äúthat just wouldn‚Äôt
      happen‚Äù (the Ragtag also serves alcohol.)

      Growing up astride classe while traveling throughout the vast

      Racist cops, abusive spouses, unsolved murders, and mishandled

      the ‚Äúnumber one‚Äù movie he‚Äôs made in the past ten years
      (disqualifying <emphasis>National Treasure</emphasis>, in case you

      wonderfully raucous and feral thing, but the scene involving the
      attempted murder of a newborn by her mother (Kendall‚Äôs sister)
      came very close to crossing the line. However, I am old and the
      intensity of my paternal instincts has probably outpaced my
      understanding of them. You could also argue, of course, that

      class, and racism ‚Äî truly, this is a film charged electrically
      with current issues. Or maybe not. Ultimately, I can at least tell
      you for certain that Brian Taylor made exponentially better use of
      his resources (I couldn‚Äôt find a solid number for its production
      budget) than the Fucking Spierig Brothers did with
      <emphasis>Winchester</emphasis> (just so you know what a disaster
      looks like,) and managed to be refreshingly original (astonishing

      the things in life that give mine meaning: bicycles, beanies, body
      art, brewing, electric guitars, and the hair that grows on my
      face. Every day, I am more and more afraid that my voice will be
      lost in them, and if it is lost, I am afraid there will be nothing
      left of Me or my meaning. This thought worries me like none other,
      and ‚Äî as long as people like me have sufficient economic and
      social resources to do so ‚Äî we should make for ourselves an Island

    believes it should assume control.</title>

      Out of all the technology companies that have made my knees knock
      and my voice hoarse and my
      <link xlink:href="http://bit.ly/bluegoogle">Tweets manic</link> as
      a technoheretic in the past several years, Jumbo Google would
      easily take home the winning trophy for Dystopian of the
      Millennium. I have been rehearsing an especially dear pet prophecy
      of mine, unsolicited, to family, friends, and podcast guests since
      2011 in which I end up arguing quite convincingly that Google is a
      dead ringer for the 16th-century Vatican: an inherently
      self-isolating organization with an absolute monopoly yielding
      <emphasis>gargantuan</emphasis> levels of essentially passive
      income from a service which nearly everybody transacts with, but
      only Google understands (and is therefore assumed to be its only
      possible provider,) which inevitably develops such a distance from
      the rest of the populace and their way of life (in tandem with
      total notoriety and celebrity among them all) not intentionally
      out of malice, but from the delusion of mythically-bestowed
      philanthropic duty that is borned of and compounded by this
      economic and cultural isolation in a perpetual accumulation of
      power and wealth that radicalizes the monopolizers ‚Äî the majority
      already highly predisposed to zeal as they would‚Äôve needed to be
      in order to find themselves in this singular, universally powerful
      position over every other class ‚Äî and leaves their egocentric
      minds to wander exempt from all criticism save for that of fellow
      radicalized monopolizers, who together begin to feel more and more
      comfortable wondering aloud about themselves in increasingly
      fantastic presumptions: <emphasis>what if all of this was bestowed
      upon us because we are superior to them? What if it is
      our</emphasis> <emphasis role="strong">divine
      responsibility</emphasis> <emphasis>as superior beings to take

      You see it, right? And you can feel a very specific flavor of
      terror that is both awed by the scale of the circumstances created
      by so few human minds and sincerely amused by the absoluteness of
      your own inability to alter them in any way. Perhaps you even
      recognize this taste as one perfected by Christianity‚Äôs ancient
      advertising business, but Google knows so much about you that it‚Äôs
      rumored to‚Äôve been selling user data <emphasis>to</emphasis> the
      Judeochristian God for some time now at a 10% discount, and so we
      extrapolate and anticipate, yes?

      Of course, it‚Äôs admittedly satisfying for me to deliver you to

      personas and livelihoods of fringe movement fanatics are built
      upon, but this is my <emphasis>one</emphasis> thing, okay? I‚Äôve
      been waiting years for the right time to formally argue this
      theory in depth, and ‚Äî thanks to this year‚Äôs public spotlight
      finally pivoting on the giants who‚Äôve been silently swallowing
      their competition and relentlessly forcing their already
      ridiculous margins higher and higher in relative obscurity for
      decades, the time has come, indeed. The common people‚Äôs trust in

      The reality of internal disagreements at Google, though, manages

      Gmail development as 4000 employees no doubt vented, debated, and
      decided to organize last month, though without making much headway
      because the leadership‚Äôs response was apparently ‚Äúcomplicated by

      So, what would the internet look like if Google didn‚Äôt exist? We
      know they‚Äôve been working with the government now on various
      projects, but what if some terrible exposed transgression of
      theirs suddenly warranted an immediate shutdown and seizure of all
      Google properties? Well, we know from
      <link xlink:href="https://www.quora.com/What-would-happen-if-Google-were-to-shut-down-for-30-minutes">a
      post on Quora</link> by Googler Ashish Kedia that even 5 years
      ago, the sudden absence of Google for ‚Äú2‚Äì3 mins‚Äù set the internet
      into a bit of a panic, reducing overall traffic by 40%. In the
      time since, we‚Äôve all grown exponentially more dependent on Google
      properties: billions of people rely on Google Maps for directions
      and, thousands of companies (including the Pentagon and other
      government institutions) rely on Gmail and GSuites for
      intercommunication, file sharing, task management, etc., and more
      and more academic institutions rely on Chromebook devices running
      connection-dependent operating systems. It‚Äôs not much of a stretch
      to argue that Google‚Äôs sudden disappearance would constitute a
      Civil Emergency in the United States, which will only become a
      stronger and more serious incentive for regulatory bodies to look

      cannot possibly spend it fast enough, as evidenced by

      must surely be one of the most inefficient companies in history.
      Thinking back on recent software releases along with its

      worst competing tech companies. Very little aside from Gmail,
      Google Photos, Google Maps, and Chrome have found their place or
      garnered significant usership. Google Play Music is unintuitive
      and impossible, Google Allo and Google+ are all but forgotten
      addendums to other services, and Google Search ‚Äî its core,

      If this all has stirred nothing more in you than a desire to

      they‚Äôve long been too powerful to control. In the meantime, I‚Äôd
      suggest you continue to use whatever software works best for you
      and refrain from wasting your time fretting on conspiratorial
      suppositions of what the tech industry may be doing to ‚Äúinvade
      your privacy,‚Äù because there is no longer any such thing, nor will
      there be ever again. However, I would also urge to you worship
      your own Gods, whomever they may be, for Google will never be
      worthy. I, for one, shall only pray to our Mother Sun.

    <title>An autobiographical overview of my personal history with
    technology and its contributions to my current perspective.</title>
    <para>
      Incalculable odds were against my arrival in this world happening
      in early 1994, positioning my life within a timeline that would
      allow me to bridge my two species‚Äô most significant millenniums in
      the first grade as a student in the first class at Fairview
      Elementary school to receive curriculum-mandated exposure to
      brand-new Windows 98 PCs in its brand-new, fluorescent-lit
      computer lab in the center core of its 50-year-old rectangular
      brick structure. The lab also meant that ours was the first
      Fairview class to have the available relief of air conditioning
      during the school day. It‚Äôs unlikely that I would be home sick and
      watching the last television ever allowed in my mother‚Äôs living
      room as the second plane hit.
    </para>
    <para>
      My peers and I would form a picogeneration without a name (perhaps
      we should be called the 9/11ers)‚Ää‚Äî‚Ää91s and 92s wouldn‚Äôt have
      regular access to public school machines until they‚Äôd eclipsed the
      true prime of their development, and were just that much further
      along, mentally, to being able to comprehend the huge and
      terrifying concepts of 1) New York and 2) burning alive‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääwhile
      98s like my niece were spared any such comprehension of death at
      all, yet now have to face the existentially future-sundering,
      darkly-mirrored reality of the Trump Presidency during the most
      critically uncertain period in the last stage of their brain‚Äôs
      transition to adulthood.
    </para>
    <para>
      If there is truth in the cross-cultural supposition that souls
      have some sort of choice, pre-conception, over when they‚Äôre born,
      my own must have either cleaned out the house, or lost horrible,
      though I suspect I‚Äôll never be able to confidently wager either
      way. This question of <emphasis>how lucky or unlucky am I to be
      alive right now</emphasis> is one which I find most
      fascinating‚Ää‚Äî‚Äänot just within myself, but within others my age. I
      declare us a generation largely because of my experiences under
      the assumption that my mid-Missouri upbringing represents the
      ultimate average in the American experiences of the time as the
      area has been a reliable sample of the clearest average of the
      country‚Äôs cultural, political, and economic life. Technically, it
      was quite unlikely that I arrive here as a new human being instead
      of China or India, and what if that, too was my choice?
    </para>
    <para>
      Though less so, it was still against chance that I would be born
      to parents who would divorce very quickly after my birth, before
      my mind was able to form any tangible long-term memories, sparing
      me whatever pain could‚Äôve resulted from their greater togetherness
      later nullified in front of me. I could‚Äôve chosen them as well for
      the variety of experiences their situation would allow me as I
      grew up between my father‚Äôs 800-acre farm and my mother‚Äôs suburban
      house in Columbia, the college town an hour‚Äôs drive south. I write
      about my experiences now‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääso young‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääbecause I‚Äôve likely already
      born witness to more extraordinary changes in human development
      than your parents, their parents, and their parents‚Äô parents
      combined. At 24, my life has already spanned by far the most
      profound and expedited informational renaissance in human
      history‚Ää‚Äî‚Äägreater progress was made between the day I first rode a
      bicycle and the one on which I took my driver‚Äôs test than in
      thousands of years before it.

    <para>
      The sum of my father‚Äôs ordeals between 1950 and 1974‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääfrom his
      birth until the age I am now‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääwould indeed include watching a man
      set foot on a spatial body other than Earth for the first time,
      but would be mostly defined by work on the family‚Äôs soybean, corn,
      and wheat farms in central Illinois, driving carbureted tractors
      pulling cultivating equipment of the same basic design and
      function as had been pulled by horses, mules, and oxen for
      hundreds of years, and other implements‚Ää‚Äî‚Äälike the mechanical
      multi-row planter‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääthat were new technology at the beginning of
      the century. For neighbors, he would walk behind the path of a
      square hay baler next to a moving flatbed trailer, upon which he
      would throw the 70‚Äì100 lb. rectangles of dead compacted grass by
      their twine through thick cowhide gloves. All of this I would get
      to experience in the next century on <emphasis>his</emphasis>
      farm, using the exact same equipment.
    </para>
    <para>
      At home, he would watch NBC, ABC, and CBS on a CRT TV, as I would
      for several years until wireless television was legally
      transitioned to digital statewide in the summer of 2009. As an
      adolescent, he would form a business with friends cleaning out old
      abandoned barns in exchange for the rights of ownership to any
      finds inside, which led to his discovery of a hay-preserved 1929
      Buick Sedan containing hand-written records of its every service.
      This car would change hands into his Uncle‚Äôs care as he went off
      to school in Champaign, married in Georgia, and eventually settled
      on the flat clay soil of the farm where I grew up, right on the
      border between Audrain and Monroe counties, Missouri. I was about
      10 when we drove back to the family hub with a trailer in tow to
      collect the car from my Great Uncle, to my manic excitement.
    </para>
    <para>
      Up until my mid-teens, my life was defined by my extreme reverence
      for historic cars, airplanes, tractors, and watercraft, and the
      time I spent operating, maintaining, restoring, or simply studying
      the assortment of these which I was allowed‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääoften because of
      extraordinary circumstances‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääwould form the component of my
      psychology which seeks to experience different cultures, ideas,
      and eras through the medium of engineering and design and relies
      on these to understand them. Like my father in his youth, I would
      learn to clean water out of a carburetor after the Oliver 88 had
      sat silent for too long, and I would piss in a chamber pot to
      avoid waking up my Grandfather by walking down creaking attic
      stairs and turning the lights on. I would learn how to shoot and
      drive before 10-years-old, and I would have the freedom to do both
      as I pleased on the miles of gravel roads that ran around home.
    </para>
    <para>
      Though my stepfather bought me a PC of my own just as my
      first-grade computer class was ending, I could not conceive of a
      reason to occupy the dial-up line and block his incoming calls or
      faxes, so my use of the machine was limited to sparse writing and
      aggravating attempts to run Microsoft Flight Simulator 98 at
      approximately one frame per second on a 300MHz single-core Pentium
      II CPU. Though I was <emphasis>extremely</emphasis> fortunate
      compared to most middle-class kids my age at the time to have my
      own computer in my room, my relationship with it was not
      significant or particularly involved. I would leave it powered
      down for weeks at a time until my last two grades at Fairview,
      when homework assignments began to require it.
    </para>
    <para>
      Perhaps the greatest gap between my mostly-suburbanite classmates
      and I was an exposure to Japanese entertainment and video games. I
      was once disallowed from a lunch table because I‚Äôd never heard of
      Pok√©mon or Luigi, but I <emphasis>did</emphasis> have a Sony
      Playstation at home on which I occasionally loaded <emphasis>A
      Bug‚Äôs Life</emphasis> to wander around its first level, perhaps in
      basal awe at the idea of manipulating what I saw on a screen in
      realtime. In self-imposed isolation from children my age, I
      wouldn‚Äôt develop any need to be socially competitive with video
      games as many of my peers would to carry with them into adulthood.
      I thought my interests in mechanical engineering to be above all
      of them, so I spent my time alone with heavy picturebooks on 20th
      century cars, tractors, and airplanes.
    </para>
    <para>
      On the farm, my consistently agriculturally-proactive father was
      one of the first to have satellite internet for farm futures and
      weather reports on a pre-GUI machine which I don‚Äôt remember. As I
      was becoming computer literate in school, he would become
      extremely frustrated with the Windows XP-running machine he‚Äôd
      bought from a one-man, one-room computer shop in Centralia, and I
      would often solve some problem with bloatware or the goddamned
      printer. He would also subscribe to and install a first-generation
      DirectTV receiver, which had the first on-screen program guide I‚Äôd
      ever seen. In the evenings, I would watch hours of
      <emphasis>Modern Marvels</emphasis> on The History Channel, which
      presented the history, abstract functional theory, and
      implementation of a particular technology, both past and future.
      This single program‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääwhich has aired nearly 700 episodes since
      1995‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääis probably responsible for the majority of my at least
      rudimentary general knowledge in a variety of historic and
      ‚Äúfuture‚Äù technological schools, and my curiosity about culture‚Äôs
      relationship with innovation.
    </para>
    <para>
      Though my father‚Äôs interests differed significantly from mine‚Ää‚Äî‚Äähe
      thought more about growing and raising than of the tools one used
      to do it‚Ää‚Äî‚Äähe would indulge my many questions about how engines,
      hydraulics, and electrical systems worked, and indulged my
      curiosity by exposing me to the hidden communities of the most
      elderly, most obscure historic machinery enthusiasts like those of
      the Midwest Old Threshers Reunion in Mount Pleasant, Iowa‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääthe
      Concours d‚ÄôElegance for antique tractor and reciprocating engine
      collectors. It was a similar event closer to home where I first
      operated a steam tractor‚Ää‚Äî‚Äägreat, field-going locomotive-like
      vehicles that supplanted a need for horsepower in the late-1800s
      up until the Great Depression which chug, whistle, and puff along
      just like rail locomotives with a huge, gritty, iron steering
      wheel. As I recall, I was also given the opportunity to drive an
      unrestored Model T truck around the grounds that day‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääthe
      knowledge from which I gained I cannot imagine being of much use
      ever again.
    </para>
    <para>
      I was proud to the point of arrogance of my technical knowledge
      and experience in all the different things I had driven and
      operated, which my schoolmates were in no position to understand.
      I was elitist and anti-social about this as late as 8th grade,
      when I had just moved in to stay with my mother, who bought me a
      first generation iPhone which I proudly wore in a leather belt
      holster to Junior High. It would represent a shift in my
      fascination from very old technology toward the present and
      future.
    </para>
    <para>
      I started talking online with a friend I‚Äôd first met years before
      at Fairview, who spent most of his time fiddling with his
      first-generation MacBook Pro. He originally exposed me to gadget
      bloggers on YouTube like Mark Watson and Jon Rettinger (both of
      whom are still full-time tech personalities.) My mom bought me a
      13-inch aluminum-bodied MacBook (which would be sold as MacBook
      Pro after a single year,) and my lifestyle radically shifted
      inside my room, my computer, and my Xbox 360. My friend and I
      would both obsess together over software, design, and gadget ‚Äì
      experimenting with our own tech YouTube channels until high
      school, where I would be adopted by a new friend group who would
      finally socialize me.

      Recently, I have written about the contrasts and discrepancies of
      consumer technology development as its progress has disconnected
      from the upward linear trajectory in use, quality, and genuine
      innovation for the End User in a departure which has been
      especially visible from my perspective as an
      academically-untrained, but intensely demanding user in the past
      five years. When hardware was still the industry focus before
      ~2012, there was a tremendous amount of optimism among journalists
      and enthusiasts because each successive generation of devices had
      added more tangible capabilities. Publications like
      <emphasis>Gizmodo</emphasis> and <emphasis>Engadget</emphasis>
      made a fortune publishing reviews and comparison tests of hardware
      offerings across every segment of tech, and the discourse they
      generated had a noticeable influence on design. I remember this
      time well because it accented my last few years before adulthood,
      when I had plenty of spare time, energy, and curiosity to keep up.
    </para>
    <para>
      The general consumer technology narrative since Steve Jobs‚Äô death
      has become increasingly more about the companies who design and
      sell hardware and software than about how and why their consumers
      actually use them, and the result has been a series of new product
      segments with little defensible place in my own linear timeline of
      innovation, especially where productivity is involved. Augmented
      and Virtual Reality are quite explicitly escapist industries, yet
      to fill any significant need which was before unfilled. The same
      could be argued about voice assistants and smartwatches‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääneither
      of which <emphasis>remove</emphasis> obstacles in most users‚Äô
      day-to-day lives but instead <emphasis>contribute</emphasis> to
      the array of tasks and devices which already seek their attention.
    </para>
    <para>
      Of course, there are defensibly sound business incentives behind
      the industry‚Äôs new, fragmented direction, but I would also argue
      that there are those, too, for genuinely revisiting both
      <emphasis>what we should be doing</emphasis> and what we should be
      seeking to <emphasis>learn to do</emphasis> with technology. In a
      more abstract sense, I have written about whether or not we should
      want to be living in this particular now, and how the way we feel
      about the future should inform what we do in the present.
    </para>
    <para>
      I cannot help but observe human progress from a perspective of
      powerlessness, acute alienation, and amused awe, which has already
      lent to a significant quantity of occasionally original thoughts
      as I watch, having witnessed an odd diversity of American life and
      culture. I‚Äôve published them to entertain and to demonstrate a few
      methods of reflection on what it is <emphasis>you</emphasis>
      really want from the times you are living.

      makes sense here, set in Han‚Äôs formative, earnest youth‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääthe
      stated purpose of the film‚Äôs existence. Franchise fanatics, then,
      should be content. (It‚Äôs a good thing CGI-ing the main character
      in a live action film isn‚Äôt quite a low-risk option yet.) And yes,
      Donald Glover completely <emphasis>steals</emphasis> the vain,
      infinitely stylish Lando Calrissian and inevitably makes one wish
      to
      <link xlink:href="https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2018/05/lando-calrissian-movie-donald-glover">see
      him cast again</link>. Personally, I am very tired of seeing Woody
      Harrelson, though all the
      <link xlink:href="https://www.theguardian.com/global/2018/jan/07/woody-harrelson-i-used-to-have-my-head-up-my-ass-">components
      of his public persona</link> should all but ensure his likability.
      From
      <link xlink:href="http://extratone.com/three-billboards-outside-ebbing-missouri-review">what
      I saw in <emphasis>Three Billboards</emphasis></link>, I‚Äôd concede
      that he is as talented of an actor as I am capable of
      appreciating, but his role as Tobias Beckett in
      <emphasis>Solo</emphasis> couldn‚Äôt possibly be substantial enough
      to actually make use of his craft.
    </para>
    <para>
      Though I don‚Äôt believe in ‚Äúspoilers,‚Äù or use of the term to bait
      readers, it‚Äôs worth stating for the record what everyone should
      know by now: <emphasis role="strong">there simply aren‚Äôt spoilers
      in a Star Wars movie</emphasis>‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääevery human being on Earth knows
      too much about the formula to ever have any of these films‚Äô
      comparatively irrelevant plots ‚Äúruined.‚Äù The most surprising,
      historically-significant decision of this whole production was the
      <link xlink:href="http://screencrush.com/does-solo-have-an-opening-crawl/">omission</link>
      of the traditional yellow type opening crawl over a backdrop of
      distant stars, which I genuinely found myself missing. (Apparently
      it wasn‚Äôt present in <emphasis>Rogue One</emphasis>, either‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäI
      just failed to catch it.) I was very pleased to see my own number
      one favorite device of the franchise used within this film‚Äôs first
      ten minutes: crimelords and gang leaders as hugely magnified
      variations of the creeping and crawling creatures our instincts
      are planned to abhor. <emphasis>Solo</emphasis>‚Äôs first
      villain‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääthe gigantic, wormlike boss Lady Proxima (Linda
      Hunt)‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääis completely inconsequential, and only appears in a
      single scene, but the practice of grossly oversized monstrosities
      leaving absolutely nothing of a baddie‚Äôs essence to be
      extrapolated by the audience from nuance is one of very few ways
      these films are let loose, and it openly shits on the more
      pretentious viewer‚Äôs assumptions about good writing, which I think
      big money movies should feel more comfortable doing, generally.
    </para>
    <para>
      This first act begins on Han‚Äôs home planet Corellia‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääthe bleaker
      urban, industrial, working-class counterpart to the clean capitol
      cityworld Coruscant‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääwith his rather predictable mission to
      escape Lady Proxima‚Äôs sphere of control with his girl, Qi-ra
      (Emilia Clarke,) who could and should have been more creatively
      named, given her importance not as her own character with depth to
      develop (a no-no for a female role, Gourd help us,) but as Han‚Äôs
      mirror image to grow darkly apart, proving that he‚Ää‚Äî‚Ää<emphasis>The
      Good Guy</emphasis>‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääis unquestionably more morally fortified
      than anyone else in the whole goddamned universe. After having
      been drug through so very many, I couldn‚Äôt tell you at this point
      how to make the introductory escape action of this sort of
      production more exciting and less formulaic. Big surprise‚Ää‚Äî‚Äätheir
      plan goes awry, and Qi-ra is prevented from leaving the planet
      with Han, who‚Äôs immediate (and I mean
      <emphasis>immediate</emphasis>)solution is his enlistment in the
      Imperial Navy via the recruiting station right there in the damned
      spaceport (during which the film takes the liberty of seizing his
      surname‚Äôs explanation) to serve the English in their grand
      conquest of the universe. Bizarrely, he manages to serve as a
      grunt for <emphasis>three whole years</emphasis> of complicity in
      unmentioned atrocities until he encounters the disguised criminal
      Wise Old Woody in the middle of pulling a job with his two-person
      crew. The team doesn‚Äôt agree to bring Solo along until he meets an
      asset in Chewbacca for the first time as he briefly inhabits
      another of the classic <emphasis>Star Wars</emphasis> trap:
      <emphasis>the hungry monster in a shadow-filled mud
      pit</emphasis>, but is spared the wrath because of his
      introductory grasp on Chewie‚Äôs shrieking language (called
      <link xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20061201002846/http://www.starwars.com/databank/character/chewbacca/">Shyriiwook</link>)
      in which he manages to sufficiently pitch the advantages of his
      survival, and the two escape, chained together. Observing the
      addition of Wookiee to the deal, the crew briefly debates the
      prospect‚Äôs new value in providing ‚Äúneeded muscle,‚Äù which convinces
      Woody to return for them and kicks off a series of case studies in
      this film‚Äôs bizarre attitude toward the commodification of the
      oppressed.
    </para>
    <para>
      However, in a rare depiction of his volition, Chewbacca
      <emphasis>is</emphasis> briefly consulted before the two seek to
      be formally included on the job, and is even asked around a
      campfire, later, what he‚Äôs shooting for in life at the moment, to
      which he responds ‚Äúfinding my family/tribe.‚Äù Despite having spent
      a whole three hellish years in the trenches with the British, the
      romantic Han Solo declares his primary motivation for all of it
      still lies in his desire to return to Corellia and rescue Qi‚Äôra.
      In their stolen Imperial ship, the lot descend on a snowy
      mountain-traversing Maglev to steal the Uranium it‚Äôs transporting
      in a scene that‚Äôs straight up jacked from animated family classic
      <emphasis>The Polar Express</emphasis>, but‚Ä¶ <emphasis>oh
      no!‚Ä¶</emphasis> A gaggle of ‚Äúmarauders‚Äù called the <emphasis>Cloud
      Riders</emphasis> (yet another throwaway proper noun) roll up on
      <link xlink:href="http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/74-Z_speeder_bike">those
      speeder bikes from Endor</link> (except these can fly,) and screw
      up everything <emphasis>so</emphasis> badly that both of Woody‚Äôs
      crew end up dead and the booty scuttled. After the fact, Woody
      reveals to Han that the job was contracted by yet
      <emphasis>another</emphasis> carelessly-named crime
      syndicate‚Ää‚Äî‚Ää<emphasis>Crimson Dawn</emphasis>, and that his only
      possible course of action is now vigorous brown nosing to its
      leader, Dryden Vos (Paul Bettany) ((aka Scarred Jarvis,)) in the
      waning hope he‚Äôll spare his life to make another attempt.
      Following this information, he firmly suggests that Han and Chewie
      fuck off, lest their faces become known in the underworld, dooming
      them to serving it forever, apparently. Already, this vague
      presumption of Han‚Äôs purity which all of the protagonists must
      constantly venerate in martyrdom is getting tiresome, as is the
      dynamic of his insistence against them.
    </para>
    <para>
      Naturally, both Chewie and Han end up along for a visit to Scarred
      Jarvis‚Äô tower yacht, where the latter <emphasis>very</emphasis>
      conveniently stumbles upon none other than his long lost love,
      Qi-ra in the bar. Despite having spent the past three years at war
      in unspeakable conditions thinking only of how to liberate and be
      reunited with her, he isn‚Äôt bothered to express more than the
      moderately-excited and surprised hug you‚Äôd expect of someone who‚Äôs
      just run into the kid down the cul-de-sac from their childhood
      home who used to ride her bike over for popsicles on Sunday
      afternoons. While he does rehearse for her the tale of their
      reunification as his one motivation for everything since they were
      separated‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääincluding his presence there, ‚Äúright now,‚Äù he follows
      the profession up quite abruptly with the sly suggestion that they
      fuck as soon as possible. True to trope, she is jaded and
      indefinite as she distantly implies her binds of servitude while
      flashing the tattoo of the extremely-forgettable and innocuous
      Crimson Dawn logo on her right wrist. (The total lameness of the
      brands in this movie <emphasis>must</emphasis> be intentional. I
      can think of no other explanation.)
    </para>
    <para>
      The evil Scarred Jarvis is then introduced, quickly stealing the
      crown for Best Host of all <emphasis>Star Wars
      A</emphasis>ntagonists before politely asking Woody why he
      shouldn‚Äôt kill the lot of them. As per his infinite luck, Han
      pulls the idea of stealing <emphasis>unrefined</emphasis> Uranium
      out of his ass, which has somehow never occurred to anyone else in
      the room, despite their unanimous top-of-the-head knowledge of the
      single location where it is mined. Shortly, the merry three plus
      Qi-ra conveniently in tow are off to a casino-esque establishment
      to find Lando, who Qi-ra describes as ‚Äúattractive, stylish,
      charming,‚Äù and like adjectives, to Han‚Äôs obvious sexual chagrin,
      which is furthered by his subsequent loss of a card game with
      Lando‚Äôs ship‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääthe <emphasis>Millennium Falcon</emphasis>, of
      course‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääin the stakes. Of course, the attractive,
      beautifully-dressed black man only bests Solo‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääthe earnest,
      simpleton, <emphasis>Good Guy</emphasis> white dude who wears the
      same outfit for decades‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääin front of Qi-ra, the female prize by
      way of sleight-of-hand, the film shamelessly playing on that
      strange insecurity white guys have about their partners‚Äô secretly
      everpresent and very powerful temptation to dump them without
      warning for black cock. Further emasculation is inflicted on poor
      little Han when Lando turns his <emphasis>oh-so-crafty</emphasis>
      (actually just very charismatic) charm upon Qi-ra, who reveals
      that <emphasis>she‚Äôs</emphasis> the boss of the gig. The final
      blow to Han‚Äôs dickitude is cast when he tries to enter the
      negotiation between the two and Lando chides ‚Äúthe adults are
      speaking,‚Äù but eventually agrees to provide them a lift for a 25%
      cut, so the lot make preparations to leave.
    </para>
    <para>
      Enter my new favorite character of the franchise, Lando
      Calrissian‚Äôs co-pilot, L3‚Äì37 (voiced by Phoebe Waller-Bridge,) or
      ‚ÄúL3,‚Äù the proudly sentient, violently revolutionary pro-rights
      droid who is introduced as she is pleading with two fighting
      droids in a square cage surrounded by screaming spectators (easy
      does it on that thematic slavery) to circumvent their ‚Äúfighting
      programs‚Äù because they ‚Äúdon‚Äôt have to do this.‚Äù Though Lando and
      the crew behave like her duress is foolish and
      unimportant‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääpulling her away to the
      <emphasis>Falcon‚Ää‚Äî</emphasis>‚Ääshe is allowed another opportunity
      to free droids very soon, but not before
      <emphasis>Solo</emphasis>‚Äôs single short private conversation
      between two female characters.
    </para>
    <para>
      On the way to Kessel, Qi-ra stops by the cockpit and converses
      with L3. Until recently, I was unaware of what‚Äôs largely regarded
      as the worst habit of male writers with female characters:
      <emphasis role="strong">if and when they have a one-on-one
      conversation between another female character, it‚Äôs only about
      other male characters</emphasis>. Sure enough, L3 begins by
      insisting to Qi-ra that Han is in love with her, insisting by the
      objective findings of her sensors‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääwhich Qi-ra
      uncharacteristically denies like a bashful little girl before L3
      continues on about Lando‚Äôs longtime love for
      <emphasis>her</emphasis>, and why it must remain unrequited, which
      we are encouraged to laugh at by the doubt Qi-ra voices without
      much hesitation regarding the hypothetical union‚Äôs sexual
      mechanics because it‚Äôs so <emphasis>preposterous.</emphasis>(I‚Äôll
      get back to that in a moment.)
    </para>
    <para>
      When the team arrives on Kessel and infiltrates the mine, L3
      creates a ‚Äúdistraction‚Äù when she begins removing the restraining
      bolts from droids in the control room, calling the practice
      <emphasis>savage</emphasis>, or <emphasis>uncivilized</emphasis>,
      or maybe <emphasis>barbarian‚Ää‚Äî</emphasis>‚ÄäI don‚Äôt quite remember.
      As she frees them without any noticeable detraction from her
      duties as Seth Green of the heist‚Ää‚Äî‚Äähacking controls, remotely
      opening doors, and all that‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääthe droids begin to help free others
      in an exponentially multiplying circle of liberation until they
      become a rowdy mob who‚Äôs <emphasis>cute</emphasis> acts of
      rebellion are spaced throughout a few minutes of screentime in
      short jumpcuts off the other crew as they fight deeper into the
      mine. With the most significant emphasis ever placed upon
      Chewbacca in <emphasis>Star Wars</emphasis> history, he halts when
      he spies slave Wookiees struggling to find off enforcers and
      informs Han that he‚Äôs going to break off and assist them. Since
      Chewie‚Äôs only allowed to speak to the audience through Han‚Äôs
      retorts and never directly, it‚Äôs impossible to know how he phrased
      it, exactly, but from my perspective, his appeared to be the
      expression of a wish to do what Han had to
      <emphasis>agree</emphasis> to release him to do, as would a
      master, not a ‚Äúpartner.‚Äù Of course, Solo <emphasis>does</emphasis>
      agree, albeit hesitantly, because he‚Äôs <emphasis>The Good
      Guy</emphasis>, while quite inconsiderately expressing his desire
      to see Chewie again soon instead of wishing him success. However,
      releasing him to free his people (as per his primary life goal,
      expressed before,) means that Han has to load
      <emphasis>twelve</emphasis> of the <emphasis>super
      heavy</emphasis> unrefined Uranium tubes onto the cart
      <emphasis>all by himself</emphasis> and push it fully loaded at
      least <emphasis>50 whole yards</emphasis> without the assistance
      of his big strong slave. Boy, <emphasis>what a pain in the
      ass!</emphasis> He‚Äôs spared his laboring, though, when Chewbacca
      returns after no time at all with the enslaved Wookiees he‚Äôs just
      heroically rescued, who he then <emphasis>immediately asks to
      assist his master</emphasis> in pushing the cart‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääperforming the
      <emphasis>same labor</emphasis> they were forced to do under the
      enslavement they were supposedly liberated from, seconds before.
    </para>
    <para>
      The heist has inadvertently (nice, huge emphasis on
      <emphasis>inadvertently</emphasis>) ignited a slave rebellion
      throughout the mine, which serves the crew only as a distraction
      for the guards. The chaos is interrupted a half dozen times or so
      by those jumpcuts back to the control room of <emphasis>adorable
      little droids</emphasis> enacting their pitifully amusing revenge
      on the equipment‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääslapping a keyboard with a cookie sheet-like
      pan, stomping on a control panel, etc.‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääwhile L3 shouts parodical
      quasi-Marxist battlecries, which‚Ä¶ yes‚Ä¶ include referring to the
      freed droids as ‚Äúcomrades.‚Äù She even radios Lando at one point and
      triumphantly proclaims that she‚Äôs ‚Äúfound her true calling.‚Äù
    </para>
    <blockquote>
      <para>
        If and when a female character has a one-on-one conversation
        with another female character, it‚Äôs only about other male
        characters.
      </para>
    </blockquote>
    <para>
      By the time the Uranium cart is within its last few yards of the
      awaiting <emphasis>Falcon</emphasis>, the riot has reached the
      landing bay and the guards around its perimeter have readjusted
      their priorities to disabling the ship‚Äôs landing gear. This
      interrupts Lando in the cockpit, who has chosen this time to work
      on dictating his autobiography because he‚Äôs a man who bothers to
      dresses himself well and is therefore oh so <emphasis>maniacally,
      comically</emphasis>, and <emphasis>unreasonably</emphasis> vain!
      How berserk! Still looking good as hell, he emerges and stands on
      the ramp to cover the rest of the crew‚Äôs return and loading of the
      dangerous Uranium with blaster fire, shouting the obligatory
      intermittent ‚Äúcome on, hurry up,‚Äù until L3 appears, also firing a
      blaster and shouting until she arrives in front of Lando, before
      noticing some commotion(?) with droids behind her and turning
      around, again fervently shouting more liberation cries. Lando
      doesn‚Äôt budge from the <emphasis>Falcon</emphasis>‚Äôs side, but
      yells after her, until he watches as she is shot repeatedly and
      falls, prompting him to run to her side. Filmed unnecessarily
      gruesomely, her head and shoulders separate from what‚Äôs left of
      her lower body when he first tries to hoist her up. Of course, his
      recklessness gets him shot in the arm, so Chewie returns to carry
      them both to the safety of the ship, where the injured Lando holds
      her head lovingly in his arms for her last moments, repeating ‚ÄúI
      can fix you, I can fix you.‚Äù
    </para>
    <para>
      Now, I understand that <emphasis>Star Wars</emphasis> movies (or
      their reviews, for that matter) are not the sort of entertainment
      one seeks out in order to examine the dynamics of power structures
      or elaborate cultural symbolism, but they all contain a
      significant amount of both. The sterile, cold, and bureaucratic
      Galactic Empire is the British Empire, the Rebellion and the
      Republic are the United States or its colonial precursors, the
      Jedi are vaguely Native American, and the Death Star is the Boston
      Tea Party. You‚Äôve recognized this, I‚Äôm sure because it‚Äôs shoved in
      your ears most explicitly by their accents, and less so in your
      face by aesthetic influences, tactical philosophies, command
      etiquette, and posture, even. <emphasis>Solo</emphasis>‚Äôs main
      character is soaking in American Old Westness, which may or may
      not have led to its liberal saturation with the themes of
      individual rights, slavery, and liberation. Regardless, they‚Äôre
      certainly present, and most of them disturbingly for comedic
      effect.
    </para>
    <para>
      As a silent character to the audience, it‚Äôs understandable that
      Chewbacca had too many limitations to occupy a strong second to
      Han Solo‚Äôs lead in the narrative‚Äôs eye, and perhaps the
      relationship between the two as portrayed in the previous films
      reeked so strongly of servitude that it was an inevitable element
      when the time came to write them their very own movie. In direct
      contrast to the firm place of all droids in the social hierarchy
      of the last 9 movies‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääaddressing humans as ‚ÄúMaster,‚Äù
      unapologetically spoken of as property, and traded and/or gifted
      as such by both protagonists and antagonists, etc.‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääwhat we see
      of Lando and L3 together is a genuinely and complexly affectionate
      partnership between equals, which <emphasis>Solo</emphasis> makes
      an effort to emphasize, if only to laugh at.
    </para>
    <para>
      In response to the forced violence between two drones for
      spectator sport, L3 is completely enraged, and she cries (among
      other things) ‚Äúwe are sentient!,‚Äù but her distress is trivialized
      as hysterical distraction (see: <emphasis>Django
      Unchained</emphasis>.) When she suggests to Qi-ra that Lando (who
      is already illegitimized as a cheating narcissist, and therefore
      effeminate) is attracted to her, it‚Äôs a joke (which many in my
      audience laughed at) at the expense of her trivialized sexuality.
      After she triumphs and declares the liberation of her kind to be
      her true cause, she is immediately destroyed fighting for its
      sake, yet her ideology is not once acknowledged by her fleshy
      companions, and her body is quickly gutted for the data on her
      ‚Äúcentral processing unit‚Äù as it‚Äôs interfaced with the
      <emphasis>Falcon</emphasis>. Granted, Lando
      <emphasis>does</emphasis> thoughtfully muse ‚Äúshe‚Äôs part of the
      ship now‚Äù shortly afterward, which would be nice, if you‚Äôd
      forgotten his last words were an outright lie. Lastly, it‚Äôs worth
      noting how apathetic the main characters themselves are toward the
      Kessel miners, especially as they are packing up to leave, when
      the camera pans over the chaotic struggle between the liberated
      and their guards in very close proximity to the awaiting
      <emphasis>Falcon</emphasis>, yet there was not a suggestion that
      they would even <emphasis>consider</emphasis> letting them take
      refuge from the violence in their very spacious freighter. Aside
      from Han‚Äôs or Qi-ra‚Äôs, <emphasis role="strong">Solo treats
      liberation as charming or amusing, nothing more</emphasis>.
    </para>
    <para>
      Anyway, the crown jewel of <emphasis>Solo</emphasis> for many fans
      will probably be the scene of the infamous Kessel Run, when Han
      Solo and Chewbacca first take the helm(?) of the
      <emphasis>Millennium Falcon</emphasis> with Lando injured and L3
      dissected, using her ‚Äúnavigational database‚Äù to plot a very risky
      shortcut around the scary space cloud by the scary space squid and
      the scary space hole in order to make it to the site of the
      refinery before the volatile Uranium explodes. Once there,
      <emphasis>darn old flakey Lando</emphasis> fucks the hell of in
      the <emphasis>Falcon</emphasis> right as the Cloud Riders roll up,
      but <emphasis>whoa!</emphasis> their leader is actually a very
      young woman with freckles! She describes the atrocities of Crimson
      Dawn and suggests that Han (who‚Äôs now the established
      decisionmaker for whatever reason) give <emphasis>them</emphasis>
      the Uranium in order to establish ‚Äúthe beginning of a rebellion,‚Äù
      which we can safely assume is <emphasis>The</emphasis> Rebellion,
      which does beg one to wonder why Solo never once bragged among the
      later rebellion about having started the whole thing in the other
      films, considering that‚Ää‚Äî‚Ää<emphasis>whaddya know</emphasis>‚Ää‚Äî‚Äähe
      says yes!
    </para>
    <para>
      Woody, however, says he‚Äôs going to retire upon the news of this
      decision before immediately reappearing again on Scarred Jarvis‚Äô
      yacht after he‚Äôs revealed to have betrayed the Uranium ruse to
      him. Qi-ra ends up killing Scarred Jarvis, saving Han, but after
      promising to follow him and escape, she rings up the late Scarred
      Jarvis‚Äô boss‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääa Sith Zabrak who, I would argue, is <emphasis>not
      necessarily</emphasis> Darth Maul, though he probably is‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääand
      informs him that her boss is dead and she‚Äôs assumed his post. As
      Han and Woody meet again in an Old West standoff (complete with
      sand,) the latter insists <emphasis>one more time</emphasis> that
      Qi-ra is not who Han thinks she is (as Jarvis and Qi-ra herself
      have also said repeatedly,) describing her as ‚Äúa survivor,‚Äù before
      Han kills him in self-defense.
    </para>
    <para>
      Finally, after seeing the Cloud Riders off with the Uranium, Han
      finds Lando once again in a card game‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääthis time taking care to
      disable his sleight-of-hand device beforehand so that he wins the
      <emphasis>Millennium Falcon</emphasis>, ‚Äúfair and square,‚Äù and we

      Over two years ago, I concluded
      <link xlink:href="http://bit.ly/wigglecruise">my first work for
      <emphasis>Extratone</emphasis></link> about <emphasis>The Force
      Awakens</emphasis> by arguing that <emphasis>Star Wars</emphasis>
      on the big screen should be allowed to die in favor of investing
      the time, energy, and funding they require in the pursuit of
      something new, but the industry still appears to believe that
      nostalgia is a surer bet where profits are concerned, at least,
      even after two whole decades of mind-numbing reanimated
      properties. I didn‚Äôt catch <emphasis>The Last Jedi</emphasis>
      until recently, which was remarkably well-done measured against
      the others as a <emphasis>Star Wars</emphasis> movie, but
      certainly didn‚Äôt aim to achieve much more. Clearly, there must be
      some truth in Hollywood‚Äôs cowardice about original properties-
      especially when it comes to the sort of fantasy armed with potent
      but unguided emotional bombs that define the <emphasis>Star
      Wars</emphasis> universe, so it wouldn‚Äôt make much sense to revive
      my old diatribe, here. (Though I can assure you that I will be
      relentless if this horseshit continues for much longer.)
      <emphasis>The Force Awakens</emphasis> and <emphasis>The Last
      Jedi</emphasis>, though, were episodic titles for the family, and
      these spinoffs that began with <emphasis>Rogue One</emphasis> are
      supposed to be for‚Ä¶ well, I‚Äôm not entirely sure. In reality,
      they‚Äôve only moved the proverbial bar up a very wee bit to the
      family who occasionally says ‚Äúshit,‚Äù because they‚Äôre not
      intellectually stimulating enough to justify themselves as Big
      Boy-only productions. Or, they wouldn‚Äôt be, were they not part of
      this franchise.
    </para>
    <para>
      The truth is, the fans have grown up, and they‚Ä¶
      <emphasis>I</emphasis>‚Ä¶ will still buy a ticket for the smallest
      crumb of hope that a product of this huge machine will be capable
      of making us feel even a fraction of what we felt as children
      watching the original films. For me, <emphasis>The Force
      Awakens</emphasis> actually did, once, in that blast of horns
      before the opening crawl, but it hasn‚Äôt happened since, and I
      should certainly stop expecting or wanting to expect that it will.
      For others, it‚Äôs still working. Though there was a fraction of who
      I expected to be in attendance with me, they did laugh at a
      handful of (mostly fascist) moments, and whooped, hollered, and
      even clapped for a few seconds at the end. I‚Äôm surprised opening
      night wasn‚Äôt packed because Portland is the single most
      nostalgia-addicted culture I‚Äôve ever seen anywhere in the United
      States. Then again, there <emphasis>are</emphasis> a billion
      theaters here, so perhaps the sample is just lousy. We‚Äôll see how
      tomorrow and Sunday go, but I‚Äôd be surprised if any boxoffice
      records were broken.
    </para>
    <para>
      In the past, when film enthusiasts andfans have described Han Solo
      as ‚Äúthe best character in <emphasis>Star Wars</emphasis>,‚Äù they‚Äôve
      actually been praising his <emphasis>potential</emphasis> as a
      character, not his material itself, and
      <emphasis>Solo</emphasis>‚Äôs most effective function as a franchise
      film was to shut that praise down. Han was not at all denied his
      movie‚Ää‚Äî‚Ää<emphasis>this</emphasis> is <emphasis>his</emphasis>
      movie‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääand it provided him the screentime to show us who he truly
      is and why we <emphasis>really</emphasis> like him so much:
      <emphasis role="strong">he doesn‚Äôt fucking change</emphasis>. The
      secret to Han Solo‚Äôs moral and emotional resiliency is nothing
      more than halted development. The same old inner conflict between
      the tough, ruthlessly self-interested persona he does his best to
      project for everyone around him and the consistent reality of his
      soft insides was presented in his first scene way back in 1977,
      and we‚Äôre now sure that he was unable to make
      <emphasis>any</emphasis> progress toward its resolution despite
      openly and obviously brooding over it for an entire lifetime: from
      at least as early as his young adulthood in this film until his
      death at the hands of his little Sith son. <emphasis>There is 0
      variation</emphasis>. He <emphasis>always</emphasis> comes back
      for the cause at the crucial moment after declaring himself
      through with it. Without fail, he‚Äôll sacrifice the entirety of any
      self-making enterprise for just about any underdog with a problem
      who crosses his path. (Which probably explains his
      constantly-fleeting success as a smuggler well into gray hair and
      jowls.) <emphasis>Solo</emphasis> is abundantly clear about Han‚Äôs
      true nature and very willing to expose how uninteresting it is.
      When he first proclaims to Qi-ra that he‚Äôs become ‚Äúan outlaw,‚Äù she
      shuts him down with the film‚Äôs ultimate quote, insisting that she
      ‚Äúknows who [he] <emphasis>really</emphasis> is: <emphasis>the good
      guy.</emphasis>‚Äù
    </para>
    <para>
      If the video game-despising fans will bear with me for a moment,
      it‚Äôs worth noting that Bioware‚Äôs <emphasis>Star Wars: The Old
      Republic</emphasis> MMORPG is the most interesting and extensive
      source of nuanced narrative in the IP (it holds the world record
      for the largest voiceover project ever produced,) and most of it
      can now be experienced without actually playing the game. Like
      <emphasis>Solo</emphasis>, it‚Äôs set pre-saga, but considerably
      before‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääa few centuries, if I remember correctly, which gave the
      writers a gigantic opportunity to both expand and predestine the
      universe. There are eight different class stories with around 50
      cumulative hours of dialog, each. A few are relatively
      unimaginative, but the majority are complex, exciting,
      emotionally-involved tales that create very rich characters, and
      all of them can be streamed in their entirety on YouTube. If you
      are willing to see the potential of a Han Solo-like character
      fulfilled in a different medium, the
      <link xlink:href="http://bit.ly/torsmuggler">Smuggler class
      story</link> is a pretty damned engaging exploration of the
      <emphasis>kind outlaw with conflicted identity issues</emphasis>
      angle.
    </para>
    <para>
      From my perspective, <emphasis>Solo</emphasis>‚Äôs frequent
      less-than-subtle maltreatment of some very brutal and sensitive
      power relationships makes it the most toxic of the <emphasis>Star
      Wars</emphasis> films yet, and I assume it ended up that way,
      unnecessarily because Ron Howard is an all-American son of a
      bitch. If these titles are going to continue to be passed around
      between bigwhig directors, future unpleasantries are inevitable.
      Notably, I‚Äôve yet to see any mention of these disturbing themes
      from the respectable authorities of the film criticism
      establishment, who‚Äôve been overwhelmingly
      <link xlink:href="https://www.newyorker.com/culture/richard-brody/wookiee-nights-solo-a-star-wars-story-reviewed">charmed</link>
      by <emphasis>Solo</emphasis>‚Äôs nostalgia. Take from that whatever
      you will.
    </para>
    <para>
      If we continue to love the character Han Solo, it‚Äôll be in the
      same way we love our earnest, foolish, emotionally-stunted
      manchild fathers who‚Äôs developmental inadequacies are often
      embarrassing, sometimes abusive, and thoroughly pitiful.
      <emphasis>Solo</emphasis> leaves no more room for an idealized,
      elegant perception of this character‚Ää‚Äî‚Äähe‚Äôs no more than a
      <emphasis>pretty good guy</emphasis> with a lifelong addiction to
      thrill-seeking and a shitload of luck.
    </para>
    <para>
      To declare unequivocally whether or not <emphasis>Solo: A Star
      Wars Story</emphasis> is worth a trip the cinema with your date,
      your children, or just your own damned conscience would require me
      to disregard a whole host of complicating factors, but if you‚Äôve
      stuck it this far with me, you‚Äôd have a lot to disregard yourself
      to jump in. I‚Äôd advise that parents watch it themselves before
      deciding whether or not it‚Äôs something worth adding to your
      child‚Äôs life. Of those of you like me who‚Äôll tow the line despite
      what you know and watch a <emphasis>Star Wars</emphasis> film
      alone on opening night in delirium hoping for just a drop from the
      Fountain of Youth, I would ask: how long are we really going to
      keep kidding ourselves?

    <para>
      ‚ÄúTrue Tone‚Äù is so forgettable, everybody had to mention it first.
      Quite simply, it uses an ambient light sensor to fiddle with white
      balance, warming the colors of the display as an
      immediately-obvious whole, yes, but an interesting contrast to
      show off is no longer inherently justified in being called a
      ‚Äúfeature‚Äù in Apple products, anymore. Essentially, no matter who
      you ask (aside from
      <link xlink:href="https://youtu.be/AXU8GqaMsQc?t=7m23s">Jon
      Rettinger</link>,) you <emphasis>should not</emphasis> buy an
      iPhone 8, though I did last Fall, not only because I had to
      suddenly decide on a handset in less than 24 hours, but‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääif
      anything‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääto say goodbye to the form, the operating system, and
      the tech company which I have depended upon and carried with me
      virtually every day for my entire adult life. I‚Äôd originally
      decided to abandon this review due to a variety of unexpected
      circumstances, but Apple and its iPhone have maintained their
      place in the news with their
      <link xlink:href="https://www.apple.com/iphone-battery-and-performance/">battery
      scandal</link>, and a third of a year with the 8 Plus has included
      some experiences which warrant a send-off before iOS 12 is
      released, making it (and myself) totally irrelevant forever.
    </para>
    <para>
      As the longstanding benchmark of the smartphone industry‚Äôs state
      at any given time, the iPhone can be easy to reflect upon as a
      product once occupying a state of universal exemption from
      criticism, but it has, in fact,
      <link xlink:href="http://theweek.com/articles/459748/7-reviews-original-iphone-from-2007">never
      been so</link>. As Nilay Patel
      <link xlink:href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/9/19/16323570/apple-new-iphone-8-review-plus-2017">noted</link>,
      one might regard the 8 as the last compromise of ‚Äúbasically four
      years‚Äù of the same design. Since launch, it‚Äôs unsurprisingly
      stayed a wee bit too far behind on the spreadsheets for most
      Android-type folks‚Ää‚Äî‚Äänot that I‚Äôve ever believed them truthfully
      incapable of comprehending what it means to
      <emphasis>package</emphasis> a product, given where their greasy
      startups all eventually ended up. (<emphasis role="strong">You
      cannot doubt me</emphasis>‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäI once took a year-long sabbatical
      from iOS with a
      <link xlink:href="https://youtu.be/nSWgS0l0kc8">Sony Xperia
      Play</link>, and my authority is absolute.) The rest are trying to
      decide whether or not to pay $200 more for
      ‚Äú<link xlink:href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/iphone-8-apples-middle-child-1505322945">the
      phone of the future</link>,‚Äù which knows when you‚Äôre watching it,
      and is only good for playing half an hour of stupid video games
      before it needs a charge.
    </para>
    <para>
      So far, I have maintained that my first generation iPhone was the
      best handset of all time‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääone hell of an Email Machine that
      lasted me close to five years‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääthroughout the last two with
      actual motherboard exposed to the elements in the corner of its
      cracked screen. That said, who knows how it‚Äôd feel to be coerced
      into using ‚ÄúiPhone OS 2‚Äù as it was called, then, for an entire
      workday in 2018? Two years prior to bringing home an 8 Plus, I
      <link xlink:href="http://bit.ly/drycast47">vowed</link> that my 6S
      Plus would be my last ever Apple device, but this one
      <emphasis>actually</emphasis> feels like a last hurrah. Though the
      ability to <emphasis>Tweet directly from the swipe-down
      notification menu</emphasis> is still nowhere to be found (it‚Äôs
      been gone for 5 releases, now, and would seem to have been
      forgotten by <emphasis>literally</emphasis> everyone but myself,)
      one gets the sense that Apple‚Äôs efforts to add to the iPhone 8 and
      iOS 11 were to make amends with us by settling a few debts.
    </para>
    <para>
      In part, they did. Native apps got a major overhaul‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääincluding
      Mail, which was startling, considering that I‚Äôd been looking at
      what was near as makes no difference the same UI my eldest phone
      shipped with. As a result, it alone constitutes my benchmark for
      an email service, and I have been left without a clue as to what
      <emphasis>a good one</emphasis> looks like. (Apparently it was
      <link xlink:href="https://www.pcmag.com/article/342889/the-best-mobile-email-client-apps">really
      bad</link>?) Since time began, there has always been at least one
      alternative email app of the moment that tech journos refer to as
      the must-have, end-all replacement.
      <link xlink:href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/email-edison-mail/id922793622?mt=8">Edison
      Mail</link> is currently the smoother, faster, most modular
      option‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääat least for another few minutes‚Äì but I‚Äôll never know it
      as I know Mail, and I‚Äôll never want to. Playing around with
      experimental email apps is too scary. What if I decide once again
      to kill that massive number in the red badge and need to
      immediately mark 40,000 emails as read? It took all of my iPhone
      4‚Äôs 1.0Ghz CPU and proprietary software over 18 hours‚Ää‚Äî‚Äähow am I
      supposed to trust a shabby little 6-month-old startup with such an
      important task? Anybody with a hundred bucks can make an app, you
      know.

      <title>Why is the App Store now the best-looking publishing
      software on iOS?</title>
      <para>
        One might interpret the App Store‚Äôs redesign as an attempt by
        Apple to control this conversation‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääof both the trending
        <emphasis>new thing</emphasis> and the old‚Äúessentials‚Äù that

        company, though I‚Äôm not so sure I‚Äôm not the last remaining user
        who‚Äôs continued semi-regularly visiting their ‚ÄúToday‚Äù section.
        If I <emphasis>did</emphasis> want to actually read about apps
        (I don‚Äôt‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääwho does?) it wouldn‚Äôt make much sense to seek
        critical reviews from the faceless boffins behind the platform

        the tech news sites, paywall or no.

        Native screen recording could conceivably come in handy once or
        twice, but I see no reason why the red bar must remain at the

        lack of any such video in the wild. Front-facing 4K, 60fps
        capture is impressive, but useless‚Ää‚Äî‚Äävloggers all have GoPros or
        DSLRs, these days, and sharing through Snapchat and Instagram

        Two years ago, a new generation of social apps and the
        preposterous notion of a quad-core CPU in my iPhone 6S Plus
        seemed like the harbinger of a world I no longer understood.
        Now, most of those services have expanded to the far boundaries
        of my reach, and I‚Äôve stopped counting chips. Refinement of the
        hardware design is reverent to the extreme. It‚Äôs pretentious,
        but Apple‚Äôs decision to pause on the 8 to consider details like
        stuffing the legal text in the software and adding a little bit
        of weight <emphasis>back in</emphasis> for ergonomics‚Äô sake
        leads one to regard it as a monument to all the devices along
        the development timeline that have led to this‚Ä¶ last triumph.
        Or, it would have perhaps, had they not
        <link xlink:href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2018/02/apple-reports-first-quarter-results/">sold
        so many</link>.
      </para>
      <para>
        One could argue that good execution of consumer electronic
        design means minimizing as much as possible the obstructions in
        the way of the user completing any given task, and the iPhone 8
        Plus has surpassed the vast majority of these for myself‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääand I
        am, surely, a ‚Äúpower user.‚Äù iOS has changed a lot in the decade
        I‚Äôve employed it‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääin far too many ways for the worse‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääbut this
        pair of handset and software have reached
        <emphasis>my</emphasis> imagination‚Äôs limit for what I could
        possibly want to do. Augmented reality and wireless charging
        won‚Äôt ever have a place in my future, for better or worse. Face
        ID is much too peculiar. Surely, this iPhone is the ultimate
        expression of the first and fourth generation‚Äôs foundation.
      </para>
      <para>
        If the 6S Plus was indeed the key to my immortality, I‚Äôm afraid
        the 8 Plus heralds my imminent demise. Whether or not it‚Äôs an

      On a recent Tuesday, I opened a just-begun
      <link xlink:href="https://www.facebook.com/NASA/videos/10156260187261772/">livestream</link>
      on Facebook from NASA‚Äôs official page with a panel of experts
      discussing Europa‚Äôs plumes (or something like that) and ended up
      sticking around for most of its hour-long duration because of the
      ridiculous realtime comments from some of its ~4000 viewers. While
      some participants were genuinely interested in the opportunity to
      engage the host‚Äôs authority with relevant and invested questions
      (which were intermittently fielded,) the vocal majority were
      aggressive, ignorant, and provocative shouts. From my observation,
      the most noticeably manic and persistent of these came from user
      <link xlink:href="https://www.facebook.com/shane.langman">Shane
      Langman</link>. ‚ÄúNasa can telephone the moon in 1969 but can't get
      a phone signal in death Valley in 2018,‚Äù he noted 16 minutes in.
      ‚ÄúWe cant leave the earth or we'd have left it by now.‚Äù And there
      was Bobby Smith, who felt compelled to express his authority on
      NASA‚Äôs inauthenticity: ‚Äú[I‚Äôve] been researching since 2012 no real
      pics of anything all cgi.‚Äù

      Assuming the additional all-caps, sans-avatar ranting I remember
      reading live was deleted after the fact by the culprits and/or the
      page‚Äôs administrator, it‚Äôs worth noting that the remaining archive
      is full of sincerely positive feedback: ‚ÄúIt would be awesome to
      discover life in europe!!‚Äù Indeed.
    </para>
    <para>
      After a few minutes of gawking at the mess, I noticed that the
      broadcast was being simultaneously
      <link xlink:href="https://www.pscp.tv/NASA/1lDxLapRyjLKm">streamed
      on Periscope</link> (or is it Twitter Video? or Twitter Live?) so
      I opened both feeds side-by-side to compare their audience‚Äôs
      behavior. The Periscope‚Äôs viewers averaged about 1000 strong, and
      their comments were noticeably more orderly and decipherable.
      There was still trolling and self-promotion, but it wasn‚Äôt allowed
      to disrupt the rest of the committed discourse, perhaps because of
      each post‚Äôs character limit or rationed screen time. Looking
      between them, the contrast in the user culture and the function of
      the two services during the same, simultaneous stream was at
      discouraging odds with their respective popularity.
    </para>
    <para>
      Neither are really very good ways to watch live video ‚Äì Periscope,
      notably, was never designed for professional studio broadcasts ‚Äì
      but the relentless malicious nonsense from the Facebook viewers
      pushed all attempts at real engagement away so quickly that I
      could see no point in making them at all. To be blunt: every
      conceivable corner of Facebook is an unusable cesspool (even in
      the shadow of NASA earnestness,) and its worth considering that
      something about the design of Twitter properties generally
      discourages such overwhelmingly stupid noise. That‚Äôs not to say
      that harassment, hate speech, misogyny, and radical racism have
      not been religiously neglected or mishandled as has been
      well-reported throughout the network‚Äôs history ‚Äì perhaps even more
      than any other ‚Äì but I (a cis white man, mind you,) have seen
      <emphasis>much</emphasis> more of these on Facebook in the wild
      than I have on Twitter during my longtime use of the two, despite
      spending exponentially more attention on the latter.
    </para>
    <para>
      In my sparse Facebook browsing, I have witnessed childhood
      friends, professional acquaintances, and family members both
      distant and immediate publicly shame, harass, belittle, and
      spitefully argue with each other for the sake of absolutely zero
      meaningful resolution, conclusion, or intellectual progression. In
      my decade of daily Twitter use, I have seen tens of pedophiles and
      rapists publicly outed, suicides averted, government censorship
      circumvented, stories broken, artists made, and marginalized
      voices outspoken. I have also Tweeted things in the past (mostly
      variations of ‚ÄúI want to die‚Äù) that would now get my account
      temporarily suspended, as per the company‚Äôs
      <link xlink:href="https://mashable.com/2017/10/17/twitter-hate-speech-abuse-new-rules-women-boycott/">latest
      attempts</link> to minimize its platform‚Äôs toxicity ‚Äì an
      encouraging suggestion that Twitter is finally catching up and
      learning to avoid its <emphasis>cultural</emphasis> blunders,
      which have been the single greatest exception to its most valuable
      core identity: its mistakes.

      idiocy can be reasonably expected of Twitter, but bewilderingly,
      the Great Minds of tech journalism seem to be unanimously pleased
      by this decision, which invites one to suspect that they‚Äôve all
      switched secretly to the exclusive, illustrious
      <link xlink:href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/askjack/2017/may/18/windows-smartphone-still-worth-buying">HP
      Elite X3</link> ‚Äì the only smartphone on sale running Windows 10,
      because Twitter‚Äôs execution of these misaligned goals is
      mindbogglingly foul to look at and unnecessarily frustrating to
      use. After doing my best to put up with it for a few days, I found

      years: the 280-character limit, Explore tab, and Bookmarks.

      Then again, the ungainliness of Twitter‚Äôs new offspring could be
      attributed to the perpetual tragedy of its mother‚Äôs peril. The
      company‚Äôs luck has been on the down-and-out for eons in tech time:
      from its most recent
      <link xlink:href="https://www.wired.com/story/change-your-twitter-password-right-now/">plain
      text password blunder</link>, to its constant inability to

      and its identity as a social network remains dramatically tense
      well past its tenth year, which is good news for its continued
      survival. One could certainly
      <link xlink:href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/jan/05/can-donald-trump-save-twitter">argue</link>
      that the Tump presidency alone spared Twitter from a painful
      decline into irrelevance (or at least postponed it,) but I think
      we should acknowledge by now that turmoil is an integral component
      of the brand as an outlier in the connected community palette.

      For myself as a long-dependent occupant, its inconsistencies and
      contradictions are endearing and necessary ‚Äì a competent,
      profitable, and sensical Twitter may as well be Facebook. If
      you‚Äôve been Tweeting as long as I have, you‚Äôll likely remember
      that the company‚Äôs own offerings had occupied the bottom-most
      position in the hierarchy of preferable available clients
      throughout time and across all manner of operating systems until
      it finally nailed its Android and iOS software and usurped
      longtime third-party staples like

      relics of a different era in tech media, but it‚Äôs disheartening to
      find through research that the steadily-declining quality of our
      user experience has been allowed to continue without much protest.
      Justifiably or not, Twitter has persisted in adding stuff nobody
      likes as they‚Äôve gradually neutered all the great third-party
      development.

      TweetDeck for Windows was perhaps the most powerful mainstream
      enduser social application that will ever exist. Before
      <link xlink:href="https://techcrunch.com/2011/05/23/twitter-buys-tweetdeck-for-40-million/">Twitter
      absorbed the tool</link> in 2011, its
      <link xlink:href="https://youtu.be/HQhnbrwBfSw">diverse account
      integration</link> allowed a user to send a single post across
      Facebook, LinkedIn, MySpace, Google+, and multiple Twitter
      accounts simultaneously, and they could configure the client to do
      so with just the Enter key! In retrospect, it was naive to assume
      that such potent spam capabilities would continue to be entrusted
      to the general population without challenge, but the modularity
      and customizability of TweetDeck prime as a standalone application
      made it useful as hell and quite the power trip. Now, it exists
      only as a tamed, up-to-brand-guidelines
      <link xlink:href="https://tweetdeck.twitter.com">web
      application</link>, yet remains the definitive way to use Twitter

      This is how I‚Äôve seen desktop Twitter since I lasted looked at my
      timeline in 2010. Since then, I‚Äôve followed about 5000 more
      accounts, so I‚Äôd imagine it‚Äôs a damned mess. I have a private list
      of my friends, which I try to read in its entirety, and
      <link xlink:href="https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/lists/the-new">a
      list of nearly 500 journalists, publications, and musicians</link>
      whom I‚Äôve found particularly fresh and original. Thanks to these,
      Tweets are presented in order, uninterrupted by ads. (They
      function the same on iOS.) The network‚Äôs linear chronology is an
      absolute use condition for me, so I‚Äôm thankful I completely missed

      <emphasis>lists are linear</emphasis>. And since promoted and

      seen
      <link xlink:href="https://twitter.com/kikkujo/status/996613451349815296">the

      I have only once in my many using years been gripped by the fear
      of the Lord because of a software-related event. I was cruising my
      pitifully ugly Google News feed on an October afternoon in 2015
      looking for the last little bit of material for the evening‚Äôs
      episode of <emphasis>Drycast</emphasis>, when I happened to spy
      the words
      ‚Äú<link xlink:href="http://www.businessinsider.com/evernote-is-in-deep-trouble-2015-10">Evernote
      is in Serious Trouble</link>.‚Äù I doubt I screamed or anything, but
      I definitely remember experiencing a very real, full-body shot of
      adrenaline because <emphasis>my entire creative life</emphasis>
      was contained at the time within the nearly 40,000 notes I‚Äôd
      amassed on my Evernote account since the service‚Äôs
      <link xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120904074223/http://blog.evernote.com/2008/06/24/evernote-public-launch/">open
      beta</link> in 2008. In fact, I was in that very moment using it
      for the live show notes and so began to wonder how I could
      possibly continue if Evernote were to be suddenly killed dead. For
      better or worse, though, the ‚Äúunicorn‚Äù would indeed survive to see
      its tenth birthday this year, though it‚Äôs arguably been eclipsed
      by the notetaking, journaling, and word processing services its

      forerunner not so long ago.

      I‚Äôd been using the cloud-synced notetaking service for all of my

      thought myself extremely clever with my cloud-syncing,
      iPhone-native notetaking app when I‚Äôd watch other students

      Reading this via printed PDF, your hypothetical 100% offline
      grandmother‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääthe successful children‚Äôs book author who needs word
      processing but doesn‚Äôt require connectivity because she doesn‚Äôt do

      whatever was the matter with Microsoft Word? Surely I don‚Äôt need
      more than that!</emphasis> Technically, she‚Äôd be correct in a
      major sense: Word has been able to sync via Microsoft OneDrive
      between PC or Mac with iOS or Android for a while now, but I
      wouldn‚Äôt vouch for the latter for any use other than reading or
      very lightly editing a document because the relationship between
      the mobile apps and their desktop counterparts is inevitably
      strained. Because Microsoft Word is such old software, it‚Äôs filled
      with some obscure functionalities I‚Äôm sure even its creators have
      forgotten. Over years and years of development, these tools have
      been stacked on top of one another so that actually mastering the
      labyrinth could be a college major in and of itself.

      Basically, you can tell your grandmother that
      <emphasis role="strong">Microsoft Word is a huge old
      bitch</emphasis>, but it‚Äôs still the industry standard for
      formatting and publishing works at the end of the line. As you can
      see from our survey results, <emphasis role="strong">58.1% of you
      use ‚Äúlegacy‚Äù word processing software to finish up your first
      drafts</emphasis> (as of May 30th,) which makes you more modern
      than even a slightly-older population, I‚Äôd wager.
    </para>
    <para>
      While we‚Äôre on the subject of the old hag, it‚Äôs worth pointing out
      how ridiculously behind the times its open source ‚Äúalternatives‚Äù
      are. <emphasis role="strong">OpenOffice</emphasis>‚Äôs last major
      update was the
      <link xlink:href="https://blogs.apache.org/OOo/entry/a_short_celebration_and_then">release
      of version 4.0</link> in July of 2013, and it‚Äôs not correctly
      scaled for the small, high-DPI displays sold at just about every
      price level, nowadays. It was okay when I couldn‚Äôt afford to pay
      for a license in high school (and saw no reason to,) but it now
      looks sort of awful, especially considering that the version of
      Office (and therefore Word) to which I‚Äôm comparing its screenshots
      is actually <emphasis>also</emphasis> from 2013.
    </para>
    <para>
      The other, ‚Äúfresher‚Äù open source option of the moment is called
      <emphasis role="strong">LibreOffice Writer</emphasis>, and its
      suite has been attracting a fair amount of praise‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäI think
      ‚Äú<link xlink:href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/libreoffice-the-best-office-suite-gets-even-better-with-libreoffice-6-0/">every
      bit as good</link> [as Word]‚Äù is taking things a bit far, but its
      sixth version looks significantly better than OpenOffice on
      <emphasis>my</emphasis> machine, at least, and generally operates
      more smoothly as well. That age-old banner of <emphasis>Open
      Source</emphasis> won‚Äôt matter for much longer, though, if all
      kinds of software continue to be abandoned and substituted with
      Progressive Web Apps for
      <link xlink:href="http://bit.ly/uselists">no damned reason</link>.
      Considering how much time some of us have already spent in front
      of Word, it‚Äôs no wonder we‚Äôre spoiled: even my 5-year-old edition
      of Microsoft Office syncs with the app on my iPhone (with some
      pleading,) and looks <emphasis>extremely</emphasis> crisp. As far
      as paid featured desktop-class alternatives, there‚Äôs just one
      more: <emphasis role="strong">WordPerfect</emphasis>, which I have
      never used or heard anyone else mention.

      When it was conceived, <emphasis role="strong">Evernote</emphasis>
      pioneered the recipe that now serves as the foundation of the
      feature development in today‚Äôs notetaking and journaling

      ‚Äú<link xlink:href="https://techcrunch.com/2009/12/30/evernote-two-million/">life-logging</link>‚Äù

      well-accustomed to easily ‚Äúsnapping geotagged photos‚Äù (smartphones
      had always included location data in their photo files‚Äô meta, but
      Evernote was the first app to give a user access to the data
      <emphasis>on their device</emphasis>,) ‚Äúmaking voice notes,‚Äù or
      and organizing text notes via advanced categorization and
      metadata-enabled searchability. These features are essentials in
      the apps you could accurately describe as ‚Äúlife-loggers‚Äù available
      for download now. Snapchat‚Äôs ‚ÄúMemories‚Äù especially come to mind,

      Despite having imported my huge catalog of Evernote entries into
      DayOne, the former often gets stuck, and it‚Äôs retained the most
      irritating habit of all the software mentioned in this column.
      Because synced entries in Evernote are not live-updated like those
      in Google Docs or Dropbox Paper, it‚Äôs possible to modify or add to
      a note on one device while it‚Äôs open (and static) on another,
      which is addressed by either duplicating the most recent entry and
      filing it in the default ‚ÄúConflicting Changes‚Äù folder, or pasting
      the duplicate of the entire contents above the ‚Äúold‚Äù content in
      the note, separated by a horizontal line. I‚Äôve yet to figure out
      the behavior that triggers which fix, but I don‚Äôt particularly
      care‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäI‚Äôve decided to restrict my Evernote use to my desktop,
      absolutely. If I haven‚Äôt articulated it well enough for you to

      It was my stepfather who told me about Evernote and signed me up

      experienced extreme satisfaction in archiving and categorizing
      stuff (which is probably the most straightforward way to define
      <emphasis>nerd</emphasis>,) but he was especially and absolutely

      <link xlink:href="https://blog.evernote.com/blog/2008/06/26/web-clipping/">Web
      Clipper function</link>, which allowed the user to save webpages

      <link xlink:href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3026239/android/google-keep-3-years.html">savvy
      with integration</link>: you can immediately send your clip to a
      Google Doc, set a reminder, add a collaborator and even
      <emphasis>draw</emphasis> on any entry. Its party piece in this
      Tactile Era of touch-enabled laptops and keyboard-equipped tablets
      is its ability to digitize handwriting or ‚Äúgrab image text,‚Äù a
      novelty technology called Optical Character Recognition, which has
      been
      <link xlink:href="http://history-computer.com/ModernComputer/Basis/OCR.html">tickling
      our most stale fantasies for centuries</link>, now. Though I‚Äôm
      sure it‚Äôs genuinely appreciated in a handful of especially quaint
      use cases, somewhere in the world, there‚Äôs never going to be an
      at-scale application for this sort of thing. I know my handwriting
      is bad, but if <link xlink:href="http://bit.ly/keephand">Keep
      can‚Äôt ‚Äúgrab‚Äù it reliably</link>, there‚Äôs not much sense in using
      it at all for me, though Google‚Äôs Academy for Young Algorithms

      <emphasis role="strong">Microsoft OneNote</emphasis> is as clunky,
      busy, and buggy as Google Keep is quick and uninspiring, but
      that‚Äôs probably because it‚Äôs much <emphasis>much</emphasis> older
      than I remember. To demonstrate its web clipping function, I
      clipped the
      <link xlink:href="https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,1273091,00.asp">OneNote
      portion</link> of

      Microsoft Office 2003 review</link> and exported it into a
      <link xlink:href="http://extratone.com/library/onenote-pcmag.pdf">PDF</link>,
      which isn‚Äôt a straightforward process, but is it useful? No.
      Because it‚Äôs a PDF, it‚Äôs almost unreadably low-resolution, yet
      manages to weigh 1.2 MB. My (cropped)
      <link xlink:href="http://extratone.com/media/onenote2003.png">Vivaldi
      capture of the same page</link> is 988 kB and nearly impossible to

      OneNote at all? Well, according to

    <para>
      Then again, dearest Preston goes on to express his adoration for
      Evernote Web Clipping shortly afterwards and he did so just last
      year, so I won‚Äôt really claim to know what‚Äôs going on with him
      (he‚Äôs a legacy tech journo.) In my experience with
      twenty-somethings and younger, the more committed an artist or
      writer is to their craft, the less interested they are in its
      tools, but it‚Äôs the young ones who need great tools the most
      before they‚Äôre able to settle on and pin down their process. There
      was only <emphasis role="strong">a single writer</emphasis>
      (<emphasis role="strong">3.2%</emphasis>) surveyed who answered
      ‚Äú<emphasis role="strong">when I want to DIGITALLY record something
      to remember, I use‚Ä¶</emphasis>‚Äù with ‚Äú<emphasis role="strong">the
      ‚Äòcompose‚Äô function (to publish immediately and/or save for later
      as a draft) of a web-based text sharing service (Twitter, Tumblr,
      Medium, WordPress, Facebook, etc.)</emphasis>,‚Äù and
      <emphasis role="strong">one other</emphasis> answered
      ‚Äú<emphasis role="strong">another text-entry field on my device
      where it will be saved for later</emphasis>,‚Äù which
      <emphasis role="strong">four users</emphasis>
      (<emphasis role="strong">13.3%</emphasis>) said they use to
      ‚ÄúBrainstorm‚Äù digitally.
    </para>
    <para>
      By Question Set 3, the two alternative answers were dropped and
      for ‚ÄúOutlining‚Äù digitally,
      <emphasis role="strong">45.2%</emphasis> of surveyees use legacy
      word processors, <emphasis role="strong">35.5%</emphasis> use
      <emphasis role="strong">cloud-based notetaking apps</emphasis>,
      and <emphasis role="strong">19.4%</emphasis> use
      <emphasis role="strong">the default notetaking program installed
      on their device</emphasis>. In omitting alternative options
      earlier and including web-native CMS editors later, I inevitably
      shepherded answers within a moderately-wide berth of where my own
      assumptions would lead their process. It‚Äôs interesting that for
      the last prompt, ‚Äú<emphasis role="strong">to make the last
      modifications to my final draft, I‚Ä¶</emphasis>‚Äù a whole
      <emphasis role="strong">35.5%</emphasis> reported they would still
      be using a <emphasis role="strong">cloud-based service</emphasis>
      instead of a <emphasis role="strong">legacy word
      processor</emphasis> (<emphasis role="strong">58.1%</emphasis>) or
      <emphasis role="strong">CMS editor</emphasis>
      (<emphasis role="strong">6.5%</emphasis>), which would suggest
      that the functionality of these new e-enabled methods of
      composition has become truly important, indeed.
    </para>
    <para>
      Though it‚Äôs not necessarily unreasonable, it astounds me to
      consider how many Online users actually compose original drafts of
      <emphasis>huge</emphasis> works exclusively within publishing and
      blogging services like <emphasis role="strong">Medium</emphasis>,
      <emphasis role="strong">Tumblr</emphasis>, or
      <emphasis role="strong">Reddit</emphasis>, even. We currently
      cohabitate a literary sphere with
      <link xlink:href="https://kotaku.com/this-smash-bros-fan-fiction-has-3-5-million-words-s-899629991">impossibly
      massive works of fanfiction</link> that far surpass anything God
      or The Classics established in the past, and it‚Äôs a wonder how
      many <link xlink:href="http://bit.ly/redvonnegut">sour
      habits</link> have crept into the writing world as a result. For
      the sake of the experiment (and
      <link xlink:href="http://bit.ly/futureland9">my own
      education</link>,) I posted some of my recent work on
      <link xlink:href="https://medium.com/@ficklecrux"><emphasis role="strong">Medium</emphasis></link>
      and found its composition UI much improved from what I remember
      and comparable in many ways to those of more recent dedicated
      document editing/notetaking services, but there‚Äôs still whole set
      of abstract, less-than-technical reasons not to
      <emphasis>publish</emphasis> on Medium, much less compose there.
    </para>
    <para>
      Briefly: instead of
      ‚Äú<link xlink:href="https://blog.medium.com/renewing-mediums-focus-98f374a960be">defining
      a new model for media on the internet</link>,‚Äù CEO Ev Williams and
      company ended up creating an isolationist community with
      <link xlink:href="https://medium.freecodecamp.org/how-to-write-medium-stories-people-will-actually-read-92e58a27c8d8">hellishly-skewed
      priorities in craft</link>. Virtually all of what‚Äôs actually
      <emphasis>born</emphasis> on Medium is of a certain soulsucking,
      less-than-productive quality (notable exceptions include
      <link xlink:href="https://medium.com/@ryandeel">Ryan Dell</link>,
      <link xlink:href="https://medium.com/@davepell">Dave Pell</link>,
      and work from marginalized voices that would not otherwise be
      written or published.) Though their founding principles of
      ad-model disruption are redeemable and entirely sincere, I‚Äôm sure,
      their result doesn‚Äôt actually solve anything at all, especially
      after

      As for <emphasis role="strong">Tumblr</emphasis> and
      <emphasis role="strong">Reddit</emphasis>, I‚Äôm afraid I‚Äôve never
      been capable of truly understanding either, but I did blog
      extensively about cars for the first time 5‚Äì6 years ago on the
      former when it was one of significantly fewer fee-free options for
      digital publishing, and even then the experience was already
      casting doubt on the true necessity and existence of blogging
      platforms like WordPress‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääespecially for web
      development-abhorring peons like I was at the time. Now, its iOS
      app is gorgeous, and its editor has ended up rock-solid and
      surprisingly versatile, yet the state of its community, also,
      leaves one with little reason to publish aside from a sortof
      isolationist desire to contribute to <emphasis>the community
      itself</emphasis>, for Tumblr‚Äôs sake.
    </para>
    <para>
      This is where <emphasis role="strong">WordPress</emphasis> should
      outshine everything else as a pure, open-source Content Management
      System for any and every use by any and every folk with server
      space, so I thought I‚Äôd try out
      <link xlink:href="http://extratone.com/shife">my own fresh,
      ultra-connected install</link> to see how its experience has
      changed. In word processing terms, its
      <link xlink:href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/wordpress/id335703880">iOS</link>
      and
      <link xlink:href="https://apps.wordpress.com/d/windows/">Windows</link>
      clients are <emphasis>lightyears</emphasis> ahead of where they
      were a few years ago, but to take full advantage of them, one must
      allow WordPress‚Äô own software access that‚Äôs
      <link xlink:href="https://www.wpexplorer.com/jetpack-wordpress-plugin/">not
      <emphasis>Open Web</emphasis> at all</link>. For light, minimalist
      personal blogs, a WordPress site offers much more control over
      one‚Äôs intellectual property than Medium or Tumblr, but it‚Äôs also
      significantly less independent than it once was. A quick
      inspection of my little experiment reveals that 5 out of its 6
      content sources are from Google or WordPress properties, leaving
      only one for <emphasis>my</emphasis> actual server. This means I
      can accomplish a lot using just their apps, and my work will be
      distributed among ‚Äúbillions of posts‚Äù across WordPress dot com (to
      be found by absolutely nobody, I suspect,) but the post editor
      within the CMS itself has never functioned quite so versatility as
      it does right now. And yet, neither WordPress nor any of the
      software I‚Äôve covered thus far achieve much progress toward an
      ideal, comprehensive word processing solution.

      That‚Äôs why I‚Äôd like to talk about <emphasis role="strong">Dropbox
      Paper</emphasis>, which has been my own browser‚Äôs homepage and
      primary text editor since
      <link xlink:href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/8/4/12373696/dropbox-paper-ios-android-sharing-docs">its
      public beta went live</link> in August of 2016, and it‚Äôs very hard
      not to dote on considering that it is definitively the single most
      useful software addition in my whole computing life. It‚Äôs a
      live-updating exclusively web-based (for now) service with an
      emphasis on collaboration, just like the industry-standard
      monstrosity that is <emphasis role="strong">Google
      Docs</emphasis>, but it‚Äôs been designed from the ground-up to
      perform best the operations you need most from a word processor in
      2018, which doesn‚Äôt include advanced layouts, fine-adjustable
      paragraph and/or letter spacing, Excel integration, or voice
      dictation, but simply‚Ä¶ typing and re-reading and editing. You‚Äôd be
      surprised what a handy productivity catalyst can become of a
      simple white, live-updating space without distraction available no
      matter where you are or what device you‚Äôre in reach of.
    </para>
    <para>
      Virtually <emphasis>all</emphasis> of my ‚Äúprocess‚Äù is now
      conducted within Paper, and I‚Äôve never before experienced such an
      unconscious assimilation of use. I write about software because
      I‚Äôve used a lot of it and I‚Äôve been able to count on my ability to
      find fundamental mistakes/designed ignorance in most everything.
      Dropbox Paper, however, is so keenly perfect for my own needs that
      I slipped unconsciously into total, daily dependence upon it
      without noticing the transition at all, which has never,
      <emphasis>ever</emphasis> happened before. Notes can begin from
      blank Text/Title fields to <emphasis>Brainstorming</emphasis>,
      <emphasis>Meeting Notes</emphasis>, and <emphasis>Project
      Overview</emphasis> templates. In April, the team
      <link xlink:href="https://blogs.dropbox.com/dropbox/2018/04/dropbox-paper-templates/">introduced
      the ability</link> to ‚Äútemplatize‚Äù any document, which I‚Äôve yet to
      explore but will no doubt make full use of for show notes when
      <link xlink:href="http://extratone.com/futureland"><emphasis>Futureland</emphasis></link>
      is revived. There are also
      <link xlink:href="https://blog.evernote.com/blog/2017/05/05/uncovering-templates-hidden-gem-evernote/">Evernote
      templates</link>, yes, but you cannot create your own, and
      downloading them is an unnecessary pain in the ass.

      Landing on the root, you‚Äôll see Folders, Starred Folders, Starred
      Entries, and Shared Documents all displayed chronologically by
      modification date. Instead of tags, categories, or ‚Äúnotebooks,‚Äù
      Dropbox Paper‚Äôs folders are its singular method of categorization,
      and they are astoundingly sufficient, even when editing multiple
      documents simultaneously or digging through professional and
      personal entries within a single account‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääall thanks to its
      search function, which is super-swift and superior to any other
      service because of its profound simplicity. It‚Äôs one of many
      experiences which laughably shame past efforts in the design of
      these tools: without any customizable search filters or metadata
      and
      <link xlink:href="https://www.dropbox.com/help/paper/find-docs">by
      sifting only through title, content, and author</link>, any note
      in Paper can be found <emphasis>instantly</emphasis> no matter how
      dated or obscure. I doubt I‚Äôve yet to top 1000 entries quite yet
      (there‚Äôs no easy way to count, and <emphasis>why should there
      be</emphasis>, really,) but on several occasions I‚Äôve found
      years-untouched, untitled documents within seconds‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääa process
      which has <emphasis>never</emphasis> been brisk or convenient in
      Evernote.
    </para>
    <para>
      Though Dropbox Paper wasn‚Äôt necessarily designed for composing
      5000+-word longform, it‚Äôs by far the best tool for the vast
      majority of the pre-publishing process (to a reasonable extent, of
      course‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäI wouldn‚Äôt use it for a screenplay or novel manuscript.)
      It‚Äôs rare for me to utilize its mastery of collaboration, these
      days, but there‚Äôs frankly little reason to go anywhere
      else‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääincluding Google Docs‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääconsidering that Paper documents
      can be bound by the same viewing and editing permissions: by
      individual entry or folder, marking live modifications with clean,
      color-coded initials in the sidebar, by email or rogue URL for
      editing, commenting, and/or reading. (The comments interface is
      the best I‚Äôve ever seen by a wide margin.) Users can be assigned
      and ‚Äúpinged‚Äù for tasks using ‚Äú@,‚Äù and it‚Äôs reasonable to assume
      that permissions won‚Äôt ever present an issue for my own use
      considering they haven‚Äôt already. To a limited extent, notes can
      be easily ‚Äúpublished‚Äù via shared links yet remain editable in
      realtime, making Paper perfect for obscure-but-public reference
      documents like <link xlink:href="http://extratone.com/style">our
      style guide</link> and
      <link xlink:href="http://extratone.com/redirection">redirects

      From the onset of use, you‚Äôll marvel at how fucking fast and
      smooth the in-browser experience is regardless of your device‚Äôs
      age or dimensions. Surprise surprise‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääthe iOS app works just as
      smoothly and is laid out vaguely like a Twitter client.
      ‚ÄúBrowse‚Äù‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääthe chronological timeline of documents‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääoccupies the
      leftmost bottom button as ‚ÄúHome‚Äù‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääthe main timeline‚Ää‚Äî‚Äädoes in
      Twitter‚Äôs app, and ‚ÄúNotifications‚Äù is likewise the same icon
      (practically) in the same position in both, and the items
      themselves are even grouped with rich card-looking content
      previews. Perhaps these nods to my Twitter muscle memory have
      contributed to my own unusual bias, but I suspect it shares
      components with a particular demographic of professional writers.
      As I understand the day-to-day activities of a
      feet-on-the-pavement reporter, Dropbox Paper is a necessity in a
      ridiculously all-encompassing sense. With its Slack integration,
      <link xlink:href="https://blogs.dropbox.com/dropbox/2017/03/paper-hidden-gems/">super
      high-usability design</link>, collaborative modularity, ultra
      copy-and-paste-friendly text, smooth hyperlink behavior, light
      weight, and ultimate compatibility, it should be evangelized as a
      no-brainer option in journalism. <emphasis>Fuck</emphasis> a Bic

    </para>
    <para>
      Web Clipping may be completely alien to its vocabulary, but you
      can drag and drop documents in just about any format for a
      beautifully-embedded preview. Conveniently,
      <link xlink:href="https://www.dropbox.com/help/paper/dropbox-integration">they
      won‚Äôt even count against your Dropbox upload quota</link>:
      ‚ÄúDropbox Paper doesn‚Äôt place a limit on the number of docs you can
      create, and includes unlimited version history regardless of the
      Dropbox plan you are on.‚Äù Naturally, this is subject to change in
      the future, but I‚Äôm 95% positive that Paper has yet to refuse any
      of my uploads because of their size or format, and many of mine
      are extraordinarily huge.
    </para>
    <para>
      There is a perfect power to Paper which I can only beg its
      stewards to leave unmolested for as long as possible. If I was a
      billionaire, I‚Äôd immediately purchase it from Dropbox and leave
      everything to the company‚Ää‚Äî‚Äärevenue, janitorial development, user
      data, etc.‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääexcept the right to make any significant feature or
      functionality additions to the user experience, as I have never
      before felt this way about a single service or program‚Ä¶
      <emphasis>ever</emphasis>. I‚Äôm not sure if I should keep quiet or
      incessantly kiss ass, but my interest undoubtedly lies in
      preserving Paper as it is. If you‚Äôre left doubting my own
      testimonial, there are a billion throwaway ‚ÄúDitch Google Docs for
      Dropbox Paper‚Äù posts across the B and C-list technosphere.

      would appear</link>.) I recall installing it on my 6S Plus, then,
      after spying some screenshots of its multicolored notes, but I
      failed to find room for its use. When the (completely useless)
      Files app was added with iOS 11, I played around with it for a bit
      and somehow ended up setting Zoho as the default application to
      open PDFs which inadvertently launched my 8 Plus into an infinite
      loop of ‚ÄúOpen __ in __?‚Äù prompts that eventually required deletion
      of Notebook in order to view them at all. I tend to especially
      adore these programs in their early, innocent versions when they
      smell most of innovation before their creators are inevitably
      brought back to our filthy reality when their VCs start expecting
      <emphasis>money</emphasis>. Zoho Notebook should have bewitched my
      affections, but my short trial was clunky and disastrous and those

        Bear lets you tag notes by adding a hashtag to a word anywhere
        in your document; you can add as many as you like, and then
        browse them later from the left rail. You can export your notes
        as PDFs, rich text files, HTML documents, or even JPEGs. And it
        supports ultra-nerd automation, so if you use an iOS app like

      DayOne‚Äôs own markdown support and exporting capabilities surely
      make it Bear‚Äôs predecessor. JPEG exports are a nice touch and they
      reflect awareness of what power notetakers like Newton
      <emphasis>actually do</emphasis> with their software. If I had not
      already chosen to
      <link xlink:href="http://bit.ly/spectreinred">depart OSX</link>,
      long ago, I would seriously consider downloading the app on both
      platforms and paying its monthly $15 membership fee to try out
      syncing, but I suspect Google‚Äôs moderate but noticeable influence
      on their design would quickly prove to be a turn-off, personally.
      I had a go at Bear‚Äôs free iOS experience and saw little functional
      difference from DayOne‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääif anything, text didn‚Äôt look quite as
      sharp‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääbut its reported integration with Siri Shortcuts is
      intriguing.

      try‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääespecially if your desktop-class machine is a Mac‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääand for
      your sake, I would hope they choose to utilize the power of the
      modern browser with a web interface in the future. ‚ÄúAs a writer, I

      with more brevity than I‚Äôm capable of in this discussion.

      Much of anything has yet to be written about these offerings in
      2018, but I must insist both regular and intermittent writers
      alike give Dropbox Paper a try. I suspect you‚Äôve less ‚Äúprivacy‚Äù to
      ‚Äúlose‚Äù than you would in Google Docs, and its sublime function as
      a writing tool extends from workplace collaboration to shared
      grocery lists with your SO and long, image and hyperlink-saturated
      works like this one. It‚Äôs very difficult to break‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääeven by
      pasting fragmenting code or Zalgo text; it‚Äôs never out of date,
      and always a short, teeny pageload away even across the worst of
      connections. As someone with an unhealthy obsession with his
      written work, I can tell you that its UI is by far the most
      anxiety-relieving I‚Äôve ever used. As an alternative to Google
      Docs, I would point out that 1) Docs supersedes Paper in sum
      features <emphasis>significantly</emphasis> less than you‚Äôd think
      and 2) for the one or two weird formatting challenges it fails to
      complete, neither Microsoft Word‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääthe old bitch‚Ää‚Äî‚Äänor Docs are
      going anywhere, and Paper exports to both of them directly.

      Curiously enough, I was required to use every single method of
      text retention of which I am capable in the course of writing this
      piece, as I tripped over my laptop‚Äôs charging cable‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääa physical
      connection, yes (and with substantial leverage) because Apple
      won‚Äôt allow other computer manufacturers to make use of ‚Äútheir‚Äù
      ingenious magnetic charging solution which they‚Äôve included as
      ‚ÄúMagSafe‚Äù on MacBooks since 2008‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääperhaps inevitably ruining the
      port and leaving me with only my iPhone and pens. I filled a few
      folded sheets of paper with
      <link xlink:href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BgErFqhFvyT/">my
      LAMY Safari</link> (which is good, but overrated,) and felt quite
      ridiculous in the process. Thanks to my fianc√©‚Äôs generosity, I
      type this bit now on her Panasonic R440 Electric Typewriter, which
      must still be considered a legitimate means of writing text in
      2018 if only because of
      <link xlink:href="https://theoutline.com/post/2488/collin-andrew-yost-the-most-hated-poet-in-portland">Instagram
      poetry</link>. According to
      <link xlink:href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00005QT7B/ref=as_li_ss_tl">its
      rather dubious listing</link> on Amazon, this model dates to
      September 4th, 1973, which is remarkable considering its
      spellcheck and auto-margin functions (neither of which I could
      actually figure out how to use.) If there is anywhere to be caught
      clacking away on a typewriter out of preference (I‚Äôd hesitate to
      call even my own situation one of <emphasis>necessity</emphasis>,)
      in 2018, it would undoubtedly be Portland, yet I am still
      extremely embarrassed to be the source of all this racket and
      would immediately perish if any of my neighbors bothered to track
      it down.

    <para>
      Even this very sophisticated example of the typewriting species is
      limited by one‚Äôs supply of both ink and erasing ribbon, though
      either can still be found for sale, remarkably. I am even less
      able to easily correct mistakes than those I wrote by hand because
      I feel a significant pang of pain via my mechanical empathy every
      time I use (or accidentally misuse) the function which whites out
      text with a sickening <emphasis>clunk</emphasis>. There‚Äôs
      something about this process which makes it feel more taxing,
      costly, and timeconsuming than any other, but perhaps with time
      and extended use, my embarrassment, empathy, and hesitance would
      fade and I‚Äôd become a cruel, loaded God of shitty prose, but I
      have no intention of finding out. I‚Äôll willingly concede that
      restored or refurbished typewriters can be
      <link xlink:href="https://twitter.com/FickleCrux/status/923340941129170944">absolutely
      gorgeous</link>, and there‚Äôs probably some validity in the
      ‚Äúdistraction-free writing environment,‚Äù but I‚Äôd suggest that
      anyone who‚Äôs pounded out any significant chunk of copy knows that
      one must find a groove of absolute focus within a word processor
      in order to complete work with any efficiency or cohesion, anyway.
      I‚Äôm as connected as any of you, yet these days, I always end up
      <emphasis>hyperfocused</emphasis> on Word, Dropbox Paper, and/or
      research in my browser to the exclusion of anything else on the
      machine, whether or not I intend to do so. I‚Äôm no authority, but I
      can‚Äôt see a functional place for a typewriter in 2018.

      Portlanders, surely, are vain enough to avoid leaving such
      disastrous drafts laying about, though now‚Äôs a good time to note
      that one can now scan their typewritten document into a word
      processor using native software on their smartphone, nowadays, if
      they‚Äôre so unreasonably inclined. Using iOS default Notes app, I
      could scan this physical draft into Portable Document Format with
      just a few steps, but doing so would contribute to the ridiculous
      perception that Adobe‚Äôs ancient, clunky standard is the ultimate
      end of the line for any and all digital publishing. Yes, it‚Äôs
      ridiculous to consider ‚Äú25 years‚Äù of development led to PDF 2.0‚Äôs

      Perhaps one could argue that this role in our collective academic

      which would inevitably lead them to criticize Adobe‚Äôs longtime
      occupation of it, but to examine the <emphasis>next</emphasis>
      significant step in the development of word processing is (this
      moment, at least) extremely hellish and alarming. This
      ‚Äú<link xlink:href="https://youtu.be/LxviGskApcw">Virtual Reality

      Just <emphasis role="strong">32.3%</emphasis> of survey
      respondents claim they print ‚Äú<emphasis role="strong">at least one
      draft and use a pen or pencil to make notes/mark corrections by
      hand</emphasis>,‚Äù not including the additional
      <emphasis role="strong">6.5%</emphasis> who
      ‚Äú<emphasis role="strong">print at least one draft but make all
      corrections digitally</emphasis>,‚Äù leaving
      <emphasis role="strong">61.3%</emphasis> who presumably do not
      physically print at all throughout their writing process. Our
      survey is broad, rudimentary, and not entirely scientific, yes,
      but I would bet these numbers would contrast significantly with
      those from respondents exclusively in academia. For myself and my
      colleagues, there remains ‚Äú<emphasis>something</emphasis>‚Äù that
      can only be attained by physically manifesting written work,
      perhaps in requirement of tangible manipulation in order to
      thoroughly comprehend large bodies of information. As I‚Äôve passed
      100,000 words within the rough draft of my novel project, no
      amount of skimming on any sized screen has enabled me to catch the
      typos and inconsistencies which become
      <emphasis>immediately</emphasis> obvious as soon as I have the
      most current printed manuscript in my hands. I doubt even total
      immersion into one‚Äôs work via some VR-capable word processor would
      do much to assuage this discrepancy‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääor much at all, for that
      matter, aside from casting writers into their own special hell.
      Surely, only the most self-loathing of them would voluntarily
      choose to be so dunked. (Read: drowned.)

      many of which I did not entirely shed when I tried again. Until I
      started Extratone and made doing ‚Äúthis‚Äù ‚Äì incessantly
      reading/exploring the web, obsessively tinkering and experimenting
      with The Extranet ‚Äì I actually had very little knowledge on or
      exposure to the state of digital publishing or the real depth of
      variety to be found with any significant effort to comprehend the
      current offering real, surviving magazines, online or not, yet was
      dumb and arrogant enough to assume that I‚Äôd seen it all and none
      of it was even close to good enough for me to read or seek to
      write for. I was actually delusional enough to regard myself as
      too smart and one-of-a-kind to lower myself by going back to
      journalism school ‚Äì that I was so special, anything I put effort
      in creating was destined to turn out superb. Granted, I‚Äôd had the
      actual idea for less than two weeks before I experienced by far
      the most traumatic, soul-destroying, world-upturning, and
      life-altering event of my entire existence, which I think accounts
      for the insanity, and all of my decisions were inevitably
      preempted by the fact that I was a 21-year-old straight white male

      weekly obligation to sit down and talk with my favorite people

      institutionalized in 2015 (I wish I was exaggerating.) If there is

      Reading and compiling stories for the show notes throughout the

      rationality in the tone which journalists generally adhere to that
      has drawn me in and provided a brighter and brighter guiding light
      to help keep my sanity in check after my world ended because New
      Media values empathy in tandem with critical thought. All my life,
      it‚Äôs been very important to me that I continue to learn the best
      way to both appear and feel smart and functional. I‚Äôve long since
      accepted that I am very fucking weird ‚Äì and not in the wow, I dye
      my hair bright red sort of way which helps people feel unique, but
      in the holy shit, I‚Äôm terrified of what would actually result in
      losing control of my facade sort, which is actually much less
      sinister than it sounds for you, and infinitely moreso for me.

      overwhelmingly frustrated with those who socially emphasize and
      celebrate their ‚Äúweirdness‚Äù as an important part of their identity
      because my self-perception has long since transitioned from
      regarding my deviations as something that made me ‚Äúunique,‚Äù to
      gigantic obstacles in the way of every possible aspiration which
      I‚Äôll probably never overcome, but am doomed to kill myself trying.
      I‚Äôm now working on learning to appreciate those very fucking
      common people who are determined to prove how strange they are
      because ultimately, my own self-perception is just as ignorant,
      loneliness is not a virtue, and I‚Äôve only maintained the whole
      charade because I‚Äôd rather have delusions of grandeur than
      acknowledge that I am also mostly unoriginal, and most of my truly
      more ‚Äúoriginal‚Äù behaviors could easily be described as simply
      unhealthy.

      This is an important confession for this explanation because its
      ‚Äúsolution‚Äù is another crucial motivation behind my creation of
      Extratone ‚Äì as both a symbolic and literal means of understanding
      and minimizing my own biases and bitterness by 1) surrounding
      myself with the huge amount young, talented people I knew with
      great ideas and 2) editorially committing to curiosity as the most

      stand it and the heartbreaking number of those who actualize
      themselves by trying to act aggressively apathetic toward the
      status quo. This sense is far from 100% reliable and is certainly
      not of a greater quality than everyone on Earth, but I would still
      confidently suggest it‚Äôs at least better than most, and ‚Äì as most

      to improve myself, which ‚Äì most importantly of all ‚Äì will all the
      while achieve the tightest possible adhesion to the only meaning
      of ‚Äúoriginal‚Äù with any significance or real world value at all,
      which serves human curiosity without punishing it in any sense. I

      cheesy, yes, and a bit cringey in the middle of just any old day

      all-caps, in the footer of our CMS, and ‚Äì I‚Äôll be honest ‚Äì I don‚Äôt
      know if I could explain it over coffee to a stranger without
      turning red and covering my face, as I once could, but it‚Äôs
      (sincerely, in this one Ôªøcase) real gravestone material. (As in,
      if someone were to read this after my death, they would be
      encouraged to receive it as a bonafide last wish.)

      If you‚Äôve ever thought to yourself <emphasis>wow, Bandcamp has
      looked basically the same forever</emphasis>, you were entirely
      correct ‚Äì now for a tenth of the century, at least ‚Äì and you‚Äôll be
      hard-pressed to find another Silicon Valley technology company
      toting a venture-funded origin story with such casual, yet robust
      long-standing user relationships underneath an unwavering,
      bullshit-free commitment to their product. Even under the most
      ludicrous scrutiny, the company‚Äôs rudder is flawless and its
      course true. What at first glance you‚Äôd swear to be an unsolicited
      conclusion to an obscure examination could very reasonably be
      described as <emphasis>cheesy</emphasis>,
      <emphasis>stubborn</emphasis>, <emphasis>dweebish</emphasis>,
      <emphasis>pious</emphasis>, or just generally
      <emphasis>boring</emphasis>, indeed, yet the respective accuracy
      of each of these adjectives are no more than the byproducts of the
      very same operational ethics which we‚Äôve suggested, requested,
      demanded, and begged the rest of the world‚Äôs computing capitol to
      re-adopt, enforce, or at least <emphasis>ponder</emphasis> for a
      beat. The volume of the masses‚Äô exponentially-increasing
      attendance of late is only overcome by its hysterical shouting
      match, so let us pipe down for a while, now so that we may be
      precise as we dig deeper into the methodology which has finally
      led to a profitable, drama-free outlying technology organization
      without the need for a single drop of analogous sweat over its
      brand upkeep. By arranging the company in its infancy to so
      precisely and elementally align with the needs of its customers,
      the original troupe of Bandcamp Bums ensured profound and lasting
      simplicity in the single overarching priority for those in every

      on independent music, and its viability as an alternative

      cynicism directed its way by the titans of the tech and music
      press. Over the course of this super link-laden journey, we‚Äôd
      consider the alarmingly hypocritical possibility that it‚Äôs been
      overlooked by mainstream conversations only because it has so long
      operated in the precise manner we claim is so hopelessly absent

      In fact, just about everything from the shrewd idealism of those

      inert figureheads. As their personalities have stolen the story,
      the people in industry with their hands on real product have all

      remaining at the End User‚Äôs eye level was abandoned by aspiration

      Though Bandcamp was technically the first comprehensive
      library-modeled music streaming service in existence, the topical
      conversations between both technology and music journalists and
      industry executives flooding both podcast and news feeds at the
      moment orbiting the ‚ÄúCord-Cutting‚Äù phenomena as it‚Äôs washed over
      television, cinema, and music are rooted in the same building
      blocks as the core technology behind the delivery of all of these
      conversations as well as their subjects, funny enough. As long as
      my subgeneration has known it, The Web has been a source of sound
      in some manifestation, but the example with the most perplexing
      history was also the first. Today, one of five tabs in the main
      menu of my iPhone‚Äôs native music app contains the text ‚ÄúRadio‚Äù
      beneath an ‚Äúantenna with waves‚Äù graphic which opens a service once
      called
      <link xlink:href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150608143103/https:/www.apple.com/itunes/itunes-radio/">iTunes

      However, both ‚ÄúiTunes Radio‚Äù and ‚ÄúApple Music Radio(?)‚Äù ‚Äì along
      with any and all audio streaming services (mentioned and not) ‚Äì
      are fundamentally nothing more than different UX design
      interpretations of the ‚Äúsimple‚Äù practice of streaming an audio
      file, which made its debut at the turn of the century in the form
      of ‚ÄúInternet Radio.‚Äù Astonishingly, the protocol ‚Äì still referred
      to by at least one person on Earth as ‚ÄúWebcasting,‚Äù no doubt ‚Äì has
      survived nearly 20 years, and even the youngest of us have likely
      encountered it in unusual situations.

      Ironically, the

      Internet Radio broadcasts remaining on the air are nothing more

      already this deep into internet history ‚Äì a distinction must be
      established between streaming static files and streaming live
      audio. The first relies on pre-recorded audio files uploaded to a
      publicly-accessible server ‚Äì in Kern‚Äôs original case, ‚Äúvia
      anonymous FTP and the Internet Gopher protocol,‚Äù which continues
      to be the elemental process behind every audio file streamed

      the same is true for all but the most laggard laggards. For as
      long as I‚Äôve been coherent enough to disseminate between much of
      anything, very few of its visible offerings have offered anything
      groundbreaking or fresh, perhaps out of negligence (one can very
      easily arrange leave a machine running SHOUTcast to shuffle
      through a given library of music and/or podcasts indefinitely,)
      frustration, or economic necessity.

      Crucially, the truly <emphasis>most</emphasis> critical
      consequences and contributions provided by the pioneers of
      Internet Radio to our current digital streaming experience were
      centered within intellectual property legislation and
      advertising-supported business. Unfortunately, this juncture marks
      our complete departure from my wheelhouse, but thankfully, a few
      sacred accounts of one of technology‚Äôs foremost confusing clashes
      with the ill-equipped, technoilliterate monoliths of the American
      justice system do indeed remain. As early as 2002, the ineffable

      would hope my comprehension is sufficient to declare that
      <emphasis>this was no Cambridge Analytica</emphasis>: only a few
      years subsequent the technology‚Äôs inception, operators within the
      Internet Radio business faced serious and immediate fines for

        Unlike the commercial radio stations we hear on the
        old-fashioned airwaves, Internet radio stations' primary market
        relationship isn't with advertisers; it's with listeners. In
        many cases, the listeners are the primary source of revenue.
        This business model is similar to that of noncommercial (public)
        radio, only the market relationship is much more direct and
        efficient. Internet radio stations don't need to stop
        programming to hold marathon whine-fests begging listeners to
        call phone volunteers and pledge money to qualify for a mug or a
        t-shirt. Listeners simply click on a PayPal or an Amazon link,
        and after a few more clicks they've made a payment.

      The launch garnered very little attention from tech or music
      publications of the time, but
      <link xlink:href="https://waxy.org/2008/09/bandcamp_launch/">Andy
      Baio‚Äôs interview with Diamond</link> provides a substantial,
      technically in-depth picture of just how revolutionary and
      necessary it was. Most of what has continued to make Bandcamp such
      an essential tool was present at the very beginning: server-side
      stats and metadata (a unique architectural undertaking, no doubt,)
      track and album-oriented pagination, and a robust, easily-embedded
      Flash player.

      SoundCloud</link> from the period and you‚Äôll notice just how much
      more functional, future-proofed and <emphasis>dignified</emphasis>
      Bandcamp appeared in comparison. As apprehensive as I am to be
      caught arguing for minimalism over good design, it‚Äôs made perfect
      sense in the use case of <emphasis>this one platform</emphasis>,
      which knew <emphasis>exactly</emphasis> what it was from birth,
      along with what it would <emphasis>always</emphasis> be,
      apparently, which is such a bizarre reversal of the archetypes and
      the relentless common narrative we know from The Valley‚Äôs legends.
      Ethan first shows the consumer‚Äôs experience ‚Äì none of which has
      changed after a whole decade aside from quality-specific track
      purchases ‚Äì before delving into the artist-side UI, beginning with
      the statistics tool, which included playback and search insights
      to a depth that was (and still is) unheard of from a free service.
      Then, he demonstrates the publishing process from upload to
      playback: adding album art, setting a release date, and pricing
      its purchase. Aside from their removal of the old waveform
      visualizer (I couldn‚Äôt find any record of an announcement of this
      decision, official or otherwise,) Bandcamp has changed absolutely
      <emphasis>nothing</emphasis> of what‚Äôs shown in Diamond‚Äôs
      tutorial. In the next few months, they would add
      <link xlink:href="https://daily.bandcamp.com/2008/11/26/design-customization/">custom

      <link xlink:href="https://venturebeat.com/2008/10/22/facebook-music-is-getting-its-act-together/">Facebook

      Contextually, it‚Äôs also important that we dwell for a moment on
      the legal and financial hullabaloo surrounding music sales during
      Bandcamp‚Äôs first formative years, and the federal government‚Äôs
      losing battle to interpret, enforce, or replace intellectual
      property law for the information age. As the Web had grown
      exponentially more capable and accessible as a means of audio file
      distribution, it had become absolutely saturated with blatantly
      DRM-circumventing .mp3s and .wavs. For years, the quickest way to
      follow up on a <emphasis>check it out</emphasis> sort of music
      recommendation was simply to search Google for its track name
      followed by ‚Äú.mp3.‚Äù If the first go didn‚Äôt yield success, even the
      most rudimentary application of cryptography ‚Äì like substituting
      some variation of ‚Äúnsilmtic.rar‚Äù to find a download for Nas‚Äô
      <emphasis>Illmatic</emphasis>, for instance ‚Äì was a sure bet for
      one‚Äôs second try, which would often return several copies just
      laying around Google-indexed WordPress media libraries, though
      results hosted on Mediafire were a preferable alternative. This
      was the establishment into which my first adolescent digital music
      discoveries were borned, and I‚Äôm still convinced that 99% of us
      participants were completely without malice. I‚Äôd argue heartily
      that music‚Äôs brief escape from the tireless grip of the record
      industry as its only medium stumbled into digital form would be
      clearly shown to have a net gain for the whole of American
      recording artists if you could measure and plot it, including the
      past, present, and future use of peer-to-peer sharing.

    <para>
      2010 would prove to be The Year of Reckoning for the fraction of
      DRM-violating traffic on the <emphasis>visible</emphasis> Web, at
      least. Though it‚Äôd be virtually impossible to quantify, is it only
      reasonable to assume that many siteowners made some real money
      from the ad impressions that directly resulted from their
      unauthorized hosting and Mediafire-embedding, but let‚Äôs consider
      how minuscule even the most outrageously liberal overestimate
      would be, side-by-side with the billions in additional revenue
      YouTube has raked in from the same music since assuming their
      place as the de facto platform for quickly summoning just about
      any work of audio that‚Äôs ever taken digital form. It was in
      February of that year that Blogger (another Google property)
      <link xlink:href="https://blogger.googleblog.com/2010/02/quick-note-about-music-blog-removals.html">deleted
      six music blogs</link> from its platform in response to complaints

      Copyright Act, itself.

    <para>
      ‚ÄúIt would seem the music bloggers aren't versed in the ways of
      DMCA claims and counterclaims. But you can't blame Google for
      that,‚Äù they concluded, after one of the blog‚Äôs founders expressed
      some of the most personally-dramatic words mine empathy has yet
      faced as

    <para>
      In hindsight, ‚Äúblame‚Äù is an even more useless avenue of one‚Äôs
      attention than usual, especially when one party (Google) was 100%
      exempt from any consequences all along. The alarming takeaway is
      not the DMCA‚Äôs deftness, but that <emphasis role="strong">Google
      had the freedom to wait for a parallel business incentive before
      deciding the law applied to them</emphasis>.
    </para>
    <para>
      Frankly, we should all have realized long ago just how fucking
      futile it is to attempt to control any file traffic. Every
      desktop-class browser ships with the capability to capture any
      streamable media on the Web with a handful of keystrokes ‚Äì it‚Äôd
      take a maximum of 20 minutes to bestow upon even the most casual
      user the knowledge they‚Äôd need to keep every single track, YouTube
      video, and Twitch stream they‚Äôd ever watch, 100% legally without a
      single third-party service/extension interaction, but the crucial
      question remains to what end, exactly? It‚Äôs easy, but it‚Äôs not
      exactly a fun way to spend an afternoon. The only two rationales
      that‚Äôd justify capturing streamed Web files at scale are 1) the
      totally bonkers inclination that any given property/ies is likely
      to disappear from the entire World Wide Web, ever or 2) the
      increasingly rarefying expectation of prolonged time away from
      internet access.

      As Bandcamp has stood so obdurately still, the mainstream music
      streaming sphere has expanded titanically around it as if
      enveloping the Indie platform in a surrealist timelapse within the

      expand the market into a ghoulish, filthy monstrosity beyond

      of digital music which a listener can browse, download locally, or
      stream from using Web browser or the mobile applications offered
      by each, respectively‚Äîand they can do from just about anywhere,
      for as much or as little as they wish. And‚Äîas the music industry
      and its satellites shall always remain for the rest of humanity‚Äôs
      reign‚Äîboth are overwhelmingly associated with young people. There,
      the crucial divide should probably ring a bell‚Äîit‚Äôs been a
      constant between cultural generations for as long as culture,
      itself has existed.

      There are those among us who‚Äôs adolescent adoration of music is
      still completely valid as a very powerful component of hormonal
      development, yet doomed to quickly sizzle into casual listening or
      worse by the time our post-secondary Senior year rolls around. And
      then, there are those on whom the curiosity clings devotedly on:
      the cool high school punk band-forming types our culture loves to
      romanticize, who‚Äôll inevitably end up bald and bespeckled with a
      pre-dawn community radio block. These Musicians, Crate-Diggers,
      and capital-A Audiophiles have historically overlapped in
      synonymous functions across a love triangle of dweebish
      intolerability, though it‚Äôs become especially easy as of late to
      forget that DIY recording is by no means a recent development‚Äîits
      financial and technical barrier-to-entry has simply plummeted
      thanks to the developmental progression of Digital Audio
      Workstations and a growing industry of consumer-oriented audio
      equipment. For succinct insight into this dynamic, let‚Äôs refer to
      the pre-dialogue context in

    <blockquote>
      <para>
        The only thing Page really wants to talk about [is] the sound of
        the music, and how that sound was achieved. He can talk about
        microphone placement for a very, very long time. Are you
        interested in having a detailed conversation about how the glue
        used with magnetic audiotape was altered in the late 1970s,
        subsequently leading to the disintegration of countless master
        tapes? If so, locate Jimmy Page. If a different musician
        obsessed over technological details with this level of exacting
        specificity, he would likely be classified as a ‚Äúnerd,‚Äù as that
        has become a strange kind of compliment in the Internet age.
        People actually want to be seen as nerds. But that designation
        does not apply here. Jimmy Page does not seem remotely nerdy.

      Bandcamp‚Äôs core architecture was handbuilt from the beginning to
      handle the ‚Äúhard part‚Äù for creators ‚Äúso that they didn‚Äôt have to
      be so nerdy,‚Äù which it, alone pioneered on the Web, becoming the
      best metadata management utility for all time, but also committing
      to a traditional interpretation of music mediums that can feel old
      fashioned in 2018. Despite having been around for a directly
      comparable length of time, SoundCloud has maintained its relevance
      among friends in my network as the more socially-focused platform
      for keeping up with work from their peers thanks in large part to
      its exclusive, timestamp-oriented comment function, which allows
      for ultra-specific shortform feedback between fellow creators and
      fans. This is how the company has chosen to grow its community,
      which has lent especially to its strength in the most ‚Äúnerdy‚Äù
      independent scenes: hip-hop and electronic music. The experience
      is busy by design and the divide between listener and creator is
      next to non-existent‚Äîby now, the difference is universally
      irrelevant. External sharing has also become a major strength
      since the inception of SoundCloud‚Äôs Web audio player, which was
      unlike any other embeddable we‚Äôd ever seen at the time. Over the
      years, it‚Äôs become the most universally-supported means of
      embedding a track or playlist elsewhere, though the space has
      quite recently began blooming with a few much slimmer Open Web
      offshoots like Vocaroo, Clyp, and Instaudio.

      While I can casually throw these names around for you in the same

      entire Forbes piece it would require to comprehensively
      demonstrate just how cavernous of a disparity canyon the industry
      represents. Early projects like Pandora were docile, ad-free, and

      <emphasis role="strong">music</emphasis> for

      before reiterating one of the several variations of Bandcamp‚Äôs
      founding premise that composes his core argument: ‚Äúif you actually
      care about music, and you care about the people who make it, and
      you want them to keep making it, the best way to do that is to buy
      directly from them, or to use services that allow you to directly

      Instead of the ‚Äúfirehose‚Äù-like experience of a contemporary
      activity feed, ‚Äúyou‚Äôve got a collection of albums and tracks that
      people were passionate enough to spend money on.‚Äù For my personal
      use, Ethan lit up a long-dormant incandescent bulb in my skull. My
      use of Bandcamp had long been to purchase and download music
      files, only‚Äînever to stream it‚Äîand there‚Äôs been good reason for
      this. While Bandcamp has formally supported playback on iPhone and
      iPad in-browser since
      <link xlink:href="https://daily.bandcamp.com/2010/07/14/now-streaming-on-the-ipad-iphone/">July
      2010</link>, actually using it for any substantial amount of
      playback has always been a souring endeavor. Considering that it‚Äôs
      persisted <emphasis>to this day</emphasis>, we must concede that
      it is part of an intentional design rather than just an irritating
      flaw: <emphasis role="strong">multitasking between apps or even
      browser tabs will prevent continuous playback of an
      album</emphasis>, as will locking the device. In order to move
      from track to track fluidly, one must keep the page with the
      in-use Bandcamp player front and center. For three years, this was
      the only way to stream Bandcamp on mobile, but such capability was
      far from reliably expected by even the earliest adopters, then‚Äî3G
      data networks were worse than you remember, anyway‚Äîand then in
      2013,
      <link xlink:href="https://daily.bandcamp.com/2013/10/25/its-over/">the
      Bandcamp app was launched</link> on iOS and Android, providing a
      sufficient fix in my book at the time. (I‚Äôd rather any
      externally-embedded players I may engage with in an album review
      or artist profile be limited to a single track, anyway.) However,
      the app itself remained quite mediocre for years, which was a
      tangible disappointment given how revolutionary their desktop
      experience had been when the company launched,but not necessarily
      a substantial deterrent to the sort of user they were attracting.

      I made a point to spend <emphasis>a lot</emphasis> of time
      engaging with Bandcamp‚Äôs service as much as possible ‚Äì naturally,
      this included a trip back through
      <link xlink:href="http://bandcamp.com/davidblue">my neglected,
      digitally dusty Collection</link>, which proved a way more
      emotionally provocative experience than I anticipated. Ethan‚Äôs
      simple truth didn‚Äôt really sink in until I realized that this list

      powerful‚Äînot something I could engage with for any extended time

      my upcoming special celebratory episode of
      <link xlink:href="http://extratone.com/radio">Extratone

      It hadn‚Äôt occurred to me that I would retain ownership and

      sum, as I did for at least half of the works you see‚Äîeven after an

    <para>
      Pursuing an objective definition of ‚Äúmusic Discovery‚Äù might appear
      foolish ‚Äì an individual‚Äôs music taste is perhaps the most broadly
      angst-steeped realms of overwhelming subjectivity in modern
      American culture, after all ‚Äì but its the pungent poignancy of our
      fundamental human relationship with sound, itself which makes the
      history of Discovery‚Äôs digitization so important (and
      fascinating.) If I were to ask you what you believe should be the
      single most important function that must be reliably performed by
      any ‚Äúmusic Discovery‚Äù device ‚Äì whether it be an application, Web
      service, magazine or even a crate-digging habit ‚Äì the single
      factor which would render whole vague concept inert, irrelevant,
      and/or completely destroyed, how would you answer? How would you
      interpret the question?
    </para>
    <para>
      It‚Äôs important we do well to take a considerable moment to
      cultivate a special wariness of the eggshells beneath our feet in
      this arena. Debatably at least a minim more than one‚Äôs taste in
      film, Americans from Generation X on forward until the end of time
      (I suspect) will hold ‚Äútheir‚Äù music as perhaps the most integral
      support upon which their identities are built throughout every
      stage of their lives. The intense sensation of ownership that
      propels this phenomenon within our culture leaves an especially
      sensitive passage ahead of us.

      As a wide-eyed teenager and infantile audio producer, I explored
      the idea of anti-music in my own entirely Bandcamp-supported
      project while I searched ‚Äì aided tremendously by my expert best
      friend ‚Äì for the edgiest, least sensical sounds and scenes on
      which to publicly attach on my identity in an opposing of
      ‚ÄúDiscovery‚Äôs‚Äù extremes with fandom: <emphasis role="strong">an
      obsessive, entirely-detached last-ditch skirmish between the
      cultural reality and my delusional pubescent need to be
      unique</emphasis>. This process appears to be a universal
      requisite in modern youth in one form or another, but it‚Äôs
      important now that I emphasize this confession: I was an
      especially ostentatious little backpacker fuck, but I‚Äôve continued
      to find my shame well worth achieving a specific balance for
      music‚Äôs purpose in my life, and I‚Äôd anecdotally endorse its
      potential to relieve cognitive dissonance at great scale. There‚Äôs
      only so much fun to be had blasting breakcore cassettes at
      deafening, distorted volumes solely to bewilder rural overnight
      convenience store clerks on their smoke breaks in the wee hours or
      the bruteforce seizure of the speakers‚Äô Bluetooth connection at a
      frat party just to play harsh noise or anime-sampling Hardstyle
      while demonically shrieking ‚Äì eyes rolled back ‚Äì and lighting
      various parts of oneself ablaze before one realizes that 1) it‚Äôs
      they who end up looking like the idiots for aggressively breaching
      a group‚Äôs fun with inappropriate tunes (yes, no matter how
      interesting, rare, or underrated they may be, Chadley;) 2) by
      ferally manifesting, you‚Äôve deligitimized yourself, which 3) can
      seriously damage any future attempts to accomplish
      <emphasis role="strong">the fundamental drive to share the gospel

      The real, sweetest truth is that <emphasis role="strong">100% of
      all music has value potential</emphasis> because of the medium‚Äôs
      broad influence on the human psyche. Pop music is amazing right
      now; the signature trap sound we devalued with Datpiff jokes made
      us all look like fools when it unconsciously transcended our
      ‚Äúirony‚Äù and burrowed its own huge partition in our sincere hearts.
      After my pitiful attempt to reject and distance myself from my own
      rural roots by scoffing at country music for years, I‚Äôve made a
      beautiful peace with the childhood memories and the historic
      excellence of Shania Twain and The Dixie Chicks in their mastery
      of both wholesome joy and crippling nostalgia (I‚Äôve even cried to
      Taylor Swift.) Yes, it‚Äôs been entirely reasonable all along to
      enjoy the straightforwardly slothen pleasure in belching ‚ÄúSweet
      Home Alabama‚Äù pounding cheap pissbeer on a foul pontoon boat on
      the Lake of the Ozarks, leaving my penultimate irony to confess
      that I‚Äôve only found true and serene identity through music after

      That said, it‚Äôs still bewildering how content we are to abruptly
      abandon the substance music had to our teenage selves out of
      misconstrued justifications for our classic fain√©ance ‚Äì actively
      choosing to subject our public ambiance to thousands of replays of
      ‚Äúthe best‚Äù records in favor of dipping even the most cowardly toe
      into unfamiliar waters, even when the opportunity cost is
      inherently halved ‚Äì only to then have the audacity to evangelize
      our dilapidated conceptions of ‚Äúgood music‚Äù to our children as we
      demonize the music of their generation, depriving them of a very
      essential rite of their cognitive development.
      <emphasis role="strong">I can think of little more reductive,
      repugnant, reckless, or racist crusades as a model figure than
      indoctrinating your child with an inherent distaste for their own
      culture</emphasis>, and nothing more deeply alarming to hear from
      the mouth of someone born in the 21st century than shit like
      ‚ÄúQueen was better than any rapper will ever be,‚Äù or ‚Äúreal
      musicianship will die forever with Eric Clapton.‚Äù It‚Äôs unfair and
      unnatural: imagine if your high school classmates had consistently
      turned up their scrunched nose at the living whole of rock &amp;
      roll, declaring Scott Joplin to be the last musician they could
      stand.

      Consider if the industry-wide customer experience standard for the
      musical ambiance in 1970s American eating and drinking
      establishments was entirely comprised of works by John Phillip
      Souza, and the most prevalent cultural revolution manifested
      itself something like the following: In countless popular films
      set in the time (and the stories told today by your parents of
      their youths that informs them,) a group of popular high school
      boys ‚Äì generally three longtime childhood friends and a single
      addition from the previous summer with an Army Dad and a moderate
      bad boy aura that‚Äôs made him one of the school‚Äôs notoriously
      attractive students and the somewhat-abusive leader in the pack.
      After spending some time trying to convince the other three (the
      crucial moment for his case being the bad kid‚Äôs rare moment of
      sincerity trope) of its guaranteed social, sexual and financial
      ROI, they seal their agreement to start a band with a four-way
      saliva slap. Imagine if in the progression of this exhausted old
      tale, it remained entirely classic (and boring) when it faded to a
      ‚ÄúTHREE MONTHS LATER...‚Äù ceiling shot of the four the in full,
      gleaming, performance-spec get-up of the presidential marching
      band in their garage, and it was revealed that they‚Äôd they
      practiced ‚ÄúThe Star Spangled Banner‚Äù every night just to make the

      conservatively) dripping down from the overhead speakers in all
      manner of big retail stores, where it‚Äôs inappropriate and
      unwelcome. Even from the generous assumption that every single one
      of them is an objective masterwork of composition, the amount of
      affection the American music listening audience has for the same
      500 singles is on par with our rampant gun violence in terms of
      our unanimous tolerance for ridiculously illogical habits. I‚Äôve
      been sitting in a cute, moderately trendy coffee shop on the
      corner of the major avenue of access to my cute, moderately trendy
      Portland neighborhood for an hour now, and I‚Äôve recognized every
      single one of the tracks played just a bit too loudly on the

      To fill in the parking lot party blank with a single streaming
      solution for the sake of our young, art school-attending, likely
      more musically-literate than average summer barbecue guests‚Äîhow
      viable is Bandcamp? Truthfully, it‚Äôs only slightly more suited now
      than it was in its earliest infancy for obediently filling a space
      with ambiance. We could ponder whether or not its design
      discourages absentminded playback only consequently, or perhaps
      condescendingly from the high, white tower of hipster elitism on
      which you‚Äôll occasionally hear it accused of perching, but UX
      design is <emphasis>the</emphasis> most ridiculous sphere within

      SoundCloud would be a bit closer to the mark‚Äîit can be configured

      (excluding the embedded player, of course)‚Äîbut it‚Äôd be much safer
      to spend the smidgen of extra time required to find a manmade
      playlist. Letting it loose will quickly land you on some seriously
      dubious (and probably embarrassing) nerd shit. As I understand it,
      YouTube has long been the go-to houseparty music player because of
      its universality, Chromecast support, and (obviously) visual
      component for accompanying music videos, so its new, ad-free
      <link xlink:href="https://djmag.com/content/youtube-launches-youtube-music-and-youtube-premium-streaming-services">YouTube

      Startlingly, the Web‚Äôs given best answer to this situation is
      still Spotify in all of its culture-diluting gluttony.
      <emphasis>Internet radio</emphasis>? Yikes. You can still find a
      gem of a stream every once in a while, but they‚Äôre usually
      unreliable and probably abandoned, so the catalog won‚Äôt last you
      more than a few hours before you‚Äôll start to hear repeats. You
      could search out the internet stream of your favorite radio
      station‚Äîa <emphasis>student</emphasis> radio station, even‚Äîbut
      those offering the most entertaining programming are unlikely to
      have a suitable playlist on a summer afternoon. So‚Äîforgetting its
      overwhelming financial funneling toward its top 10% and everything
      else for a moment‚Äîwhy not just give up the pretense and use
      Spotify? Again, for most of my friends, it works just fine to play
      Cat Stevens, Run DMC, Gorillaz or The Rolling Stones, but I have
      yet to figure out a combination of keywords to keep it on target
      within even the most rudimentary parameters. Such ill-restraint
      becomes especially dire‚Äînecessary, really‚Äîwhen I queue up
      ‚ÄúCannibal Ox Radio‚Äù for the office and R Kelly ends up playing, 20
      minutes in. Using personally-targeted artist bans is probably too
      subjective to ask of such a service in the spotlight, but
      <emphasis role="strong">how about an option to filter out white

      The truth is, I‚Äôd probably end up calling upon Apple Music as I‚Äôve
      been an on-and-off subscriber since its release, but have yet to
      meet a single fellow user. The girth of its catalog is
      <link xlink:href="https://9to5mac.com/2018/05/06/apple-music-vs-spotify/">reportedly
      still nearly</link>
      <link xlink:href="https://9to5mac.com/2018/05/06/apple-music-vs-spotify/">25%
      larger</link>, its UI is significantly more cohesively integrated
      with iOS (which hasn‚Äôt always been a given from Apple with its
      music software, mind you,) yet it costs me precisely the same
      $9.99 a month as Spotify Premium would. If I
      <emphasis>did</emphasis> know somebody else who used it, they‚Äôd be
      able to see <link xlink:href="http://bit.ly/dbapple">my public
      profile</link> including my playlists and activity, just as my
      followers on Spotify can, and I can create ‚ÄúStations‚Äù for artists
      that function similarly to Spotify‚Äôs endless adaptive playlists,
      but‚Äîcrucially, for myself‚Äîafter the app‚Äôs redesign for iOS 10, the
      integration of Apple Music music with my own iTunes library is
      completely seamless. With unlimited data, I‚Äôve selected the option
      to refrain from storing music locally, which further diminishes
      the distinction between ‚Äúmy‚Äù music and the music I‚Äôve paid for the
      rights to stream. Fundamentally, the end result is that I pay ten

      for any boomer you know with that classically impenetrable disgust
      for <emphasis>all</emphasis> electronic music, and you‚Äôll witness
      firsthand how special yzome‚Äôs particular innovation truly is. No,
      they‚Äôre not going to be <emphasis>sexually liberated</emphasis>,
      or anything‚Äîit‚Äôs still going to be alarming‚Äîbut you‚Äôll notice that
      the swift and overwhelming fury which sample and break-heavy dance
      music has always awoken within them has been miraculously
      circumvented. Instead of immediately storming off, they‚Äôll be
      paralyzed in an existential fugue state from which they may never
      quite fully emerge. I‚Äôve seen it firsthand. It‚Äôs witchcraft.

      There is no other across the (especially-wide) electronic spectrum
      who can so loudly go so far, so fast without any insincerity,
      whatsoever. His arrangement seems mischievous and all over the
      place, but really listen and you‚Äôll hear rips of recognizable
      patterns playing peekaboo in willy-nilly bursts that reveal his
      dynamic mastery of the dance music space through Breakcore, Juke,
      Footwork, and Techno sampling. All of this is to say, really, that
      yzome‚Äôs music represents a level of boundary-pushing which only a
      niche audience tends to truly appreciate, yet is undoubtedly
      worthy of an elegantly-presented host like Bandcamp.

      The truth is, the continued obscurity of Bandcamp‚Äôs story despite
      all it‚Äôs done comes down not to any malpractice by the company (in
      fact, it would likely be more visible had it fucked up more,) or
      even to its prevalence in the careers of big industry names (whom
      I will address in detail shortly,) but because it simply operates
      too magnanimously for its customers to be taken seriously as a
      newsworthy business, which is problematic and personally
      infuriating. In November, 2015, Bandcamp made mention in
      <emphasis>The New Yorker</emphasis> via the openly diminutive
      context of <emphasis>Car Seat Headrest‚Äôs</emphasis>
      <link xlink:href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/02/growth-spurt-pop-music-hua-hsu">origin
      story</link>, describing it as ‚Äúa charming alternative,‚Äù and ‚Äúa
      casual, low-risk approach.‚Äù Granted, it‚Äôs worth noting that the
      platform did not address its lack of ‚Äúeditorial guidance‚Äù until a
      year later, with the
      <link xlink:href="https://daily.bandcamp.com/2016/06/13/welcome-to-bandcamp-daily/">launch</link>
      of the excellent <emphasis>Bandcamp Daily</emphasis> blog, but I
      think you‚Äôll agree it‚Äôs in poor taste to argue against the
      legitimacy of a <emphasis>music</emphasis> distribution platform
      because it‚Äôs <emphasis>too democratic.</emphasis> Perhaps it‚Äôs
      still just beyond reasonable expectations to get a
      top-of-the-foodchain music writer‚Äôs head wrapped around the idea
      that such products on The Internet can easily‚Äîeven

      The two services were launched the same year‚Äîthat fateful 2008‚Äîbut
      comparing them is complicated. They are clear opposites in at
      least one principal: how they‚Äôve defined their mission. Bandcamp
      has changed less throughout its history than any other Web service
      that comes to mind (see below,) but SoundCloud has struggled with
      identity issues, to their vastly-superior success (in terms of
      user statistics, anyway.) <emphasis>The New York Times</emphasis>
      <link xlink:href="https://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/06/15/soundcloud-an-audio-sharing-site-hits-5-million-users/">reported
      in June, 2011</link> that they‚Äôd reached 5 million users, citing
      their decision to expand focus beyond ‚Äúpopular music‚Äù to explain
      the milestone. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre building a sound platform that‚Äôs not just
      about music,‚Äù said Alex Ljung ‚Äì a SoundCloud co-founder and the
      company‚Äôs chief executive at the time ‚Äì and its present landscape
      certainly reflects a diverse offering of uses, but ultimately, any
      . Today, both SoundCloud and Bandcamp have premium subscription
      plans for artists which are at least
      <emphasis>perceived</emphasis> to be competitive with one
      another‚Äî<link xlink:href="https://blog.soundcloud.com/2013/03/11/introducing-soundcloud-pro/">SoundCloud
      Pro</link> and
      <link xlink:href="https://daily.bandcamp.com/2012/06/25/new-features-up/">Bandcamp
      Pro</link>, respectively‚Äîalong with free base experiences, which
      we‚Äôll compare first.
    </para>
    <para>
      <emphasis role="strong">Free Bandcamp Account Uploads</emphasis>:
      quantity unlimited, size of each file limited to 291mb.
      <emphasis role="strong">Distribution</emphasis>: unlimited
      streaming, up to 200 free downloads per month.
    </para>
    <para>
      <emphasis role="strong">Free SoundCloud Account
      Uploads</emphasis>: total of 3 hours uploaded at any given time.
      <emphasis role="strong">Distribution</emphasis>: unlimited
      streaming, unlimited downloads.
    </para>
    <para>
      Both offer access ‚Äúbasic‚Äù statistics for their tracks at this tier
      which most of the creators I know consider more than enough‚Äîthe
      usefulness of any playback/download stats is negligible when
      you‚Äôre publishing within tight niches‚Äîand each has had about 5
      years to fine-tune their free offerings so that they feel as
      complete as possible. If you‚Äôre planning on publishing a podcast
      on SoundCloud, you‚Äôre obviously going to have to upgrade your
      upload limit even beyond Pro ($8/month, 6-hour upload limit) to
      Pro Unlimited ($16/month, unlimited uploads,) though I would
      suggest a plethora of alternative methods before you got that far.
      Unfortunately, they would not include a free Bandcamp account.
      While

      aspirations and without support for the basic requirements of
      podcast distribution (namely, RSS feeds.)
    </para>
    <para>
      Bandcamp‚Äôs Pro option is $10 a month and includes a custom domain,
      batch file uploading, private streaming (for press and/or fans)
      plus the ability to disable <emphasis>free</emphasis> streaming
      (requiring listeners to actually buy the music to enable any
      playback,) ad-free video hosting (which nobody uses, to my
      knowledge,) extended fan interaction tools, and a broader
      statistics suite that includes Google Analytics support.
      SoundCloud‚Äôs Pro and Pro Unlimited options are complimentary, but
      a full-time independent artist could justify maintaining Pro
      accounts on both services or neither‚Äîone does not necessarily
      replace the other, but the contrast in their chosen presentations
      has led to a divide in the cultures of the two communities so
      stark
      <link xlink:href="http://www.thefader.com/2017/04/03/bandcamp-artists-vs-soundcloud-artists-meme">it
      could be a punchline</link> and/or simplified to say that

      is not</emphasis>.
    </para>
    <para>
      It‚Äôs not entirely shocking, then, that SoundCloud‚Äôs story has been
      more present in the greater conversation than Bandcamp‚Äôs. Frankly,
      its largest issues are directly related: compared to SoundCloud,
      <emphasis role="strong">Bandcamp‚Äôs community is White As
      Fuck</emphasis> (a claim I can only make on behalf of my own
      observations and those which a select few creators have seen fit
      to express to me over the years, considering that the company has
      yet to release any demographic information about its creators)
      which is a glaringly fundamental obstruction to the project‚Äôs
      broader mission to help music culture

      From a future historian‚Äôs perspective, the battle for the
      definitive name in independent digital music distribution has
      already won, largely thanks to its relationship with Chance The
      Rapper, who‚Äôs quickly become a ‚Äúcultural influencer, thought
      leader, global star,‚Äù and one of my generation‚Äôs upmost celebrity
      champions. Obviously, there is little sense trying to determine
      whether SoundCloud <emphasis>earned</emphasis> his partnership or
      landed their popular association with his name as long as the
      artist maintains it publicly, while continuing to
      <link xlink:href="https://soundcloud.com/pitchfork/pitchfork-presents-in-sight-out-chance-the-rapper">give
      new meaning</link> to the phrase ‚Äúserially likable.‚Äù Thus far, his
      mythical power to exude purity has felt virtually 100% airtight
      Last year, his second album <emphasis>Coloring Book</emphasis>
      made history when it won the

      <link xlink:href="https://youtu.be/FkAJ_BU66Zs">accepted the

      any moment, at least it‚Äôll have the distinct pride of doing so
      having maintained his publicly-expressed respect and confidence,
      which is a damned fine legacy in my book. Meanwhile, Bandcamp has
      only made a few small tweaks to its basic infrastructure, and
      added new features very deliberately, which haven‚Äôt resulted in a
      single memorable controversy. Aside from

      SmartSuite 9.8</link> and my head just shot right off.</emphasis>
    </para>
    <para>
      All of the programs in this release of Lotus SmartSuite meet Lotus
      guidelines for Year 2000 (Y2K) readiness. When used in accordance
      with its associated documentation, each of the SmartSuite programs
      is capable of correctly processing, providing and/or receiving
      date data within and between the 20th and 21st centuries, provided
      that all products (for example, hardware, software and firmware)
      used with the program properly exchange accurate date data with
      it.
    </para>
<literallayout><emphasis role="strong">A little background information</emphasis>
In the past, you have probably entered a 2-digit number to represent the year in a date with the assumption that the year would fall between 1900 and 1999. For example, 4/10/02 was in 1902 and 5/8/47 was in 1947.</literallayout>
    <para>
      With the change to the year 2000, you should be aware that
      computer programs may now interpret dates you enter with 2-digit
      years to be in the 20th or the 21st century depending on the
      method the program uses to define a 2-digit year.
    </para>
    <para>
      SmartSuite programs use a sliding (rolling) window method to
      determine the year when you enter only 2 digits to represent the
      year in a date.
    </para>

      <emphasis role="strong">Notes</emphasis>
    </para>
    <itemizedlist spacing="compact">
      <listitem>
        <para>
          You can enter the year as 4 digits to make sure you get the
          results you want. For example, enter 1916 or 2016 instead of
          16 for the year.
        </para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>
          Although you can change how a program displays a date by
          selecting different date formats, the program stores a
          constant value for the date no matter how you choose to
          display it.
        </para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
<literallayout><emphasis role="strong">What is the sliding window method?</emphasis>
In SmartSuite, the sliding window method defines a window of 100 years around the current year (determined by the system date on your computer). When you enter a 2-digit year, the program compares the 2 digits you entered with the years that fall within this 100 year window.
For example, entering 25 for the year might be interpreted as 1925 but 04 might mean the year 2004.</literallayout>
<literallayout>The years that mark the beginning and end of this window are defined by where the program splits the window with the current year.
By default, 1-2-3, Approach, Freelance Graphics, Organizer, and Word Pro use an 80/20 rule for this sliding window ‚Äî the window begins 80 years before and ends 19 years after the current year.</literallayout>
<literallayout><emphasis role="strong">How does the 80/20 rule work?</emphasis>
Suppose the current year is 1999. Using the 80/20 rule, a window spanning 100 years includes the years 1919 to 2018.</literallayout>
<literallayout>In 1999, any 2-digit year you enter from 19 to 99 will equal years from 1919 to 1999. Any 2-digit year you enter from 00 to 18 will equal years from 2000 to 2018. If you want to enter a date before 1919 or after 2018, you must enter 4 digits for the year.
For example, assume that the current year is 1999. ‚Ä¢ If you enter 4/2/19, the year will be 1919. ‚Ä¢ If you enter 4/2/72, the year will be 1972. ‚Ä¢ If you enter 4/2/00, the year will be 2000. ‚Ä¢ If you enter 4/2/17, the year will be 2017. ‚Ä¢ If you enter 4/2/1917, the year will be 1917. Every year this 100 year window moves (slides) forward one year. Under the 80/20 rule, when the year changes to 2000, the window will include the years 1920 to 2019. When the year changes to 2001, the window will include the years 1921 to 2020, and so on.</literallayout>
<literallayout><emphasis role="strong">How do you change the 80/20 default?</emphasis>
The 80/20 default for SmartSuite is set through a single entry in the Windows registry. You can change this registry entry using the sample scripts available on the Web (www.lotus.com/smartsuitedev) and in the \Extra directory on the CD version of Lotus SmartSuite.
<emphasis role="strong">Caution</emphasis> Changing the default changes it for all of the programs in SmartSuite.</literallayout>
<literallayout><emphasis role="strong">How do SmartSuite programs store dates?</emphasis>
All the SmartSuite programs store date values with the fully qualified year. Therefore, dates already stored in files are not affected by the sliding window. The sliding window is used to interpret a date when you enter it using 2 digits to represent the year.
<emphasis role="strong">Caution</emphasis> If years are stored as separate values in a file, and scripts or macros interpret these dates as they run, the sliding window rules will apply to those values when only 2 digits are stored for the year.</literallayout>
<literallayout><emphasis role="strong">For 1-2-3 users only</emphasis>
You can turn off the 80/20 sliding window in 1-2-3 by changing the date settings in the 1-2-3 Preferences dialog box. You can also display all dates with 4-digit years. For more information on 1-2-3 and the year 2000, open Help in 1-2-3 and search on Year 2000 in the Help Index.</literallayout>

      If you've ever found this industry's history intriguing, you've

      with¬†<emphasis>Halt and Catch Fire</emphasis>'s pilot release in
      2014, the broad-shouldered soldier of open computing appeared to
      have been on a mini media tour (even though he openly admitted
      he‚Äôd yet to actually watch it.) [His last remark ‚Äì ‚Äúmaybe even as
      exciting as the real thing‚Äù ‚Äì may sound like silly Dork Rod
      conjecture, but the show wasn‚Äôt nearly as engaging because they
      had(?) to remove the <emphasis>compatibility</emphasis> component,
      which is the meat of the whole thing.] McCullough is usually ace
      at this stuff, but he sounds a bit shaky in this one, though
      nobody should blame him ‚Äì I certainly would be, too. Rod Canion's
      accent (BIOS=<emphasis>buy-OSS</emphasis>) and general intensity

      Yesterday, I finished moving out of the situation I‚Äôd been living
      in for ~6 weeks in the basement of a southeast Portland home near
      the western base of Mt. Tabor. You'd see it just across from the
      flat Washington Mall-ish grass rectangle that provides daring
      suburban explorers their most worthwhile reward for reaching the
      top. It resembles one of many local residential templates which I
      was completely unequipped to understand when I arrived in the area
      last year. You'll never observe any of its inhabitants outside
      doing any of the things people do when they are unaware of ‚Äì or
      unconcerned with being observed. Walking by an afternoon front
      yard ‚Äúfamily gathering‚Äù (young white parents and their one or two
      children) is a prospect of haste. Introducing new movement to the
      vicinity after the sun has gone down stirs a disruption from deep
      within its energy. Everyone in this town is afraid. I say it‚Äôs an
      unnatural way to live, but I‚Äôm just a fucking bumpkin.

      As you may or may not have observed, the vast majority of my
      working being lives on the World Wide Web, which requires,
      fundamentally‚Ä¶. An internet connection. In most any other
      present-day first world circumstance, these are infinitely
      available, but I discovered ‚Äì after the moving process was
      entirely completed, of course ‚Äì that my tenants did
      <emphasis role="strong">not</emphasis> actually have an in-house
      connection of their own. They explained to me that their neighbor
      ‚Äì an ‚ÄúIT professional‚Äù for IBM ‚Äì had offered to let them use
      <emphasis>his</emphasis> WiFi network, and they‚Äôd found the
      arrangement sufficient. However, because IBM is
      <emphasis>The</emphasis> archaic marque of digital fascism
      (disclosure: they are also my
      <link xlink:href="http://bilge.world/compaq">sworn blood

      that his offer did not extend to ‚Äúguests.‚Äù

      I considered that a defined period of WiFi fasting at home could
      make for an interesting experiment ‚Äì perhaps even a needed mental
      reset ‚Äì and I couldn't reasonably afford to acquire my own
      dedicated 4G hotspot, anyway. The reality became a relentless
      paranoid battle for any trickle of access ‚Äì sometimes for
      <emphasis>a dozen bytes per second</emphasis>; for just the most
      basic digital communications like SMS and email ‚Äì which led to
      more superstitious hypotheses about precarious antenna
      orientation, progress bar hallucinations, out-of-control
      frustration, and hopeless fixation with refresh commands than I
      remember from 2nd generation cell networks in the Midwest, 10
      years ago, or even domestic dial-up, and truly revealed the extent
      to which I'd taken connectivity for granted.

      My observations of my own behavior throughout this drought are
      worth more than their mild amusement: even this petty disparity (I
      was never more than two or three yards from nearly-whole signal at
      the top of the outside stairs) re-sensitized my perspective to the
      abstract concept of network unreliability which I'd been entirely
      spared since prepubescence. Though 4 billion human beings now
      regularly interact with the World Wide Web, their connections span
      a mathematically gargantuan spectrum of speed and reliability. In
      urbanizing myself as an adult, I have unconsciously latched on to
      the entitled ideal that internet access is a public service and
      accepted dramatically-increasing dependence on services that
      engorge greater and greater volumes of bandwidth without any
      explanation but their lack of incentives for efficiency. I reflect
      on my relationship with technology every day, yet I still became
      an oblivious data glutton in mind-bogglingly little time.

        ‚Äì one of thousands of behaviors which were more abruptly and
        universally required for a few years and subsequently more
        abruptly forgotten than any other such united tick in American
        history. This blip of shared technological adversity also led to

        Directly above my head‚Äôs place on the bed, the phone could be

        make on the local end was to bring them near to each other as
        they paired. Afterwards, I could return the phone to its tin and
        work on the laptop from the kitchen table, 12-15 feet away.
        (Curiously enough, the 6930p itself shipped with hotspot

        Quantifying the speed of a mobile data connection as you would a
        dedicated WiFi network is incongruent because the former trades
        in a much less consistent packet stream. That‚Äôs the extent of my
        knowledge, but it‚Äôs easy to visualize: a signal that can travel
        a mile or two in big globules bound to be intercepted in
        splashes upon the device‚Äôs little antennae, versus your home
        network‚Äôs local, evenly distributed sauna of irradiated mist.
        It‚Äôs much less definite, to say the least, and I can‚Äôt actually
        comprehend the sort of voodoo that‚Äôs required in order to expand
        and maintain the networks as they are, nor would I ever wish to
        burden myself with such knowledge.

        Reflection upon just about anything can have personal meaning,
        but no amount of musicianship can mask a stark lack of context.
        I do wonder if Indie Folk should just return to the megachurch,
        where songwriters like Joe and musicians of his crew‚Äôs sort are
        literally <emphasis>handed</emphasis> a gigantic audience of
        trained experts at finding profound meaning where it probably
        isn‚Äôt, along with great salaries, from what I hear. Otherwise,
        all that taxing preparation and expenditure will only lead to
        more forgettable performances. Or perhaps I am simply misguided
        in my assumption that artists work exclusively to communicate
        <emphasis>something</emphasis> lasting to
        <emphasis>someone</emphasis>. Every conversation I‚Äôve had with

        After what felt like hours of drowsy corn cob pipes, Christmas
        sweaters, and old sweethearts at fifty beats per minute (there
        were literally two young men sleeping within 15 feet of the
        bands for the duration,) Ricky sat himself on a stool in the

        guitar and his voice. Unfortunately, I‚Äôd squandered the Nikon‚Äôs

        For years, I took the voices and culture of working Americans
        for granted and sought to generally distance myself from my
        origin‚Äôs heritage as much as possible, but I‚Äôve since realized
        that I couldn‚Äôt have done so without absolute certainty that
        country, bluegrass, and folk music were stubborn as State
        highway ditch-rooted fescue blades: omnipresent forces of
        Midwestern nature that‚Äôd secured their invincibility with the
        simple superiority of their belonging. While this conclusion is
        true enough for the time being, it‚Äôs quite independently so of
        their worth or necessity. In such conditional blindness, I‚Äôve
        simply proven my sensibilities to be (predictably in the case of
        my seniors) not exempt. This truth is noteworthy only because of
        its potential to spare others the embarrassment of blatant
        ignorance to their own privilege. That said, I would suggest
        that you engage this music sincerely for a moment for your own
        sake, regardless of your own convictions regarding country
        music, Indiana, plaid, pickup trucks, the end of the world, or

        As young adults, even those folks who‚Äôve remained resolutely
        country-minded found themselves trivializing the name of the
        titanic Dallas-born trio The Dixie Chicks not out of half-assed
        iconoclasm, but because their brand was so cleverly immune to
        irony. You thought you were proving yourself of a higher caliber
        of discernment, but mocking goddesses only paraded your
        ignorance. In my teen rebellion against the culture of my rural
        origin, I scoffed at their mention for a while, somehow
        oblivious to my blatant hypocrisy. Thanks to my older sisters
        and their automobiles, I spent before and after elementary
        school days absorbing thousands of hours‚Äô worth of
        late-90s/early-oughts Pop Country radio. Two summers ago, I
        returned to this library at length for the first time in 10
        years and found my heart completely vulnerable to its related
        memories and my mind consistently flabbergasted by the oomph of
        the composition that defines the genre‚Äôs last mainstream hurrah.

        From a pop perspective at least, The Dixie Chicks are almost
        certainly the penultimate expression of country music as a
        technical and emotional exercise. Their extraordinary
        musicianship and prodigally antecedent mastery of suave
        sincerity represented the absolute peak of pop country‚Äôs
        untenable relationship with the American working class in one
        hell of a 21st-century-breaching last hurrah that still brings
        tears of pride to many an eye. However, the hysterical backlash
        of the greater working people personified in part by Donald
        Trump‚Äôs presidency is a last sure indication of the mainstream‚Äôs
        final estrangement from all distillations of rural culture. In
        the coming years, I fear the toiling masses will be left only
        with less and less authentic, more and more suburban
        bastardizations of their music as the last superficial delusions
        of condescending affection from the middle class fade, and the
        enterprise dies. What does survive will ‚Äúgraduate‚Äù (retire) to
        Folk (for white performers,) and further strengthen the Blues
        resurrection (for everyone else.) That said, it‚Äôs hard to find
        anyone who‚Äôs comfortable mourning the loss openly after
        acceptance has progressively set in ‚Äì there‚Äôs simply nowhere
        else to go, and its aging icons have been in desperate need of
        retirement throughout the Information Age.

        Even if I‚Äôd had the moderate exposure from my current perch in
        the midst of the notoriously grass-roots nature of Portland‚Äôs
        Folk/Blues scene, 2000 miles west, I would have still been
        totally blindsided by my incidental introduction to The
        Matchsellers, two years ago. One needn‚Äôt harbor any presumptions
        about the relationship between Kansas City violinist/fiddler
        Julie Bates and Hoosier blues guitarist, Andrew Morris ‚Äì they‚Äôre
        just about the cutest pair you‚Äôll ever see, couple‚Äôs act or not
        (it‚Äôs less relevant than you‚Äôd think, and none of our business.)
        They‚Äôre also extremely talented and genuinely authoritative
        world-class musicians with plenty of authentic country mileage
        who exude a proud air of warm, confident serenity occupying the
        bluegrass sphere. After happening upon their set at Columbia‚Äôs
        faux-speakeasy in Summer 2016, I was at once charmed and
        impressed by the pervasive magnitude of the ethereal aura that
        followed them, especially after our brief post-performance
        conversation. I‚Äôm ninety percent sure they came without a mobile
        phone between them carrying a wicker basket full of CDs and
        matchbooks, and shucks‚Ä¶ I do believe we‚Äôve been doing this whole
        thing wrong, all along.

        As a displaced (and formerly ex-communicated) yokel, I‚Äôve often
        been astonished by how easy it is to discard American folk music
        for huge swaths of time unless it expresses some unignorable
        sort of spectacular torment. My own failure to recognize the
        value in this one until I became separated and homesick was an
        overtly foolhardy clich√© (though quite predictable of like
        privilege,) but I can‚Äôt help but wonder:
        <emphasis role="strong">is it unavoidable?</emphasis> Of course,
        the process is necessary for ‚Äòclass justice‚Äô ‚Äì one might even
        call it a natural law of sorts ‚Äì and in the case of The
        Matchsellers, there‚Äôs hardly a struggle to communicate
        emotionally. For a real music scholar, though, it‚Äôs surely worth
        asking of those voices who know: do the oppressed, destitute,
        and hope-impoverished people of this country still rely on
        bluegrass, or has it been replaced for them?

        despite the exponential increase of required reading in the

        For written American media, especially, one would assume that a
        financial and social incentive for maximum literacy in the
        populace should present a straightforward justification for
        intense widespread coverage of this particular disparity, yet
        most related coverage in mainstream national magazines and

        the end of 2019. Demographically, the magazine's readership is
        predominantly middle to upper-class, who are the least affected
        social groups by a significant margin as per illiteracy's strong

        designed to function as ‚Äúa school survival guide for parents
        (and everyone else), from education policy to psychology‚Äù ‚Äî
        which represents the most substantial discussion of American
        illiteracy in topical, widely-visible media (i.e. presence in a
        succinct search engine query.) She briefly introduces the issue
        with a bulleted list of illiteracy's consequences on modern
        society and the individual cited from a

        Johnson presents a passionate and well-informed exploration of
        the state of the literacy battle from the perspective of a
        full-time, locally on-the-ground advocate. Her op-ed's
        introduction includes the most essential observations and
        statistics throughout, noting ‚Äúthe children of parents with low
        literacy skills are more likely to live in poverty as adults and
        are five times more likely to drop out of school,‚Äù before
        setting upon a detailed examination of current and relevant
        organizations working toward <emphasis>solutions</emphasis>. Of
        course, it's largely centered upon her own organization, which
        she claims has ‚Äúhelped more than 6000 adults rebuild their
        education and job opportunities since 1985.‚Äù
      </para>
      <para>
        It's significant that an institution as deeply embedded across
        the American political spectrum as <emphasis>The Washington
        Post</emphasis> address the issue of American illiteracy, and
        both Johnson and Strauss are certainly qualified voices for the
        undertaking, but when we examine this particular article, it's
        important we consider the context of the <emphasis>Answer
        Sheet</emphasis> newsletter and its intended audience. Though
        it's no challenge to pitch the importance of reading and writing
        to parents and professional educators, the most alarming and
        destructive issue at hand is the educational disparity between
        <emphasis>their adult peers</emphasis>. ‚ÄúThere's a literacy
        problem in the capitol, but I'm not talking about young people
        who can't read. Many adults ‚Äî perhaps even parents sitting next
        to you at back to school night ‚Äî don't possess academic skills,‚Äù
        notes Johnson with her very first paragraph. However,
        considering the nature of parenthood, the audience primarily
        consuming these words are undoubtedly preoccupied with
        <emphasis>juvenile</emphasis> issues, specifically, and we can
        assume their capacity to empathize with their fellow working
        adults who could benefit from literacy education is actually
        <emphasis>lessened</emphasis> from that of childless readers of
        the same age as a result. ‚ÄúDespite the magnitude of the adult
        literacy crisis, most of those needing to make up lost ground
        are pushed toward traditional classroom settings‚Äîeven though
        many of these people can't possibly follow through because of
        cost or work schedules or other obstacles,‚Äù she attests.

        struggling with a serious illiteracy problem. According to
        <link xlink:href="https://www.wxyz.com/news/conquering-illiteracy-one-neighborhood-at-a-time-with-beyond-basics-program">a
        profile of the Beyond Basics program</link> (which was adapted
        from an embedded video broadcast) on their local ABC affiliate's
        website, forty-seven percent of adult Detroiters cannot read,
        but even companies like General Motors ‚Äî who donated \$250,000
        to the Beyond Basics program earlier in mid-October ‚Äî are
        getting involved. The article quotes Elijah Craft, a young man
        who was ‚Äúreading at a first-grade level as a senior at Detroit's
        Central High School.‚Äù ‚ÄúCraft would rare venture from home for
        fear he would get lost because he could not read street signs,‚Äù
        reports <emphasis>WXYZ</emphasis> anchor
        <link xlink:href="https://www.wxyz.com/about-us/staff/carolyn-clifford">Carolyn
        Clifford</link>. She frames the narrative around a reference to
        the 2009 film <emphasis>The Blind Side</emphasis> starring
        Sandra Bullock: ‚Äúhere, you might call this story 'The Detroit
        Side.'‚Äù For local television news, this reference to popular
        culture likely strengthened the story's power ensnare viewers'
        emotional attention when it was aired, and even in this written
        accompaniment, it proves an effective ‚Äî if a bit crude ‚Äî
        analogy. The broadcast of Mr. Craft's interview also depicts his
        own deep emotional investment in reading when he begins to shed
        tears, which is not entirely communicated in the written
        article.

        When the American news media discusses American illiteracy, it's
        almost always in secondary or tertiary form: either by way of a
        short post for a weekly education newsletter, an
        ultra-low-distribution niche editorial column, or a personality
        profile of a local activist. Perhaps the fundamental obstacle in
        the face of increasing the discourse surrounding this issue is
        that its resolutions will require ‚Äî perhaps more than any other
        social issue in this country ‚Äî advocacy by those who
        <emphasis>can</emphasis> read on behalf of those who
        <emphasis>cannot</emphasis> because of how sensitive and
        isolated many of them feel. When voices of advocates like
        Lecester Johnson <emphasis>are</emphasis> uplifted by major
        organizations like <emphasis>The Washington Post</emphasis>, the
        sociological weight of the illiteracy issue can be very
        powerful. In quoting former United Nations chief Kofi Annan, she
        sums up for its extensive audience what the facts should
        ultimately mean to them: 32 million of Eric Black's so-called
        ‚Äúilliterate people‚Äù in the United States of America have been
        and continue to be deprived of their
        ‚Äú<emphasis role="strong"><emphasis>human
        right</emphasis></emphasis>‚Äù to functional literacy.

        If you‚Äôve been keeping up with the web at all in the past two
        years, you‚Äôre no doubt at least somewhat familiar with the terms
        ‚ÄúMastodon,‚Äù ‚ÄúDiaspora,‚Äù or ‚Äúfederated social.‚Äù
        <emphasis>Extratone</emphasis> readers may remember
        <link xlink:href="http://www.extratone.com/tech/mastodon/">my
        interview with Eugen Rochko</link> last April ‚Äî the day when his
        federated social ‚Äúclone‚Äù made its way around the front pages of
        the major technology and tech media websites. Though the piece
        itself was designed and written quite disastrously (genuinely
        sorry about that ‚Äî it was easy for me to get carried away when I
        had no idea what I was carrying,) Eugen is a great communicator
        of his ideal, which you‚Äôll find to be as aligned with a FOSS
        future as you‚Äôd think it would be.

      <title>Seven years ago, the fourth generation of Apple‚Äôs iPhone
      instigated a change in our perception of digital photography. Now
      ‚Äì thanks to Google Photos ‚Äì I‚Äôd like to reflect on my favorite
      shots of mine.</title>
      <para>
        When iPhone 4 handsets began shipping in the Summer of 2010, I‚Äôd
        been carrying my first generation for three solid years ‚Äì since
        its now history-stricken release, in fact ‚Äì and its age started
        to become a problem. I‚Äôd drop it screen-down on a rock in the
        airport parking lot just before going back to school for my
        Junior year, splitting a crack in the screen that wouldn‚Äôt quite
        kill it ‚Äì it was the demands of iOS 4 on its 412 MHz CPU and
        meager 128 MB of RAM that would ultimately cease its usability.

        The single 2 megapixel rear-facing camera would surprise one at
        times, but was never lauded as anything but what it was ‚Äì a
        mobile phone-bound sensor capturing very cellular-looking*
        images, but Steve Jobs wasn‚Äôt
        <link xlink:href="https://youtu.be/z__jxoczNWc?t=2m10s">three
        minutes in</link> to his iPhone 4 presentation at the June 2010
        Worldwide Developer‚Äôs Conference before he pronounced the
        design‚Äôs closest possible ‚Äúkin‚Äù to be ‚Äúan old Leica camera,‚Äù
        associating his device with photography in its first impression.
        The equivalent of the first generation‚Äôs rear-facing camera
        could now be found facing <emphasis>you</emphasis>, and the
        fourth‚Äôs primary sensor now shot at 5 megapixels (2592 x 1936)
        with autofocus and 5x digital zoom, setting a fundamental
        smartphone sensor configuration
        <link xlink:href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/9/9/6125849/iphone-history-pictures">standard</link>
        that‚Äôs still adhered to by the industry.
      </para>
      <para>
        After unleashing Google Photos upon the ~15,000 images on my
        home machine‚Äôs hard drive last year, I have been constantly
        reminded of my own photographic history ‚Äì for better or worse ‚Äì
        and regularly shown five, six, seven-year old snaps in a manner
        that wouldn‚Äôt have been possible (or have made any sense)
        before. Recently, I was astounded to find that I took many of
        the better shots with my iPhone 4, so I thought I‚Äôd share a few
        from my high-school days in loving memory of my trusty little
        rectangular companion.

          CR-V ‚Äì the car I drove cross-country for the first time at
          significant distance (St. Louis to Washington, D.C. in
          essentially one sitting,) and once complimented for being the
          best possible aesthetic compromise of its near-universally and
          aggravatingly-compromised breed. It was my her first 1st owner
          experience, which is frankly a bit of a shame. If I‚Äôm
          completely honest, my late stepfather‚Äôs decision to outfit
          this utterly utilitarian vehicle with enough kit to break the
          $30,000 within a segment that has always clung to the 20s as
          one of its truly communicable advantages feels less-than-ideal
          in retrospect, but what can I say, really? It was not exactly
          a proud thing, but it <emphasis>did</emphasis> transport a lot
          of young families and shelter us as we‚Äôve navigated more

          As per some particulars of my upbringing, I tend to get almost
          alarmingly attached to vehicles, but it‚Äôs hard to say I‚Äôm sad
          to see the CR-V go from all but the most sentimental senses.
          Objectively, it‚Äôs simply not as high-value or as competent a
          vehicle as it and its contemporaries are still made out to be
          by automotive media, pop culture, or the presumptions in the
          average consumer‚Äôs discourse. Though it was never intended to
          be luxurious, the resulting automobile ended up costing real
          luxury money.

        incident, though, was entirely the fault of the other driver. My
        best friend and I were Northbound, crossing the intersection of
        Stadium Boulevard and Rock Quarry Road at precisely the point
        where it becomes College Avenue, where we were t-boned directly
        on the CR-V‚Äôs driver‚Äôs side rear wheel by a mid-2000s Mazda 6
        that decided to run the red light. It‚Äôs hard to guess the speed
        of impact, but the driver‚Äôs side side airbags deployed (as
        you‚Äôll see from the attached photograph,) and the CR-V was spun
        nearly 270 degrees around the axis of the front wheels. Neither
        of us nor the 6‚Äôs driver was injured, but both of our vehicles
        are surely totaled.

        <link xlink:href="https://youtu.be/7ucf0Hp3eKk">recorded</link>
        some (not particularly conclusive or informative) thoughts with
        my iPhone as I drove the old engorged Civic to the grocery
        store, when ends abruptly after I said ‚ÄúI think one time I did
        try to go fast.‚Äù Like most surviving crossover nameplates,
        though, the narrative began with a genuinely good idea:
        Hondarize and modernize the Suzuki Sidekick template on top of
        the Civic's platform and charge just a bit more for it ‚Äì and
        like the rest, too, the concept has soured tremendously as both
        crossovers and the compact sedans upon which they're based have
        grown and fattened under their ever-increasing burden of safety
        and convenience features. (I say ‚Äúburden‚Äù and not ‚Äúexpectation,‚Äù
        specifically because I know a grand total of zero informed
        people who are at all thrilled about increasing gross weights
        across every industry segment.)

        This CR-V was my mother‚Äôs first and only crossover following a
        three-car line of one or two-owner-used, well-equipped V6
        Accords in her garage ‚Äì the later two from the era when Honda‚Äôs
        mid-sized sedan became a surprisingly dynamic driving machine as
        advances in drivetrain performance intercepted a point in the
        developmental timeline just before gross weights spiked up
        toward their current safety and electronic equipment-bloated
        figures. (In other words: in the sweet spot when engines were
        growing more powerful but just before the Accord and its peers
        got

        <emphasis>almost</emphasis> attractive looking as specced by
        <link xlink:href="http://www.extratone.com/words/inred/crosscabriolet/">my
        stepfather</link>: the combination of the roof rack, bonnet bra,
        and EX-trim 5-spoke alloys managed to resolve most of the
        discrepancies in the shapes I've seen from other examples, but
        it also drove its price above the $30,000 mark. To be fair to
        Honda, this decision could almost be considered a sortof
        <emphasis>breach of function</emphasis> considering the CR-V's

          Perhaps the greatest letdown of this model year (2010) is its
          legacy four-speed automatic transmission, and I assume the
          next year's inclusion of a brand-new five-speed unit
          drastically improved its driving experience. The specific
          regret one feels when such a development arrives a year after
          buying any new car is one my stepfather still didn't deserve,
          yet he was not spared. However, if <emphasis>you</emphasis>,
          the reader, cannot be dissuaded from buying a CR-V of this
          generation for whatever <emphasis>goddamned</emphasis> reason,
          know that you must choose an example from 2011-onward if you
          want to retain your sanity. No, ye olde four-speed wasn't
          quite as bad as the transmission that
          <link xlink:href="https://youtu.be/zs9ScPleCTw">virtually
          ruined Dodge's new Dart</link> singlehandedly, but it
          certainly shows its age even for the most inattentive or
          merciless driver. Without it, I would vouch for the 2.4L
          four-cylinder's performance as adequate, but its contribution
          was and forever shall be let down by the aging transmission's
          developing Alzheimer's. Simply put: they are an unacceptably

        Back in 2016, <emphasis>Pok√©mon Go</emphasis>, overclocked Apple
        Watches, pissing wearables, and What You See is What You Get
        blogging services all claimed unprecedented casualties among
        consumers according to <emphasis>Futureland</emphasis>'s iOS 10
        episode, which we did our absolute best to dramatize in order to
        survive what was expected to be the dullest event on record.
        We'd only that day been first made aware of Boomerang photos and
        the mysterious nature of ‚ÄúLive Blogging‚Äù as an occupation.
        <link xlink:href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/12/20/14016568/apple-airpods-wireless-earpods-earbuds-review">AirPods
        were introduced</link> and subsequently shit on, and the
        <link xlink:href="https://bilge.world/mono-audio-playback">comparatively
        archaic</link> 3.5mm analog audio jack was confidently parted
        with, finally. At least I got over ‚Äúforgetting‚Äù about Live
        Photos because it's rapidly becoming difficult to keep stuff
        <emphasis>on</emphasis> the phone now. <emphasis>I</emphasis> am
        coming sincerely close to believing none of this is real,
        anyway. Today, though, it‚Äôs a damned straight ballgame, isn‚Äôt
        it? Months have passed since Apple pushed out its major mobile
        OS release of the year to
        <link xlink:href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/1/26/10835748/apple-devices-active-1-billion-iphone-ipad-ios">more
        little rectangular computers</link> than any one person could
        speedcount in a lifetime and YouTube is already recommending me
        dozens of <link xlink:href="https://youtu.be/CXKqCWWjxSM">videos
        about the next one</link>. At this point, you and I are already
        aware of the iOS development community, who has already been
        using Internet Operating System 12 on their personal devices for
        more than half a year by the time your irises are landing here.
        Hopefully, all but two or three stranded, dying explorers in the
        arctic have updated their iPhones and iPads by now, and why
        wouldn‚Äôt they?

      <para>
        Our expectations from this ritual are completely alien compared
        to those we‚Äôd need to anticipate from the event 5 or 6 releases
        ago, when one‚Äôs phone had to be sent away (in a sense) to latch
        itself tight to the stability of a desktop-class product in
        order to undergo a lengthy, destined metamorphosis. Sometimes,
        backups via 30-pin to USB-2.0 cables took hours, after which the
        custodian may or may not find their companion‚Äôs replication had
        completed successfully. If it had, one had to be sure to close
        any applications apart from iTunes to provide a working
        environment of utter silence ‚Äì restarting after finishing the
        download was my own preferred method ‚Äì before entrusting the
        despicably unreliable software to whittle away in a sometimes
        frantically rebooting, feverish procedure with near
        life-threatening stigma: it wasn‚Äôt uncommon for an update to
        inexplicably fail, ‚Äúbricking‚Äù the subject iPhone and requiring
        that one take two whole steps in the wrong direction and restore
        it from the entire backup they‚Äôd just created (hopefully) in
        order to‚Ä¶ make another, precisely-identical attempt, for lack of
        variables or alternatives to the process. However, if the user
        planned sufficiently and made a point to begin the whole charade
        immediately upon arriving home for the evening, these potential
        frustrations could be compensated for, and odds would favor
        counting on their smartphone to emerge safe and sound from the
        procedure just before bed, when even those holding the
        second-newest product in the lineage would have just enough
        screen time to notice that text entry, web page loading, and
        window management had noticeably slowed before sighing and
        tossing their device toward the darkness.

        These days, one would need to try very hard to be inconvenienced
        by iOS updates. My iPhone 8 Plus is two or three times more
        powerful than my laptop at the moment, and my new friends‚Äô WiFi
        connection is better than what the State government uses
        internally, back home. I haven‚Äôt needed to physically back it up
        more than once or twice since I bought it ‚Äî iCloud stores the
        lot for $4.99¬≠ a month anyway. I blinked once watching
        <emphasis>Riki-Oh</emphasis> with high school friends some time
        ago and all of the sudden, a 1.6GB download isn‚Äôt really a big
        deal. Siddown and watch your Instagram stories for twenty
        minutes, and <emphasis>hey</emphasis>! You‚Äôre ready to update!
        Somehow, I have abruptly found myself in a reality in which
        <emphasis role="strong">I am the obvious bottleneck</emphasis>
        and my 100 words per minute on a smartphone keyboard, even, is
        no longer fast enough: my fucking phone is now
        <emphasis role="strong">waiting on me</emphasis> when it
        updates. The keyholder is the whole goddamned holdup.
      </para>
      <para>
        So, what possible purpose could there be in pounding out this
        ‚ÄúReview‚Äù of a free software update that‚Äôs in no way optional
        (waiting a month is no longer a rational minimization of risk ‚Äî
        it‚Äôs just dumb,) not any more difficult to attain than the bills
        currently waiting in your mailbox, nor allowed by the nature of
        mobile operating systems to compete with any cross-platform
        alternatives? For myself, it‚Äôs proved
        <link xlink:href="http://bilge.world/ios-10-review-speed/">a
        gratifying tradition of sorts</link> and a good use of my
        apparently-abundant time if only for the record's sake (hello,
        future web archivists, neohuman and otherwise!,) but this
        release ‚Äì assuming I haven‚Äôt overlooked something ‚Äì is the most
        globe-shucking of all because of one single featureset:
        <emphasis role="strong">Siri Shortcuts</emphasis>. However, the
        vast majority of the intra-Apple press' coverage of this release
        has come across nearly as unconcerned with them as I was
        originally. Take
        <link xlink:href="https://www.macworld.co.uk/review/ios-apps/ios-12-3683670/"><emphasis>Macworld</emphasis>'s
        iOS 12 Review</link>, for instance: it was the first result in
        my Google search for ‚ÄúiOS 12 review,‚Äù yet Siri Shortcuts are
        only mentioned in the bottom quarter of its first page. When I
        recorded the
        ‚Äú<link xlink:href="https://radiopublic.com/end-user-WdbezM/ep/s1!ba096">iOS
        12 Review</link>‚Äù episode of my
        ‚Äú<link xlink:href="https://anchor.fm/davidblue">podcast</link>,‚Äù
        I spoke as if I was somehow the only person on the planet who
        comprehends the profound implications of this software addition
        ‚Äì which was, of course, more of
        <link xlink:href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/03/22/apple-has-acquired-workflow-a-powerful-automation-tool-for-ipad-and-iphone/">an
        absorbent acquisition</link> ‚Äì but I have since discovered one
        gem, at least, which has continued the conversation in a most
        superb manner. It's
        <link xlink:href="https://supercomputer.transistor.fm/about">a
        technology podcast called
        <emphasis>Supercomputer</emphasis></link>, and it's hosted by
        <link xlink:href="https://twitter.com/AlexCox">Alex Cox</link>
        and <link xlink:href="https://twitter.com/AlexCox">Matthew
        Cassinelli</link> ‚Äì the latter of whom developed a significant
        amount of the iOS app
        <link xlink:href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/05/16/workflow-hints-at-the-future-of-the-watch-as-a-computing-platform/">Workflow</link>
        (and wrote most or all of its documentation,
        <link xlink:href="https://anchor.fm/davidblue">apparently</link>,)
        which Apple assimilated as Siri Shortcuts. Both are extremely
        knowledgeable and competent commentators on ‚Äì as far as I can
        hear, at least ‚Äì virtually <emphasis role="strong">the entire
        iOS *lifestyle</emphasis>*. (For those on the outside who've
        never stepped in: laugh if you must, but yes it
        <emphasis>is</emphasis> a lifestyle, still, and it's new thought
        leader
        <link xlink:href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/3/18124416/tim-cook-apple-infowars-white-supremacy-podcasts-platform-adl">isn't
        exactly coming up short</link> these days.) iOS is technically
        <emphasis>software</emphasis>, yes, but it leaves an intractable
        itch for some greater, transcendent term.
      </para>
      <para>

      </para>
      <para>
        In just forty minutes, without any prior knowledge about this
        feature, I was able to create a Shortcut which sends any given
        handset's IP address and precise GPS location (among other
        mundane metrics) in a text message <emphasis role="strong">to my
        phone number</emphasis>. I could share this shortcut among my
        other submissions to
        <link xlink:href="https://sharecuts.app/">Sharecuts</link> or
        <link xlink:href="https://shortcutsgallery.com/">ShortcutsGallery.com</link>,
        where any iOS user could download and subsequently send this
        information back to <emphasis>my</emphasis> phone. (Don't
        believe me?
        <link xlink:href="https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/2873cc28684646e1904f0e80c21c8481">Have
        a go at it yourself</link> and I'll send back a screenshot if
        you'd like.) I accomplished this without any particular skills
        or education in software development or cybersecurity ‚Äì without
        any real <emphasis>malice</emphasis>, even ‚Äì I was just playing
        around. As far as my recollection goes, Apple has
        <emphasis>never</emphasis> included such a powerful,
        potentially-dangerous piece of software in a standard software
        update before. It's both absolutely brilliant and sortof a
        ripoff to be so entrusted for the first time. In many ways ‚Äì
        like my Disable Bluetooth &amp; WiFi shortcut ‚Äì Siri Shortcuts
        represent an awfully half-assed solution to some of the most
        basic, longtime incongruencies within iOS. Sure, it's great that
        I can just make myself a shortcut to completely disable my
        phone's WiFi and Bluetooth activity with one press or Siri
        command (combining ‚Äútype to Siri‚Äù with Siri Shortcuts basically
        enables a form of Command Line functionality in iOS,) but
        frankly, one should've expected the world's largest company to
        <emphasis>do it themselves</emphasis> in perhaps the second of
        third version of this operating system instead of saying
        <emphasis>okay, here are the tools ‚Äì you do it!</emphasis> in
        its <emphasis>twelfth</emphasis>.
      </para>
      <para>
        I've found it inevitable when speaking on iOS to avoid
        discussing the <emphasis>other</emphasis> literature available
        on the subject at any given time. The depth to which technology
        media has assimilated the habits and mannerisms of a single
        American company is absolutely mind-boggling, regardless of its
        history, its market share, or even its recent trillion-dollar
        valuation. Dozens of media companies ‚Äì
        <emphasis><link xlink:href="https://www.cultofmac.com/">CultofMac</link></emphasis>,

        and... more ‚Äì exist solely to cover one single independent
        company: <emphasis role="strong">Apple, Incorporated</emphasis>.
        One wonders how the sum total of the individuals involved with
        and these organizations compares with the total number of
        employees working for the company their careers are (for the
        moment, at least,) entirely centered around. (Further
        interesting questions: are there any comparable situations
        anywhere else in Western capitalism, and if not ‚Äì doesn't this
        sort of attention constitute <emphasis>some kind</emphasis> of
        Monopoly, even if it was not necessarily an anti-competitive
        one?) For ‚Äúreasonable people,‚Äù the image one conjures up of
        <emphasis>The All-The-Time Apple Beat</emphasis> does not lend
        to envy, but let's choose to limit ourselves to only the most
        casual forms of speculation. I do not wish to mock them, for I,
        too remember the sensation of The Apple Drug from an unfortunate
        time in my childhood development when I was willing to wear a
        cheap sweatshirt branded with a stupid Mac vs. Windows Users
        joke unironically to a real live public Junior High school.
        There are few more embarrassing admissions, except perhaps
        admitting that a part of me genuinely yearns to return to this
        level of enthusiasm, as misplaced and cringey as it was. It's
        the addiction to the mystic; it's aspirational in its
        democratization. <emphasis>Billionaires</emphasis> are running
        the same operating system and much of the same software as I am
        every day ‚Äì even the most followed person on any given platform
        is still accessing it through the same interface I might be.
        These are incredible truths, but they also reflect a dangerous
        lack of competition in a product category that has become more
        essential to day-to-day human life than any other in just three
        or four blinks of an eye.

        a five-year-long technology column</link> with some essential
        (if perhaps a bit unoriginal) advice:

        still following along, you shall surely enjoy clicking some of
        his links, and I would certainly encourage that you do until

        listens: his January decree for Apple to bend with the industry
        wind and build
        ‚Äú<link xlink:href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/17/technology/apple-addiction-iphone.html">a
        Less Addictive iPhone</link>‚Äù is convincingly prophetic
        considering <emphasis role="strong">Screen Time</emphasis> ‚Äì
        probably the most mulled-over iOS 12 addition. As someone who
        was diagnosed with Attention Deficit Disorder (however much or
        little that may mean to you) just one or two years after I began
        using my/the first iPhone, I've developed a history of what he
        might call <emphasis>Addiction</emphasis> to iPhones in variable
        oscillation
        <link xlink:href="https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/1042825995546320896">touching
        both extremes</link>. I carried my first-generation iPhone for
        almost 5 years ‚Äì as you can imagine, it was far from a
        100%-functional device toward the end of that bell curve. In
        contrast, I've also stood in line at dawn for two iPhone
        launches, jailbroken, listened to podcasts
        <emphasis>only</emphasis> about apps (far before they were
        good,) and been compelled to chronicle and reflect upon all of
        it for as long as I can remember.
      </para>
      <para>
        There's no denying that the iPhone has had a profound effect on
        my life mostly thanks to my own choices, which is why it's worth
        telling the vast majority of you that features like Screen Time
        will never help you achieve whatever vague conception of
        <emphasis>reduced usage</emphasis> you may have. If you haven't
        yet quantified the figures you'll find within it in mental
        estimates, you aren't really concerned at all and if you
        <emphasis>have</emphasis>, Screen Time will only confirm them.
        Using reminder notifications to optimize your appflow makes no
        attempt at all to actually escape the mentality of the behavior
        you seek to lessen from yourself. Another app is still another
        app; a notification reminding you to stop using an app does
        nothing but add still more stimuli. If you want to stop using
        the phone so much, *<emphasis role="strong">stop* using the
        fucking phone</emphasis>. If you are truly concerned about how
        your handset companion has changed your life, turn it off for a
        week/month/quarter ‚Äì however long you
        <emphasis>possibly</emphasis> can. By that, I mean no more or
        less than what you can manage without getting
        fired/dumped/expelled/etc. If you have
        <emphasis>truly</emphasis> reached this point, anything less is
        probably worth it. There is simply no other way to get a clear
        picture of how it's changed you.
      </para>
      <para>
        Google, Facebook, and the rest of the industry are well aware of
        this, but know they can't <emphasis>actually</emphasis> advocate
        against the fundamental mechanism that drives their businesses,
        so they express concern by doing what they know:
        <emphasis role="strong">building more software</emphasis>. Apple
        is in a slightly different situation: they still need you to buy
        their phones ‚Äì and even to look at them ‚Äì but not past the point
        of hurting yourself emotionally, mentally, or physically because
        those injuries tend to hurt one
        <emphasis>economically</emphasis>. Screen Time's purpose is to
        keep us thriving and buying, but the only effective solve for
        this can only be communicated in garbage cinema language:
        <emphasis role="strong">you must find it within
        yourself</emphasis>. I am <emphasis>actually</emphasis> the
        worst person from which to model your life, except perhaps for
        my iPhone use: unless there's little else worthy of my
        attention, my phone is not out. Even if checking my emails
        (<email>davidblue@gmail.com</email>),
        <link xlink:href="https://mastodon.social/@DavidBlue">Mastodon</link>,
        <link xlink:href="https://twitter.com/neoyokel">Twitter</link>,
        etc. are my default tasks, there are infinitely many besides
        that come first. Every once in a while, it's okay to finish an
        important message while walking down the street or waiting at a
        stoplight if things are urgent, but I can guarantee you that my
        attention is better consolidated on traveling in 95% of cases ‚Äì
        moving with purpose and then focusing on my composition
        <emphasis>after</emphasis> I've arrived is almost always more
        efficient. I realize that I'm cowboying it here and sound like
        your Dad, but I'm better with iOS than he is, yet I've never
        publicly run into anything while looking down at my smartphone
        in 10 years of hardcore use. <emphasis role="strong">Find

        Gartenberg, who's review ‚Äì for the record ‚Äì was much more useful

        However, isn't it sortof unreasonable to expect anything but
        <emphasis>absolute perfection</emphasis> from Apple at this
        trillion-dollar juncture? A handful of varying interpretations
        of absolute perfection per product category, even.

        completely invisible across the under-30 demographic, yet I‚Äôve
        found a special originality in his voice since first exploring
        it and I think it might be worth requalification. A good friend

        Owl</emphasis></link> out of a bulk box of bargain books she‚Äôd
        bought as a preteen, long ago and became an enthusiastic fan of
        his perspective and a harsh, but fond critic of his persona. It
        was her copy of his second that I read first:
        <link xlink:href="https://www.npr.org/2011/10/04/141015210/visible-man-asks-what-if-no-one-were-watching"><emphasis>The

        gifted outcast</emphasis> tale that classically exemplifies the
        easy-to-digest yet thoughtfully-exploratory reputation of his
        craft. Thanks to her library card, I was able to follow it up
        immediately with Chuck‚Äôs latest, most topical work ‚Äì an
        anthology of past essays written for publications like
        <emphasis>The Guardian</emphasis>,
        <emphasis>Grantland</emphasis>, and <emphasis>GQ</emphasis>
        entitled <emphasis>X: A Highly Specific, Defiantly Incomplete
        History of the Early 21st Century</emphasis>, which proved an
        impossibly entertaining, even more polished execution of The
        Quaint Chuck‚Äôs Explanations in non-fiction form, beginning at
        onset with refreshing brevity in its
        <link xlink:href="http://bit.ly/ckintro">introduction</link>.

        Using ‚Äúpretentious‚Äù even when just vaguely and loosely

        toward the benefit of its experience. If you substitute
        <emphasis>car nerds</emphasis> for
        <emphasis>sportswriters</emphasis>, I‚Äôd personally identify with
        this picoautobiography in a big way, but more importantly as a
        <emphasis>reader</emphasis> I had never encountered anything
        written about sports which I would describe as
        <emphasis>pretentious</emphasis>, per se, and that realization

      <para>
        Now, during what we should hope to be the first dawn of a new
        microera of sincerity, we must recognize how valuable it is for
        Klosterman as an observer to be comfortably engaged with his
        subjects, emotionally, and confident in the value of his
        commentary in middleage without the need to insist upon his
        eccentricity, as so many cringey, culturally-daft Dads do, these
        days. He uses keywords in his writing and spoken publicity that
        <emphasis>should</emphasis> dismiss him immediately as one of
        these ‚Äì a nostalgic, out-of-time dork ‚Äì but are instead somehow
        magically manipulated to <emphasis>serve</emphasis> him in
        articulating reasonable, even profoundly-innovative insight. As
        I have explored his bibliography and his publicly-expressed
        thoughts, I have been caught up and hinged on a single
        supposition: <emphasis role="strong">Chuck Klosterman is the
        only white, 46-year-old bearded Portland Dad you should be
        reading</emphasis>. Do mind that I am in no way exempt from this
        lens, but it‚Äôs still my job to determine his viability as an
        intellectual ‚Äì a ‚Äúthought leader,‚Äù even ‚Äì for those of us who
        were conceived around the same time he was wrapping up his
        collegiate sentence at the University of North Dakota.
      </para>
      <para>
        For a solid hunk of the American reading audience, a quick,
        elemental vector of quality and mastery we look for in an
        essayist is the ability to ‚Äútranscend‚Äù their subject matter for
        even the most presumptuous and conceited among us, usually to
        deliver a more abstract sentiment to leave with. Here,
        Klosterman‚Äôs significant career experience is irrefutably
        evident ‚Äì in <emphasis>X</emphasis>, he achieves this
        transcendence organically with a fluidity unlike anything I‚Äôve
        read before. We can already check a single box: convincing even
        a young professional twenty-something to shell out for a
        physical hardback of contemporary non-fiction requiring any sort
        of academic effort to consume is going to be nigh-impossible,
        even though <emphasis>X</emphasis> actually happens to be the
        best-looking specimen of print product design I have ever
        handled across cover, type, and layout. It‚Äôs been difficult
        having to convince myself to give this copy back.

        Klosterman interview for <emphasis>Recode Media</emphasis> is an

        introduces <emphasis>X</emphasis> with an outright confession:
        ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs great. I bought it. I bought a signed copy,‚Äù which is an
        unexpected oddity (though not an unwelcome one ‚Äì I‚Äôm glad Peter
        enjoys his life.) Their conversation dips briefly in personal
        history (Chuck and his wife moved to Portland from Brooklyn for
        its proximity to family) before plopping down upon the substance
        of his clearly superb and matter-of-fact interview technique.
        I‚Äôm not sure I‚Äôve ever heard a conversation between Kafka and
        any previous guests with whom he was quite so obviously alike in
        general disposition.

        From the broadest possible pop cultural lens, Chuck's most
        spectacular and widely-circulated work, demographically (I

        <link xlink:href="https://www.gq.com/story/taylor-swift-gq-cover-story">2015
        interview and cover story</link> for <emphasis>GQ</emphasis>
        with Taylor Swift ‚Äì then ‚Äúthe most popular human alive.‚Äù Yes, it

        sitting awkwardly next to her in the backseat of her car as she
        maniacally panics to accept a call from Justin Timberlake. When
        one Chucks such a distinguished contrast upon such a
        high-profile contemporary medium, the weight of the potential
        scrutiny becomes palpable, but Klosterman anticipates and braces
        for this (very risky) business in the only manner he can:
        acknowledging it over and over and <emphasis>over</emphasis>
        again in the second paragraph of his every interview appearance.

          That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm writing about her is because I do think she‚Äôs a

          just perceive themselves as somebody who‚Äôs a watchdog for
          certain signifiers or certain elements of the culture and that

        read anything about Taylor Swift outside of this very white
        man's anthology. Fundamental themes of power and control are
        threaded throughout both his fiction and non-fiction, which is
        especially prevalent in the Macho Big Boy cultures of the
        athletics and music industries. In profiling Taylor Swift ‚Äì the
        undisputed apex of the latter in 2015 ‚Äì Klosterman provided a
        firsthand account of the grueling maintenance of a public and

          It‚Äôs somehow different when the hub of the wheel is Swift.
          People get skeptical. Her famous friends are marginalized as
          acquisitions, selected to occupy specific roles, almost like
          members of the Justice League ('the ectomorph model,' 'the
          inventive indie artist,' 'the informed third-wave feminist,'

        sort of ridiculous dance in which ‚Äúmany people feel the reason

        United States who spend much of their time reading anything
        solely for the sake of absorption, and the disparity between
        those who were and weren‚Äôt was exponentially greater in the

        waning and waxing democratization, but many of the more

          Last weekend I was in a hashish bar in Amsterdam. It was
          post-dusk, pre-night. The music was terrible (fake reggae,
          late-period Eric Clapton, Sublime deep cuts.) I was sitting
          next to a British stranger with a shaved head and a speech
          impediment. Our conversation required subtitles, so I imagined
          them in my mind. He told me he had lost three family members
          within the past year: his mother, who was sixty-six; his
          uncle, who was fifty-six; and his sister, who was forty-six.
          He said he'd just turned thirty-six. He asked if I saw a
          pattern developing. ‚ÄúYes,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúBut only numerically.‚Äù I
          asked what he did for a living. He said he was a housepainter.
          He asked me the same question about myself. ‚ÄúI manufacture
          opinions,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúReally?‚Äù he asked. ‚ÄúHow do you know if
          you‚Äôre any good at that?‚Äù ‚ÄúBy the number of people who agree
          or disagree,‚Äù I said in response. ‚ÄúIf a large number of

          or wildly wrong, there is somehow a perception that I am
          succeeding at this vocation.‚Äù ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs interesting,‚Äù said the

        pop science conversations without using any of the academic

        Reading Chuck Klosterman is going to be perturbing, but true
        sincerity is almost always uncomfortable. Comprehensively, his

        neckbeards. Such a feat would require entire new planes of
        cultural awareness and dialectal delicacy, yet certainly result
        in zero personal reward from even the best possible outcome, yet
        I proceeded to ponder the subject very deliberately all the way
        through October because I genuinely believed in a new
        democratized future of computing. 2018 had been my Grand
        Awakening to the idyllic possibilities of Free and Open Source
        Software (FOSS) across the whole applied spectrum from office
        suites to
        <link xlink:href="http://bilge.world/federated/">social
        networks</link>, yet ‚Äì as two thousand eighteen comes to an end
        ‚Äì I‚Äôve managed to find myself among the most
        <link xlink:href="https://youtu.be/O0RSeFcv3Qs">jaded,

        Complimenting this Linux-laden culture in which I was not so
        long ago deeply embedded was a confused and frustrated outlook
        regarding what I felt were excessive and completely idiotic
        sacrifices across the industry‚Äôs hardware design to the greedy,
        gluttonous god of Lightness. It seemed only reasonable to Myself
        As Consumer that the entire buying public should exclusively
        seek designs prioritizing greatest possible performance and
        battery life, even from portable computers and smartphones, so I
        assumed my perspective on this updated iteration of Microsoft's
        most laptopy Surface laptop ‚Äì which exists in large part to
        <link xlink:href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/364728/spec-down-apple-macbook-air-vs-microsoft-surface-laptop-2">compete
        directly with</link> Apple's beloved (and just-updated) MacBook
        Air ‚Äì wouldn't be at all useful. However, a few weeks ago, my
        employer prompted me with a sweet sweet ultimatum: <emphasis>for
        the sake of a tax break, I want to spend ~$1000 on a laptop for
        you as soon as possible</emphasis>. Yes, I know I should
        consider myself a very fortunate man ‚Äì this
        <link xlink:href="https://bilge.world/hp-spectre-x360-review">wasn't
        even the first time</link> I'd been surprised with the ‚Äúhey, I
        want to buy you a laptop but it has to be today‚Äù experience, and
        may even be considered a sort of sequel to my <emphasis>Tales of
        Whirlwind Manic Consumerism</emphasis>, but it‚Äôs ultimately one
        of the most idiotic strategies to achieve a major purchase
        decision and completely inadvisable for anyone on a budget.
        Still I was indeed thankful to be put in a nearly-identical
        situation of Consumer Electronic haste, and have come to be
        especially appreciative of the specific time I was approached as
        such: just one week after

        indulge me so, you‚Äôll notice that Microsoft has actually
        delivered unto us <emphasis role="strong">The Laptop

        truly represent the second coming of the <emphasis>Notebook
        Christ</emphasis>? Naturally, it would be a bit zealous to stand
        behind this extreme statement with 100% sincerity, but there
        truly <emphasis>are</emphasis> certain elements of this Personal
        Computing product's execution which do indeed will its user to
        expect and/or desire from others in coming years. As I've stated
        before, I also simply cannot help but be jazzed by such bravado
        from the mouths of even a company with as crooked and hateful
        history as Microsoft's. (Note: no other technology company has
        actually achieved what Microsoft historically has in this
        regard, and hopefully none ever will again.)

        I must be honest: it hasn't yet been two months and I've already

        <link xlink:href="https://www.popularmechanics.com/cars/a9653/what-is-alcantara/">alcantara

        any reasonable measure. For my own sake, I hope I‚Äôm able to fall
        in child-like infatuation with its magic, but in the interim, I
        believe the coldness of my heart should hopefully preserve any
        useful commentary I might have to add. Though this is
        undoubtedly the most timely review of a hardware product I‚Äôve
        ever published, I‚Äôd still ask that you indulge my perspective
        suggesting the importance of considering it part of a

        In case I‚Äôve yet to mention it, all of my tech writing is in
        substantial debt to my much-older and child-oriented siblings
        for providing 8 nieces and nephews over the course of 11 years ‚Äì
        if not for any reason but the perspective offered by the
        slightest observation of their day-to-day lives. In this
        profoundly bizarre and historic technological sprint our species
        is experiencing, the differences in their respective
        relationships with consumer tech as they‚Äôve grown up are
        fascinatingly‚Ä¶ disturbingly significant. My eldest niece Abby
        was born four years after myself in 1998, and her younger sister
        Amber just quite three years later in 2001. All three of us are
        Aquarians who went to the same public schools (aside from 2
        exceptions on my part,) and the two sisters have been close,
        significant influences on each other all their lives, yet the
        way Abby and I use and think about computers differs
        significantly from Amber‚Äôs. Our first real PCs introduced an
        important social and intellectual vehicle to our pre-teen lives,
        and both of us still ‚Äúlive on‚Äù our machines as young adults. For
        us and many others from this short-lived microgeneration of
        ours, budget laptops like the Dell Inspirion 2200 (which served
        as the first ‚Äúreal computer‚Äù for both of us) introduced the
        internet and Being Online as a State of Being with AIM groups,
        MySpace, and Yahoo! chain mails before smartphones and tablets
        were capable of doing so.

        Amber prefers to use her iPhone for most everything and regards

        than the habit Abby, myself, and many of my Online friends
        developed: we left our computers running and Logged On all the
        time because we were otherwise unreachable. We learned from
        origin to depend on them for 100% of our computing tasks ‚Äì from
        streaming Pandora to playing Flash games within six billion open

        The opportunity I‚Äôve had in the past year to finally get my
        Linux distro frenzy over with and out of my system managed to
        both radicalize and democratize my understanding of MacOS,
        Windows, and Linux as they are in the present. While I had
        nothing better to do, fiddling with Ubuntu Studio and Linux Mint
        to the extent I did throughout Spring and Summer led me to
        further appreciate

        continue to sprout from the Linus Extended Universe and the
        <link xlink:href="http://bit.ly/dbmastodon">growing Open Source
        community on Mastodon</link> is filled with brilliant, helpful,
        unpretentious, and remarkably curious enthusiasts (probably
        because many of those I‚Äôve interacted with so far are non-cis
        and/or non-white,) little ole me was able to stumble upon some
        totally unnecessary and excruciatingly ignorant sociopolitical
        commentary by way of the white, middle-age host and his
        undoubtedly-white and staunchly libertarian caller on a live
        broadcast of the <emphasis>Ask Noah Show</emphasis>. (It‚Äôs not
        as if I haven‚Äôt said ignorant and very ugly things too, but I
        wasn‚Äôt a forty-something <emphasis>father</emphasis> on a
        semi-professional talk show representing an entire community.)
      </para>
      <para>
        Essentially, I was quite frustrated and disappointed to find
        that <emphasis role="strong">Linux is still let down most by its
        own community</emphasis>, but the operating system itself is
        still <emphasis>much</emphasis> further along on its way to
        becoming a real alternative for the average user than mainstream
        tech journalism would have you believe. However, in my case,
        finally taking the time to <emphasis>really</emphasis> learn
        about Open Source computing <emphasis>also</emphasis> helped me
        understand (surprisingly) why Apple and its environment continue
        to be the best and most popular choice for professional
        applications. Linux Mint gave me tremendous power in enabling me
        to alter, specify, and redesign the most minute details of its
        interface, but I couldn‚Äôt have foreseen how all-consuming such
        power would be for someone like myself. In retrospect, I‚Äôve
        realized that I ended up spending more time perfecting my custom
        LibreOffice Writer shortcuts than I did <emphasis>actually
        writing</emphasis> ‚Äì I somehow found myself in a mind state
        which justified unironically creating <emphasis>a shortcut for
        the Shortcuts menu</emphasis>. Though I swore I‚Äôd never succumb
        to the bewildering hobby of collecting and exploring different
        Linux Distributions, it took no time at all for me to fill a
        folder with disc images of the installers for almost a dozen
        different interpretations of the operating system after I‚Äôd made
        the simple concession to myself that <emphasis>I‚Äôll just try
        Ubuntu, that‚Äôs all</emphasis>. The most profound realization
        from all this (arguably otherwise wasted) time:
        <emphasis role="strong">for a user like me, a walled garden is
        actually the best place to be productive</emphasis> because
        <emphasis>apparently</emphasis>, I don‚Äôt have the self-control
        to keep myself from <emphasis>running away</emphasis> and/or
        fixating on completely unproductive tasks without its
        boundaries. I think this phenomenon is perhaps the worst culprit
        in the persistence of the aforementioned divide between
        ‚Äúcomputer people‚Äù and everyone else who simply
        <emphasis>uses</emphasis> computers, as I‚Äôm sure any one of the
        latter could tell you after all of five minutes with a Linus
        type.

        The most comprehensive and somewhat-urgent revision to
        illustrate the significance of this contrast from my perspective
        regards the exceptional iOS/MacOS markdown-based notetaking app
        Bear. Frankly, my own
        ‚Äú<link xlink:href="https://bilge.world/evernote-dropbox-paper-word-processing-history">Word
        Processing Methodology</link>‚Äù essay from June has already
        become problematically out of date (and therefore embarrassing)
        in terms of my own knowledge of the segment and its history.
        Though I promised the conversation was ‚Äúdone,‚Äù I‚Äôve continued to
        explore further into word processing‚Äôs history as well as its
        current state. ‚ÄúI had a go at Bear‚Äôs free iOS experience and saw
        little functional difference from DayOne,‚Äù the old, negligent,
        cursory David Blue noted, but if I‚Äôd simply been willing to
        cough up a bit more time and just $1.49 a month for
        <link xlink:href="https://bear.app/#pricing">Bear Pro</link>,
        I‚Äôd have spared myself such shame and realized that the hype
        around this app really is 100% justified.
        <emphasis role="strong">Bear is the most beautiful iOS app I‚Äôve
        ever seen</emphasis>, but I‚Äôm now also fully qualified to
        declare it the most effective execution of ‚Äúdistraction-free‚Äù
        writing software to come along in the past 25 years. Developer
        Shiny Frog‚Äôs secret is their perfect balance between capability
        and simplicity. It turns out,

        <emphasis>really was</emphasis> worth more than mine, not to

        underneath the surface.‚Äù

      <para>
        Those longtime Linux and Windows diehards who‚Äôve tolerated me
        thus far, listen up: MacOS may be ancient, neglected, and full
        of incongruencies, but its single-minded methodology paired with
        Apple‚Äôs iCloud <emphasis>really does</emphasis> make it the most
        effective and elegant environment for most people to simply
        <emphasis>get shit done</emphasis>. It‚Äôs clear that many of you
        have realized the importance of simplicity for compact and/or
        educational distributions, but let me just add that
        <emphasis role="strong">the democratization of Linux provides a
        gargantuan development opportunity to make something that beats
        MacOS at its own game</emphasis> without starting from such a
        shitty premise and all of its resulting compromises ‚Äì all
        without detracting from any other technically-minded
        distributions whatsoever. <emphasis>That</emphasis> is the magic
        of <emphasis>The Distro</emphasis>, remember?! If you‚Äôve existed
        in a similar state of confusion to that of my entire adult life
        regarding the appeal of Apple products ‚Äì despite having once
        been an extensive OSX user, myself ‚Äì <emphasis>you‚Äôre very
        welcome</emphasis> for the insight. Instead of paying me for the
        profound self-improvement I‚Äôve just provided, try prioritizing
        this newfound knowledge the next time you talk to your MacBook
        Pro-loving friend about their workflow. If you‚Äôre like myself,
        you‚Äôll find their arguments have magically transformed from the
        bewildering bullshit they‚Äôve always seemed to be into challenges
        for future competing operating systems to surpass Apple‚Äôs old
        bitch and excel in because MacOS and
        <link xlink:href="https://bilge.world/siri-shortcuts-ios12-review">even
        its much-younger iOS counterpart</link> ‚Äì as well as the
        billions of people who depend on them ‚Äì

        the world‚Äôs wealthiest company <emphasis>should</emphasis> be.
      </para>
      <para>
        Yes, the manner in which these operating systems are perceived
        really <emphasis>is</emphasis> an important discussion prompted
        by a product as insignificant as the Surface Laptop 2 because as
        you read, the industry is bracing for another <emphasis>paradigm
        shift</emphasis> in computing, which many believe
        (preposterously, I might add) could be as significant and
        disruptive as 2007‚Äôs introduction of the iPhone. This machine of
        Microsoft‚Äôs and its ‚Äúnew‚Äù MacBook Air counterpart could
        potentially be the last designs to carry us to a computing
        future where the tried-and-true clamshell design is forgone
        entirely by the mainstream, but

        full review of the updated product</link>, along with a
        beautifully transient sentiment which I think we all needed to
        hear again: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think people should adapt to their
        computers. Computers should adapt to people.‚Äù Even something as
        consumerist and bourgeois as the introduction of another
        pricepoint-burgeoning Apple hardware flagship can turn a simple
        tablet review into a much-needed manifesto for a user-centric
        way forward for the industry, which is itself worthy of
        celebratory encouragement.

        I‚Äôve favored <emphasis>The Verge</emphasis> and its cast long

        <emphasis>truly</emphasis> special and profound gems of content
        that shouldn‚Äôt be passed up. Apparently ‚Äì as the Editor-in-Chief
        immediately insists as the episode begins ‚Äì his ‚Äúongoing theory‚Äù
        that ‚Äúthe more important you are, the less actually important

        and thereby implicitly <emphasis>sponsoring</emphasis> over its
        much older brother as the ultimate heir of the majority‚Äôs future

        growing the iPad Pro into the ‚Äúlaptop replacement‚Äù we‚Äôd all
        heard so much about. Of iOS 12‚Äôs performance as an operating
        system beneath true work-related tasks, he exasperates ‚Äúyou have
        to spend all of your time figuring out how to do stuff instead
        of doing stuff,‚Äù which I couldn‚Äôt help but hear as echoes of my
        own late Linux lamentations. As thankful as I am to have finally
        achieved enlightenment of the Planet Apple, I‚Äôm afraid I was
        pitifully late: its very natural laws underwent their most
        brutal tests of the 21st century this past year. Now that I‚Äôve
        finally come to adore the elegant effectiveness of a new
        generation of iOS apps like Bear, I‚Äôm faced with yet another of
        the episode‚Äôs statements of weight: ‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs time to stop
        pretending that the future of computing looks like Apple‚Äôs
        restrictions.‚Äù On the opposing end of the line, the world‚Äôs

        had started with a traditional design like the Surface Laptop

        with products we can‚Äôt believe in, but it‚Äôs up to you to decide
        if this issue is worth expending your energy in advocacy for

        completely bewildered by the iPad as anything but an indulgence

        Since you last heard from us, the federated social network
        <link xlink:href="https://extratone.com/mastodon-eugen-rochko-federated-social-network">Mastodon</link>
        has scaled tremendously in usership and steadily grown
        technologically into an incredibly robust and dynamic platform.
        Perhaps inevitably, Eugen Rochko and his gaggle of open source
        developers have continued to embarrass the living fuck out of
        Twitter's team ‚Äì at least for those who've continued to pay
        attention (i.e. those of us whose sense of aspiration has yet to
        perish.)

        I planned on getting ahead of an innovative wake in iOS
        development by watching closely for the first ‚Äúpremium‚Äù Mastodon
        clients to come out, which I suspected (quite correctly) would
        carry the first substantial risk-taking on the part of plucky
        social apps to be seen on the goddamned App Store in what felt
        like eternity. Unfortunately, I've ended up far too deep in
        screenshots/insights from
        <emphasis role="strong"><link xlink:href="http://bit.ly/tootios">Toot!</link></emphasis>
        and
        <emphasis role="strong"><link xlink:href="http://bit.ly/mastios">Mast</link></emphasis>,
        creating a bit of an overwhelming obstacle in comparing and/or
        reviewing the two without sinking deep in my regular,
        pretentious hole. (Though both of them are absolutely gorgeous,
        fascinating, and impressive projects which you should invest in

        You fight your superficiality, your shallowness, so as to try to
        come at people without unreal expectations, without an overload
        of bias or hope or arrogance, as untanklike as you can be, sans
        cannon and machine guns and steel plating half a foot thick; you
        come at them unmenacingly on your own ten toes instead of
        tearing up the turf with your caterpillar treads, take them on
        with an open mind, as equals, man to man, as we used to say, and
        yet you never fail to get them wrong. You might as well have the
        <emphasis>brain</emphasis> of a tank. You get them wrong before
        you meet them, while you're anticipating meeting them; you get
        them wrong while you're with them; and then you go home to tell
        somebody else about the meeting and you get them all wrong
        again. Since the same generally goes for them with you, the
        whole thing is really a dazzling illusion empty of all
        perception, an astonishing farce of misperception. And yet what
        are we to do about this terribly significant business of
        <emphasis>other people</emphasis>, which gets bled of the
        significance we think it has and takes on instead a significance
        that is ludicrous, so illequipped are we all to envision one
        another's interior workings and invisible aims? Is everyone to
        go off and lock the door and sit secluded like the lonely
        writers do, in a soundproof cell, summoning people out of words
        and then proposing that these word people are closer to the real
        thing than the real people that we mangle with our ignorance
        every day? The fact remains that getting people right is not
        what living is all about anyway. It's getting them wrong that is
        living, getting them wrong and wrong and wrong and then, on
        careful reconsideration, getting them wrong again. That's how we
        know we're alive: we're wrong. Maybe the best thing would be to
        forget being right or wrong about people and just go along for
        the ride. But if you can do that‚Äîwell, lucky you.

        Since 2007, the church has been expanding from its first home
        (as a functional place of worship, anyway,) which lies within 1)
        line-of-sight from one of
        <link xlink:href="https://www.insidephilanthropy.com/dance/2013/7/31/nancy-walton-laurie-ballets-next-best-friend.html">Nancy

        the acreage is blackened by pragmatically-arrayed big box
        store-caliber multi-rowed parking. Ye, by night, it is flooded
        in coordinately-distributed cold white light suspended by the
        same uniform steel poles which guard long-term airport lots.
        Naturally, the entry and exit points for the asphalt spread are
        arranged deliberately opposed so that four figures‚Äô worth of
        God‚Äôs children may be fed, digested, and evacuated through their
        weekly appointment with Christ as efficiently and
        <emphasis>hassle-free</emphasis> as possible.

        God‚Äôs ~white~ children become <emphasis>especially</emphasis>

        rampant misconception that simultaneously allows them a renewed
        sense of control over their environment. Psychoanalytic
        observation has suggested it is catalyzed by delusions of
        physical anonymity, exemption from civic responsibility, and a
        titanically-inflated perception of their personally
        misattributed contributions to the perpetuation of the universe.

        I do not mean to disparage <emphasis>The Crossing</emphasis>,
        specifically nor even organized religion, generally, but instead
        to emphasize the absurdities which have leapt just as readily
        into what I‚Äôd specifically call <emphasis>The
        Business</emphasis> of white protestant Christianity over just
        the course of my own maturation as it has into any other aspect
        of our lives. The difference, of course, is the universal set of
        exceptions ‚Äì and the particular <emphasis>age</emphasis> of said
        exceptions ‚Äì which religion maintains, societally. The
        perspective formed by my own experiences having grown up wholly
        embedded across the spectrum of white midwestern Christianity ‚Äì
        including two years of vigorous and quite academic study of the
        Bible in a tiny private school headquartered in the basement of
        a Lutheran church ‚Äì lends to a particular skepticism, amusement,
        horror, offense, and existential astonishment that latches my
        fascination into a not-entirely-voluntary hold.

        Upon meeting an elderly recently immigrated German friend of my

        <emphasis>He looks German!... and so tall!</emphasis> Both of
        these compliments were <emphasis>relatively</emphasis> true, but
        certainly not extremely. I am more German-looking than not,
        perhaps. Supposedly, I am half a product of a very large family
        whose elders are only one and two generations from German
        royalty ‚Äì my legal last name is on a state sign in front of a

        half siblings grew up mostly in the town of Schweinfurt, I have
        never actually set foot in Germany, yet I‚Äôve come to identify
        with and admire its culture enough to (perhaps unjustly or
        inappropriately) feel comfortable joking about Deutsche

        Unavoidably, the most notable, remarkable, and extraordinary

        (though <emphasis>technically</emphasis> correct.)
      </para>
      <para>
        I'm not entirely sure why the Atlas weighs so much, but its mass
        is inevitably a major variable in just about every facet of its
        experience as a product. The best potential hoot to be had from
        it as a driving device should be sought by ordering it to
        shuffle briskly on curving country blacktops in Sport Mode with
        all the assists (save for lane-keeping) <emphasis>on</emphasis>.
        Not to be too crude, but it's fun to make the fat fucker run.
        Through your ass, you can feel the suspension squirm and
        struggle to redirect all
        <link xlink:href="https://www.motortrend.com/cars/volkswagen/atlas/2018/2018-volkswagen-atlas-se-long-term-update-1-review/">266
        lb.-ft. of VR6 oomf between 4 wheels</link> beneath an entirely
        separate war against the physics of such top-heavy body roll.
      </para>
      <para>
        <emphasis>Scrambling</emphasis> is definitely the correct verb.
        Pleasantly light steering in Comfort Mode (where I'd advise you
        leave it in virtually any situation) combined with a supple-ish
        ride from multilink suspension provide a trace of a past luxury
        sentiment not unlike the energy exhibited by my old Connie
        through and through. It's all about the sensation of
        <emphasis role="strong">power</emphasis>. Not in the horse
        sense, but in the satisfaction achieved from the manipulation of
        maximum mass with minimum effort. Comparatively, the level of
        actual ego-stroking is of course quite miniscule, and
        unfortunately, it is the numbness that is most noticeably left
        over with very little gain.
      </para>
      <para>
        Also unfortunate: I did not end up making the opportunity to
        truly test whatever offroad capabilities the Atlas may posses in
        any sort of formalized test. My example came with Hill Descent
        Control and Hill Start Assist, and I was able to find a small
        hill just steep enough to
        <link xlink:href="https://youtu.be/REchJ_BD5G0?t=232">trigger
        the former</link>. I cannot say I'd put my money on the Atlas
        winning the Dakar as it is, but we now know it can handle wet
        grass on a mild incline. What about county road gravel?
        Realistically, these are the two extremes 99% of Atlas' will

          In Platinum Gray Metallic, the Atlas looks authoritative

          Tourmaline Blue Metallic, Pacific Blue Metallic, and Fortana

          SUV with its existing design language. Though the Atlas is by

        My only authentic Road Rage experience in some 5000 miles of
        rideshare driving occurred on All Hallow's Eve when I stopped ‚Äì
        no more illegally than usual ‚Äì on the opposite corner from a
        popular downtown Mexican restaurant called The Nap with hazards
        and all courtesy interior lights shining. The car immediately
        behind me hesitated no more than necessary, but the Biggest Big
        Infiniti behind them (a QX80 ‚Äì the Atlas' competitor) just...
        stopped. There was honking and frenzied, hoarse screaming of
        <emphasis>what the fuck are you doing?</emphasis> and such.
      </para>
      <para>
        I responded with pleasantly amused but relatively-encouraging
        glances at the impersonal black mass of the Infiniti's
        windshield through my mirrors. I rolled down the Atlas' driver's
        side window and politely gestured that they go around me, but
        failed to coax any movement whatsoever from the ugly behemoth
        through at least two full cycles of the nearby traffic light.
        There must be some aquatic authority in the bulbous black ass of
        the QX80, for no one behind it seemed willing to pass either.
        The driver waited significantly longer than you'd imagine before
        emerging, huffy. She was wearing a classic poofy black North
        Face vest some sort of slate gray turtleneck. Nothing below
        these were stimulating enough to retain any memory of.

        there. I tried to listen and respond with as much sincerity as
        possible as I realized all at once that my behavior had
        genuinely <emphasis>perturbed</emphasis> this woman ‚Äì that her
        choice to leave the huge hideous warmth of the guppy wagon to
        speak as humans to one another required great courage.

        I inserted the next logical question which I'd been screaming

        I began to pity her when I then saw in her face the distinct
        possibility that <emphasis>going around</emphasis> as a concept

        Here, one of the most fascinating avenues of suburban psychology
        is explored: Guppy Mom is not being ingenuine with this
        expression, nor has she had an untoward experience with law
        enforcement, ever. Guppy Mom did know her excuse was bullshit ‚Äì
        nobody has ever been written a traffic citation for carefully
        circumventing an obstacle in the road. Given the opportunity to
        interrogate this kernel of entirely uncompromising obedience to
        utterly delusional traffic law superstitions, I think we'd
        simply discover a life of unnaturally positive interactions with
        LEOs. We must conclude, then, that the source of her fear was
        either myself or the Atlas.

        Granted, to her I am still a <emphasis>Young Man</emphasis>, and
        am therefore instinctively programmed to believe myself more

        architects of modern civilization. Her Stucco Highness may have
        felt a representative of these builders (edgy take:
        <emphasis>she is in fact their servant</emphasis>.) Her own
        folks surely complain regularly about their distaste for
        disrespect, and my gig-economy, Austin Powers-looking ass was
        somehow disrespecting the order laid down by her would be
        (entirely fantastical) forefathers. Though her expression of her
        quaint fear of such ‚Äúugliness‚Äù (if you will) is hard-headed, an
        ugliest decision of hers (or her kin) idled behind me, its giant
        seafood-looking mouth gaping, unhinged. It'd almost be more
        redeemable if it was a hardcore, chronic mouthbreather. (The
        QX80 is actually
        <link xlink:href="https://www.autoguide.com/auto-news/2019/05/2019-infiniti-qx80-pros-and-cons.html">powered

        Freedom from fear is the sum desire of all the most primitive
        compulsions we share. Ultimately, the only efficient and
        reasonable response to Mrs. Guppy's kind in such a situation is
        to very kindly oblige, which I did, of course, with great
        respect and great pity. In the months since this encounter, I'd
        been wondering what was missing from the outline of this Atlas

        a factor for the American carbuyer.

        primary motivation for buying full-sized SUVs. Mrs. Guppy's

        disconnected supposition/folktale continues to thrive so

        physical presence, and actual driving sensation must communicate

            Ultimately, the Atlas is far from a dynamic, agile machine,
            but it feels comfortable and unintimidating to drive, and
            perfectly at home on US city streets and the slower-paced
            driving of California highways.

        Surprisingly, the Atlas carries a rare and precious jewel of
        automotive history under its broad, satisfying hood. The VR6
        ‚Äúzig zag‚Äù arrangement is actually one of
        <link xlink:href="https://www.roadandtrack.com/car-culture/a9988768/volkswagen-vr6-dying/">Volkswagen

        <para>
          ‚ÄòVR‚Äô stands for V-Reihenmotor, which translates to V-Inline,
          describing both vee and inline cylinder layouts. That is, of
          course, contradictory. The unit is actually a very
          narrow-angle V6, displacing 2861cc, with two offset banks of
          cylinders at 15 degrees to one another. Unlike a conventional
          V6, but exactly like an inline six, there‚Äôs just one cylinder
          head. The result is a six-cylinder engine that‚Äôs both much
          narrower than a typical V6 and shorter than a straight six. In
          fact, it‚Äôs more comparable in size to a four-cylinder than a
          six, which meant it could slot easily into a Golf floorpan. A
          creative and borderline ingenious engineering solution.

        The Atlas' 3.6L VR6 makes 276 hp and 266 lb-ft. of torque.
        Though

        which I suffered for the hard data. My average before resetting
        the odometer for that feat, though, was 14.7mpg. ‚ÄúGood range and
        miles between trips to the gas station are criteria I look for
        in a good car, and the fuel-gulping Atlas rates low in this
        department‚Äù may be the blandest statement of all time, but
        <emphasis>MotorTrend</emphasis> does have a point ‚Äì with the
        same 18.6 gallon fuel tank shared between the four and six
        cylinder models, the latter realistically has 250 miles of range
        between fillups, which is pitiful for a modern vehicle in just
        about any segment.

        So, is the Atlas indeed just a lucrative German prank on
        Americans? If it is, the subtleties are beyond even me. In the
        time since I drove the Atlas last year,
        <link xlink:href="https://www.caranddriver.com/reviews/a31215717/2020-vw-atlas-cross-sport-drive/">Volkswagen
        has unleashed</link> the Atlas Cross Sport on American roads.
        Apparently, it is
        <link xlink:href="https://www.autoweek.com/drives/a31151883/the-2020-volkswagen-atlas-cross-sport-is-the-suv-for-dinks/">the
        ideal SUV for ‚Äúdual incomes, no kids</link>,‚Äù or ‚ÄúDINKS‚Äù
        (surprisingly, not a homophobic slur.)
        <emphasis>MotorTrend</emphasis>, on the other hand, argues the
        ideal buyer has

          It's a straightforward conversion from Atlas to Atlas Cross
          Sport. In the name of perceived sportiness, out goes that most
          minivan of things: the third row of seats.

      <para>
        Normally, I'd be disgusted with such a thing, but from where I'm
        sitting, the Cross Sport <emphasis>appears</emphasis> to be what
        the Atlas should've been all along. The third row seats in my
        example wasn't any more comfortable than that of a 10-year-old
        minivan, so removing them for the sake of the second makes
        perfect sense. According to <emphasis>Car &amp;

        <link xlink:href="https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a29105149/vw-atlas-cross-sport-2020-tech-features/">exclusive

          Instead of getting 20.6 cubic feet of cargo space behind the
          third row in the Atlas, you get 40.3 behind the second row.
          Fold that down and it becomes 77.8 cubic feet to work with.
          And that‚Äôs from an SUV with the same wheelbase as the upcoming
          2021 Atlas at 117.3 inches, yet it is 5.2 inches shorter and
          2.2 inches lower to the ground.

          Once we got the steering fixed, my opinion of the Atlas did
          grow sunnier, though it's still not perfect. Maybe it's not
          fair to compare the driving experience to my previous
          long-term vehicle, the slightly smaller Mazda CX-9, but in my
          opinion the Mazda still sets the ride and handling bar for the
          competitive set. Setting the Mazda aside, if you hop behind
          the wheel of one of the newer competitors like the Kia
          Telluride, there's a noticeable disparity in the refinement in
          ride quality and body control in the Atlas...

        <para>
          Volkswagen traditionally tuned its suspensions closer to the
          European ideal, firm but well-damped, which incidentally made
          even non-enthusiast Volkswagens more pleasant than average to
          drive (with a few recent exceptions). But Volkswagen made a
          conscious decision to soften up the Jetta for American tastes,
          beyond what softening Volkswagen traditionally applied, and it
          seems like this philosophy scaled up to the much larger Atlas.
          Maybe the soft ride impresses on test drives, but a firmer
          setup would likely make life nicer for occupants over the long
          haul.

          The answer is that it‚Äôs neither. It‚Äôs a reflection of what the
          media industry has worried about, and hoped for, and not
          received. But Medium was never something that we would get to
          define. Instead, it‚Äôs turned out to be an endless thought

      <title>You Need a Password Manager</title>
      <para>
        In 2020, password managers are no longer optional for digital
        life. <emphasis role="strong">They are mandatory</emphasis>. If
        you only ever heed a single piece of my advice, ever,
        <emphasis>please</emphasis> make it this one.
        <link xlink:href="https://www.pcmag.com/picks/the-best-password-managers">Most
        password managers available</link> are secure, cross-platform,
        optionally cloud-synced tools that help you generate, store, and
        organize digital credentials. More likely than not, you‚Äôre
        already using one in your favorite browser. On MacOS and iOS,
        Safari is linked to a service called Keychain, which is ‚Äì
        functionally ‚Äì a robust password manager. On signup for a given
        website or service, Safari should prompt you to automatically
        generate secure, complex passwords to store in Keychain.
        Generally, it‚Äôs pretty smart about knowing when it‚Äôs time to
        retrieve the credentials with Touch-ID, but for when it
        <emphasis>isn‚Äôt</emphasis>, you should know
        <link xlink:href="https://support.apple.com/guide/keychain-access/what-is-keychain-access-kyca1083/mac">how
        to manually retrieve passwords from Keychain</link>. If you‚Äôre
        deeply enough embedded into the Mac ecosystem, you can feel free
        to continue to rely on this process as long as you know how to
        help yourself when it fails. I‚Äôm not going to tell you who to
        trust, but I do <emphasis>almost</emphasis> actually believe in
        Apple‚Äôs commitment to securing user data, if only because of the
        way their incentives are aligned (in contrast with those in
        front of data-funded organizations like Google.)

        If you‚Äôre using a Windows Home Machine and/or an Android
        smartphone, I believe it‚Äôs more urgent that you find a
        standalone password management solution immediately. I use a
        gorgeous app called
        <link xlink:href="https://www.enpass.io/">Enpass</link> to store
        all of my passwords as well as my bank credentials, credit
        cards, driver‚Äôs license information, and anything else I might
        need to keep handy, securely. I can use virtually any cloud or
        file-sharing service to keep my ‚Äúvaults‚Äù synced between all of
        my devices: Microsoft OneDrive, Google Drive, Dropbox, iCloud,
        Box, etc, and I also regularly create encrypted local backups
        just in case. I can even <emphasis>share</emphasis> end-to-end
        encrypted credentials with another device or Enpass
        installation. I migrated to Enpass two years ago after using
        <link xlink:href="https://www.consumerreports.org/password-managers/best-password-managers-review-digital-security-privacy-ease-of-use/">1Password</link>
        for nearly 10. It was intuitive and virtually seamless, as such
        things in software tend to be these days, and as a result, I
        haven‚Äôt had to memorize a single password since my adolescence.
        Enpass allows me to create custom login templates for quick
        differentiation when creating new entries as well as picturized
        categories and tags. With one click, even the icon can be pulled
        from a given URL‚Äôs favicon to help keep my vault looking
        visually itemized. It also includes presets for a hundred
        services or so ‚Äì from Google to Wix to Yahoo! Japan.

        self-curation.</emphasis>

      <para>
        <emphasis role="strong">So I am super curious that you mentioned
        Markdown as something that saved you from fiddling your life
        away. Can you go more into that?</emphasis>
      </para>
      <para>
        I started an online magazine four years ago originally on
        WordPress. I thought I knew something about web development, but
        honestly I did not. It ended up becoming a fixation on trying to
        make something <emphasis>technically</emphasis> different from
        what I'd seen done with WordPress, which detracted heavily from
        my Editorial duties over the years. I'm on the OCD spectrum so I
        just couldn't let it go. I spent thousands of hours fiddling
        with different themes and formatting within those themes, and
        what I ended up with was a mess. I would make changes that would
        break old posts, so I'd go back and fix those, only to make more
        changes days/weeks/months later and have to go back again. I'd
        known vaguely about Markdown, but it wasn't until it was
        mentioned in the WordPress dev Slack that I really considered it
        seriously as a way out of what I'd been doing. I realized that
        its inherit limitations were actually very good for me ‚Äì that I
        needed a limited system to constrain my workflow to keep myself
        on task. Finally, in late-2018, I started to convert our old
        content to Markdown and essentially haven't looked back since.
      </para>
      <para>
        <emphasis role="strong">Did it take a while for you to accept
        Markdown's limitations? Was there a turning point for you? Did
        you look for a Markdown plugin on WordPress to help after making
        the change? I imagine there's something like that out
        there.</emphasis>
      </para>
      <para>
        There are third-party plugins, yes, but I believe the new
        WordPress editor now supports
        ‚Äú<link xlink:href="https://wordpress.com/support/wordpress-editor/blocks/markdown-block/">markdown
        blocks</link>,‚Äù which is sortof handy for those who want to
        continue in that direction. The turning point was probably when
        we ran out of money and lost our account with our hosting
        provider. I was left with an old external HD full of old backups
        and an empty domain. I'd already started moving that direction
        within WordPress (largely because of the
        <link xlink:href="https://wptavern.com/wordpress-core-editor-team-publishes-ui-prototype-for-gutenberg-an-experimental-block-based-editor">Gutenberg
        editor project</link>,) but losing the site in its entirety was
        what I really needed to push us into a more modern, progressive
        CMS. Honestly, Markdown is capable of everything we
        <emphasis>actually</emphasis> need and nothing more. I'd like to
        think I was able to realize this from the beginning.
      </para>
      <para>
        <emphasis role="strong">So you're left with an old external HD
        full of old backups and an empty domain. Talk to me about the
        process then of finding that modern, progressive CMS. Did you
        have a vague idea of what you were looking for? I imagine
        getting those backups ready for whatever you were going to
        choose as another process entirely.</emphasis>
      </para>
      <para>
        I actually decided to ditch the backups and just move forward
        with a different Editorial direction (the project has since been
        more or less put on hiatus.) I knew Markdown had to be involved
        and that I never wanted to look at anything like WordPress'
        dashboard ever again. I played around with a local Ghost
        instance but just didn't <emphasis>feel</emphasis> anything for
        it, if that makes sense. I'd already moved my
        <link xlink:href="http://bilge.world">personal blog</link> to
        Write.As months before and eventually realized that it was just
        what
        <link xlink:href="http://extratone"><emphasis>Extratone</emphasis></link>
        needed ‚Äì so far, I've only imported my own contributions and the
        most recent work from others.
      </para>
      <para>
        <emphasis role="strong">Could you explain what you mean by
        <emphasis>feeling</emphasis> something for a piece of software?
        I noticed this in your
        <link xlink:href="https://bilge.world/poweruser-tips-software-shortcuts">recent
        post</link> on your personal blog and what I enjoyed about it so
        much. There's an enthusiasm about the software you do recommend
        that jumps through the screen. I want to use
        <link xlink:href="https://bear.app/">Bear</link> after reading
        your post.</emphasis>
      </para>
      <para>
        I'm glad to hear that! I suppose it dates back to my upbringing
        on a farm in rural Missouri, where I felt a real affection for ‚Äì
        and attachment to ‚Äì our tractors, combine, and such. When one
        cares about their work, I think it's inevitable for them to be
        emotionally invested in the tools they use to accomplish it
        every day. During my brief stint in IT in the beginning of 2019,
        I saw a lot of users struggling with outdated and ridiculously
        unintuitive software throughout their entire workday and it made
        me really appreciate the idea of ‚Äúgood workflow.‚Äù I'm not really
        a developer, but I believe software can always be better because
        I've seen it. As an End User of sorts with not much cash, I feel
        like my main contribution back to developers should be
        celebrating their good work. This is an idea I feel I do not
        encounter enough in day-to-day life.
      </para>
      <para>
        <emphasis role="strong">As someone who also had a brief stint in
        IT, I totally agree with the struggles people go through because
        of outdated &amp; unintuitive software. But IT also made me
        realize how much of software is personal ‚Äî someone will want a
        solution that's unintuitive to you but is intuitive to them. You
        learn a lot of empathy from that.</emphasis>
      </para>
      <para>
        <emphasis role="strong">I am intrigued by your last point there
        ‚Äî why don't you think you encounter the idea of celebrating
        software developers enough in day-to-day life?</emphasis>
      </para>
      <para>
        I suppose specifically I mean I don't see enough celebration of
        <emphasis>good</emphasis> development. It's hard to challenge
        the personal workflow of anyone, yes, but I hope folks will
        continue to want to better their lives with new solutions. As I
        mentioned in my Tips post, Microsoft Word is a great specific
        example of software that simply
        <link xlink:href="https://slate.com/technology/2012/04/microsoft-word-is-cumbersome-inefficient-and-obsolete-its-time-for-it-to-die.html"><emphasis>should
        not</emphasis> be used anymore</link> ‚Äì especially in
        composition for The Web. Not that Word is
        <emphasis>celebrated</emphasis>, necessarily, but
        <emphasis role="strong">its alternatives are not</emphasis>. It
        should be noted that I have no specific authority in this matter
        other than years of experience with ‚Äì and enjoyment of ‚Äì playing
        around with software. I just think that End Users deserve better
        than they get, and awareness of new/different software is a huge
        part of the problem. Making average people aware of better
        solutions should be the primary function of special interest
        tech journalism, IMO.
      </para>
      <para>
        <emphasis role="strong">Great point about Microsoft Word. I
        don't even remember the last time I seriously used it ‚Äî high
        school maybe? And like you said, discovery can be an issue to
        the adoption of these alternative tools. So are there any common
        patterns you've noticed as to how you've come about these
        software alternatives that you now use? Patterns that someone
        could adopt?</emphasis>
      </para>
      <para>
        It's not that I slave away, but it does take a lot of time to
        discover them. The simple answer is: I drink a lot of caffeine
        and hyperfixate on the internet. I'm not sure it's something the
        average user should <emphasis>want</emphasis> to adopt, but if
        they do, they should be
        <link xlink:href="http://joinmastodon.org">on Mastodon</link>.
        They should be googling ‚Äúalternatives to...‚Äù regularly, and they
        should worship Free and Open Source Software. Accepting that you
        never have to settle for one piece of software is probably the
        beginning. For lack of a better term, I just love
        <emphasis>playing around</emphasis> with software. That's not
        something I would advocate for my old clients or other End Users
        ‚Äì I would rather find out myself and then present a list of
        alternatives in an entertaining way. I hope that's an
        appropriate and sufficient answer hehe.
      </para>
      <para>
        <emphasis role="strong">No that's great! The acceptance of never
        having to settle for one piece of software is at once valuable
        and challenging to adopt. If you keep switching you could be a
        sort of software vagabond who throws their data into a rucksack
        to head to the next viable platform. I've always had trouble
        trying to find the proper balance between playing around with
        software &amp; learning a tool well enough that it can be
        useful. How have you personally navigated that? I could imagine
        your foray into &amp; out of Wordpress as an example.</emphasis>
      </para>
      <para>
        It's always a challenge when trying new things. I obsess over
        different ways to accomplish tasks. I've probably signed
        <emphasis>Extratone</emphasis> for 15 different newsletter
        services (including
        <link xlink:href="http://buttondown.email">Buttondown</link>
        today) though I haven't actually written a single edition of our
        newsletter in nearly two years. I think it's only recently that
        I've been able to look at these habits from a reasonable
        perspective. As in, I am now able to finally differentiate
        between playing and being productive, but it took some 15 years.
        Self-awareness of one's actual progress is key. Asking questions
        like <emphasis>why am I actually doing this ‚Äì for profit or for
        play?</emphasis> Differentiating between these two is something
        someone like me will always struggle with, I think.
      </para>
      <para>
        <emphasis role="strong">The distinction between playing and
        being productive can be quite blurry. I sometimes find that
        playing around with a piece of software can lead to a productive
        use of it. How about you? Did you start with the idea of
        creating <emphasis>Extratone</emphasis> first and then tried to
        find the right software to fit the job? Or did you start playing
        around with Wordpress and then the idea of the digital
        publication took form soon after?</emphasis>
      </para>
      <para>
        That's an insightful supposition. I actually tried to launch an
        online magazine before <emphasis>Extratone</emphasis> with
        virtually zero editorial focus along with a standalone podcast
        that I'd been hosting on WordPress for years. I originally began
        playing around with WordPress sites in my early adolescence, so
        you could say it all culminated in the idea. It took maturity to
        realize that I actually wanted to build a platform for
        <emphasis>other</emphasis> voices rather than continue to invest
        in my own. I'd like to believe that was all enabled by the
        playing hehe.
      </para>
      <para>
        <emphasis role="strong">So what lead you to the conclusion of
        building a platform for other voices? Especially curious from
        the <emphasis>maturity</emphasis> angle. Because you still have
        a <link xlink:href="https://bilge.world/">personal blog</link>,
        so it doesn't feel like you've completely neglected your
        personal voice. But would you consider that as not the same
        investment of time &amp; effort that you'd put into something
        like <emphasis>Extratone</emphasis>?</emphasis>
      </para>
      <para>
        I should be clear that I have <emphasis>not</emphasis>
        accomplished what I set out to do with
        <emphasis>Extratone</emphasis>. After a fairly big personal
        trauma in 2015, I had a bit of an existential crisis and
        realized that I had surrounded myself with so many talented (in
        a particularly relevant way) online friends who were producing
        all sorts of incredible content ‚Äì music and videos, mostly. I
        realized that I was better at editing and other platform duties
        than I was at writing, and that perhaps the online communities I
        was astride could be provided a single banner to give
        themselves. In that sense, I haven't figured out how to do what
        I set out to yet. Ideally, my byline would be completely gone
        from <emphasis>Extratone</emphasis>, so I've more or less put it
        on hold until I figure out how to accomplish that. Turning it
        into a somewhat profitable media company is still my biggest
        long-term life goal.
      </para>
      <para>
        <emphasis role="strong">The curatorial characteristic you
        describe is underrated, even though the ‚Äúeveryone is a curator‚Äù
        idea is jammed down our throats all the time. There's something
        about this curation on a person-to-person level that still has
        lots of room for experimentation. On that subject, do you have
        any examples of communities, sites, or models that guide where
        you'd want <emphasis>Extratone</emphasis> to go?</emphasis>
      </para>
      <para>
        My citable aspirations in that regard have been somewhat
        superficial, I'm afraid. From a technical perspective, I really
        admired what Joshua Topolsky was
        <link xlink:href="https://www.niemanlab.org/2016/08/newsonomics-sketching-in-the-details-of-josh-topolskys-new-outline/">trying
        to do</link> with
        <link xlink:href="http://theoutline.com"><emphasis>The
        Outline</emphasis></link> ‚Äì which just
        <link xlink:href="https://www.niemanlab.org/2020/04/the-outline-an-attempt-to-build-a-bolder-kind-of-news-site-appears-to-have-met-its-end/">closed
        this month</link>, actually. They built their own CMS including
        a bespoke advertising delivery platform which really looked
        <emphasis>great</emphasis> but they just
        <link xlink:href="https://www.niemanlab.org/2018/10/the-outline-built-itself-on-being-weird-but-is-it-weird-enough-to-survive/">couldn't
        figure out</link> a sustainable editorial focus. In my fantasy
        world, I have the connections and digital media insight of
        Topolsky and know how to apply them in a way that supports
        <emphasis>our</emphasis> community because I don't see any one
        brand popping up any substantial umbrellas over the electronic
        musicians I know. (It wasn't until ‚Äútoo late‚Äù that I realized
        <emphasis>Extratone</emphasis>'s sole editorial focus should
        have been electronic music all along.) I read a lot about media
        but I'm pretty picky as far as hero worship goes when it comes
        to my own professional goals. I once promised that
        <emphasis>Extratone</emphasis> would <emphasis>never</emphasis>
        run ads, so I could see some sort of non-profit classification
        working out in our future. I believe I could be an excellent
        curator ‚Äì I'm just not quite sure how to get there yet.
      </para>
      <para>
        <emphasis role="strong">I think you're a great curator ‚Äî had to
        ask that question of influence because I think you have a unique
        curatorial presence on the web. Just saw you tweet about
        <link xlink:href="https://www.tractordata.com/">tractordata.com</link>.
        Who else would recommend that? Love it. That's why I thought
        <link xlink:href="https://are.na/">Are.na</link> would be right
        up your alley.</emphasis>
      </para>
      <para>
        <emphasis role="strong">So you emphasized
        ‚Äú<emphasis>our</emphasis> community‚Äù there ‚Äî what do you define
        as your community in that broader context?</emphasis>
      </para>
      <para>
        Well thank you! That's a question I'm still struggling to
        define. <emphasis role="strong">Electronic music</emphasis> is
        about as far as I've gotten. I met most of my talented friends
        on Twitter over the past 10 years or so and have tried to
        contain them in a
        <link xlink:href="https://twitter.com/i/lists/1032269790616858625">list</link>
        before. There are innate challenges in defining such a creative
        community ‚Äì I have done my best to label without being
        constricting, but it's definitely difficult trying to figure out
        how to provide a flag which everyone feels comfortable flying. I
        still think the best I've done to articulate what I'm trying to
        say was for
        <link xlink:href="https://extratone.com/about"><emphasis>Extratone</emphasis>'s
        About page</link>. Most of the folks I'm talking about are used
        to hustling their own brand so it's been a real challenge
        working on the right way to reach out.
      </para>
      <para>
        <emphasis role="strong">A flag which everyone feels comfortable
        flying ‚Äî that's a great way to put it. What I find interesting
        about your internet presence is that you defy the idea of flying
        just a single flag. Along with <emphasis>Extratone</emphasis>
        you have
        <link xlink:href="https://anchor.fm/extratone">multiple</link>

      </para>
      <para>
        <emphasis role="strong">I've been thinking a lot lately about
        how important it is to have many online buckets to put your
        ideas in. One just feels too limiting, especially if it's solely
        linked to your legal identity. How do you think about this
        matter of identity &amp; expression with your own online
        presence?</emphasis>
      </para>
      <para>
        That's a very good question. I can't take credit for

        actually ‚Äì I'm not sure who created that server but it's
        administered by an account called

        You've arrived at another one of my biggest challenges.
        Consolidating my interests has always been a problem, especially
        on The Web. Age has definitely helped narrow them down a bit,
        but I still can't help myself sometimes. I think it's ended up
        alienating a lot of my followers on social because I have a hard
        time posting just within my niche(s). I'm not so sure how to
        feel about this, honestly. One could argue that I should post
        whatever I want, whenever, but <emphasis>consider your
        audience</emphasis> is also a concept I can no longer ignore. If
        anything, I need to learn to let myself be limited a bit
        <emphasis>more</emphasis> by those buckets. Once again,
        <emphasis>Extratone</emphasis> is a good example of this ‚Äì I
        should've never published app reviews there, but I did. We're
        all learning, I suppose.
      </para>
      <para>
        <emphasis role="strong">Do you feel like you have to even learn
        to limit yourself on your
        <link xlink:href="https://bilge.world/">personal blog</link>? It
        seems like a personal blog can act as the release valve ‚Äî a way
        of getting around cornering yourself into the niches that
        <emphasis>Extratone</emphasis> and other projects require. You
        can freely write about
        <link xlink:href="https://bilge.world/preferred-writing-instruments">pens</link>
        and
        <link xlink:href="https://bilge.world/star-trek-picard-review">Picard</link>
        without feeling constrained to a single subject.</emphasis>
      </para>
      <para>
        I think I'm just now coming around to understanding personal
        blogging and the freedom that entails. It's been a long while
        since I've had the urge to write about things on which I don't
        consider myself at least somewhat of an authority. I think ‚Äì
        like many people ‚Äì I originally just used my personal blog as a
        guinea pig for messing around with themes, and I'm just now
        actually catching up on some of the lesser items on my
        ‚Äúto-write‚Äù list. Since we've begun talking I've begun building
        my blogs bookmark folder back up and following the
        <link xlink:href="https://100daystooffload.com/"></link><link xlink:href="https://bilge.world/tag:100DaystoOffload" role="hashtag">#100DaystoOffload</link></a>
        challenge, which I find immensely impressive. I can't say I'm
        quite up to it, personally, but I definitely plan on opening up
        the taps a bit more. (I also don't want to flood
        <link xlink:href="https://read.write.as/">read.write.as</link>
        with too many joke posts ya know hehe.)
      </para>
      <para>
        <emphasis role="strong">That's awesome! You're reminding me of
        the interesting relationship between writing &amp; tinkering
        when it comes to blogs. They both feed into each other in a
        strange way. Before, when my blog was on Wordpress, I didn't
        care about tinkering around ‚Äî writing was my sole focus. When I
        moved to my new blog, however, I found myself shift towards
        creating apps that extend my blog and messing around with its
        CSS. So it's interesting that you've gone the opposite way,
        publishing more instead of solely tinkering.</emphasis>

        That is interesting. I'm wondering how many people are in each

        being home constantly has definitely contributed. I've also
        begun to learn to let things go, which is an essential skill.
        Being able to actually kill work when it needs to die is the
        real secret. I just built up the strength to delete the rest of
        my 2019 list a few weeks ago.

        recently as ideas for blog posts start to pile up.</emphasis>

      <para>
        Self-curation is definitely tough. Generally, it's very hard to
        let things go ‚Äì especially when I've progressed at all
        significantly into research/first drafting, but I know when to
        kill something if I reread and am unable to immediately see
        where I was going. I've noticed that trying to rekindle interest
        or momentum in a topic is unusually not a worthwhile use of time
        in my case. If I can't get my rhythm back fairly early in, I am
        very unlikely to, ever. That said, I think it's also important
        to <emphasis>forgive yourself</emphasis> for investing time in
        something that won't work out ‚Äì otherwise, you will settle for

        Though I grew up on a farm surrounded by (and loving) diesel
        equipment, owning a diesel-powered automobile somehow never
        occurred to me. This is especially puzzling given the
        overwhelmingly positive experience I was privileged to have with
        one 2014 Volkswagen Jetta TDI Sportwagen over the past year. It
        would find me signing up to Facebook groups, using real Fast Boy
        terms, revisiting long-lost roads of home, and returning to my
        local community in an extremely intimate ridesharing stint.
        Throughout it all, the Jetta made me smile much
        <emphasis>much</emphasis> more than I would‚Äôve thought. I found
        a real love for this relatively simpleton form of transportation
        that I <emphasis>should</emphasis> have seen coming, but did not
        at all. There is something delightfully indulgent about a
        manual-equipped diesel wagon. Even

        central Missouri to Des Moines to Chicago to Kansas City and

          size, high-quality interior, new rear suspension, and refined
          demeanor as evidence that the Jetta had moved out of the Honda

        Jetta‚Äôs name before reading anything about it. When an American

        When I began searching for my first ever truly modern car in

        another, high-mileage Sportwagen, but I was committed to getting

        Three of us walked into a dealership in the middle of a frigid
        Kansas afternoon ‚Äì Jack, my girlfriend Sierra, and I. We hovered
        by a smart, gleaming little Golf GTI whilst my salesman,
        Charles, retrieved the car I had found online. After he finished
        copying my driver‚Äôs license while the little diesel warmed up,
        the four of us set off into suburban Lawrence. Back when the Mk.
        VI Golf was released, I attended a Volkswagen dealership event
        in which Mk. V and Mk. VI GTIs were driven back-to-back ‚Äì I‚Äôm
        assuming to reassure buyers that yes, they <emphasis>really
        had</emphasis> made it better (though I was quite vocal in my
        disagreement about this, to the dealer‚Äôs chagrin.) The car I
        bought immediately reminded me more of the former ‚Äì perhaps I
        just enjoy the increased body roll of a 50,000+ mile suspension
        ‚Äì albeit with a much longer wheelbase and significantly more
        torque. Rowing through the gears, I was immediately impressed
        and bewildered by the characteristics of the 140-horsepower, 236
        lb.-ft.-developing diesel powerplant. The diesel engines I grew
        up around in tractors, combines, and other heavy machinery were
        designed to more or less remain at a constant, relatively low
        RPM for the majority of their use cases. It‚Äôs not a screamer,
        but the idea that a diesel engine can <emphasis>rev</emphasis>
        at all was something that took a bit to wrap my head around.
        However, it is almost immediately evident that carrying on to
        the 6000 RPM (?) redline is a futile and incorrect practice.
        There is nothing at all to be found up there.

        I‚Äôve driven some quick straight-line cars in my time, but none
        of them have delivered their power anything like the Jetta‚Äôs
        long-distinguished 2.0L inline-four. It‚Äôs very odd having
        comparatively so little actual horsepower, yet so much torque ‚Äì
        I‚Äôd heard Jeremy Clarkson complain about diesel power coming in
        ‚Äúgreat lumps,‚Äù but I‚Äôd already started to find them extremely
        (and positively) amusing in my first few minutes. When asked,
        the oil burner will produce protracted front tire squeal and
        torque steer from a stop, which is odd and hilarious coming from
        such an otherwise docile automobile. Also hilarious: Charles
        likely noted that Jack, Sierra, and I were (and are) entirely
        unafraid of facing The End when a very near collision during our
        test drive did not perturb us in the least, but left him huffing
        and puffing from adrenaline. He was a star, though, throughout
        the more than four hours of deliberations required for his
        institution to reckon with my credit history. Eventually, I
        ended up spending almost exactly $12,000, which was probably too

        Somewhere North of Kansas City, I opened the taps all the way on

        used to be the accepted number, 70 (the actual speed limit) was

        All of the cars I‚Äôve owned have been attention-grabbing in their
        own way ‚Äì my old Toyota pickup was adored by the locals; my
        Miata was adored by other Miata owners. My XJR was gorgeous and
        my Swamp Continental seemed to be passionately coveted by
        absolutely everyone over 40. With the Jetta, though, I did not
        expect any unusual attention whatsoever, yet I must confess that
        more conversations were started about it than of all of the
        others, combined. Ridesharing will do that, yes, but it is
        ridiculous how many people of all races, classes, and ages were

        Early one morning, a ride was requested from the local news
        station just out of town ‚Äì a fascinating place. News vans parked
        in a converted horse stable. They farm televisions out there. A
        few minutes into the ride, after picking up the young woman, I
        noticed in the rearview mirror out of my eye‚Äôs corner that she
        had put down her phone to watch my right hand with total
        bewilderment. Eventually, she asked ‚Äúwhat are you doing to the
        car?‚Äù She‚Äôd never heard of a manual transmission before. I did
        my best to explain, but when she asked ‚Äúbut why wouldn‚Äôt you
        just buy a regular car?‚Äù I did not have a sufficient answer.
        Unlike many automotive enthusiasts, I think it‚Äôs totally okay
        that people are allowed to exist independent of this knowledge.
        There are many, many other things in life to worry about.

        While we‚Äôre on the topic of manual transmissions, it‚Äôs relevant
        to mention how excellent the Jetta TDI is as a vehicle to teach
        first timers how to operate one. With the clutch in, the engine
        will not rev beyond 3500 RPM thanks to an electronic limiter,
        which dramatically reduces the number of obligatory stalls when
        learning clutch control. The learner can simply hold the
        accelerator to the floor as they get the hang of declutching
        instead of having to receive shouts of ‚Äúmore gas!‚Äù repeatedly.
        Of course, being a diesel further eases those stresses with much
        more readily available torque. Sierra was able to grasp the
        basics this way in a <emphasis>single night</emphasis>, which is
        unprecedented in my experience. She found particular comfort in
        the suggested gear indicator on the instrument panel‚Äôs main
        information display, which is very conservative, naturally, but
        also apparently relief from some great anxiety regarding the
        question <emphasis>which gear should I be in right

        better. The issue these products are combatting is the
        particularly disconnected gearshift which Volkswagen has been
        notorious for the past few decades. The best way I can describe
        it is that it feels like you‚Äôre just operating a lever instead
        of shifting a transmission, if that makes sense.

          spent more consecutive time driving the Jetta than I have in
          any other automobile and was able to truly enjoy it. After my

        I have no idea why I signed up to attend Microsoft's virtual
        2020 Build Conference, but I did. I thought I'd add my
        <link xlink:href="https://anchor.fm/davidblue">End User</link>
        commentary to the mix. Sorry. My first event was called ‚ÄúEvery
        developer is welcome, with Scott Hanselman and guests.‚Äù
        Hanselman is listed as a
        <link xlink:href="https://www.hanselman.com/">blogger</link> and
        <link xlink:href="http://hanselminutes.com">podcaster</link>
        living (of course) in Portland. I'm not a ‚Äúreal‚Äù developer, but
        I know what Microsoft Teams is, and I recognized the event as a
        desktop screenshare of his calls with different Microsoft
        employees. There was a
        <link xlink:href="https://twitter.com/JuanKRuiz/status/1262789374128816128">child
        invasion</link> and a dropped phone. I also noticed the icon for
        the
        <link xlink:href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/meet-the-new-microsoft-edge-your-move-google/">‚Äúnew‚Äù
        Microsoft Edge</link> browser in his taskbar and realized that I
        hadn't downloaded it yet. I remedied that for the conference's
        sake ‚Äì I thought it only appropriate that I try to use as much
        Microsoft software as possible in this context. I also installed
        the new

      <para>
        As an Office 365 administrator, I basically only use Edge for
        administrative/management tasks. Otherwise, I can't imagine a
        reason to use it over Firefox, Brave, Vivaldi, Chrome, Opera,
        etc, but I thought I'd give the ‚Äúnew‚Äù (as of January) Edge a
        tryout for your sake and make it my default browser for a day as
        well as Microsoft's Bing search engine. There's also news
        specific to Build:
        <link xlink:href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/19/microsoft-edge-gets-a-pinterest-integration-sidebar-search-and-automatic-profile-switching/">Edge
        is integrating with Pinterest</link>, of all things:
      </para>
      <blockquote>
        <para>
          Now, Edge will feature a Pinterest-powered tool that will show
          suggestions from Pinterest at the bottom of a collection.
          Clicking on that, Microsoft says, will take users to a
          Pinterest board ‚Äúof similar, trending Pins so users can
          quickly find and add ideas relevant to their collection.‚Äù
          Users will also be able to export collections to Pinterest.
        </para>
      </blockquote>
      <para>
        I'm in no position to ‚Äútest‚Äù a browser, but the new Edge is
        noticeably faster at rendering pages and much
        <emphasis>much</emphasis> smoother when navigating between
        tabs/preference windows. It looks much more like Chrome, which
        makes sense. Perhaps because my install is absent of third-party
        extensions, opening new tabs and windows was much faster than my
        other browsers. I recorded a
        <link xlink:href="https://vimeo.com/420430704">~2 minute
        demo</link> of normal browsing on
        <link xlink:href="https://extratone.com/microsoft-surface-laptop-2-review-windows-future">my

      </para>
      <para>
        In terms of touch support, Edge remains the only acceptable
        browser on Windows 10. If you've spent money on a new PC
        recently, chances are your device is touch-enabled. If you're
        like me, you've already
        <link xlink:href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4028019/windows-enable-and-disable-your-touchscreen-in-windows-10">disabled
        it</link>. If not, you'll find scrolling and navigation in Edge
        have improved tremendously ‚Äì it's like an entirely new browser

        it is</link>.
      </para>
      <blockquote>
        <para>
          Because Edge used a different rendering engine than Chrome or
          Safari, it meant that it would sometimes have problems on
          websites. Testing a website against multiple browsers has
          always been difficult, and because Edge had so little uptake,
          it meant optimizing for it often fell off the priority list
          for web developers.
        </para>
      </blockquote>
      <para>
        I really like how easy it is to mute audio from tabs and how
        much better <link xlink:href="https://write.as">my CMS</link> is
        rendered. I still prefer Firefox's method of tab switching (by
        last-used chronologically instead of in the order presented.)
        The reader view is smoother than its competitors and offers a
        beautiful selection of themes as well as the best ‚ÄúRead aloud‚Äù
        feature in the business.

        Chromium is using more RAM than Firefox but a bit less than
        Chrome. <link xlink:href="http://office.com">Office.com</link>
        also looks and works incredibly well. Overall, I'm extremely
        impressed with Edge Chromium and the improvements to Bing. As of
        my experiences today, it's the fastest and smoothest web browser
        I have, which is a complete flip from that of the old Edge.

        boarding the same redeye flight to Boston ‚Äì American Pride
        Flight 29. This group falls asleep and mysteriously wakes up
        alone on the aircraft except for Stephen King himself (Dean
        Stockwell,) a stupid incel violinist (Christopher Collet,) and a
        stoner (Kimber Riddle.) My favorite character, Craig Toomey, is
        the ‚Äútwerp‚Äù business boy with daddy issues who can't stop
        himself from demanding to know what's going on. James Bond shuts
        him up with a ‚Äúnose hold.‚Äù

        David Morse proceeds to try and contact air traffic control in a
        fairly-realistic manner, but is unable to receieve any radio
        signals at all, even from Strategic Air Command. Frankie Faison
        plays the single person of color on the flight, Don Gaffney ‚Äì ‚Äúa
        tool and die worker for Hughes Aircraft‚Äù ‚Äì who dies first, of
        course. James Bond lecures David about inciting panic and almost

      <title>Why Extratone has used Discord instead of Slack for our

      <para>
        Back in 2015, I hosted a pre-<emphasis>Extratone</emphasis>

        <link xlink:href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2zjkrB28csR68YoY1M1eSk"><emphasis>Drycast</emphasis></link>
        with musician friends from all over the net. To record remotely,
        we originally used Teamspeak 3 ‚Äì a gamer VoIP staple. When I
        discovered Discord, I thought we'd found podcasting heaven.
        Originally, the free plan included 128kbps audio in its voice
        channels, which was nearly twice what we were getting out of our
        <emphasis>paid</emphasis> Teamspeak server. If I were still
        podcasting, Discord's

        poll I ran on Twitter</link>, 2/3rds of all people on Earth are
        thankful for Discord's existence. This is not surprising
        considering what every Discord user is still offered without
        spending any money at all: community spaces with audio/video and
        text chat capability, organizable by Twitch and
        YouTube-integrated roles with a plethora of different permission
        options, instantly and easily shareable by customizable
        temporary or permanent invite links through an application
        that's about as cross-platform as one can get (Windows, Mac,
        Linux, Android, iOS, or simply one's web browser.) Those of us

        Never before have so many VoIP, video, and text chat features
        been offered together, or in such a beautiful package. ‚ÄúWhat we
        really did was create an all-in-one voice, video, and text chat
        app that replaced this constellation of tools that people would
        use,‚Äù said CEO Jason Citron in
        <link xlink:href="https://youtu.be/NNJ2n6XKmmA">an interview
        with CNBC</link>. Technically in terms of these details, Discord
        <emphasis>has no competition</emphasis>. Slack offers text and
        voice chat with its paid plans, yes, but nothing close in terms
        of video ‚Äì especially considering

        users to stream game video directly to 10 other users in the
        server. With some jury-rigging, it's possible to simply screen
        share this way, which is an essential sell for business video
        communication applications like Skype.

        <link xlink:href="https://www.twitch.tv/layriena">Layiena</link>‚Äôs
        streams are incredible because ‚Äì while he understands theory as
        well as the other broadcasters in the STO Twitch community ‚Äì
        it‚Äôs his incredible skills at live Captain commentary (calling
        out abilities and other command inputs as if he really is in the
        captain‚Äôs chair.) It may sound cringey (and perhaps it would be
        to many,) but his thoroughness and accuracy actually 1) make it
        seem pretty darn cool to me and 2) are hugely valuable in
        helping the viewer understand what he‚Äôs doing. After some three
        years, I know my one rotation fairly well, but only three or
        four of its steps by name ‚Äì not even remotely well enough to do
        what he does. Unfortunately, it appears as though he‚Äôs been
        inactive since last year.

        streams also have an especially professional feel ‚Äì he is
        excellent at calling out his actions as well, if perhaps without
        so much intensity. His Norwegian sensibility is wonderful: when
        I introduced myself as being around in the community since 2008,
        he remarked ‚Äúthat‚Äôs strange considering the game has only been
        out since 2010.‚Äù Nigh-universally common threads among them:
        imperturbable kindness to their audience and an impressively
        wholesome commitment to <emphasis>actually having
        fun</emphasis>. Though I‚Äôm far from deeply saturated with Twitch
        culture as a whole, I‚Äôve watched my fair share of <emphasis>Eve

        <emphasis>Gran Turismo Sport</emphasis> streams, and ‚Äì while all
        of these have incredible communities ‚Äì there‚Äôs none quite like
        the sincerity of the <emphasis>Star Trek</emphasis> fraternity.

        In the right hour, the woodland springtime metamorphic processes
        of the neighboring Lake Geneva suburb‚Äôs in-betweens were in a
        paused state ‚Äì the toads again hushed; the crickets tired, and
        the human populace, too. In the right hour, the fickle wind and
        the social owls were the only sound, and nothing moved but the
        sparse, light-footed doe in careful segments with her fawn. From
        the main gated lane of <emphasis>The Nice, Huge
        Estate</emphasis>, Lenny Lather slid through the muddy barrier
        and started bouncing West on the blacktop, brogues squeaking
        every third step. The overcasted clouds were having trouble
        deciding whether or not to let down their rain ‚Äì as they had
        been all day ‚Äì and the old, heavy early-March mist softened the
        yellow glow of the tall, buzzing streetlamps so much that he
        couldn‚Äôt help but intermittently wipe his eyes, for the
        spreading light convinced his mind that his eyelashes must‚Äôve

        Theodore Pith‚Äôs big old house was now burrowed between two

        its development‚Äôs clear-cutting and contained within one of its
        central featureless backyards an unidentifiable creature which
        made all through the night the most unimaginably ghastly,
        disturbingly human child-like shrieking; the opposing Westerly‚Äôs
        trees further enough along in their regrowth ‚Äì ten or twenty
        years perhaps ‚Äì to appear more of the planet Earth to
        Manhattan-bred Lenny Lather, who still found the colorless
        destruction of suburbia unendingly upsetting, especially when
        coming down. In the interest of his regular withdrawal‚Äôs
        mitigation, he had already established two short, repeatable
        tracks and a longer, several mile-long loop which skirted him
        sufficiently around the East‚Äôs center to avoid hearing the
        shrieks in all but the stillest nights. Never in his years ‚Äì on
        these walks he was <emphasis>especially</emphasis> reminded of
        just how many there were ‚Äì had he been able to feel such
        absolute ownership of his surroundings. The eroding Earth
        slipping away from the hem of the warped, stained wood fences;
        the sidewalks, cracked, bent, sloped helter-skelter, often
        muddied in the troughs and joints ‚Äì generally laying haphazardly
        in layers after having been steadily tossed about by the glacial
        forces of their intermixture with clay, precipitation, and the
        tumultuous temperature-dependent torture of the two ‚Äì these were
        his, entirely, in the right hour. Between two and five in the
        morning when the earliest risers would blearily revive their
        dewy automobiles from long, silent hibernation, the whole world
        ‚Äì everything in his sight and more at any moment ‚Äì it was all

        In the right hour, the roads were completely and totally
        abandoned ‚Äì for the New Yorker, an unfathomable absolute ‚Äì and
        all humanity was at rest. In the right hour, Lenny Lather was
        the appointed guardian of the worn domesticity of a small
        nation, though the lonely occupation was astoundingly lax, for
        in the miles and miles of empty streets he had already traversed
        in his nightly holidays from the World of Pith, he had yet to
        encounter a single unexpected factor or minutely threatening
        presence. Since shortly after his December arrival, he‚Äôd walked
        through even the most frigid mornings. Of course, the stillness
        had then been <emphasis>even more</emphasis> otherworldly, and
        Lenny was curious to see how his new most private domain would
        change with the seasons. Though the auxiliary guest room which
        he now called home was no smaller or less hospitable than the
        master bedroom of his late Hudson Yards flat shared with his
        late Wife, it proved to be a poor respite from Theodore Pith,
        who treated him ‚Äì when they were ‚Äúhome‚Äù at <emphasis>Nice,
        Huge</emphasis> ‚Äì as the puppy he never had, and expected his
        participation to remain entirely vulnerable to his any whim.
        Granted ‚Äì in their shared abuse of amphetamines, cocaine, and
        assorted other stimulants ‚Äì Lenny Lather was vastly more
        prepared for the games than any circadian guest could‚Äôve
        possibly been. At first, the ten-foot door of his dawn-facing
        room had closed without latching, but with the warmth and
        moisture brought with the Midwestern Spring, the most secure
        state in which the engorged wood could be forcibly arranged
        still left a half-inch crack, and Lather‚Äôs last chance of
        privacy was lost.

        a single Butler (much less an entire household staff) was
        proving extremely difficult for him ‚Äì Lenny Lather was the sole
        pick of the draft. In the earliest hours of one Tuesday morning
        in February, he‚Äôd been pleasantly dosing and drooling on his
        laptop after an evening of obsessive, incoherent notetaking when
        the huge door had been kicked ajar by a deep black, blindingly
        shiny oxford with excessively violent force. Attached to the
        shoe in an equally blinding penguin tuxedo, towering bowler hat,
        and cartoonish fake mustache was the Great, Blown Pith.

        ‚ÄúHope you‚Äôre not busy,‚Äù he‚Äôd said quite loudly to the lolling

        untangling its chain.

        ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not <emphasis>busy</emphasis>, are ya?!‚Äù he‚Äôd shouted,

        against the vanity‚Ä¶ then swatting it with a flicking wrist‚Ä¶ then
        clubbing it with a full, two-handed homerun swing ‚Äì taking huge,
        vaguely cat nose-shaped gouges from the surface of the wood. The
        splintery wood chips had rained down upon the hunched Lenny;
        he‚Äôd stirred with one found its way in his open mouth ‚Äì he‚Äôd
        chewed it slowly and swallowed it, but he still had not awoken.
        Nevertheless, Theodore Pith‚Äôs coked-up enthusiasm couldn‚Äôt

        Unable to form a linguistic response, Lenny Lather had obeyed

        marginal, arrested clarity at how well-tailored it was for him.
        He had not the soundness of perception to protest when Pith had
        whipped a deep black, blindingly shiny bowtie around his
        already-congested esophagus, nor when he‚Äôd adheased the huge,
        itchy matching fake moustache to his upper lip and nearly pulled
        the matching Tower of Bowler all the way down over his ears. He
        had been unresponsive when he‚Äôd been sat on the bench under the
        agonizing fluorescent lights of the laundry room, affixed with
        deep black, blindingly shiny matching oxfords, and asked if he
        smoked and how well he could say <emphasis>guffaw.</emphasis>

        Lenny Lather had not‚Ä¶ <emphasis>could not</emphasis> have made a
        sound through the confusing nonsense of his waking pre-Great
        Depression dream, but when the old servant‚Äôs door had been
        opened before him and set the heartless, single-digit Winter
        wind upon his very soul, he had all at once arrived in the
        world, laughing and whooping together with Theodore Pith.

      <para>
        ‚ÄúJesus <emphasis>Christ!</emphasis>‚Äù he‚Äôd screamed as they‚Äôd
        hobbled to the stable, where a devilishly dark red Model J
        Duesenberg had sat shivering in a rough idle, staring out the
        retrofitted garage door with its basketball-sized lights as if
        it was, indeed, a flesh-and-blood steed that had just been
        frightened awake by a thunderstorm, but the sky had been as
        clear as it would‚Äôve been from an asteroid ‚Äì as it is only on
        the coldest nights ‚Äì and almost comically dominated by the
        setting, gluttonously luminescent moon. Theodore had then
        grabbed a screwdriver from the workbench and bent down to remove
        the license plate ‚Äì which had said <emphasis>BLOOD</emphasis> in
        big black bold block letters ‚Äì and its containing frame. By the
        time he had settled into the frigid red leather of the exposed,
        roofless driver‚Äôs seat, Lenny Lather was full-to-bursting with
        adrenaline and laughing out huge streams of breathy steam. From
        behind him in the cabin, Pith had been
        <emphasis>guffawing</emphasis> plumes, too, as he‚Äôd briefly
        ignited his cocaine-sprinkled mustache instead of the
        bratwurst-sized cigar between his teeth. The smell of burning
        human hair had accented his explanation of the old car‚Äôs
        transmission and its direct path from source-to-nose for Pith
        had required a brief, unplanned intermission as it induced
        without warning his violent heaving ‚Äì still

        uncontrollable, cloudy fits lasting long after Lather had
        swerved the great length of the car from the gravel to his

        After the entirety of Northern European history had been
        decimated and subsequently forgotten, the Duesenberg named
        <emphasis>BLOOD</emphasis> had turned its orange, googley-eyed
        stare and narrow whitewalled hooves up the reflective,
        freshly-painted access of the new 24-hour grocery in the
        no-man‚Äôs-land between the cookie-cutter stares of the
        neatly-rowed Easterly neighborhood and the droning respiration
        of Interstate 43, two miles distant. It was 2:12 in the morning
        and most of the greasy-haired night stocking shift had been
        halfway through their third smoke break, circled around a
        store-used picnic table 50 yards from the far sliding airlock
        doors. The first to spot <emphasis>BLOOD</emphasis> had been the
        second shortest of the lot, whose weary scrutiny along the
        truest radian to the West from under his sweaty beanie in her
        entrance she had crossed, and the depth of her red as he first
        spied it had caused him vertigo ‚Äì as if he would fall in ‚Äì and
        cast upon the shorter-than-average length of his being an
        all-consuming existential doubt. The tallest and loudest of them
        had faced squarest the white faux-brick wall of the box building
        and was at that moment engaged upon a spirited rant about where
        and where‚Äônt and when a vapist ought to buy his Suck juice
        between long, gasping Sucks from his super-shiny Suck box. Of
        course, the arrival of a customer even at such a late hour did
        not warrant notice at a huge, broadly-servicing operation like
        theirs, but as <emphasis>BLOOD</emphasis> had crept through all
        four reflective yellow-checkered pedestrian crossings, closing
        without a flinch, and the details of her occupying caricatures
        had become more and more numerous, she had stolen the attention
        of the huddle, one-by-one, and elicited from each the rarest
        under-breath profanity of true, unmolested wonder.

        And the Sucking tallest, having realized he‚Äôd lost his audience,
        had been the last to turn and follow their eyes
        <emphasis>BLOOD</emphasis>‚Äôs way as she had halted coolly in
        front of the purely white glowing concrete leading into the
        closest customer entrance, and had ‚Äì without the gradual
        exposure over the length of her approach that his peers had been
        afforded ‚Äì dropped his Suck box and exclaimed at the sudden,

        the onset of their frostbite‚Äôs early stages even further stoked
        their already-uncontrollable boyish giggling. Theodore Pith had
        paused briefly to affix his monocle as firmly as possible in his
        eye socket and stuff down his spasmic
        <emphasis>guffaws</emphasis> with a few lip-smacking puffs of
        his then successfully-lit cigar before swinging his right door

        ‚ÄúStay here and wait at the ready, my good‚Ä¶ my

        declared, clicking it lightly shut again and turning on his
        heels toward the pale light of the store, twirling his cane in
        dramatically shortened strides so as to reproduce the oversped
        effect of a silent motion picture, puff-puffing away. As the
        doors had sensed him and indiscriminately whirred aside, he had
        turned to the smokers ‚Äì most of whom had still been reeling,
        grabbing for their hair ‚Äì and bobbed the bulk of his big black
        bowler toward their communion with his gloved black fingers by
        the brim.
      </para>
      <para>
        ‚ÄúTally-<emphasis>ho</emphasis>, my boys!‚Äù he had shouted,
        sending Lenny Lather‚Äôs wide open face toward the floor of the
        idling car as he doubled over himself in the first spontaneously
        asphyxiating, tear-lobbing laughter he‚Äôd yet to experience in
        the 21st century. As Theodore had entered the masterpiece of the
        boxed store‚Äôs bleakness in his cane twirling, head swinging,
        cigar puffing shuffle, he had made sure to stay his instinct to
        <emphasis>sneak</emphasis> for a swift, full-chat
        <emphasis>dart</emphasis>, instead, and the on-duty
        leather-faced embodiment of tedium‚Äôs wrath beneath his lone lit
        lane light had looked up from his <emphasis>People</emphasis>
        Magazine just in time to see the heel of a deeply black oxford
        and the last shiny inches of flowing black coattails disappear
        behind the potato sack endcap of the far Aisle 1. He‚Äôd
        hesitated, chin against palm, holding his next glossed page
        perpendicularly erect between his tightened thumb and index
        finger for a long few seconds of fantastic stillness ‚Äì had
        hastily attempted a diagnostic of his present senses ‚Äì before a
        locomotive-like segmented tube of cigar smoke had risen from
        against the light tiles and unsoiled trimming to intersect his
        line-of-sight where it met the darkened deli, recessed in the
        far wall from his hunch, the motion startling him into his own
        throat-clearing, counter-rounding, key-jingling,
        <emphasis>excuse me</emphasis>-shouting march toward the lumpy
        potato sacks and the climbing dissipation of the most
        unbelievable violation. As he had jingled, he had reflected on
        the few occasions in which he‚Äôd ever smelled tobacco smoke in
        <emphasis>his</emphasis> store: all incidental, most very brief,
        and many followed by a lengthy, unreasonably self-deprecating
        apology. To just walk in his Temple of Domestic Fulfilment
        during this most Serene Time of Silent Service, spewing orange
        nicotine on his premium, Food &amp; Drug Administration-blessed
        body and blood offering to the middle class was surely in
        ignorance, but could have even been <emphasis>in
        spite</emphasis>. Regardless, the transgression was worthy of
        the most merciless wrath, and he had been selected as its
        willing, capable vessel. In just the fifteen seconds it‚Äôd taken
        him to jingle his way to Aisle 1, he‚Äôd thought himself and his
        leather into flash-broiling, fast-rising fury.

        Perhaps the least expected sight that could have possibly

        as he rounded the potato sack endcap and filled his
        <emphasis>excuse me</emphasis> lungs in preparation through his
        nose ‚Äì was the labored lifting of the 125-pound eldest child of

        ‚Äú‚Ä¶now, see here!‚Äù Pith had replied with great effort, in the
        midst of weighing in his mind the worth of the cane as a
        casualty, then of the monocle, too, which had fallen out while
        he was weighing, and of his own physical intelligence, and
        whether or not it was capable of retrieving the cane by its
        brass lion‚Äôs head handle via the top of a flicking foot without
        losing his balance. Keys &amp; Leather, meanwhile, had been
        tortured at great length witnessing ‚Äì in Theodore‚Äôs
        gravitational struggle ‚Äì the Cuban‚Äôs ashes knocked all over the
        precious round Immanuel; the artisan‚Äôs Beloved, Chosen son of
        cheese ‚Äì a nauseating sensation of loss overwhelming all hope of
        his store‚Äôs defense. The Terrible Theodore had at once noticed
        his hesitation <emphasis>and</emphasis> arrived upon a plan to
        leave no prop behind. He had leaned forward with the girth of
        the wheel and closed the remaining few feet between them,
        advancing with the huge mass of Nazarethian dairy to bear it all
        down upon the unsuspecting Leather, who in his grief for the
        prized wheel was far too slow to deflect its incoming mass.

      <para>
        ‚ÄúNow, see here, chum!‚Äù Pith had forced from the furthest
        possible extremis of his best mob mouth as he transferred his
        burden all at once to its most concerned party, who collapsed
        against the multilayered tables that made up the fresh cookie
        display, with the weight of the wheel on his belly. As the
        stunned Leather struggled to separate himself without further
        soiling the only item in his store that sold for double a
        month‚Äôs paycheck, Theodore had replaced his monocle and returned
        for his cane in a single stride, which he‚Äôd then used after a
        return step to the pile of chocolate chip, almond nut, and
        fuming night manager to rap loose with the snout of the terrible
        brass cat Leather‚Äôs white knuckle-tight grip on the wheel with a
        lampoonish <emphasis>haha!</emphasis> before rolling the freed
        cheese toward the door in a villainous cackle.

        efforts, though, were interrupted after a time by the abrupt
        mute of Pith‚Äôs cackling in the second swooshing of the front
        sliding doors ‚Äì he had missed his last chance of pursuit. It had
        all been in vain ‚Äì he‚Äôd failed to guard the crown jewel of the
        whole suburb. As he had given up the chase and the cheese and
        slumped once more against the ruined pile, the ridiculousness of
        the crime against him nearly cracked a smile, but soon was
        deterred by the very real thought of explaining what had
        happened to his General Manager when she arrived in just five
        hours. After a moment, there, covered in cookies, dust, ashes,
        and shame, he had quietly begun to sob.

        After he had regained control of his diaphragm, Lenny Lather had
        been amused, outside, by the varying velocities in which the
        smokers of the night shift gave in to their curiosities about
        the presence of the seven-figure collectible and its purpose in
        waiting at its now healthier idle in front of their grocery
        store in the loneliest time of a Tuesday morning. The first and
        the bravest had been the one who first spotted their intrusion ‚Äì
        the shortest ‚Äì if only because he had remained entirely
        convinced for the duration that <emphasis>BLOOD</emphasis> and
        its two, period-dressed occupants were nothing but an apparition
        of his dead Grandfather and Great Uncle like others he‚Äôd thought
        he‚Äôd seen before, and ‚Äì though he‚Äôd been terrified by the
        clarity of this realest visit yet, he‚Äôd been irritated more than
        anything, and wanted to know ‚Äúwhy the hell can‚Äôt you just leave
        me <emphasis>alone</emphasis>?!‚Äù The others behind him had been
        staggered in the proximity to the waiting car they had achieved
        ‚Äì the lesser and most cowardly being the largest ‚Äì the Sucking
        evangelist ‚Äì who had been waiting for the great automobile to
        leave so he could forge the exchange of his broken Suck box for
        a new one from the back. In the delirium of his exhaustion and
        progressing frostbite, Lenny Lather had thought the image of the
        men where they were would make for an interesting, organic graph
        on the nature of courage ‚Äì their positions simply representing
        their unaltered datapoints, and had been considering how best to
        deal with or respond to the nearer, deluded one, who had by then
        come close enough to the elegant, professionally polished
        front-right fender to reach out and touch it with his unwashed
        hands, and appeared to be taking the matter under serious
        consideration. He‚Äôd been seconds away from finally deciding
        between his idiotic ideas for a joke response when by far the
        largest wheel of cheese he‚Äôd ever seen had come rolling out of
        the opening doors onto the concrete, followed closely behind by
        Theodore Pith who‚Äôd still had three-quarters or more of his
        cigar left to smoke and apparently switched to cheap mob clich√©s
        in his brief absence.
      </para>
      <para>
        ‚ÄúHaste, Don Lenny!‚Äù he‚Äôd yelled, re-opening his closest cabin
        door to chuck his cane in first. He‚Äôd then straddled the great
        wheel to position it against the step before making a scene of
        grunting and huffing against its side with his full weight.
        Again, the bewildered smokers had fallen silent ‚Äì they did not
        recognize the ridiculous delicacy because it was special
        inventory and could only be handled by the Holy Artisan herself.
        Lather had started revving the huge old straight-8 to answer
        Pith‚Äôs urgency, who had found himself fresh out of phrases after
        the wheel had finally succumbed to its capture and rolled into
        the footwell.

        ‚ÄúMake haste, make haste, my boy!‚Äù he‚Äôd shouted, diving

        his icing chauffer had responded by revving the behemoth and
        briskly popping her clutch, which had lurched the pair into the
        last, getaway stage of their late grocery heist. As
        <emphasis>BLOOD</emphasis>‚Äôs razor-edged hood ornament had
        sliced through the night by the dumbstruck smokers, Theodore
        Pith was unable to think of anything to shout at them as he

        Though the Lake Geneva Police Department was shown the security
        footage of that first theft by management, the theatricality of
        their matching getup had inadvertently obscured their
        identities, and the organization‚Äôs extreme deficit of
        imagination had left them stumped by the lack of license plates
        on the car, despite the free and effortless ability of just
        about any casual enthusiast of early American luxury automobiles
        and/or lackadaisical disciple of the Concours religion to

        flagship incubation was freely available with no more effort
        than it took to simply stop by her display amid regular shopping
        trips. Twice in two weeks, they stole both of her replacements
        for the biggest child without any significant alternation of
        their method, which frustrated her and the management nearly to
        the point of crises, and quickly lost all potential for fun in a
        third attempt ‚Äì their kicks were in their absurdity, not their
        <emphasis>effectiveness</emphasis>, and neither of them cared
        much for the cheese.

      <title>Basecamp's HEY matters, and not just because it took on
      Apple's App Store policies.</title>
      <para>
        Something always worth celebrating: a considered, no-nonsense
        new effort to reimagine email. I've lived through many notable
        milestones in this regard:
        <link xlink:href="https://youtu.be/vN4U5FqrOdQ?t=2321">Apple
        Mail</link> on the original iPhone,
        <link xlink:href="https://time.com/43263/gmail-10th-anniversary/">Gmail</link>,

        and (yes, really,) the revitalization of
        <link xlink:href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/4/17819636/microsoft-resdesigned-outlook-windows-web">Microsoft's
        Outlook</link>. Exciting innovations have abounded throughout
        email's history, but it's highly debatable whether or not any of
        them have really changed the way we use it in a profound way,
        yet I am unfailingly intrigued whenever somebody new comes
        along, so when I saw
        <link xlink:href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/15/21286466/hey-email-basecamp-price-availability-platforms-launch">Casey
        Newton's story</link> on <emphasis>The Verge</emphasis>'s
        frontpage discussing Basecamp's
        <link xlink:href="https://hey.com/">HEY</link> before I got out
        of bed on the morning of June 15th, I was delighted to see an
        organization still had the courage to invest their confidence
        and resources into their Ideas About Email. Originally,
        <link xlink:href="http://web.archive.org/web/20200510220647/https://hey.com/">HEY's
        homepage</link> included a prompt: ‚ÄúTo get on the list, email
        iwant@hey.com and tell us how you feel about email. Could be a
        love story, or a hate story. Could be long, could be short. It‚Äôs
        your story, so it‚Äôs up to you.‚Äù Though I knew it'd likely never
        be read, I decided to write them a letter about my personal
        history with email, which turned into an entertaining enough
        anecdote to publish here.
      </para>
      <para>
        The real reason HEY continued to be so widely covered by tech
        media, though, was its challenge to Apple's App Store policies
        after one of its updates was
        <link xlink:href="https://www.protocol.com/hey-email-app-store-rejection">rejected
        by the marketplace</link> just a day after Casey's story was
        published. Much drama ensued ‚Äì I have done my best to aggregate
        links to all the news stories on the subject in
        <link xlink:href="https://www.reddit.com/r/extratown/comments/hbncn6/news_surrounding_hey_the_upcoming_email_service/">a
        thread</link> on the
        <link xlink:href="https://www.reddit.com/r/extratown"><emphasis>Extratone</emphasis>

        <link xlink:href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/16/21293419/hey-apple-rejection-ios-app-store-dhh-gangsters-antitrust">the
        public resistance by Basecamp's CTO David Heinemeier
        Hansson</link> was probably a PR move, which is fine, but all I
        wanted to contribute was a review of the actual function of HEY,
        itself. After reading posts by some of my favorite bloggers,
        however, I think it would be redundant. Kev Quirk argued
        ‚Äú<link xlink:href="https://kevq.uk/email-is-not-broken/">Email
        Is Not Broken</link>,‚Äù to which Mike Stone responded
        ‚Äú<link xlink:href="https://mikestone.me/email-is-broken">Email
        Is Broken</link>.‚Äù Additionally, <emphasis>Business
        Insider</emphasis>'s Lisa Eadicicco published an
        <link xlink:href="https://www.businessinsider.com/hey-email-app-review-basecamp-inbox-2020-7">in-depth
        review</link> at the beginning of the month.
      </para>
      <para>
        My singular commentary: I'm worried that subscription services
        that exclusively accept large yearly sums like HEY inevitably
        become the ‚Äúcountry club for the most self-important emailers in
        business‚Äù which Casey spoke of. I guess we'll see.

        I am 26 years old, so I suppose I'm of the first generation
        that's never experienced life <emphasis>without</emphasis>
        email. I grew up on a farm in rural central Missouri and my dad
        was very much an early adopter. (You'd be surprised how
        e-enabled farmers were becoming in the early 2000s.) I cannot
        remember life before the humongous satellite dish was anchored
        in our front yard. Long before I had any reason to be online (or
        really understood what that meant,) he began and ended every day
        sitting at in front of a CRT on a corner desk, clacking away on
        a cigarette smoke-yellowed plastic keyboard for hours. I did not
        understand why, then, but in retrospect I realize that he was
        corresponding with a huge network of neighbors, politicians,
        family, and college friends via email lists/chains and that he
        depended on it both professionally and personally in a big way.
        As a single man living at least an hour's drive from a city of
        any size, I suppose my dad was predisposed to have a rich online
        life long before his suburban peers, which normalized it
        precociously for me.

        The summer before my first grade year, my elementary school
        became the first in the district to have a computer lab (also
        the first air-conditioned room in the building,) so my high
        school graduating class was literally the very first to have had
        any digital curriculum ‚Äì and an email address(!) ‚Äì for the
        entirety of our public school experience. Because of this, I
        think most of us were trained to think of email as a tool for
        school work ‚Äì it was eluded to by our computer teachers that our
        school email addresses were being monitored to make sure they
        remained so (obviously, they weren't.) As we grew into 6th-7th
        grade, however, we all seemed to end up with personal email
        addresses. I consider myself lucky to have experienced a very
        brief window ‚Äì before instant messaging/early social networks
        became mainstream and SMS became even remotely pleasant to use ‚Äì
        when my middle school friends and I corresponded exclusively by
        email when we weren't on the phone.

        It still sounds a bit silly to say, but I've spent the past few
        years coming to believe more and more strongly that my
        first-generation iPhone changed my life forever in a profound
        way ‚Äì <emphasis>especially</emphasis> my relationship with
        email. After watching
        <link xlink:href="https://www.howtogeek.com/674796/how-to-archive-or-delete-a-facebook-group/">Steve
        Job's introduction at MacWorld 2007</link> live, I promised to
        skip a year of Christmas gifts if my mom would agreed to buy me
        one, and she did. Obviously, it was like nothing else I'd ever
        experienced, and it completely changed how I responded to and
        thought about technology. Before smartphones, there was no
        checking email outside of time in the computer lab, which was
        intended to be quite strictly-regulated. I had a real advantage
        when I started bringing my iPhone to school ‚Äì absolutely no one
        knew what it was (a bizarre thought in contrast,) including
        teachers. Suddenly able to browse and read my inbox in class, at
        lunch, and on the bus, my use and consideration of email was
        propelled far ahead of my peers'.

        When I started an online magazine in 2016, I don't think I
        could've conceived of the extent to which running a modern media
        company ‚Äì even one targeted toward tech-savvy, early-adopting
        youth ‚Äì still involves email. I assumed that my audience rarely
        <emphasis>actually read</emphasis> from their inboxes and relied
        almost exclusively on social networks for content discovery, so
        I originally forwent any implementation of a newsletter. As I
        grew more and more interested in and engaged with the media
        beat, I was exposed to the email renaissance of the past 2-3
        years thanks to services like Revue and Substack, saw that it
        was good, and decided to give it a try for myself. I launched
        our semi-regular newsletter in April, 2017 on the subjects of
        ‚Äú<emphasis role="strong">Division</emphasis>,
        <emphasis role="strong">Art</emphasis>, and
        <emphasis role="strong">Media</emphasis>‚Äù and published a little
        over 30 issues over the course of 18 months. To be honest, I'm
        not sure I've ever had so much fun writing.
      </para>
      <para>
        Very shortly after it began, I observed our general engagement
        quadruple, and ‚Äì quite selfishly ‚Äì found the process of
        aggregation to be soothing and very mentally restorative. It
        exposed some pretty horrendous media consumption habits of mine,
        but it also offered a painless solution to them. As soon as
        everything I read became a potential item in the newsletter, I
        wasn't just reading for myself anymore (or at least, that's the
        mentality it gave me,) so I could no longer afford to dismiss
        particular subjects as easily or to skim so recklessly. I
        nurtured a much less chaotic media diet and found myself
        absorbing <emphasis>a lot</emphasis> more of what I wanted to
        without wasting so much time burning through links. I ended up
        feeling more focused in other, unrelated areas of my life, too.
        Obviously, I love email for that, and I miss writing that darn
        newsletter so much that I continuously look for excuses to do
        something similar.
      </para>
      <para>
        My former Tech Editor loved email perhaps as much, but she's
        definitely the only person I've ever met who finds the medium as
        <emphasis>entertaining</emphasis> as I do. (If you're
        <emphasis>really</emphasis> committed, I just made a
        <link xlink:href="https://twitter.com/i/events/1272514574420500481?s=13">Twitter
        Moment</link> full of all the best stuff I've ever posted about
        email ‚Äì mostly jokes like
        ‚Äú<link xlink:href="https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/921352650788130822">patron
        saint of email marketing</link>,‚Äù but there are one or two
        profound posts in there, too.) We realized one day that ‚Äì aside
        from The Webbys ‚Äì there are very few notable awards celebrating
        excellence in the email medium, so we decided our magazine would
        host the 2017 First Annual Email Awards. Unfortunately, I don't
        think anyone else had any idea what the heck we were trying to
        do, so we never received enough submissions. However, I noticed
        a great opening paragraph in the original announcement post
        which I thought made a worthy conclusion:

          journey of Greyhound. She is a Fletcher-class destroyer and is
          named after Rear Admiral Isaac C. Kidd, the first US flag
          officer to die during the Second World War.

        As much as you're going to loathe it, I must include this
        commentary on <emphasis>Greyhound</emphasis>'s historical
        accuracy if only because ‚Äì as a undoubtedly mainstream film ‚Äì
        its been so widely and competently reviewed, already, by real
        film writers. I am almost positive U-boats would rarely ‚Äì if
        ever ‚Äì waste their precious few viable torpedo shots firing
        ultra-close-range at the agile, super-speedy destroyers and
        destroyer escorts that protected supply convoys, and I am
        <emphasis>sure</emphasis> that none ever bothered with
        <emphasis>audibly addressing enemy ships</emphasis> over the
        radio in English. I understand that dramatizing historic events

        The contrast with the rest of the script's imposingly thorough
        and relentlessly-paced naval action dialogue is far too abrupt

        I was with naval history, I'm still too oblivious to the details

        The result is an emotionally effective film constrained by a

      <para>
        My friend Sierra has used SoundCloud almost exclusively for her
        music discovery, consumption, and recommendations, but has
        remained resolute in her unwillingness to financially invest in
        the service. As such, her listening is regularly interrupted by
        ads and limited to bitrates
        <link xlink:href="https://www.magneticmag.com/2018/01/soundcloud-lowers-sound-quality-uploads-half/">as
        low as 64kbps</link>. Since I was last employed, I have
        maintained a vow to her that I would pay for a subscription to
        SoundCloud Go+ ‚Äì the premium <emphasis>listener</emphasis> tier
        of the service ‚Äì with my own money, once I was once again in
        place at a steady job. This move would remove all advertising
        from her listening and
        <link xlink:href="https://help.soundcloud.com/hc/en-us/articles/360010227514-High-Quality-Streaming">up
        its bitrate to 256kbps</link>, among

        Two nights ago, we were refueling her car in preparation for
        another one of our recreational drives into rural Missouri when
        I made the decision on a whim to simply signup for a trial of
        Go+ on <link xlink:href="https://soundcloud.com/chordoslut">my
        own account</link> using Apple Pay, mostly because I knew we‚Äôd
        be going out of effective cell network range and one of Go+‚Äôs
        most emphasized features is its ability to download music
        locally. (Since my Apple Music subscription expired earlier this
        year, I only have
        <link xlink:href="https://bigkrit.com/music/king-remembered-in-time/">a
        single album</link> actually downloaded on my phone.)

        *** The above is what I wrote several weeks ago, just as I was
        beginning my trial period. Now, having experienced a significant
        amount of time as a SoundCloud Go user, I am a bit sad that my
        trial is over. To be honest, I fully intended to become a paying
        subscriber, but my PayPal account was $0.70 short of the $12.99
        monthly fee when the first billing cycle came, two weeks ago.
        This is not a conclusion I expected to come to, as SoundCloud‚Äôs
        fundamental arrangement could not possibly differ any more from
        the music streaming service I long claimed as my ideal own:
        Apple Music.

      <para>
        One major worry I would imagine potential subscribers may have
        when approaching SoundCloud as a replacement for their single
        music subscription service would revolve around the extent of
        SoundCloud‚Äôs establishment music industry library. There‚Äôs no
        way your Dad‚Äôs Sunday barbecue playlist is going to be on
        <emphasis>SoundCloud</emphasis>, right? Strangely enough, I was
        unable to find a single track that <emphasis>was not</emphasis>
        in the library. From my own favorite
        <link xlink:href="https://soundcloud.com/keithjarrettofficial">Keith
        Jarrett‚Äôs archives</link> to
        <link xlink:href="https://soundcloud.com/dixiechicks/sets/gaslighter-2">the
        new Dixie Chicks album</link>, every bit of big time record
        label-distributed music I could conceieve of could be found
        aside the Go+ badge (though notably, neither of these showed
        significant playcounts.) As far as the app experience goes, I
        <emphasis>swear</emphasis> it got smoother as soon as I signed
        up for Go+. This is probably bullshit, but regardless, with the
        seemingly ever-widening disparity in the experiences of free vs.
        premium users, SoundCloud appears to be moving actively away
        from the former.

        Some more technical bits: SoundCloud is now castable on

        steps which I do not recall. The crucial one, though, was my
        decision to use the System File Checker tool
        <literal>(sfc /scannow)</literal> with the added instruction to
        <emphasis>fix</emphasis> whatever errors it found.[^2] This
        drove my dearest little laptop into a cycle of self-diagnoses
        which results in an option screen including ‚ÄúReset PC.‚Äù After
        trying virtually every other option, I decided to try resetting,
        only to be met with connectivity error messages after pursuing
        the ‚ÄúInstall via Network‚Äù option, leaving the use of a bootable
        Windows 10 recovery USB as my only choice, in theory.

      <para>
        Another problem now arose: my mother's MacBook Pro is the only
        other machine I have any sort of access to at the moment, and
        MacOS no longer supports the creation of such a bootable USB for
        Windows via the Boot Camp Utility any longer. Nevertheless, I
        tried to make one by downloading the correct OS ISO and mounting
        it via UNetbootin, which didn't work. I then called
        <link xlink:href="https://www.colcomputers.com/">Columbia
        Computer Center</link>, who very generously agreed to make one
        for me and only charge me for the drive itself ($10!)

        Unfortunately, that one hasn't worked either, so I'm afraid I'm

      <title>I bought a desktop tower for the first time since 2010 and
      spent an embarrassingly long time struggling with Bluetooth

      <para>
        As with my
        <link xlink:href="https://bilge.world/hp-spectre-x360-review">entire
        history</link> of computer purchases, my acquisition of an
        <link xlink:href="https://support.hp.com/us-en/document/c06443577">HP
        ENVY Desktop tower</link>, today, was last-minute, ill-informed,
        and certainly irrational. You ‚ÄúPC master race‚Äù folk: please
        spare me the <emphasis>dude, you could've just built your own pc
        so much cheaper</emphasis> shit.[^1] Yes, I realize the sensible
        course of action would've begun with a two hour trip West to the
        closest Microcenter, where I'm sure the staff would've made PC
        shopping an absolute blast and I would've come away with a more
        powerful, much cheaper machine. However, after I managed to
        <link xlink:href="https://www.davidblue.wtf/finally-broke-windows/">break
        Windows</link> on my only machine this weekend (and subsequently
        failed to reset it,) I was getting especially behind on

        complete any of it on my iPhone.

      <para>
        It's been exactly 10 years since I last bought a desktop tower ‚Äì
        since I first set hands on the Dell XPS Studio desktop with
        which I would create the majority of my intellectual property ‚Äì
        and I was immediately surprised by how much smaller (6.12 x
        11.93 x 13.28 inches) and lighter (13.12 lbs.) this tower was
        than my expectations. The display, too, is remarkably light and
        thin. Rationally, I should not have been surprised by this, but
        I'm not going to punish myself for continuing to find any sort
        of magic in technology.

        In the box were a Bluetooth keyboard ‚Äì specifically, an HP model
        <link xlink:href="https://fccid.io/EMJKHSA-P003K">4251a-khsap003k</link>
        ‚Äì and mouse set, the latter of which I will hopefully never have
        to use, thanks to my
        <link xlink:href="https://youtu.be/oIAY1-aW8Es">Logitech
        G203</link> ‚Äì and was perplexed by the process of how to pair
        the former with the tower while it was in setup mode for far too
        long. I was just about to give up entirely when I revisited the
        packaging and noticed what I'd previously assumed was an
        anti-theft device, but was actually the fucking dongle for the
        pair. I continue to despise Bluetooth peripherals, obviously,
        but the multimedia function keys of the product led to some
        important realizations: I now had reason to use Windows Desktop
        Switching <emphasis>and</emphasis> have a calculator application
        again! However, I have yet to figure out how to alter the
        Function key's behavior (I'm not even sure it's possible:) in
        order to input <emphasis role="strong">Alt+F4</emphasis>, I have
        to input <emphasis role="strong">Fn+Alt+F4</emphasis>, which is
        far too clunky to depend on. The issue did lead to a revelation
        which I may or may not integrate permanently: I mapped
        <emphasis role="strong">Alt+F4</emphasis> to the
        previously-unused button on the very top of the G203. So far,
        it's been pretty nifty.

        That said, a component of my intention to create an intentional,
        static, upright-sitting desktop workspace included an allotment
        for a quality mechanical keyboard ‚Äì my justification was that
        any professional in a particular craft makes a point to have the
        best possible tools for the job, so a high-quality keyboard has
        actually been <emphasis>very</emphasis> long overdue, in my
        case. So, I sought out

        After a brief jaunt, I concluded that no reasonable person would
        be able to make heads or tails of the forum or
        <link xlink:href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/wiki/index">its

        usually seek out the best possible quality offerings of those

        hours every day, the last bit of refinement pays off very
        quickly. Considering how much typing I've done in the past 5-10
        years, I find it a bit silly that I hadn't before thought to
        optimize the hardware I've used to do so. Now that I've put at

          It is my privilege and my curse to write about every new major
          iteration to Apple‚Äôs mobile operating system, though I skipped
          iOS 13 last year, which was largely dominated by Dark Mode,
          the iPad OS fork, and Memoji ‚Äì which I could care less about,
          honestly ‚Äì and didn‚Äôt warrant my investment in a Full Post, I
          felt. The Photos app improvements were very welcome, but I‚Äôd
          departed from iCloud as my primary storage service, so I
          didn‚Äôt have anything relevant to say. iOS 14 is also mostly
          irrelevant to my own personal use, but represents a more
          abstract shift in design philosophy that I thought was worth
          commenting on. For myself, everything about it adds anxiety,

        My technology writing over the years has largely centered around
        my awe and confusion regarding what I've perceived as a
        divergent path from the future I once imagined. My closest guess
        as to this divergence's origin is the announcement of iOS7, with
        Apple's

        Thanks to The Big Beer Virus, this was Apple's first
        pre-recorded WWDC presentation (though the word ‚Äúlive‚Äù continued
        to be used on several occasions,) which made it especially
        surreal. During the wait for the Keynote to ‚Äúgo live,‚Äù the
        stream was occupied by an
        <link xlink:href="https://twitter.com/GoncaloCdM/status/1275110234000969728">animated
        Earth</link> from orbit. As the clock rolled over the hour's
        top, AURORA's
        ‚Äú<link xlink:href="https://song.link/us/i/1457598185">Daydreamer</link>‚Äù
        faded in and we began to grow closer to this Earth, gradually
        revealing that it was covered with millions of floating memoji
        in various states behind their animated MacBooks. Like much of
        the event to follow, this scene became more and more
        anxiety-inducing as we grew closer to the mob (keep in mind that
        I've never really found memoji cute, unlike plenty of folks.)
        Eventually, we changed pitch dramatically and plunged through a
        hole in the clouds straight toward the incenter of the spaceship
        at Apple Park, through the door, down the staircase, and into a
        completely empty ‚Äì but fully lit ‚Äì Steve Jobs theatre, where Tim

        That's what I wrote about WWDC. iOS 14 officially released five
        days ago, now, and folks are already showcasing some crazy

        I would go into detail, but I'm honestly not all that curious
        about the process, which is unusual. I hope more than anything
        that I am not loosing my curiosity or playfulness regarding iOS
        which not so long ago propelled

        Basically, I'm not going to do the full bit, this year, but I'd

        take throughout the past few months of the developer beta.
        Notably, there is simply far less to iOS 14 that's relevant to
        my life, personally, than any other release I remember,
        <emphasis>but that's okay</emphasis>. It's just a wee bit more
        difficult to motivate myself to talk about it. If there's one

          For the iPhone, the overarching theme is that they're finally
          letting it get complicated. The home screen starts simple, but
          it can be complex if you want it to and Apple's also finally
          putting different elements on top of other elements so you can
          see Siri on top of your current screen instead of taking over
          the whole screen.

        <emphasis>slightly</emphasis> varied execution of a smartphone
        operating system in comparison. I should disclaim, though, that
        these weeks with early iOS widget implementation ‚Äì which
        represents quite a hefty chunk of this release's significance, I
        think we can all agree ‚Äì have led me to the conclusion that I

        basement apartment-dwelling era in Oregon when I first
        discovered WinWorldPC and got into running a bunch of DOS VMs,

        mentioning <emphasis>The George Thing</emphasis>, which surely
        indicates that it is the most significant mention of word
        processing software in popular culture for at least a decade:

      <blockquote>
        <para>
          The clip was posted to YouTube and from there embedded in
          innumerable tweets, Facebook feeds, and blogs. Some commenters
          immediately, if indulgently, branded Martin a Luddite, while
          others opined it was no wonder it was taking him so long to
          finish the whole story (or less charitably, no wonder that it
          all seemed so interminable). But what was it about these
          seemingly obscure details that people found so compelling?
          Part of it was no doubt the unexpected blend of novelty and
          nostalgia: Many fans would be old enough to remember WordStar
          for themselves, and the intricacy of its interface seems
          somehow in keeping with Martin‚Äôs quirky persona, part
          paternalistic grandfather and part <emphasis>Doctor
          Who</emphasis> character. WordStar thus becomes an accessory
          to his public image, like the black fisherman‚Äôs cap he is
          frequently photographed wearing. But it is also clearly much
          more than that. Martin‚Äôs passion for the program is
          unmistakable...

        discourse revolves around <emphasis>value</emphasis> as it is
        created within our personal online writing spaces. Two of the
        many infinitely-quotable essays within this space: Mike
        Caulfield‚Äôs

        ‚Äú<link xlink:href="http://snarkmarket.com/2010/4890">Stock and
        flow</link>‚Äù from <emphasis>Snarkmarket</emphasis>. The former
        references Vannevar Bush‚Äôs infamous

        finishing and its description of a ‚Äúmemex,‚Äù which many cite as a
        disturbingly-apt prediction of the World Wide Web. Caulfield,
        however, disagrees:

          So most people say this is the original vision of the web. And
          certainly it was the inspiration of those pioneers of
          hypertext. But in reality it doesn‚Äôt predict the web at all .
          Not at all. The web works very little like this. It‚Äôs weird,
          because in our minds the web still works like this, but it‚Äôs a
          fiction.
        </para>
      </blockquote>
      <para>
        Reading back from a lens including this commentary, I
        immediately understood. The <emphasis>memex</emphasis> concept
        is far more intimate than the web has become (or perhaps ever
        was ‚Äì I wouldn‚Äôt know.) ‚ÄúStock and flow‚Äù defines creative value
        in two disparate types of media:
      </para>
      <blockquote>
        <para>
          <emphasis role="strong">Flow</emphasis> is the feed. It‚Äôs the
          posts and the tweets. It‚Äôs the stream of daily and sub-daily
          updates that reminds people you exist.
        </para>
        <para>
          <emphasis role="strong">Stock</emphasis> is the durable stuff.
          It‚Äôs the content you produce that‚Äôs as interesting in two
          months (or two years) as it is today. It‚Äôs what people
          discover via search. It‚Äôs what spreads slowly but surely,
          building fans over time.
        </para>
      </blockquote>
      <para>
        To be honest, I personally cannot imagine undertaking the task
        of explaining this differentiation to
        <emphasis>anyone</emphasis> in my own life, but if the
        reactionary movement within The Web back to a focus on
        <emphasis>valuable</emphasis> content is, indeed, underway,
        perhaps such conversations are bound to shortly become more and
        more natural. For my part, I have attempted setting up an
        experimental site on Github Pages using Jekyll in the past few
        days with partial success: as soon as I tried to specify a
        custom theme, I apparently broke it, at which point I realized
        that I had homework to do. As much as I hate to admit it,

        stand, WordPress‚Äô permeability throughout The Web is an
        <emphasis>advantage</emphasis> for those who just want to
        publish something as simply as possible. My counterargument to
        both Kev and myself:

        is a wonderful compromise</emphasis> in terms of substance and
        <emphasis>image</emphasis> among one‚Äôs super e-enabled,
        Mullenweg-disgusted peers. It‚Äôs very much pure Markdown, but
        it‚Äôs far more accessible, cross-platform, than SSGs due to its
        shear simplicity.

        One component which Digital Gardening would seem to offer others
        that I have never particularly struggled with is the freedom to
        write whatever I feel like writing. If anything, I have
        struggled in the opposite sense, existing in a state
        <emphasis>completely unhindered</emphasis> by consideration of
        the value my work may or may not offer anyone else. Perhaps the
        most substantial addition I‚Äôm capable of making to the Digital

        would‚Äôve expected to be making, just a year ago. A dedicated

        improving enough to make it a viable space within which to pound

        A confession of vanity: I suspect the only reason I haven‚Äôt yet

        For those of us who've written about technology, generally, for

        <emphasis>The Social Network</emphasis> had an almost comical
        disregard for any potential function as a substantial critique

        <link xlink:href="https://www.businessinsider.com/mark-zuckerberg-mentions-the-social-network-during-testimony-2018-4">said
        in court</link>, essentially, that he didn't know what the movie
        was about. I'm not particularly sure, either. I suppose the

        critical of <emphasis>the times</emphasis>, but
        <emphasis>documentaries</emphasis> certainly should, in my

        <emphasis>not</emphasis> that Facebook or Google employees are

          gives it all the feeling of camp.

        Now, on to the <emphasis role="strong">notably
        missing</emphasis>: Perhaps most important to note before I go
        on is that the film was produced by ‚Äì and directly promotes on
        several occasions ‚Äì one particular organization, called the
        <link xlink:href="https://www.humanetech.com/"><emphasis>Center
        for Humane Technology</emphasis></link>, which notably has a
        .com rather than a .org domain... hm. Immediately after watching
        the film, I complied with its direction to its website, where I
        was specifically looking for ‚Äúsolutions‚Äù to the issues it
        presented. Aside from Wikipedia (sortof,) it neglected to
        mention the abundance of alternative organizations and projects
        who've been building against the adtech-funded web for ages ‚Äì
        some for decades. Unfortunately, neither the organization's
        website nor the film's webpage list any of these alternatives,
        whatsoever, which personally leads me to believe
        <emphasis role="strong">the whole thing is bullshit</emphasis>,
        for lack of a better term.

        The film essentially argues for a single choice: using social

        <emphasis role="strong">you have a choice of

        Now, I've always considered the ability to change a computer's
        name an immense privilege. My first ‚Äúreal‚Äù computer's name was
        Clementine, then there was Bertha, two Sophies (probably my
        favorite traditionally female name, so I excuse myself,) Silas,
        Linus, Uel, Jehoshaphat, Temba, Knot, and now Hildur. My iPhone
        8 Plus' name is Gravel. However, I realize that most users could
        care less, and I think that's completely rational. Technically,
        suggesting you change your phone's common name to that of ‚Äúyour
        favorite television character‚Äù
        (<link xlink:href="https://fortitude.fandom.com/wiki/Hildur_Odegard">Hildur
        Odegard</link> is my favorite character in

        <emphasis>not</emphasis> bad advice, even within its own
        privacy-centered argument, it's just that it's
        <emphasis>ridiculously</emphasis> low priority (or should be)
        compared with doing just about anything else along this vein. A
        conundrum is presented: I cannot imagine these people sitting
        down and seriously jotting down ‚Äúchange device name‚Äù as step 1
        in their strategy, but I also cannot fathom an incentive for
        them to expend such effort facetiously or maliciously. Again,
        incompetence/ignorance is the only remaining explanation.

        browser extensions. However, the ‚Äúdetox‚Äù seems to have been lost
        at some point along the way. No amount of privacy (yes, I do
        think it's hilarious that I can freely refer to ‚Äúprivacy‚Äù as a
        commodity with a positive quantity) can detoxify one' social
        media addiction. The savvy reader notes the ‚ÄúSupported by

        I suspect this is another case of <emphasis>don't go to those

        <emphasis>More privacy</emphasis> is a more tangible vector upon
        which to ‚Äúinnovate‚Äù than simply <emphasis>putting down the
        fucking phone</emphasis>, but the interviewees in the film at
        least touched upon a very important insight in that regard:
        <emphasis role="strong">turn off all your
        notifications</emphasis>. I genuinely believe turning off
        <emphasis>all</emphasis> notifications is a good way to proceed,
        especially if this film (or anything else, for that matter) has
        made you feel uncomfortable about your relationship with your
        phone. I realized that I'd somehow allowed YouTube to clutter my
        notifications unconsciously for <emphasis>years</emphasis>,
        which is disturbing. In general, the apps who's notifications
        I'd probably value the most (Bandcamp!) are the ones who use the
        feature the least/the most subtly.

        Leaving your phone in a different room while you sleep is a good

        (Displaced from your bed or stone dead, your chances of making
        use of your handset in an emergency are about the same, I'd
        wager.) I suspect it's long overdue for a reboot, anyway. As far
        as ‚Äú<emphasis role="strong">Email Addiction</emphasis>‚Äù goes, I
        suggest you first take an afternoon to go through your inbox and
        make use of GDPR's greatest gift: the single-click opt-out, most
        often found in very small text in a given email's footer. If
        you're <emphasis>really</emphasis> serious, unsubscribe from
        even the newsletters you <emphasis>do</emphasis> read and make
        yourself resubscribe to them. Make use of your preferred email
        platform's archives feature ‚Äì or don't ‚Äì but clear everything
        from your inbox itself. Mark it all as read. Then, you'll be
        ready to seek out other <emphasis>Email Wellness</emphasis>

        If quitting social media cold turkey is not viable in your

        start. Yes, it's okay to announce on Facebook that you're taking
        a break from Facebook. There <emphasis>is</emphasis> a very good
        reason: accountability, to both yourself and your friends. If
        you are interested in the alternatives I mentioned before,

        My own advice on ‚Äúprivacy:‚Äù don't worry about installing browser
        extensions, or using a different browser for that matter. Aside
        from a password manager, there is no need to download or install
        any additional software to protect your information. All the
        ‚Äúprivacy tools‚Äù you need are already present on your device, and
        they mostly consist of geolocation settings. If you're an iOS
        user, you've already been confronted with them in the past few
        months. If you are still genuinely bothered by automated data
        collection unseen by human eyes, your only next step ‚Äì if we're
        really honest with ourselves ‚Äì is figuring out how you're going
        to go without the internet. Untracked browsing is no longer a
        realistic option.

        ‚ÄúWhile streaming media is pitched to us as tailored to our

        to note, ‚Äúthe business of it is in fact closer to

      </para>
      <para>
        The company has faced criticism in other areas, most recently by
        <emphasis>The New Yorker</emphasis>‚Äôs Alex Ross in a widely-read
        review of
        ‚Äú<link xlink:href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/decomposed">Decomposed:
        The Political Ecology of Music</link>,‚Äù a new book by University
        of Oslo professor Kyle Devine, entitled
        ‚Äú<link xlink:href="https://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/the-hidden-costs-of-streaming-music">The
        Hidden Costs of Streaming Music</link>.‚Äù Ross first cites a
        statement by Spotify CEO Daniel Elk, ‚ÄúThe artists today that are
        making it realize that it‚Äôs about creating a continuous
        engagement with their fans,‚Äù arguing the true meaning of his
        words to be ‚Äúto make a living as a musician, you need to claw
        desperately for attention at every waking hour.‚Äù His most
        original (as in, yet to be considered in the mainstream
        discourse) argument, though, involves the service‚Äôs
        environmental impact. He cites Devine‚Äôs depiction of a profound
        cultural delusion surrounding the consumption of music,
        suggesting that music is ‚Äúseen as a special pursuit that somehow
        transcends the conditions of its production.‚Äù
      </para>
      <blockquote>
        <para>
          In a chapter on the digital and streaming era, Devine drives
          home the point that there is no such thing as a nonmaterial
          way of listening to music: ‚ÄúThe so-called cloud is a
          definitely material and mainly hardwired network of
          fiber-optic cables, servers, routers, and the like.‚Äù This
          concealment of industrial reality, behind a phantasmagoria of
          virtuality, is a sleight of hand typical of Big Tech, with its
          genius for persuading consumers never to wonder how
          transactions have become so shimmeringly effortless.
        </para>
      </blockquote>
      <para>
        Also noteworthy are questions of Spotify‚Äôs viability as a
        business, which Ross includes by citing
        <link xlink:href="https://www.barrons.com/articles/spotifys-losses-widen-as-subscribers-keep-growing-51596034688">a

        versus analysts‚Äô expectations for a 41-cent loss.‚Äù Spearheading
        this year‚Äôs news conversation surrounding the company, though,
        were its widespread acquisitions in the Podcasting industry,

      <title>Responsible Curation</title>
      <para>
        For solutions to address Spotify‚Äôs overwhelming skew toward
        rewarding popular music with even more popularity, we can first
        look within its own history to just a few years earlier, when
        human curation was more equally matched in its fight against
        algorithmic curation. In 2015, the company claimed that
        ‚Äú<link xlink:href="https://pitchfork.com/features/article/9686-up-next-how-playlists-are-curating-the-future-of-music/">Half
        of Spotify users stream from other users‚Äô playlists at least
        monthly</link>.‚Äù <emphasis>Pitchfork</emphasis>‚Äôs Marc Hogan
        profiled a number of ‚Äúpower users‚Äù within the upper percentile
        in terms of followers and personal playlist popularity. Notably,
        all of his examples are male.
      </para>
      <para>
        Generally, human curation should hypothetically combat its
        algorithmic counterpart in terms of favoring already
        commercially successful content, if not its gender disparity.
        The industry‚Äôs other biggest player, Apple Music, has invested
        heavily and successfully in the former. (Disclosure: I have been
        an Apple Music subscriber since its launch.) <emphasis>Fast
        Company</emphasis> addressed this contrast in a 2018 long read
        entitled
        ‚Äú<link xlink:href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90205519/spotifys-playlist-for-global-domination">Spotify‚Äôs

      <blockquote>
        <para>
          Cook‚Äôs words embody Apple‚Äôs longstanding critique of Spotify,
          which is that its algorithms are eroding music‚Äôs spiritual
          role in our lives. Cook doesn‚Äôt mention Spotify by name but
          says, ‚ÄúWe worry about the humanity being drained out of music,
          about it becoming a bits-and-bytes kind of world instead of
          the art and craft.‚Äù
        </para>
      </blockquote>
      <para>
        Then again, the same article also quotes Tim Cook ‚Äì the CEO of
        the most valuable company in the history of the world ‚Äì as
        insisting ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not in it for the money.‚Äù In turn, Daniel Elk
        is quoted, saying ‚ÄúMusic is everything we do all day, all night,
        and that clarity is the difference between the average and the
        really, really good,‚Äù though what exactly he is quantifying as
        ‚Äúreally, really good‚Äù is not entirely clear. In context, the
        words of both leaders seem untrustworthy ‚Äì vague, at best.
      </para>
      <para>
        In tremendous and relevant contrast to the voices of these CEOs
        is that of Ethan Diamond, CEO and co-founder of Bandcamp, a
        music streaming service unlike any other. In
        <link xlink:href="https://mtflabs.net/podcast076/">an interview
        with Music Tech Fest director Andrew Dubber this May</link>,
        Diamond exemplifies an entirely different mentality in running a

      <para>
        In 2007, Diamond and former colleagues Shawn Grunberger, Joe
        Holt, and Neal Tucker set out to build the equivalent of

        musicians. As Holt bemoaned in
        <link xlink:href="http://htmltimes.com/band-camp.php">a 2008
        interview with <emphasis>The HTML Times</emphasis></link>,

        From its very origin, the team designed Bandcamp to make the

          names intact. We mutter the various incantations necessary to

          for your hits, they find your music long before they find
          bonkersforlyrics.com or iMyFace. We give your fans easy ways
          to share your music with their friends, and we give you

      <para>
        In the years since, Bandcamp has demonstrated time and time
        again the sincerity in its commitment to artists through
        programs like ‚ÄúBandcamp Fridays,‚Äù when the service waives its
        cut of artists‚Äô revenue (ten percent on physical releases,
        fifteen percent of digital.) In 2017, the company
        <link xlink:href="https://pitchfork.com/news/bandcamp-donating-proceeds-to-transgender-law-center-this-friday/">donated
        a Friday‚Äôs share of proceeds to the Transgender Law

        proposal to ban trans people from serving in the U.S. military.
        This year, throughout the Coronavirus pandemic, the company has
        repeatedly
        <link xlink:href="https://daily.bandcamp.com/features/bandcamp-covid-19-fundraiser">brought
        back the program</link> in recognition of its impact on
        independent artists, and the results have been profound. On
        March 20th, for a specific example, $4.3 million worth of
        purchases was distributed.
      </para>
      <para>
        Unlike Spotify, Bandcamp <emphasis>is</emphasis> a profitable
        company, and has been for nearly a decade. In Dubber‚Äôs
        interview, Diamond explains their financial origins:
      </para>
      <blockquote>
        <para>
          In 2007/2008 we took a little bit of VC funding and then

          maintain the vision that we‚Äôve had for the company for a long
          time.
        </para>
      </blockquote>
      <para>
        Also in contrast to Spotify, Bandcamp explicitly invests in less

          result of that is that you have weird subgenres and a lot of
          music, I think, that wouldn‚Äôt necessarily be covered anywhere
          else.

      </blockquote>
      <para>
        Bandcamp has long demonstrated an anthesis to the business
        models technology companies have been so criticized for
        upholding and has done so in relative obscurity from the media.
        In his interview, Dubber asks Diamond one of the primary
        questions prompting the creation of this essay: ‚Äúhow come
        Bandcamp doesn‚Äôt get mentioned in all these press articles about
        music services?‚Äù In answer, Diamond offers his own business
        decisions out of ‚Äú[his] personal preference:‚Äù
      </para>
      <blockquote>
        <para>
          I like the idea that Bandcamp hangs out in the background and

          Bandcamp, Bandcamp.‚Äù[^2]
        </para>
      </blockquote>
      <para>
        As a <emphasis>Tastemaking</emphasis> enterprise, Bandcamp has
        combined magazine-style editorial publishing with user-created
        content in the form of Collections ‚Äì which allow listeners to
        display music they‚Äôve purchased on a customizable web page ‚Äì and
        Artist Recommendations, which extend from a creator‚Äôs Collection
        to those who follow them. This system has demonstrably lead to
        community and cultural wellness by genre via responsible
        commentary and selection from curating creators with authority,
        while still profiting its parent company tremendously. Bandcamp
        has grown from four to seventy employees in its 13-year
        lifespan, <link xlink:href="https://bandcamp.com/about">while
        helping artists earn $634 million</link> as of December 2020. In
        the music industry, it is unquestionably an outlier. Diamond
        inadvertently explains Bandcamp‚Äôs success in response to a
        question from Dubber on the company‚Äôs comparatively slow pace in

        The solution to the ‚Äúdebacle‚Äù of streaming music, then, is not

        Somewhere along the research process for one of my school

        <link xlink:href="https://www.davidblue.wtf/git-peer-review/">revision
        tracking and peer review via Git</link>. Having dipped my toe
        back in academia, any such circumvention of its penchant for the

        <emphasis>Just wait until I show these goons how to use
        hyperlinks.</emphasis> Perhaps inevitably, I was launched into
        the Git-Gone Bender I'm still riding simply because I finally
        had ample reason to actually understand it. In just two months,
        I've created and forked a total of nearly 80 repositories on
        <link xlink:href="https://github.com/extratone">my new GitHub
        account</link>. Though I'd created one for each of my web
        properties ages ago, I had absolutely no idea how to actually
        make use of them, so they were all quickly abandoned. In the
        past two weeks or so, I think I've actually begun to get the
        hang of the system's core intricacies, best exemplified by
        <link xlink:href="https://github.com/extratone/bilge"><emphasis>The

        ‚Äú<link xlink:href="https://github.com/extratone/bilge/issues">Issues</link>‚Äù
        regarding the CMS and/or the Repository, itself, have also fit
        in these categories well, so far. Just today, I discovered that
        one can simply tag Issues by their number to describe
        <link xlink:href="https://github.com/extratone/bilge/commits/main">Commits</link>,
        which form an impressive revision-tracking changelog when

        Discussions were opened up to more users. At the moment, I
        cannot imagine a single application for forums in the context of
        my blog's repository, but
        <link xlink:href="https://github.com/extratone/bilge/discussions">I
        turned them on, anyway</link>. It's very possible that all of
        the documentation-generating functions of Git are entirely
        unnecessary in this case, but ‚Äì as I entrust GitHub with the
        eternal task of archiving such work ‚Äì it is my hope that it will
        help me add further structure to my process.

        Were it just I who came to you with only my voice on this cold
        night, proclaiming the imminent release of a whole numerical
        version of a third-party mobile Twitter client in 2021, you
        really would have no choice but to send for the laws, for you‚Äôd
        be left no consideration other than my comprehensive descent

        <link xlink:href="https://bilge.world/tweetbot-5-ios-review">825
        days ago</link>, I told you lots about the history surrounding
        the development of Tweetbot 5, which I confidently described as
        ‚Äúlikely the last com¬≠pet¬≠i¬≠tive third-par¬≠ty Twit¬≠ter app for
        iOS.‚Äù After spending the past few months diving deep into iOS in
        preparation to
        <link xlink:href="https://github.com/extratone/bilge/issues/45">review
        and reflect</link> upon Apple‚Äôs current flagship handset, my
        eyes have been opened to the exponentially-increasing pace of
        the whole environment‚Äôs metamorphosis during the course of my
        lapsed attention. In the name of progress, I‚Äôve done my best to
        make a point of looking back, too, yet something astonishingly
        personally relevant managed to slip past me until just last
        week: <emphasis role="strong">there is a sixth version of the
        Tweetbot app</emphasis>. At this moment,
        <link xlink:href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/tweetbot-6-for-twitter/id1527500834">it
        is listed on the App Store</link> as an ‚ÄúEarly Release‚Äù version,
        though its predecessor can still be downloaded by those who‚Äôve
        already purchased it in the past, like me. This is an unusual
        practice ‚Äì usually, pre-release versions of iOS apps can only be
        distributed through Apple‚Äôs developer beta testing
        infrastructure, though Testflight. Notably, Tweetbot developer
        company Tapbots was
        <link xlink:href="https://twitter.com/tapbot_paul/status/1354145779494100992?s=21">apparently
        required</link> to take down Tweetbot 5‚Äôs store listing 30 days
        before releasing Tweetbot 6.

        I can‚Äôt remember exactly why ‚Äì though I suspect I was just
        fucking around on my phone before bed, bleary-eyed ‚Äì but the
        implications of this next numeral passed me by the first time I
        saw and downloaded Tweetbot 6, two weeks ago. Perhaps it‚Äôs
        because the app didn‚Äôt appear to have any new features ‚Äì in
        fact, it‚Äôs technically got <emphasis>less</emphasis> than 5,
        though those that have been removed ‚Äì user-specified URL

        worked in a good while anyway. As my old fav, <emphasis>The

        coverage of 6</link>, blame for these omissions rests solely on
        Twitter, Inc., itself, who‚Äôs continued to hold its API
        development inordinately close-to-chest. I didn‚Äôt bother to find
        out about this, though, because my first assumptions upon poking
        around the new app ‚Äì especially after encountering its new
        subscription requirement in order to use any of its substantive
        features ‚Äì was that its developers had ceased any actual time
        investment into the app long ago, and that 6 was a new version
        in number and rudimentary visual updates, only, shoved out in
        hopes of peaking old, loyal users like myself enough to get us
        to download it, at least. In the disappointment I‚Äôd already
        expected, I closed and immediately deleted the app.

        I‚Äôve paused everything else to write you on this, though,

        amount of buzz coming from even the most mainstream of tech
        media in a simple search. (Yes, I am ashamed about it.) You‚Äôre
        still reading, but perhaps ‚Äì as I was, originally ‚Äì you are
        doing so from an appropriately-jaded, well-read perspective on
        software, generally, in 2021. Perhaps you‚Äôre looking at the

          Twitter is a vaguely terrible way to spend your time these
          days, but if you (like me) can‚Äôt tear yourself away from the
          social media service / entryway into hell, you‚Äôll want
          Tweetbot, which actually makes using Twitter far less painful.
          Tweetbot shows you the tweets of the people you follow, in the
          order that they tweeted them. There are no ads or promoted
          tweets, powerful mute filters to block out unwanted noise, and
          (thanks to Twitter‚Äôs unfriendly API changes) no notifications
          to constantly ping you to come back to the app.
        </para>
      </blockquote>
      <para>
        Here‚Äôs to Chaim for exposing me to a perspective I never would
        have otherwise considered: Tweetbot‚Äôs lack of push notifications
        as a <emphasis>positive</emphasis>. If you‚Äôre wondering, no,
        this new app does not ~yet~ include any additional notification
        integration, and it‚Äôs not clear whether or not it‚Äôs on Tapbots
        future roadmap for the app, or where. As for the reality of
        integrating Tweetbot 6 into your current Twitter use, I stand by
        my argument that deleting the native Twitter app isn‚Äôt really an
        option if you plan to ever view your notifications on your
        phone. The popular assumption (I assume) if you‚Äôre still reading
        is that you are a ‚Äúpoweruser,‚Äù meaning details about my own
        configuration are probably irrelevant. If by chance you‚Äôve just
        downloaded Tweetbot for the first time, you should take the time
        to disable notifications for Tweetbot entirely, but leave them
        on for the native Twitter app, even if you decide to banish it
        to your App Library. Before I began any work on this review, I
        made sure to swap in Tweetbot 6 where the native app had been in
        my dock for several years, now. I originally pushed the native
        app all the way to page 6, but immediately found this extreme.
        Instead, I put it in the bottom-right corner in my second
        screen, as you can see in the screenshot below (which also
        serves as proof, if you needed it.)

        I should also note how much my own engagement on Twitter has
        diminished in the past 3-5 years. Not to manifest tiny violins ‚Äì
        in turn, my engagement on (and investment in)
        <link xlink:href="http://bit.ly/dbmasto">Mastodon</link> has
        increased exponentially, and it‚Äôs of a <emphasis>much</emphasis>
        higher quality. I bring it up for context‚Äôs sake: I can afford
        to prioritize Tweetbot in my Twitter use because of how few
        daily notifications I get ‚Äì a number which is unusual for
        someone who uses Twitter as much as I do. Inevitably, my own use
        is once again going to factor heavily in this work, as is the
        significance of my relationship with Twitter, generally, in my
        life. If you didn‚Äôt already know, I‚Äôve met basically all of my
        friends since high school through Twitter. As of this moment, my
        private ‚ÄúFriends‚Äù Twitter List includes 149 accounts, and I‚Äôve
        spent more than 10 years, now, reading almost every single one
        of their Tweets. I have been as critical of the service as
        anyone, but ‚Äì whether or not either of us are willing to
        acknowledge it, wholly ‚Äì I believe the intimacy of this
        arrangement to exceed that of any in-person relationship
        <emphasis>I</emphasis> have ever had. Reading the random
        thoughts of these people seconds or minutes after they‚Äôve popped
        into their heads for all this time has been an experience unique
        to the format Twitter pioneered, if not to the service, itself.
        I have no choice but to acknowledge that I am
        <emphasis>deeply</emphasis> invested in not just Twitter, but
        Twitter‚Äôs less-than-visible Lists feature, emotionally and
        intellectually. When I hit my
        <link xlink:href="https://twitter.com/neoyokel/status/1281646353102147584">follow
        limit</link>, several years ago, Lists also became my single
        means of acquiring new connections on the network. If it were to
        be removed, I would lose this ability, entirely, as well as any
        reasonable means of communicating with any of my friends.

        <link xlink:href="https://bilge.world/twitter-lists">written</link>
        and
        <link xlink:href="https://twitter.com/i/events/996616971880882176">Tweeted</link>
        so extensively about Lists. You should also understand just how
        miraculous the possibility of Tweetbot‚Äôs new future now seems,
        personally, unless you‚Äôre new to all of these ideas and don‚Äôt
        feel like reading that big ol√© Tweetbot 5 review of mine (which
        is fine.) Before I go into the history of Tweetbot, let me first
        share the single most telling feature in Tweetbot of Tapbots‚Äô
        belief in using Lists and share some evidence of
        <emphasis>others‚Äô</emphasis> present day belief in Tweetbot.
        Shamefully, I‚Äôve spent several years ‚Äì tens, if not hundreds of
        thousands of hours ‚Äì using Lists in Tweetbot, oblivious to its
        upmost Lists integration:
        ‚Äú<link xlink:href="https://tapbots.com/support/tweetbot6/tips/list.php">Use
        Lists as Timeline</link>.‚Äù Had I actually bothered to look at
        the support docs at any point, I would have discovered this long
        ago, which would have almost certainly made my given year.
        <emphasis role="strong">If you use Tweetbot and Lists, for the
        love of Gourd, please take a look</emphasis>. Here‚Äôs what those
        docs currently say, in full:
      </para>
      <blockquote>
        <para>
          One long time Tweetbot feature is the ability to use any of
          your lists as your main timeline. To do this, all you have to
          do is hold down on the ‚ÄúTimeline‚Äù label in the navigation bar
          (in the timeline tab) and a menu populated with your lists
          will appear. Select one and that will become your current
          timeline. You can switch to another list or back to your main
          timeline any time by performing the same action.
        </para>
      </blockquote>
      <para>
        Even after reading this multiple times, it still was not obvious
        to me what it was talking about, and I was unable to find
        precisely <emphasis>zero</emphasis> visuals on The World Wide
        Web of this action taking place, so I recorded and uploaded
        <link xlink:href="https://youtu.be/IO-ZSD-vymc">the video

        The discourse surrounding Tapbots‚Äô recent announcement has
        already reached a higher decibel count than I would have ever
        expected, so it‚Äôs obvious there are plenty of
        <emphasis>users</emphasis> who still
        <link xlink:href="https://twitter.com/neoyokel/status/1064579914538602496">love

        stories that <emphasis>The Verge</emphasis> has also stood
        firmly by it as the preferred Twitter experience. It takes a wee
        bit of digging, though, to discover the subtle bets on both
        Tweetbots and Lists from no less than Apple, Inc., itself. In
        the official Apple Shortcuts Gallery, a curated list entitled
        ‚ÄúTwitter Better‚Äù includes

        As for App Store rankings, the fact that Tweetbot 5 was forcibly
        removed from public listings makes it impossible to meaningfully
        judge recent popularity of Tweetbot on iPhone/iPad. Its
        MacOS-based sibling, though (called Tweetbot 3,) was the
        <emphasis>second most popular</emphasis> paid app

        a short while to check up on MacOS Big Sur, when I downloaded
        the current version (3.5.2, if you wanted to know) of Tapbots‚Äô
        desktop Twitter client and
        <link xlink:href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=219&amp;v=vHDNdMux16g">messed

        I suspect most active Twitter users in 2021 would be even more

        today‚Äôs Twitter experience than I was, assuming most of them
        joined more recently than myself and those I regularly interact
        with. For the sake of this Post, I reached out to Tapbots with
        an interview request about ‚ÄúTweetbot‚Äôs roadmap, Apple‚Äôs
        requirement that [they] remove 5 from the App Store 30 days
        beforehand, and why [they‚Äôve] decided to take this (risky, imo)
        bet on making our lives better,‚Äù though I don‚Äôt expect a reply,
        which is fine. They <emphasis>did</emphasis> respond to my
        support request regarding hardware keyboard shortcut support
        very quickly, saying they‚Äôll look into it. (Without being
        verbose, I‚Äôll just tell you that if a near future update to the

        Before I dig into the controversy and hypotheticals surrounding
        what Tweetbot 6 might become, let‚Äôs take a moment to qualify it
        vs all of one‚Äôs options to interact with Twitter on iOS
        <emphasis>currently</emphasis> (as in, Feb 11, 2021 at 19:24.)
        It‚Äôs almost certainly premature to do so, but skeptical readers
        would note, I‚Äôm sure, that its
        <link xlink:href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/tweetbot-6-for-twitter/id1527500834">listing
        on the App Store</link> is ‚Äúearly release‚Äù in name only, that I
        have just spent money on this specific version, which should
        therefore render inert the normal exceptions a review would make
        for beta or pre-release software. If you‚Äôve somehow come across
        this Post before reading anything else about Tweetbot 6 and
        simply want to know <emphasis role="strong">what is
        new</emphasis> for this version compared with 5.5.3 (its
        predecessor‚Äôs most recent release,) the frank answer as it
        stands is <emphasis>not much</emphasis>. Perhaps I‚Äôm doing
        something wrong, here, but the
        <link xlink:href="https://github.com/extratone/bilge/blob/main/docs/tb6links.md">YouTube
        videos and tech media articles</link> I could find dealing with
        the subject of additions, specifically, were all either
        misleading, entirely wrong, or both.

        While 6 lists one more option (for a total of 9) under Themes in
        the Display section of the app‚Äôs Settings menu, none are
        substantive variations of the same themes you‚Äôre familiar with
        from 5. ‚ÄúFuture Light‚Äù is just a more turquoise variant of the
        ‚ÄúDefault‚Äù blue UI theme in 5. In fact, the singular change in
        the Display menu is the addition of ‚ÄúSan Francisco Rounded‚Äù
        under the Fonts selection. Below, you can see side-by-side
        screenshots of the Tweet Detail view in Tweetbot 5 vs. Tweetbot
        6, with the regular SFUI font on the left and rounded variant on

        To be honest, I can‚Äôt really tell the difference between the
        typefaces in this view, but have used the new app enough to know
        I prefer the latter. More topically exemplified in that image is
        Tweetbot 6‚Äôs new support for social cards, which the Tapbots
        boys have executed in a startlingly beautiful way that puts
        Twitter to shame and makes one feel like you‚Äôve taken them for
        granted these past few years. Also in that vein and more than
        worthy of the same accolades is Tweetbot 6‚Äôs support for Twitter
        polls. They‚Äôve never looked so good.

        Somewhat on-trend, the app also includes two new icons, but ‚Äì if
        we‚Äôre being 100% frank ‚Äì they‚Äôre a paltry, dated-looking
        afterthought and Tweetbot deserves (<emphasis>needs</emphasis>,
        even) better branding. If I were allowed a singular compulsion
        to impress upon its developers, I‚Äôd make them put out a public
        call for new art. I‚Äôm all but dying to see what the community
        would come up with.

        So, if you were wondering what the fuck Tapbots have been doing

        app (and why its long-respected developers are now asking you
        for a whole dollar a month,) though, requires a broader look.

        For as long as I can remember, both the MacOS and iOS versions

        Yes, you are, Tapbot‚Ä¶ From a returning user‚Äôs perspective, it‚Äôs
        hard to understand what in Gourd‚Äôs name they‚Äôve been doing. I
        listened and read through every Tapbots interview I could find ‚Äì
        all but one with Paul, who has through the years continued to
        come across as a sensitive, well-read, even
        <emphasis>wise</emphasis> professional developer with a healthy,
        professional outlook on the work of his little (relatively)
        weathered company and its place within the warp speed nightmare
        that is the mobile software industry. I suppose I was expecting
        to find an explanation for what I saw initially as a minimal
        regard for Tweetbot‚Äôs history, in contrast to 6‚Äôs announcement.
        I wouldn‚Äôt find it, though, because in truth, I was sure I
        already knew it: Twitter made it clear over a decade ago ‚Äì just
        after they‚Äôd purchased Tweetie and slapped their own name on it
        ‚Äì that they had no intention of competing in the client space,

          Essentially, it‚Äôs now easier than ever to run incredibly janky
          software on your iPhone or iPad, remaining well clear of a
          warranty violation, yet the apps that stick out most boldly in
          the mind (at least for myself) are unfailingly apart from any
          sort of experimentation. Bear, for instance ‚Äì the writing app
          I evangelize to every iOS user and have continued to describe
          as ‚Äúthe most beautiful piece of software I have ever seen‚Äù ‚Äì
          just allowed registered beta testers access to its in-progress
          ‚Äú<link xlink:href="https://blog.bear.app/2020/12/the-editor-2-0-alpha-test-for-ios-is-coming-soon/">Editor
          2.0</link>‚Äù on iOS, which Shiny Frog describes as still in its
          ‚Äúalpha‚Äù stage, yet even I have as yet been unable to trip it
          up whatsoever. This is the league Tweetbot pioneered, in many
          ways. For the record, both Tweetbot 6 and Tweetbot 5 have been
          <emphasis>demonstrably</emphasis> more reliable for me in the
          past few months than Twitter‚Äôs native app, which has been
          crashing <emphasis>multiple times per day</emphasis> on my
          devices for quite a while during regular use. I‚Äôm accustomed
          to crashes, so I can‚Äôt say with 100% confidence that Tweetbot
          has <emphasis>never</emphasis> crashed, but it certainly
          hasn‚Äôt since I first downloaded 6 and began this review,
          despite my deliberate attempts to probe its every possible
          function.
        </para>
        <para>
          Not only is Tweetbot 6 reliable as hell ‚Äì it‚Äôs also stupid
          frugal. Currently, its App Store installation weighs in at
          10.9 MB, while Twitter‚Äôs app is more than <emphasis>ten times
          heavier</emphasis>, at 116 MB. I realize Sizes On Disk are
          further from your mind than they‚Äôve ever been in this age of
          outright computing gluttony and you probably couldn‚Äôt care
          less about

          In fact, I find it particularly telling that Tapbots has
          continued to prioritize such efficiency in their development
          <emphasis>despite</emphasis> operating under less financial,
          technical, and social pressure than ever to do so.

        In the ~month since the Tweetbot 6 story first broke (a nice
        birthday present!,) no less than three newish Twitter features
        have made the news. Last week, it (apparently) committed to the
        worst possible user-side content monetization model concept out
        of the dozens that have dipped in and out of rumor for virtually
        the service‚Äôs entire history:

        are slated to shade our collective experience with putrid
        <emphasis>freemium</emphasis> concerns.

        sound in concept like a worthwhile and genuinely value-adding
        feature addition for actual Twitter users, but any substantial
        expectations of the company feel far too risky to invest in. All
        the while, Twitter Spaces ‚Äì the audio-only Clubhouse-ish
        mutilation of Periscope‚Äôs corpse ‚Äì has been silently bestowed
        upon a secret set of @s at an achingly slow pace. I don‚Äôt know

        It‚Äôs just occurred to me how much more anxious the movements of
        Twitter, Inc. and Jack Dorsey‚Äôs horrendous facial hair would be
        making me if I had not discovered an (ironically) more stable,
        wholesome platform to replace them, years ago. No, I will not
        discuss Mastodon beyond this remark, but readers invested enough
        to get to this point who <emphasis>haven‚Äôt</emphasis> heard of
        the federated, open source social network by that name would do
        well to consult

        This privilege of choice ‚Äì even if it‚Äôs completely delusional ‚Äì
        has combined with Tapbots‚Äô thoughtful brush up of their
        trustier-than-ever Tweetbot to ease my longtime
        Twitter-dependent ass to a nigh-miraculous degree.
        <emphasis>However</emphasis>, stepping back from it all, I
        realized Tweetbot‚Äôs new life bets even heavier on that single,
        defining feature which the company hardly mentions, and could
        <emphasis>conceivably</emphasis> restrict ‚Äì maliciously or not ‚Äì
        or remove entirely without real consequences to their business
        or public standing via tech media outcry. <emphasis>What if

      <para>
        Upon this realization, I shot out of bed very late in a recent
        evening and went straight to fucking Trello, of all places, to
        sift through Twitter‚Äôs public development roadmap for any
        official word on their fate. I really did panic for a beat upon
        first reading the words
        ‚Äú<link xlink:href="https://trello.com/c/DSYUbM5D">Replacement

        functionalit</link><link xlink:href="https://trello.com/c/DSYUbM5D">y</link>‚Äù
        before realizing the actual intention of the card‚Äôs expression
        in the context‚Äôs syntax, which is probably about as positive as
        it could possibly be: a public suggestion that Lists will
        continue to be supported through 2.0, at least. The card sits in
        the ‚ÄúNesting‚Äù column (which I assume to be the lowest priority
        group, chronologically,) right between identical cards for

          Writing about Tweetbot 6 has been an illuminating personal
          experience, if you haven‚Äôt yet caught on. The timing of its
          release has proved awfully convenient, just predating the
          aforementioned catastrophe of disjointed features that has
          descended harder than ever before on Twitter‚Äôs own app,
          leaving it an absolute mess. When I initiated the symbolic
          swap maneuver documented at the very beginning of this review,
          I assumed I was going to find Tweetbot awkward to use as my
          primary in the present day, but have found the opposite to be
          true. The social network Tweetbot draws from is barely
          recognizable as the same property it drew upon originally,
          when its Lists-loving configuration was simply one of a dozen
          different interpretations of how one should interact with
          Twitter (by far the sharpest, I think we‚Äôd agree.) Tweetbots,
          in contrast, is virtually identical in principle, though the
          unwavering bearing of its development has resulted in the true
          definition of <emphasis>refinement.</emphasis> The result is
          the most <emphasis>beautiful</emphasis> way to use Twitter in
          2021, no competition, and is also crucially the singular means
          of interacting with it on one‚Äôs ‚Äúown terms‚Äù ‚Äì as long as yours
          align with The Lists Method, that is ‚Äì in an environment that
          feels predictable and fundamentally <emphasis>at your
          control.</emphasis>
        </para>
        <para>
          As much as I have
          <link xlink:href="https://youtu.be/LdBFMibyh3Y">praised the
          Mastodon app
          Toot</link><link xlink:href="https://youtu.be/LdBFMibyh3Y">!</link>
          as the most innovative social app available ‚Äì and will
          continue to do so until I encounter something more original
          and ingenious ‚Äì it‚Äôs perhaps the singular remaining cleverly
          playful Tweetbots feature which first opened my perspective to
          appreciate little Easter egg-like tricks. Indeed ‚Äì even after
          all we‚Äôve been through together these past ten years ‚Äì you can
          still cycle through all of Tweetbot‚Äôs visual themes by
          <link xlink:href="https://imgur.com/gallery/A1zbhLq">two-finger

          in 6. Quick Account Switching is the other less-than-obvious
          swipe function of note, which I‚Äôll rely on an embed stolen
          from Tapbots themselves to demonstrate:

        <para>
          I don‚Äôt think it should ever feel natural to speak
          sentimentally about mobile apps, but Tweetbot is a worthy
          exception. If you glance over the respective comments sections
          of the articles and YouTube videos I‚Äôve hyperlinked, you‚Äôll
          pick up on this phenomena of legacy Twitter users chucking
          back some tragically nostalgic sentiments in response to the
          reminder surfaced by the Tweetbot 6 news of just how long
          we‚Äôve been doing this. From my perspective, the
          <emphasis>other</emphasis> majority sentiment found there
          catalyzes the bizarre chronobending at play even further. I
          can‚Äôt believe how many folks continue to be flabbergasted by
          the idea of <emphasis>paying for software</emphasis> in 2021,
          but I‚Äôve been literally begging Twitter to charge me a monthly
          fee in exchange for some greater curative capabilities for as
          long as I can remember. The whole of my gospel, again, is that
          Tweetbot 6 has personally made using Twitter a little bit
          better than bearable, so I have no other reasonable choice
          available: I‚Äôm paying the fuck up.

        As you may or may not be aware, I‚Äôve spent all of my 2021 so far
        diving real deep into iOS, considering all that has changed
        since ‚Äúan iPod, a phone, an internet communicator.‚Äù I‚Äôve tuned
        in to the output of explicitly Apple-adjacent publications both
        old (<emphasis>MacRumors</emphasis>, <emphasis>Apple
        Insider</emphasis>, <emphasis>9to5 Mac</emphasis>, etc,) and new
        (<emphasis>Apple Scoop</emphasis>,
        <emphasis>MacStories</emphasis>,) which have all metamorphosed
        in huge, mostly-redeemable ways just as their primary subject
        has. I have my own pubescent stories of Mac occultism, but I do
        not consider my relationship with the brand to be an essential
        part of my identity, as so many do and have. Apple, Inc‚Äôs story
        is spectacular and infinitely-relevant so long as they remain
        ‚Äúthe most valuable company in the history of the world,‚Äù as I so
        love to describe them. Like many of you, I‚Äôm sure, I am often
        compelled to bring up the humongous contrasts in the historical
        context of the company ‚Äì to scream infinitely many variations of
        the observation that Apple was basically the fucking
        <emphasis>indie</emphasis>, premium-tier consumer tech
        manufacturer owned by the Creative Class for the first half+ of
        their existence, and have somehow maintained that
        <emphasis>Think Different</emphasis>‚Ñ¢ brand narrative as they
        have definitively become the Big Blue of their time.
      </para>
      <para>
        From my perspective, the responsibility for the wellbeing of
        this utterly-delusional, occasionally very dangerous sentiment
        actually lies fairly squarely on those of us who consider
        ourselves <emphasis>better than all of that</emphasis> because
        of our Debian workflows and their ancient command line
        utilities. (For the record, this is also 100% delusional as
        things stand in 2021.) One thing I think we can all acknowledge,
        though, is that Apple‚Äôs image has been inextricably bound with
        <emphasis>musicmaking</emphasis>, throughout, far more than any
        other even remotely comparable tech company. Naturally, the
        business still loves to bring this up all the time in big,
        glossy gestures. The topical example of note would be the only
        worthwhile content I‚Äôve yet to encounter on Apple TV+:
        <link xlink:href="https://tv.apple.com/us/movie/billie-eilish-the-worlds-a-little-blurry/umc.cmc.5waz3hfo9r1133t8arap8b6nq"><emphasis>Billie
        Eilish: The World‚Äôs a Little Blurry</emphasis></link>, which
        documents the highlights of the young, beloved musician‚Äôs
        prodigious ascension. For what it‚Äôs worth, I appreciate some
        special insights I gained thanks to the film, which I do not
        actually consider at odds with the truth of its super
        on-brandness for Apple.
      </para>
      <para>
        An interesting take I found from 2017 from a new favorite voice
        on the <emphasis>business</emphasis> end of tech reporting:
        ‚Äú<link xlink:href="http://thein.fo/8dba9a5022e1d273">How Music
        Drowns Apple‚Äôs Innovation</link>‚Äù by <emphasis>The
        Information</emphasis>‚Äôs Jessica Lessin portrays Apple‚Äôs
        relationship with music distribution and the music industry as a
        sort of compulsive distraction from its ambitions in serving
        video content, namely. Lessin points out the everpresent
        reminders of this obsession:
      </para>
      <blockquote>
        <para>
          And so it is no wonder that Apple‚Äôs first forays into original
          video content fall under Apple Music. It‚Äôs worth noting that
          the first series the company announced‚Äî‚ÄúCarpool Karaoke‚Äù is
          literally about singing; ‚ÄúPlanet of the Apps‚Äù features rapper
          Will.i.am as a judge.
        </para>
      </blockquote>
      <para>
        I think I can speak for the majority of my audience when I
        suggest that the targets of Lessin‚Äôs cynicism would be more than
        welcome, if they were The Whole Truth. Indeed, the most valuable
        company in all of history retaining an ‚Äúemotional‚Äù attachment to

          accommodate and support the artists who make the music, not
          just the top-tier artists, but the kids in their bedrooms too,

        Assuming you‚Äôre already an Apple Music user, it‚Äôs very possible

          It's hard to remember how we (Apple Music) got here without
          embarking upon some gargantuan <emphasis>A Complete Visual

          be said that Tim Cook's ‚Äúnext chapter in music‚Äù has become a
          sad afterthought. As far as I understand it, the ‚Äústreaming
          war‚Äù between Apple and Spotify has long since gone
          definitively to the latter in statistical terms, which I'd
          suggest to be an overall positive outcome for Apple Music

          My Apple Music library has become quite fragmented after I
          lost my entire physical music collection along with the
          external drives containing my accumulated digital music
          library in 2017. Still, after more or less starting anew this
          past December and casually, deliberately adding digital files
          back into the accursed, ancient iTunes desktop application and
          restoring some (outdated) versions of my handful of shared
          curatorial playlists thanks to SongShift (which we'll glance
          on later,) MusicHarbor currently lists 1433 artists
          represented across my Apple Music and (very sparse) Spotify
          libraries. I know this because of
          <link xlink:href="https://routinehub.co/shortcut/8935/">a very
          simple Siri Shortcut</link> I modified which returns a text
          list of all Artists in one's MusicHarbor library in Quick
          Look.

          is my result</link> as of this moment in GitHub Gist form.)
          According my App Store receipts, I first downloaded
          MusicHarbor on March 26 ‚Äì 20 days ago ‚Äì which is mentionable
          because of how much I've accomplished with very minimal time
          investment in terms of curating my own music library thanks to
          MusicHarbor. As you'll note in the 3rd of the 4 screenshots
          embedded above, I was able to delete System of a Down from my
          library ‚Äì a single function which alone justifies the app's
          one-time $5.99 ‚ÄúUnlock Everything‚Äù fee, to my sensibility.
          I've also been able to begin following all the artists
          represented in a few of my favorite playlists with a handful
          of taps ‚Äì a task which would literally require hours in the
          native Apple Music app of old (when one could actually follow
          artists, there.) On that note, it's time to cite the primary
          <emphasis>MacStories</emphasis> article you should read,
          entitled
          ‚Äú<link xlink:href="https://www.macstories.net/ios/how-i-keep-track-of-new-music-releases/">How

            The ‚ÄòNew Releases‚Äô section is tucked at the very end of the

            requires a lot of swiping; you can view the ‚ÄòNew Releases‚Äô
            page as a grid, which has sections for different weeks, but,
            in my experience, it only aggregates highlights for new
            releases from some of my favorite artists. The ‚ÄòNew Music
            Mix‚Äô playlist is not terrible, but it often comes loaded
            with stale data ‚Äì songs I‚Äôve already listened to multiple
            times and which shouldn‚Äôt qualify as ‚Äúnew‚Äù weeks after their
            original release date. Furthermore, I‚Äôve found notifications
            for new releases for artists in my library unreliable at
            best: I occasionally get notifications for new albums, but
            never for new singles or EPs.

          almost two years old, MusicHarbor remains the ultimate means
          of tracking new music releases chronologically on Apple's
          platforms. Though I am personally just three weeks in, the
          confidence this app has given me in the certainty of its
          chronological release feed is quite profound. Its integration

          releases is a bit much for my own needs, but I know personally

          MusicHarbor‚Äôs only downside is entirely

          ‚ÄúImmersive UI Tint‚Äù down to the hex (in ‚ÄúAlbum Settings‚Äù) is
          as in-depth a tool of adoration as I‚Äôve ever seen in a digital

          Public API</link>, dozens of Music-centric Siri Shortcuts have
          emerged over the past few years, resulting in one of the most
          useful Siri Shortcuts integrations to be found for real,
          reasonable human beings. Here‚Äôs where Apple-adjacent media and

          <link xlink:href="https://routinehub.co/shortcut/8940/">my
          own, 17-action Shortcut</link> which spares you any selections
          and simply opens the Song.Link URL of the track currently
          playing in Apple Music (while also copying said URL to the
          clipboard.) It‚Äôs not that MusicBot isn‚Äôt massively impressive
          and still useful, but it represents a class of
          super/hyper-Shortcuts which (from my perspective)
          <emphasis>far</emphasis>-overreach beyond the intended use
          case for Siri Shortcuts and end up immediately
          bewildering/alienating potential new users. Truthfully ‚Äì as
          Federico singularly acknowledges ‚Äì they are full
          <emphasis>applications</emphasis> built atop a less-than-ideal
          platform designed for relatively simple,
          <emphasis>repeatable</emphasis> automations. I‚Äôll spare you
          further opining on this idea until another, potential Post,
          and instead demonstrate my personal solution.

          In the clip above, you can see I was working on this very
          draft when LoneMoon‚Äôs
          ‚Äú<link xlink:href="https://song.link/i/1554970332">kawAii

          share it on Twitter, so ‚Äì without leaving Drafts (my writing
          app) ‚Äì I called the
          <link xlink:href="https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/siri-iphaff1d606/ios">type-to-Siri</link>
          prompt by holding the Sleep/Wake button on my iPhone 12 Pro
          Max and simply typed ‚Äúsl‚Äù (I renamed my Shortcut for this
          use,) running the Shortcut, which opened the track‚Äôs Song.Link
          page in Safari ‚Äì very much an optional step, mostly just to
          make sure the match is correct ‚Äì and copied its URL to my
          clipboard, from which I could share it anywhere. Since the
          advent of widgets in iOS‚Äô

          View</link>, I‚Äôve also kept a button for this Shortcut in one
          of four precious slots in a box at the very top. For those
          willing to play around a bit, it should be fairly
          straightforward to configure the end bits to your liking, but
          it should work out of the box for even those least interested
          in Siri Shortcuts/automation in general.

          a bit dated, but I don‚Äôt see much change in function in that

          best way to transfer a playlist between music streaming

          What if you actually want to ‚Äúmake‚Äù music with your iPhone?
          We‚Äôve seen iPhone television ads for years featuring
          amalgamations of musician-looking types playing instruments
          with cables attached to their handsets, but is the iPhone now
          a reasonable platform for any sort of serious sound capture?
          The short answer is <emphasis role="strong">no</emphasis>. Who
          am I to proclaim such an absolute? None other than the
          motherfucker who‚Äôs been messing around with mobile DAWs for

          on Bandcamp made exclusively with Apple‚Äôs own GarageBand for

          producer could pull off in the app, but it does represent its
          capabilities in the hands of the average user, using mostly
          default loops.

            The main technology behind audio zoom is called beamforming,

            to the direction of the sound source) and shape it in any
            way necessary. In this case, the optimal directivity is a
            hypercardioid pattern (see illustration below), which
            enhances sounds coming from the front direction ‚Äî that is,
            from the direction in which your camera is pointed ‚Äî while

          That said, the biggest objection I‚Äôve heard from audiophiles
          regarding audio capture and manipulation on handsets,
          generally, has to do with their hardware‚Äôs extremely limited
          capabilities when compared to any sort of professional desktop
          soundcard. Given the greater argument I've come to regarding
          the state of consumer tech as best exemplified by smartphone
          design ‚Äì that we've come to expect <emphasis>far</emphasis>
          too much of single devices, and the resulting
          jack-of-all-tradeness summing their real-life capabilities has
          become a <emphasis role="strong">severe detriment</emphasis>
          instead of a feature ‚Äì I must echo, again, that adding
          ‚Äústudio‚Äù audio capture, manipulation, and production

        from iTunes (the software) and allowed to use a much more modern
        Apple Music experience. I prepended ‚Äúofficially,‚Äù there, because
        third-party Apple Music web players have existed as long as the
        service has allowed the required integration. First, there was

        is still <link xlink:href="https://musi.sh/">live and
        working</link>, as you can see from the screenshot embedded
        above. Other than the ability to select between two stream
        bitrates, I can't seen any remaining advantages to using the
        latter over Apple's own web player, unless you harbor spite
        toward their handling of the whole thing, which would be
        entirely understandable, from my perspective.

        As someone who grew up in the mp3 era with a
        <link xlink:href="https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/1359364473253937153">first-generation
        iPod Shuffle</link> and iTunes, living and dying between iTunes
        Store gift cards, Apple Music still seems like one hell of a
        magical deal. In effect, it allows access to <emphasis>all of
        iTunes</emphasis> for a flat monthly fee. Or at least it
        <emphasis>would</emphasis> had I never become acquainted with
        professional independent musicians who've published, there, and
        have to contend with tedious realities like
        <link xlink:href="https://artists.apple.com/support/675-send-your-lyrics-to-apple-music">the
        process by which one can add those beautiful lyrics to Apple
        Music tracks</link>, and who's only real means of
        control/engagement on the service has been removed with
        virtually zero prospects of a replacement. If, indeed, Jessica
        Lessin was correct about Apple's obsession with music, it has
        resulted in very little for any class of music makers, and left
        even its listeners to seek out and find third-party solutions
        like MusicHarbor to perform even the most basic personalization
        one expects from a modern music streaming service without even
        bothering to amend their App Store's discovery process to
        illuminate them, or even write a fucking App Story. Despite
        this, one-to-three-person app teams continue to work on new
        solutions, to these and other problems...

      <title>The first release version of my only original contribution
      to the iOS community is now ready to assist when you can't find
      your phone.</title>
      <para>
        One of the handful of Siri's most useful features has been the
        ‚ÄúHey Siri! Where are you?‚Äù command, to which Siri will respond
        ‚ÄúI'm here‚Äù or ‚Äúhere I am!‚Äù Were it possible to view how many
        times one has triggered a particular Siri command on iOS, my
        personal reliance on it would almost certainly be embarrassing.
        Often, my handset isn't even obscured from view ‚Äì it's just
        faster to have Siri speak up than it is to scan the room.
        Occasionally, however, my device has managed to become embedded
        beneath and/or within some genuinely-perplexing series of couch
        cushions/blankets/briefcase pockets/etc. which require a more
        constant homing sort of audio reproduction. Asking
        friends/family to call one's phone is the general goto, yes, but
        honestly the actual length of time cellular telephones will ring
        before sending a caller to voicemail in 2021 is
        <emphasis>ridiculously</emphasis> short, especially when
        rummaging through Gourd-knows-what. For that matter, most of my
        peers keep their phones on silent mode, 24/7. What then?

        Since
        <link xlink:href="https://bilge.world/siri-shortcuts-ios12-review">the
        very first time</link> I set eyes upon Siri Shortcuts in iOS 12
        Beta, I have wanted to create one to address this issue in a
        creative, entertaining, and (hopefully) genuinely-useful way. On
        that day almost three years ago, I even knew it would be called
        <emphasis>Marco!</emphasis>, believe it or not. In the past few
        months, I've returned to the project on and off and ended up
        with several different versions of varying complexity. One day,
        I'd like to figure out how to integrate the full extent of my
        ideas for Marco! into a Shortcut which can be reliably triggered
        when one's device is locked, but for this first release version,
        I have included only what I and a few other (much appreciated)
        volunteers were able to trigger in every situation we could
        conceive of.

        Marco! Version 1.0 can be downloaded on

        excessive, but I even created a
        <link xlink:href="https://github.com/extratone/marco">GitHub
        Repository</link> just for this Shortcut, seeing as it is
        undoubtedly the most original I will ever contribute, and the
        singular one with potential for continued development.

      <para>
        Download Marco! as is and (as long as you don't rename it) use
        ‚ÄúHey Siri!... Marco!‚Äù This should immediately run the Shortcut,
        which includes my voice saying ‚ÄúPolo! Bitch!‚Äù followed by five
        repeats of the flashlight/noise cycle as described in detail

        The most clever bit about this particular Shortcut is its use of
        Base64 text to include audio playback. I just fixed a bug on

        Base64 audio encoder Shortcut</link> if you'd like to try it
        out. Since this version includes my own voice (subject to taste,
        I realize,) as well as some minor profanity, I do intend to
        publish a clean variation at some point in the future. If this
        is an obstacle for you, and/or if you'd like a custom version
        made with audio of your own choosing, please do send me an email
        (<email>davidblue@extratone.com</email>)! I would be more than
        happy to make one for you.

        I have written more than my fair share of words about software,
        as I have loved, despised, and been utterly perplexed by it.
        This year, my return to the iOS community has perhaps inevitably
        turned <emphasis>apps</emphasis> into an addiction of sorts.
        This particular platform is so utterly chock full/stocked up of
        creativity at a scale immeasurably greater and more accessible
        than the whole of those throughout computing history, combined.
        For someone like myself, it is all too easy to allow oneself to
        wander down a virtually endless path of intriguing, very
        self-indulgent play, especially now that third-party sites like
        <link xlink:href="https://departures.to">Departures.to</link>
        have managed to add discoverability to TestFlight beta
        distributions, allowing those non-millionaires among us
        opportunities to use test releases of applications we would‚Äôve
        otherwise had to pay for. This has been exclusively to my
        benefit ‚Äì I can only imagine what 15 year-old me would have done
        with such power.

        In my recent endeavor to focus on making my work more useful to
        others, I've reflected on something I've heard from nigh every
        developer of the apps I've reviewed: <emphasis>Ah yes, your blog
        looks really cool but FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, PLEASE REVIEW MY
        FUCKING APP on the FUCKING STORE.</emphasis> Read: your

        As you can see from the image embedded above, I have personally
        fallen <emphasis>very</emphasis> behind in doing my part for
        those apps I've celebrated, here. A vague intention to
        <emphasis>get around to it eventually</emphasis> clearly is not
        working, so I've decided to give myself a deadline:
        <emphasis role="strong">August 15th, 2021</emphasis> ‚Äì precisely
        one month from today. By this date, I will have sifted through
        my commentary on apps in this setting and adapted the most
        useful of it (per app, obviously) into a manner appropriate to
        appear on an App Store Page, and <emphasis role="strong">I would
        like to formally-ish invite other tech writers/app reviewers to
        join me</emphasis>.

        I'm terrible at community organization, which certainly does not

        have, as well as any collaborative contributions you'd be
        interested in making. As I see it, I have a few essential
        considerations to offer.

        First, the page in the screen capture above ‚Äì which can be found
        in the App Store App ‚á® Account (your profile picture in the

        and Reviews ‚Äì is <emphasis>broken as hell</emphasis>, along with
        the rest of the Account Settings menu, notably. This is
        important because I insist we all complain about it on all
        available channels, considering it's been broken for several
        months, at least.

        Second, you should almost certainly use

        Since the standard online palette of event organization software
        are all so easy to use, these days, I've established event pages
        for this event on multiple platforms, linked in the list below,

        Apple's second virtual World Wide Developer Conference came and
        went as I wrote this guide ‚Äì you can metaphorically picture me

        The continued prioritization of Growth for Growth's sake over

        at this point in the story who is catastrophically and
        demonstrably failing to fulfill their role: all I really know is
        that technology media has fallen into a trough of total
        uselessness when it comes to qualitative, authoritative analysis
        of consumer-targeted software. The necessity of this guide ‚Äì and

        Despite how deeply I've gone into iOS this year, I do not
        believe myself to be a qualified judge of software design, but I
        no longer believe Apple to be, either. Regardless of the
        revenue-related controversies of late, Apple have simply become
        terrible stewards of the App Store in every imaginable sense.
        Scams and blatant intellectual property theft abound, while the
        majority of the most innovative entries I've ever seen remain
        entirely obfuscated and uncelebrated by all of Apple. Inc.'s
        mechanisms. If you required an explanation for the amount of
        time I've invested into App Guides ‚Äì a space to which I never
        would have imagined intentionally bringing <emphasis>The

      <para>
        I must confess: I have been <emphasis>meaning</emphasis> to
        write this app guide since even before I
        <link xlink:href="https://bilge.world/eugen-rochko-interview">interviewed
        Mastodon creator Eugen Rochko</link> on the morning of his Big
        Press Day, just over 4 years ago. I‚Äôve exhaustively explored
        different means of convincing my own longtime Twitter friends to
        move, over that time, with very little success. Eugen, himself,
        published an
        <link xlink:href="https://blog.joinmastodon.org/2021/02/developing-an-official-ios-app-for-mastodon/">official
        blog post</link> at the beginning of February detailing his
        plans to open up onboarding by way of ‚Äúan official Mastodon app
        that is free to download and that is specialized in helping new
        users get started on the platform.‚Äù As a Patreon supporter of
        <link xlink:href="https://www.patreon.com/mastodon">The Mastodon
        Project</link> (full disclosure,) I've been testing this app
        (see preview shots at the very end,) and am quite smitten with
        it. That said, I thought it might be worth going over the
        third-party options iOS users currently have available to them,
        largely because the offerings are each innovative and mature
        applications in their own right. (Also, it‚Äôs become quite
        apparent that the normal tech media sources you‚Äôd go to for such
        a guide aren‚Äôt going to give Mastodon the attention it
        deserves.)

        I originally intended to be as clinical as possible in this
        Post, having realized its potential as the singular comparison
        of its kind to appear in search results for new and potential
        users of Mastodon. From my perspective, Mastodon has long since
        surpassed regard as a novel social media experiment who's
        function is to prompt academic conversations about
        decentralization, open source, ad tech, and federated social's
        solutions to all of the Big Web's Big Boy (proprietary) Problems
        (though I have been compelled to
        <link xlink:href="https://github.com/extratone/bigblue">invest
        significantly</link> in that very conversation.) In the less
        intellectual hours of my day-to-day life (read: most of the
        time,) Mastodon is nothing more or less than my favorite place
        on the internet. It is a relentless delight which I only lament
        because I want to share so much of it with my friends, but have
        continued to fail in my efforts to articulate that

        If you didn't know, this seems to have become <emphasis>my

        <emphasis>Oh boy, here we go...</emphasis> No. I did not want to

        to the tune of ‚Äúis there an iPhone app?‚Äù As I explored them,
        however, I was reminded of the sheer creativity the
        ‚Äúalternative‚Äù software community is capable of. Even the
        roughest of these considered apps seem unable to be faceless ‚Äì
        sorting through the obscene amount of (unlabeled) screenshots
        accumulated over the past weeks of testing in my Recents folder
        has been <emphasis>so</emphasis> much easier than I thought it
        would be because of their relentless originality. If you've
        actually used any iOS applications and/or browsed the singular
        App Store from which they can be acquired in the past 3-4 years,
        you're undoubtedly skeptical: what we might have called ‚Äúfeature
        overlap‚Äù at one time has become all but the platform's core
        ethos. If you're the sort who enjoys screwing around with apps,
        generally, as I have for the whole of iPhone history, you have
        grown accustomed to disappointment.

      <para>
        Regardless of who is to blame, we can all agree that the App
        Store is currently oversaturated nigh <emphasis>beyond
        usability</emphasis> with mediocre entries built from the
        beginning with zero apparent ambition toward original function.
        This, alone, wouldn't be so problematic if Discovery were not so

        <link xlink:href="https://tools.applemediaservices.com/app-store/">dev-facing</link>,)
        but I needn't comment further on that subject at the moment ‚Äì
        I'm just trying emphasize how absolutely unheard of it is for a
        single protocol/service's third-party client representation on
        iOS to be so thoroughly special. It was astonishing to find all
        but one or two of these apps <emphasis>in a functional
        state</emphasis>, actually. In all my equivalent experiences
        downloading the entirety of a given service's API-supported
        palette (e.g. IRC apps,
        <link xlink:href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/pkbgvg/major-internet-projects-are-leaving-freenode-after-korean-prince-takeover">topically</link>,)
        an all-too-significant purpose of whatever ends up getting
        published is simply documenting the ~20% of available titles
        that <emphasis>actually work</emphasis> at the given moment.
        (I'd have mentioned the ‚Äúbest [service/task] iPhone apps for
        [year]‚Äù listicles found in online publications like
        <emphasis>Digital Trends</emphasis> were it not for the
        percentage of them in which it's clear the author <emphasis>did
        not actually download</emphasis> some/most of the apps
        listed‚ÄΩ‚ÄΩ‚ÄΩ) Perhaps due to
        <link xlink:href="https://www.wsj.com/video/series/joanna-stern-personal-technology/apple-software-chief-explains-ios-145-defends-companys-reach-exclusive/57D138E3-3677-4A78-9534-62DAD443FE97">iOS

        could find and test (not counting non-English
        language-supporting apps, in fairness' interest) are currently
        functioning.
      </para>
      <para>
        So, if there's virtually zero chance a new Mastodon user might
        download one of the apps we're about to consider and find it
        broken, what practical function remains for this guide?
        Hopefully, to establish a SEO catch-all for such users from a
        non-automated source less associated with the project than the
        official apps list. Those for whom Mastodon is still an
        unfamiliar subject should find the collected imagery intriguing,
        hopefully.

          The Original‚Ä¶ Genesis‚Ä¶ If Amaroq was not the first Mastodon
          app on the App Store, it‚Äôs certainly the oldest to survive.
          Its GitHub Repository‚Äôs
          <link xlink:href="https://github.com/ReticentJohn/Amaroq/commit/9648ebdecf8ab20819ba10fe18b6317a8026fd86">first
          commit</link> dates back to April 17th, 2017. While you‚Äôre
          there, you might note that it‚Äôs the only one of these entries
          coded entirely in Objective-C ‚Äì the near-40-year-old language
          originally underpinning iOS before Swift‚Äôs birth in 2014.
          Amaroq was the first Mastodon app I used and remains the
          strongest free option for iOS users. It‚Äôs been nearly a year
          since its last update, so its missing a few narrower functions
          like Bookmarking and Polls, but the core features it
          <emphasis>does</emphasis> include are rock solid. The only
          wild card: what the fuck is Awoo Mode???

          Daniel Nitsikopoulos'
          <link xlink:href="https://onmercury.app">Mercury</link>
          represents yet another entirely original direction in Social

          ‚Äú<link xlink:href="https://onmercury.app/help">promote abuse

          Unfortunately, the state of Mercury's App Store reviews prompt
          yet another essential economic/editorial consideration. The
          one in the very center of the image embedded, above ‚Äì from
          ‚ÄúFeralDandelion‚Äù ‚Äì is the singular one I will allow myself to
          address. It is true that Mercury straight up refuses to
          authenticate or federate with a substantial amount of specific
          Mastodon servers, but it is
          <emphasis role="strong">exhaustively explicit about this from
          very get-go</emphasis>. Its
          <link xlink:href="https://onmercury.app/help">single-page Help
          document</link> includes a detailed, up-to-date table of every
          single blocked instance and <emphasis>the specific
          justification</emphasis> for each respective instance's
          presence on it:
        </para>
        <blockquote>
          <para>
            Mercury takes a zero tolerance stance on abuse and
            harassment and as such does not support many instances that
            promote abuse and harassment.
          </para>
        </blockquote>
        <para>
          Let me be clear: the practical manifestation of this position
          is <emphasis role="strong">exclusively positive</emphasis>.
          The Mastodon project has long outgrown the sort of fixation on
          ideology for ideology's sake that even Lucky Linus himself has
          no patience for. Instead, <emphasis>thank Gourd</emphasis>
          Mercury's developers took the time to better your social
          experience! In response to statements like the pullquote
          above, I expect *<emphasis role="strong">only* thumbs in the
          air</emphasis> from this point, forward.

          Metatext is perhaps the buzziest of all these apps ‚Äì
          well-praised in every space I could find conversation on the
          subject. It's developed under
          <link xlink:href="https://mastodon.social/@jzzocc">Justin

          <link xlink:href="https://metabolist.org/">Metabolist</link>

          noted that ‚Äúit looks like a native app on both iOS and

          inextricably linked with Metatext. I vaguely understand what
          it means, and I do agree, but it's worth noting that I speak
          with some privilege, having compared all of these apps on the
          top performing handset Apple currently has to offer. In many
          ways, it is the most frugal of the new offerings, especially,
          yet it strikes a keen balance between function and delight. I
          think ‚Äúnative‚Äù can be translated as <emphasis>generally of a
          stout, sturdy disposition</emphasis>, thanks to the care put
          into honing said balance.

          I'm not entirely positive which Mastodon app was

          in 14 months, yet the app ‚Äì which was apparently ‚ÄúDesigned for
          iPad‚Äù ‚Äì appears to be working just fine. There are some
          overlapping UI elements, but they're barely noticeable. Were
          it not for the new dev-facing store search tool mentioned

          Personally, I find this a profound shame ‚Äì I think more apps
          should be as colorful ‚Äì and as color
          <emphasis>configurable</emphasis> ‚Äì as this little, mysterious
          Mastodon app. I created the theme you see represented in the
          frames embedded above using <emphasis>The Psalms</emphasis>
          colors, naturally, and the whole process took less than five
          minutes. Play around with it as I remember doing, all those

          shame in, though, is that Tootle appears to be completely
          invisible in regular app store searches, now. (And by

        <para>
          Installing Roma for the first time led to a puzzling quest
          with a particularly pleasant end. I noticed fairly quickly
          that the iOS app was a re-branded release of what used to be
          Mast. My first instinct upon this discovery was to DM Mast's
          original developer,
          <link xlink:href="https://twitter.com/JPEGuin">Shihab
          Meboob</link>, on Twitter, but frankly, I've already bothered
          him enough there over the years, so it's understandable that I
          didn't hear back. When I downloaded the desktop app I found on
          <link xlink:href="https://www.roma.rocks/#desktop">Roma's web
          page</link> and noticed its similarity to
          <link xlink:href="https://whalebird.social/en/desktop/contents">Whalebird</link>,
          I decided to use the site's contact form to
          <link xlink:href="https://github.com/extratone/bilge/blob/main/correspondence/Roma%20Inquiry.md">inquire</link>
          about what exactly was going on as gingerly as I could.
          Happily, I received a reply just <emphasis>minutes</emphasis>
          later from Leo Radvinsky, head of

          <para>
            In both cases we funded the original developers of both Mast
            and Whalebird to create a branded whitelabel app specially
            made for Pleroma. The idea was to make Roma a cross platform
            brand/app. It didn't really work out so now we're working on
            a new app from scratch called Fedi for iOS and Android and
            releasing that as open source.

          Though my hopes for the original Mast to live on in Roma form
          were more or less dashed by this message, the suggestion that
          someone is investing <emphasis role="strong">actual
          capital</emphasis> into federated social is certainly worth
          celebrating. If Roma is still available on the App Store as
          you're reading this, I insist you download it immediately. It
          represents an incredible and original attention to detail
          which should not simply be forgotten.

        <para>
          Naturally, the app inheriting the work/resources established
          by Mast and Roma ‚Äì known by <emphasis>Fedi</emphasis> ‚Äì should
          be next up for discussion. Hopefully, my relative lack of
          experience with
          <link xlink:href="https://pleroma.social/">Pleroma</link> ‚Äì
          another ActivityPub-based, federated social network ‚Äì won't
          let you down, here. After a brief shock from the uniqueness of
          Fedi's UI passes, one immediately notices how beautifully it
          is animated, wholly disregarding my
          <link xlink:href="https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/1357394407201398791">recently-acquired</link>
          preference for as little animation as possible. Perhaps more
          than any other app discussed here, Fedi feels uncannily
          bespoke in a way which iOS apps almost never do. It is
          undoubtedly the result of a very specific vision ‚Äì to
          disregard the whole modern template for social apps and
          completely reimagine the archetype. Personally, I'm not sure
          if it would be easy to get used to, but my tastes/habits in
          this regard are very much the result of the past decade of
          proprietary social apps' blandness. Going forward with
          substantial financial backing and the talents of whoever it
          was that got it this far, no doubt we should all have very
          high hopes for Fedi.

          anything in between (at 40-Toot increments, anyway.) The

          social services (Twitter and Mastodon, in this case.) Without

          I very vaguely remember happening upon StarPterano in my very
          first moments on Mastodon, so finding it still published on
          the App Store ‚Äì buried as it was ‚Äì brought me a particular
          sort of joy. If I‚Äôm not mistaken, it holds a special personal
          accolade as the only iOS app which has caused me to
          involuntarily shriek. This might sound like an insult, but it
          is actually the peak of my praise. I believe my knowledge of
          iOS development safely allows me to suppose that StarPterano
          was built with complete disregard for any established UI
          element libraries. That is, the familiar toggles and buttons
          developers rely on to standardize the iOS experience were cast
          aside entirely in favor of handbuilt, translucent buttons of a
          sort of neon quality which call menus and text entry fields no
          less alien to the platform. The most astonishing bit, though,
          is that it <emphasis>works</emphasis>. On my 12 Pro Max, it‚Äôs
          exceptionally smooth, in fact.

          two apps I've come across in a very long time which allows one
          to post to both services simultaneously. Considerable work was
          obviously done on making its timeline-based tabs switchable
          with touch. Personally, I very much prefer my current

          a prominent social app in mainland China called Douban ‚Äì and
          the ‚ÄúDouban Refugees‚Äù which resulted ‚Äì are alarmingly missing

          2019. He eludes to a ‚Äúboom‚Äù of Mastodon adoption in the past
          few years and cites a lack of ‚Äúuser friendly mobile clients‚Äù

        A few universal truths among these apps stand out as obligatory
        mentions. First ‚Äì in comparison with their Proprietary, Big

        <emphasis>ridiculously</emphasis>
        <emphasis role="strong">frugal</emphasis>. Not a one weighs over

        <link xlink:href="https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/1393294957352468494">often
        exceed 100mb</link>. They are all astonishingly
        <emphasis role="strong">robust</emphasis> ‚Äì I did not experience
        a single crash in the course of normal testing these ‚Äúalt‚Äù
        social apps- even from the beta builds ‚Äì while I distinctly
        remember the official Twitter app crashing several times over
        this period, even after I deleted and reinstalled it (an
        accepted maintenance requirement for anyone using it heavily for
        its entire history.) Also, on the topic of the platform, itself,
        they are also made absurdly
        <emphasis role="strong">interoperable</emphasis> by the

        The overwhelming impression I was left with after testing these
        apps was one of unwavering competence, cleverness, and true
        innovation. How many different ways can I possibly conjure forth
        in order to communicate this? I, David Blue ‚Äì the vain fucker

        This couldn't be ‚Äújust‚Äù an app guide ‚Äì I think I have thoroughly
        accepted this, by now, just in time for some conclusionary
        remarks. Somehow, the subject I originally tackled specifically
        because I thought it would be quick, rudimentary, and
        straightforward has become yet another personal journey. It'd
        feel a bit preposterous to declare any one of these apps to be
        <emphasis>life-changing</emphasis>, but ‚Äì in every sense of the
        term, in contemporary, inevitably social media-informed life,
        they do indeed constitute a form of radical, ideological
        wellness. Each of them managed to remind me of a different
        minute delight found within a developer-user dynamic made up of
        thoughtful and effective minds working to contribute original
        and valuable experiences, first. Most noteworthy of these little
        freedoms: the realization that the upcoming ‚Äúofficial‚Äù Mastodon
        app along with any future new options are exclusively a positive
        thing <emphasis>for the user</emphasis>... None of these apps
        were conceived to gobble up market share because the market is
        fundamentally, inevitably, uncompromisingly <emphasis>infinitely
        shared</emphasis>. I don't know anything about business, but I
        <emphasis>do</emphasis> know that relief from the burden of
        considering proprietary multivectored development intentions has
        been personally breathtaking. I can only hope the reciprocal
        compensation is happening at even a fraction of what it ‚Äúshould‚Äù
        be.

        From another essential direction, I hope I have communicated
        that they're far from curious, ‚Äúniche‚Äù or vanity side projects,
        now. When I used the term ‚Äúmature‚Äù in introducing this little
        arena, I very much meant it ‚Äì these ‚Äúalt‚Äù social clients
        developed almost exclusively within single-person-led projects
        now make the Twitter for iOS app look ugly
        <emphasis>and</emphasis> fucking broken. ‚ÄúGiving social
        networking back to you‚Äù has never been more resonant. Yes, it
        really is Toot!'s ‚Äútake a break‚Äù blue screen, Amaroq's
        mysterious Awoo mode toggle, iMast's music app integration,
        Mercury's configurable timelines, Metatext's native solidity,
        Tootle's custom colors, Tusker's Digital Wellness controls,
        DUDU's elemental readability, Roma's quiet resurrection of
        Mast's UI bravado, Stella's utterly bizarre visual departures,
        Fedi's odd animated UI behaviors, Tootoise's consideration of
        <emphasis>pace</emphasis>, B4X's unfathomable elements, Ore2's
        parallel timelines, tooot's development story, and Oyakodon's
        adorable rough edges that have made my online life
        <emphasis>measurably</emphasis>...
        <emphasis>immensely</emphasis> better, these past weeks. At the
        forefront of this perception is undoubtedly the comparatively
        extensive <emphasis>control</emphasis> over my social experience

          Commander-in-Chief Eugen Rochko and his team developed a
          whole, exceptional iOS app in the span of time it took me to
          write the

          announcement of the ‚Äúofficial‚Äù Mastodon app‚Äôs
          development</link> on the official Mastodon blog. ‚ÄúWe need an

          specialized in helping new users get started on the platform,‚Äù

          up newcomers.‚Äù My first thought regarding the idea of an app

          jumped to the assumption that such a design choice would
          result in a less-than-ideal experience for those of us who

      <para>
        First, we‚Äôre presented with a list of Mastodon instances
        (servers,) organized by category. Those friends of mine to whom
        I‚Äôve failed to ‚Äúsell‚Äù Mastodon have cited server selection as a
        major obstacle of confusion and I can‚Äôt imagine a better means
        of addressing it than the tool offered by this app. It‚Äôs
        beautiful and fast in a way previous utilities ‚Äì like
        <link xlink:href="https://instances.social">instances.social</link>
        ‚Äì cannot be, especially for those most lacking in attention.
        Once we‚Äôve chosen a server, we are immediately presented up
        front with a clearly readable document containing the ‚Äúground
        rules‚Äù set by its administrators. In my experience, these rules
        tend to be notably
        <emphasis role="strong">easy-to-understand</emphasis> and
        <emphasis role="strong">not open to interpretation</emphasis>,
        as if they were written primarily in the interest of community
        wellness rather than to construct a defense from legal action.
      </para>
      <para>
        After we‚Äôve agreed to the relevant terms of the server we‚Äôve
        chosen, it‚Äôs on to account creation, which offers the options to
        which citizens of the social web have become accustomed ‚Äì
        profile picture, username, email address, and password ‚Äì but
        notably without the
        <link xlink:href="https://gimletmedia.com/shows/reply-all/n8hxzr7/176-twicarus">inexplicable
        errors</link> exhibited for years in Big Social‚Äôs equivalent
        functions. Immediately following this frame, we are prompted to
        check our inboxes for a confirmation link. The explanation for
        my dramatic exclamation in the demo video comes down to Mastodon
        for iOS‚Äô implementation of the operating system's intra-app
        linking function (with the syntax
        <literal>mastodon://</literal>,) which (in my experience) is
        hardly ever utilized correctly. The result is that I was able to
        click the incoming confirmation link within Outlook for iOS and
        then proceed <emphasis>within the Mastodon app</emphasis>
        instead of being bounced off to a web browser. This integration
        should not be remarkable, but ‚Äì in the context of iOS
        development as it stands in 2021 ‚Äì it most certainly is.
      </para>
      <para>
        After confirmation, we are offered the option to explore the
        app‚Äôs ‚ÄúFind people to follow‚Äù function, which is informed by ‚Äúa
        mix of most followed accounts and most-engaged-with accounts
        from recent times that post primarily in your language,‚Äù as
        <link xlink:href="https://mastodon.social/@Gargron/106674282886448440">Eugen
        explained</link> in response to an earlier draft of this post.
        Indeed, the remarkably relevant results offered to me in the
        demo were not actually remarkable at all: I just know a lot of
        folks on mastodon.online ‚Äì especially those who post the most.
        That's the whole bit! If you need ‚Äúproof,‚Äù

        One of the distinctly missing functions among the breadth of
        third-party offerings has been the ability to edit one's profile
        information from within the app. Mastodon for iOS addresses this
        in a particularly visually impressive way (see image embedded
        above.) Some also have yet to be updated with support for Polls,
        which the new app encompasses in a manner that puts Big Social's
        equivalents to shame. The ability to vertically drag individual
        options in the compose interface, for instance, reflects insight
        only gained by <emphasis>actually using these
        features</emphasis>. The result is definitively the best means
        of crafting a Mastodon poll, for what that's worth.

          As of this writing, Mastodon for iOS also includes Siri

        Adi Robinson</link>, which notes the omission of local/federated
        ‚Äúfirehose‚Äù timeline views out of a desire to ‚Äúreduce the
        potential for conflict with Apple.‚Äù (see: the Inc.‚Äôs
        <link xlink:href="https://litchie.com/2021/07/idos2-will-be-gone">blatantly
        inconsistent enforcement</link> of its store policies in the
        past few months.) As a Mastodon user who
        <emphasis>does</emphasis> occasionally engage with my local and
        federated timelines, I find this decision reasonable considering
        the wellspring of third-party apps on iOS which
        <emphasis>do</emphasis> support said views and the app‚Äôs
        explicit focus on brand new, fragile users. My personal
        experience disagrees with Eugen‚Äôs description of these timelines
        as a suboptimal means of capital-D Discovery, however,
        considering I‚Äôve found ~70-80% of
        <link xlink:href="https://github.com/extratone/bilge/blob/main/curation/mastodonfollowing.csv">the
        600+ accounts I follow</link>, there. (Though it should be noted

      </para>
      <para>
        Though the onboarding process‚Äô people to follow finder is pretty
        darn stellar, I worry that our hypothetical new user has a high
        chance of landing on a more-or-less empty timeline. (For many,
        I‚Äôm sure this would be a welcome relief, at least initially.) A
        well-limited Local timeline view, at least, might prove a
        valuable upcoming addition. Regardless, I am 100% positive these
        omissions from the <emphasis>initial release</emphasis> version
        of this iOS app do not constitute some new ideological
        opposition to the greater concept of Federation.

        Naturally, a recurring complaint about the app is already
        surfacing in hashtag iOS on the Fediverse:
        <link xlink:href="https://mastodon.social/@wiredfire/106672087623244223">no
        multiple account support</link>?! Perhaps you‚Äôve already written
        me off as a mindless devotee, but ‚Äì especially after exploring
        <link xlink:href="https://github.com/extratone/FediiOS">the
        whole breadth of Mastodon apps available on iOS</link> (all of
        which support multiple accounts) ‚Äì the significance of this
        omission as a target for gripes seems laughably minuscule.
        Considering I have yet to delete any of the 20 apps I tested, I
        personally feel <emphasis>pretty well covered</emphasis> when it
        comes to checking my (embarrassingly numerous) alt accounts.
        It‚Äôd be one thing if longtime users/powerusers were left wanting
        for available apps designed for us, but we have a more diverse,
        quality palette to choose from than any other social media
        protocol. To decry this app ‚Äì which was explicitly designed from
        the very beginning for new users ‚Äì for skipping a function
        offered by <emphasis>more than a dozen alternatives</emphasis>
        is patently absurd. If you‚Äôve got multiple accounts you feel the
        need to check regularly, order them by frequency, authenticate
        all but number one in the free, dependable

        The ‚Äúrelentless originality‚Äù I spoke of in my
        <emphasis>third-party</emphasis> showcase is no less exemplified
        in this first-party Mastodon app. Its color palette is a welcome
        departure from Tootsuite‚Äôs (the mother web application,) while
        still remaining definitively recognizable. The artwork dispersed
        throughout the app is adorable, as you‚Äôve seen, and its bespoke

        Custom audio notifications especially stood out among those

        <para>
          An important consideration to inform the perspective through
          which we analyze such an app, I‚Äôd argue, is that
          <emphasis role="strong">this app could have been very
          bad</emphasis>. Those who bewilderingly measure the success of
          social networking services/protocols by their profit growth
          viability, alone, may well suggest it
          <emphasis>should</emphasis> have been bad. Had it been just
          mediocre, half-assed, and/or full of bugs, I‚Äôm sure I would
          still have paused everything to write and publish this review.
          The reality, though, is nothing less than exceptional. Unlike
          some of the third-party examples I discussed, I would argue
          Mastodon for iPhone to be an ‚Äúobjectively‚Äù excellent piece of
          software in that I cannot imagine any one sort of iPhone user
          <emphasis>not</emphasis> finding it refreshing in some way.
        </para>
        <para>
          I would sincerely worry for the person who feels nothing at
          all from the artwork, the bespoke UI, or the general care
          exhibited in its craftsmanship, <emphasis>but</emphasis> they
          wouldn‚Äôt have exhausted reasons to use it. From the very first
          beta release I installed to the first release version pushed
          to the App Store just yesterday, the app has
          <emphasis>never</emphasis> crashed, and the single bug I
          encountered was documented and fixed before I had time to
          begin a feedback report. While Twitter‚Äôs official iOS app does
          include a few Siri Shortcuts actions, they are all made
          immediately useless by a universal command to open the app,
          itself. Remove the obsessive insistence that any/all functions
          only be performed with your app in focus ‚Äì even when it surely
          makes no difference to your ad tech mechanism ‚Äì and you have
          Mastodon‚Äôs single action, ‚ÄúShow When Run‚Äù toggle included.
        </para>
        <para>
          I‚Äôm not sure what I expected from an ‚Äúofficial‚Äù Mastodon app
          upon first reading that winter blog post, but what I‚Äôve been
          delivered is quite a gem. Regardless of how its specific
          feature omissions may strike your ideological organ(s,) you
          cannot deny that great time and energy was invested in this
          app.

        <link xlink:href="https://help.twitter.com/en/using-twitter/twitter-follow-limit">this
        help document</link>. Considering the breadth of the mechanic's
        significance for other users, I have often been compelled to
        explain this to new followers. Recently, it occurred to me that
        a handy, brief explainer page might streamline this process, so
        I created
        ‚Äú<link xlink:href="https://gist.github.com/extratone/8b762de50de414f8a4be05f9b0407fd8">Why
        I Didn't Follow You Back</link>‚Äù ‚Äì in both GitHub Gist and
        Medium post form. Other than a lack of reciprocity in engagement
        which I can only speculate to occur in the minds of the opposite
        parties involved in this dynamic, this limitation does not
        detract from my Twitter life, as I exclusively consume content
        in Twitter Lists (which I have spoken about extensively,
        elsewhere.)

        A big theme in my 20s has been coming (slowly) to terms with the
        fact that I built my entire adult social life around a single,
        centralized social media Web Site. I mentioned this in
        <link xlink:href="https://bilge.world/tweetbot-6-ios-review">my
        Tweetbot 6 review</link>, recently, but ‚Äì as I also strive to be
        a more sincere person and spend more time adding value to
        <emphasis>others</emphasis>‚Äô lives ‚Äì I‚Äôve concluded that it is
        the time now to speak as openly and vulnerably as I can about my
        ‚ÄúSocial Media Methodology.‚Äù Most of the resulting insights will
        not be new information, but I continue to encounter greater and
        greater confusion in the face of my well-meaning behavior online
        and I have decided to stop disregarding it.

        challenged my assumptions about its <emphasis>actual

        long thought you were entirely alone in? What exactly have you
        being doing with all that tapping since your toddlerhood,

        Over the past few months, I've started a few Posts for this blog
        regarding Twitter, its properties, and its recent feature
        addition frenzy which I'll probably never finish. I finished the
        first and narrowest one ‚Äì the aforelinked Tweetbot 6 review ‚Äì
        but the (debatably) most important one ‚Äì highlighting how
        irresponsibly and distastefully
        <link xlink:href="https://github.com/extratone/bilge/issues/79">Twitter
        butchered Periscope and built Spaces atop its technology</link>
        ‚Äì would make less and less sense as time goes on. I definitely
        got caught up in the ‚Äúdeath‚Äù of the live video streaming
        service, fueled by my now quite old desire to celebrate it,
        which I will hopefully accomplish
        <emphasis>eventually</emphasis> in a very sentimental essay. If
        I can successfully link them editorially, the subject
        encompassing Spaces ‚Äì social audio's ‚Äúmoment‚Äù ‚Äì would also
        include mention of RSS, ‚ÄúPodcasting‚Äù (the term describing the
        medium,) Spotify, and Clubhouse, inevitably. Instead of counting
        on my future self entirely, however, I'm going to begin by
        discussing that last one.

        Exactly one month ago, I finally
        <link xlink:href="https://www.joinclubhouse.com/@davidblue">broke
        into Clubhouse</link> thanks to a random kind stranger on
        Twitter who preferred not to be named. April 25th was the first
        time I set eyes on the app ‚Äì though I could've (and usually
        would've) looked up screenshots and/or browsed the litter of how
        tos available, I did not. By this time, I'd accumulated quite a
        bit of experience with Twitter Spaces ‚Äì derided universally by
        tech media as a ‚ÄúClubhouse clone‚Äù ‚Äì and therefore assumed the
        original would be ‚Äúbetter,‚Äù at least in pure feature terms. What
        I found, however, was even <emphasis>less</emphasis> evidence
        that anyone building Clubhouse has been/is/intends to be a
        regular Clubhouse user. Spaces, at least, included five emoji
        reacts for listeners from the beginning: üíØ‚úä‚úåÔ∏èüëãüòÇ. Clubhouse's
        exclusive means of Listener-Host interaction is Hand Raising,
        which is essentially requesting to speak, even though the hand
        waving emoji is
        <emphasis><link xlink:href="https://joinclubhouse.com/press">literally

        In case you weren't aware, I appear to enjoy trying out new
        social services. My password manager is full of literally
        thousands of credentials for social media apps/services/startups
        ‚Äì most of which have undoubtedly collapsed or been absorbed by a
        larger entity. Since generating said credentials has become such
        an easy process, especially, I tend to immediately sign up for
        an account on just about every one I hear about. (I even have
        <link xlink:href="https://parler.com/#/user/Extratone">a Parler
        profile</link> I cannot bear to actually look at.) Generally, I
        sign up, follow anyone I know from elsewhere if given an
        account-bridging option, poke around enough to figure out
        whether or not the service in question could add something to my
        online existence, and end up leaving for good. Most of these
        services are <emphasis>not</emphasis> unique in any way, to a
        perplexing degree. A few ‚Äì like Pinterest ‚Äì gain success
        separately as I give up on trying to integrate them into my
        life. The miniscule remaining percentage, though, end up
        becoming a part of my daily existence. The most
        <emphasis>recent</emphasis> of these dates back to April 2017,

          I probably shouldn't proclaim to be an authority on social
          audio, but I am definitely a veteran. From that context, I
          must say that Clubhouse is horribly unoriginal ‚Äì not only in
          the sense that ‚Äúsuccessful‚Äù business implementations of
          others', previous ideas tend to be diluted versions of the
          original, but almost pitifully so. I will commend the app's
          developers on their somewhat-thorough release notes (even
          though they can be viewed only when first opening the app
          after an update instead of <emphasis>in the designated space
          on the App Store</emphasis>,) but the extent of
          <emphasis>linkable</emphasis> Clubhouse documentation amounts
          to <link xlink:href="https://joinclubhouse.com/blog">eight

          for one month, I wonder what the fuck they've been doing since
          launch, given how sparsely-featured the app is at this moment.
          There are Notifications, Profiles, and Clubs ‚Äì the latter of
          which cannot be created until a user surpasses an unknown
          threshold of renown(?) on the app. Competent calendar
          integration may be the service's singular innovation, though
          support for Outlook has yet to be added. The Big Issue,
          though, is finding a ‚Äútalk‚Äù to attend that will not drive you
          utterly insane...

          <link xlink:href="https://twitter.com/search?f=live&amp;pf=on&amp;q=%22joinclubhouse%22&amp;src=typed_query">this

          Messina</link> and
          <link xlink:href="https://twitter.com/Jason">Jason
          Calacanis</link>. This is noteworthy because I believe
          <link xlink:href="https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/following">my
          list of followed accounts on Twitter</link> to be particularly
          diverse. I actively followed accounts across my various
          interests from ages 15-25 (when I hit my
          <link xlink:href="https://bit.ly/dbfollow">follow
          limit</link>) and basically <emphasis>never unfollowed
          anyone</emphasis>. I would imagine there are several accounts
          within that list which I would be ashamed to be associated
          with, now, and yet none have shared a Clubhouse link. Reading
          any further into this observation would require actual data
          journalism, which I'll leave to the pros. It does prompt the
          question, though: if nobody I've ever known or been interested
          in on Twitter is using Clubhouse, <emphasis>who</emphasis> in
          fuck <emphasis>is</emphasis>?

          Frankly, I do not understand the business incentive behind the
          massive duplication of other software/services defining
          featuresets of late. I see that Instagram stories have
          eclipsed Snapchat's in terms of
          <link xlink:href="https://money.cnn.com/2018/06/28/technology/instagram-stories-users/index.html">sheer
          user count</link>, but I do not understand why its leaders
          would choose to fuck their legacy by such blatant idea theft,
          much less why
          <link xlink:href="https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/product/2020/introducing-fleets-new-way-to-join-the-conversation.html">Twitter</link>,
          <link xlink:href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/03/28/facebook-launches-stories-in-the-main-facebook-app">Facebook</link>,

          <link xlink:href="https://www.inputmag.com/culture/nobody-wants-stories-on-their-linkedin-feed">LinkedIn</link>
          have implemented nearly-identical featuresets. Though I know
          Ben Thompson's word on these matters should be easily
          digestible, I haven't been able to actually take a bite. For
          the End User, especially, I cannot even begin to conceive of
          what the leaders behind these decisions imagine the day-to-day
          experience of the average social media user looks like in the
          near future. <emphasis>How many apps</emphasis> am I going to
          cycle through to get a single story-type piece of content
          satisfactorily shared? Personally, I currently use three, and
          sharing a single bit individually across all of them
          one-by-one (since the current state of APIs is not conducive
          to consumer-targeted mass-sharing tools) makes me feel utterly
          insane.

          My lack of understanding would be meaningless if it were not
          so widely shared among my peers ‚Äì young, brilliant,

          my Mastodon friend
          <link xlink:href="https://radio.schizoid.tech/">Vanta's

          ‚Äì a homegrown, Patreon-funded service for sharing
          mixes/mashups. On a smaller scale, the sky is the limit for

          Compared to these, most of Clubhouse's communities seem bleak

        I have more than my fair share of stories and peeves about
        dating apps. On several occasions, for instance, I have
        corrected those who cite Tinder as the origin of the directional
        swiping interface, explaining that it was actually the
        now-defunct service Hot or Not who did so some 15 years ago.
        (Why on Earth I am compelled to do so, nobody knows. Not even
        God.) Somehow, though, I think most of us can agree that Tinder
        is the <emphasis>least shitty</emphasis> of the explicitly
        hookup-ish spectrum of the genre. Or at least, I thought so,
        until I happened to spy the ‚ÄúPhoto Tip‚Äù embedded above beneath a
        preview of my profile on the iOS app.
      </para>
      <para>
        The innocuousness of this advice, which surely would not be
        dispensed in <emphasis>any</emphasis> other context without
        immediately screaming malice, has been on my mind ever since. It
        is not the devil who tells you to make sure a passing potential
        match doesn't immediately learn you have children, but the
        Marketing Man. (Yes, they are distinct. I would explicitly
        discourage that particular sort of demonization, mostly because
        it has proven completely ineffective as cultural critique.) I am
        in no position to relevantly explore the topic of Society &amp;
        Sex, generally, other than to insist that most people on Tinder
        <emphasis>in my area</emphasis>, at least, are not looking to
        <emphasis>leverage</emphasis> it <emphasis>for the
        dick</emphasis>. They are looking for dates, and a good many are
        working class single mothers. To be clear, I‚Äôm not trying to
        suggest anyone in this demographic would be ‚Äúfooled‚Äù by such a
        suggestion. Offended, perhaps, and/or activated in such a way
        that would lead to them replacing all of their profile‚Äôs
        pictures with photos of <emphasis>just</emphasis> their
        children. Regardless, this social group defined by a distinct
        lack of free time, if nothing else, represents an antithesis to

        Before I get ahead of myself, though, I must acknowledge that I
        am not the first to invest in Siri as a text-to-speech
        generator. In 2019,
        <link xlink:href="https://twitter.com/atow">Adam Tow</link>
        released an immensely well-considered Siri Shortcut called
        ‚Äú<link xlink:href="https://tow.com/shortcuts/record-text-to-speech/">Record
        Text to Speech</link>,‚Äù which provides an interface for
        recording, editing, and managing text-to-speech audio files with
        Siri‚Äôs original voices. A testament to its robustness: it
        <emphasis>still works</emphasis> perfectly on my handset running
        iOS 15 Dev Beta 6 despite having not been updated since
        <link xlink:href="https://routinehub.co/shortcut/2506/">March of
        last year</link>.

      </para>
      <para>
        I must admit that I found Adam‚Äôs shortcut more of a full
        <emphasis>application</emphasis> than a speedy personal
        automation, with its full interactive UI menu and darn near
        <emphasis>800 actions</emphasis>, so I made my own set of
        shortcuts based on the same idea ‚Äì using iPhone‚Äôs native screen
        recording feature to capture audio of Siri reading aloud ‚Äì and
        varying only by input (manual text input, getting text from a
        file, or simply reading text from the clipboard.) I‚Äôd then send
        the resulting screen recording in its original video format to
        my PC, where I‚Äôd drop it in
        <link xlink:href="https://www.audacityteam.org">Audacity</link>,
        in which I‚Äôd run
        <link xlink:href="https://github.com/extratone/bilge/blob/main/configuration/Audacity/TruncatenAmpMacro.txt">a
        simple macro</link> on the audio that truncates silence and
        amplifies the result so that the loudest point touches the
        rails. Then, I‚Äôd export it, pass it through
        <link xlink:href="https://www.mp3tag.de/en/">Mp3Tag</link> to
        perfect its metadata, and finally push the end-result .mp3 file
        to
        <link xlink:href="https://github.com/extratone/bilge/tree/main/audio/TTS">a

        United States English Voice (for

        Perhaps you‚Äôll agree with me that this process <emphasis>does
        the job</emphasis> in functional/accessibility terms, and does
        so quite well considering how much one would pay to generate the
        same sort of audio file using Google‚Äôs Cloud Platform or IBM‚Äôs
        Watson. Crucially, though, this original voice was not one I
        could listen to at any length. Siri Voices 2 and 3, however, I
        <emphasis>can</emphasis>. From my perspective, this means they
        have crossed a <emphasis role="strong">very significant
        threshold</emphasis> which I find vastly more meaningful than
        just about all of those in the current discourse. Not only can I
        tolerate them‚Ä¶ I genuinely <emphasis>enjoy</emphasis> listening
        to super-long magazine features read aloud by Siri Voice 2,
        especially, and I believe I would regardless of the quite
        serious crush I‚Äôve developed on them.

        Unfortunately, using the methods we‚Äôve discussed so far with the
        new Siri voices is inconvenient, very hit-or-miss, and quite
        buggy. If you scrub ahead toward the last third or so of the
        second audio player in this post (after the post‚Äôs own,) you‚Äôll
        hear Siri Voice 2 start to bug out in very amusing ways. Since
        Apple makes changes to Siri Shortcuts between releases without
        any public documentation, none of them have ever been reliable
        enough to write this guide. (For the past 6+ weeks at least,
        it‚Äôs been too broken to be usable.)
        <emphasis>However</emphasis>, for whatever reason, Apple created
        a dedicated spoken audio generation action for Siri Shortcuts in

      would highly encourage that you try building your own shortcut
      around the <literal>Make Spoken Audio From Text</literal> action,
      even if you've never worked with Shortcuts (or any sort of

        If we were trying to do this using any other available method in
        2021 ‚Äì even the expensive ones ‚Äì our first task would be
        scrubbing our subject text of any special formatting (Word,)
        symbols, embed, hyperlinks, and any other data Siri doesn't
        understand (roman numerals, for example.) As a Windows user
        who's not at all new to free ways to automate accessibility
        improvements to web content, I envy both you and my new self for
        the magic available to us in the form of Safari's abilities to
        parse complex web content. In my experience, there's nothing
        like it (at least nothing available to regular consumers.)

        The screenshot embedded above shows the result of a
        <literal>Quick Look</literal> action inserted just after the
        <literal>Text</literal> action produced by the public version of
        my shortcut when run on our example. There are three immediately
        problematic issues:

            ‚ÄúThe Psalms‚Äù is not my name, though it is what this blog
            currently returns when asked for a byline. In my experience,
            this generally isn't an issue with most mainstream media
            CMSs.

        </listitem>

            The shortcut appears to have failed to retrieve any data for

        If you'll note in the <emphasis>previous</emphasis> embedded
        image comparing my custom version of the shortcut (left) to the
        published version (right,) you'll note that my chosen solution
        is to manually input all metadata before actually starting the
        shortcut. What's not shown is my corresponding manual inputs in
        the <literal>Encode Trimmed Media</literal> action, which
        includes attaching a retrieved image file (in the Working Copy
        action you <emphasis>can</emphasis> see) as album art. For my
        intended use ‚Äì exclusively generating text-to-speech audio of
        Posts on this blog ‚Äì this makes more sense than unnecessarily
        automating metadata retrieval.

        The extraordinary thing about the screenshot, though, is that it
        doesn't contain any of the other crap (as described above) found
        in the original page. (Beforehand, it looked more
        <link xlink:href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/extratone/bilge/main/posts/johnny-tsunami-smart-house-slavery.md">like

        If all you need read aloud is the body text, things become even
        simpler. In the right example above, I've simply deleted the
        <literal>Text</literal> action and replaced it with
        <literal>Get text from [the Safari Web Article's body]</literal>.
        Theoretically, one could omit that action, even, and simply use
        the direct output of <literal>Get Body from Article</literal> as
        input for the <literal>Make spoken audio from text</literal>
        action, but I say keep the extra step unless it becomes an

        Whichever route you traveled, you should have some sort of audio

        you‚Äôll need to upload said audio to some sort of Web Server

        Drive file before Google notices and alters it, and I‚Äôm afraid
        you‚Äôll find just about every other cloud/file sharing service in
        a similarly unreliable situation. If it‚Äôs going to be done at

        No!... It was just me... Alone, in my mother‚Äôs basement, on a

        as I possibly could of the Apple community‚Äôs unbelievably
        unreserved, almost <emphasis>spiritual</emphasis> volume of
        <emphasis role="strong">pure hype</emphasis> from as many

        comparing to Slack</link>, but like an actual madman.)
      </para>
      <para>
        Anyway, said Senior Vice President of Software Engineering (who
        we are encouraged to hold accountable for basically all
        technical changes to iOS) is named Craig, and these are his
        first few sentences:
      </para>
      <blockquote>

          <literal>For many of us, our iPhone has become indispensable. And at the heart of iPhone is iOS. iOS powers the experiences we've come to rely on.

      <para>
        I‚Äôm dwelling on them because they are

        little to nothing coming in iOS 15 is what I would call

        controversial (and now backpedaled) changes to the user
        interface of Safari ‚Äì feels almost maliciously quartered in the
        opposite direction. Most of the changes in the subheadings of
        <emphasis role="strong"><link xlink:href="https://www.apple.com/ios/ios-15-preview/features/">the
        full feature list</link></emphasis> are simply irrelevant in the
        use for all but the dorkiest iOS users, like myself, and I find
        the fact unacceptable, at the very least.

        This is why I would like to try something different, this year,
        and focus on an entirely different audience: my family, as
        representatives of the vast majority of the iPhone‚Äôs
        billion-something demographic (read: customers.) That is to say,
        who Craig <emphasis>should</emphasis> be referring to with the
        phrase ‚Äúmost of us.‚Äù Not because I believe them to be ‚Äúdumb‚Äù or
        ‚Äúend users‚Äù (in the tech bro derogatory sense,) but because they
        are busy, working people who depend on their iPhone as a
        <emphasis>utilitarian</emphasis> device, above all else. They
        don‚Äôt have the time to dive deep into Apple documentation or
        watch the whole WWDC presentation to gain an understanding of
        where to look for new features or (unfortunately) how to turn
        them off. Realistically, they don‚Äôt even have time to read this
        whole Post, though I hope they will (sorry fam.)
      </para>
      <para>
        Regardless of how we feel about it, Apple has made it clear that
        our phones are going to be further and further inundated with
        automated processes in the background. Whether you like it or
        not, your phone is going to be used to help find other users‚Äô
        devices over the Find My network, your travel information is
        going to be used to inform Apple Maps‚Äô live traffic statistics,
        and so on. For the more conservative members of my family,
        related truths about their phones are going to continue to feel
        like we are continuing to give up ‚Äúownership‚Äù of our devices.
        There are definitive alternatives, but they involve giving up a
        whole lot of conveniences. I will do my best to address this a
        bit later on, drawing from much more articulate critics than I.

        What I <emphasis>will</emphasis> dwell on, myself, are the more
        menial, tactile implications of these abstract changes in design
        philosophy. A general theme of my own use/writing about iOS has
        been re-finding or jury-rigging the ‚Äúbuttons‚Äù which are
        gradually being obscured or eliminated entirely in the
        assumption that Apple‚Äôs automation knows better than us users
        when something should happen or change. A great example: using
        <link xlink:href="https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/ac6a4587d5b54abc934631c214d81c0c">a
        simple Siri Shortcut</link> to completely disable Wi-Fi and
        Bluetooth instead of trusting the
        <link xlink:href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208086">unnecessarily
        complex conditions</link> of doing so with the buttons in
        Control Center. I have sought out these ‚Äúhacks‚Äù (as other iOS
        powerusers have rather absurdly called them) for very selfish
        reasons.

        Rounder, still! From the first time you enter your passcode
        immediately after installing iOS 15, you‚Äôll notice that
        Notifications and other elements have had their rounded corners
        <emphasis>further</emphasis> rounded, for some reason. Assuming
        Safari ships with its new look turned on by default, the
        screenshots embedded above show two locations (subject to

        As of this writing, at least two of iOS 15‚Äôs ‚Äúheadlining‚Äù

        As far as ‚Äúmeaningful ways iPhone could help you,‚Äù I see little
        more than glimmers. Focus Modes would be promising were they not
        so complex to set up, and Notification Summaries are (as of this
        moment) a pretty hopeless implementation of a theoretically
        useful concept. Some additional filters in Apple Maps search
        will prove useful so long as the associated metadata has been
        updated for locations <emphasis>other</emphasis> than San
        Francisco (say, mid-Missouri.) Optical Character (text)
        Recognition has been implemented ‚Äúsystem wide‚Äù under the feature
        Apple terms ‚ÄúLive Text,‚Äù and translation has finally been
        extended to the places where it‚Äôs most useful (think: Safari.)
      </para>
      <para>
        In general, though, most of what‚Äôs coming with iOS 15 has little
        real value in the day-to-day experience for most iPhone users. A
        complete inversion of Craig‚Äôs phrase feels significantly more
        accurate: <emphasis>This year, we were inspired to create even
        more superficial ways iPhone could temporarily dazzle tech
        media</emphasis>.

        And now, I‚Äôd like to take you through what I feel are the
        considerations I‚Äôd like my family to know ‚Äì namely my
        70-year-old mother, who depends 100% on her iPhone and MacBook
        Pro every day to run her private practice ‚Äì but also my ~8

          The single most important/welcome feature addition to iOS 15

            Memories can now be set to your favorite songs from Apple
            Music, and can be customized with color filters. Setting
            different filters will result in different song choices and
            transition effects to nail a wider variety of vibes on
            Memories videos.
          </para>
          <para>
            While watching a video generated by Memories, you can tap
            and hold at any time to freeze a photo so that it doesn‚Äôt
            transition away. The song playing over the video will not
            pause when you do this, but when you let go the remaining
            video transitions and timings will be automatically altered
            to match back up with the song‚Äôs beat.
          </para>
          <para>
            If you don‚Äôt want to go with the song that was chosen
            automatically, you can tap the new Music button to get a
            pop-up interface into Apple Music, allowing you to choose a
            song manually. This interface will include smart suggestions
            for other songs that Apple thinksd you‚Äôll like which would
            also fit the vibe of your video.

          If you're experiencing any sort of D√©j√† vu from the idea of
          auto-generated slideshows with rights-free soundtracks in the
          Photos app, it's because Apple has made several distinct
          attempts to implement very similar iterations of the feature
          throughout iPhone's history, which has involved iMovie on iOS
          and MacOS once or twice. I have fiddled with every one ‚Äì
          including iOS 15's ‚Äì and my (truly sound and original) advice
          is to <emphasis role="strong">avoid spending time trying to
          customize auto-generated videos</emphasis> in general. If you
          explore one of the suggested Memories and find the software's
          default result satisfactory, of course you should save it, but
          be wary of any attempts to take editorial control yourself.

          Perhaps the most unjustifiable background use of your phone‚Äôs
          resources introduced in iOS 15, ‚ÄúVisual Lookup,‚Äù seeks to
          identify ‚Äúpopular art and landmarks around the world, plants
          and flowers out in nature, books, and breeds of pets‚Äù present
          in your photos so that you might‚Ä¶ identify them more
          swiftly(?) The only means of distinguishing photos on which
          Visual Lookup has been applied is to look for the modified ‚ìò
          symbol at the very bottom of your screen in the photo browsing
          view (see the screenshot embedded above.) As you might notice

        <para>
          The decision to target the feature on identifying domesticated
          pets, specifically, is more universalizing than historic

          of my very first written works on tech</link> was/is directly
          related to the subject, though, indulge me for just a moment
          for an attempted explanation. Firstly, I must note that only
          two audio channels (the stereo experiences in various forms
          you‚Äôve certainly had in your life, regardless of who you are)

          destination. Secondly, the actual technology behind Apple‚Äôs
          title was not developed by Apple, but by Dolby. It‚Äôs not that
          Apple doesn‚Äôt acknowledge this thoroughly in
          <link xlink:href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212182">their

        ‚Äúlarger app icons‚Äù also ‚Äúmake them easier to identify,‚Äù

        ...and yet, a playful, exploratory experience is what Apple has
        in mind for Maps, apparently. Here's their description of the

        In the footnotes, it‚Äôs explained that the feature will only be
        available on ‚ÄúiPhone with A12 Bionic or later,‚Äù meaning the
        iPhone X range, basically, which makes sense considering the
        extent of animation and touch manipulation technology present in

        Put another way ‚Äì Apple‚Äôs developmental direction for Apple Maps

        <link xlink:href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/google-earth/id293622097">Google

        It‚Äôs not just the Interactive globe. One of the most exciting
        features in last year‚Äôs release (iOS 14) was the ability for
        Maps users to create custom Guides. I created

        The one commonality in the experience of every single person
        finishing up their iOS 15 review/overview/guide: we‚Äôve all saved
        Safari for the very last minute. I am 99% certain the saga
        surrounding changes to Apple‚Äôs native web browser ‚Äì along with
        my personal, reactionary gripes spewed along the past two months
        of iOS 15‚Äôs Developer Beta cycle ‚Äì were the overwhelmingly
        affirming factors that led to me pursuing this very review. I
        have rewritten this portion over and over again, but now that
        you know how to disable the new look, I‚Äôm going to as briefly as
        possible summarize the changes that are actually relevant to

        Then, we talked for 45 minutes about self-actualization. As I‚Äôve

        wholly a set of expectations which I do not ever again expect to

        For your sake, I've spent the time to break Twitter Blue's
        offering down specifically, feature by feature, only because I
        have yet to see it done methodically in detail from the tech
        media sources you'd normally depend on.

        anything to say about it, really, it‚Äôs suggest this adjustment

        Intentionally or not, the configuration of Twitter for iOS‚Äô
        navigation tabs enabled by Twitter Blue membership is a
        revelation ‚Äì or it would be, were it the only viable Twitter
        client on the platform. It‚Äôs perhaps the most celebratable
        feature included in Twitter Blue, if only because it suggests
        the Twitter team is finally paying attention to Tweetbot. (In

        words writing about just how valuable Tweetbot is,
        <link xlink:href="https://bilge.world/tweetbot-6-ios-review">earlier

        In the clip of the Twitter feedback Space embedded above, my
        second point of note was that the app had not ‚Äúrandomly logged
        me out‚Äù in the seven days I‚Äôd then been subscribed to Twitter
        Blue. To be clear, this was referring to the experience of
        opening the Twitter for iOS app to the welcome screen instead of
        where one left off, which has indeed happened in the interim.
        The worst bit: after logging back in again, all one‚Äôs app
        preferences are reset to their respective defaults. Without a
        means of exporting or ‚Äúbacking up‚Äù one‚Äôs settings ‚Äì like say,

        the process is very specific. On iOS, you‚Äôll need to open an

      <para>
        Long before I was
        <link xlink:href="https://bit.ly/dbfollow">follow-limited</link>
        in 2017, I lived entirely in my [Twitter
        Lists]()<link xlink:href="https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/lists)">https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/lists)</link>,
        the largest of which I built up ‚Äúorganically‚Äù over time, by
        adding appropriate accounts one by one as I came across them.
        Thanks to Tweetbot, my equivalent of the native apps‚Äôs Home
        timeline is a private List of ~200 accounts whose users
        represent the actual entirety of my adult social life, past to
        present. Then, there‚Äôs

        <link xlink:href="https://twitter.com/i/lists/768458273141907456">my

        of Automotive Twitter</link>. I keep Tweetbot in my dock and the
        native app on my device just for notifications, Spaces, and now
        Communities. That‚Äôs it! Yet, using this configuration, I
        <emphasis>never</emphasis> see content that seriously disturbs,
        shames, triggers, or otherwise upsets me beyond reason or
        expectation[^5], but am regularly exposed to a relatively
        diverse palette of perspectives, and just generally find my
        consumption/engagement time on the service meaningfully spent.

        The particular amalgamation of truly half-assed user experience
        features offered in Twitter Blue lend toward a narrative about
        this company which we collectively have continued to fall for
        literally <emphasis>dozens</emphasis> of times ‚Äì often in
        immediate succession ‚Äì throughout the fewer years of its
        history: that it <emphasis>finally</emphasis> has a morsel of
        what <emphasis>might just become</emphasis> a cohesive vision.
        Clearly, I am as susceptible to this as anyone considering how
        quickly I jumped to celebrating the fact that
        <emphasis>finally</emphasis>, Twitter had seen the humongous
        value to be imparted to its userbase by simply adding basic
        configurables like custom navigation and especially refining the
        essential curatorial tool that is Lists.

        Were I still a person who wastes my energy speculating on the
        real happenings within Twitter, Inc, though, an entirely
        different, much more realistic sounding theory arises after the
        analysis we‚Äôve trudged through together in this post: every
        single item on Twitter Blue‚Äôs feature list represents the
        absolute bare minimum resource investment possible. If I had any
        money, I‚Äôd go on to bet that
        <link xlink:href="https://twitter.com/jpeguin">Shihab
        Mehboob</link> could have built from scratch every single
        developmental ‚Äúaddition‚Äù to the iOS app Twitter Blue includes in
        a matter of hours, though from experience, I seriously doubt
        he‚Äôd ever allow such lackluster work to reach even beta tester‚Äôs
        fingers. As far as Ad-Free Articles go, Twitter hasn‚Äôt even
        bothered to swap out all the Scroll branding. The fact that
        <emphasis>I</emphasis> had to surface the concept of Delete and
        Re-Draft to Twitter Employee brains for what all appearances
        indicate was the first time in that ‚ÄúFeedbackFriday‚Äù Twitter
        Space represents a truly sickening lack of effort. No, the story
        that aligns much more succinctly in the grander context is that
        Twitter Blue just happened to be the first disjointed,
        scatterbrained subscription service pitch to finally fall out
        the rectum of this miraculously bunk organization, but all you
        motherfuckers can talk about is Japple Notes Dorsey walking out,
        and <emphasis>what it could mean</emphasis>.

        Since I have now actually been personally and explicitly invited

        I‚Äôll end with some advice addressed directly to Twitter,
        Incorporated:
      </para>
      <para>
        Hey Twitter! If you ever find yourself genuinely interested in
        selling a subscription product long term, as a mutual value
        exchange with your users, make all of Twitter Blue‚Äôs features
        available to all users, and ditch Scroll entirely. Instead of
        placing the bet on local newspapers like <emphasis>The Kansas
        City Star</emphasis>, it should be on <emphasis>you</emphasis>
        to <emphasis role="strong">take the financial risk yourself, and
        offer, simply, a completely ad-free Twitter
        experience</emphasis>. That might just be worth $2.99 a month.
