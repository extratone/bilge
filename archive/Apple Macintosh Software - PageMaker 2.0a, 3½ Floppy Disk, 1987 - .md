### Summary

Aldus PageMaker is page layout software that allows the ready combination of text and graphics in columns for printing.

Aldus PageMaker v. 1.0 was released in 1985; version 2.0a was released in 1987.

PageMaker 1.0 was the first desktop publishing program, and was first released in July 1985, soon after the release of the LaserWriter in March 1985. It was introduced initially for the Apple Macintosh but later also for computers running the Windows operating system.

PageMaker was a key element in the arrival of what came to be known as the desktop publishing revolution, the other key elements being the networkable Macintosh Plus (released January 1986), commonly with an external floppy disk drive, and the Apple LaserWriter with in-built Adobe PostScript page description software.

PageMaker and the personal computer and the LaserWriter printer did in minutes what it once took hours to accomplish with traditional typesetting, layout and pasteup methods. Reports, essays, brochures, newsletters and all manner of other printed works could now be produced on the desktop with combined text and graphics.

The donor taught desktop publishing at RMIT and this disk was one that he used for that purpose.

Part of a representative collection of hardware, software, trade literature and promotional material that documents the history of the Apple company, and its contribution to, and impact on the computer industry and society.
