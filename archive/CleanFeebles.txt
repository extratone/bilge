Feebles in Night
A word arrangement by David Blue
First Edition
To Brent 
whose genuine kindness loyalty and love in friendship surely have no parallel in existence 

When one finds oneself with a warranting quantity of recognizable talent in word arrangement but lacking in the discipline required for a respectable profession I think a collection of this kind is a sort of inevitability Feebles in Night is the aftermath of some five years of wholly irregular nocturnal thought spillage and nostalgic memory fragments but I have made my most valiant attempt to compile it in the definitively optimal manner for reader enjoyment reflection or inspiration You ll note my tendency to play with wordage sometimes violently but such is the privilege allowed me by this medium From my perspective it is perhaps the most essential quality to my works originality It is my sincere hope that some soul derived insight and value will be manifest for yours

Belt driven attic fan 
curious
Hearing punctual freight trains in the heavens already willing it to rub off
Hard at work building
waiting
excepting
the chamber pot inhaling cracking leather on the relic
Schwinn over
Main s embossed crossing past absentee doted bushes over the driveway s entry jagged canyon
two creaking screendoors
leaves leaked pat the mouldsteps
to the twineswing
by the naked bulb s pullchain with the best view of
the forgotten sandbox
where one could excavate
clump d plastic Shermans and creased Army men under the baby powdered bathroom s drain
and remember The Bomb
and smell death
It s not good for it
Always 
Susan
Suzanne at least 
I tried to cycle a gritty cap gun but cowboys bore me
It s just candid cadence so his pacemaker s ok right 
How tiring
Tear a whole day from Kiwanis year Examining up and down 
an auger under load
than Ghandi superior lucidity
Asked politely to soften on the organ
pot luckers absentmindedly exchanged recipes and are ess vee peas 
Granola flakes on colored paper but Slim was always with me from Peoria 
thru front flaring
nibbling on a ham sandwich with a splintry broom entombed by the fireplace under die casts and lanyards and taboos
Bite me Cold
I ll stop at the y lot No isn t always no
Blacksheep from the secret tower rooms since forgotten stage wiring
is infinitely more enchanting than distant cousins water balloons
Mesh umbrella d cheap labor born around her open switches and chandelier moods
I leave my body for the knobbly ceiling note the Lutheran taffy wrapper
in my pocket
Sieve
The swath of energy constant
swivels over chaff and stalk 
alike
I come down from the great pinging creature through the rainbow d pockets of heat
it s already released
I m always thinking about the loyalty of gauges like simple friends or
the starchiest click d acquaintance 
they point as best they can
to the truest truth of the moment
Communication is never tangible but it can be aspired to
through it
you can tame voids or
in haste 
consume the fawn
bedded neath the stalks
or ignore the odor
until the flames lick out the hopper
Tell me
how the brigade goes earnestly chaining
so we ll visit at the bar later
Even hacking up black dust 
I am grateful
for my hours of seeing it through the panoramic window of the county bathysphere
I spin with my feet my right hand outstretched
if I go fast enough I feel the air on the pads of my fingers A cool counter top summoned in any time or orientation I desire If I could eat it It would taste like sherbet It s too bad there wasn t ever any mystery in the marble smoothness of my own little atmospheric disturbance even when I was too little for my hand to make an audible whistle
To My Little Tractor
I heard that you d found a new family recently
and I wondered
how strange it would be for anyone
to do with you the things we did once without knowing my name
I think about the condition
of your fame
as you approach your centennial and what people will say
and what they haven t
I remember the day we met and an old white display covered in ashes
I was military marching
through a muddy field
full of tired old implements
Some had rusted beyond identification others were clinging to the better side
of the line between usefulness and nostalgia
It was so wet 
the ground didn t seem itself
It absorbed my cold rubber boots
They made sucking noises
in tune with their smacking against my calves You sat with your ridiculous face
Your fading orange paint
That big black cylinder with the flush pulley I couldn t stop staring at it
Some bolts were missing
Your wide bus steering wheel that left black grit and an old smell on my hands
I laughed at the placement of your pedals and the deckplating noise they made when depressed
I looked right and left 
and saw your cracked tires peeking above those old gray fenders
like shoulders
in perfect symmetry
The inside of your wheels
attached to orange drum brakes with a mechanical rod
I pushed and pulled your shifter
through old gears
without synchromesh 
and watched the stale boot as it
bent and split its lips forming
some personified embarrassing function Even your cooling fan was orange 
with the belt that drove it
Your throttle looked like an orange thermometer When I pulled it down through the notches 
your fan sounded exactly like the great night fans on the grain bins
They could blow me over and hurt my ears 
I giggled 
bouncing on your seat 
enjoying your beauty in every angle
You were still a snotty little bully among the larger things
seventy years later
Font tires so thin 
they appeared useless
I loved watching them so much I once lied to dad and
said I didn t notice their sodding of the pasture grass as they tilted and turned
You must ve seemed ahead of your time ten years after you were built
A cute accessory to the returning soldier s ten acre paradise
The crowd moved about the field 
following a red striped auctioneer
like old donkeys led
A mass of faded hats with bankrupt seed company logos denim shirts cigarettes and dickies coats
I m guessing they smoked and laughed at crude jokes but honestly 
I never bothered to notice
Though it was a little embarrassing when the mob surrounded us
and the auctioneer used
the word cute
a few times
Oddly enough we did make a pair you and I
A seven year old kid
on a tiny tractor ten times it
We weren t worth much to anyone together or apart
You d seen as much as my grandpa and you expected to sink down
in that mud with dignity 
holding eye contact with the old house as it shed shingles 
both of you giggling at fate
Appear in some old farmer s field of vision every once in a while
In his thoughts 
even less
The picture we made humored
the murder members who d had enough coffee and I grew angry
The red striped auctioneer yelled for someone to start you
I whirred my little hands
to convince your starter wewopwewopwopwewopwop I pulled out your choke You spat black smoke
that smelled of old lubricant remedies
with exclamations on the can The whine of your orange fan as its blades turned
to a sold translucent pancake
I carefully modulated your controls before looking up with pride
But all we d done was stop the smiling I hadn t redeemed you much
I felt like crying
Somebody told me to stop your engine and the bidding began
Nobody was thrilled
The process reeked of obligation
I tried to figure out where your ears were so I could cover them
But then dad raised his hand
and it didn t seem like much of a surprise We d already been matched 
you and I
All the others sensed it too 
and went about their business
of obscuring wisdom
And so we came to be together
dad s attempts to get you on a trailer with a slipping clutch
bore the first time I laughed at him
I laughed again
when we drained your oil
It smelled as if it had soured
and looked like soupy cottage cheese
I laughed at
your darting travel method dad called you squirrely
I m sure whoever made you was
very confused about what you should be not that it ever bothered me
We mowed a lot of grass
I did a lot of sneezing
The heads hit your grill and
I wondered if you were allergic like me Maybe you wanted some antihistamines We didn t always mow straight or fast but we d get the job done
Our pace and reliability equally frustrating for dad
Remember
that evening we mowed the acre patch West
of your shed 
On top of the hill 
we could see the red sun
as it began to hide in the neighbors milo and you crawled through yellow fescue humming in reliable intent
I knew you were observing the moment like I was Maybe you thought 
too
of how we d always be together
Twenty or thirty years from then 
we would live the same scene
Except it would be somewhere a little colder where I wouldn t sneeze
and the three point s discharge
would smell like tea
dad wouldn t be there
to be frustrated with us
I d have my own money for gas to pour under your flying cap
I could drive you to school if I wanted to and
show you to all my friends
We d participate in those stupid parades milling around town 
throwing candy at children looking our best
I m sorry to say now
I have no place to keep you where I m living I d get ticketed if I took you to school
I don t have any friends there anyway 
I have no grass to mow
and I m not much fun anymore
So 
I guess I shouldn t regret
not coming to get you 
or my lack of time spent with you there I know what we had is something
I ll be trying to get back
for a very long time
Be glad you ve aged so slowly
I leave you dotingly
with fondness and well wishes
I hope you dirty another conspirator s hands and that they will become a friend
who will do with you
all the things little boys and little tractors should do
Pain is a disease Pick one tree plant straight beans
breathe steady
squeeze
Leaking
creaking plastic camcorder tape
the noise it makes
red light catch up
it drips up the sidewalk the sky is blue under haphazardly scattered white veins
wrapping around
the entirety of everything 
a little less organized than the ones wiggling toward my hands
they weren t visible then everything has some
bright label on it
the plastic seams
itch my
bug bites when
I slip
wobble wheel wing nut
chlorined urine
on the seat
Everdrear peacing edge between missed streetlamp frontier
treeline plotted arithmetic
On Fear of Death
It s the smallness
of wanton regiment that
reminds one of the ever approaching nothingness
and the proximal moments
stacked ahead to bar their dusk
The sound of the voice that should fill a last hour and the logistical implications of what if have come to weigh upon me as the leaves
turn
as the crawling things go 
and leave me with peace enough to hear such silence and
reflect upon the crowding teeth in my skull
and permanence
Eager on the Milo with his gun hear em waiting for fun for the dust obscuring the dark
passing the lord s time on a VCR
I saved my voice for Revelation on the terrace
Visit
We gave another bushel of apples to the sunroom yesterday waiting for company to show
Windows are walls 
late rectifier in the country
The old house with
comparative vulnerability
but never stagnancy
moving more 
always
enough for the self
to be grape n blueberry speckled
cushion
traveling have to drone clench
ration attention
attempting to contain escape seeking Conserve
tot lorde of constriction

Botany
Live and step lightly young lovers
Live and step lightly old friend
The bounty deceives and the sea is too deep
Seeds newly unevenly recently deposited in the soil black
Walk with your old boots v d 
joined at the back cover them
Searching for value in tiny towns Touching everything Cheaply but I breathe in every whisper of audacity so that I can fill myself up and become something
Summer House
The world is my ashtray dare I seek the sight
of the spider laden sages
or the dour children 
falling
or the new money filled lake and its endless coves of desperate happening
Perpetually breathless accelerating in a fish tank
You re the smell of the dusk heat escaping the city and the sound of fresh wind in my ears
I am learning
Virginia s Place
Browning Locust leaves begin to blanket the little lagoon Tendral stumps ratchet
the bank in place
The ticks have gone away and the corn s tasseling steadily
cozies the world
Overgrown chicken coop rubble surrounds the shed 
sterilized by desolate decades
The spaceship s on the dirt behind the six row
The old Oliver is my favorite friend
Reunion is always occasion and always as I d left it
Headed out sneezing honing noble posture
Black Venice
Observing imagined gondolas on canals through my bluegreen memory
along with my own movements
in reflection 
unnecessary
The rats are real at least
The romance of far off water cities is lost on me 
and the intricacy of companionship is mentioned far too little
when the robin s egg walls berode cigarette smoke and coffee
Rifles on the stoop Nature in the shag
between sleeping and waking the viscerally pleasant scent
of washing denim for working
Give the rain purpose and rut the soil for a season
Broken week of fever d bedsickness
with a drink of the brittled well s tenacity
Riddling with clay turns bounty to impressionably fickle reality
Earth curves away too soon the tilled horizon
and the ill grated gravel upon which so many
have tried to outrun death s Sunday morning apparition
A little of everything every thing little
Happiness is a full tank of gasoline a new pack of cigarettes a roof for your history where it s admirable to
compartmentalize and discipline
one s identity maybe it is 
On Infatuation
Mothers on stilts above an energetic boil
compressing the stream to break the universe as wholly as I can manage to fathom the distance
to mind the gap that is by clarity 
widening
I should ve tried harder to capture the essence of you
but the few notes I knew couldn t contain your ambition
Only you do I allow myself to wonder under everything knee to chin
My song 
though 
is ever growing
as you were absently reminding where to reach
ever further 
still
Escape Velocity
Metronomal
knoll combed clouds approach 
suspending persistent exhaust wretch of absent infecting staying assured dystopic
post ing tick teetering defaulted ritual
martyring
Croaking up flights
muttering downwind their stumbles through life
She believed what was easier to believe
Shy s notice I gave as much as could be allowed in winter s warm our qualm notwithstanding nigh adrenaline s nudge
Emptying the vacuum
Soul Water
Movement
in bitter vibrations about weighted clique
in the sooted pit
Selling whatever
and approaching some place to be saved surreal
or left
or dead
but included
There s a love of
the upset condition
of leaving the bitterness in the bathroom
Fool me 
but it s expensive
seeking and gluttoning the
spirit medicine
The muse of a thousand obstructions frighten amassed
pulled anatomy of cowards to
the drudged rhythm
Open something unwanted for wilting wanters
tonight
Take it
and you ll thank everything give it all away
What is it now 
Instinctual attachment to your beauty means I didn t want to leave the moment I saw you whirling
But you are just a face But maybe you saw me
Savage Grace
Accompany me with your night
to our hideaway from pleasant surprise
Glide me through what trees you give move d about striding cruel stream
I am yours to reflect
and bear with noble assumptions to reciprocally know across our existential divide
to divulge few precious cross corridor smiles
to know with only a rhythmic zest a favorite name
Such designed convergence Such intentful patience My escape in heavy air accepting as last heir
to your
sanctuary of apathy
or so it seems in our newborn night
lit by nearly familiar intermittent tower lights
to reveal a way devoid of purposeless reciprocation
remind me occasionally but not this night
To hum the music and dance in your beautiful retreat with the voice
of a coincidence
of a comfort
of a pinnacle
seen in sunlight one more time over the hedge
by old plotting eyes
that wonder d
in dignified legacy
It was a shame
The voice of my dancer
sustains necessary function to indulge our wary dark dabbling
Too occupied to sound off for warmth in kind that is appropriately distanced
in disgust
without fail 
instinctually instantaneously
Briskly striding through the blackness without complaint
or its language 
paced by ancient intuition
Ye sure footed sage
Ye lethal lunar predator
Killing as serenity obscured by silence s sleepy wool
Stitched and bound by effort s promise
Visible only as correct form to voluntarily carry noble titles
through nostalgic undulations
O little city
of quirk and calm
Whom only I know truly alone
Love yourself and go away
Tenses meander and play through a churning human sea The taxation of diligence for a reserve that could never be objectively respectable nor profane It smooths habitual language to their most dependably honed state
Underbluff
I drove my truck to the valley with a forty
I found a little peace
I found a little respite as had many before me
And it s in such an affection that I lay
And I thanked habitually
In particular nobody
And I remember the family
in a similar state
speaking old words of past lovers that had let themselves go
Perhaps only in that moment I wished them well
Stirred sparrow storm Where are your keenest words Where is your golden drum 
Could there be a man less burdened that I with my unscrupulous song 
Denim Deacon
Barreled playing
reminiscent of original daydreams
but retarded by bigger desires and obligations If you could choose to return to the place where everything could be wanted 
would you 
From the position of some limited fulfillment Risk 
I never arrived at the horizon
but saw of it plenty 
in passing In me 
the need to work it
to handle it
to pull it
to yank it around the yard Even test 
orgiveitago 
at least
Lich of the heading
the shedding behind troughs
and supremely forgotten instruments Child of the least though of places
still a bit insistent upon them upon his own illumination
Regular
By ill luminate
the suspect and spectacle
of a crowd under that duck blanket the one on the couch
the essence of affection is 
in fact 
with the oldest of us
Every distraction falls away eventually
for all of us
Caught always after
in cracks 
slipping
like the futile cup you attempt to hold well water with Respect and fear play together
as they have for ages
as peoples of each Holy book 
respectively
Where are we really living 
and is it in years 
Can it be held
or kept
with enough cash 
do you nullify sacrifice with time 
Leave it on the porch for the sun to fade
On Collateral
We are magnetic fission Elastic wishing
for the tide to come back
Geologically 
I am as unstable as the summer sea
Wisdom I
at odds with mediocrity
I cannot ask you to stabilize me
It takes bravery to kiss a ghost but we have little else pressing
Vivacious blue kicking up dust
making loud crystals Aimless abuse spoiling in gloom Lively living rarely reaching My wildest places all in timing
Southing
The opulent dance
on warming current 
rising
The anomalous pair
through the little city 
haunting
Livid lightning in the gray gloom
erratic stings hovered decorum on my sleepy peace
default equations writ the heart turned machine prosthetic in jest 
hourglass emptying draw of static sans
companionship of loyal light Competent senses 
an ultimate sentence when the clouds have so far descended Relentless
endless Mist of all time misremembered
Yonder tumultuous blanket of suspended gasses will give us a moment of privacy from the eyes of the universe so that we may languish on the deals we ve perpetuated with ourselves
Home
Pedestrian solidity is past
when the grain of the street is swept in my hour
My hour 
when the city s
too cold for the lonely and sure
and the contrast
of the contact
you won t have
owns one
for a moment of serenity amongst splinted trees and resting doors
Flailing through my second Earth
over and over into you
On Serenity
My silence is cosmic
and my peace is the morning
I am the mountain
and its road
I am the unseen envy
of the unseen man
My breath is rare
and my hands are poets
You could imagine the Holy night and its shedding
When all the energy has gone
and the streets are swept 
I am life and death
and home
I was told I m not at peace of all things me not co existing with the sleeping streets every night while you were resting and seeking them in dreams which you chase away
Not at peace with the trenches I cross every day
that I helped dig or the burrowing into the embraceless black like a wandering wraith The bowl of pause I volitiously jumped in
The Other Woman
delicate whisper notes Fragile crystalline jewels in freefalling tumble down to my lips
They hang there
in a minor wail
The surface of the pool rippled into hills
Each crest in time
with the soft balsa hammers striking
my cheeks
Light linen kisses
Night is sanctuary and observatory of Ends
day is just the means to them Tick in arc away the rations and moderate considerations I like big claims because I make them I don t like winding down I prefer to run leap and tumble
River Queen
An allergy to conviction swells in the bleak face of beauty 
cupped in my hands
over the fading red checkered fruitile carpet flooring the hotel lobby
I wonder if I ll be allowed to slip for a moment
and lapse some cognitive energy or if the cultists spy me for a cheap bust of pounding feet
Even so far away 
I recompile while the strange metropolis sleeps curious for the form of conformity manifesting before me
like dwelling in the dreary aftermath
of arranged comically diverse endeavors
The expanse could be barren
or filled with trapped cascading ripples of you Molding the sky to a diaphragm upsetting my poise I d like to play my part thanks
Mint Monk
For me only 
I remember our pilgrimage fondly Our starry Spring sabbatical
With the swayful white lady
and her leather hugs
Evermore we knew for
every silent home sauntered by
Only best friends can impart such generosity wordlessly
A piece of fatherhood mutually
First hand American grace originally
elegant
Artifactual sage of pure indulgences 
lost
Neverboring partner in a time traveling bubble of sometimes contentious rhetoric but inevitably adored by onlooking admirers
Easy over the highways under ancient sky Our chance to ask divine questions
and count upon sureful answers
Cryptobotanical detergent odors stripe the city
Luna has just hidden away 
but I still see Polaris clearly
I m engaged in my shadowgrave cresting mist in duality 
paved
The weary and their cars reviving
idling I 
as them with dew d shoulders silk enclosured
As horizons bezel gradients 
startlers find no more entertainment in the beat
and return with the owls to roost until the city goes back to sleep
There was a different smell that Spring We departed the country but never left
Mutual youthful surreality kisses in the back seat
The Landing
Nodding off with the river nomads 
waking them before twilight with
down come discoursing on Muddy s simmering thrash
Inexplicable stirring opposite outline d bank
as she savagely deepens Intermittently corporeal Bitter ramp postulate Ever tumbling vertigate degenerate
with a fountain pen
and I catch a whiff of past
Twain toddling
academic Mark fetishing
Polishing half desks with shaving cream 
and I give a little tug on the knot that s tethered me
to the quaint little village 
The outpost of lamplight
on a bend of the widening Missouri
Graceful pressure elliptically to my lips
My hand smalled behind you to fit us as if
Over Ozark
Faith
the virus that topples
hourly wages
They ve bandaged the road with black toothpaste
We ve come back dreary doom impending
My skull bounces against the window overtime
Why couldn t his skin to the glass
be given 
They ve reduced wing walking strut hammocking and free loving to bags of
salted peanuts and vomit
You could scoop the gray
from the sky with a fish net
I ll pray for you
My bare feet lose
heat from the passing wet wind
before gaining it back through the light
of Sol
ascending above yonder steeple
My book s pages require a defense from ranks of lonely morning spiders though they decrease from all nighter sleepiness
My thumb rests unintentionally on the transmit button
Our jokes are heard
but not listened to
Methods methods methods glued together 
Communal confrontation
I break too many things that aren t mine I m too often forgiven
The clock on the ashen kitchen wall whistles on the third bird
waves of sound carrying the soap smell It floats 
Purpose driven
Forespring
I welcomed and waited for the freezing icing every winter and relished the panic in the sparse pedestrian s face
Afraid because their brains persistently
strayed to the numbness seeping through their
fleece
and they couldn t calm their scurrying feet
fleeing holiday retreat out of streets
that 
seasonally
treat me royally
So desperately hurriedly
into circling loved ones who d never sink
to reasoned love for anyone
Stooped 
the fireplace dulled me to sleep
I partook in conspiracy arranged my own robbery
I still d holler from my window so they d slip 
bewildered
Less so it steals from them 
Willed to have it taken from me so I d endeavor to make more
When in Luna dly tundral 
I whisper threats to my own being and am lucridly alivened
by its earnestness in crisentual brittling beget lucidity
Leave no room for empathy down my frigid apogee
Hg
Visibility in the city must inevitably improve the Gulf Stream shunned the flakes away
You are the sun
You saw me 
serene
through the branches above the park I scrambly ignored and never missed anchorage
to my rose skies
transcended reservations 
weighted
You are my sun
and now you know why
Heavens I anticipate the day
cleansing summer rain
Smartly
death is defined most accurately I think as the journey to a place from which one can never return If you ve accepted all other processes as reversible you can t fear 
If the Captain s charter slips out of his hands in a careless moment and is destroyed in the sea does he have a destination 
Immediately of course he attempts recovery Though it may be riddled with panic his mind is a habitual machine and it is occupied by grids and coordinates and persistence It is not the custom to question his cohorts follow his orders His vessel s course is altered by his will to retrieve 
It is amidst the sea spray and chaotic shouting that he must pause He must realize eventually that the uncoated stock of his manifest has already committed itself to oblivion in its tendency to absorb He s always known this if not explicitly This is the reason it is kept in the heart of the ship the furthest away from the natural danger of the water 
In this moment the Captain experiences true hopelessness and regret He understands that he has taken his
purpose for granted He is far from weeping but he resents himself 
When he ceases the search he cannot explain To burn fuel in a repetitive grid for this divine note is futile and the expense of livelihoodless resupply weighs upon him as he grasps for the words to order drift 
The purposefulness of his employees has earned them respect and now the Captain cannot demand of them nothingness He orders the engines stopped and he begins to sing the helmsman a sad song 
My Susie 
she comes home to me With a broken heart nightly
I asked of her
a fearless kiss
Her hand her heart Smartly
The bridge crew have never heard this song but the eeriness of their present situation s contrast to the industriousness of their system not ten minutes before has left their Captain and his tune considerably beyond the realm of humor 
My Susie
requires but one fickle fee
lest her raven hair swaddle me Compass for a kiss 
no less
Left to wander
eternally
His voice dies away as he surveys his song s reception with a greedy grin He has anchored his lot completely and stolen their intent from them It took him less than sixty seconds 
I have a game to propose gentlemen His arm enacts a sweep of their chins as if to caress each one We are now the wandering folk and I am the drifting noise You may all jump ship now but I m headed nowhere Full speed ahead Somebody remove ye crewman s head and I ll shower you with all the jewels I have left 
These particular young men are nothing less than contemporary and are therefore quite startled 
I am beauty and lust I am the leader and lost I am your best and my worst I am many things but I am not a fool
to burden 
For a moment the Captain sees in himself a frightening rejection of the sea he loves The grain of the helm disgusts him briefly and he scoffs Internally he sets to burning all but the reason of himself 
I am here because I prefer I prefer life to death I prefer the living to the dead I prefer free breathing to suffocation I prefer my beauty over that which disgusts me The sea does not prefer but it does not disgust me for it has
always been 
I prefer this ship to any other because it is beautiful I
prefer each one of you to the torrent because you understand the exchanges we make with one another That wretched purpose to which I have pursued of late however I hate 
It was fragile and vulnerable It was not of our blood It was so unworthy but so necessary that I have never been more conflicted Because of my actions and their intellectual consequences I hereby order myself executed immediately and I so relinquish command of this vessel 
It took a few minutes of blank stares and an ungodly amount of energy redirected for the sailor s more or less rudimentary contemplation but finally the XO stepped forward He lightly affixed himself to the Captain s arm and led him to the brig where he remained voluntarily for the voyage to home penance 
Naturally the extremity of his outburst would be repeated and exaggerated for generations of sailors It would even be admired for its beauty by one but it was never acknowledged as a coherent manifesto by any and most decent men with healthy minds would give a good riddance to the Captain and his tale and be off smartly 
And so I shall 
Good morninged
