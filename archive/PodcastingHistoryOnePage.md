Apple Podcasts Subscriptions is a global marketplace for listeners to discover premium subscriptions offered by their favorite creators, including The Athletic and NPR. The Midnight Miracle, the groundbreaking new original series hosted by Talib Kweli, Yasiin Bey, and Dave Chappelle, will be available next month with a subscription to the Luminary channel on Apple Podcasts. 

Cupertino, California Apple today unveiled Apple Podcasts Subscriptions, a global marketplace for listeners to discover premium subscriptions offered by their favorite creators alongside millions of free shows on [Apple Podcasts](https://www.apple.com/apple-podcasts/). 

Starting in May, listeners in more than 170 countries and regions can sign up for premium subscriptions that include a variety of benefits curated by creators, such as ad-free listening, access to additional content, and early or exclusive access to new series. Listeners will be able to enjoy premium subscriptions from independent voices and premier studios, including Tenderfoot TV, Pushkin Industries, Radiotopia from PRX, and QCODE, to leading media and entertainment brands, including NPR, the Los Angeles Times, The Athletic, Sony Music Entertainment, and many more. 

“Fifteen years ago, Apple took podcasts mainstream, offering creators a premier, open platform to inform, entertain, and inspire hundreds of millions of listeners around the world,” said Eddy Cue, Apple’s senior vice president of Internet Software and Services. “Today, Apple Podcasts is the best place for listeners to discover and enjoy millions of great shows, and we are proud to lead the next chapter of podcasting with Apple Podcasts Subscriptions. We’re excited to introduce this powerful new platform to creators around the world, and we can’t wait to hear what they make with it.” 

![New channel cards for curated groups of shows.](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/images/product/apple-podcasts/Apple_podcasts-channels-mosaic_042021_big.jpg.large.jpg)

Channels are curated groups of shows. Listeners can discover new shows from their favorite creators through free channels, and subscribe to paid channels as well as freemium channels, which include free shows with additional benefits. 

Also next month, listeners will be able to discover channels, which are groups of shows curated by creators with unique titles, descriptions, and artwork. Just as they can with shows, listeners will be able to browse free channels, which make it easy to find more shows from their favorite creators, as well as paid channels and channels that provide additional benefits for subscribers. 

With iOS 14.5, listeners can access a redesigned Apple Podcasts app featuring an enhanced Search tab that provides quick access to Top Charts and categories. Apple Podcasts also features beautiful new pages for every show and episode to make it easier to follow, listen, and share. The new Smart Play button helps listeners automatically start episodic shows from the latest episode and serialized shows from the beginning of each series. Listeners can also now save individual episodes, which are downloaded for offline playback, making it easy to bookmark podcasts to listen to later from Library. 

The new [Apple Podcasts for Creators](https://podcasters.apple.com) website helps creators learn more about podcasting, stay informed about the latest news and features, and explore in-depth guides with best practices. Starting today, all creators can access an updated [Apple Podcasts Connect](https://podcastsconnect.apple.com/) dashboard, which has new features that make it easier to manage shows on Apple Podcasts, including the ability to edit metadata, schedule and manage show availability, organize shows into channels, manage multiple users and roles, and learn how listeners are engaging with their shows through new performance metrics and visualization tools. From Apple Podcasts Connect, creators can enroll in the new Apple Podcasters Program, which provides access to all the tools needed to build and distribute premium subscriptions on Apple Podcasts.

## **Creators Share Their Enthusiasm for the Next Chapter of Podcasting with Apple Podcasts Subscriptions**

Podcasts have made it possible for creators to share their voices with listeners around the world. Apple Podcasts Subscriptions takes this unique relationship to the next level by offering creators a way to tighten the bond with their most engaged listeners: 

**Martina Abrahams Ilunga, CEO and chief editor of You Had Me at Black:** “As an independent show that started five years ago, we’ve always been powered by our community. And our community is hungry for more! More stories and more episodes — sooner. Apple Podcasts Subscriptions empowers us to deliver that. With our subscription, listeners can hear new seasons and episodes first, before anyone else, while also supporting our growth and sustainability.” 

**Donald Albright, president and co-founder of Tenderfoot TV:** “With TenderfootPlus+, we’re able to provide our listening community with even more of what they want — exclusive, early-access, and ad-free listening for our tentpole titles and new shows. Launching this subscription on Apple Podcasts, where the large majority of our listeners engages with us each week, makes it easy for the Tenderfoot audience to seamlessly upgrade to the best experience.” 

**Alex Mather, founder and CEO of The Athletic:** “Our team loves bringing deeply immersive storytelling to maniacal sports fans around the world, and our listeners tune in to over a million hours of sports news, analysis, and storytelling each week. We know true sports fans are always looking for stories about their clubs and teams told through a new lens, and with Apple Podcasts Subscriptions, we can deliver even more great stories in an all-new way, ad free, directly through Apple Podcasts.” 

Podcasts have also become an important way to understand what’s happening in the world. Listeners turn to podcasts to make sense of major moments in news and culture. With Apple Podcasts Subscriptions, listeners gain a simple and intuitive way to support quality programming from newspapers, magazines, digital publishers, local radio stations, and more, directly from Apple Podcasts: 

**John F. Lansing, president and CEO of NPR:** “Apple has been a valued partner to our podcasting work since it all started back in 2005, and we support their plan to enable a new revenue source for content creators on their platform. Apple Podcasts Subscriptions will provide another opportunity for listeners to support their favorite podcasters at NPR and our Member stations in our mission to create a more informed public.” 

**Chris Argentieri, president and chief operating officer of the Los Angeles Times:** “Subscriptions have always been an important source of support for our business, and podcasting has established itself as a powerful medium for large audiences to engage with our brand of journalism and storytelling. The ability to marry the two with Apple Podcasts Subscriptions will allow us to expand our audio offerings to cover new formats, stories, communities, and more.” 

**Stefan Ottlitz, co-CEO and head of Product for Der Spiegel, one of the top news publishers in Germany:** “Audio is a uniquely powerful medium that provides Der Spiegel an opportunity to deeply engage audiences so they can form a meaningful relationship with our brand. We’re pleased to see this significant investment in podcasting from Apple, which will open doors to new, long-term revenue opportunities that will further empower us to pursue even more ambitious independent audio journalism.” 

With Apple Podcasts Subscriptions, the freedom to develop and enjoy entirely new audio storytelling experiences will redefine podcasting in ways that are surprising and gratifying for creators and listeners alike: 

**Maggie McGuire, CEO of Pinna, an on-demand audio entertainment service for kids:** “Apple Podcasts Subscriptions empowers Pinna to deliver the very best storytelling for kids and their families. Our ad-free subscriptions will feature a collection of award-winning original series, including action adventures, mysteries, comedies, game shows, musicals, and much more. We couldn’t be more excited to connect kids around the globe with their next favorite podcast.” 

**Dennis Kooker, president of Global Digital Business and US Sales at Sony Music Entertainment: **“Apple is putting creators first with their approach to the subscription model. Offering subscriptions provides new flexibility and options for consumers, and is an important addition to helping creators better monetize their works. All of this will lead to more investment and even better shows for podcast fans.” 

**Malcolm Gladwell and Jacob Weisberg, co-founders of Pushkin Industries:** “Podcasting totally changed my approach to storytelling, and Apple Podcasts Subscriptions is a mind shift,” said Gladwell, who also hosts Revisionist History. “Our producers and I have so many ideas that don’t fit into existing models but will now have an outlet. This is a big step forward in the evolution of the audio content business, and we are excited about it.” Added Weisberg, “Podcasting exists, and thrives, today because of Apple. Apple Podcasts Subscriptions will help us connect more deeply with our listeners and build a healthy business. We strongly believe that paid subscriptions are what independent creators like us need to succeed and thrive over the long term, and we’re thrilled that Apple is taking the lead.”

# Apple, Spotify and the New Battle Over Who Wins Podcasting

![](Apple,%20Spotify%20and%20the%20New%20Battle%20Over%20Who%20Wins%20Podcasting/social.jpeg)
The battle for podcast dominance is on.

A pair of announcements this week— [Apple](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/AAPL) Inc.’s [AAPL -0.55%](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/AAPL?mod=chiclets) introduction of [paid podcast subscriptions](https://www.wsj.com/articles/apple-spring-event-expected-to-reveal-latest-ipad-pro-subscription-podcasts-11618911002?mod=article_inline) and [Facebook](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/FB) Inc.’s [FB 1.32%](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/FB?mod=chiclets) new partnership with Spotify Technology SA to spur discovery and listening on the social network’s platforms—are the latest for a rapidly growing medium that is attracting top talent and top dollar.

“With Apple making its move into subscription, there is this platform war emerging,” said Josh Lindgren, head of Creative Artists Agency’s podcast department.

Podcasting, already on a tear before the coronavirus pandemic, exploded in popularity during the lockdown, and is on track to bring in more than $1 billion in revenue this year from advertising in the U.S. for the first time. An estimated 116 million Americans, or 41% of the U.S. population over the age of 12, are now monthly podcast listeners, an 11% increase over 2020, according to Edison Research and Triton Digital.

For years, competition in podcasts has been a lopsided one: Apple—responsible for the namesake of the industry, a portmanteau of “iPod” and “broadcast”—enjoyed its status as the default destination for listening while doing relatively little to enhance offerings or profits. Spotify, meanwhile, has lavished hundreds of millions on popular creators and companies—sparking an arms race among [iHeartMedia](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/IHRT) Inc., [Audacy](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/AUD) Inc. (formerly Entercom), [Sirius XM Holdings](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/SIRI) Inc., and [Amazon.com](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/AMZN) Inc., which all now see [podcasts as vital for keeping customers](https://www.wsj.com/articles/amazon-music-joins-podcasting-fray-11600261201?mod=article_inline) engaged with their services.

Dawn Ostroff, Spotify’s chief content and advertising business officer, said the rush of other bets on podcasting validates the company’s early moves.

“We saw the opportunity before anybody else did, and we’ve been at it significantly longer than anyone else,” she said.

To some observers, Apple’s podcast news this week is akin to the awakening of a sleeping giant. More than 15 years after adding podcasts to its iTunes software, the tech company introduced a way for podcasters on its platform to sell subscriptions. Until now, the company has neither offered paid access for podcasts nor earned a commission from ads that appear in the more than two million shows on its platform. Apple declined to comment.

“Apple, where podcasting originated, cannot lose out on the podcasting battle,” said Daniel Ives, an analyst for Wedbush Securities. “It’s now or never. It’s both a defensive move toward Spotify but also offensive in terms of monetizing.”

Podcasters will pay Apple $19.99 a year to enable subscriptions, and set their own prices for listeners. Apple will take a 30% cut of subscription revenue the first year, and a 15% take thereafter.

“For any industry to be sustainable, we have to be able to generate revenue from more sources,” said Donald Albright, co-founder of Tenderfoot TV, the maker of hit shows including “Up and Vanished,” “To Live and Die in L.A.” and “Atlanta Monster.” Tenderfoot will keep its shows free for now, but will explore releasing exclusive bonus content and early access to subscribers via Apple’s new program, he said. “It creates a more healthy industry.”

Spotify, the big spender on exclusives, talent and technology, has also sought to make the medium more financially viable through advertising and eventually subscription.

Spotify now carries more than 2.2 million podcasts on its service, up from 450,000 in 2019. The Swedish streamer’s podcast listenership in the U.S. is on track to overtake Apple Podcasts’ this year, according to a forecast from research firm eMarketer. Though Apple’s service has grown along with the medium, it has lost market share, falling to 24% in 2021, from 34% in 2018.

Apple’s podcast subscription, which rolls out next month to users, will have company. Spotify plans to announce its own offering next week, according to people familiar with the matter. It will not charge podcasters, nor take a cut from their subscriptions, and will allow them to set their own pricing, one of those people said.

Users of Spotify’s iOS app who subscribe will be routed to a website for the transaction, meaning that Apple won’t take a cut of that revenue, the person said.

Stitcher (acquired by SiriusXM), [Wondery (acquired by Amazon)](https://www.wsj.com/articles/amazon-agrees-to-buy-podcast-startup-wondery-11609360628?mod=article_inline), Patreon and Pocket Casts have offered paid subscriptions with varying success. Luminary, thought to be the most established player in subscriptions, will make its original podcasts available to Apple podcast listeners through the new program. Apple and Spotify, which command many more listeners than those apps, are likely to make paying for podcast content more mainstream.

The broader competition between Apple and Spotify is intensifying. Aside from competing for music subscribers (Spotify is far ahead of any other service, with 155 million globally as of Dec. 31 while Apple last reported 60 million subscribers in June 2019), Spotify has been among the tech company’s most prominent corporate critics, claiming that it uses its strength to compete unfairly, which Apple denies.

Apple’s new podcast subscription option within a revamped app reflects one of Chief Executive Tim Cook’s core strategies, which has focused on building out digital services to fuel growth. That strategy—which generated almost $16 billion in sales in the fourth quarter, a 25% lift from a year before—put Apple in closer competition with companies that operate on its devices. Spotify, among others, has complained that Apple uses its App Store in anticompetitive ways.

[Spotify set off a feeding frenzy](https://www.wsj.com/articles/spotify-is-acquiring-podcasting-company-anchor-signaling-broad-ambitions-11549450887?mod=article_inline) with deals for podcast makers like Gimlet Media and Bill Simmons’ the Ringer, along with its blockbuster $100 million-plus [licensing agreement with Joe Rogan](https://www.wsj.com/articles/spotify-strikes-exclusive-podcast-deal-with-joe-rogan-11589913814?mod=article_inline). It has sewn up other [deals with Michelle and Barack Obama](https://www.wsj.com/articles/barack-and-michelle-obama-strike-podcasting-deal-with-spotify-11559853612?mod=article_inline), Kim Kardashian, and Prince Harry and Meghan Markle, while also investing in studios and services for up-and-coming voices.

“Spotify making these investments has helped increase the market and push up the value of creators’ work,” said CAA’s Mr. Lindgren.

Apple, whose TV studio has released original podcasts including “The Line” and “For All Mankind,” is in talks with podcasters about creating original and exclusive shows for its service, according to people familiar with the matter.

“Even though they have the keys to the kingdom in terms of overall customer base and the App Store and broader content, what’s going to differentiate them is not just aggregation, it’s exclusive content,” said Mr. Ives.

Spotify says it welcomes competition.

“The opportunity in audio is massive. We feel there is room for everybody given the scope and scale of what this medium has become,” said Spotify’s Ms. Ostroff, who added that Spotify is distinct from rivals because of its singular focus on audio. “Other companies are looking at audio as a side business—it’s our core mission.”

Following Apple’s announcement this week that it will offer podcast subscriptions, Spotify is about to do the same. Whereas Apple is asking for 30 percent of podcaster’s sales in the first year, followed by 15 percent thereafter, _The Wall Street Journal_ [reports](https://www.wsj.com/articles/apple-spotify-and-the-new-battle-over-who-wins-podcasting-11619170206?mod=djemalertNEWS) that Spotify won’t take any cut of sales. Apple also charges podcast hosts an an annual upfront fee of $19.99.

It was [first reported](https://www.inputmag.com/culture/before-spotify-apple-owned-the-podcast-market-now-it-wants-it-back-with-a-subscription-service) back in January that Apple was considering the launch of podcast subscriptions. Now that’s happened, and it’s no surprise Spotify intends to respond in kind. What’s going to be interesting is how the company’s differing approaches play out and whether it means either is able to amass a sufficiently potent catalog of original content to damage the other’s long-term prospects. For popular creators, subscriptions give them a new way to make a living. 

_Money opportunity —_ As podcasting has seen massive growth in popularity, Spotify has invested hundreds of millions of dollars ensuring it has a seat at the head of the table. The move could help the company differentiate itself from Apple Music, which largely features the same music catalog but has the advantage of being pre-installed on iOS devices. 

Podcasting could also grow Spotify’s bottom line because it doesn’t have to pay anything for most podcasts, and it can make money [selling programmatic ads](https://www.inputmag.com/tech/spotify-unveils-the-lovechild-of-its-acquisitions-a-full-advertising-suite) against them. Exclusive podcast studios it has bought, like Gimlet Media, could make it relatively cheap to produce attractive content and keep paying subscribers hooked.

![Apple this week announced a redesigned version of its Podcast app along with subscriptions.]()

As more people begin listening to podcasts, Spotify stands to make a lot of money with low overheads, even just from free podcasts. According to eMarketer, advertising revenue from podcasts is expected to exceed $1 billion in the U.S. this year for the first time. But Apple has gone all-in on services for its future revenue growth, so the major surge in popularity of podcasting has finally woken it up from its slumber and Spotify will have to keep up the hustle. 

Apple effectively invented the podcast format a decade ago, but its market share has fallen to 24 percent in 2021, down from 34 percent in 2018. Spotify has more than 155 million subscribers; Apple last reported in 2019 that Apple Music had 60 million. Podcasting is still in its infancy, so Apple could make up ground there. 

_The land grab continues —_ Spotify is partnering with Facebook on a new initiative to recommend podcasts on the social network. Facebook itself has been investing heavily in audio products, including one to rival social audio app Clubhouse. Others including [Reddit](https://www.inputmag.com/tech/reddit-is-the-latest-company-to-clone-clubhouse-with-its-own-audio-chatrooms), and, confusingly [Slack](https://qz.com/1991401/slack-ceo-butterfield-made-no-excuses-for-stealing-clubhouses-idea/), are also creating audio products. Basically, every major tech company is in a land grab to gain market share in listening, where they could make big bucks monetizing people’s time driving to work or completing errands. 

Apple will try and differentiate itself with its focus on privacy, because it doesn’t offer the same user data to advertisers that Spotify does. But will that be enough?

Spotify has been fighting against Apple aggressively in the court of public opinion, [pushing regulators](https://www.inputmag.com/culture/apples-eu-antitrust-investigation-woes-are-ramping-up-app-store-policies) to take punitive action against it, saying that Apple unfairly promotes its own services over those from competitors.

# Podcast Overlords | Liz Pelly
![Podcast Overlords | Liz Pelly](https://thebaffler.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/D.gif)
 

“Your Daily Drive” is a personalized Spotify playlist that updates twice per day, in the morning and evening, with a mix of music and short clips of the news. When I pressed play on a recent morning, the playlist began with a chipper voice actor proclaiming: “Here’s your Daily Drive for Monday! Next, CNN takes a minute to cover today’s headlines!” An advertisement followed, and then a speedy news roundup doubling as an advertisement for CNN itself. Later came the three-minute mini-podcast _Daily Quote_—this episode was a reflection on a Brene Brown quote about “hustling for your worthiness” sandwiched between a commercial for Philadelphia cream cheese and another for an electric toothbrush company, like the audio equivalent of a puffy blog post made to place next to automated advertisements. There were some songs (ones I recently listened to), and then some news and ads. Songs, news, ads, songs, news, ads.

_Daily Quote_ is created by Parcast, a “scripted-entertainment” studio that Spotify purchased in 2019 for $54 million. The buyout was part of a big pivot to podcasts in a spree that also included the production studio Gimlet Media for $189 million and the podcast-creation app Anchor for another $150 million. Spotify later bought _The Ringer_ for nearly $200 million. Of all these acquisitions, Parcast might be the one you could most reasonably think of as a content farm for audio. Its scripts are at least in part written by freelance “content writers” and read by voiceover actors; one recent [job listing](https://www.patreon.com/posts/study-hall-07-14-39315242) solicited freelancers to write scripts for ten cents per word. Their recently unionized staff call working there “[unsustainable](https://twitter.com/joelrcallen/status/1307118722931470337)“ and “[unforgiving](https://twitter.com/ZuluTangoCharly/status/1307007983633592320),” and report not being allowed to [pitch](https://twitter.com/ParcastUnion/status/1306991397241839616) stories. And, of course, this studio’s cheaply made offerings are getting prime placement all over the platform now that they’re owned by Spotify.

Spotify’s podcast push opens new complications for those whose work it circulates. In many ways, though, the $50 billion company is treating podcasters similarly to how it has historically treated musicians, with a system that privileges the already moneyed and powerful. Of course, audio offerings like “Your Daily Drive” and _Daily Quote_ are not breaking news. But a closer look at them helps us to understand Spotify’s strategy as it pushes onward in its quest to control not only music but podcasting too. And that strategy includes: the playlistification of everything, the incentivization of easy-to-digest quick hits, the disguising of advertisements as editorial, personalization to the point of banality, and prioritizing what is optimal for moods and moments. If music has learned anything over the past decade, it’s that the Spotify model is one that only functions at mass scale—and when it’s atomizing and disempowering those whose work creates its value, pushing an aspirational one-size-fits-all approach tailored to pop stars.

Monetizing Your Earholes

Over the past year, Spotify transformed its stated aspirations as a company. It used to see itself as the go-to platform providing “music for every mood and moment”—not just a music streaming service but one that knows your taste better than you know it yourself. That changed in February 2019, when Spotify announced its acquisitions of Gimlet and Anchor in a [letter](https://newsroom.spotify.com/2019-02-06/audio-first/) declaring itself “Audio First,” where CEO Daniel Ek wrote that Spotify’s goals were expanding beyond music in a bid to become “the world’s number one audio platform.” The letter was standard PR fodder, with promises of increased capacities for “discovery, data, and monetization to creators” and “enhancing the Spotify brand.” But in interviews throughout the year, Spotify execs have made different types of claims about what’s also motivated the move into podcasts: advertising profits! Advertising has not historically been responsible for a large percentage of Spotify’s revenue, though the company likes to project about all of the ways it plans to grow this aspect of its business.

“One of the reasons why we got into the podcast business is because we believe there’s a lot of growth opportunity on the podcast side,” alleged Spotify’s chief content officer Dawn Ostroff in [a June interview](https://www.cnbc.com/video/2020/06/25/spotify-chief-content-officer-on-podcast-expansion-growth-and-more.html?__source=iosappshare%7Ccom.apple.UIKit.activity.Message). “And when you think about our monetization data, 90 percent of our monetization is on the subscription side, but 10 percent is on the ad side, and we do think that there’s real growth opportunity for us in the ad space, particularly with podcasts.”

> Playlists are designed to create and condition dedicated fans of Spotify products, not artists or podcasters.

Podcasting does give Spotify a way to push advertisements on its premium users—the ones who are paying for an ad-free experience. Buying a “premium” subscription merely ensures that when you’re listening to music, you won’t be interrupted every few songs by ads. These pages have documented before all of the various ways that Spotify’s branded advertorial playlists and paid-for banner ads make their ways onto the platform. But podcasting offers an even more direct way to push audio ads into users’ ears. Per Spotify’s user agreement: some “content licensed by, provided to, created by or otherwise made available by Spotify (e.g. podcasts) may contain advertising as part of the Content.”

To that end, podcasts are unique in the context of Spotify because “podcasts by nature have the host-read ads that you’re still going to be subjected to on premium,” noted a former Spotify employee, who spoke with _The Baffler_ but wished to remain anonymous—let’s call him John. He says the grand shift to podcasting has been indeed driven by the assumption that it will be more profitable for the company than music has been: “I think part of it is they realized, hey, the music thing isn’t going to make us the money, but we have people’s ears, how else can we monetize their ears?”

“They built the entire product around music, and people who enjoy listening to music,” John continued. “They built their whole product around it, they went public on the heels of music, and now they’re going to make their money off of podcasts, and they’re going to keep the artists screwed.”

At the same time, John largely dismissed the idea that advertising might be a big potential money-maker for Spotify. He explained that, during his time at the company, advertising on Spotify was treated as merely a contractual obligation of the company’s deals with major labels. “The argument would be, they need an ads product, because of the relationship with the labels. And as long as they have a free tier product, they have to run ads.” About 30 percent of advertising revenue would be kept at Spotify, with the rest going to rights holders, meaning it effectively went to the major labels. John and his coworkers would often do “back of the napkin math” to try to estimate if Spotify was making any money off of advertising at all, comparing the vast amount of investment the company poured into its advertising efforts (paying for the people and the tech to build its advertising mechanisms, for one) with the amount of profit it brought. “I’m convinced Spotify loses money on ads,” he said. “It does not add up.”

So it remains to be seen whether Spotify will make a profit off of podcast advertising, or whether it’s a front meant to keep appealing to Wall Street, to keep maintaining the illusion that new audiences and other new revenue sources are on the way. In July, the multi-billion dollar marketing firm Omnicon Media Group did announce a deal with Spotify to spend $20 million on podcast ads, an arrangement that also included “collaboration on research and a first crack at new shows for Omnicom Media Group clients, which include McDonald’s Corp., PepsiCo Inc. and AT&T Inc,” according to the _Wall Street Journal_. But considering how much they are investing in podcast strategy, what are the odds they see a profit? A report earlier this year from the music industry newsletter _Water & Music_, written by another former Spotify employee, Kenny Ning, also debunked the idea that podcast advertising is likely to be profitable. “Frankly, Spotify’s current ad revenue on podcasts today is probably close to $0,” Ning wrote, later adding: “But, hey, the stock price is soaring and growth is up 31 percent year-over-year, so podcasts must be working, right?”

Celebrity Bets

At Spotify, projects that are given a significant amount of company resources and attention are called “bets.” In recent years, some examples of “bets” have included what the company called “Car Thing” (a hardware product for the car that was shelved), “Bend the Curve” (which referred to the company’s need to reduce tech spending), public readiness for the IPO, Ad Studio (the platform’s self-serve advertising hub). But over time, John said, “the bets were podcasts.”

In addition to its hopes that podcasting will bring in new advertisers, Spotify is also banking that it will bring new listeners at a lower cost to the company. To get those new listeners, Spotify has spent a perplexing amount on exclusive deals with big names like Joe Rogan, Kim Kardashian, DC Comics, and the Obamas—not just by buying them outright, like the studios Spotify now owns, but through licensing deals. Spotify wants risk-free, royalty-free ways to grow its numbers. John explains: “Basically what happens with the podcasts is that they don’t have to pay royalties back to a record label . . . their agreement is with the content creator directly, it’s not with a label, it’s not with an archaic royalties system . . . it’s with the podcaster.” In the case of Rogan: “It’s really like a $100 million advertising bet to bring him over and make him exclusive.”

> What does it mean for a company that’s become known for streambait background experiences and prioritizing unchallenging, agreeable sounds to apply that ideology as a deliverer of the news, conversation, commentary, and ideas?

In some cases, as with advertising opportunities for originals and exclusives, Spotify controls the ad monetization completely. Spotify might be able to take the back catalogs of podcasts and blanket them with new ads—also called “dynamic advertising.” For celebrities who have been able to negotiate better deals for themselves, they might still handle and benefit from all of their own advertising—one of many obvious privileges the system affords those who already have mass followings. In every case, though, because of the listening data Spotify collects, they can now sell advertisers on the ability to target listeners of a specific show and charge them a premium for using this data to target those ads. Whether it is effective or not is debatable, but the extent to which Spotify owns the audience has bigger picture implications. John explained: “If they do it like they do music, they won’t compensate the podcaster for providing the fan set, since the argument (on the music side) is it’s Spotify users, and therefore fans on Spotify’s platform, not technically fans of the creator.”

He adds that all of this centralization and consolidation of podcasts is what Spotify is after: “It’s completely antithetical to what podcasts are supposed to be. But that’s why I think they’re doing it.” What are podcasts supposed to be about? “It’s about wide distribution, it’s about monetizing your own content and having control over the monetization, and Spotify is going to try to capture as much of that as they can.”

“Spotify is very curated when it comes to podcasts,” said O.K. Fox, a podcaster and organizer who cohosts the podcast _Art & Labor_, which discusses the “ongoing struggle to survive as an art or cultural worker.” Compared with these big-name podcasters, _Art & Labor_ represents the opposite end of the spectrum: it’s independently produced and self-hosted, advertising-free, and supported entirely through listener subscriptions. It is not on Spotify. “That always rubbed me the wrong way, because what’s neat about podcasts is that through RSS and aggregate feeds, it’s very simple to make a feed and have it pop up in a podcast aggregator, of which there are several very independent ones. It used to be a very open-source type thing . . . I’ve never really cared about being a part of these privatized networks of listeners.”

Nick Quah, a long-time podcasting critic and publisher of the podcasting industry newsletter _Hot Pod_, called small, independent podcasts the “spiritual heart” of the podcasting world on the first episode of his recently launched show _Servant of Pod_. He overviewed podcasting’s history—shifting from early 2000s, when it was defined by “free-flowing openness” to today, where Spotify has spent half a billion dollars buying up studios and locking in deals with celebrities. “It feels like they want to own podcasting, in some form or another,” he said on that episode. “My biggest concern is that if you don’t have a preexisting relationship with a platform . . . If you don’t have a platform yourself, if you’re an up-and-coming nobody from a demographic that’s historically [underserved] by traditional media companies, do you still have a shot? And to what proportion do you have a shot relative to other demographics?”  

Metacommodify Your Mind

The _Daily Quote_ mini-podcast that surfaced in my “Daily Drive” personalized playlist also appears elsewhere on the platform. Episodes appear under the “Lifestyle & Health” tab in Browse, and are often featured on the algorithmic music-and-podcast-clips playlist “Daily Wellness”—a playlist that throughout the spring was featured prominently on Spotify’s “At Home” tab. It’s [described](https://newsroom.spotify.com/2020-04-27/daily-wellness-a-new-mix-of-motivational-podcasts-and-personalized-music/) in a promo video as “your self-care routine, simplified” and features a mix of mostly major label chill music, generic-sounding guided meditations recorded by Spotify Studios, and mini-pods from yoga instructors.

As Daniel Ek explained in a CNBC interview in July, Spotify claims to be capitalizing on the popularity of “wellness” trends during the coronavirus pandemic, and its podcast playlist strategy has followed suit. This particular overblown exchange between Ek and an aggressive sportscaster-ish host of a stock market show is worth picking apart:

> CNBC: A lot of people don’t realize it, but I’m a chill guy! I heard what you said about a lot of people listening to chill music! But it is true. There is a mindfulness wave that is somehow being captured by the people who work at home. Are you able to detect that from artificial intelligence? Because that’s not exactly what I thought would happen during this period!

> Daniel Ek: Yeah, you’re very much right Jim. Our personalization is discovering changes in consumer behavior almost overnight. And we are seeing a lot of people turning into wellness and health—want to destress, want to focus on health. Those are strong drivers, both in podcasts, and certainly when it comes to podcast creators, those that are doing the best are the ones that are tuning into those trends, either on news or focusing on wellness and health. Similarly with music, that’s also been a huge driver of our engagement these past few weeks.

This excerpt, like others from Spotify executive appearances on finance shows, says a lot about how Spotify has attempted to sell its brand to Wall Street: the exaggerated discussions of “artificial intelligence,” for example, to shape their image as buzzy and high-tech. Also illuminating is the conflation of “chill” and “wellness.” Within music, the “chill playlist” trend has been seen as possibly fueled by the need to stay productive in an increasingly anxiety-prone culture. But just like “chill” might really be about productivity, here, of course, “wellness” is actually about the destructive force that is “corporate wellness,” about ensuring that workers hold it together in order to keep producing.**  
**

Along with “Daily Wellness” and “Your Daily Drive,” Spotify has rolled out a number of other podcast playlist related announcements in recent months. There’s already additional personalized music-and-podcasts playlists, like “Mixto” (Latin music and podcasts) and “Film & TV Favorites” (interviews with music supervisors). In April, the company announced three flagship playlists that will be localized to different markets: “Best Podcasts of the Week,” “Crime Scene” (a true crime playlist), and “Brain Snacks” (for those who “crave the latest factoids” in under twenty minutes). There’s also stuff like “Mind Massage” (for relaxing) and “Who Run the World?” (for feminist inspiration), plus “Your Daily Podcasts,” a sort of “Discover Weekly” for audio.

> Spotify has presented itself over the years as a neutral force—a “level playing field” for musicians—but when it comes to news, it’s obvious how un-neutral that type of thinking was all along.

“What even is the point of a podcast playlist?” you might be understandably wondering. Within music, any independent musician will tell you about the challenges that the playlist era has created for the vast majority of artists—about the new forms of payola, the corporate influence, and how they’re nearly impossible to get on without industry connections. And since streaming services rule all of their own visual real estate, the services themselves have become powerful gatekeepers.

These playlist dynamics are not unique to Spotify; they exist across the streaming landscape.  Since playlists are designed to boost engagement, they often prioritize the most agreeable of all options. It’s easy to envision how this could play out for podcasts, where stuff that’s easy listening—whether because it’s light and funny, mood boosting, or emotional clickbait—wins out, and media that requires more focused attention, like dense and nuanced politics shows, or knotty conversations taking on difficult topics, are deprioritized. The other way that they boost engagement—personalization—serves to further encode the biases of its editorial decision making, including the prominence of major-label content, and now, big-name stars and studio produced podcasts. At the intersection of these biases: Spotify execs have [noted](https://musically.com/2020/04/29/spotify-radio-streaming-everything-linear-dies/) that podcasts were one of the focuses of Spotify’s renegotiated contract with Warner Music Group earlier this year. Sony Music announced a “strategic investment” into a podcast production house in December 2019.

Spotify envisions that these playlists will be part of how advertisements are sold, and also part of how Spotify packages and sells mood data to marketers. In an April [interview](https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/21/21228384/spotify-podcast-playlist-rollout-update-weekly), Courtney Holt, Global Head of Studios & Video, said the goal for podcast playlist was to get listeners to “build a habit around listening on Spotify.” That’s because, as John, the ex-employee, explains: “They want to captivate as much of your audio listening experience as possible. During the day, they want you to listen to Spotify at work on your headphones. You go home, you might listen to Spotify while you’re making dinner. You might listen to Spotify before you go to bed. It’s on in your bedroom.” In other words, they want to track your every move.

More significantly, though, is how playlists are designed to create and condition dedicated fans of Spotify products, not artists or podcasters. “Official playlists” ultimately send a message to users: leave your listening choices to the experts! In _Selling Digital Music, Formatting Culture_, Jeremy Wade Morris describes playlists as “metacommodities”: “commodities that rewrap individual commodities into a bundle under the assumption that the new whole is greater than the sum of its old parts and that another new whole is only a recombination away.”

When Spotify encourages listeners to create a “habit” around coming to its platform for its _playlists_ instead of for specific artists or podcasters, it does a few things. One, it diminishes the relationships that listeners have with what they’re listening to—watering down the experience of being a music fan, or now a podcast fan, because they’re listening to lots of different media but not forging deep relationships with specific artists and shows. It also strips agency and power from the people who make the work that sustains the platform: if users are coming to the platform for a playlist instead of a specific artist or podcaster, whether or not Spotify is able to retain those artists or podcasters on its platform matters very little to their bottom line. If they screw over the independent food podcasters and they all decide to leave the platform, what difference does that make to the listener who is just used to hitting play on the “Chill Dinner Time Talk” podcast playlist and won’t know the difference anyway? Spotify will find another podcaster to add to a playlist, or even better, get some new stuff going in Spotify Studios.

Streambait Pods

Within music, streambait has already taken a variety of polarizing forms. On one hand, there’s the lean-back background sounds so easy on the ears that listeners don’t think to turn them off.  On the other, there are trends that prioritize what’s hard-and-fast and attention-grabbing. Spotify’s podcast efforts reflect both examples. 

The playlistification of podcasts is already proving to have influence on the types of podcasts Spotify recommends, similarly to how mood and moment playlists have dictated what types of songs rise to the top. Spotify has tightened its control over what wins and loses, and over time it has spawned various waves of music manufactured with specific playlists in mind, resulting in something more like platform culture than music culture. Within podcasting, playlists like “Your Daily Drive” and “Daily Wellness” are already suggesting that over time streaming platforms could come to affect the creative process of podcasting by way of what is preferable in its flagship playlists: shorter podcasts, or those with chilled-out undertones, or ones that otherwise play into listener vulnerabilities. 

> Will Spotify take a page from Facebook’ tired refrain: We’Re JuSt a pLaTfOrM?

Streambait shifts within podcasting aren’t solely a result of playlisting though, and some have already been well documented. Quah, the _Hot Pod_ publisher, was quoted in a 2018 _New York Times_ piece about Parcast—one the podcast studios Spotify bought in 2019, which is known for its sensationalized scripted crime stories—saying he wished podcasting “could move past BLARING DEATH AND TRAGEDY as an overt creative strategy,” a reminder of the all-caps clickbait tendencies embedded in that company’s take on crime stories. And Cherie Hu, a music industry reporter and the publisher of _Water & Music,_ has [written](https://hotpodnews.com/will-podcast-playlists-elevate-the-microcast/) in _Hot Pod_ about how Spotify is already making podcasts shorter, explaining how the “podcast playlist format in particular will likely institutionalize the ‘microcast’ . . . as a mainstream entertainment format, not to mention a production requirement for studios.”

Another streambait trend that’s already been adopted into Spotify podcasting: podcasts hosted by influencers and viral stars—it’s similar to how the streaming era has seen the music industry trying to turn TikTok teens into pop singers. For example, earlier this year Spotify unveiled an original podcast hosted by a nineteen-year-old TikTok star named Addison Rae, who is part of the TikTok influencer “content house” The Hype House. (When she signed with WME in January, the deal included podcasting.) Both the Kim Kardashian podcast and the Addison Rae podcast are branded as offerings of Parcast. The dollar amounts of their deals haven’t been reported.

Many questions arise as Spotify pursues such podcasting endeavors manufactured to grow its subscriber base and user data troves at cheaper rates. A glaring one: What does it mean for a company that’s become known for streambait background experiences and prioritizing unchallenging, agreeable sounds to apply that ideology as a deliverer of the news, conversation, commentary, and ideas? It’s one thing to make chill workout playlists—enormously consequential within music—but it is another entirely to get the news from a company that makes chill workout playlists, as it attempts to do with “Your Daily Drive.”

Spotify has presented itself over the years as a neutral force—a “level playing field” for musicians—but when it comes to news, it’s obvious how un-neutral that type of thinking was all along. Because what you get is political centrism, evident in how “Your Daily Drive” most often surfaces clips from the likes of CNN and NPR. To promote unchallenging ideas is not a neutral stance—it’s a choice.

“Without having a better, more democratized media sphere, that’s the type of shit that rises to the top,” said Fox, the _Art & Labor _podcast cohost. “It just feels like neoliberalism working the way it’s supposed to when these big billionaire companies play safe with each other. This is the unchallenged, mainstream discourse. This is what is safe to promote—and it’s true because that type of media doesn’t actually challenge anything. It certainly doesn’t challenge itself. It doesn’t challenge the politicians, it doesn’t challenge Joe Biden, it’s why we have Joe Biden. Because of the complete pandering of these outlets towards the neoliberal status quo.” 

Other questions are looming: Is Spotify prepared for what comes with being a media company? Is the company prepared to deal with disinformation and hateful ideas? Think about how algorithmic political suggestion has led people to dangerous ideologies on YouTube: Does Spotify have breaks in place to prevent that? What if Trump, or a far-right outlet, wanted to launch a podcast on Spotify? Will Spotify take accountability for what its users publish, or will it take a page from Facebook’ tired refrain: _We’Re JuSt a pLaTfOrM?_

The answers seem obvious, given what has surfaced about ongoing internal conflicts at Spotify regarding _The Joe Rogan Experience_ podcast. This fall, a group of Spotify staff reportedly made demands that the company take responsibility for its content. The group threatened to strike if the company failed to maintain editorial oversight of the show; the demands included content flags, trigger warnings, fact-checking, and corrections, as well as the removal of an episode featuring a particularly hateful and transphobic conversation. In response, Daniel Ek has [reportedly](https://www.vice.com/en/article/xg8jq4/spotify-joe-rogan-transphobic) continued to defend keeping the episode online, and urged staff to not talk to the media.

Also worth remembering will be the company’s documented history of penalizing its critics, or at least making a situation where musicians live in fear of retaliation. This has been documented by musicians and music journalists. In 2018, _Guardian_ music editor Laura Snapes reflected on this, writing: “If I compiled the off-record remarks from my interviews over the past decade, the majority would concern Spotify—namely how much artists hate it. ‘Please don’t put that in,’ they panic after slagging it off. ‘I really need it to support my new album.’” Will the podcast overlords punish critical podcasters and news outlets similarly?

Musician-Podcaster Solidarity

There are clear similarities between Spotify’s treatment of music and podcasts, but there _are_ unique challenges that exist for podcasters on Spotify—even the ones whose work is owned entirely by the company. For example, when Gimlet employees announced they were unionizing in 2019, their announcement included that they are working towards a contract that includes “equitable processes for protecting employees’ intellectual property” among many other goals. As is being demonstrated already, not all podcasts owned by the company are treated equally.  

Earlier in 2020, the hosts of Gimlet-owned podcast _The Nod_ made headlines when they revealed some of the challenges that they’ve come up against since Spotify has become the owner of Gimlet, and as a result, the owner of their podcast. This means Spotify owns their RSS feed going back to 2017, which is a big deal for podcasters. Though the hosts of the _The Nod_ were able to strike an agreement with Spotify giving them access to their own feed, as they’ve pointed out, the fact that they need to ask for such permission is a sign of the power imbalance at play. When a company owns a podcaster’s RSS feed, they essentially own the audience, and have the power to lock the podcaster out of it. Feed ownership equals ears and attention that can be monetized through ads and promotions.

> The real streaming power struggle can’t simply be boiled down to artist versus artist, or musicians versus podcasters, despite what those at the top would prefer.

But it’s not just about the RSS feed. As reported in depth by _The Verge_ in June, in some situations, Spotify also owns all of the podcast’s intellectual property—even its name. “Networks and publishers like @Gimletmedia / @SpotifyUSA and @BuzzFeed want to own ALL of a show’s IP from the jump,” wrote _The Nod_’s [Brittany Luse](https://twitter.com/bmluse/status/1273739865155346439) on Twitter. That means that anytime the hosts want to do anything with their podcast name, they need Spotify’s approval: books, merch, events. The podcasters thus far who have had the power to forge deals without handing over full ownership have included celebrities like Rogan and Kardashian.

“If your platform isn’t big enough to push back on that, tough luck,” Luse wrote. “Ours wasn’t . . . This is the industry model. Frankly, it’s a big reason why many podcast company staff pages and show rosters look as white as they do. Things often work as they are designed to.”

It raises a crucial point: as much as Daniel Ek wants to continue doing interviews pushing the same talking points about the democratizing force that streaming has been, it ultimately just reproduces and exacerbates the exploitative status quo, where those without the numbers are treated as disposable. The fact that podcasting staff are unionizing is of particular importance in this regard. Solidarity amongst podcasters and musicians could be useful in imagining new systems and practices that work for everyone. 

Musicians are often said to be like the “canaries in the coalmine” when it comes to media trends, so podcasters should take heed that so many have been struggling in this model. Spotify knows this. When the company announced its “Audio First” mission in 2019, it was laced with a peculiar tone—it read as if Spotify were prematurely trying to calm down angry musicians, who would obviously be in uproar that podcasters were about to show up and steal people’s ears on the platform, detracting attention and streams and their precious penny fractions. But in attempting to debunk such an idea, the company further pushed its simplistic rendering of how power circulates on its platform. The real streaming power struggle can’t simply be boiled down to artist versus artist, or musicians versus podcasters, despite what those at the top would prefer. It’s instead defined by how money influences those pulling the levers—within Spotify, yes, but also within the music, streaming, and media industries at large. It would serve the billionaire streaming overlords well if musicians and podcasters did not see their struggles as interconnected, but as workers who are being exploited for corporate profit, they should see it this way.  Despite the characterization of that letter, working podcasters and musicians are clearly not enemies. Perhaps they are starting to have some common ones, though.

About a decade ago, Hank and John Green, fraternal YouTube stars, founded VidCon, an annual convention in Anaheim, Calif., that celebrates online video auteurs and their screaming teenage fans. As YouTube’s cultural impact deepened, so did VidCon’s. A constellation of amateur creators grew into an industry, with [VidCon](http://vidcon.com/) providing a stage for them to promote themselves IRL. Walt Disney Co. and DreamWorks Animation LLC bought up pieces of the YouTube ecosystem, confident they could transform fandom into fortune.

As VidCon matured, the Greens noticed a stir of creative energy in another corner of the web. The audience for their comedy podcast, [ _Dear Hank & John_](https://www.wnycstudios.org/shows/dear-hank-john), in which they offer listeners questionable advice, was growing faster than that for their chatty web videos. So they decided to create a VidCon equivalent. In December 2017 the Greens and a few collaborators threw the first PodCon. Months later they sold VidCon to Viacom Inc. for an undisclosed sum.

[PodCon](https://www.podcon.com/) reconvened at a Seattle conference center in January with more than 3,000 people in attendance. Some wore T-shirts with podcast logos, while others dressed as their favorite podcast characters. In between panels they swapped practical advice, like how to make sound effects (rocking the legs of an old wooden table mimics a creaking ship) or how to avoid an echo (record under a blanket). People scribbled podcast recommendations on a wall and took selfies with stars. In a dimly lit auditorium, a few hundred people watched [Griffin McElroy](https://www.griffinmcelroy.com/) edit his family’s podcast—another comedic “advicecast” called _My Brother, My Brother and Me_—as his keystrokes were magnified on a Jumbotron.

Anyone who lived through the early days of the online video boom, when investment and hype outpaced profit, may have experienced some déjà vu—the same sense of exhilaration, the same thin financial rewards. “People are starting to realize it’s not super easy to make money in this world,” Hank Green says.

Even so, Hollywood and Silicon Valley are once again lining up to give it a try. Shortly after PodCon, [Spotify Technology SA](/quote/SPOT:US), owner of the world’s most popular paid music streaming service, [ made the largest deal yet in the space](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-02-06/spotify-rises-on-podcast-acquisitions-robust-subscriber-growth). In a filing it said it had paid $340 million for podcast company Gimlet Media Inc. and Anchor FM Inc., an app and web tool that helps podcasters record and distribute their work. (It was [widely reported](https://www.recode.net/2019/2/1/18207198/spotify-gimlet-podcast-acquisition) that it spent [$230 million on Gimlet](https://hotpodnews.com/spotify-in-advanced-talks-to-acquire-gimlet/) and $110 million on Anchor.) By investing in the medium, Spotify becomes less reliant on music, which requires paying royalties to labels.

The company plans to spend as much as $500 million on podcast deals this year, a big bet that profits will eventually match enthusiasm. “Audio is only one-tenth of the size of the video market,” Chief Executive Officer Daniel Ek said on a February earnings call. “There is a massive opportunity here for audio to evolve into a more personalized, more immersive experience, much like how the video industry has evolved.”

There are more than 600,000 podcasts in [Apple Inc.](/quote/AAPL:US)’s service, about double the number from three years ago. The top ones attract audiences rivaling those of cable-TV shows, but the vast majority reach few listeners and make no money. The median audience for a podcast is about 130 people, according to hosting site Libsyn.

The competition for attention is growing fierce, though. Newer podcasters are paying for studio time, upgrading equipment, and hiring artists to design logos that stand out in Apple’s podcast app. “There’s a much more savvy sensibility among creators,” says Gina Delvac, who produces _Call Your Girlfriend_, in which two friends talk about pop culture and politics. “You have to have that professional gloss to get any amount of attention.”

The most popular offerings are a mix from podcasting companies (Gimlet, Wondery Inc.), individuals (_The Joe Rogan Experience_, _WTF With Marc Maron_), traditional media (the _New York Times_, _Slate_), and radio giants (WNYC, IHeart). NPR is the largest podcaster, with 46 shows reaching more than 19 million U.S. listeners a month. Oprah Winfrey, Conan O’Brien, and Mike Tyson are podcasters.

About 73 million Americans listen to podcasts monthly, up from 42 million in 2014, according to Edison Research. Industry revenue, though minuscule compared with that of radio, TV, movies, or books, almost doubled from 2016 to 2017, to $313 million. (For context, that’s about how much revenue BuzzFeed Inc. alone generated in 2018.) That figure is expected to double again by 2020, [according to the Interactive Advertising Bureau and PwC](https://www.iab.com/insights/the-second-annual-podcast-revenue-study-by-iab-and-pwc-an-analysis-of-the-largest-players-in-the-podcasting-industry/). Several top podcasts make more than $1 million a year. Last year _The Daily_, from the _New York Times_, cleared more than $10 million in advertising.

There are several lines of thinking about how to close the enthusiasm-revenue gap. One focuses on the programming logjam, which can make choosing something to listen to a frustrating experience. Several startup websites and apps, including Piqd, Listen Notes, and Podchaser, are trying to match listeners with lesser-known shows. Larger platforms such as Spotify and internet-radio giant Pandora Media Inc., which honed this functionality in music, are now applying it to podcasts.

The industry is also striving to broaden the market. Some fear that podcasting has become a community talking to itself—a coastal thing, like electric scooters and avocado toast, which may soon reach saturation. “It’s less exciting when it’s the sixth football podcast or the third comedian with a podcast talking to his L.A. comedy buddies,” says [Amanda McLoughlin](http://amandamcloughlin.com/), co-host of _Spirits_, which describes itself as “a boozy dive into mythology, folklore, and urban legends.”

Courting the millions of Americans who’ve heard of podcasts but don’t listen will mean diversifying their subject matter. After the success of _Serial_, produced by _This American Life _in 2014, which began with an investigation of an old murder case in Baltimore, true-crime podcasts became as ubiquitous as TV police procedurals. While the genre is popular, the macabre material can be off-putting to many potential listeners. Tom Webster, a senior vice president at Edison Research, [wrote in an August essay posted on ](https://medium.com/s/story/podcastings-next-frontier-a-manifesto-for-growth-7e8b88d32fde)_[Medium](https://medium.com/s/story/podcastings-next-frontier-a-manifesto-for-growth-7e8b88d32fde) _that the industry has to get out of its bubbles “and understand the real bottle­necks to the growth of podcasting.”

These bubbles are demographic inefficiencies that traditional media—which has spent decades designing TV series, magazines, and radio shows to amass niche audiences—should be well-suited to address. Everyone from radio syndication heavyweights such as Westwood One LLC (_The Mark Levin Show_, _American Country Countdown_) to supermarket publishers like American Media Inc. (_Us Weekly_, _Soap Opera Digest_) have rolled out podcast ventures.

We'll help you find a great rate. Even if it's not with us.

The advertising model will have to evolve, too. Early on there was no easy way to insert an ad break into a podcast. Creators haggled for deals directly with sponsors and read commercials themselves. When Marc Maron started _WTF_ in 2009, his first advertiser was Just Coffee Cooperative; his declaration that the brew is so strong “I just shit my pants” soon became a catchphrase. (While the canned ads are a popular vestige of podcasting’s early days, they’re perhaps less palatable to big advertisers accustomed to mass-produced spots.)

Companies such as Panoply Media LLC sell software to automate the advertising process and target listeners, while businesses such as Stitcher act like traditional media-­buying agencies, connecting hosts with brands hoping to reach a particular demographic. Owned by media conglomerate E.W. Scripps Co., Stitcher sells ads for more than 250 shows and pays out millions to podcasters each year. Ad brokers sell commercials for $25 to $50 per 1,000 downloads (an episode usually has two or three breaks). The money adds up—a top show like _Freakonomics Radio_ averages more than 1.5 million downloads per episode.

Larger advertisers haven’t fully embraced the medium, but they’re interested. [Procter & Gamble Co.](/quote/PG:US), maker of Crest toothpaste and Oral-B toothbrushes, recently spent some of its world-leading ad budget on _Chompers_,_ _a series produced by Gimlet. Kids can ask Amazon’s Alexa to play the two-­minute episodes and take trivia quizzes while brushing their teeth. _Chompers_ is also available as a twice-daily podcast you can download on any platform.

One of the reasons there aren’t more Procter & Gambles on board is that the medium’s best consumption metric is the inexact one of downloads. Who hasn’t downloaded a podcast and then forgotten about it or immediately deleted it? Apple, the dominant listening platform, has its app on every iPhone, but it doesn’t share as much data as it could, making it hard for a podcaster to access major ad budgets.

Many podcasters supplement ad revenue with live tours. The night before PodCon, _Welcome to Night Vale_, a popular podcast about a fictional desert community where bizarre things happen, performed at the Neptune Theatre in Seattle. Tickets were $30. The sales for the two sold-out shows at the 800-person auditorium amounted to roughly $50,000. Over the next several weeks, _Night Vale_ did more than 20 shows from Berlin and London to Austin and Phoenix. Co-writer Jeffrey Cranor says the show averages about 400,000 downloads an episode, but it makes more money from touring and finds it a more reliable business. “Advertisers are fickle,” he says.

Several companies are betting that fans will pay subscription fees for exclusive content. For $4.99 a month, the Stitcher Premium app offers subscribers exclusive podcasts, including a fictional show about the character Wolverine, which is co-produced with Marvel. Luminary will also offer exclusivity when it starts later this year. In 2018, Spotify paid ­comedian Amy Schumer more than $1 million for the rights to her podcast, _3 Girls, 1 Keith_, which will become part of the content buffet available to paying Spotify customers; during the quarter ended Dec. 31, it offered subscribers 14 other exclusive shows. For now, most Gimlet podcasts are universally available, but in the future more may be placed behind Spotify’s paywall.

Gimlet sees Hollywood as another income source; Matt Lieber, who co-founded the company with Alex Blumberg, says it wants to be “the HBO of audio.” The five-year-old business, which produces 24 podcasts, has a staff of 120 in a Brooklyn office designed by the architect who created studios for Jimi Hendrix and the Boston Symphony Orchestra. The company recently scored a hit with _Homecoming_, a psychological thriller [Amazon.com Inc.](/quote/AMZN:US) adapted for TV starring Julia Roberts. An episode of Gimlet’s most popular podcast, _Reply All_, which mines internet culture, is being made into a movie. Directed by Richard Linklater and starring Robert Downey Jr., the film is about a con artist and an editor who tries to expose him.

Lieber says Gimlet wants to be both the Marvel and Bloomsbury of audio, with storytellers cooking up the superheroes and villains of Hollywood’s future. “It’s just as likely that the next Michael Crichton or J.K. Rowling will be a podcaster,” he says.

Oren Rosenbaum is an agent with United Talent Agency, which has about 50 podcast-focused clients, including Ira Glass; Guy Raz, a co-host of several NPR podcasts; and Karen Kilgariff and Georgia Hardstark, co-hosts of _My Favorite Murder_. “We’re thinking about the economic deal terms,” Rosenbaum says, declining to elaborate on them. “How much can we get guaranteed? What are the revenue shares we can expect?”

About 50 percent to 70 percent of all podcast listening is done via the Apple podcast app and iTunes. Getting featured in the New & Noteworthy section can bring a new entrant a horde of listeners. Yet despite its centrality to the industry, the roughly $800 billion company hasn’t devoted many resources to it. For years a single employee, Steve Wilson, was the contact for anyone seeking promotion.

Others sense opportunity. In addition to Spotify, there’s [Google](/quote/GOOGL:US), which last summer started a podcast app for Android users and has begun including podcasts in search results. Last fall, Pandora introduced the Podcast Genome Project, which uses an algorithm to make recommendations. Recently, Audible, Amazon’s audiobook company, has made forays into podcasting.

If Apple wants to hold its position, it might take a page from YouTube’s playbook. In the early days of online video, it was laissez-faire toward the creative community. Over time, however, as Facebook and Amazon’s Twitch tried to lure away creatives, YouTube embraced the culture. It signed deals with high-profile YouTubers and built lavish studios where producers got free resources to improve their craft. Spotify’s purchase of Gimlet signals that a similar fight for the podcast community is taking shape. “For publishers, it’s about who do you play with now,” says Nick Quah, who writes the industry newsletter _Hot Pod_.

If online video offers ideas for nurturing a scene, it also presents warnings. Boosters used to make big predictions about video, too: Monetization would catch up with fan enthusiasm, Hollywood money would flow in, paying subscriptions would skyrocket. A half-decade later, the business model is still in flux. At the peak of the frenzy in 2014, Disney bought Maker Studios, which created and aggregated short-form videos, ultimately paying $675 million for it. For a moment, Maker was key to Disney’s future. Then it wasn’t. By 2017 it was laying off large portions of its staff. Podcasting has already faced similar doses of reality. Last year, a few dozen employees involved in podcasts left Audible, Buzzfeed, and Panoply through layoffs or restructuring.

Much will depend on Apple. The company declined to comment for this article, but there are hints that it’s being more proactive. Last year some of its employees flew to Los Angeles to meet with “Dr. Phil” McGraw, the celebrity psychologist, who’d decided to start a podcast. McGraw says the reps gave him a crash course in the basics. They told him to keep each episode to about 45 minutes so fans could listen to half on their way to work and half on their way home. They told him the importance of a good microphone and a quiet room. “They give you an awful lot of information you just wouldn’t know otherwise,” McGraw says.

On a recent episode of his TV show, he explained to viewers how they could listen to his podcast, _Phil in the Blanks_, in which he interviews celebrities. A screen behind him displayed a giant iPhone. “On your phone or iPad, you click on this purple icon,” he said. “It has the word ‘podcast’ under it.”

McGraw says he plans to do a true-crime podcast next.

Online radio is booming thanks to iPods, cheap audio software and weblogs, reports Ben Hammersley

Wed 11 Feb 2004 21.50 EST

With the benefit of hindsight, it all seems quite obvious. MP3 players, like Apple's iPod, in many pockets, audio production software cheap or free, and weblogging an established part of the internet; all the ingredients are there for a new boom in amateur radio. 

But what to call it? Audioblogging? Podcasting? GuerillaMedia? 

"It's an experiment, really," says Christopher Lydon, the ex-New York Times and National Public Radio journalist, and now a pioneer in the field. "Everything is inexpensive. The tools are available. Everyone has been saying anyone can be a publisher, anyone can be a broadcaster," he says, "Let's see if that works." 

Lydon's programmes, downloadable from his weblog, are interviews with webloggers, internet pioneers, and more recently, politicians, as the American presidential election campaigns gain speed. 

When I spoke to him, Lydon was in Iowa, reporting for his website from the caucus. With no publisher to appease, no editor to report to, and an abundance of cheap tools, he says he feels unleashed to work directly with his audience. 

This, he says, is "something that newspapers can only dream about... they all have an institutional envy (of this)". 

By combining the intimacy of voice, the interactivity of a weblog, and the convenience and portability of an MP3 download, Lydon's work seems to take the best of all worlds, and not just for the listener. The ability to broadcast out, and have the internet talk back to them, Lydon says, is very appealing to journalists: professional hack and weblogger alike. 

"It's an approach to a different kind of radio. My feeling is that traditional media in America is stuck. Let's think of a new kind of media," he says. 

He's not alone in this view. Many people are seeing the "internet as a medium that can garner a great deal of feedback," says Jonathan Korzen, director of public relations for Audible.com. Audible is an American company which started off selling downloadable audio books, but now, Korzen says, its fastest growing market isn't books, but downloadable radio programmes. 

They sell subscriptions to recordings of many popular daily American national talk radio shows, and even to read-aloud versions of the New York Times and Wall Street Journal. The freedom given to the listener, of being able to choose when and where to listen to their favourite programming is proving extremely popular. 

Add that to the feedback fostered by the increasingly online-savvy listenership that are searching these things out, and you have a potent mix. 

Liberating the listeners from time and place, and allowing them to talk back to the programme-makers is one thing: liberating the programme-makers is even better. You can get away with a lot more on the internet. 

Case in point: Audible also creates its own programming. Susie Bright, the American sex writer, has a downloadable weekly show, In Bed with Susie Bright, currently on its 145th episode and very popular, despite never having been traditionally broadcast or promoted. "Her show is, in essence, unbroad castable," understates Korzen, "because of her frank language." 

Happily, being distributed via the internet, downloadable radio is not subject to any programming regulations. Nor is there a shortage of airtime, previously a major constraint on aspiring radio journalists. 

"The business involved in getting something on the radio (in the US) is an onerous one," says Korzen, "but the internet is not fettered by regulations." 

Although they currently have no concrete plans, Audible is considering launching a form of "vanity press", perhaps later on this year. This might allow all-comers to sell downloadable radio shows, as well as the major broadcasters. One might soon be able to make a living doing this. 

As for the professionals in the UK, none, as yet, offer radio programmes for download. The BBC, for example, allows listeners to stream certain old programmes, depending on the rights owned by the BBC. Radio Four leads in this: its Listen Again page offers much of the previous week's listening. 

That these programmes are only available as RealPlayer streams is irrelevant to the determined. Cheap applications are available to record RealPlayer streams, and Windows Media for that matter, and convert them to MP3, ready for a waiting iPod. 

The latest versions can even be set to start and stop recording at a certain time, allowing you to time-shift your radio listening, create schedules of your own devising, and then carry it away from your desk. 

Curiously, despite the relative ease of ripping radio shows and audio books, there appears to be very little illegal sharing of these files going on. According to Audible's research, Korzen says, this is because the demographic audience who want to listen to talk radio and speaking books, are unlikely to steal them. Stealing music is one thing, he says, but stealing books is just not cool. 

While these downloads are all in the traditional radio style, the low cost of producing audio for the internet means more interesting stuff can be done. QuietAmerican.org, for example, is a beautiful collection of sound recordings made while travelling around south-east Asia. Too short and context-free for broadcast, they're perfect for downloading or listening to online. More traditional bloggers, too, are creating little snippets of audio, often by calling a special phone number. 

Paid-up users of LiveJournal can do this, as can subscribers to Audblog.com, who can create audio postings to any Movable Type, Radio Userland, LiveJournal or Blogger weblog. LiveJournal's recordings are in Ogg Vorbis format, which few handheld devices can deal with, but Audblogs are in plain old MP3: perfect for pulling down and listening to on the bus. 

The battle over which recording format to use is continuous and part of the charm of the cutting edge of internet content. There's MP3 of course, others might like Ogg, more still Wav; One great site, Greasyskillet.org, uses QuickTime audio files. But this all goes to point out the increasingly loud and clear message from these audio producing sites: that this sort of thing is no longer the preserve of the professional, or the rich. 

Grant Henninger, a popular weblogger from California, makes a good example. He started to record his own five-minute radio show for his site: "I had planned to make a show, instead of just random thoughts - to show that it could be done," he says. "Other people were already doing it, and they were doing it well - they had shows that sounded like they could go on the radio." 

The quality, he said, blew him away, until he did it himself: a cheap microphone, free recording software, a little practice, and Grant - now on his second show, downloadable from his site - sounds just as good. It was, he says, easy. 

This discovery, like Lydon's revelation of finding an audience that talks back to him, and like Audible discovering a market for radio programmes that you can carry around and listen to whenever you like, is the final part of the birth of audioblogging. We're going from the ease of putting words online, to the new ease of putting radio there too. 

"We will not go back to genuflecting to all these one-way top-down ways of disseminating news," says Lydon. We'll make it ourselves, and listen to it whenever we like. 

**Talk can be cheap**

Technologists have also embraced the idea of downloadable radio programming. 

**·** The Web Talk Guys - Rob and Dana Greenlee - broadcast their show on a handful of local FM stations in the US, but allow anyone to download their shows from their site. 

**·** Craig Crossman's Computer America is freely available, along with many other shows, from BusinessTalkRadio.net. 

**·** Mark Shander's tech show can be heard via Shander.com. 

**·** Dave Graveline presents Into Tomorrow on Miami's 610 WIOD-AM, or on your iPod via Graveline.com. 

Not content with timeshifting your radio listening by a few days? How about a few decades? Rusc.com is a members-only site, offering 6,000 American radio shows from the 30s, 40s and 50s. Closer to home, Imperial College Radio archives everything in MP3: downloadable as you wish.

# BBC NEWS | Technology | Apple brings podcasts into iTunes
![BBC NEWS | Technology | Apple brings podcasts into iTunes]()
 

**Apple plans to police which podcasts make it into the directory of shows available via its iTunes program.**

As expected, the new version of the music jukebox software includes the ability to download podcasts. 

By providing a directory of 3,000 shows, Apple says it is taking podcasting into the mainstream. 

The software also allows people to send in their podcasts for inclusion on the list, but Apple will vet these due to editorial and copyright concerns. 

**Rising popularity**

Podcasts are downloadable audio shows that can be created and listened to by anyone with the right equipment. 

Podcasts have grown quickly in popularity as they are an easy way of getting digital content and playing it when and where you want. 

They have also become popular because anyone with a microphone, computer, software and a net connection, can produce one themselves. 

Their rising popularity is challenging conventional radio's broadcasting and business model. As a result, many radio stations such as the BBC are making their shows available as downloadable MP3 files. 

Apple first announced it was tapping into the demand for podcasts last month, when its boss Steve Jobs showed how iTunes would let people access, organise and sync-up shows to any digital music player. 

"This is really going to drive podcasting to the next level," said Stan Ng, director of iPod worldwide marketing. 

"We really are embracing podcasting, making it easy for people to manage, listen and subscribe to podcasts." 

**Podcast gatekeeper?**

People can access a directory of podcasts through Apple's online music store. At the moment there are 3,000 free audio shows available worldwide. 

"We've tried to include as many as possible," said Mr Ng, adding that iTunes has a system for people to submit their podcasts to be included in the directory. 

He explained that the submissions would go through an editorial process to make sure there were no copyright issues or that they did not include objectionable content. 

"We're not trying to be the gatekeeper of podcasting," he insisted. "We wanted to make it easy for people to publish their podcasts." 

Having podcasts as part of the iTunes music store opens up the possibility selling them, just like music. 

But Mr Ng refused to be drawn on the issue. "We haven't announced any fee-based podcasts at this time." 

Apple has also updated its iPod line with colour displays and lowering prices. A software update for the click-wheel iPods and the iPod minis will offer a podcast menu, including bookmarking and the ability to show podcast artwork.

![» EXCLUSIVE: Apple Trademark Office docs point to REAL reasons for” Podcast” controversy | IP Telephony, VoIP, Broadband | ZDNet.com]()
 

![ipodtrademarksearch_1.jpg](http://web.archive.org/web/20061005115913im_/http://blogs.zdnet.com/images/ipodtrademarksearch_1.jpg)

When I [first learned](http://web.archive.org/web/20061005115913/http://blog.wired.com/music/index.blog?entry_id=1561308) that Apple was sending "infringement"-claiming cease and desist letters to Podcasters such as [Podcast Ready](http://web.archive.org/web/20061005115913/http://www.podcastready.com/) my first reaction was: OK, iPod has been around for <strike>two</strike> five years, (**sorry-typo**) and "podcast" two years, so why is Apple doing this _now_? Especially when the term "podcast" conveys enhanced market familiarization with the iPod?

Rather than fall back on knee-jerk assumptions: fear of trademark "dilution," Apple’s proprietary, non-collegial and litigious culture, I decided to do more digging.

Based on my detailed review of related documents I found on in the Trademark section of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office website, I believe I know more about why Apple is freaking out about the use of "podcast" as an infringe against its trademarked iPod.

There are three groups of reasons.

Not reported so far but revealed here, it appears that:

Apple itself is seeking a Trademark for "IPodcast."

Apple has been experiencing some significant difficulties getting final approval from the USPTO for the iPod trademark.

Finally, Apple has trademark applications on file for significantly expanding the iPod brand beyond devices, to other merchandise.

I am now going to take you through some recent documentation that will further explain these issues.

On September 4, 2005, Apple applied for a Word Mark for IPODCAST. The application is **#78706746**.

Reading this application we learn that it is for:

> Telecommunication access services; communication by computer; transmission of data and of information by electronic means, broadcasting or transmission of radio and television programs; provision of telecommunications connections to computer databases and the Internet; electronic transmission of streamed and downloadable audio and video files via computer and other communications networks; web casting services; delivery of messages by electronic transmission; provision of telecommunications connections to electronic communications networks, for transmission or reception of audio, video or multimedia content; streaming of video content, streaming and subscription audio broadcasting of spoken word, music, concerts, and radio programs, broadcasting prerecorded videos featuring music and entertainment, television programs, motion pictures, news, sports, games, cultural events, and entertainment-related programs of all kinds, via computer and other communications networks; providing on-line bulletin boards for the transmission of messages among computer users concerning entertainment in the nature of music, concerts, videos, radio, television, film, news, sports, games and cultural events; communication services namely, matching users for the transfer of music, video and audio recordings via communication networks provision of information, consultancy and advisory services for all the aforesaid services.

What’s even more revealing is that when we examine recent documentation related to this filing, we see a pattern.

In January of this year Trademark examining attorney Caroline Wood took Apple’s original Trademark application and sent it back to Apple as "unacceptable."

From the document sent by Ms. Wood to Apple legal:

_RECITATION OF SERVICES UNACCEPTABLE_

> The current recitation of services is unacceptable because terms are overly broad and indefinite.  The applicant must indicate the specific nature of the services.  Telecommunications services are classified in several different classes, the applicant must indicate the specific services.  Also, the term “computer intercommunication” is indefinite.  Also, "time sharing services are indefinite because with regard to computers the services are classified in Class 42.  The terms “access and links” are indefinite, the applicant may indicate providing telecommunications connections instead.  Also, operating search engines is classified in Class 42.  “Telecommunication of information (including web pages), computer programs and any other data” is indefinite.  Please note that, while an application may be amended to clarify or limit the identification, additions to the identification are not permitted.  37 C.F.R. §2.71(a); TMEP §1402.06.  Therefore, the applicant may not amend to include any services that are not within the scope of the services recited in the present identification.

After suggesting alternative phrasing that would have a higher chance of acceptance, Ms. Wood closed her correspondence with this admonition:

> Please note that, while an application may be amended to clarify or limit the identification, additions to the identification are not permitted.  37 C.F.R. §2.71(a); TMEP §1402.06.  Therefore, the applicant may not amend to include any services that are not within the scope of the services recited in the present identification.

Apple reworded the IPODCAST application and sent it in on July 11. In a reply dated July 27: better, but not quite good enough, the Trademark examiner essentially replied.

> This letter responds to applicant’s communication filed July 11, 2006.  The examining attorney accepts the amendments with regard to the recitation of services, the foreign registration and the basis.  However, the examining attorney maintains and makes final the refusal with regard to the validity of the Section 44(e) basis.

I should point out that at the top of this correspondence, Trademark examiner Wood added this ALL-CAPS zinger of a scold:

> RESPONSE TIME LIMIT:  TO AVOID ABANDONMENT, THE OFFICE MUST RECEIVE A PROPER RESPONSE TO THIS OFFICE ACTION WITHIN 6 MONTHS OF THE MAILING OR E-MAILING DATE.

I also must mention that the iPod trademark application is at a delicate stage. Serial number 78653669 was published for opposition on July 11. No opposition was logged within the 30-day period, but now the USPTO must render final judgment.

It is reasonable to assume that Apple wants to make things totally right with the USPTO, and at this point they are extremely sensitive to the controversies surrounding IPODCAST. When they see "podcast" this, podcast that, Apple- given their existing, proprietary-inclined mindset- seems to be wanting to ward off any complications. The fewer non-Apple "pods" related branding efforts out there, the easier it must seem to them. Less occlusion for the related names they are seeking to trademark.

On the third matter- Apple’s plans for iPod related gear- Apple also seems to be in one fine mess. Take for example the current problems Apple seems to be having obtaining final Trademark approval for "IPOD Socks"- a character mark not for socks on the feet, but for, as Apple calls it: "Cases and bags specifically adapted for carrying computers and consumer electronics, namely, portable and handheld digital electronic devices for recording, organizing, transmitting, manipulating, and reviewing text, data, audio and video files."

The latest Office Action from Trademark examiner Ronald McMorrow, is dated May 11. I know that sounds awhile back, but thus far Apple has not replied. 

McMorrow seemed to be telling Apple to get its act together when he wrote:

> The specimen submitted does not show proper trademark use because the mark as it appears in the catalog or website display is not shown in close proximity to a picture of the goods.  A printed or web catalog or similar specimen is only acceptable to show trademark use if it includes (1) a picture of the relevant goods, (2) the mark appearing sufficiently near the picture of the goods so as to associate the mark with the goods, and (3) information necessary to order the goods (e.g., sales form, price list, instructions for ordering, etc.).  _In re Dell Inc_., 71 USPQ2d 1725 (TTAB 2004); _see_ _Lands’ End Inc. v. Manbeck,_ 797 F. Supp. 511, 24 USPQ2d 1314 (E.D. Va. 1992); _In re MediaShare Corporation_, 43 USPQ2d 1304 (TTAB 1997); TMEP §904.06(a)-(b).
> 
> Applicant must submit (1) a substitute specimen showing the mark as it is used in commerce on the goods or on packaging for the goods, and (2) a statement that “the substitute specimen was in use in commerce at least as early as the filing date of the application,” verified with a notarized affidavit or a signed declaration under 37 C.F.R. §2.20.  37 C.F.R. §§2.56 and 2.59(a); TMEP §§904.01 _et seq._ and 904.09.
> 
> Examples of acceptable specimens for goods are tags, labels, instruction manuals, containers, photographs that show the mark on the goods or packaging, or displays associated with the goods at their point of sale.  TMEP §§904.04 _et seq_.
> 
> Applicant must disclaim the descriptive wording “SOCKS” apart from the mark as shown because it merely describes a feature or characteristic of the goods.  Trademark Act Section 6, 15 U.S.C. §1056; TMEP §§1213 and 1213.03(a).  The goods are “Cases and bags specifically adapted for carrying computers and consumer electronics, namely, portable and handheld digital electronic devices for recording, organizing, transmitting, manipulating, and reviewing text, data, audio and video files.” As evidence of the descriptiveness of SOCKS, the examining attorney has attached a webpage that advertises the goods.  The term is used descriptively in the advertisement, which states “slide your iPod into the sock to keep it safe and warm.”

At that point, the examiner essentially gave Apple a schoolboy lecture on the need for a disclaimer, and what that ought to be: 

> The computerized printing format for the _Trademark Official Gazette_ requires a standard form for a disclaimer.   TMEP §1213.08(a)(i).  A properly worded disclaimer should read as follows:
> 
> No claim is made to the exclusive right to use SOCKS apart from the mark as shown.

So to sum up, we have Apple, maker of the iPod, trying to get right with the Trademark office about achieving formal Trademark and related mark protections for iPod AND its sought-after IPODCAST applications.

I am not an attorney, but if I were on Apple’s legal team fighting to make things right with these two important marks, I just might be tempted to use an overabundance of vigilance against anyone who is selling services and products that in name, are coming close to these sought-after protections.

As I noted at the top of this admittedly lengthy post, I happen to believe that "podcast" is great, if unintentional, marketing for the iPod. But Apple is Apple, with their own proprietary corporate culture. 

And when you examine some of the controversies I have documented here through the lens of that culture, you may be able to see why they are sending out cease-and-desist letters to podcasters- and at this junction in time.

Hello friends! Do you fancy listening to “a new type of time-shifted amateur radio”? No? How about a brilliant podcast? Of course you do.

Fifteen years ago, _Mac__world_, a magazine for fans of Apple products, announced, with limited fanfare, that Apple was about to add podcasts to iTunes, its music download offer. Unfortunately, few readers knew what a podcast was, hence _Mac__world_’s “time-shifted radio” definition. In June 2005, the idea of having thousands of ready-to-hear audio shows, anything from true-crime documentaries to all-chums-together comedy, to up-to-the-minute news to gripping drama to revealing interviews, and being able to listen to these shows whenever you want, wherever you are – well, that wasn’t quite happening. So Apple’s move didn’t seem important. Nor did the fact that the Oxford English Dictionary added “podcast” to its lexicon in the same year, after tech journalist Ben Hammersley came up with the term in 2004 (which was also the year the BBC launched a downloadable version of _[In Our Time](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006qykl)_)**. **Podcasts were new. It takes time for the new to become everyday.

Podcasts were mostly unheard of, except by the tech savvy. They were either downloadable** **versions of existing radio shows or they were chatty riffs, made by amateurs who knew how to upload their aural blogs online. Still, they were interesting. At least to me. Soon after podcasts’ iTunes debut, I started a new job as the _Observer_’s radio critic. Great job – except there was a limited choice of programmes for me to review. Radio schedules rarely changed. Presenters stayed in their jobs for years. The BBC dominated speech radio, aside from phone-ins; hardly any other broadcaster had the money to make documentaries or drama.

Podcasts rescued me from aural monotony; I wrote my first piece about them in the summer of 2006. Apparently _[Coke Machine Glow](http://cokemachineglow.com/podcasts/)_ and _[The Dawn and Drew Show](http://thedawnanddrewshow.com/)_ were the ones to look out for (me neither, now). The podcast I do recall from then is _[The Ricky Gervais Show](https://www.therickygervaisshow.com/podcasts)_; this dominated the brand new iTunes podcast chart for weeks. Initially free, in early 2006 it switched to a pay-per-listen model and proved both a forerunner and an outlier: since then, much podcast uptake has been driven by comedy, but most shows are still free to listeners, paid for by adverts that appear during episodes.

Today, the iTunes podcast chart is bustling with old hands and new kids on the block. Here are _[No Such Thing As ](https://www.nosuchthingasafish.com/)__[a Fish](https://www.nosuchthingasafish.com/)_, Fearne Cotton’s _[Happy Place](https://www.officialfearnecotton.com/news/2018/2/26/happy-place-podcast)_, _[That Peter Crouch Podcast](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p06kyljg/episodes/downloads)_, _[Katherine Ryan: Telling Everybody Everything](https://kathbum.podbean.com/)_. Here are sections for new and noteworthy, cultivating calm, keeping the kids busy. There are lists of the top 10 episodes, top 10 shows; all aside from the 19 other regular categories: news, arts, true crime… So many podcasts! There are oodles of shows, too many to ever get through.

## Gold rush

This is podcasting’s boom time. There are now more than 900,000 podcasts to choose from. In the US, 22% of the population listens to at least one podcast every week and 51% to at least one podcast in their life (roughly 168 million people). In the UK, 12.5% of us (about 7.1 million people) listen to podcasts weekly, up 58% in the past two years.** **And on average, those UK podcast fans are hoovering up approximately seven podcasts a week. Even throughout lockdown, when other art forms closed or stopped producing, podcasts have continued to grow. The big shows just got bigger.

Podcasts have taken off across the world. In South Korea, [58% of the population](https://www.podcastinsights.com/podcast-statistics/) has listened to a podcast in the past month –more than 30 million people – while in Spain the figure is 40% (more than 18.5million). And there’s evidence that our ever-expanding love of listening is part of a wider shift to audio. Recently, a media analyst gave a talk about about current and upcoming trends. He noted that car radios are digital, speakers can be blue-toothed, in-ear headphones are more and more popular (Apple sold an estimated 60 million pairs of its [wireless AirPods](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-11-22/apple-airpods-shipments-are-said-to-double-to-60-million-in-2019) last year), as are home AI systems with Alexa and Google Home. We’re absorbing more content through our ears than ever before, he said, because we can do other things as we listen and in the future, as smart headphones get smarter, our ears, rather than our eyes, may well become the main way we connect to the internet.

Still, that’s the future. For now, perhaps the biggest indicator that podcasts are having their moment is the way big players are moving in, whether brands or celebrities.** **In 2019, Spotify made an eye-watering financial investment, buying Gimlet Media and Parcast (which make podcasts), as well as Anchor (which provides tools for podcast makers), for a combined stake of [more than £320m](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/feb/06/spotify-buys-podcast-firms-gimlet-and-anchor-streaming-profits-music). Universal has done a deal with Wondery, the American true-crime specialist that produced _[Dirty John](https://wondery.com/shows/dirty-john/)_. Sony has a similar deal with Somethin’ Else, which makes _[David Tennant Does ](https://play.acast.com/s/davidtennant)__[a ](https://play.acast.com/s/davidtennant)__[ Podcast With…](https://play.acast.com/s/davidtennant)_ The BBC, now relieved by its regulator** **of previous restrictions around podcasts, is throwing all efforts at [BBC Sounds](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds), its audio app and podcast platform. Going where Jessie Ware, Fearne Cotton and [George Ezra](https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/mar/02/bland-for-the-reload-why-has-george-ezra-got-a-podcast) have successfully gone before, [Sue Perkins](https://audioboom.com/channel/perkins), [Bradley Wiggins](https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/the-bradley-wiggins-show-by-eurosport/id1404437099), [Matt Lucas](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/brand/p087dgcm) and [the two doctors from ](https://www.iheart.com/podcast/1119-fake-doctors-real-friends-60367049/)_[Scrubs](https://www.iheart.com/podcast/1119-fake-doctors-real-friends-60367049/) _have all got new podcasts. The Obamas signed up to produce exclusive podcasts for Spotify. Even Kim Kardashian is dropping hints.

“Yes, I would say we’re in the podcast gold rush years,” says Matt Deegan, who co-runs the British Podcast awards, as well as overseeing shows such as the Fun Kids’_ _[podcasts](https://www.funkidslive.com/podcasts/#). “But it can definitely get even bigger. Compared with the millions who use TV, or YouTube, or Instagram, podcasting’s numbers are small…”

For quite some time, podcast fans have been of a type: educated Apple users who want to be entertained, but intelligently. (_Observer_ readers, essentially.) There is a massive mainstream audience as yet untapped, though some shows are making inroads; podcasts that discuss popular TV programmes, old and new, are a burgeoning area. So, room for expansion. The questions are: how big can podcasting get? And which shows will get left behind?

![James Corden and David Tennant](https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d7c5628e37eafb601b7b6dbb3682b8c9048a54d4/0_101_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=445&quality=45&auto=format&fit=max&dpr=2&s=9a1fed8b5f34dae83aef6e41cefe1813)

Helen Zaltzman, who hosts and produces _[The Allusionist](https://www.theallusionist.org/)_ – and, since 2007, the immensely popular _[Answer Me This!](https://answermethispodcast.com/)_ with Olly Mann – thinks that big companies could bring some more trust to the medium. “Their investment demonstrates that podcasting isn’t just made by amateurs in a garage,” she says.

But the independence of podcasting, the wild and wonderfulness of its offerings, its glorious niche-ness, where someone with a great idea or mad obsession can make a small show that turns into a roaring success… Zaltzman worries that this will be “steamrollered by big, bland chat series with enormous marketing budgets”. This would be, at the very least, galling. After all, without _[99% Invisible](https://99percentinvisible.org/)_ there would be no _[Impaulsive with Logan Paul](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGeBogGDZ9W3dsGx-mWQGJA)_; without _[Kermode and Mayo’s Film Review](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00lvdrj)_, no _[Gemma Collins Podcast](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p07kjlz7)_. Outliers light the way for the popular.

## The app gap

Today, in the UK, we mostly get our aural hits via Apple, BBC Sounds, Spotify and – this may sound weird to some – YouTube. Listeners under 35 use YouTube more than any other platform to get their podcasts, often listening while doing other things, such as playing computer games ([Joe Rogan](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzQUP1qoWDoEbmsQxvdjxgQ), one of the world’s most successful podcasters, with 8 million subscribers, is most often accessed on YouTube). YouTubers are moving into podcasting, by the way: football YouTube sensation [Miniminter](https://www.youtube.com/user/miniminter) has a new podcast, as does [JaackMaate](https://www.youtube.com/user/JaackMaate).

Some podcasting history. For quite a few years, like many others, I found my podcasts via websites and through iTunes. This required me to be near my laptop, though I could download shows on to my creaky iPod (iPhones didn’t come along until 2007; I got my first in 2011). Podcasting’s accessibility was a problem: there were great shows out there, but most people had no idea how to get them.

It’s unusual to have brilliant content without a convenient platform – it’s like a great chef without a restaurant – and it’s this mismatch that has long held podcasting back. Usually, the platform exists, the content grows to fill it and then both grow together. But podcasts existed for ages before they were truly easy to hear. It wasn’t until 2012, when Apple put a standalone podcast app on its iPhones, that podcasts became easily accessible (for iPhone users) and podcasting started to take off in the UK. Soon after, 4G and more widespread wifi made it possible to hear a podcast wherever you were.

Then, in 2014, _[Serial](https://serialpodcast.org/)_ came out. This who-really-dunnit re-examination of a cold case murder, led by _[This American Life](https://www.thisamericanlife.org/)_ veteran Sarah Koenig, massively boosted podcasting’s profile. In every English-speaking country, there is evidence of “the _Serial_ effect” and the show also gave podcasting an identifiable style for a few years, one where the presenter showed their workings in their commentary (what we might call the “I get that. But I still wanted to know…” style). In 2015, _[My Dad Wrote ](https://www.mydadwroteaporno.com/#intro1)__[a Porno](https://www.mydadwroteaporno.com/#intro1)_ became another enormous [UK hit](https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/jun/30/my-dad-wrote-a-porno-podcast) and advertisers – other than early adopters Squarespace – started to take note. _[Brexitcast](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m0008cx6)_ brought in a lot of new listeners in 2017, as did _That Peter Crouch Podcast_ in 2018 and _[Shagged Married Annoyed](https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/sh-ged-married-annoyed/id1451489585)_ last year.

But still, if we’re honest, podcasts have been The Next Big Thing ever since I’ve been writing about them and their reaching the mainstream has been a stop-start process. Even now, there are plenty of people who don’t listen and many who have only just started. Why? Access. The problem – still – is how podcasts are delivered.

“There’s no perfect app for podcasts,” says Zaltzman. “They are all a bit clunky, because they’re free, so there’s no real reason to make them great. The people who make the apps don’t make their own podcasts, they just host other people’s work.”

> We put all our time and energy into getting the right people on our shows. We just wind them up and let them go

Andrew Harrison, Podmasters

This is changing. After Spotify’s splashy podcasting entrance, Gimlet is now busily making shows for the streaming service. BBC Sounds hosts BBC podcasts, but has promised to expand to hosting other shows in the future. (During the coronavirus pandemic, it has agreed to host Fun Kids’ excellent _[Stuck@Home](https://www.funkidslive.com/podcast/stuck/)_.) In the US, Luminary, which hoped to be the Netflix of podcasting (ie a subscription model), had a bumpy launch in 2019, with several established shows pulling out from being on the network. But it undoubtedly made some big signings, including Russell Brand’s _[Under the Skin](https://luminarypodcasts.com/listen/russell-brand-395/under-the-skin-with-russell-brand-luminary-exclusive/d55de7eb-6f34-48e6-aee4-48703f8fb675?country=US)_ and _[Love + Radio](http://loveandradio.org/)_, and it makes its own shows with celebrities such as Trevor Noah and Karamo Brown from _Queer Eye_. (The subscription model might seem an obvious way for podcasts to go, but faces reluctance from listeners used to getting podcasts for free while suffering the adverts that pay for them.)

Matt Hartman, who works for Betaworks, an American startup studio and venture capitalist company that invested in Gimlet in 2014, points out that most podcast apps just do the same thing: “Let people search for and subscribe to shows and that’s it.” He says, diplomatically, that he is “looking forward” to app innovation, mentioning [Breaker](https://www.breaker.audio/) as an app that’s different: it’s well laid out, has social functions, lets you search for individual episodes and automatically imports all your existing podcast subscriptions. (Breaker is also easy for podcasters to use and gives more listening information, which apps have previously been reluctant to hand out.)

But at the moment, Apple’s basic Podcast app dominates in the UK. This is despite the fact that most people don’t own iPhones. Android phone users have various ways to get podcasts, though it took until 2018 for Google to put out Google Podcasts (before that, you had to go via Google Play). Now, Google Podcasts can be used on iPhones too and you can search for individual phrases within shows. There are other apps: Podcast Player, Pocket Casts (which charges a one-off fee), Stitcher, Castbox. So many, but unless Google Podcasts catches on, Spotify seems to be the most likely to threaten Apple’s dominance.

And the iTunes podcast chart, with its incomprehensible algorithms, is still where podcasters want to be, though the chart doesn’t work in quite the same way as the UK’s Top 40. Instead, says Deegan, “it’s about momentum”. Momentum means a new show can make a splash and enter the iTunes top 10. The real talent is in making that show stick and, of course, making money from it. Such mainstream hits as _[The High Low](https://play.acast.com/s/thehighlowshow)_, _Peter Crouch_, _[The Receipts](https://open.spotify.com/show/3GMZiZnqL4Hib6DD5PGhdj)_, _David Tennant…_, _[The Adam Buxton Podcast](https://adam-buxton.co.uk/podcasts)_ and _My Dad Wrote __a Porno_ act as starter programmes. Once people listen and love them, they are more likely to try others.

Yet our podcasting industry is a couple of years behind the US. Partly, this is because of our thriving radio sector; as Zaltzman points out, given the choice between a regular paid job at BBC radio and the uncertain economics of podcasting, many producers opt for the former. Things are changing, though: the BBC is losing its audio dominance, at least among young people. Other broadcasters have been quick to launch podcasts, or their own app ([Global](https://www.globalplayer.com/)’s is good), and Deegan knows of many podcasters, “brilliant broadcasters”, who have never worked in radio.

Andrew Harrison, who runs a small podcasting company, Podmasters, is one of those. Having worked for nearly 30 years in magazines, he started making podcasts in 2016. One of them – _[Remainiacs](https://audioboom.com/channel/remainiacs-podcast)_, an anti-Brexit show that pulls in several big players, including Tony Blair – became a hit, and, from that, the company has launched political show _[The Bunker](https://play.acast.com/s/the-bunker)_ and started producing other people’s podcasts. What Harrison likes, he says, is the direct nature of podcasting. All the investment is in the show, he explains: there are no printing or distribution costs, no investment in drama scripts and in building sets. “We put all our time and energy into getting the right people on our shows,” he says. “And then we just wind them up, let them go, record and edit and get the show out to listeners.”

A simple process: idea, execution, direct delivery to consumer. Several podcast producers and presenters I talk to contrast this with the traditional teeth-pulling procedure of making shows for the [BBC](https://www.theguardian.com/media/bbc). There, you “sit down in front of a Rupert and listen as your great idea is tweaked to within an inch of its life and then proposed as a vehicle for Sue Perkins or Romesh Ranganathan,” says one producer. “Why bother?”

Presenters don’t have it easy, either: one high-profile BBC host has been promised a podcast for the past two years, yet every suggestion they make for a show is rejected. No wonder BBC regulars such as Clara Amfo, Annie Mac and Clare Balding have recently brought out podcasts independently.

So, we’re getting more British podcasts. Perhaps we’ll catch up to the US soon? Deegan isn’t so sure. He says the main reason UK podcasts don’t smash the American market is that “Britain doesn’t have celebrities that Americans have heard of. David Tennant’s podcast has done well, because Americans know who he is.” No doubt if Tom Holland or Idris Elba decided to make a podcast, it would go down brilliantly. But as podcasts move into the mainstream, they need mainstream stars to move with them.

There is an argument, though, that niche is where it’s at, especially when niche goes big. The most popular podcasts in the UK are made by enthusiasts, from _Kermode and Mayo_ to _My Dad Wrote a Porno_. Jamie Morton, with his other _MDWAP_ hosts, James Cooper and Alice Levine, has now done a full world tour twice, selling out the Sydney Opera House and New York’s Radio City Music Hall. Still, he says that when he moved into a new house recently, he had to explain to his neighbour what he did, “which was embarrassing. They didn’t know what a podcast was and the title was a bit… suspect.”

This combination of being under the radar for most people, but popular enough to sell out the Albert Hall, demonstrates the Big Niche appeal of podcasting. Morton describes _MDWAP_ events as being “like Comic Con: fans dress up as characters, they come by themselves and make friends when they’re at the show”. Podcasting appears to be going through the same arc as YouTube, in that its oldest stars have grown themselves by getting in early and posting regularly on an untested platform. Like YouTubers, the most popular podcasters, who draw huge audiences to their live shows, are able to walk around unnoticed by the vast majority of the population. Real celebrities – film stars, singers, chatshow hosts – come in later.

So, can Big Niche go Big Big? Perhaps not. First, podcasts don’t really do music very well, due to rights issues. And second, they have always been about individual listening, on headphones. It’s emphatically not a shared experience, listening to a podcast. Which is why many people find it hard to convert. They want a voice chuntering in the background, not someone whispering in their ear. Headphones can feel oppressive and podcasts are too intimate (or sweary!) to blast out to everyone in the room.

Podcasts, in the end, are just too personal. Too niche, whether small niche or big. Which is, of course, why we fans love them. They’re ours.

![DIY radio with PODcasting | Doc Searls' IT Garage]()
 

There was a time — until my late 30s, I guess — when most of my radio listening was to music. Then there was a time — roughly the last couple decades — when most of my radio listening was to [NPR](https://web.archive.org/web/20060318131042/http://www.npr.org/) and talk radio. When that got boring in the morning, I'd switch to [Howard Stern](https://web.archive.org/web/20060318131042/http://howardstern.com/).

But there was a problem for me with talk radio, as there had been with music radio; and that was a growing irrelevance. Or a growing _awareness_ of the irrelevance that had always been there.

Since the Net and the Web came along in the early and mid-90s, I've had a growing impatience with waiting around for stuff on the radio I _might_ care about. Another way to look at it: _All_ radio, commercial and noncommercial, including what we call the "content", was turning into the same kind of stuff-to-endure as the advertising and promotional announcements that paid for it.

But now most of my radio listening is to what Adam Curry and others are starting to call [podcasts](https://web.archive.org/web/20060318131042/http://www.google.com/search?q=podcasts). That last link currently brings up 24 results on Google. A year from now, it will pull up hundreds of thousands, or perhaps even millions.

So this morning, here in my hotel room, I listened to [the latest edition (September 27)](https://web.archive.org/web/20060318131042/http://homepage.mac.com/adamcurry/DSC/DSC-2004-09-27.mp3) of [Adam Curry](https://web.archive.org/web/20060318131042/http://live.curry.com/)'s [Daily Source Code](https://web.archive.org/web/20060318131042/http://radio.weblogs.com/0001014/categories/dailySourceCode/), Dave Winer's [Morning Coffee Notes](https://web.archive.org/web/20060318131042/http://static.scripting.com/blogs/gems/dnc/cnSept27.mp3) [about](https://web.archive.org/web/20060318131042/http://archive.scripting.com/2004/09/28#When:1:57:13AM) the [open-sourcing](https://web.archive.org/web/20060318131042/http://kernel.scripting.com/2004/09/28#a20) of [Frontier](https://web.archive.org/web/20060318131042/http://kernel.scripting.com/2004/09/28#a20), and [a conversation between Adam and Dave](https://web.archive.org/web/20060318131042/http://homepage.mac.com/adamcurry/TS/TS-2004-09-28.mp3) about all the above, [iPodder](https://web.archive.org/web/20060318131042/http://www.ipodder.org/), [Trade Secrets Radio](https://web.archive.org/web/20060318131042/http://secrets.scripting.com/) and much more.

In the midst were references back to [the 24 September Gillmor Gang](https://web.archive.org/web/20060318131042/http://www.itconversations.com/shows/detail206.html) where iPodder, podcasting, Adam and the new radio platform were mentioned, plus [Evil Genius Chronicles](https://web.archive.org/web/20060318131042/http://www.evilgeniuschronicles.org/), a blog/podcast home where (among many other things) Dave Slusher corrects errors he hears on the Gillmor Gang.

At one point I paused to re-read Steve Gillmor's [If RSS Ain't Broke...](https://web.archive.org/web/20060318131042/http://news.zdnet.com/2100-3513_22-5383118.html), which makes sense of what's actually happening here, which is the emergence of a whole new form of broadcasting that's DIY in the Xtreme.

The key virtue of traditional radio is its immediacy: the fact that it's live. They key virtue of this new breed of radio is that it's Net-native. That is, it's archived in a way that can be listened to at the convenience of the listener, and (this is key) that it can be linked to by others, and [enclosed](https://web.archive.org/web/20060318131042/http://www.thetwowayweb.com/payloadsforrss) in an [RSS](https://web.archive.org/web/20060318131042/http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/tech/rss) feed.

It's because of that last feature that Adam could create iPodder, which automatically routes a podcast to an iPod (it's what Adam calls "an iPod filling station"). Note, as I said [Sunday](https://web.archive.org/web/20060318131042/http://garage.docsearls.com/node/view/460), that this does not need to be limited to iPods. iPodder is just one implementation that addresses the device that has become the modern equivalent of the transistor radio (the first truly personal portable radios, which not coincidentally made rock & roll happen in the 50s and 60s).

What matters is that all the standards we're working with here are open. They're the new and growing infrastructure for a new class of 'casting. It won't replace old-fashioned _broad_casting, just as FM didn't replace AM, and TV didn't replace radio. And it's not _narrow_casting, which is conceived as broadcasting for fewer people. It's _pod_casting. I'll create an acronym for it: **P**ersonal **O**ption **D**igital 'casting.

(Should we call it PODcasting, then, to make it clear that we're talking about a category and not one company's product? Let's try.)

PODcasting will shift much of our time away from _an old medium where we wait for what we **might** want to hear_ to _a new medium where we choose **what** we want to hear, **when** we want to hear it, and **how** we want to give everybody else the option to listen to it as well_.

I hesitate to promote it, because, as Adam points out, the [NAB](https://web.archive.org/web/20060318131042/http://www.nab.org/) — National Association of Broadcasters — is one of the most powerful lobbying organizations on Earth: far more influential, even, than the RIAA. (For more about that, and other alternatives to traditional radio, read Scott Woolley's [Broadcast Bullies](https://web.archive.org/web/20060318131042/http://www.forbes.com/home/forbes/2004/0906/134.html), at Forbes.) And the day will come, perhaps soon, when commercial broadcasters, and perhaps even NPR affiliates, will feel threatened by personal podcasting.

So what the hell. Let's bring it on.

Meanwhile, a big thanks to Adam, Dave, and the other pioneers making this thing happen.

Also a plug for [Ogg Vorbis](https://web.archive.org/web/20060318131042/http://www.xiph.org/ogg/vorbis/), which Adam mentioned, but needs to pay more attention to (hint, hint). Ogg has been waiting around for something like this to happen, for waaay too long.
