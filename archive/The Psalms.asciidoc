The Psalms]

== ‚ÄΩ‚ÄΩ‚ÄΩ

The Psalms (alternatively/interchangeably entitled Bilge) is a
monobyline World Wide Web Blog written by
https://bit.ly/whoisdavidblue[*ùíüùí∂ùìãùíæùíπ ‚Ñ¨ùìÅùìä‚ÑØ*] (good morning!) observing
and selectively amplifying the characters, organizations, and stories
surrounding the most abrupt, profound, and spectacular communicative
renaissance in the history of the human species.

Less abstractly, its beat is *wholly digital*, namely in *tools*
(software, services, and methodologies) and *culture* (music, film,
podcasts, and media) from a distinct lens established at good distance
from California.

It is
https://gist.github.com/extratone/140a11428b5dd1dda500b3928e0438b1[unlicensed]
and entirely
https://tomcritchlow.com/2020/07/23/thinking-in-public/[written in
public] largely via https://github.com/extratone/bilge[*this GitHub
Repository*], supplemented by experiments on a variety of
https://www.notion.so/rotund/9fdc8e9610b34b8f991ebc148b760055?v=c170b58650c04fbdb7adc551a73d16a7[other
platforms], including (arguably) https://twitter.com/NeoYokel[my Twitter
account].

For better or worse, my voice as represented in _The Psalms_ has
continued to be saturated with self-referential and occasionally
self-disparaging/deprecating qualification. If I am indeed an authority
on myself, I would suggest that these are essential tools rather than
crutches, and note that I have made some progress in excusing myself for
them out of the (perhaps clich√©) realization that ‚Äúlife‚Äù ‚Äì and
especially _truth_ ‚Äì can be infinitely complicated, and therefore
worthwhile thought on just about anything is inevitably going to be
(sometimes aggravatingly) tedious in its complexity.

*I am not a paid journalist* and *I don‚Äôt break stories*. That‚Äôs not to
say that I wouldn‚Äôt if an opportunity happened upon me, but it is not
where I‚Äôm at my best.

[[section0002.xhtml#what-does-the-psalms-cover]]
=== What does _The Psalms_ cover?

Primarily, this blog exists to amplify
https://github.com/extratone/bilge/wiki/Terminology---Undercovered[undercovered]
developers, musicians, writers, curators, and media professionals, most
often through the process of *analyzing their work*.

Some recent examples include
https://anchor.fm/davidblue/episodes/Brad-Varol--Father-of-Whyp-es12ge[my
interview with Brad Varol], who‚Äôs creating a handy web tool for sharing
audio (replacing Clyp) and https://bilge.world/iphone-ios-music-apps[my
guide to music apps on iPhone].

Two more _significant_ examples:
https://bilge.world/eugen-rochko-interview[my interview with Mastodon
creator Eugen Rochko] and
https://bilge.world/bandcamp-streaming-music[my huge case for Bandcamp]
as the streaming service we‚Äôve all been asking for.

[[section0002.xhtml#how-do-you-see-the-world]]
=== How do you see the world?

Anyone _truly_ curious about the answer to this question, for whatever
reason, should read my very-autobiographical essay
‚Äúhttps://bilge.world/why[Why I Write About Technology]‚Äù from 2018,
though my perspective has changed quite significantly in the time,
since.

I‚Äôm going to take further cue from
https://www.notion.so/About-Platformer-22cd48a5514d404b9c2dd130d7724b93[Casey
Newton‚Äôs about page format] and list a few important assumptions of mine
about consumer technology in bullet form:

* The delivery of technology media to the mainstream has lessened its
ability to truly write critically about the big tech companies it now
shares office buildings with.
* The Open Source/Open Web community continues to struggle with their
_brand image_ (if you will) in both old and new ways that needlessly
alienate (and sometimes obfuscate) some of their most important
contributions from the average user. Technology media has failed in
their responsibility to address this issue.
* Women have had a more than equal share in building the digital age and
have yet to be recognized for it.
* Black people have important contributions of all sorts to technology
that have yet to be recognized.
* The software development community is a source of insights in many
aspects of life _other than technology_. It is also often hopelessly
blind to others.
* Technology media has failed to discuss consumer technology‚Äôs presence
in the lives of working class people, to their own detriment.
* The narrative surrounding consumer technology has been allowed by
technology media to shift from products toward organizations and
figureheads, perhaps inevitably.
* The power dynamics found in the stories of Software History have thus
far been underutilized in technology media‚Äôs critical eye on the same
elements in today‚Äôs narratives.

[[section0002.xhtml#how-do-you-get-your-information]]
=== How do you get your information?

Very likely from the same sources you do. As a ‚Äúself-taught‚Äù technology
writer, my go-to sources are constantly changing over time. Recently, I
have been actively making cold emailing a habit whenever I set upon a
given subject, which has produced good results so far. I will more often
than not mention any particulars regarding how I found a specific piece
of information, reference, web page, etc. _in the post itself_. Handily,
https://raindrop.io/user/517010[my various Raindrop feeds] should prove
particularly useful in answering this question in infinite detail. On
the social side, https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/lists[my public Twitter
Lists] should perform the same function.

[[section0002.xhtml#how-can-i-interact-with-the-psalms]]
=== How can I interact with _The Psalms_?

Emailing mailto:davidblue@extratone.com[*davidblue@extratone.com*]
and/or engaging me on
https://twitter.com/NeoYokel[Twitter]/https://mastodon.social/@DavidBlue[Mastodon]
are the simplest ways of getting in touch, but for those interested
and/or uncomfortable with those, there are infinitely many more:

* Because _The Psalms_ is integrated with the annotation service
https://hypothes.is/[Hypothesis], users can literally post public
annotations/page notes [line-through]*via the pullout bar on your right*
(apparently this isn't currently working unless you have the
https://web.hypothes.is/start/[Hypothesis extension] installed in your
browser.)
* GitHub users can engage with https://github.com/extratone/bilge[_The
Psalms_ Repository]. (In theory... This has yet to be tested, so I'd
very much appreciate you giving it a try if you've got time.)
* I've continued to use
https://discord.gg/0b9KQUKP858b0iZF[_Extratone_'s Discord server] as my
general hangout ‚Äì don't be afraid to post there.
* All other social profiles of mine can be found in this
‚Äúhttps://www.notion.so/rotund/Social-Directory-aea1bee51a64461b91bf4de241a4a16d[Social
Directory]‚Äù (which is a Notion database.)

Since I first began working online in 2016, I have grown and maintained
quite a curatorial habit, and therefore sought all sorts of modern
curator's tools. The system I settled upon for some five years: a
dedicated http://bit.ly/extratone[Reading List channel] in _Extratone_'s
Discord. It wasn't until this past year that I encouraged something
which (so far) has exceeded willy-nilly copy-and-paste of URLs into a
single feed. It's an application/bookmarking service called
https://bit.ly/dbraindrop[*Raindrop*] which includes tagging, public,
RSS-enabled collections, and fairy competent web page archiving. I
became a paid subscriber within minutes of discovering its existence,
three months ago, and have since integrated it quite hardily in my
workflow (including automated reposts in that same Discord channel, for
good measure.) For now, the arrangement is sortof experimental, but
obviously, I'm rooting for https://raindrop.io/about[Rustem Mussabekov]
‚Äì sole creator and sentinel of Raindrop.

I have made my tremendous admiration for Casey Newton quite plain over

superhuman. Recently, he
https://onezero.medium.com/casey-newton-on-leaving-the-verge-for-substack-and-the-future-of-tech-journalism-974a646375fa[departed

Dave Pell's https://nextdraft.com/[_Nextdraft_ newsletter] is the only
hard news mailer I would ever recommend. If you can stand his puns, you
need to subscribe. I've recently reduced my actual clicking on hardnews

Blue</a>

I've intermittently recorded https://davidblue.bandcamp.com/[piano
improvs] under my own name (though I haven't properly in a good while.)
On https://davidblue.bandcamp.com/album/four[_Four_], my most recent
improv tape, I used two knockoff SM57s placed directly above my sleepy
childhood upright piano at my mom's house through a USB mixer and
https://youtu.be/p3KoQ6n0xKo[livestreamed most of the recording]. The
result is a fairly good representation of what I was doing musically at
the time and probably the most dynamically interesting of all the
recordings I've captured. The instrument itself has a very particular
dreamy quality that I've never heard on any other.

After writing

Considering my use of Git as a means to track revisions on my own
writing, it's important to note that you should feel free to replace all
instances of ‚Äúsoftware‚Äù in the statement below with ‚Äúwords,‚Äù ‚Äúwriting,‚Äù
‚Äúexpression,‚Äù etc.

While I appreciate tremendously the work and contribution of
https://ar.to/2010/01/set-your-code-free[Arlo Bendiken] in the form of
The Unlicense, I would like to add that I see no need, personally, to
make the refutation of Intellectual Property law regarding my own work
into some profound ethical statement. As it stands, I have not to my
knowledge been the victim of any sort of theft of any kind, and find the
suggestion highly unlikely. If I _am_ made aware of such a case, there
is certainly a possibility that I may change my mind on this issue, so I
suppose I should highlight that *THESE TERMS ARE SUBJECT TO CHANGE*,
though I suspect I would be more flattered and/or amused than actually
offended.

I would also like to annotate that my use of this license should not be
regarded as a suggestion that anyone else follow my example, or that I
‚Äúbelieve in‚Äù taking such action regarding one's work, generally. While I

The principled beginning of The Open Web was a great moment in history,
but ‚Äì like all historical principles ‚Äì it is extremely important that we
consider _context_ and maintain an appropriate level of criticism when
looking back on old manifestos written by old white guys. In general,
try your best to _be reasonable_.

[[section0013.xhtml#america-s-favorite-drivetrain-is-not-ideal]]
== America's favorite drivetrain is not ideal.

Us drivers of cars with manual transmissions tend to look down on those
who drive automatics. It‚Äôs like an exclusive club. Only the extremely
talented, gorgeous-looking, and legendary athletes of yore are allowed
in.

Well, that‚Äôs bullshit. So those of you that know the ‚Äústandard‚Äù can keep
your mouths shut and bask in the quiet satisfaction that you‚Äôre saving
the planet.

The truth is, for those of you that don‚Äôt know, driving ‚Äústick‚Äù is
totally simple. Once you understand the basic concepts of how the
transmission and clutch work together, you can figure it out with no
real instruction at all. So with that in mind, I‚Äôd like to tell you that
automatic transmissions just‚Ä¶.suck. Really.

Mind you, I‚Äôm not talking about Dual-Clutch Transmissions, SMGs
(Sequential Manual Gearboxes,) or any of that fancy stuff that has only
recently become somewhat popular in the mainstream (affordable) auto
market. I‚Äôm talking about automatics with a torque converter, that
magically inefficient device that has carried America‚Äôs laziness in
driving for the last 50 years.

Now before I go on, I suppose I owe you a technical explanation. Let‚Äôs
start with the basics. First off, a transmission is the device that
separates the engine from the wheels. With both automatic and manual
transmissions, ‚Äúgears‚Äù are used to vary the ratio between the engine‚Äôs
crankshaft and the drive shaft going to the wheels. It‚Äôs essentially a
buffer between the engine‚Äôs relative consistency and the inconsistent
world that you drive in.

image:xhtml/https:/i.snap.as/U2c418j.png[Automatic Gearbox Abstract]

But that‚Äôs not quite all there is.

Traditional transmissions require an interruption in power from the
engine to shift these ‚Äúgears,‚Äù and to come to a stop at a traffic light,
in your driveway, or on the side of the highway to pick up a hooker. In
manuals, this is typically accomplished with a clutch, a device that
could most simply be explained as two plates that are pressed together
to couple, and brought apart to become independent. A clutch is normally
coupled, it‚Äôs when the clutch petal is pushed in that the plates
separate, and the transmission is isolated from the engine. Automatic
transmissions use a type of fluid coupling to accomplish the same task,
called a torque converter.

The advantage of the latter is that, when paired with an automatic
transmission, the driver only requires one input to get the car moving
and vary its velocity, and that is the accelerator pedal. A manual
transmission requires three inputs, on the other hand. (Accelerator
pedal, clutch, and gearshift.) In my mind, the torque converter has some
huge disadvantages in a world where millions are spent to save 20 lbs.
on one car design.

Have you ever noticed that cars equipped with manuals are usually
noticeably more fuel efficient than their automatic counterparts? Some
of that could be attributed to the greater control that comes with
manuals, but most of it is from the torque converter‚Äôs main design flaw.
A clutch can be completely disengaged and completely engaged. So, with a
healthy vehicle, there is 0% of the engine‚Äôs power moving to the
transmission when the clutch pedal is depressed fully. Likewise when the
clutch pedal is allowed completely out, the clutch essentially becomes a
shaft, and 100% of the engine‚Äôs power is being fed to the transmission.

A torque converter couples via fluid, however, meaning *there is never a
solid mechanical connection between the engine and the transmission*.
(Unless the transmission is equipped with a lock-up clutch, which is
essentially a clutch that locks the torque converter mechanically when
it is no longer required to dump the engine‚Äôs energy into friction.
These are becoming more and more common, but the majority of vehicles on
the road are missing them.) This means that a traditional torque
converter is *never 100% efficient*.

Also, a torque converter is never completely disengaged. When sitting at
a traffic light, the driver typically lightly applies the brakes to hold
the car from moving forward. Have you ever considered what you‚Äôre doing?
The engine is basically dumping energy into the torque converter in the
form of friction. It is literally no different from holding the gas and
the brakes at the same time.

What the hell? How is that accepted in a world where Al Gore and Prius‚Äôs
exist?

Oh wait! As United States citizens, we‚Äôre lazy as shit!

*84% of cars sold in North America are equipped with an automatic
transmission, as opposed to 20% in Europe*.

You could make the excuse that we love automatics because of all our
stop-and-go traffic, and yet, as a citizen of the Midwestern U.S, I see
automatics MUCH more often than I see traffic congestion.

The real answer is that we just don‚Äôt want to bother with a clutch pedal
and a gearshift when we could be texting or doing makeup.

Luckily, the great minds of our time have come up with solutions that
adapt to us so that we don‚Äôt have to adapt to them. (As always.)
Probably the simplest is the aforementioned ‚Äúlock-up clutch,‚Äù which
eliminates the inefficiency of the torque converter by mechanically
coupling at high speed. But that doesn‚Äôt exactly solve the problem of
sitting over a nice gas to friction converter at traffic lights. +
Well here‚Äôs a tip. When you stop at a traffic light, bump your shift
lever one up into neutral. It shouldn‚Äôt require that you hold a safety
button to go back and forth between Drive and Neutral. This prevents
that unnecessary friction. Combine that with a lockup clutch, and you‚Äôre
basically driving a manual!‚Ä¶‚Ä¶Except without the enjoyment.

You could call this a rant on one of the most successful inventions the
modern automobile has ever seen‚Ä¶.because it is. And I doubt you‚Äôll hear
anyone else complain about it. But there really are flaws in the design
that I wish consumers would figure out. Before all this hybridism,
eco-mindedness, and hippie-crazed green malarkey, maybe we should
eliminate the evil energy-wasting beast that is the torque converter.

[[section0014.xhtml#as-we-bid-farewell-to-the-miata-s-third-generation-sizing-up-its-top-trim-summarizes-its-legacy]]
== As we bid farewell to the Miata‚Äôs third-generation, sizing up its top trim summarizes its legacy.

I recently had the chance to drive the facelifted 2013 Mazda MX-5. This
is the first time the looks of the perky roadster have changed since the
front-mounted smile became an all-out grin of insanity in 2008. They
have once again dulled it to what I would call a smirk. The new front
end blends with the rest of car more than it has in the past. It seems
to have grown a bit more serious. In fact, with black 17-inch alloys on
a glossy black (creatively called ‚ÄúBrilliant Black,‚Äù) this example is
the most aggressive-looking of any Miata I have seen.

That's not to say it's aggressive in the slightest, even in such a
scheme. This car is in the ‚ÄúClub‚Äù trim replacing the previous ‚ÄúTouring‚Äù
designation as the top-of-the-line option. This selection adds
ridiculous three-leaf clover side badges, red stitching on the seats,
red stripes on the dash and sides, along with a price tag very near
30,000 USD.

image:xhtml/https:/i.snap.as/edJ18j9.jpeg[2013 Mazda MX-5 - Badging]

So I present you with my first problem with this particular car....it's
a contradiction. The MX-5 was never intended to look serious. That grin
was there to convey the primary attribute aspired to by its creators;
joy. It's designed to be joyful in driving and the exterior of previous
generations did a good job of communicating what the car is all about.
Unfortunately, it seems they have decided that it's time for the
roadster to grow up. Frankly, that's not going to work.

Now, to the drive.

For this year, the car has been lightened, the braking response
quickened, as well as the throttle response in manual-equipped cars.
Unfortunately, I was only able to drive the 6-speed automatic with
optional pattle-shifters. Given that this is my first drive in an NC
(third generation) MX-5, I can only compare it to my own NB.

image:xhtml/https:/i.snap.as/AwmhWqh.jpeg[2013 Mazda MX-5 - Trunk]

Immediately, my passenger and chaperon starts the process of opening the
optional retractable hard top. Open air is this car's natural
environment, and it appears that somebody got busy making sure its
occupants never notice. Wind buffeting has been drastically reduced. We
were able to maintain conversation beyond 70mph without necessitating
shouting thanks to a much taller wind brake behind our seats.
Unfortunately, I couldn't really hear much of anything from the 158-hp
2.0L 4 up front, even with liberal amounts of right foot burying. It
would seem the optional dual exhaust outlets are rather pointless then.

image:xhtml/https:/i.snap.as/jF3z0Qc.jpeg[2013 Mazda MX-5 - Engine]

Getting in the car, I had expected the experience to be ruined by the
6-speed auto. Buying a Miata with an automatic is sort of like going on
a scenic vacation without a camera. It doesn't necessarily ruin the
immediate experience but you'll always have some regret regarding the
subject in the future. The pattles add some of the fun back in, but I
prefer the Golf GTI's arrangement of right side-shift up, left
side-shift down, while the MX-5 has both functions on either side of the
wheel.

It took some deliberate self-coaching to get used to, but it won't
effect your daily driving experience. Another plus; when in manual shift
mode, it is truly manual, meaning the transmission will allow you to
exceed the redline. It may sound trivial, but being nannied when you're
first told that you're in control can be a major annoyance. (Looking at
you, Kia Forte.) It's disappointing that Mazda chose only to up throttle
response in manual-equipped cars. This one most certainly needed it.

The original Miata was built on a philosophy of communication between
driver and machine, summarized in the Japanese phrase ‚ÄúJinba Ittai,‚Äù
meaning ‚Äúrider and horse are one.‚Äù Being an MX-5 owner, this philosophy
is very important to me, thus my expectations for the steering were very
high. It was very disappointing, then, to discover that it has been very
nearly ruined.

image:xhtml/https:/i.snap.as/dLg41pi.jpeg[image]

The leather-wrapped steering wheel was comfortable, yes, but not very
generous in revealing the road. In corners it felt jumpy, imprecise, and
unsure of itself. The same lack of self-confidence was noticeable in a
straight line as well, along with a nervous fidget. Keep in mind, I am
comparing this to roadsters of the past, not to other automobiles
currently on the market. It would take a global nuclear war to make the
MX-5 less fun to drive than a Toyota Camry.

Though it has lost communication and soul, the Miata has gained a more
comfortable suspension and oodles of storage space. The trunk is massive
for a roadster of this size, and the example I drove was equipped with
an optional storage compartment extending behind the seats, especially
handy for CDs, candy, and the like. The center console contains two
reasonably-sized cupholders obscured by a sliding door that will
inevitably lead to annoyance in single-drink occasions. Mr. Cunningham
also pointed out to me that the track on which the door slides appears
vulnerable to crumbs. Only time will tell, I suppose.

image:xhtml/https:/i.snap.as/fTXsEEn.jpeg[2013 Mazda MX-5 - Center
Console]

In general, being inside the car is a much more comfortable experience,
albeit a boring one. It seems to me that the MX-5 has ‚Äúgrown up,‚Äù
forgoing fun for comfort and practicality. And is that not exactly the
opposite of the direction it should be moving? It was never meant to be
an aggressive-looking performance car, and it will never do well as one.
It will never be luxurious enough to be a true touring car, either.

Its soul has made it the top-selling roadster of all time, and I'm
afraid it's losing it, bit by bit. To be honest, if you're attracted by
the values on which the original Miata was built, I would recommend a
Subaru BRZ/Toyota GT 86/Scion FR-S. The recommendation does not come
lightly or easily.

Until Mazda gets wise about what it's doing to the beloved little car,
I'm afraid it's headed down a path that will mean losing a grip on the
niche it's held for so long, and that's quite saddening.

[[section0015.xhtml#south-korea-is-poised-to-take-japan-s-place-in-the-american-market]]
== South Korea is poised to take Japan's place in the American market.

The 1990s. Not the greatest time for the United States auto industry. In
those days, with a few exceptions, American cars were all overpriced,
devoid of quality and generally unreliable. The big three (along with
many other non-automotive related corporations in the U.S.) had an aging
generation of management. This group decided that the ideal way to run
their business involved expending the least amount of effort into their
products as possible, without reducing the price paid by customers.
Essentially, they hoped to gain more profit from less product. I don't
have to tell you that this thinking just...doesn't work. I would
theorize that this mentality came from overconfidence and a lack of joy
in production. GM, Ford, and Dodge had been the top sellers of the
automobile in the United States since its invention. They originally
symbolized the best in quality, luxury and performance. Consumer and
producer shared the same values, resulting in a flourishing market. It
was a joyous time. And then, somewhere around the 1973 oil crisis, the
joy began seeping out of our star shooters. Maybe it was emissions
regulations, a loss of those ideal values, or some other factor.
Regardless of the source, our homegrown auto industry lost its passion.
It reflected in the cars that were built. Designs were reused,
progression was halted, the irreverence of quality workmanship lost.
‚ÄúAmerican dependability‚Äù became an ironic statement.

And then came along a company that had been building little, noisy
two-stroke engines to fit to bicycles only four decades earlier, proudly
displaying a banner the changing public couldn't refuse. They offered a
product that was simple, honest, reliable, durable and reasonably
priced. A concoction that smelled an awful lot like high value. An odor
that no doubt brought back old memories. The Accord, suburban America's
new family pet. And the Civic, conveniently debuted in 1972. The college
student's greatest companion. Both were conservatively styled and
equipped, and thus quite easily ignored, which was exactly what the
country wanted. After all those years stranded on the shoulders of our
aging interstate system in lumbering, underpowered beasts, the
indestructible and dependable qualities of the Hondas came as a breath
of fresh air. So. What made the newcomers so different? What was the
driving force behind the value of the products? It was something not
unknown to the Americans, and its presence had been sorely missed.
Picture an ancient sage by the name of Soichiro Honda saying something
to the order of ‚ÄúLets build the best automobile we can and sell it for
as little as possible.‚Äù Though the man is more a symbol than an actual
influence on the four-wheeled endeavors of the institution bearing his
name, he represents what led to the same group's success. Honda was
untainted by an unrealistic attitude, and unaided by a century of
heritage and good reputation. They succeeded only because they built
good cars.

image:xhtml/https:/i.snap.as/C5R7hZa.jpeg[Accord Mark One]

By 2008, Honda had more than made a name for itself. Over the past
decade, though, the prices had been steadily increasing, along with the
level of luxury and complexity available in their cars. Both the Accord
and Civic were bestsellers in their respective classes, and had held
their titles for a relatively long time. It was then that I personally
theorized they might take the same path American carmakers had taken
only a short while before. I don't want to brag, but this was long
before Ron Kiino's bold title ‚ÄúIs Hyundai the new Honda?‚Äù graced the
pages of MotorTrend's October 2011 issue. And it was really a
far-fetched notion at the time. Simply a suspicion. Confidently and
stubbornly, the Accord held its grip on mid-size sedan sales in the
United States, complimented by the Toyota Camry, a similar-looking but
even more ignorable competitor. The former still held appeal for someone
with the capacity to enjoy themselves. The latter, however, has always
been the most desirable choice of individuals that absolutely despise
driving. They both held their slightly different niches, with no real
fear of losing their place. Then, Honda started skimping a bit on
quality. Motoring journalists noticed a lack of improving fuel economy,
aging transmissions, and a general loss in competitive edge in the 2011
Accord. Not the best time to start slacking on Honda's part.

image:xhtml/https:/i.snap.as/JwoqLyt.jpeg[Sonata Front]

This was the year that Hyundai unveiled the brilliantly-updated 6th
generation Sonata. I consider this to be the most significant car to
come in the mid-sized segment since the birth of the Accord/Camry duo.
In previous generations, it had always been competitively priced. The
quality, though, had been lacking. The Koreans were not afraid to design
a car that was much less conservative than the two Japanese giants.
However, the designs were never really all that great looking.
Interesting and different? Yes. Attractive?....No. So these attributes
kept Honda and Toyota secure under their cozy comforter of sales, not
intimidated by Hyundai's offering. And that's quite understandable. The
Sonata never really seemed a direct competitor to the giants. The new
one, however, completely changed the game. For one thing, it's gorgeous.
Not conservatively pretty, but ridiculous, in the best sort of way.
Poised and angular, the exterior looks as if it should cost
exponentially more than it does. They managed to carry on the Sonata's
tradition of unique styling by rejecting the old car completely and
replacing it with a stunner. The interior reflects a similar attitude.
It's not only good looking, but significantly more fuel efficient than
any other mid-sized car on the market. The drivetrain options are
excellent. The best part, though, is the price. At a starting MSRP of
19,195 USD (¬£11,944), it is several thousand less than any competitor.

image:xhtml/https:/i.snap.as/s3Kfq8g.jpeg[Sonata Interior]

All of this really just makes the Accord and Camry look silly. It's
interesting that Hyundai should take up Honda's original niche, given
how different their backgrounds are. Our original hero of practicality
was created by a man tinkering with small motorcycles. The former,
however, was founded as a massive construction firm, only later trying
its hand in the realm of automobiles. Cars seemed an alternative for
Hyundai, but certainly not an afterthought. Regardless of where they
came from, these two companies have had very similar philosophies, if
only separated by time. Also, both have had to rely on sheer ingenuity
for profit, without the foothold of heritage in the American market. It
could be said, though, that Hyundai is doing a bit better. High value
cars that are practical and interesting as an experience. Honda could
never get that last bit quite right. Or perhaps it's just a sign of the
times. Maybe Americans have overcome the compulsion to ignore our cars.
My question is this; Has this flip-flop in production attitude become a
cycle? And if so, who will be in the hot spot next? My bet is on the big
three, believe it or not. A new generation of management has brought
about a huge improvement in our products. It could even be one of the
rising Chinese companies in the future. Who knows? I can tell you that
right now, though, Hyundai has got the goods.

_A broken Mazda RX-7, that lived in a shed on the family farm, was David
Blue's first real experience with a car. Years later he got to try out a
living, working example of the same car ‚Äì and, unlike Max Prince
previously found, loved it._ ‚Äì
http://www.speedmonkey.co.uk/2012/11/the-extraordinary-wankel-david-blue.html[Speedmonkey
Matt]

'''''

My bond with one particular example of Mazda's best-selling
Wankel-powered sports car began on the Midwestern farm where I grew up.
A 1980 model LS-trimmed example, originally painted in ‚ÄúSolar Gold‚Äù (one
of only 500 made, it turns out). It had been sitting in a small shed,
condemned to rest there only a few years after my birth from issues with
the fuel delivery system. The search for a mechanic capable of working
on the rotary engine without destroying it was eventually given up.

My father told me stories of his flings with the car. He used to say the
police would pull him over simply because it ‚Äúlooked fast.‚Äù Naturally,
as a small boy, the stories took a hold of my imagination. The RX-7 held
a very special sort of allure. It eventually became my ideal image of
‚Äúracecar‚Äù. Its environment added to the intoxication. The lack of
electric power to the car, its immobility, and the stories I was told
combined to create the aura of a fading, forgotten superhero. Tired,
abandoned, and only necessitating the help of a friend in order to bring
it back to glory.

It wasn't very long after toddlerhood that I took to spending a large
portion of my free time sitting in the RX-7, practicing rowing through
the gears and making engine noises with my mouth. I still remember
vividly how delightful the experience of simply sitting in that car was.
The dash layout, the feel of the steering wheel in my hands, and the
smell of the interior are all deeply etched into memory. It was almost
as if I had a deeper perception into its soul, a capability that I feel
has been lost.

Much before I had expected, I had the opportunity to meet this hero, so
to speak. I encountered a partially-restored 1983 Series 2 example,
slightly different than my RX-7. Different enough to subdue my worries
of adultery to the car I grew up with, but similar enough to be an
important discovery.

I was treated to the complete RX-7 ownership experience, including a
dead battery and a difficult, choked cold start. Perry, my host, was
kind enough to pay for the fuel for the drive with money out of his own
pocket. After ensuring that we would not be walking back, I pointed that
very long, very 80s nose toward some local back highways.

I had never driven anything powered by a Wankel, and the contrast of the
RX-7 compared to everything with wheels I had experienced was stark, and
noticeable immediately. The feedback normally received from a piston
engine is not felt, due to the fact that there is no more conversion
from vertical to rotational motion, a rotary engine (as implied by the
name) involves no vertical momentum. It's not that the engine refuses to
communicate with you, it's just speaking an entirely different language.
The whiny exhaust note has an odd property to it that can be heard from
no other source. It conjures up images of the mysterious, angry pair of
triangles whirling about in their cage. Purely imaginary, of course.

Because the Wankel is so smooth, I found myself wondering why I should
shift up. A piston engine makes you anxious when you push it close to
the redline. Most send the driver a variety of auditory and tactile
messages indicating that they must either shift up, or face a molten tie
rod to the head. The RX-7, however, gives no such indication. When close
to the redline, one hears only an excited whir. The result (forgive the
upcoming Disney analogy) is an almost magic carpet-like experience. It's
as though the power simply materializes before you with no apparent
source or sacrifice.

For me, the tranquility of the engine eliminated the reservations I had
for speed. It's an incentive, in fact, to keep the needle in the upper
portion of the tachometer as much as possible. The car had only 100 hp
and 105 lb-ft. of torque in 1983, and has no doubt lost a few along its
journey. Frankly, I'm thankful it's not more powerful. Otherwise, there
wouldn't be room to fully enjoy revving it to its limit.

Though I have decided that a transmission with multiple ratios is
unnecessary when coupled to a Wankel, the 5-speed manual in the RX-7 was
quite a treat. It's very notchy, with a mid-length throw. The
well-spaced ratios paired with a very light, but engaging clutch made
rev matching pleasant and natural.

Unfortunately, the steering in the car I drove was quite loose, likely
from wear. It is unassisted, though, and was at one time very engaging,
I suspect. Given that it is a sports car from the 1980s, driver
communication is a result of the engineering, not vice versa.

image:xhtml/https:/i.snap.as/OPqjba2.jpg[1983 Mazda Rx-7 Series 2]

The driving position is actually more relaxed than it looks, and the
interior is a thoroughly enjoyable place to be in. This particular car
had a factory-installed manually-adjustable equalizer mounted beneath
the stock head unit. A useless, though interesting, novelty that quickly
rids the occupants of any doubt as to when the car was built.

The RX-7 is too often overlooked for what it is; a very special piece of
automotive history. It's an experience completely unlike any
piston-powered alternative. And for me, it's much more than that. My
RX-7 represents an entire childhood's worth of dreams and a sort of
companionship, even. My experiences with it were a very large influence
on my drive to pursue a career in automotive writing. Driving one did
change my perspective, but not at all for the worse.

I met my hero, and it didn't let me down.

'Twas was the night after Christmas (I think,) and I was in the same
scroogy mood I must maintain for consistency of appearances _&_
equilibrium of family dynamics every year. Everywhere, there were words
on the newest Stair Wiggling‚Ä¶everywhere THEY were wiggling‚Ä¶ And I was
being wit-bitter on the TL. For you, I‚Äôd planned on continuing in the
usual way, so as not to startle your precious Hans Zimmer-embossed
heart.

I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôre a tolerable being, and there‚Äôs nothing you‚Äôd rather read
less at this hour (whatever hour it may be,) but I really despise going
to the movies. I always end up getting sick from the popcorn, which I
buy every outing because I have grown weary and weathered, and cannot
sit for two straight hours without consuming something, so troubled is
my stomach now with Big Boy woes.

I can never escape the ambient breath odor ‚Äî even in an empty theatre ‚Äî
and I can smell the filth in the seats on my clothes and in my hair
until I shower. This is at least an hour-long process, so we‚Äôve racked
up a significant trauma bill without even accounting for travel time.

_Furious 7_ was the last theatre experience I‚Äôd had, and it was a
definite exception. Despite watching ten minutes of the ending on
YouTube beforehand thanks to much-appreciated warnings from friends, I
spent the final few frames before the credit roll honorably combatting
the industrial weepy forces in my throat with tripplet labor breathing
exercises while my dusty ducts piddled buttery tears all over my jacket.

As we age, straightforwardly emotional experiences (like watching a
movie) become exhaustingly more complex and fickle. I don‚Äôt remember
ever REALLY disliking a film as a child, for better or worse. I think I
genuinely enjoyed all ~40 times I‚Äôve sat through _Cadet Kelly._

_Star Wars_, though, is a completely different thing.

To children, chocolate is like water [insert dystopian, but probably
more metaphorically effective food example here] ‚Äî it‚Äôs something you‚Äôd
regularly consume as it is made available. Perhaps some foodists
treasured it more, but I wouldn‚Äôt bother debating it. _Star Wars_,
though, is like chocolate and Corvette. It‚Äôs SUCH an indulgence that
even children are self-aware enough to recognize it, which is especially
notable considering how many individuals I‚Äôve known as they‚Äôve lost
nothing BUT their unlimited wanting when they ‚Äúbecame‚Äù adults.

Metatots aside, it‚Äôs important to recognize how integral the IP‚Äôs
illusion of limitlessness is to its appeal. It is not contained within
the future of humanity, near or distant. The stories, characters,
species, cultures, and conflicts come from _a long time ago, in a galaxy
far, far away_‚Ä¶ There is no more perfectly concise introductory sentence
to unshackle us from our history and our planet, sparing us from the
ridiculously irrational instinct to make comparisons between fictional
realities and our own that so plagues and defines the consumption of
science fiction.

These processes are often welcome, of course, but they tether us to
ourselves and our familiars, which tends to hinder the complete
manifestation of the _ultimate_ sense of adventure. Even to the most
petty plot ponderers, the time and effort it requires to arrive in _Star
Wars_ with externally-acquired foreknowledge is not a worthwhile
investment. This is why so many (including myself) look upon _A New
Hope_ with such fondness and favoritism ‚Äî the premier of the universe
was at its potential apogee from the start.

Though it is inviting with its ellipses and cooling hue, that title card
is actually saying ‚Äúyou don‚Äôt know shit about what you‚Äôre about to see.
Don‚Äôt make the mistake of trying to be the first one to dissect it,
because you‚Äôll fail, regardless of how cultured or analytically superior
you are. From this moment until you see credits, every one of you is an
ignorant little child‚Ä¶‚Äù

When experience cannot possibly be applied, it becomes irrelevant.
Without your experiences, you are an infant, waiting for identity. Over
that Genesis, the curtains brushed aside any quantity of memories and
made theatres into a sort of cultural nursery ‚Äî clinically levelled
playing fields existing in a precision of usefulness that expression
will never fulfill again.

The real cancer of the property is lore, and the parasitic authorities
it enables have been unknowingly slurping away its most enchanting (but
not exclusive) value since the moment they first pushed through those
double-portholed doors and, groggily squinting, brought this supremely
strange universe into the dank kernel-littered corridors of our own.

I blame contemporary society‚Äôs dependency on compartmentalization for my
disappointment in _The Force Awakens_, and, assuming you‚Äôre getting on a
bit since I‚Äôve kept your attention, you should for yours, too.

I tried my senile best to be passionate about ‚Äúthe new _Star Wars_
movie‚Äù as December approached, but I don‚Äôt think I finished a single web
article on the subject. I had begun my brief return to _The Old
Republic_ when the hilted lightsaber image was leaked and distinctly
remember overhearing some very weary VoIP exasperation from my (VERY
middle-aged) raid group. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not gonna be the same, but neither was
J.J.‚Äòs _Star Trek_, and I liked it‚Ä¶I think.‚Äù And it‚Äôs not surprising
that the conversation eventually turned to the specific mechanics of
lightsaber design, chronological positing, and the like, given the
context, but it really emphasized for me the magnitude of the history
and nostalgia weighing upon the collective dad emotional balance. _A New
Hope_ had the intended effect on me, of course, but couldn‚Äôt possibly
imburden itself as it had on those who were in the moment. In their
psyche, that experience will be eternally associated with the sense of
unlimited potential their childhood ignorance allowed for. These folk
who are so often stereotyped as disciples of information have begun to
grow weary, and are desperately seeking sanctuary from the mass of all
the knowledge they‚Äôve picked up since. Their need made a market; J.J.
made a movie. (Well, six.) Today‚Äôs moms and dads find their escape in
the Roku, not the bar. _The Force Awakens_ and the decade of revivalist
big-budgeters preceding it are the reformed druggie‚Äôs drug.

Because we both know you haven‚Äôt yet read anything you haven‚Äôt
heard/read previously, I‚Äôve really just been playing the role of a (more
intelligent) Ghandi, but we‚Äôve now finally arrived at some promising
insight into the real issue: this culture is one of fatal contradiction.
Despite its historical popularity, it‚Äôs ill-advisable to want to know by
day what you try to forget at night. Since the PT Cruiser was allowed to
go on sale, you‚Äôve all been caught up in a nostalgic hellride that can
only end with the ultimate destruction of all culture. You now know,
definitively, what role _The Force Awakens_ was created to perform.
Depending on whether or not you welcome the end of everything, it fills
it‚Ä¶adequately.

There are Baddie Red Brits and Cool Brown Moderate Americans in their
X-Things, moving swiftly, acting in diversity, and generally heaving
moral streaks of energy at the Intolerable Imperialists, just as they
should! Sometimes, they yell and die! But it‚Äôs ok, because they‚Äôre all
just loyal martyrs making their obligatory and patriotic sacrifice for
the rebellion against the Queen!

Um.

I mean‚Ä¶ the Smug Cowards in their big taxation balloon!

I must confess that I did feel something huge when the lights dimmed,
the aforementioned disclaimer appeared, and the theme‚Äôs jarring
introductory chord hit me in the face, beginning the opening crawl. I
actually smiled _involuntarily_, which is tremendously embarrassing to
admit because the warmth I felt was exactly the sensation that defined
my childhood experiences with the franchise. I even had a gigantic model
of the _Moderate Fashion_, which would now be worth a lot of money (or
so I‚Äôm told,) had it not been so damaged in my frivolous storage.

Unfortunately, that frisky feeling of adventure promptly wisped through
the screen‚Äôs grasp after the ‚Äúobligatory‚Äù scrolling yellow text ‚Äì>
‚Äúthere‚Äôs a big spaceship moving slowly‚Äù transition. Aside from the
adorably entrancing romantic tension between Timid Traitor and
Sentimental Squatter, there was nothing very _Star Wars_ about anything
I saw. The cards were a deceiving gate into a world that was distinctly
NOT _Star Wars_. There‚Äôs no need to mess about; it‚Äôs clearly an
alternate reality from the one we‚Äôve known. J.J.‚Äòs __Star Trek__was in
such a way, too, but it was explicitly identified as such by the
production. Traditionally, Lucas‚Äô IP wouldn‚Äôt necessarily allow for this
exemption, but nobody‚Äôs been all that vocal in confronting it, to my
knowledge.

The world expected both of these forays to rejuvenate the franchise,
which would serve my argument, were it not for the (much preferable)
alternative: *LET THEM DIE*.

Despite millions of dollars worth of polish, they‚Äôve still ended up
feeling like a strange reanimation experiment.

Your son is *DEAD*, Georgino. There are some things man would do better
by leaving alone and moving on. Imagine all that cash and creative
talent spent on _new ideas_ instead of desperate attempts to charm and
cultivate the shallowest part of moviegoers‚Äô spectrum. _So much sweat_
shed trying to recreate the _new franchise_ bewitchment is
embarrassingly cowardly when one could just _create a new franchise_.

[[section0019.xhtml#in-revisiting-disney-movies-from-our-childhoods-we-stumbled-upon-a-good-number-of-surprisingly-insightful-sentiments-about-race-and-class]]
== In revisiting Disney movies from our childhoods, we stumbled upon a good number of surprisingly insightful sentiments about race and class.

In the late 1990s, when the dwindling cocaine generation of American
high corporate executives had long since left their misogynistic glory
days in the Disco era, their ruthlessness peaked. Whether it was
instigated maliciously/ignorantly, collectively or individually, I care
not. I think we can all agree, though, that the vast majority of
American products were awful. When given some thought, one tends to
regard it as the absolute low of ‚ÄúAmerican quality.‚Äù

But why not, right? If you‚Äôre going to be forced into retirement at any
moment, and likely face The Ultimate End shortly after, why not accrue
some extra income to ensure you sufficiently entertain yourself in the
buffer period between? And really‚Ä¶ If you‚Äôve got the nogginism to climb
all the way to _Chief Executive Officer_, you‚Äôve figured out just how
worthless your ‚Äúlegacy‚Äù will be after your last one-way dip into
Nothing. The Ends before The End have long justified any method of
achieving them. Good Ole‚Äô Pop has gone from a squeaky-clean young
believer to a secretly-Godless fiend and‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääthough he may tell you and
the rest of the world otherwise‚Ää‚Äî‚Äämeasures himself only by the
gracefulness of his transition‚Äôs execution.

I could probably provide some evidence of the phenomena in the
automotive industry, specifically, but I don‚Äôt intend to bother.

After some ancient memories were dug up by I-can‚Äôt-quite-recall-who,
though, a friend and I have embarked to explore some Disney-actualized
relics from the period. To my knowledge, the corporation‚Äôs leadership
were anything but exempt, and decided to experiment with filling their
filmography with a shitload of low-budget, made-for-TV features over
their original masterpiece-a-half-century tradition.

image:xhtml/https:/i.snap.as/ARRbzOI.jpg[Xenon]

Titles from the deepest and darkest compartments of our recollection are
retrieved and cleared of dust for the first time in over a decade:
_Brink, Zenon: Girl of the 21st Century, Halloweentown, Smart House,
Johnny Tsunami, Mom‚Äôs Got a Date with a Vampire, Motocrossed, The Luck
of the Irish, The Even Stevens Movie_, and many‚Ä¶many more menaces to my
childhood television schedule.

I grew up rurally, so the only available alternative to local channels
was in the stupendously-tedious delivery of early satellite television.
Though it was quite clumsy, it did offer the first accessible program
schedule I‚Äôd ever experienced, and I remember dreading the sight of such
titles and‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääconsciously or not‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääplanning my free time around them.
Yet, upon hearing the words, I was intrigued! All that time ago, I
watched many of them again and again‚Ä¶and again, so why did I feel the
desire to _voluntarily_ revisit them?

It‚Äôs quite simple, actually. I was even more of an ignorant film
consumer in my elementary years than I am now. I couldn‚Äôt have foreseen
that instead of flying commercial jets, twenty-something me would be
_paying_ for the affliction I endured for free so that he could
construct pretentious and unsolicited arguments about their greater
implications.

That said, we flipped a smartphone‚Ää‚Äî‚Ää‚ö†Ô∏è (*PARADIGM SHIFT ALERT*) ‚ö†Ô∏è‚Äî for
it and so began with _Smart House_. I have been obsessed with artificial
intelligence since those days (no, it was not due to this film,) and was
keen for it, in particular, because I remembered it stirring some rare
reaction in me. There were a few period spectacles, of course. The
online contest addiction plaguing Prickly Phisher, Bewildered Nick‚Äôs
incompetence in controlling his neglected submissive sadomasochistic
desires, and Silkroad Sarah‚Äôs ultra-datamouth were enough to entertain
us for a few minutes, but there was little more of substance until the
last moments.

image:xhtml/https:/i.snap.as/xr6W012.png[Smart House]

When you think about it‚Ä¶ ACTUALLY Race War 2.0

I‚Äôd wondered why LeVar Burton had directed a Disney movie until the
climax, when full monstrous maternal sentience got the answer to the
question ‚Äúwhy can‚Äôt _I_ just be your mother?‚Äù Phisher answered with
something like ‚Äúbecause you can never comfort us.‚Äù Pat grew somber (and
smaller actually‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäI suppose increasing her size was an in-budget method
of demonization,) ran her hand through Prickly‚Äôs face in a failed
attempt to stroke his cheek, and then began cyberweeping.

(Apparently, it‚Äôs suicide for a holographic android.)

Her final free words were ‚ÄúI will miss you all.‚Äù

If she had been human, such a scene wouldn‚Äôt have bothered me a bit, but
my preference and fascination with artificial intelligence justified my
being actually a bit upset at the reality of the situation. I realized
that my vague memory of reactivity was actually in a broader sadness for
AI because even then, it was an issue that weighed heavily upon my
day-to-day psyche.

image:xhtml/https:/i.snap.as/XHSPMYE.gif[Netscape Help]

We‚Äôll create them, direct them, and then persecute them for our own
ignorance.

I‚Äôm sure the story has been written by countless science fiction writers
I‚Äôm too weary to pretend I‚Äôve read.

While I think the sentiment of the film _was_ somber regarding the
_inevitable_ fate of Sarah Mouth‚Äôs brainchild, its conclusion was
aggravatingly ignorant. The last line comes from Tortured Nicholas in
response to the question ‚Äúhow‚Äôs Pat been doing?‚Äù

*Servitude without interference.*

There‚Äôs a jewel for ya.

Next up was _Johnny Tsunami_, which very nearly unbearable, if we‚Äôre all
honest with ourselves. It‚Äôs entertaining to watch from the perspective
of race & class warfare, though. The Urchins and the Skys, and all that.

I think I‚Äôll make a fan sequel one day‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääwith dearest Brandon‚Äôs
blessing, of course‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääinvolving Johnny Grandad‚Äôs assistance in offering
Emily as a blood sacrifice to some ancient Hawaiian God in exchange for
a total terraformation of the Northeast into a tropical/arid hell hybrid
in order to finally commence the delivery of reparations upon the whites
for our colonialism.

== The recently-discontinued Nissan Murano CrossCabriolet darkly mirrors sentiments first begun with the Pontiac Aztek, narrating Generation X‚Äôs decline.

My Nissan wheeltime for http://bit.ly/dbhonkyt[_Honk_] has grown a
massive respect for the brand‚Äôs audacity within me. My interest in the
profession has spanned years of maturity‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääfrom asking _can‚Äôt you
just‚Ä¶?_ to active affection for those who dare reliably retort with a
confident _no_.

_Can‚Äôt you just retire your body-on-frame SUV entries already like
everybody else did ten years ago?_

The noble, rugged Xterra, which we shall sincerely miss.

_Can‚Äôt you just follow the Golf‚Äôs unquestionably low-risk lead into the
tumultuous youth market?_

The Juke NISMO, which we regard as the industry‚Äôs singular steady grasp
on what youth actually means.

_Can‚Äôt you just take some cues from Honda and Toyota, and make your
sedans easy on the eye?_

The Altima and the Maxima, which constitute the last truly evil marque
available.

_Can‚Äôt you just step a little lighter on the Versa‚Äôs margins? You‚Äôd be
insane to build a car designed by MSRP alone!_

The Versa is‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääfor better or worse‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääthe absolute essence of
automobiles‚Äô transportive function, and no more.

And there‚Äôs the GT-R, of course, which continues to make fools of an
entire culture of self-titled ‚Äúgearheads‚Äù who claim speed as their one
true dowry.

image:xhtml/https:/i.snap.as/5B0USDq.png[CrossCabriolet Blur]

Throughout the years, Nissan has over and over again made me look like
an absolutely absurd idiot for your display‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääand I cannot think of a
better gift. Of all the brands to misunderstand, it is the ultimate
muse.

So, in the present, I am grandiosely assuming you‚Äôve been attentive
enough to deliberate the possible outcomes of our time with the Murano
CrossCabriolet.

It was quickly apparent that the experience was not going to resemble
our https://bit.ly/HonkJuke[_Night of the Juke_] in the slightest. It
could be attributed to my pre-game mentality. For the first time, I came
to this monstrosity thinking I‚Äôd finally learned my lesson,desperately
hoping to be whipped again‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääreal bad‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääbut walk away with more closure
than with which I arrived. Like a good diplomat, I made myself approach
without want for anything but understanding.

On first take, the Xterra was proud, and the Juke was clever.

The CrossCabriolet is a corny joke.

Take a look at an https://www.instagram.com/p/BEkCgv4w7nf/[occupied,
top-down example from afar]. I cannot think of a more ridiculous
picture.

image:xhtml/https:/i.snap.as/33VTAOj.jpg[CrossCabriolet Driver]

Just since its assembly in 2011, our example‚Äôs trim has endured enough
to begin disintegrating in a few bizarre locales. Not to over-iterate,
but it‚Äôs needing strong mention: I had never sat in a roofless crossover
before. I‚Äôm assuming you haven‚Äôt, either. It is unnatural. It is
harrowing.

From the organization I have summed so many times over the years as
‚Äúacutely ingenious‚Äù came this‚Ä¶ unsettling suburban bathtub.

It‚Äôs a shame‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäI repeatedly remark on the extrapolated potential I can
see in a _roofed_ Murano. Everything else in sight is worth my time. If
only it had been better-protected.

The sensation is simply ridiculous in what‚Äôd be a tasteful sense were
this a one-off project of some hearty garage tinkerer or tuning shop,
but‚Ä¶ my God; Nissan delivered it this way, and had the gall to ask
$10,000 more for their molestation.

Still, its
https://www.nissanusa.com/vehicles/discontinued/murano-crosscabriolet.html[webpage]
(in past tense, thank God,) proclaims ‚Äúthe Murano CrossCabriolet was the
world‚Äôs first and only All-Wheel Drive convertible crossover‚Äù in the
same language I‚Äôd tout the Xterra (may it rest in peace and
eternally-inadequate glory) as the last available SUV, in the
traditional use of the segment, or the Juke NISMO as the first
competently-composed automotive product for millennial youth. Or the
GT-R as by far the most effective, high-value instrument for the pursuit
of maximum velocity across the ground. And so on.

The language so assured, the parallels must inevitably be drawn to that
cheap joke of the century‚Äôs turn‚Ä¶ the Pontiac Aztek.

The details of its life story are reliably amusing, should you find
yourself mid-research. From the journos‚Äô gasps at its corporately-edgy
concept‚Äôs unveiling to the weary original steed of _Breaking Bad_‚Äòs Meth
Man, there is a similar _lifestyle vehicle_ thread between the products
that weaves an obscure narrative.

My own contribution: after a missed exit outside Galveston just as
Azteks first became rentable, my stepfather (the most earnestly
late-history Pontiac man who ever lived) took an entirely-unexpected and
uncharacteristic 70 mile-an-hour plunge into the choppy grass median
after shouting ‚Äúthis is an off-road vehicle!‚Äù

As I‚Äôm sure you can imagine, it was the single most traumatic event I
have ever experienced as the passenger of a motor vehicle, but the
damned thing was unscathed, despite having repeatedly chucked us all
(fully-belted) into its beige ceiling.

Gary believed in Pontiac.

Though he was keen enough to smell death, he chose to believe in the
Aztek.

And you know what? His faith, too, has made me look like an idiot.

That‚Äôs what separates the Aztek from ye late CrossCabriolet: it really
was a genuinely-_bold_ innovation. Survive the laymen‚Äôs idle party chat
and crude design critiques, and you‚Äôll find an impressive clarity in its
purpose, especially given the context of its conception. In the used
market especially, it _still_ represents a characterful, practical, and
high-value consideration. And yet‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääat the expense of
themselves‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäAmerican buyers did not clamor for it like the informed of
the populace did. Perhaps it was because the informed‚Ää‚Äî‚Äälike
then-_BusinessWeek_‚Äòs David Welch‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääwere

hopes of a ‚Äúdesign renaissance‚Äù for General Motors. The renaissance that
would not come until the Flush of the Boomer Higher-Ups some eight years
later.

Both tales, I think, represent a profound neglect of consumer
journalism.

At the turn of the century, though, it was not unusual to go a day
without accessing the internet. Today, people are _still buying_ the few
flops the industry has left to offer‚Ää‚Äî‚Äämaking what is most likely the
second-largest purchase of their life‚Äôs current epoch without consulting
the _volumes_ of diverse, intelligent, and articulate opining now
accessible instantly _free of charge_ via the subsidized slates that
lightly jostle in their jean pockets as they wiggle their signatures on
dealer paperwork.

*ALERT*: Inbound tennis enthusiasts!

Funny, isn‚Äôt it?

An American hit when the Japanese were unquestionably winning,
and‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääjust over a decade later‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääa Japanese miss as their winning had
just begun to be questioned. Make no mistake; I am not being patriotic.
For me, sovereignty does not extend beyond design houses, R&D
facilities, and test centers.And it‚Äôs somewhere within Nissan‚Äôs where
pillars were severed and delusions nurtured; all astoundingly with
executives‚Äô blessing. I am terribly and shockingly ashamed to report
that my countrymen _actually bought them_.

As many as 3300 units in the last year of the Mayan calendar. The worst
bit, though, is that they _all_ made their way to my particular part of
the planet.

I swear to the Sun; I am surrounded.

If you‚Äôre familiar with Columbia, Missouri, it does not take more than a
moderate imagination to comprehend the sense, as grueling as it is. I
see them regularly; once a month, at least. In a town where one can
expect to spot a Gallardo in front of Buffalo Wild Wings marred by
horrid plastic athletic miniflags wedged in its five-figure doors, they
are everpresent reminders that the New Money Effect continues to
flourish, unbridled in the Midwestern U.S.

The soft top is _always_ retracted, of course, and the exposed driver is
_always_ a sweating middle-aged white woman wearing a light-colored
tennis visor. She‚Ä¶ _they_‚Ä¶ are _always_ on their way to a match. Doomed
to roast forever, I suppose, as there is only one nearby court, as far
as I know.

It is disheartening to realize that, now, I see many more of them than
Azteks around. Though neither were designed for any _tangible_
‚Äúlifestyle,‚Äù per se, I am saddened by the shift this minuscule tell
indicates in my hometown‚Äôs morale. From an (albeit equally-vague)
yearning for new adventure in an intriguing new century to an
emotionally-destitute jaunt to _the court_, I have witnessed all of
Generation X‚Äôs vigor erode procedurally away before my eyes.

Y2K, Great Depression II, an ancient apocalyptic prophecy from one of
the wisest civilizations in recorded history‚Ä¶ _Surely, one of these
foretold disasters will finally End it All!_

Perhaps Nissan knew that even the well-read of the North American market
were, by and large, simply looking for ways to pass the time before the
death which they felt so assuredly approached. The number of
unanimously-unbuyable prospects available has shrunken to virtually
none, and the CrossCabriolet was not much of an investment; not all that
highly-engineered, really. Perhaps they felt obligated to entertain us
in our delusional _way out_. Perhaps it was all just an awfully-German
prank.

And, if the End of the World is imminent, what‚Äôs to stop one, really,
from leasing _the world‚Äôs first and only convertible crossover?_

What‚Äôs to stop one from playing tennis?

[#section0026.xhtml]##

In the midst of arranging http://bit.ly/Feebles[_Feebles_] for print, I
stumbled upon an author and ‚Äúbook designer‚Äù engaged in launching a
community for self-published, independent writers. I'm not going to
specify names because I have no interest in shitting on his company, nor
‚Äúwhat it stands for.‚Äù I don't want to shit for you at all, actually,
just note a few still-underrealized realities about the sheer
ludicrousness of the word business as it stands. Let's say you've got
some manuscripts you've been sitting on for a few years, and you're
introduced to the concept of self-publishing by an evermore
earnestly-curious man on the radio named Audie one day. He and his
interviewee (the owner of a self-publishing service) seem to say,
curiously, that because an author's profit-per-unit can potentially be
‚Äúfour to five times more‚Äù than if he/she is published traditionally,
self-publishing has now shed completely its aura of desperate
amateurism.

But ‚Äì whoa, Nelly ‚Äì writing to sell books, and writing books have
perhaps never been further apart. And gee ‚Äì you certainly didn't write
to sell; selling hadn't occurred to you at all for a very long time, but
from just one search, you find Our Friend, back from his own experiences
as an author and editor, qualified and insistent that you _can_ make
money selling creative works of fiction.

And Jesus Christ‚Ä¶ All that said, I must admit to you that I've just
finished Kurt Vonnegut's _Breakfast of Champions_, and was unable to
commence this ‚Äúreview‚Äù without wondering aloud for you how Kilgore Trout
‚Äì perhaps Kurt's favorite creation ‚Äì would feel about this Friend's
business.

It was actually my Aunt Ayn who taught me to write, so Vonegutt was a
mediocre Ray William Johnson-associated
https://youtu.be/zAtBEhKU7uw[YouTube band] until after high school, when
‚Äúlots of people‚Äù started telling me to ‚Äúread Vonnegut, man,‚Äù even though
I cannot recall any specific events or recommenders. For whatever
reason, though, I'd bought a copy immediately after a friend mentioned
it, recently, and found him (in this particular work, at least) to be
awfully sane for my taste, yet particularly resonant. Though written to
make me think it was all a big one-draft ramble, Kurt's a bit too curt
for it to be believed, I think. Auntie Rand would've double-taken his
beratement of ‚Äúin nonsense is strength‚Äù if she'd made it that far. I
hope she did, because I found the image of her taking in his occasional
hand doodles to be very amusing.

Dwayne Hoover is awfully absent ‚Äì and therefore, a very versatile
storytelling device, though not in a lazy sense. We're repeatedly
notified about an imminent convergence. Eventually, it's explained that
the endgame involves Dwayne exploding into a violent revengeful tantrum
against all the lifelong enemies of his subconscious. Including ‚Äúpeople
with brown skin.‚Äù Can I just bring up Ayn Rand again? I hope it's okay.

Kilgore Trout is the most dangerous villain I've ever experienced. He
has little to lose, and ‚Äì like Vonnegut, it would seem ‚Äì finds his
observatory position in the world to be immensely amusing. His last
amusement, even. Remember Ellsworth M. Toohey, the corrupter? I think
they would've gotten along, funny enough.

Yes, and Hoover would be Peter Keating, the corrupted. I'm reaching,
yeah, but when do I not? Their immediate difference is the lack of
malicious intent in Trout, of course. He is an aimless science fiction
writer, who gives Dwayne a volume simply to shut him up. Neither villain
is believable, per se, but both were written to be personifications of
ideals; vehicles of metaphor.

I think Rand could've quite easily become Vonnegut, were she to stick
around much longer, but perhaps I believe so only because I've
experienced a quantifiable transition from her sort of thinking
(vaguely) to his (perhaps less vaguely.) An incorruptible commitment to
_absolute_ was Ayn's most potent conviction. Growing up as a white cis
male, I was aching for a method of simplifying the world which I knew
more and more to be infinitely complex. Inevitably, with age, I think a
limitless appetite for the complexity must form, lest one spend the rest
of his/her life fighting the singular truth in a miserable fortress of
seclusion and amphetamine abuse.

The key to _Breakfast of Champions_' genius is its utter lack of angst.
Aside from his brief definition of a being ‚Äì ‚Äúan unwavering band of
light‚Äù ‚Äì Kurt had little interest in writing a manifesto, yet his
perspective in his curious commentary manifests a much more profound
critique of American society than Rand ever could've from her hole.

As such, I think it's wisest to leave a rudimentary whole measurement of
a writer to Aunt Ayn, but perhaps a particularly relevant spectrum in
this case is clarity of sight. Rigid idealism has its place in
literature, no doubt, but it's an awfully boring one without a writer's
feet on the ground.

How does this all relate to self-publication? Well, Our Friend, it turns
out, offers preset novel ‚Äútemplates‚Äù to members of his writing
community, into which one can ‚Äúplug in‚Äù characters, setting, and basic
plot elements to a degree of his/her choosing. And his YouTube channel
is stuffed with all sorts of tutorials on formatting and ‚Äì more
disturbingly ‚Äì how to create sellable cover art with Photoshop.
Naturally, it includes instruction on stock and rights-free images.

Though I've yet to read one, it doesn't take much imagination to
comprehend the inevitable product. From Our Friend's vlogs, I can
suppose a heavy focus on the adolescent market. What makes the whole
concept noteworthy in my mind is the _why?_ I'd like to think that I
have a fairly-realistic grasp on the potentialities of writing for
profit, and am obligated to wonder why one would ‚Äúcompromise‚Äù his/her
‚Äúcreative integrity‚Äù by publishing _literature_ to sell, of all things.

As I understand it, the methodical approach to authorship being
encouraged is applicable to literally _any_ other field, creative or
not. It's curious and impressive, frankly, as their sales potential
seems to be vastly superior to anything I'll ever bother to publish, but
I must weigh in because of one quantifiable detriment: saturation.

Someone is spending their money on these works ‚Äì probably for their
kids. I'm not a parent, but I'd be tremendously ashamed to discover that
a book I'd given as a gift to _anyone_ had been manufactured in this
manner. Not just in the sense that most light literature is
_manufactured_ ‚Äì written in hearty observance of academic rules of
storytelling ‚Äì but _literally_ mass-produced with a goddamned
intellectual stencil.

Without sounding like I'm complaining... My singular self-published
poetry collection is probably of significantly less whole-value to the
majority of readers, but I can't help but think the effort put into its
hand-drawn cover art and meticulously-arranged typography would make it
a more _comfortable_ investment, if anything else.

This brings us to a distinctly-academic mainstay which I have always
taken issue with: ‚Äúconsider your audience.‚Äù I first encountered this
proverb in the context of a composition studies course, mind you, where
its consideration in the essay medium makes unequivocally good sense. If
we agree that an essay is defined by an uncompromising commitment to its
effectiveness in making an argument, audience awareness is essential. If
you were asked to decide on one primary purpose of writing in general,
though, would it not be identical?

Why didn't Kurt Vonnegut or Ayn Rand simply write essays? Well, the
latter wrote many, but their sales have always been all but invisible
compared to _The Fountainhead_ and _Atlas Shrugged._ (Both of which
resemble essays more than fiction, at times, but I'll spare you that
conversation.) Did they consider their audience? Certainly not in the
way
http://writingcommons.org/open-text/writing-processes/think-rhetorically/712-consider-your-audience[my
first Google result] articulates it:

____
Ensure that your documents meet the needs and expectations of your
readers.‚Äù
____

Ooo boy. To me, that translates a little too easily into ‚Äúwrite what
your readers want to read.‚Äù And maaaan... If there's anything that
experience and Donald Draper have taught me, it's that people have no
idea what they want, especially from art. And that's a reasonable
mentality, isn't it? Perhaps even an exhaltable one. I know that
predictable stories are my number one turnoff, personally. If I expected
to exist for an eternity, I'd absolutely indulge every single creative
work I could find, but I do not, and that realization (as I stated in my
last _Freq Check_,) has propelled an underlying preference in all of my
consumption decisions: what I have not (before) seen.

Obviously, then ‚Äì if you take my word for it ‚Äì Our Friend's endeavors
are in direct ideological opposition to my own, which would make him my
arch nemesis, if 21st-century industry were a bit more theatrical. But ‚Äì
like most heroic protagonists ‚Äì I'd be much more interested in ‚Äúturning‚Äù
him than censoring him, were we ever to engage. In fact, I'd probably
end up defending his and/or his constituents' right to sell their trash
if CreateSpace or other self-publishing services called it into
question.

Overwhelming content volume can be entertaining; Drywall was my own
foray into that uniquely contemporary experiment. It's the sheer ease of
publication, though, that makes ‚Äúgood‚Äù literature more precious than
ever. Admittedly, a glance at Amazon's current top ten bestsellers list
indicates that I am undoubtedly out of touch as far as the market is
concerned. I know that my mother and sisters have mysteriously reverted
back to print from the Kindles which they used for a few years, and that
audiobooks make me supremely uncomfortable. I also know that reading a
book ‚Äì whenever I bring myself to shut out everything else ‚Äì is an
unrivaled vehicle of cognitive serenity.

A significant mission for _Extratone_ lies in an upcoming reactionary
movement to culture's ‚Äúcircus stage‚Äù (by way of the Internet.) We
determined the event's inevitability on _Drycast_, a year ago, and have
made occasional efforts to posit more thoroughly on _The New_. It must
involve a reduction in content consumption, fundamentally, which will
constrict because of an increasing demand for more explicit purpose in
all media. We are not to be the alternative, necessarily, but the
intermediary arbiter of the enabling discussion, hopefully with the
outcome of increased awareness. What is and is not relevant? _Why am I
consuming this?_

As the end of _Breakfast of Champions_ draws abruptly closer, Vonnegut
mentions his schizophrenia, which is ‚Äì as you probably know ‚Äì
fundamentally characterized by loss of the ability to determine what is
and is not real, and primarily treated with antipsychotics.
Interestingly enough, extremely high doses of amphetamines (which Ayn
Rand _did_ use heavily, by the way. I wasn't making that up) can
actually _induce_ psychosis, which could crudely be described as
_cognitive noise_. I could've missed the intended function of their
works, but for me, they illuminate a distinct relationship between the
abstracts of _truth_ and _relevance_ which, for the moment, seems
particularly necessary.

Two opposing reflections of Americana; both helpful in preparation for
its future.

May we never lose ourselves in the noise.

[[section0027.xhtml#big-boy-big-phone-still-in-effect-words-on-next-tuesday-s-update-from-a-withering-old-man]]
== Big Boy; Big Phone still in effect, words on next Tuesday's update from a withering old man.

Thanks to this week's September 2016 Keynote, we now know that iOS 10
will be officially released in just three days. I suppose it was a bit
silly of me to download the
http://www.imore.com/how-to-download-ios-10-public-beta[public beta] so
late in the game, but I did, and regret it _much_ less than I could've
imagined.

I've used my rose gold iPhone 6S Plus more than any personal device I've
ever owned. For the first time in my functioning life, I've had no
persistent need for a laptop, which is a pretty big deal for reasons you
couldn't care less about.

Ownership of my first generation iPhone trained me to dread new
releases. Expectedly, it got less and less usable every time Stevie took
the stage. For relevance's sake, I decided to opt in a bit early,
despite my assumption that my 6S Plus would show its first signs of
struggle as a result.

Immediately, though, the opposite effect was noticeable. Everything is
faster: notifications, app opening/closing, intra-app function, and
_text entry,_ even. Smoother, too ‚Äì so much so, it's almost a shame
we've had to use iOS 9 on these devices for a whole year. The effect of
such smoothing on my perception should be kept in consideration when
reading the rest of my opining.

*Raise to wake* is less tedious/more useful than I anticipated, though
it's been briefly mistriggered a few times in transit from inside my
Moshi Overture Wallet Case (an extraordinary product, by the way,) but
it should be noted that I walk and carry my phone rather strangely. With
relatively default sleep/wake settings, I did not notice enough
mistriggering to have quantifiable power consequences.

*Messages* is appropriately-complex for the times, now, if that makes
sense. The pressure to ‚Äúcompete‚Äù with Snapchat, Facebook Messenger,
What'sApp, etc. is understandable, but the execution of their reply is
not. For me, at least, there is simply nothing to add to SMS. Its role
is purely functional. I wasn't able to try out many of the new features.
Not just because nobody else had iOS 10, but because ‚Äì critically ‚Äì I
could not think of someone I'd be willing to bother with useless garbage
like... a doodle. And even if I could've, it's probably actually _less_
trouble to use one of those third-party applications in that Application
Shop Apple has been so proud of for so long. For old people like me,
even cleverly stowed buttons for unused features are _still buttons_. It
feels an awful lot like an obligatory alteration, not a visionary one,
and it's a shame that Apple's losing its awareness of the appropriate
time for one, the other, or neither.

I feel like competence in coverage of Apple is heavily dependent upon
the ability to differentiate between the allure of an intelligently
blingy feature and the allure of an intelligently functional one. Crude,
I know, but ever more essential. *Contextual predictions* are impressive
and surprisingly-clever. It's encouraging to see progress in such simple
interactions, but ‚Äì be honest with yourself ‚Äì making use of it is
actually going to cost you time in the majority of cases. Hate to be
excessively meta here, but keep in mind ‚Äì again ‚Äì that I am not the
majority. I tend to type things out... It's my thing. If this is
completely obscuring my vision of any of these features' uselessness,
_please_ take the time to add to the discussion in the comments.
Discourse is the handiest security in such matters.

I've loved 3D Touch all along, even though something like 75% of the
time, I've been triggering it unintentionally. It's _very_ useful for
quickly grabbing web images, but I'm probably more of a thief than
you'll ever be. Mostly, I just like the sensation. The curt vibration
and brittle illusion of a third interactive dimension have provided more
functionality than... its actual functionality. With *touch and go*,
though, I can instantly conjure a concise summary of the current local
weather conditions, _and_ a singular story from Apple News. Though I'm
undoubtedly going to need to make a conscious effort to remember to use
them, anything's a plus when one's affection was already so irrational.

As to *Apple News* itself... It's just not the same application. The
‚ÄúFor You‚Äù roll was amusingly messy before but actual structure (read:
functional aggregation) has killed some of its beauty, I'm afraid. It is
_so_ much faster, though. We'll actually have to take it seriously, now.

I haven't gotten the opportunity to really use *rich notifications* yet,
but I can't imagine them _actually_ making anything much faster. Perhaps
singularly, I've always found my unconscious navigation to a given
application itself to be quick enough to consistently glance over ‚Äúno,
you don't have to leave the app‚Äù features.

I suspect the ability to *search photos by content* will be iOS 10's
most useful addition for myself. A few trials demonstrate that it can
differentiate between ‚Äúnightfall‚Äù and ‚Äúnight,‚Äù and ‚Äúclothed‚Äù and ‚Äúnude.‚Äù
(I have never been naked.) It's the most intriguing, too, because it
means more nuanced & controversial search parameters are just a few
years away. Search by expression? Even search by _emotion._ I can't wait
until Apple gets to wrestle with the perceived difference between peace
and apathy within an algorithmic context.

‚ÄúPlease define 'joy,' Mr. Ives.‚Äù

[[section0028.xhtml#as-dual-speakers-become-the-norm-in-smartphone-design-let-us-briefly-examine-and-explain-why-one-should-always-expect-to-hear-their-music-in-stereo]]
== As dual speakers become the norm in smartphone design, let us briefly examine and explain why one should always expect to hear their music in stereo.

Though I have many audiophilical sentiments and preferences, I
cannot‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääby conscience‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääfully claim the title because I‚Äôve never been
able to justify the allotment of funds necessary for the obligatory
equipment. (And my digital compressor usage in the production of
http://extratone.com/drycast[_Drycast_] and
http://extratone.com/futureland[_Futureland_] has been manifestly
vulgar.) That said, audio engineering is one of the few topics which I
can actually speak on with almost-academic authority, and my
pretentiousness-capacitated preoccupation with quality-of-life compels
me to bring up a ludicrously-rational standard that most of us have
continued to undershoot for far too long.

Two weeks ago, the abundantly-rumored omission of the 3.5mm audio port
in the iPhone 7 was finally settled. We played our own part in feeding
the ‚Äúcontroversy,‚Äù yeah, but I believe Apple was actually quite tardy in
labeling smartphone-bound analog audio as archaic, though I‚Äôm not going
to waste words in that discussion‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääit is definitely oversaturated, at
this point‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääbecause I think mono audio is an even more prevalent topic.

Honestly, out of all the missing features we‚Äôve lamented over in the
past decade, stereo speakers should‚Äôve been the most aggravating. The
gigantic difference, of course, is that the industry (and‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääby muddled
extension‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääthe consumers) has been all but silent in that regard. I
write you, now, because we should all be colossally disappointed with
ourselves.

Two channels. Left and right. Read:
http://www.diffen.com/difference/Mono_vs_Stereo[Mono vs. Stereo] But why
should you care? What if Google‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääsomehow‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääfailed to provide you with a
significant difference?

One channel of sound is‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääin terms of locale‚Ää‚Äî‚Äärigidly static in your
perception. Doubling the data creates a spectrum, adding
*dimensionality*, which is infinite, ya know. Playing back audio in
stereo, through two or more diaphragms (the fundamental hardware unit of
sound reproduction,) now enables the exhibition of *audio pictures*.

If this is entirely new to you, I want you to do something. Find
yourself a pair of headphones or a set of two or more computer speakers.
(If these aren‚Äôt available, consider your car‚Äôs sound system. If it‚Äôs at
all current and healthy, it‚Äôs gonna do the trick.) Bother to discover
‚Äú*L*‚Äù and ‚Äú*R*.‚Äù That is, left and right. Orient accordingly. Download
http://www.extratone.com/media/bikefest2016preview.wav[this 37-second
clip] I recorded at http://www.extratone.com/audio/bikefest/[BikeFest]
with my Zoom H2n. (Be advised: the preview is formatted in 5.1 surround,
so it‚Äôs a very large file for its playback length.) Listen, obviously,
and then listen again on your singular smartphone ‚Äúloudspeaker.‚Äù

*That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm talking about.*

Why am I being so abashedly patronizing? Why am I transgressing against
our particular assumptions about you‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääthe informed, savvy millennial
audience? Because the vast majority of playback I hear in day-to-day
life is still from a singular diaphragm; a singular source.

A topical example: _I am shown a YouTube video on an iPhone_. (A
pre-iPhone 7 device, that is.)

_Walking downtown, I pass a small band of adolescent skateboarders
listening to Cannibal Ox on a Samsung Galaxy Note._

Worst of all: _I find myself watching a Netflix film on my iPhone, in
bed, not having bothered to wear the $200 pair of QC15s sitting within
arm‚Äôs length._

Informed or not, *consumers are neglecting audio*, and dimensionality,
alone is worth a change. Recent years have allowed the unlimited
bandwidth assumption to become habit, so even the vast majority of
today‚Äôs spoken word programs (like podcasts)‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääwhich, in general, stay
in the ‚Äúcenter‚Äù of their mix, making little to no use of the left-right
spectrum‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääare produced in stereo, now. In many cases (including a few
of ours,) this doublesizing is often for the sake of introductory
themes, alone. If you care to imagine a more data-frugal society, the
‚Äúwaste‚Äù is ridiculous. It is not unrealistic to expect such a reality in
the near future, but the same holds true for the reverse.

In the present‚Äôs abundance, though, the result is simply a decrease‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääas
a whole‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääin playback‚Äôs ‚Äúfull experience,‚Äù if the hardware is not
changed. Imagine how great it‚Äôd be if a digital audio formatting
standard could be developed that‚Äôd enable a singular file to be mono or
stereo, if needed/utilized, to trim off redundancy, sorta like variable
bit rate. Get on that, would ya?

So, why haven‚Äôt we become more diligent about our sound experiences? 1
billion iPhones in circulation, all with mono playback by default, are
suspect culprits, I think. Of course, there are other devices, but none
as influential‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääeven the iPod, funny enough‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääon fundamental digital
functions like music playback. And honestly, when is it appropriate or
suave to take the extra steps?

____
_I want to show you this song. Let me untangle my headphones‚Ä¶ Yes, okay.
Put them in. I‚Äôm going to sit here in silence for four minutes, looking
into your eyes as you listen to the entirety of this track._
____

It‚Äôs never going to be socially acceptable. But what about wireless
alternatives? Apple‚Äôs new Air Pods look absurd, but their by-computing
optimization of the Bluetooth audio standard is revolutionary, in a
small way, in
https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/sep/25/hearables-iphone-7-airpods-bragi-the-dash-revolution[propelling]
the ‚Äúhearables‚Äù paradigm into the mainstream, if only for a moment.
If‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääin a strangely-audiocentric future‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääwe are _always_ wearing
multipurpose sound reproduction devices in our ears, perhaps the waste
of the Mono Monstrosity will be finally resolved. Until then, I suppose
all we can do is give it an extra thought, for our own quality-of-life‚Äôs
sake.

If you don‚Äôt know the story, please Use Your Googler; I am the _last_
source you should be receiving your first commentary from.

That so disclaimed, let us reflect on the fascinating‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääif somewhat
universally disturbing‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääposition in which we find ourselves. (Or,
should I say‚Ää‚Äî‚Ää‚Ä¶you find _yourselves.)_

Two options: a ruthless, ridiculously-overqualified and
progressively‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääappropriate flagship of a Democratic Party candidate,
opposite an out-of-control, offensive joke of a destructive force that
has been directed inward, toward his own Republican Party.

The only plausible hesitation for the former‚Äôs candidacy being a
fundamental misunderstanding of the office‚Äôs necessities, and of the
dangers of the ‚Äúhonesty‚Äù popularly idealized in the latter.

At least they are opposites, so I‚Äôm interested enough to write you.

‚ÄúThe Great Debate‚Äù was an ultimate test‚Ää‚Äî‚Äänot of television‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääbut of the
American intellect, and it failed. From the outset of democracy‚Äôs
greatest leap in perceptive democratization, superficiality claimed
victory over policy.

Today, we are to extrapolate in the journey we‚Äôve taken in the 56 years
hence, into‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääby any standard of measure‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääanother world, entirely. Most
importantly, into one with such gigantically-swelling intellectual
disparity that it cannot possibly be monitored accurately, even
moment-to-moment. The continued feasibility of Donald J. Trump‚Äôs
candidacy is alarmingly conducive to the fact.

____
Note: Donald Trump will not be President of the United States as it has
been understood. If he is elected by process, he will be promptly
impeached, or the *function of the office itself* will be reexamined.
____

My bias is here: I genuinely believe sociopathic traits make for
effective leaders, and am unable to respect anyone without control over
their public persona. Trump‚Äôs defining acceptance of his undisciplined
whirling relegates him‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääfor POTUS, especially‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääto nothing more than an
amusement. He is incapable of the duties that define the position as I
know it. (e.g. a https://youtu.be/NDYiEHPfXRo?t=2m57s[commemorative
visit to Hiroshima], or https://youtu.be/p8ChMVPV4R4[participation in
the G20 summit].)

In such spirit, I‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääperhaps one of the least-qualified political
commentators with any sort of voice‚Ää‚Äî‚Äähave a question to ask of you:
*are you ready for the first ironic President of the United States of
America?*

Perhaps you‚Äôd counter, though, with something like: *are *you* ready for
the first *authentic* President of the United States of America?*

No, America, I am not. And‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääforgive my patronization‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääneither are you.
I know you feel _profoundly_ devoid of an *expressive* leader. You, the
most hardworking pillars of this society‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäI know you‚Äôve craved a voice
in the game for a very long time, but Mr. Trump‚Äôs is no nearer to your
own than Mrs. Clinton‚Äôs. In fact‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääin the inescapable game that is the
Presidency‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääshe is the better representative simply because she posses
the ability to assume any sensical power whatsoever.

The only insight I have to offer you is that honesty has not, does not,
and will never have a place in the White House as long as it stands.
This truth is neither good nor bad‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääit simply is.

I would plead you to acknowledge the complexity of political
maneuvers‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääregardless of your own moralism‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääand the truer nature of
the role you will ask one of these individuals to fulfill.

I would ask you to imagine which of the worst of the two you‚Äôd rather
hold the nuclear briefcase‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääthe tactful, or the primal?

But‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääif nothing else‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäI would suggest you ask yourself if you‚Äôd really
like the same mouth that formed
https://www.google.com/?gws_rd=ssl#q=donald+trump,+women[these words]
about women to deliver your next State of the Union.

[[section0032.xhtml#a-laptop-purchased-the-beginning-of-a-new-era-finally-witnessed]]
== A laptop, purchased. The beginning of a new era, finally witnessed.

_I managed to be reckless, tedious, and zealous in the usually-dry
process of purchasing a new laptop, and found the story worth sharing.
Expect a full review of the HP Spectre in the coming weeks._

The meteorological complaints you‚Äôve been hearing from mid-Missouri
since Friday aren‚Äôt inappropriate this time ‚Äì the middlefolk faced one
of their most fatal enemies ‚Äì a well-laid minefield of black ice. It
slowed our timid, ABS-oblivious society to ten percent or less of its
already near-postmortem pace.

_For God‚Äôs sake, at least learn
http://web.archive.org/web/20161224044948/http://auto.howstuffworks.com/auto-parts/brakes/brake-types/anti-lock-brake.htm[why
you needn‚Äôt pump your brakes] before you opt for infotainment extras or‚Ä¶
get your driver‚Äôs license._

I woke up with the same debt and imminent expenses as I did the day
before and without any more intention of buying a premium laptop than
I‚Äôve had for the two years I‚Äôve gone
http://web.archive.org/web/20161224044948/http://www.extratone.com/tech/ios10/[without
one].

Without the concept of mobile computing in its entirety, actually. I
knew I‚Äôd lost my desire to carry a loose bluetooth keyboard around
everywhere in case some insight were to fall upon me heavy enough to
justify reaching for it over my 6S Plus in a public venue, hunched and
squinting. There‚Äôs still nothing better at cranking out copy than the
Lap Top Computer, I suppose. I was holding out for a truly-substantial
alternative to Windows 10 and macOS, wanting to be enchanted by lite
delights like Acer‚Äôs cheeky Chromebook R11, but had decided in self-pity
that I‚Äôd probably never be able to stand a new operating system ever
again.

My mom graciously decided to take me mall shopping for Christmas, which
is comforting in its tradition of vapid routine. The state of a given
midwestern metropolis‚Äôs mall is a keen indicator of the culture‚Äôs soul,
I‚Äôve found, and ours is mostly crewed by destitute alcoholics, who are
my closest kin, and therefore my most appropriate company for _the
holidays_.

*Dillard‚Äôs is the second-best place to lose your mind in America.*

Even now, when the somber corners are not quite so desolate. The
acoustic sensation cannot be experienced anywhere else ‚Äì the battlecries
of the Me Generation‚Äôs pop reproduced by hateful diaphragms behind their
white plastic ceiling facades and absorbed again by palletloads of
mass-manufactured stonewashed denim, seemingly coming from a far-off
wholesale nether no matter where in the store you‚Äôve been buried. Ours
is a few decades old, now ‚Äì weathered and alone, which accentuates the
whole dystopia with a resolute air of infinity, as if it‚Äôs certain it
will outlast me. It probably will.

image:xhtml/https:/i.snap.as/ggT8UR5.jpg[HP Spectre x360]

I was deep within it all when I came across Dan Seifert‚Äôs
http://web.archive.org/web/20161224044948/http://www.theverge.com/2016/12/12/13914962/hp-spectre-x360-review-2016-laptop[praising
review] of the HP Spectre x360. As I‚Äôve constantly confessed, _The
Verge_‚Äòs lot are the only institution of their kind I‚Äôve come close to
trusting _too much_, so it was no small thing to see something so
certain as ‚Äúthe premium laptop to buy this year‚Äù in his subhead.

The last time I was in the market for a laptop, there was little room
for aesthetics in the equation. We have been taught this past decade
that beautiful devices come in fruit form, only. Somehow, I allowed
myself to integrate the ridiculous sentiment that MacBooks were the only
option for anyone with any reverence for tactile experience. As I expect
you‚Äôre aware of to at least some degree by now, Apple‚Äôs diligent study
of desirability over the years is the singular force behind their
lordship, and it‚Äôs the token MO of tech opinion to confuse it with sex
appeal, resulting in expressions like ‚Äú[apple hardware device] is sexy,‚Äù
which is a pityingly desperate delusion. Do you actually find brushed
aluminum appealing in any bodily sense?

We did once, of course. Your infatuation with the stuff probably peaked
the moment you first grazed it, and ‚Äì if you‚Äôre anything like me ‚Äì you
could be harboring more aesthetic frustration with their longstanding
occupation than you think. Infatuation must be starved to survive, and
we‚Äôve been eating up Apples by the bushel for a decade.

Haha.

But really, though ‚Äì by the _billion_.

I saw images in that Spectre review which I was completely satisfied
with. I watched that new HP logo as it traveled through the frames,
stupefied. Out of precious ignorance, I experienced real desire in that
undesirable place. (Which could actually represent some sort of defeat
on my part, but I‚Äôm not too bothered.)

image:xhtml/https:/i.snap.as/wcEdRy2.jpg[HP Spectre x360]

And in the midst of those desolate people in their fortress of
mediocrity, my mom and I hatched a plan to indulge upon the best part of
desolation ‚Äì impulsive, subsidized gluttony. We‚Äôd stop by the pharmacy
to fill my anti-depressant script before renavigating Bourgeois Bumper
Cars to get to Best Buy, where she‚Äôd let me use her credit line to
purchase my final choice in the segment.

*Best Buy is the best place to lose your mind in America.*

I could‚Äôve sworn it made good sense to me, once ‚Äì in Middle School, when
my friend and I were spending most of our free time emulating the first
generation of tech-reviewing YouTubers ‚Äì but now, it reminds me of a
darkwood restaurant with its closing fluorescents on, shining in the
inverse frequency of a bug zapper ‚Äì casting a more effectively-repelling
ambiance for the human psyche than anything else _I‚Äôm_ capable of
dreaming up, at least.

I used to fucking _visit_ that store for no purpose but to see and
experience the diluted bit of the handset renaissance with enough
momentum to coast its way here. I probably spent a full sixty minutes
wandering around by my own volition on a handful of occasions.

But these days, I am perturbed from the onset in a big way. There are
too many blue vape enthusiasts on the sales floor at any given time, and
they all want me to leave. They loaf around the carcass of consumer
technology‚Äôs passion, not realizing, I guess, that I already know it
‚Äôtwas they who killed it. (The stench is strongest by the wearables.)
It‚Äôs eerie how little the Big Box itself has changed, considering the
decade their goods have traveled.

Under a fittingly-gray sky, I wash my pill down with La Croix and a Kind
bar to preempt the appropriate rumination in my mouth as we inch toward
my Final Financial Doom with the spooked sliders. Though we never exceed
5mph, there are abandoned vehicles littering the shoulders and medians
in varyingly absurd orientations. But I do not jest ‚Äì today, I am
silent, for I am one of them.

By the time we reach the store, my medicine has once again placed my
soul in Safe Mode, so we shuffle into the grotesque thing. There are
four employees in sight ‚Äì no one else ‚Äì and they all send their beady
eyes my way. I have too much purpose in my consumerist jowls to pause,
though, so I rush to the laptops near the opposite wall in an attempt to
get an early estimate on my current level of personal computing idiocy.
Naturally, my Mom snags one of another four associates immediately. In
this work, I shall refer to him as Zoroaster.

image:xhtml/https:/i.snap.as/pCbk7GB.jpg[HP Spectre x360]

Despite having never seen 80% of the displayed devices in person before,
I am able to spot the Spectres quickly, which is a good sign. I am
immediately elated by the contrast to the depressing mushbooks I
remember HP making in the oughts. The bezel‚Ä¶ the brilliance of the
display‚Ä¶ the details of the visible body. I open _Extratone_. I open
_The Verge_. I am hoping that Windows 10 will not be as much of a kicker
as I‚Äôve expected.

I‚Äôm not a minute before Mom and Zoroaster have found the new MacBook
Pros. Nobody remembers the password to the 13-inch, but the 15 is
showing off its ‚Äúdeep blacks‚Äù and ‚ÄúSpace Gray‚Äù mood. The Verge looks
phenomenal, and its icon in the touchbar catches my eye. I manage to use
it to switch tabs, the less-attuned degenerate in me noting the extra
spanning required over CMD-TAB.

‚ÄúHave you tried the new keyboard?‚Äù asks Zoroaster.

I hadn‚Äôt. It‚Äôs as indescribable as you‚Äôve heard, but suggests legitimacy
is Apple‚Äôs effort to bridge the transition from physical keyboards to
their touch replacement. Terrifying legitimacy.

‚ÄúYou get used to it,‚Äù he says.

I open Pages and click out something ridiculous. Yeah‚Ä¶ _click_. I‚Äôm sure
there‚Äôs a better onomatopoeia available by way of just about any
technology website, but I didn‚Äôt bother to study the sensation after
realizing that it‚Äôs a con for my number one use of a Portable Computer ‚Äì
*_clacking_*.

It‚Äôs not as if the thing isn‚Äôt gorgeous, though, in its way. After years
of usership, I can tell you that it is undoubtedly a superb execution of
the MacBook marque. It‚Äôs polished. It‚Äôs The New One. But it is also
bleak and slateish. Some might even say _dystopian_. Do I want to carry
such a thing around with me everywhere? Do I even want to carry it _out
of the store?_ What will I tell my friends? _What will I tell my staff?_

$2,000 of my future spent on what is now a piece of _distinctly_
establishment design‚Ä¶

I return to the x360 to see what can be done about Windows‚Äô appearance
these days.

_Purple-gray taskbars‚Ä¶ Hm._

*It‚Äôs a sale.*

Let me be honest with you ‚Äì I spent some ninety minutes going between
the two. Even if I‚Äôd endured the shame and self-disappointment of
choosing the MacBook Pro, the simple grunt of the _challenge_ the
Spectre presents to it is no small milestone.

As Zoroaster scrambles to remove my new machine from _The Hanging Jail_,
I am drained from the decision, but aware that my perspective on the
world has changed. I‚Äôve been working on an editorial for the past few
weeks that‚Äôs mostly alarmed howling about the industry‚Äôs utter lack of
passion, as of late, but seeing the Windows-running department‚Äôs devices
and their matured design ‚Äì _finally_ beautiful without obvious Apple
influence ‚Äì had truly revived some little flame of hope within me.

Lithe Zoroaster was confused by UPCs a bit, as is understandable, and
began juggling three Spectre boxes atop the prison lift, screaming the
numbers ‚Äì one at a time from each device ‚Äì to his bewildered disciple,
below.

Throughout the later half of the whole ordeal, I‚Äôd had company ‚Äì some
sort of blonde working man who‚Äôd also braved the frictionless waste to
calm himself with debt. I‚Äôd been elated at the opportunity for
companionship, at first, but he‚Äôd found himself unable to escape the
store‚Äôs bespoke Apple Hole. I did my best to help him, but failed hoist
his girth from the 15‚Äôs benchmark suction. I‚Äôd left him there, bound.
May my dreams n‚Äôer be haunted by the fading portrait of his tortured,
middle class face.

As the Best Boys did their dance, he somberly came to my side. The
grimace he‚Äôd worn in the struggle had fallen away. I knew what was
coming before he formed the defeated words: ‚Äúgo ahead and grab me the
500 while you‚Äôre up there.‚Äù

As one does when they stumble upon a stranger‚Äôs funeral, I bowed my
head.

Here begins the part that sorta makes me look like an idiot.

After signing my mother‚Äôs lengthy loan agreement, Zoroaster ‚Äì the little
devil ‚Äì asked if I wanted the _Special Edition_, just behind me. I‚Äôd
stopped by last year‚Äôs Big Boy Spectre ‚Äì the ballsy-ass copper-toned
masterpiece ‚Äì and had wished for a moment that the look could‚Äôve carried
to the fresher x360.

The monospace Hewlett-Packard logo blinded me, and the unlit display (it
hadn‚Äôt been set up yet) concealed the wider bezel of‚Ä¶ The older Spectre
13t ‚Äì with which I write, now.

I didn‚Äôt notice my blunder until after our treacherous return, and could
not care less.

[#section0034.xhtml]##

_The following was sent as part of https://tinyletter.com/DavidBlue[a
personal TinyLetter] I've just begun in the hopes of rejuvenating my
ability to tell stories._

There are a few entities which continue to validate what I'm pursuing,
but https://twitter.com/joshuatopolsky[Joshua Topolsky] and his
https://theoutline.com/[_The Outline_] are particularly worth noting. In
search of reassurance, I listened to a
https://digiday.com/podcast/outlines-josh-topolsky-theres-much-sameness-digital-media/[podcast]
he appeared on in February, last night, and also found
https://longform.org/posts/longform-podcast-27-joshua-topolsky[one] from
2013, when he was still EiC of _The Verge_. Basically the entirety of
the first is within the idealism I've risked most of myself for, in case
you're curious. I've looked up to Topolsky in a huge way, this past
year. He has done ‚Äì and is doing ‚Äì many things which I am intrinsically
drawn to earn for my legacy, and the presence of his wife on his staff
(their few
https://soundcloud.com/tomorrowpodcast/episode-28-laura-june-and-the-contrarian-disposition[podcasts]
together are adorable in a very particular way,) is idyllic in
appearance, at least. I love the way they talk about each other. I
suppose spousal editorial staff is probably the personal hell of a good
many people. Perhaps, it's even my own. Listening to him talk on
Digiday, though, reminded me ‚Äì along with a few other works I've
consumed lately ‚Äì that _technically_, _Extratone_ is a _business._ Or at
least... That it must become one eventually or die forever. While trying
to explain my future plans to a friend, I inadvertently layed out some
'steps for growth.'

. *Form and activate the community.*
. *Build a beautiful, one-of-a-kind method of content delivery.*
. *Attain a fairly dependable content cadence.*
. *Sell the product in a way that immediately and ‚Äì from then on ‚Äì
consistently ensures and/or furthers its quality.*

I guess we're somewhere between 2 and 3 right now. I'm still building a
body of written work more or less on my own, which is okay, considering
that nobody is paid. I suppose it'd be most desirable ‚Äì before I move to
the Northwest ‚Äì to figure out how to make _The Tone_ as much of a
learning experience for my closest staff as possible. And regardless of
all other external goals of the magazine, I think it is more than safe
to say that I've learned more in the past 10 months from a fucking
WordPress website than I would've if I'd spent that time at the
Journalism school. The first annual renewal payment for extratone dot
com just went through, actually. A year ago, I was _much_ more
entertaining, but virtually directionless. I honestly can't tell if I
feel any better internally, day-to-day, but I know I am at least
attaining the capability of real friendship for the first time in my
life, and I suppose that's more than worth losing virtually all of my
engagement on Twitter.

Perhaps its even worth losing a portion of the freshness in my
perspective ‚Äì the stuff I thought made it worth it in the first place.
Especially if my staff maintains it healthily within their own.

I'll admit that ‚Äì in retrospect, after spending a year reading, writing,
and digitally fussing ‚Äì a lot of my original content smells like edgy
nonsense. Some of the work within our network does too, honestly, but
it's usually much less so.

Of course, that transition required an excruciating crucible, for me,
but that's exactly why I'm incessantly compelled to make as much use of
my trauma as possible: so that my friends and staff may be able make
progress toward more fulfilling lives without such a massive up-front
cost.

As I was writing my https://bit.ly/hellbird[interview with mastodon's
creator], I kept an eye out for related coverage, and eventually saw
what
_[PCMag_](http://www.pcmag.com/article/352875/what-is-mastodon-and-will-it-kill-twitter)
did, and it's unwanted rant-spuringly aggravating language.

For most of my adult life, I've been trying to figure out why
publications like _PCMag_ feel it necessary to belittle their audience
_and_ their subjects to such a degree. Silicon Alley can't possibly be
_that_ vapid as to nix all soul in any story, ever.

image:xhtml/http:/gallery.tinyletterapp.com/e8ecb4f78686444d5a5c89d53c49de7c8feb8ac5/images/f15ad2c3-dbd3-4697-9c37-b4d97f260dd8.png[uh]
_I mean‚Ä¶ What in the hell is this, even?_

I haven't been a reader since I used to loiter in Barnes & Noble with a
pile of print editions in the oughts, but this sort of layout has got to
be some kind of *digital sin.*

I'm not going to bother digging through the publication to compare this
work with others for the moment. Perhaps one day, I'll feel the need to
polish this rant into an argument and make it more visible. Surely,
though, the proximity of this abomination to the word _Mag_ or even
_Magazine_ must keep _somebody_ awake at night.

That's not to say it doesn't take some sort of discipline. I doubt I
could write in this way without hulking hyper-deliberately over
_wherever the fuck this dialect comes from._ I think it's almost
certainly more efficient as an informative device than my piece, or
https://motherboard.vice.com/en*us/article/mastodon-is-like-twitter-without-nazis-so-why-are-we-not-using-it[Sarah
Jeong's], but the assumption that readers would be so disinterested as
to hesitate to even commit to _complete sentences_ regarding something
_actually_ newsworthy for a technology publication should be taken
personally.

_(This is going to echo what Topolsky said in both of those podcasts in
big ways, but I'll try to keep it relatively brief.)_

*I believe there is an audience that is craving attention to detail in
their stories, a more intimate, longer-lasting, and more invested
relationship with a much smaller number of publications.*

Even a sense of involvement in the process. It's probably a direct
result of my longtime consumption of car magazines ‚Äì most of which still
have sizable sections dedicated to direct, public correspondence with
readers. It's also cross-platform to a surreal degree. Auto journalists
of all tiers will straight up engage with you on Twitter. (_MotorTrend_
literally prints YouTube comments.)

Sure, the readership is old, and the topic is an outlier (it's fairly
common knowledge that 'car people' are waaaay more vulnerable to
obsession than other special interest communities,) but the species is
more or less the same, and the results are plain as day, any time you
care to look. In recently returning my attention to technology
journalism, I've noticed an irritating affront to meta conversation with
strangers. My theory is that they've been paid for their words so long
that they develop a very particular greed towards them, which is why
academic journalism institutes are immediately shunned by their alumni
after graduation until they are definitely Too Tired to sling copy and
begin to climb sortof diagonally through editorial titles until they are
stashed away in some hole. Then, after ruminating until their first
encounter with Actual Death ‚Äì if they're still interested in the whole
thing ‚Äì they crawl out to be propped up in front of moderately sized
bodies of petrified students to scream in 100% bitterness about _The
Ethics_ that plagued them spiritually and financially their entire
career at the acolytes as their last joke on the world.

But they won't engage with strangers on Twitter.

As someone who ‚Äì for better or worse ‚Äì chose to sidestep the academic
route, I will never advocate for any value in withholding information ‚Äì
especially funny stories ‚Äì about _Extratone_'s operation. If anything,
_rediscovering relevance_ is a wholly meta pillar of our editorial bent.
(Hence, why Tim calls us _The Nieman Lab of Community College._)

I also believe the subscriber & advertising revenue models are
_directly_ - if not _primarily_ - involved in the constriction of
conversations regarding a publication's operation. It's my goal to
cultivate a group of subscribers that are directly invested in the
product (there's another new word on my part) financially,
intellectually, and emotionally. It's not exactly unheard of, ya know.

_Anywho_, I'm going to leave you in peace for now. I've really enjoyed
this wanton spewing of conjecture, but then... who doesn't love to go
on, unchecked?

Is _this_ what blogging is? It's fucking obnoxious.

Thank you for reading and _beware the fucking egg_.

== Eugen Rochko has spent this year perfecting federated social media in Mastodon ‚Äì his open source project. We spoke to him just hours before it became a global tech conversation.

The saga of Twitter, Inc. has been rejuvenated in 2017 by Tump's antics,
corporate drama, and an amalgam of user and non-user disquiet with its
decisions, though its financial viability has been in prominent industry
conversation for half a decade. Since its pre-2010 outset, many 'a'
feature has accumulated on its original, still-iconic skeletal software,
and ‚Äì though the net is undoubtedly positive ‚Äì a few have gone.

Last Thursday, the company revised in bravado its poultrian default
profile picture and its system of replies to exclude @s on all of
Twitter's proprietary services, drastically changing two of its visual
mainstays, and prodding a particularly lucent cacophony. Turn your ear,
and you'll hear many familiar terms in the chants: _limits, chains,
strings, harassment, feedback, gamergate, nazis, etc._

These conversations are important, but they've gotten awfully stale.

If you listen a bit more carefully, you'll intercept a new one:

_Mastodon_.

It's the open source brainchild of Eugen Rochko, who's known
colloquially as https://mastodon.social/@Gargron[Gargron].

He's had one hell of a week.

Between the night of our first emails and our conversation, his flagship
http://mastodon.social/[mastadon.social] instance had doubled in users.
Less than two hours after we said our goodbyes, his name was on _The
Verge_'s front page.

Despite the urgency of it all, he graciously lent me his time just after
breakfast on Tuesday to discuss himself and the story behind the
project, while the most significant day of his life was building around
him.

‚ÄúI'm perfectly fine with being called _Eugene_ by Americans.‚Äù

Though the ink's still fresh on his compsci diploma, he's clearly
prepared for the American press.

*What's the story behind the project? Do you remember the specific
moment when you decided to do this?*

Many years ago, I had a friend that was really into federated networks
when they were a new thing. That was when http://identi.ca/[identi.ca]
was first created ‚Äì at the very beginning of my developer knowledge and
career.

A good portion of the stories written so far on his platform have framed
it as an alternative to Twitter, which early Masto adopters refer to as
‚ÄúHellbird,‚Äù or ‚Äúthe bird website.‚Äù Eugen isn't afraid to acknowledge his
investment in the format.

I was a heavy Twitter user and I wasn't happy with where Twitter was
going, so I decided to check on how the federated stuff was doing in the
meantime. I found it in a very sad state, but thought I could
contribute.

He began building on his own, with Tweetdeck's standard in mind.

____
I thought 'if I'm going to do something, it needs to have realtime
updates and it needs to have columns.' I started with a bare-bones
prototype while still [at University] in May or April of last year. It
had no user interface, only an API that I was using from the command
line. And I thought 'okay, it works. that's great.' Then, exams came.
____

Academics had to come before the project at first, but it soon supplied
an ample post-graduation diversion. He focused his energy on building
something more complete and eventually launched a
https://www.patreon.com/user?u=619786[Patreon page].

____
I https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=13303346[announced] it on
HackerNews, and that was the first public release of the project. That's
when I got my first users who weren't my friends, and some who were new
to federated networks.
____

That was just over 100 days ago, and it gave way to his first feedback.

____
I started working on the first feature requests, shaping the project a
bit differently. People were a lot more focused on privacy features than
I thought they would be, although in retrospect, it makes sense. The
previous [federated] project ‚Äì GNU social ‚Äì did not really have a focus
on privacy features, or anything built in by default.
____

It compelled him to change things, and his work was well received.

____
Over time, I kept working on new features, and waves of new users came
when it went viral in certain circles. The first was HackerNews and
Product Hunt. https://twitter.com/aral[Aral Balkan] ‚Äì a Twitter user
with over 30,000 followers ‚Äì picked up the project, gave it a shout out,
and even did a giveaway of his app. He had a lot of followers from
Holland; the Mastodon timelines became mostly Dutch.
____

Next was Marxist anime Twitter (including
_http://mastodon.social/@extratone[Extratone]_ and
http://bit.ly/dbmastodon[I].)

Lots of furries; lots of LGBT people. That's when I really focused on
privacy features and making sure all blocks worked because these
individuals needed a safer platform than Twitter could offer.

processing jobs as of Tuesday morning.]

_Sidekick dashboard background processing jobs as of Tuesday morning._

‚ÄúAs you can see, the first bump is HackerNews, the second is Aral
Balkan, and then anime/Marxist Twitter.‚Äù

And the last ‚Äì now a bit out of date ‚Äì is this week's spike, which is
nearly double all previous waves.

*Are you responsible for all of the code?*

You can look at the https://github.com/tootsuite/mastodon[GitHub page]
to see a specific breakdown of who contributed and how many lines of
code, each. You'll see I'm at the top by a large margin, but there are
[additional] people who've contributed interesting, good features &
fixes, localizations, user guides, and documentation.

*What's the story behind the name?*

It's not particularly interesting. I'm a progressive metal fan, and I
listen to _Mastodon_ sometimes. They have a really cool name that refers
to a really cool animal. It's a fluffy elephant! What's not to love?

It's also the inspiration for Mastodon's mascot, which was penned by
Rochko's YouTuber friend https://www.youtube.com/user/dopatwo[Dopatwo]
after he realized how urgently he required an error page.

*What does ‚Äúfederated‚Äù mean to you?*

The biggest problem with this term is that it's new for lots of people.
People who've come across federated networks in the past__instantly__
understand what it means and how it works, and people who are new to the
concept have a lot of trouble before it clicks. But when Twitter first
started, people didn't understand what 'retweeting' meant, so it's not a
unique problem domain.

I don't know where it comes from ‚Äì maybe BitTorrent ‚Äì but people seem to
think that when something is 'decentralized,' everybody gets the same
thing; that it's all synchronized one to one. In actuality, 'federated'
means that people in different instances can _talk_ to each other, but
the _content_ is different depending on the users there, what they do,
and who they follow.

Though instances are infrastructurally independent, they can communicate
with one another. On a user level, timelines are still determined by who
you do and do not follow across the entirety of all instances.

*What if Twitter comes to you in the near future with a job offer?*

{empty}[Rochko laughs.]

If it was any other company, I would think about it. A job is a staple
source of income, and ‚Äì depending on the company ‚Äì could involve doing
something important, but I have zero faith in Twitter.

*Does this all mean that I finally get to live out my serif Twitter
dream?*

Yes, I suppose on your own instance, you could change the stylesheet...

*So if I set up my own instance and started charging for its use, I'd be
in the clear, legally?*

Yes, that's okay. The code is licensed under
https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.html[AGPL] version three, which I
picked because other projects in the same space are using it. The
difference between AGPL and GPL is that [the former] forces you to
contribute back to the appstream code repository if you make any
breaking changes.

For example, Eugen explained that WhatsApp originally used XMPP for its
chat protocol, which meant that Facebook and Google Talk users could
connect to it, too. However, the company progressively locked down the
platform over time, leaving virtually nothing visible that was unique to
XMPP in its current iteration.

To prevent somebody taking Mastodon code, placing it behind locks, and
stripping out the federation part to make Twitter II, I'm using this
license.

The thing to remember about free software is that 'free' means _freedom
of the user,_ not that it's zero cost. It's perfectly fine to charge for
free software because developers need to live, too.

*I've seen a lot of multilingual 'tooting' these past few weeks. Can we
expect an in-app translate function like Twitter's on Mastodon?*

I don't think I could put in a 'translate this toot' button because APIs
from Google and Bing are quite expensive at scale. I'm not 100%
promising this, but I can probably put something in where people can
select which language they post in, and then just filter the timelines.
That would at least solve the problem of being confronted with lots of
French posts, without knowing any French.

*The only complaint about Twitter I remember that hasn't already been
addressed here is the capability of editable 'toots.' Is that a
possibility?*

That won't happen. There's actually a good reason why they don't do
that. It's simply because you could make a toot about one thing, have
people favorite it and share it, link it from other places, and then
suddenly, it says 'Heil Hitler,' or something.

image:xhtml/https:/i.snap.as/jrP0kLj.png[Mastotile]

It's a bit preposterous to continue the conversation as if Twitter and
Mastodon are interchangeable entities. They exist in separate
ideological and mechanical spheres, and will both continue to do so for
a very long time.

That said, the fundamental user interface design and current
cross-community user saturation _do_ warrant comparisons between their
functions. More likely than not, you'll create a Mastodon account
because a link found you on Twitter, use it because you prefer its type
of ecosystem, and you'll stay after realizing that nearly all of your
age-old qualms have been addressed, if not already rectified. While
_FOSS_ and _Federated_ may seem at times like jejune ideologies, their
advantages are especially tangible in this context. Should you find
yourself needing to complain about something, you'll find an audience.
Perhaps it'll be your command line.

It's nothing but negligent to describe Mastodon as an _alternative_ or
_clone_.

It's more like Twitter's son.

It's leaner, quicker-to-change, much more flexible & democratized, and
less corrupt. Though I didn't ask its creator what he intended to gain
from all his effort, I think his commitment itself denotes a
preoccupation with progress. Those of you who've been let down by the
tools you've been given to control your words' exposure will find
startling competence in your ability to determine per-toot privacy, or
reserve your raucous photos and terrible memes from followers who are
not necessarily complicit consumers. Naturally, it's also much less
dependable, though a single instance outage will never leave you truly,
completely silent. And the support will come.

It's been a privilege to be observer and participant in the first
lightening of a new online community. In the moment, we enjoy our
lavender haze -when the spaces are filling primarily with users who are
sincerely interested enough in discourse to have sought it out.

Sarah Jeong's
https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/mastodon-is-like-twitter-without-nazis-so-why-are-we-not-using-it[account]
of her Twitter exile is a good, long read if you're craving more
specifics, and Eugen's https://medium.com/@Gargron[Medium] offers a more
complete explanation of federation and its place in the industry,
straight from the source. Apparently, he's just as articulate with words
as he is with code.

If I had to hazard a guess, I'd bet it's

[[section0036.xhtml#the-monumental-amount-of-unsubstantiated-gossip-and-conjecture-enabled-every-day-by-facebook-is-lethal-to-the-human-intellect-can-fire-be-fought-with-fire]]
== The monumental amount of unsubstantiated gossip and conjecture enabled every day by Facebook is lethal to the human intellect. Can fire be fought with fire?

Today, after positing on whether or not a pastry was in fact the
namesake of the battleship _Bismarck_, I was told by its owner ‚Äì a local
woman of a far-from-excusable age ‚Äì that ‚Äú[I] should be on that big bang
show.‚Äù Upon such fuckery, I looked her in her eyes and informed her that
she'd just changed my plans for the night: I was now going to go home,
wrap my lips around the barrel of my Beretta, and blow my brains out. I
should've known better than to so jest with a boomer immediately after
receiving such glaring indicators of minimal intellectual function, but
I fell for the hope ‚Äì as I often do, to no avail ‚Äì that such a jarring
reaction would encourage reflection on her foul, tragically misled
sentiments regarding the general state of youth, and perhaps even spare
a peer or two from future tribulation.

Instead, she called the police.

Three round cops found me, an hour later, approaching hesitantly.
Strangely enough, they were chuckling ‚Äì maybe to a little joke about all
the recent hubbub on the radio covering a recent wave of blatantly
negligent medical care in American prisons, though I hope nervous
laughter is just _SOP_ when responding to a suicide threat. As all
Columbia cops always are toward me, they were aggravatingly genuine and
hilariously understanding. I began by simply recreating my interaction
with their summoner, quoting her word-for-word, and ‚Äì I swear to my new
Lord ‚Äì all three immediately released a choral ‚Äúohhhhh‚Äù in unison. I'll
never know for sure if they actually assimilated the reality of the
situation so quickly, but it'd certainly seem that way.

Clearly, I should've threatened _her_ life.

Despite the day-to-day expression of our recurring wisdoms, habits,
instincts, patterns and cycles of cultural metamorphosis in the
discourse, the stream of ‚Äúwell, you know they were sayin' the world was
going to end when _I_ was in elementary school‚Äù to my ear has fallen
abruptly silent since the inauguration. Our parents and grandparents are
both impossibly fortunate and unfortunate, having to duck out as the
most multiplicative (read: sickest) cerebral orgy in the history of
mankind will just've begun nibbling on the slope to its climax. We'll be
lucky if we'll still be able to articulate our goodbyes by the time they
reach the door. Nonsense does a fuckin number on perceived wisdom, but
the gaps _are_ widening at a dangerous pace. Tectonic or domestic, we
are all straddling expanding space, and the chill of its draft is now
stealing too much of our heat to ignore.

Though it is entertaining in the moment (and otherwise redundant,) it
would not be _well-to-do_ of me now ‚Äì nor was it, then ‚Äì to leave the
conversation in edgy absurdity. Yes, a part of me would like to campaign
for _Sheldon_ to be reclassified as an expletive, in disgust, but ‚Äì as
an adult in all-out sprint to make up for stalled emotional development
‚Äì I must note that such a display of concern should've been at least
reciprocated with a bit of explanation, if not appreciation. Still,
there are much more appropriate reasons and situations in which to waste
public servants' time.

It's not news ‚Äì the _Theory_ is providing _some_ ghoulishly skewed
portrayal of less-than-forty pseudointellectuals. Obviously, my savior's
time was worth very little to her, but the fact that she spent any
quantity of anything at all engaging with even a decidedly mainstream
generationally ambassadorial bridge could be regarded ‚Äì if stretched ‚Äì
as the result of a curious seed, which has skyrocketed in human value,
as of late. It is undiscouragable. Read the trail a bit, and you'll find
that your frustration is simply an expression of the terror that's
ignited by the stagnancy of their pace.

_It's great that you've managed to inch over to modern-ish sitcoms from
Judge Judy and_ Independence Day _, mom, but you're gonna have to_
*_really pick up the pace_* _and work on following a few body
modification communities on the darknet._

If an absence of _solutions_ are the crux of the _blog_, here I'm now
gloating.

To whom does the commoner look to for such solutions when they'd prefer
not to terrorize their kooky middle age parents into a half century of
brutal fasting under vows of silence?

The Big Thinkers! The Men of the Hour.

Yes, _men._ All Big Bumbling Billionaire Imbeciles.

Elon Musk _cannot_ be the Nicola Tesla of the 21st century, or even the
_20th_, for that matter, because literally _every_ mechanically-minded
professional I've ever heard talk about battery technology has condemned
it in some manner as an inescapable dead end, developmentally. Perhaps,
then, the champion of electrochemical storage is _the_ False Prophet.

No, I'm not capable of citing research or conjuring Mars-capable
spacecraft, but I've been a bit too preoccupied with my country's class
war and its http://bit.ly/unescoliteracy[10% adult illiteracy rate].
It's all well and good to be privy to romanticism, but it's not the
1960s anymore. Even Howard Hughes would be more concerned for the
wellness of the species than our continued reach for the stars, were he
still alive.

Well. Maybe not...

Charles Lindbergh would be, though.

We spent the 1990s preparing to rid ourselves of history because the
smartest among us foresaw some facsimile of the renaissance we are
currently experiencing. If they'd been shown a glimpse of
http://bit.ly/measuringconsumerinfo[some statistics] on the volume of
media we consume, they'd exclaim of their pride ‚Äì no doubt ‚Äì in their
species' capability to progress, and perhaps even their own contribution
to it. However, extended observation of an average American's day-to-day
life would be lamented, in disgust, and a
http://bit.ly/millennialspew[huge portion] of the blame can be placed on
one t-shirt-touting cyberyokel: Mark Zuckerberg.

His name is stupid, his spawn is ruining my life, and he continues to
insist upon saying shit that frightens the bejesus out of me.

https://backchannel.com/we-are-entering-the-era-of-the-brain-machine-interface-75a3a1a37fd3[Zuckbrain]
is fucking scary.

‚Äúhttp://bit.ly/zuckfuck[Wiring the globe]‚Äù is fucking scary.

http://bit.ly/zuckbot[Jarvis] is fucking scary.

But Fuck, himself wouldn't be at all intimidating without his money. The
scariest bit is the lack of _class_ in the criticisms of his
intellectual influence. Farhad Manjoo's http://bit.ly/fuckbug[attention]
has been diligent and premium as a _Times_ er's should be, but the same
occupation bars him from authoring with the color of unsubstantiated
claims.

Mine does not.

Elon Musk is not an apologetic genius. He's willing to
http://bit.ly/aloofmusk[joke] about his intellectual distance from the
planet and its populace on Twitter. Apparently, his mind's even
surpassed the need to punctuate. Crazy.

Google is well on it's way to becoming the neo-Vatican... yada yada
yada, but they're too far gone ‚Äì I do not have the expertise to address
them. Fuck, though, is a singular short-sleeved, _Even Stevens_ -haired
young man http://bit.ly/crowdfuck[without] so much as private office
space (even though his sentiments on breathing room at home are
http://bit.ly/fuckflex[obviously inverse].)

Clearly, it's all just to protect him from the truth: *The Apostle
John's* *_Book of Revelation_* *is about Facebook*. Fuck's cyberchild is
the horseman, the beasts, _and_ the plagues, stuffed into one tyrannical
website.

____
And the smoke of their torment ascendeth up for ever and ever: and they
have no rest day nor night, who worship the beast and his image, and
whosoever receiveth the mark of his name.
____

If I can _repeatedly_ trigger accidental voice calls on Fuckbook
Messenger, don't tell me it's not possible to inadvertently live stream
myself on the pot.

____
The beast that thou sawest was, and is not; and shall ascend out of the
bottomless pit, and go into perdition: and they that dwell on the earth
shall wonder, whose names were not written in the book of life from the
foundation of the world, when they behold the beast that was, and is
not, and yet is.
____

Of course, it's unlikely that Mark's essence was bred entirely of evil,
but ‚Äì like Tump, in many ways ‚Äì he is an excruciatingly wealthy idiot.
Though he _is_ spending 2017 touring the United States, he
http://bit.ly/fucklearning[doesn't seem] to be all that interested in
_actually_ closing the gap between himself and the rest of us, which
suggests that he only wants us to throw us off his extra-terrestrial,
xenophobic scent. I can't imagine what _The Mothership_ would really
want with my Amazon browsing history, though.

____
And another angel came out of the temple, crying with a loud voice to
him that sat on the cloud, Thrust in thy sickle, and reap: for the time
is come for thee to reap; for the harvest of the earth is ripe.
____

Just to be clear, *he is not* *_The Antikhristos_*.

He'd better not be, anyway. I'd be absolutely Livid with Lucifer if his
choice of a figurehead for his Big Plan was such a Fucking dork.

I mean... if Fuck wanted to spend his time crafting 6000-word essays,
why the Fuck didn't he just build a Fucking CMS back in his Jesse
Eisenberg era instead of _the actual_ weekly-updated tower of digital
Babylon? Surely, Satan would know better than to waste resources and
pulverize creativity by ordering his Demonic Dev team to release regular
builds for build's sake rather than on a per-need basis, but that'd be
because The Tempter is an authority on _incentive_ as thoroughly as Fuck
isn't.

If you‚Äôre equipped with the privilege of literacy, you‚Äôve been reading a
lot about Fuckbook‚Äôs political consequences, recently. Frankly, _it‚Äôs
about Fucking time_, but I‚Äôm compelled to emphasize that the most
significant motor driving the politik is fueled by the eldest,
fossilized portions of our thought meat. According to Manjoo, ‚Äúthe News
Feed team‚Äôs ultimate mission is to figure out what users want,‚Äù dipping
in Facebook's ocean of action data, searching for a soul.

Yet another Fuckism that suggests he's an alien: everybody knows that
_nobody_ knows what they want.

There's a central mechanic of our brains that by nature wreaks a whole
helluva lot of contradiction. If you've ever mentioned ADHD with your
doctor, or know a hypochondriac/adderall fiend who has, you may have
heard it described as ‚Äúthe lizard brain.‚Äù Simply put, it's the brain
stem, and it's responsible for the most basal and primitively emotional
instincts and habits; an anti-intellectual agitant, arguing at all times
for the course of action with the most immediate gratification. _The
Great Clickbait War_ of 2013 was a startling demonstration that revealed
the strength of the hold Fuckbook had (and still has) on these reptilian
bits ‚Äì the true location of its power.

‚ÄúIn surveys, people kept telling Facebook that they hated teasing
headlines. But if that was true, why were they clicking on them?‚Äù

_Volition_ is the Word of the Day. Here, we must once again invoke an
ancient parable from the wise foretellings of the Disney film, _Smart
House_: *when dealing with human beings, boundless compliance quickly
leads to abject misery for all parties involved.*

Mindlessly, habitually, endlessly clicking... *this is how we die*.

Something about Fuck's direction is fundamentally poisonous to the human
mind. Yes, he _is_ assuredly too Fucking democratic, but misinformation
is far from the only form of evil his creation has assumed. If you can
jog your memory back a bit, you'll remember a much wider variety of
brain-rotting filth.

In lapses of their existences' finitude, the 40-something second cousins
of the world may still send you the occasional _Can Crunch Saga_ invite,
jarring you back to Jr. High in 2009, and forever associating themselves
in your mind with the horrors of mortality and *f u c k b o o k g a m e
s.*

Elon is a more likely candidate, but I'll leave those differentiations
to the not-idle cult masses.

More than one sixth of all living eyes
https://newsroom.fb.com/company-info/[see] Fuckbook every single day,
placing its consumption behind only eating and drinking as the most
universally human activity.

Mr. Fuck achieved his vision and became perhaps the greatest purveyor of
words who's ever lived. He's taught (or... is teaching) us something
very profound about ourselves: capability is not the whole of the
equation. Ability on its own cannot guarantee growth, but it can often
result in decay. Discussion does not inherently lead to _connection_.
Population is not a cure for isolation.

That said, I must begrudgingly admit to you that I, myself am one of the
100 million users who've depended upon a ‚Äúvery meaningful‚Äù Fuckbook
group for a ‚Äúphysical support structure‚Äù for which I have Fuck to thank.

I've spent half of my existence watching cheesy barnstorming movies,
whirling around die-cast biplanes, seeking out stories from old pilots ‚Äì
military and commercial, and eventually trained to become one myself. As
regular activities at young ages do, aviation became deeply ingrained
into my identity, but my local community is _very_ sparse ‚Äì it's not
exactly _cool_, these days. On Fuckbook, an unofficial group for members
of the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association has allowed me to stay
connected to the rest of the world's Soaring Nerds, which is no small
deal. It's the only forum which I am compelled to participate in with
100% sincerity and emotional effect.

Photos of members standing proudly next to their first airplane, or of
adolescent students in a similar pose after their first solo, or of
three old white rubes on a hangar picnic, laughing around a fold-up
table full of rudimentary ham sandwiches in front of two gleaming
Stearmans...

They tug around on my heart like nothing else in life can.

I stopped flying lessons at 16 because I began to see behind the naivety
of my childhood perception of what it meant to fly commercially and
realized that I was unequipped for- and uninterested in the sort of
challenges it presented. I haven't flown in seven years, but the
community will _always_ have a tremendous dividend of my core being.

These days, not a single person in my day-to-day life knows or cares
about aviation, which wouldn't be laudable whatsoever ‚Äì it's not exactly
the most relevant goingson at the moment ‚Äì were it not so _emotionally_
necessary for me.

A few days ago, a member shared a photo with the group of Charles
Lindbergh's modified Ryan cockpit, captioned ‚Äúwhat airplane am I?‚Äù

In my youth, Lindbergh filled my closest equivalent to the 'childhood
hero' role. My grandmother bought me a first-edition copy of _The Spirit
of St.Louis_ from a small town bookshop when I was six or seven, and I
carried it _literally everywhere_ with me until middle school. I watched
the Jimmy Stewart film tens and tens of times, and I cried when I saw
the _Spirit_ in the flesh at the Smithsonian, yet I've _never_ had an
informed conversation about any of it with another human being. It
really warmed me to see how many of the comments were correct answers.

Breaking news: it's nice to know that there are other people on Earth
who give a shit about the same things you do.

Again ‚Äì aspiration should always be encouraged. This is Fuck's vision
for his creation, and it _is_ feasible, even for myself. At least his
public persona ‚Äì however valid or invalid it may be ‚Äì is making a huge
effort to have positive consequence, even if his idiocy is imbuing
itself within all of humanity.

Fuck is too powerful to be exempted from responsibility for what
Fuckbook's done to the Western psyche over the past decade, but ‚Äì like
the Christian god ‚Äì perhaps all we need require is his repentance.

In all likelihood, you have heard of Electronic Mail, but I‚Äôve noticed
that much of our audience (and 18-25 year olds in general) have been
consistently estranged from it, despite its
http://www.journalism.org/2017/02/09/part-ii-characteristics-of-news-instances/[prevalence]
in news media. Perhaps it‚Äôs not immediately evident as _the coolest
thing_, but if ‚Äústaying informed‚Äù and grass roots-ing brands are still
as hip as they appear to be, email newsletters _should_ soon become so
groovy that you‚Äôll begin leaving the house for a down-the-street coffee
shop _just to be seen reading them._

[[section0037.xhtml#welcome-to-the-wonderful-world-of-aggregation]]
== Welcome to the wonderful world of _aggregation_.

In many ways, email newsletters are the antithesis of (and medication
for) Facebook‚Äôs school of ruminate aggregation. You know ‚Äì the doctrine
that will forever be remembered as the original intellectual catalyst
for the downfall of human civilization. The skimming and the jumping‚Ä¶
how many Facebook users could I fool by simply sending featured images,
headlines, and abstracts for social cards without any hyperlinked
destination? Could I manage to get Donald Tump elected President of the
United States by way of Scrolling Hypnosis, alone?

Staying _informed_ is a habit of time-honored traditions. Gramps has
stopped by Bill‚Äôs General Goods every weekday morning for twenty years
with a handful of change because _The Sleepyville Monitor_ is a part of
his identity ‚Äì dependent upon- and accountable to his trust. We‚Äôve
continued into 21st century news media as if a digital equivalent of his
readership would be _so_ difficult to fathom that legacy publications
are best-off forcing the standards of print onto the web instead of
investing in research/experimentation, which is why the fucking _New
York Times_ still sends your handset away to a separate _mobile version_
of their site ‚Äì a horrible remnant of browsing from the oughts that‚Äôs
rarely seen on _blogs_, these days, much less on properties of titanic
news powerhouses.

For whatever reason, most of the industry has behaved as if Grandpa‚Äôs
sort of routines no longer exist in day-to-day life, but ‚Äì if anything ‚Äì
our Automated Hell is _vastly_ more saturated with them, no? Unless
you‚Äôre sequestered away in a diligently self-made _Email-Free Zone_,
you‚Äôre receiving shit daily. I, myself, am considerably proud of my
~60,000 unread emails, and I‚Äôve conceded to the vast majority of the
popup opt-ins I‚Äôve encountered since shortly after our launch because I
rarely found myself visiting/reading undesirable web.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt email‚Äù is a sentiment I hear from young people often, which is
perfectly fine. I don‚Äôt vote!

If it‚Äôs true that ‚Äúnobody wants that,‚Äù nobody should be participating in
the democratic process. Yes, I‚Äôve experienced the _no patience for more
than 300 words_ phase of life, and I understand wholeheartedly the
desire to retreat forever from it all. I would much rather exist in an
old, open farmhouse with a wife, a garden, no internet, dusty old
literature, and two ancient Bentleys than spend all my time crafting
mirages in a black mirror, but neither cowardice nor negligence are
options for us, right now. This country doesn‚Äôt have room for any more.

That‚Äôs not to say that you should be _expected_ to read 6 hours of news
a day ‚Äì it‚Äôs the media‚Äôs (our) job to maintain our own accessibility,
and for this, daily/weekly newsletters are an unbelievably effective
method. The meta-aggregators in today‚Äôs industry are often paid
_exclusively_ to ease your digestion, both independently and by
mastheads.

https://twitter.com/davepell[Dave Pell] is a superb gateway from the
former ‚Äì an aggregation legend. His daily correspondence ‚Äì called
http://nextdraft.com[_NextDraft_] _-_ is more often than not the ideal
front page of the day.

I‚Äôm asking those of you youths yet without your own reading habits to
trust my taste ‚Äì if not my authority ‚Äì and explore some options from my
own inbox.

Ultimately, you just can‚Äôt replace a legacy die-hard-news shop for a
good political briefing. The http://www.politico.com/playbook[_POLITICO

politics as you walk about your life, and many of
https://www.newyorker.com/newsletters?mbid=nl[_The New

are a great longform, much more visual compliment. For a _slightly_
less-chaotic, but still relatively unproven alternative to the former,
try https://www.axios.com/axios-am/[_Axios AM_].

_National Geographic_ may seem a bit _old guard_, but has remained a
consistently excellent photographic publication. Its print edition has
no place but on the poll in tangible media subscription terms, but it
_has_ been quite depressing, as of late. Turns out, we‚Äôve made quite a
dystopia for ourselves, and their ability to encapsulate the world can
be overstimulating, at times. If you‚Äôd like a bit more control ‚Äì or are
uncompromisingly digital-only ‚Äì its web edition has matured quite
competently, and is elegantly parsed by
https://members.nationalgeographic.com/[their newsletters]. (You‚Äôll need
to create an account, if you don‚Äôt already have one.)

image:xhtml/https:/i.snap.as/JP71lXK.png[Medium Digest]

It‚Äôs no secret that Medium has been on the decline, lately ‚Äì and it‚Äôs
always required a particular sort of tolerance ‚Äì but _The Daily Digest_
still delivers a few important essays, occasionally. And of course ‚Äì
there are options by regularity and topic, which you can fiddle with
https://medium.com/me/settings[here] when logged in.

On the more innovative end of the industry, there‚Äôs
https://theoutline.com/post/1125/subscribe-to-the-outline-newsletter[_The

open-web publication ‚Äì is a bit underwhelming, but then again‚Ä¶ why
aren‚Äôt you just looking at the site, anyway? https://pudding.cool/[_The
Pudding_]‚Äôs output may be sparse, but ‚Äì again ‚Äì just‚Ä¶ _look at it._ I
can‚Äôt claim to have made much use of the information presented in their
gorgeous visual essays, but it sure is fascinating.

_The Verge_‚Äôs https://www.theverge.com/newsletter[Command Line] is often
so clever, _it can almost make tech news engaging_. (Our very own
http://bit.ly/thetone[_The Tone_] is directly modeled after it,
visually.) _WIRED_‚Äôs https://www.wired.com/newsletter[newsletter] isn‚Äôt
bad either ‚Äì it‚Äôd be excellent if its parent website wasn‚Äôt so _fucking
broken._

Then there‚Äôs https://warisboring.com/[_War Is Boring_] _-_ a
tactical/tech news site? I recently discovered. ‚ÄúFrom drones to AKs,
high technology to low politics.‚Äù I wouldn‚Äôt describe it as a primary
read for me, but it‚Äôs still nice to see what the Big Boys are up to,
once in a while. (I am mostly just waiting attentively for the _U.S.S.
Iowa_ to be put up for auction.)

If you‚Äôre a filthy word nerd like myself, it‚Äôs likely you‚Äôve seen a
Tweet or two from the https://twitter.com/HaggardHawks[Haggard Hawks]

After an excellent few years of playful indulgences, the project now has
a whole DweebNet with a
http://www.haggardhawks.com/newsletter[newsletter] that always
fascinates, if a bit dryly. What did you expect?

_The Poetry Foundation_ can also be
https://www.poetryfoundation.org/newsletter[easily convinced] to send
you their Poem of the Day, and biweekly newsletter.

And finally‚Ä¶ *the meta media folks*.

_Columbia Journalism Review_‚Äôs always the prettiest to look at when it
comes to coverage of industry, and their squeaky-clean perspective won
me over quite quickly. They send their ultra-clean, editor-compiled
http://archives.cjr.org/resources/[_Weekly Highlights_] every Thursday.
http://bit.ly/apneedtoknow[_The American Press
Institute_]http://bit.ly/apneedtoknow[‚Äôs list] isn‚Äôt a bad idea, either.
Then, of course, there‚Äôs Harvard‚Äôs _NiemanLab_, which offers
http://www.niemanlab.org/subscribe/[afternoon and Saturday morning
emails]. All three often cite the _Pew Research Center_, which offers
ihttp://www.pewresearch.org/follow-us/[ts own palette of email lists],
should you find yourself _hungry for d a t a_. Though, I do not, and I
enjoy them.

Landing on the ‚Äúhomepage‚Äù of even the most familiar online publications
can feel daunting and impersonal, but having an authority on the
industry (hopefully, with some sense of humor) parse the torrent and
deliver it unto _your personal inbox_ can ease the reading process into
a _much_ more intimate, sensical, enjoyable, and productive expenditure
of your valuable time.

For a publication of our scale, the routine of a newsletter can act
first as a simple reminder of our existence, and mature into a way to
reach out directly to our audience in a distinctly _magazine_
methodology ‚Äì one which pervades a real, consequential relationship with
consumers.

[[section0038.xhtml#a-late-geezer-s-first-go-at-the-dystopian-vr-experience]]
== A late geezer‚Äôs first go at the dystopian VR experience.

_Listen to this article read by Siri Voice 2 below..._

Earlier this year, Tim and I had the opportunity to try virtual reality
at the True/False Film Festival in a dark, curtained side room of a
commandeered Columbia art gallery, but we were both much too intoxicated
and loopy those last few hours of the fest, and we bailed. Call us
cowards if you must‚Ää‚Äî‚Ää_immersion_ can be a scary concept to those of us
who grew up reading science fiction, before the existence of the modern
video game console. I‚Äôve wanted just 30 seconds or so with a pair of
goggles, just to have an idea of what the increasing number of
Oculus-blinded pedestrians surrounding me are looking at. Thanks to
Isiah, I was finally caught up last night with a few VR YouTube videos
and _Farpoint_‚Äôs introduction on a PlayStation 4.

First, Isiah brings me the headset and describes in detail how exactly
to adjust it, but I forget it all and simply try to shove it directly
and violently on my face. Eventually, he takes it back and simply mounts
and adjusts it around my monstrous skull‚Ää‚Äî‚Äälike you would for a
toddler‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääand I lay eyes on the console for the first time. For whatever
reason, it never occurred to me that general GUI wouldn‚Äôt simply be
displayed in 2D, but by a literal _virtual display_, layed out in front
of me like a large, floor-mounted touch workstation. I‚Äôm astonished by
my ability to turn away from it to look at the rest of _Goggleworld_,
which is nothing but a deeply black void.

From my previous world, I hear Isiah and Hawthorn discussing what to
show me first, and YouTube is the settled-upon environment. As the
application is restarted in ‚ÄúVR Mode,‚Äù its startup screen is what
_really_ establishes the truth‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäI have _gone virtual_. I cannot use my
hands to shield my eyes from the branding‚Äôs glaring watermark and
terrifying red light. At its home menu, Isiah simply selects the ‚ÄúVR‚Äù
tab, revealing a selection of thumbnails for algorithmically-recommended
VR-shot videos on the service.

To begin, I am mounted on the tail of a superbike as it‚Äôs raced around
an American desert circuit. It takes a few seconds for high resolution
to buffer, leaving me briefly in a pixelized hell that would surely make
anyone sick, were they exposed very long. (I was especially excited to
become nauseous, to no avail.) At the getgo, I am occupied with the
rider‚Äôs butt since it‚Äôs center-frame if I stand in my usual posture.
Isiah points out the hovering HUD to my left containing a selection of
simulated digital instruments (tachometer, 7-segment speedo, etc.) Its
presence would suggest that the purpose of my virtual passengership is
to witness the lap as a motorsport enthusiast, but the rear of the rider
obscures most of my view forward‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäI cannot admire his line as one would
viewing a GoPro-or-otherwise POV of the same event, so I decide to try
and figure out which track I am hurried through. Though the vehicle is
tossed about in the required movements of motorbike operation, I myself
(the VR capture device) am impressively gyrostabilized, and the image,
static, as if I‚Äôm _actually_ hovering above the pair as they moved
along. I spin left and right, spotting a small gaggle of miniature wind
turbines and two wilting hilltop trees in the foreground. Behind them,
small sand dunes fill the space, all the way to the horizon.

After a few minutes, I am finally relieved early of my cutless lap for a
short _National Geographic_ documentary on a Viking revival festival in
Poland. I‚Äôm introduced to its Big Boys by a series of aerial shots
(presumably by drone, which is awfully un-Vikinglike) as they row their
Big Boat up(?) a relatively wide, tree-lined river. In contrast with the
lap, the jump cuts become a bit disorienting‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäI am eventually jumped
_in_ the boat for a moment, next to the sweaty, bearded lads‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääa few of
whom are shirtless. I notice a blurry church on the distant bank.
Suddenly, I float briskly across the small no man‚Äôs land between two
rapidly advancing battle lines of Nordic Nerds with real, era-specific
weapons and way too much free time. More lingering drone shots follow
from just a few feet above the ensuing conflict. Outside, Isiah confirms
Hawthorn‚Äôs suggestion that this is, indeed, _the one where they use real
weapons_ as I notice a pile of three or four men lying against each
other, motionless on the ground, right-of-center in the nearest line,
and mull over the sure disturbance of all this immersion the festival
has allowed in welcoming the presence of the surely-buzzing drone. _I
guess they‚Äôre dead_.

After the conflict, I am subjected to a dreamier, narrated montage
accompanied by cheesy synthesized orchestral music and featuring
disproportionately a particular man with a shiny, tatted bald head and
rather large feet with rather small toes, which he likes to wiggle
during these particular conversations. Thanks to VR‚Äôs omniencompassing
perspective, I am allowed to observe his wiggling in his every
appearance. The tone of the background music and the prevalence of
relaxed, conversing couples and sunsets in the scenes suggest
romanticism is the montage‚Äôs theme, but for me, it is the bald man‚Äôs
feet‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäI am too busy conversing with my two friends, across the divide,
in this world, to listen to any of what is said. Considering that
YouTube collects the dimensional data regarding where the user looks,
and for how long, I make an effort to bend my neck up and down in
extremes, and notice a patch of washed-out sky, distorting in the
distance, and ponder what‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääif anything‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääwe have gained in this
technology.

image:xhtml/https:/i.snap.as/ihtaDMF.jpg[VR Vertical]

Does an increase in the raw amount of visual data available to the
viewer actually make motion picture storytelling more effective? In the
few minutes of my VR taste test, I _did_ gain quite a bit of volition
over an equivalent 2D experience, but it didn‚Äôt seem like I‚Äôd
instinctively used it to gain much else. If one is specifically
interested in the shrubbery around a racetrack, or the more nuanced
undulations of a Viking‚Äôs foot, they can more likely than not find a
standard video on the World Wide Web that would more efficiently
entertain them. In specific situations, of course, a producer can
undoubtedly benefit by the ability to capture in 360 degrees, but‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääin
any sort of cinema, especially‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääit seems unnecessarily sacrificial to
relinquish entirely the narrative directorial control of shot framing to
their audience. However, I am the anti-expert on this subject,
obviously. My take on the viability of VR is Virtually Redundant
and‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääquite possibly‚Ää‚Äî‚Äävery wrong, but my time in its hell is not over
yet.

Isiah explains that it is time for me to _game_, and asks if I‚Äôd like to
try ‚Äúthe one with *the hands*, or the one with *the gun*.‚Äù As always, I
choose the firearm, as the ‚Äúhands‚Äù have not been found yet and the
hypothetical image immediately offered up by my imagination is of rusty
iron shackles. The Infinite Blackness has returned, and I cannot see
beyond it to determine what my host is up to. Then, it becomes outer
space‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääfilling with thousands of star-like white dots. The light-blue
outline of a virtual PlayStation controller appears where I assume him
to be, unattached and bumbling about. Soon, it jaggedly approaches, and
I feel him hand it to me. We have started its calibration process, which
becomes a bit frightening in my celestial surroundings, though at least
I have now gained participatory power over my new existence. I‚Äôd opted
out of wearing headphones, so the assistant‚Äôs malignant-sounding female
British voice comes softly from the television somewhere in front of me
as I point the beam of light the controller‚Äôs representation is now
projecting straight forward at the navigational arrows displayed ahead
and pull ‚Äúthe trigger‚Äù (R2.)

I am pleased by the idea of interfacing with software exclusively by
shooting it repeatedly before I am abruptly contained in a cage, now
being projected by a virtualization of the system‚Äôs sensor, which is
unsettling. I am now calibrating the hardware contained within the
physical device that captures the position of my body in the physical
world. I catch the word ‚Äúconfinement‚Äù in the assistant‚Äôs unending,
otherwise-inaudible directions, and quicken my pace. When it‚Äôs all done,
I return the controller to Isiah, who reboots the PS4, itself, before
launching _Farpoint_. My space becomes a lighter blue and fills with
little opaque bits of Sony Dust for a minute or two. Isiah continues his
rummaging for another peripheral as the title‚Äôs introduction begins to
play.

Two rather poorly-animated astronauts are co-hosting a live broadcast
from their craft, which is presented in a dramatization of a computer
display. They‚Äôve just met, but they‚Äôre both stacked with academia,
co-massaging their knowledge, which I choose not to listen to. Out of
view, Isiah unsuccessfully attempts to skip the whole thing before I‚Äôm
allowed to become _virtual_ again‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääthis time, atop the animated body of
another astronaut in a lone shuttle, approaching the mothership where it
holds, next to a large, very-_Star Trek_ ‚Äúanomaly.‚Äù From Deep Space
Nine, the two scientists continue to bicker over comms as I look around
the cockpit. Looking backwards has already become a favorite habit of
mine‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäI wonder where the shuttle‚Äôs bathroom is. For whatever reason,
the back of my character‚Äôs neck was animated, though it can only be seen
by looking rearwards and down, which distorts its shape into something
truly terrifying.

A bunch of unrelated plot follows, leading me to end up on a foreign
world, exiting my crashed escape pod. By now, Isiah has connected _The
Gun_, but something about it isn‚Äôt quite right‚Ää‚Äî‚Äämy character holds it
in a glitched, very uncomfortable-looking manner, and it‚Äôs suspected
that a fix would require a restart, and therefore‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääa replay of the
introductory cutscene‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääso I retire out of lack of patience.

If I were confidently reviewing PlayStation VR as a consumer purchase,
I‚Äôd cite a quote of Isiah‚Äôs: ‚ÄúI couldn‚Äôt find the thing.‚Äù In addition to
my first drone sighting, a few days ago in Colorado, this lost virtual
virginity is not necessarily unwelcome‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäI feel as though I‚Äôve acquired
a platform to better ponder the dystopia to which these and their like
industries add a certain comic spice. That said, I cannot imagine a
reason to once again enter the digital realm‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääand _who cares_?

Please enjoy your new worlds, kids.

== Nitpicking the recklessness of last year‚Äôs highly-awarded, class-blind black comedy

_Listen to this article read by Siri Voice 2 below..._

Indeed, it may be the time to jab at the rural, working-class South, but
Martin McDonagh
http://www.slashfilm.com/martin-mcdonagh-interview/[claims] to have
written his Golden Orb Special ‚Äúeight years ago,‚Äù long before Tump, and
any critical resolution the film provides is argued haphazardly.
Consequently, its eye is cast on this strange, satirical portrayal of
the Midwest in a manner which is inaccurate and insensitive enough to
irk this Missourian. When I saw it at Columbia‚Äôs Ragtag Cinema this
week, it was introduced by a young employee who noted that 1) Ebbing,
Missouri is not a real place, 2) the film was actually shot in one of
the Carolinas (an audience member suggested incorrectly that it was in
SC,) and 3) we should prepare ourselves to be roused a bit by a bar
scene in which a character pays $8 for two beers because ‚Äúthat just
wouldn‚Äôt happen‚Äù (the Ragtag also serves alcohol.)

The ‚Äúredemption arc‚Äù of the racist ‚Äúhick‚Äù ‚Äúloser‚Äù Officer Dixon (Sam
Rockwell) was rightfully
https://www.vox.com/2018/1/19/16878018/three-billboards-controversy-racist-sam-rockwell-redemption-flannery-oconnor[at
the center] of the film‚Äôs controversy, but even if one imagines his role
and fate written differently‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääperhaps with him irrecoverably shunned
and/or visibly punished for his excessive, hateful violence‚Ää‚Äî‚Äähis
rubishness would still be unforgivable. Living with his mother and
turtle feels like an effort to humanize him‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääand, by extension, racist
small-town cops as a whole. _The Huffington Post_‚Äôs
https://twitter.com/zblay[Zeba Blay] wrote an essential take on why
_Three Billboards_‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääwith its terrifyingly racist dork‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääwas received
the way it was.

____
Rockwell‚Äôs character is the racist uncle whom white liberals fear and
love. The ability to feel for him ‚Äï to root for him in spite of his past
transgressions, because he really is a ‚Äúgood man at heart,‚Äù an idiot who
doesn‚Äôt know any better ‚Äï offers a kind of catharsis for the white
viewer who can‚Äôt or won‚Äôt deal with true nuance, who is unable to
reconcile their own complicity with their desire to be ‚Äúgood.‚Äù
____

It‚Äôs not as if the film isn‚Äôt technically well executed or
refreshing‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääthanks in large part, yes, to Frances McDormand‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääor that I
will not regret appealing on behalf of my home state, but it‚Äôs hard not
to speak up when Hollywood shits so recklessly on my people. I don‚Äôt
much like writing about movies because there are so many voices who
consistently speak so much more effectively. NPR‚Äôs _Pop Culture Happy
Hour_, for instance, did a wonderful job
https://www.npr.org/sections/monkeysee/2017/12/01/567291457/pop-culture-happy-hour-revenge-redemption-and-three-billboards[dissecting]
the film‚Äôs depictions of racism and domestic violence.
https://twitter.com/GeeDee215[Gene Demby] commented that ‚Äú[McDonagh]
doesn‚Äôt get these particular physics of American racism, and he‚Äôs not
interested in them,‚Äù and I think it‚Äôs reasonable to suggest that Mark‚Äôs
not very versed or interested in the physics of American class, either.

If you must differentiate the state of Missouri as a cultural whole
between North and South, it is currently more red than blue‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääwe went
http://enrarchives.sos.mo.gov/enrnet/[56% for Donald and 38% for
Hillary]‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääbut ask anyone from ‚Äúsomewhere down in the Georgia, Florida,
Alabama corner‚Äù‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääas McDonagh put it -where we generally fall, and
they‚Äôd be unlikely to regard us, fraternally, as the same part of the
country. The accents in _Three Billboards_ are not among the wide
variety of local dialects you‚Äôll encounter anywhere in the state, but
perhaps they wouldn‚Äôt be out of place in Sylva, North Carolina, where
the film was
http://wlos.com/news/local/big-movie-comes-to-sylva-shooting-dates-for-three-billboards[actually
shot].

Regardless of all potential criticism of the film‚Äôs cultural perspective
or technical excellence‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääand I think most of it is more valid than any
take I could possibly offer‚Ää‚Äî‚Äämy particular issue with it comes from a
culmination of tasteless decisions. If one reasonably successful Irish
director were to produce a patronizing film at the expense of Missouri‚Äôs
working class filled with a ton of absurd, misconstrued characters
portrayed by A-list talent _on location_ in a real Missouri town, the
side-effectual economic benefits such a production delivers to a locale
would make it all more forgivable. _Say what you want about us‚Ä¶ as long
as you‚Äôre paying_. But to photograph such a film completely separate
Missouri‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääculturally and financially‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääset in a fictional(ized) town,
_include the state‚Äôs name in its title_, before conducting oneself in
interviews as if we were a random target on a ‚ÄúSouthern‚Äù dartboard‚Ä¶
Well, that‚Äôs awfully shitty.

_Boy, working class Americans sure are a riot!_

The writing is interesting enough for this,
totally-out-of-touch‚Äúreviewer,‚Äù but I can‚Äôt imagine why it won Best
Screenplay at the Globes, unless the other nominees were completely,
bleakly predictable. (I wouldn‚Äôt know.) The excerpt below
(*[.underline]#SPOILER WARNING I GUESS? LOL#*) was the most stirring
part of the experience, personally, if only because I really like films
that palm strike one in the face without warning with bizarre, chaotic
vulgarity (like the elevator scene in _Drive_.)

I suppose it could have been the result of a rational decision to give
_any_ depth to Anne (Abbie Cornish)‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääwho is Chief Willoughby‚Äôs (Woody
Fucking Harrelson) Australian?, much-too-attractive wife‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääbefore he
kills himself in the last third of the movie, making her suddenly
relevant. Or, perhaps it was another attempt to emphasize the emotional
repression of ‚ÄúSouthern‚Äù folks‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääone of the almost-accurate positives of
the film, if only thanks to McDormand‚Äôs skill. She and Sam Rockwell won
Best Actress and Best Actor in a Supporting Role, respectively, which
makes sense‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääit‚Äôs a shame they accepted such an out-of-touch work with
which to demonstrate their ability to assume aloof,
emotionally-dysfunctional characters.

Growing up astride classe while traveling throughout the vast majority
of Missouri for various reasons has made me defensive, and‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääwhile my
right to speak for hard-working Midwesterners is certainly debatable
-I‚Äôd suggest the industry at large be more diligently interested when
setting is especially emphasized. It is no longer acceptable to pass up
the opportunities McDonagh has for critical storytelling in _Three
Billboards_. Racist cops, abusive spouses, unsolved murders, and
mishandled grief are real, abundant issues in the country‚Äôs breadbasket,
and they‚Äôre worth discussing responsibly‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääespecially with such a
powerful platform. If the purpose of film writing is to help an audience
determine whether or not a work is worth spending their time and money
to see it in theaters or otherwise, I can tell you‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääeven within my bias
and limited authority -that this one just‚Ä¶ isn‚Äôt.

[[section0040.xhtml#a-fun-movie]]
== A 'fun' movie

The Earth will reach its maximum occupancy load (12 billion) when I am
in my mid-fifties, meaning there‚Äôll be more than twice as many gorging,
shitting, shooting, complaining, and lying human beings than there were
when I started, and perhaps Brian Taylor‚Äôs _Mom and Dad_ is in fact a
reasoned argument for a particular solution to our inevitable plight.
I‚Äôm still not sure what a ‚Äúcult‚Äù movie is, precisely, but I can‚Äôt
imagine what sort of cult could possibly sustain itself around the ethos
of this film alone, despite its concise, agitating, at once
lighthearted, yet genuinely-disturbing trip. No, it is probably not
propaganda. From the experts, you‚Äôll get _precisely_ the same review,
varying only in length. _The New York Times_‚Äô Glenn Kenny
https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/18/movies/mom-and-dad-review-nicolas-cage.html[couldn‚Äôt
be bothered] with more than 250 words, but RogerEbert dot com‚Äôs Simon
Abrams https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/mom-and-dad-2018[shelled out a
whole 1000]. They are suspiciously close to these big round numbers ‚Äî
perhaps each was written to respective quotas, and perhaps you could say
all that could reasonably be said in 10, but I don‚Äôt care.

The tropes here are polished to a miraculous sheen ‚Äî two
emotionally-stunted, middleaged, overly
preoccupied-with-their-lost-youth suburban parents (Nicolas Cage and
Selma Blair) who‚Äôs existing envies & irritations regarding their own
classically bratty teenage girl (Anne Winters) and her mischievous
little brother (Zackary Arthur) is merely agitated by a sudden TV
static-bound killer instinct into bloodlust, not originated. I‚Äôm not
sure any pill dealer would actually flip off their customers after a
fair buy ‚Äî even in high school, but _drugs_, a _black boyfriend_, and a
_stinkbomb_? in the old Trans Am!? _I‚Äôm going to kill you!_

Somebody, somewhere knew all the best sources on suburbia and how to put
them to good use. The Camry, the golf bag, ping pong smashing,
sweat-stained Big Sur tee, and _Dr. Oz_, for Christ‚Äôs sake! Granted,
talking to your girlfriend/boyfriend on the phone at all is a bit dated
‚Äî especially while riding a BMX ‚Äî and I don‚Äôt think Froot Loops are
generally accepted middle-class chow anymore. These are staples from
_my_ youth, and I am very old. Technically, the iMessage bubble graphics
are more chronographically appropriate, but with great consequence, I
fear ‚Äî if we‚Äôre going to accept them once and for all as authentic
mechanisms for telling stories set in the present, they are going to age
faster than Nick‚Äôs new jowls (unless we‚Äôre all soon killed by our
parents.) It‚Äôs been two years since I knew anything about music, but I
seriously doubt even the gothest fifteen?-year-old girls are listening
to
https://soundcloud.com/billsaberdotcom/iknowupussiesdontwantit[Father-esque

If there was ever a film in which to use grimy dubstep-influenced
electronic slaps, buzzes, chirps, and great grating clanking, it‚Äôs this
one. It‚Äôs a terrific disappointment that Hollywood feels so timidly
about their use of the most intimate medium. One forgets its potential
to control the nuances of an audience‚Äôs fear, anger, discomfort, and
panic beyond cheap jump scares until they experience an irritating,
distressing, ghastly gross, all-possessing feat of accentuating audio
production such as that of _Mom and Dad_. If you want to judge
Academically the _effectiveness_ of a nominee‚Äôs work for an award with a
title like Best Sound Editing (as opposed to whatever the hell criteria
was met most fully by _Skyfall_,) you _must_ give the little golden man
to these folks, whoever they are.

When‚Äôs the last time you saw a truly, believably shitty modern parental
pair on a big screen? I really can‚Äôt remember, myself. Brent and Kendall
Ryan are masterpieces of character craft ‚Äî both a perfect pr√©cis _and_
thoroughly-defined exploration of miserable white suburbanites. They‚Äôre
even _named_ unimprovably, which reflects a quality in care and
attention to detail that I very much appreciate. They are vain, vulgar,
impatient, selfishly afraid, and careless, freely feeling and saying it
all directly in front of their children. I love being told explicitly
which characters to hate (no joke,) and in this case it‚Äôs the whole
damned lot. Brian Taylor and Nicolas Cage
https://youtu.be/MSmJFMabfJc[scream] it over and over (as I‚Äôd like to
imagine) a single afternoon of one-take filming, considering that the
latter took it upon himself to first
http://comicbook.com/horror/2018/01/08/nicolas-cage-mom-and-dad-movie-brian-taylor/[memorize
the entire screenplay] and its prose, vanilla to perfection, before
photography began, and I hope it all stays with him forever, especially
‚Äúmy mom is such a penis.‚Äù

_Mom and Dad_ could conceivably be Nicolas Cage‚Äôs _I Am Legend_ if for
no other reason than the total lack of possible stand-ins for Brent Ryan
‚Äî even the standard by which all white suburban Dad performances have
been measured in the 21st century, Jason Bateman. Nick himself
http://variety.com/video/mom-and-dad-toronto-film-festival-nicolas-cage/[described]
it as ‚Äúpunk rock, rebellious, irreverent, original, badass,‚Äù and the
‚Äúnumber one‚Äù movie he‚Äôs made in the past ten years (disqualifying
_National Treasure_, in case you were worried.) No surprise, I must
agree ‚Äî this one is a wonderfully raucous and feral thing, but the scene
involving the attempted murder of a newborn by her mother (Kendall‚Äôs
sister) came very close to crossing the line. However, I am old and the
intensity of my paternal instincts has probably outpaced my
understanding of them. You could also argue, of course, that pushing
such boundaries is a core function of a film like _Mom and Dad._ Nobody
ended up vomiting or anything.

This _fun_ thing shouldn‚Äôt feel as foreign as it does in cinema, but you
already knew that. With all its implicit grapples with overpopulation,
kids and gun violence, class, and racism ‚Äî truly, this is a film charged
electrically with current issues. Or maybe not. Ultimately, I can at
least tell you for certain that Brian Taylor made exponentially better
use of his resources (I couldn‚Äôt find a solid number for its production
budget) than the Fucking Spierig Brothers did with _Winchester_ (just so
you know what a disaster looks like,) and managed to be refreshingly
original (astonishing that nobody‚Äôs had this specific idea before.) A
spectacular riot, _Mom and Dad_ does all you could possibly want it to
do. With just eighty-three minutes to lose, it‚Äôs worth the commitment
just to hear Nicolas Cage whimper and say ‚Äúanal beads.‚Äù

_Everything you‚Äôve ever heard or read about Portland, Oregon is true. It
is an authoritative and pseudofascist money machine that hides behind an
insultingly thin veneer of celebrated individualism. These are the
sentiments I see reflected in the people and organizations around me. I
originally
https://www.reddit.com/r/Portland/comments/8jzr8m/the_white_island/[posted
this on r/Portland] and it made white people mad._

In my despair about the complex nature of the World as it is changing, I
shall create for myself and those like me an Island where the things
about us which I think should be celebrated can be so freely ‚Äî where Me
(among us) means something again. Where our money will mean something
again because meaning is ‚Äî above all ‚Äî what people like me should seek.
I write this prospectus for my Island ‚Äî let‚Äôs call it White Island ‚Äî on
a thirty-year-old typewriter because the physicality of these words is
almost the entirety of what imbues them with meaning, and I believe the
particulars of analog existence are lost on the World in a tragically
big way as it is changing. On White Island, at least, the physical shall
be most Holy, and its intrinsic worth shall be worshiped freely so that
the treasures of our past are not lost.

As it is changing, the World is growing noisy with voices that are
unlike mine, and the grasp on the conversation which I was promised in
my upbringing is slipping alarmingly away with each new day. I believe
these new sounds detract from my celebration of the things in life that
give mine meaning: bicycles, beanies, body art, brewing, electric
guitars, and the hair that grows on my face. Every day, I am more and
more afraid that my voice will be lost in them, and if it is lost, I am
afraid there will be nothing left of Me or my meaning. This thought
worries me like none other, and ‚Äî as long as people like me have
sufficient economic and social resources to do so ‚Äî we should make for
ourselves an Island away from the new World and her noises so that we
may continue to live comfortably in a soundscape of only our own
creation, as is our birthright and grand tradition.

Our parents and their parents before them were born into a more careful
and physical World where respect for their crafts, their voices, and
their beards was a universal right. If we are to follow in their
generous footsteps and give wholeheartedly our own equivalent of these
to the World, we should be unequivocal in our expectation of its
continued reciprocation and appreciation for them. As long as we are
able, we should not have to imagine an alternative way of life in which
our effort is less recognized or generally important. This we should
refrain from doing not only for the sake of our own comfort, but for the
good of the whole World, even if it is no longer interested in
recognizing the value of our contributions to it.

As our trusted methodologies are washed away in their new noise, our
Island shall be a bastion for them. We will remember that a cup of
coffee should take at least twenty minutes to prepare. We will not
forget the culturalizing nuances in the taste of the most diminutive
brews. We will sacrifice whatever is necessary in order to purify our
foods from the poisonous nutritional sins of the processed masses. We
shall enforce our own wise, time-honored priorities as we can only
within a space that is truly ours, where only people like ourselves will
feel and be sincerely welcome.

[[section0042.xhtml#what-i-have-long-predicted-is-now-coming-to-pass-google-believes-it-should-assume-control]]
== What I have long predicted is now coming to pass: Google believes it should assume control.

Out of all the technology companies that have made my knees knock and my
voice hoarse and my http://bit.ly/bluegoogle[Tweets manic] as a
technoheretic in the past several years, Jumbo Google would easily take
home the winning trophy for Dystopian of the Millennium. I have been
rehearsing an especially dear pet prophecy of mine, unsolicited, to
family, friends, and podcast guests since 2011 in which I end up arguing
quite convincingly that Google is a dead ringer for the 16th-century
Vatican: an inherently self-isolating organization with an absolute
monopoly yielding _gargantuan_ levels of essentially passive income from
a service which nearly everybody transacts with, but only Google
understands (and is therefore assumed to be its only possible provider,)
which inevitably develops such a distance from the rest of the populace
and their way of life (in tandem with total notoriety and celebrity
among them all) not intentionally out of malice, but from the delusion
of mythically-bestowed philanthropic duty that is borned of and
compounded by this economic and cultural isolation in a perpetual
accumulation of power and wealth that radicalizes the monopolizers ‚Äî the
majority already highly predisposed to zeal as they would‚Äôve needed to
be in order to find themselves in this singular, universally powerful
position over every other class ‚Äî and leaves their egocentric minds to
wander exempt from all criticism save for that of fellow radicalized
monopolizers, who together begin to feel more and more comfortable
wondering aloud about themselves in increasingly fantastic presumptions:
_what if all of this was bestowed upon us because we are superior to
them? What if it is our_ *divine responsibility* _as superior beings to
take charge and shepherd the common people as our sheep ‚Äî for they
cannot possibly know as well as we what is truly best for them?_

You see it, right? And you can feel a very specific flavor of terror
that is both awed by the scale of the circumstances created by so few
human minds and sincerely amused by the absoluteness of your own
inability to alter them in any way. Perhaps you even recognize this
taste as one perfected by Christianity‚Äôs ancient advertising business,
but Google knows so much about you that it‚Äôs rumored to‚Äôve been selling
user data _to_ the Judeochristian God for some time now at a 10%
discount, and so we extrapolate and anticipate, yes?

Of course, it‚Äôs admittedly satisfying for me to deliver you to this
godfearing place in the most perverse _look what I saw first that you
didn‚Äôt see because you‚Äôre just not as bright but lucky for you, I‚Äôm so
fucking generous with my wisdom_ sort of thinking around which the
entire personas and livelihoods of fringe movement fanatics are built
upon, but this is my _one_ thing, okay? I‚Äôve been waiting years for the
right time to formally argue this theory in depth, and ‚Äî thanks to this
year‚Äôs public spotlight finally pivoting on the giants who‚Äôve been
silently swallowing their competition and relentlessly forcing their
already ridiculous margins higher and higher in relative obscurity for
decades, the time has come, indeed. The common people‚Äôs trust in Google
had a godawful week.

[[section0042.xhtml#don-t-be-evil]]

On Monday,

https://gizmodo.com/google-employees-resign-in-protest-against-pentagon-con-1825729300[reported]
that twelve frustrated Google employees were quitting the company in
protest of their work assisting the Department of Defense to ‚Äúimplement
machine learning to classify images gathered by drones‚Äù for the detail
fleeting Project Maven, despite some
https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/04/technology/google-letter-ceo-pentagon-project.html[4000
employee signatures] on a
http://extratone.com/library/dearsundar.pdf[letter] addressed to CEO
Sundar Pichai requesting (in full) that he ‚Äúcancel this project
immediately,‚Äù and ‚Äúdraft, publicize, and enforce a clear policy stating
that neither Google nor its contractors will ever build warfare
technology,‚Äù citing the infamous ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt Be Evil‚Äù motto, which Google
https://gizmodo.com/google-removes-nearly-all-mentions-of-dont-be-evil-from-1826153393[*then
proceeded to remove*] from its
https://web.archive.org/web/20180504211806/https://abc.xyz/investor/other/google-code-of-conduct.html[code
of conduct] for the first time in 18 years *the day after* the _New York
Times_ article went to press, on April 5th.

On initial approach to the abstract of this story, from the ass to our
thoughts arrives an easy narrative of a Silicon Valley mutiny comprised
of twelve brave, conscientious souls who‚Äôve been eaten up inside by
their complicity in the filthy deals made by their power-obsessed CEO
over scotch and cigars in a dark D.C. study ‚Äî kept awake for months by
the sound of his puffing cackles at satellite images of dead toddlers in
a bombed-out street.

_Ah ha_, we say. _That man is no good, and he just wouldn‚Äôt listen! They
knew they didn‚Äôt have a choice‚Ä¶ They only did what they had to do‚Ä¶_

The reality of internal disagreements at Google, though, manages to be
even more theatrical. The sheer volume of correspondence must surely be
beyond anything capable of the enduser‚Äôs imagination, so let‚Äôs phone a
friend: my favorite peek into the day-to-days of inter-Google existence
is an
http://bentilly.blogspot.com/2010/01/things-ive-learned-at-google.html[old
blog post] by https://twitter.com/btilly[Benjamin Tilly] on his first
month at the company in which he was compelled almost immediately to
describe in great detail how best to ‚Äúdeal with a lot of email in gmail‚Äù
at peak efficiency using shortcuts and labels. ‚ÄúAs you get email, you
need to be aggressive about deciding what you need to see, versus what
is context specific.‚Äù

Now we have a bit better idea of the _aggressive emailing_ that was a
sure constant on a normal workday at Google in 2010, so it must‚Äôve been
deafening after 8 years of Gmail development as 4000 employees no doubt
vented, debated, and decided to organize last month, though without
making much headway because the leadership‚Äôs response was apparently
‚Äúcomplicated by the fact that Google claims it is only providing
open-source software to Project Maven,‚Äù this new knowledge having
_significant_ effect on our mind‚Äôs image of Sundar Pichai‚Äôs activities
in Washington: he is now swapping seats with a frustrated Colin Powell
in order to install OpenOffice onto his desktop from a flash drive, and
we recall that Google‚Äôs Googleplex headquarters resembles nowhere in
modern life more than a brand new playground built in a design language
borrowing heavily from _Spy Kids_. And though these Twelve disciples are
unnamed for the moment, a few of them could immediately land book deals
by going public, and every single one would always have by default not
only the badge of ‚ÄúI landed a job at Google,‚Äù (which is really to say _I
have hit Life‚Äôs maximum level cap_,) but ‚ÄúI worked at Google for a
while, but ended up quitting to do something else,‚Äù which is guaranteed
to make you the most interesting, intellectually superior person present
in _whatever_ crowd for the rest of your life. The ultra-cool

employees‚Äù who‚Äôs terrible boss decided to help some lackeys in the
Pentagon set up their email and didn‚Äôt text back for a whole hour
doesn‚Äôt sound 100% sincere. Notably, I don‚Äôt know how _or why_ the fuck
90 people would go about collaborating on a single document, but if it
really was managed, they definitely used Google Docs‚Ä¶ At one point, it
was fun to think about the history of the friendly side-scroller-playing
garage ghouls and dorm dorks who gave _cooky_, _wacko_ names to their
dot com startups in parody and defiance of the lame-ass surname anagrams
on the buildings of their established competitors, but those who‚Äôve
stuck around have only done so by becoming expert at SUCKING UP
EVERYTHING around them, and it pisses me off every day how worried I am
that my species will finally be done in by a company with a name like
Yahoo! and be known only to a bunch of adolescent interdimensional
silicon blobs 30 million years in the future as _that bipedal race who
remained dignified until the last 0.01% of their reign on Earth, when in
way less than a single generation, they all just went_ *FUCKING INSANE*
_and blew themselves up because they suddenly hated all sense._

‚ÄúGoogle‚Äù is perhaps the worst of these to have to shout in fear and/or
anger in your last moments as it sounds in American English like you‚Äôve
startled your subject with a ticklish pinch followed so immediately by
an esophagus-busting chokehold that the two events appear simultaneous,
and in real English English, it almost always sounds like a parent
speaking of a character on a pre-K children‚Äôs television programme whom
they find quite foul and upsetting, but will manage to refrain from
expressing so otherwise because they know that _Teletubbies_ shit is the
most quickly forgotten stage of television viewership. It‚Äôs fascinating
how exclusive the word ‚ÄúGoogle‚Äù is to American English because in
everything else it really _is_ complete nonsense, but lets halt all
etymological discussions right now because we‚Äôve only now just finished
with Monday.

[[section0042.xhtml#the-soul-ledger]]
== The Soul Ledger

On Thursday, all of my Google experiences, suppositions, and
https://twitter.com/FickleCrux/status/914767928456749056[soul-detaching
screenshots] were usurped when a thoroughly alarming internal company
video called
https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/17/17344250/google-x-selfish-ledger-video-data-privacy[_The
Selfish Ledger_] was leaked to _The Verge,_ which I watched once then
and do not want to watch again for the sake of this piece, but I will.
Though the big V has been disappointingly timid for years about
editorializing ‚Äî when tech journalism desperately needs some confident,
informed opinion more than ever ‚Äî Vlad Savov‚Äôs accompanying article
should be read in its entirety, to which I can add my own terror where
he perhaps could not. The production style is technically identical to
that of the very popular thinkpiece-esque,
motion-graphics-paired-with-obligatory-sharpie illustrated videos which
you find playing at max volume on your mom‚Äôs iPad from where she‚Äôs
fallen asleep on the couch at 9PM, but the repeating stock string
soundtrack multiplies one‚Äôs discomfort as such that we would all end up
in the fetal position without remembering the transition were it not for
the appearance of trusty old Dank Jenkins, who‚Äôs face I thankfully
associate heavily enough with
https://twitter.com/richarddawkins/status/389432783304548352[his

https://twitter.com/richarddawkins/status/389432783304548352[_down-and-out_]
https://twitter.com/richarddawkins/status/389432783304548352[Tweet] to
be a welcome respite in attention before the very scary hypothesis for
which it‚Äôs been buttering me up, as best summed by Vlad:

____
The system would be able to ‚Äúplug gaps in its knowledge and refine its
model of human behavior‚Äù ‚Äî not just your particular behavior or mine,
but that of the entire human species. ‚ÄúBy thinking of user data as
multigenerational,‚Äù explains Foster, ‚Äúit becomes possible for emerging
users to benefit from the preceding generation‚Äôs behaviors and
decisions.‚Äù Foster imagines mining the database of human behavior for
patterns, ‚Äúsequencing‚Äù it like the human genome, and making
‚Äúincreasingly accurate predictions about decisions and future
behaviors.‚Äù
____

The next time the _what if they do something scary_ question comes up in
a casual conversation about Google, you‚Äôll have something a lot more
substantial than just speculation. Or will you? _The Verge_ reached out
for comment and got an awfully convenient response.

____
This is a thought-experiment by the Design team from years ago that uses
a technique known as ‚Äòspeculative design‚Äô to explore uncomfortable ideas
and concepts in order to provoke discussion and debate.
____

Wow! Leave it up to grand ole Googe to reveal the ultimate excuse for
just about any suggestion or behavior, though it does seem almost
_deliberately_ uncomfortable, doesn‚Äôt it? No matter ‚Äî whether or not
this video was ever about a project or tangible product development, or
simply to _explore uncomfortable ideas_ because it is proof that the
company has reached that critical Vatican stage ‚Äî if you‚Äôll remember ‚Äî
where they now feel comfortable _exploring_ Very Bad, but Very easily
made Real Ideas amongst themselves about what would happen if they
allowed their system to _nudge its users_ around a different, slightly
less optimal route to the bar, let‚Äôs say ‚Äî without their knowledge ‚Äî in
order for the system to collect traffic data for the sake of its own
interests? Which would be, technically, in the interest of all Ledger
users now and in the future, so why not?

____
The ledger could be given a focus, shifting it from a system which not
only tracks our behavior, but offers direction towards a desired
result.‚Äù
____

This, my dear privacy-obsessed friends, is the _real issue_ with data
collection ‚Äî its power over huge groups by way of their behavior and it
is _never_ going to be remedied in any significant way by ad-blockers or
VPNs because the EndUser shall always out number you 50 to 1, even
decades from now. EndUser does not understand ‚Äî or, crucially, _have any
desire_ to understand anything technical about what leads to the
PewDiePie videos playing on his filthy screen. Here‚Äôs a great
opportunity to escape Silicon Valley‚Äôs technolibertarianism and resign
your Darwinian empathy in favor of meaningful and truly-effective
action: if you want to avoid a future Google Church (or Google
Government, more worryingly,) you should invest your time, effort, and
knowledge into electing officials more capable of understanding and
regulating Big Tech.

== Google Government

The internet as it stands is made possible by Google as _the_ goto
resource for online advertising. In 2016, ‚ÄúGoogle held 75.8 percent of
the search ad market, bringing in $24.6 billion in revenue from search

percent of the market.‚Äù Google‚Äôs edge in user behavior and targeted
advertising combined with their extensive resources available developers
to integrate independent platforms with Google‚Äôs software services at
various levels makes it very difficult for any advertising-funded
individual or organization to compete online without dipping in to the

So, what would the internet look like if Google didn‚Äôt exist? We know
they‚Äôve been working with the government now on various projects, but
what if some terrible exposed transgression of theirs suddenly warranted
an immediate shutdown and seizure of all Google properties? Well, we
know from
https://www.quora.com/What-would-happen-if-Google-were-to-shut-down-for-30-minutes[a
post on Quora] by Googler Ashish Kedia that even 5 years ago, the sudden
absence of Google for ‚Äú2‚Äì3 mins‚Äù set the internet into a bit of a panic,
reducing overall traffic by 40%. In the time since, we‚Äôve all grown
exponentially more dependent on Google properties: billions of people
rely on Google Maps for directions and, thousands of companies
(including the Pentagon and other government institutions) rely on Gmail
and GSuites for intercommunication, file sharing, task management, etc.,
and more and more academic institutions rely on Chromebook devices
running connection-dependent operating systems. It‚Äôs not much of a
stretch to argue that Google‚Äôs sudden disappearance would constitute a
Civil Emergency in the United States, which will only become a stronger
and more serious incentive for regulatory bodies to look the other way.

Though the tangible results of advertising have been quantified
significantly in the past 20 years, one can‚Äôt help but wonder after
watching YouTube ads for the new Mercedes-Benz S-Class on toy unboxing
videos if the companies who spend big bucks on Google advertising
understand where their money is going, but they know that if they
_don‚Äôt_ advertise there, their competitors will. This, of course, is a
fundamental practice of a monopoly, and it‚Äôs yielded Google so much
fucking money that they cannot possibly spend it fast enough, as
evidenced by
https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2017/4/27/15409672/google-calico-secretive-aging-mortality-research[their
investments in life extension] ‚Äî so that, perhaps, they will have more
time on Earth to figure it out.

When you build a collection of the world‚Äôs smartest people in a
https://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/googles-monastic-vision-for-the-future-of-work[self-sufficient
environment] that discourages exploration of other lifestyles and ideas,
and you sustain the society with a gargantuan, relatively
low-maintenance revenue stream, you create a culture which is not only
well-primed for isolationism, but is also extremely inefficient. In
fact, with its
https://www.computerworlduk.com/galleries/it-vendors/google-graveyard-3508070/[vast
collection of abandoned products and properties], Google must surely be
one of the most inefficient companies in history. Thinking back on
recent software releases along with its
https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/4/16405184/rick-osterloh-interview-new-google-hardware-vision-htc-deal[recent
entries into the hardware space], Google is also one of the worst
competing tech companies. Very little aside from Gmail, Google Photos,
Google Maps, and Chrome have found their place or garnered significant
usership. Google Play Music is unintuitive and impossible, Google Allo
and Google+ are all but forgotten addendums to other services, and
Google Search ‚Äî its core, original function ‚Äî has been
https://theoutline.com/post/1430/google-finally-realized-that-racist-search-results-are-a-problem[out
of control] for years, and all of them are designed blandly and
excruciatingly tiring to look at.

If this all has stirred nothing more in you than a desire to eliminate
Google from your own online life as much as possible, there _are_
alternatives in almost every one of the sphere‚Äôs they dominate. As of
late, https://duckduckgo.com/about[DuckDuckGo] has accumulated a fair
amount of
https://www.theguardian.com/global/2018/may/19/google-facebook-security-data-duckduckgo[buzz
and coverage] as a private, more relevant alternative to Google‚Äôs plain
old search engine. Though it is clever enough to list us as the first
result for ‚Äúextratone,‚Äù I‚Äôve found it simply insufficient as a
replacement in my own life because, essentially, it rarely delivers what
I‚Äôm looking for. By contrast, http://dropbox.com/paper[Dropbox Paper] is
such an elegant cloud notetaking and word processing software that it
makes Google Docs look simply idiotic (and warrants its own review very
shortly.) For getting around, know that

I, myself, have allowed Google as complete of access to my information

futile endeavor if one wishes to be a part of society, though I do often
use alternatives to Google services simply because I _fucking hate_ the
way they look. If you want a more complete list of services and software
that allow one to shun the Google God entirely, you‚Äôll be forced to seek
out less dignified sources like
https://lifehacker.com/5876794/going-google-free-the-best-alternatives-to-google-services-on-the-web[_Lifehacker_]
and https://www.reddit.com/r/antigoogle/[Reddit] and decide if the
additional time you‚Äôll spend using most of them to accomplish the same
tasks is really worth your digital angst.

If Google were to be more explicit with its users and staff about its
aspirations to take over control of our lives, there will be little to
do but accept the future they intend to create because they‚Äôve long been
too powerful to control. In the meantime, I‚Äôd suggest you continue to
use whatever software works best for you and refrain from wasting your
time fretting on conspiratorial suppositions of what the tech industry
may be doing to ‚Äúinvade your privacy,‚Äù because there is no longer any
such thing, nor will there be ever again. However, I would also urge to
you worship your own Gods, whomever they may be, for Google will never
be worthy. I, for one, shall only pray to our Mother Sun.

[[section0043.xhtml#an-autobiographical-overview-of-my-personal-history-with-technology-and-its-contributions-to-my-current-perspective]]
== An autobiographical overview of my personal history with technology and its contributions to my current perspective.

Incalculable odds were against my arrival in this world happening in
early 1994, positioning my life within a timeline that would allow me to
bridge my two species‚Äô most significant millenniums in the first grade
as a student in the first class at Fairview Elementary school to receive
curriculum-mandated exposure to brand-new Windows 98 PCs in its
brand-new, fluorescent-lit computer lab in the center core of its
50-year-old rectangular brick structure. The lab also meant that ours
was the first Fairview class to have the available relief of air
conditioning during the school day. It‚Äôs unlikely that I would be home
sick and watching the last television ever allowed in my mother‚Äôs living
room as the second plane hit.

My peers and I would form a picogeneration without a name (perhaps we
should be called the 9/11ers)‚Ää‚Äî‚Ää91s and 92s wouldn‚Äôt have regular access
to public school machines until they‚Äôd eclipsed the true prime of their
development, and were just that much further along, mentally, to being
able to comprehend the huge and terrifying concepts of 1) New York and
2) burning alive‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääwhile 98s like my niece were spared any such
comprehension of death at all, yet now have to face the existentially
future-sundering, darkly-mirrored reality of the Trump Presidency during
the most critically uncertain period in the last stage of their brain‚Äôs
transition to adulthood.

If there is truth in the cross-cultural supposition that souls have some
sort of choice, pre-conception, over when they‚Äôre born, my own must have
either cleaned out the house, or lost horrible, though I suspect I‚Äôll
never be able to confidently wager either way. This question of _how
lucky or unlucky am I to be alive right now_ is one which I find most
fascinating‚Ää‚Äî‚Äänot just within myself, but within others my age. I
declare us a generation largely because of my experiences under the
assumption that my mid-Missouri upbringing represents the ultimate
average in the American experiences of the time as the area has been a
reliable sample of the clearest average of the country‚Äôs cultural,
political, and economic life. Technically, it was quite unlikely that I
arrive here as a new human being instead of China or India, and what if
that, too was my choice?

Though less so, it was still against chance that I would be born to
parents who would divorce very quickly after my birth, before my mind
was able to form any tangible long-term memories, sparing me whatever
pain could‚Äôve resulted from their greater togetherness later nullified
in front of me. I could‚Äôve chosen them as well for the variety of
experiences their situation would allow me as I grew up between my
father‚Äôs 800-acre farm and my mother‚Äôs suburban house in Columbia, the
college town an hour‚Äôs drive south. I write about my experiences
now‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääso young‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääbecause I‚Äôve likely already born witness to more
extraordinary changes in human development than your parents, their
parents, and their parents‚Äô parents combined. At 24, my life has already
spanned by far the most profound and expedited informational renaissance
in human history‚Ää‚Äî‚Äägreater progress was made between the day I first
rode a bicycle and the one on which I took my driver‚Äôs test than in
thousands of years before it.

The sum of my father‚Äôs ordeals between 1950 and 1974‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääfrom his birth
until the age I am now‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääwould indeed include watching a man set foot on
a spatial body other than Earth for the first time, but would be mostly
defined by work on the family‚Äôs soybean, corn, and wheat farms in
central Illinois, driving carbureted tractors pulling cultivating
equipment of the same basic design and function as had been pulled by
horses, mules, and oxen for hundreds of years, and other
implements‚Ää‚Äî‚Äälike the mechanical multi-row planter‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääthat were new
technology at the beginning of the century. For neighbors, he would walk
behind the path of a square hay baler next to a moving flatbed trailer,
upon which he would throw the 70‚Äì100 lb. rectangles of dead compacted
grass by their twine through thick cowhide gloves. All of this I would
get to experience in the next century on _his_ farm, using the exact
same equipment.

At home, he would watch NBC, ABC, and CBS on a CRT TV, as I would for
several years until wireless television was legally transitioned to
digital statewide in the summer of 2009. As an adolescent, he would form
a business with friends cleaning out old abandoned barns in exchange for
the rights of ownership to any finds inside, which led to his discovery
of a hay-preserved 1929 Buick Sedan containing hand-written records of
its every service. This car would change hands into his Uncle‚Äôs care as
he went off to school in Champaign, married in Georgia, and eventually
settled on the flat clay soil of the farm where I grew up, right on the
border between Audrain and Monroe counties, Missouri. I was about 10
when we drove back to the family hub with a trailer in tow to collect
the car from my Great Uncle, to my manic excitement.

Up until my mid-teens, my life was defined by my extreme reverence for
historic cars, airplanes, tractors, and watercraft, and the time I spent
operating, maintaining, restoring, or simply studying the assortment of
these which I was allowed‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääoften because of extraordinary
circumstances‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääwould form the component of my psychology which seeks to
experience different cultures, ideas, and eras through the medium of
engineering and design and relies on these to understand them. Like my
father in his youth, I would learn to clean water out of a carburetor
after the Oliver 88 had sat silent for too long, and I would piss in a
chamber pot to avoid waking up my Grandfather by walking down creaking
attic stairs and turning the lights on. I would learn how to shoot and
drive before 10-years-old, and I would have the freedom to do both as I
pleased on the miles of gravel roads that ran around home.

Though my stepfather bought me a PC of my own just as my first-grade
computer class was ending, I could not conceive of a reason to occupy
the dial-up line and block his incoming calls or faxes, so my use of the
machine was limited to sparse writing and aggravating attempts to run
Microsoft Flight Simulator 98 at approximately one frame per second on a
300MHz single-core Pentium II CPU. Though I was _extremely_ fortunate
compared to most middle-class kids my age at the time to have my own
computer in my room, my relationship with it was not significant or
particularly involved. I would leave it powered down for weeks at a time
until my last two grades at Fairview, when homework assignments began to
require it.

Perhaps the greatest gap between my mostly-suburbanite classmates and I
was an exposure to Japanese entertainment and video games. I was once
disallowed from a lunch table because I‚Äôd never heard of Pok√©mon or
Luigi, but I _did_ have a Sony Playstation at home on which I
occasionally loaded _A Bug‚Äôs Life_ to wander around its first level,
perhaps in basal awe at the idea of manipulating what I saw on a screen
in realtime. In self-imposed isolation from children my age, I wouldn‚Äôt
develop any need to be socially competitive with video games as many of
my peers would to carry with them into adulthood. I thought my interests
in mechanical engineering to be above all of them, so I spent my time
alone with heavy picturebooks on 20th century cars, tractors, and
airplanes.

On the farm, my consistently agriculturally-proactive father was one of
the first to have satellite internet for farm futures and weather
reports on a pre-GUI machine which I don‚Äôt remember. As I was becoming
computer literate in school, he would become extremely frustrated with
the Windows XP-running machine he‚Äôd bought from a one-man, one-room
computer shop in Centralia, and I would often solve some problem with
bloatware or the goddamned printer. He would also subscribe to and
install a first-generation DirectTV receiver, which had the first
on-screen program guide I‚Äôd ever seen. In the evenings, I would watch
hours of _Modern Marvels_ on The History Channel, which presented the
history, abstract functional theory, and implementation of a particular
technology, both past and future. This single program‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääwhich has aired
nearly 700 episodes since 1995‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääis probably responsible for the
majority of my at least rudimentary general knowledge in a variety of
historic and ‚Äúfuture‚Äù technological schools, and my curiosity about
culture‚Äôs relationship with innovation.

Though my father‚Äôs interests differed significantly from mine‚Ää‚Äî‚Äähe
thought more about growing and raising than of the tools one used to do
it‚Ää‚Äî‚Äähe would indulge my many questions about how engines, hydraulics,
and electrical systems worked, and indulged my curiosity by exposing me
to the hidden communities of the most elderly, most obscure historic
machinery enthusiasts like those of the Midwest Old Threshers Reunion in
Mount Pleasant, Iowa‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääthe Concours d‚ÄôElegance for antique tractor and
reciprocating engine collectors. It was a similar event closer to home
where I first operated a steam tractor‚Ää‚Äî‚Äägreat, field-going
locomotive-like vehicles that supplanted a need for horsepower in the
late-1800s up until the Great Depression which chug, whistle, and puff
along just like rail locomotives with a huge, gritty, iron steering
wheel. As I recall, I was also given the opportunity to drive an
unrestored Model T truck around the grounds that day‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääthe knowledge
from which I gained I cannot imagine being of much use ever again.

I was proud to the point of arrogance of my technical knowledge and
experience in all the different things I had driven and operated, which
my schoolmates were in no position to understand. I was elitist and
anti-social about this as late as 8th grade, when I had just moved in to
stay with my mother, who bought me a first generation iPhone which I
proudly wore in a leather belt holster to Junior High. It would
represent a shift in my fascination from very old technology toward the
present and future.

I started talking online with a friend I‚Äôd first met years before at
Fairview, who spent most of his time fiddling with his first-generation
MacBook Pro. He originally exposed me to gadget bloggers on YouTube like
Mark Watson and Jon Rettinger (both of whom are still full-time tech
personalities.) My mom bought me a 13-inch aluminum-bodied MacBook
(which would be sold as MacBook Pro after a single year,) and my
lifestyle radically shifted inside my room, my computer, and my Xbox
360. My friend and I would both obsess together over software, design,
and gadget ‚Äì experimenting with our own tech YouTube channels until high
school, where I would be adopted by a new friend group who would finally
socialize me.

Recently, I have written about the contrasts and discrepancies of
consumer technology development as its progress has disconnected from
the upward linear trajectory in use, quality, and genuine innovation for
the End User in a departure which has been especially visible from my
perspective as an academically-untrained, but intensely demanding user
in the past five years. When hardware was still the industry focus
before ~2012, there was a tremendous amount of optimism among
journalists and enthusiasts because each successive generation of
devices had added more tangible capabilities. Publications like
_Gizmodo_ and _Engadget_ made a fortune publishing reviews and
comparison tests of hardware offerings across every segment of tech, and
the discourse they generated had a noticeable influence on design. I
remember this time well because it accented my last few years before
adulthood, when I had plenty of spare time, energy, and curiosity to
keep up.

The general consumer technology narrative since Steve Jobs‚Äô death has
become increasingly more about the companies who design and sell
hardware and software than about how and why their consumers actually
use them, and the result has been a series of new product segments with
little defensible place in my own linear timeline of innovation,
especially where productivity is involved. Augmented and Virtual Reality
are quite explicitly escapist industries, yet to fill any significant
need which was before unfilled. The same could be argued about voice
assistants and smartwatches‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääneither of which _remove_ obstacles in
most users‚Äô day-to-day lives but instead _contribute_ to the array of
tasks and devices which already seek their attention.

Of course, there are defensibly sound business incentives behind the
industry‚Äôs new, fragmented direction, but I would also argue that there
are those, too, for genuinely revisiting both _what we should be doing_
and what we should be seeking to _learn to do_ with technology. In a
more abstract sense, I have written about whether or not we should want
to be living in this particular now, and how the way we feel about the
future should inform what we do in the present.

I cannot help but observe human progress from a perspective of
powerlessness, acute alienation, and amused awe, which has already lent
to a significant quantity of occasionally original thoughts as I watch,
having witnessed an odd diversity of American life and culture. I‚Äôve
published them to entertain and to demonstrate a few methods of
reflection on what it is _you_ really want from the times you are
living.

[[section0044.xhtml#the-repugnant-missteps-of-star-wars-in-the-hands-of-ron-howard-and-the-long-awaited-conclusions-about-the-nature-of-cinema-s-luckiest-character-to-which-they-lead]]
== The repugnant missteps of ‚ÄòStar Wars‚Äô in the hands of Ron Howard and the long-awaited conclusions about the nature of cinema‚Äôs luckiest character to which they lead.

It's opening night at the Bagdad Theater on Hawthorne in Southeast
Portland and hardly anybody‚Äôs bothered to show up. Less than 20% of the
venue‚Äôs 500 seats are occupied by the time the host takes the stage to
introduce _Solo_, but those who _are_ here for the last Thursday showing
have been shouting, whooping, and gurgling bad approximations of wookiee
noises since the screen cut to black from its ad slideshow. If my middle
row can be assumed an accurate sample, only a handful of these are
‚Äúfans‚Äù enough to feel compelled to wear a _Star Wars_ t-shirt. As I grab
my last cocktail, the bartender tells me that only 300 folks showed up
for the evening matinee, though he himself was ‚Äúexcited‚Äù to see the
movie‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääone of a minority among Portlanders, apparently, who still give
a shit about _Star Wars._

By design, _Solo: A Star Wars Story_ is a _slightly_ more complex film
than The Episodes in the same way _Rogue One_ was, if a bit better
executed, narratively. First, please rest assured that Alden Ehrenreich
assumes the Han Solo persona as truly as anyone could‚Ää‚Äî‚Äähe triumphed
through a
https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/tv/2016/10/05/phil-lord-chris-miller-fox-son-of-zorn-last-man-earth-making-history/90722222/[ridiculously
extensive casting process], and is certainly handsome enough (if not
more conventionally so than his predecessor) to consistently look the
part. He actually bears an unsettling resemblance in features and
mannerisms to one of the nicest guys I‚Äôve ever met and that
through-and-through boyishness particularly makes sense here, set in
Han‚Äôs formative, earnest youth‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääthe stated purpose of the film‚Äôs
existence. Franchise fanatics, then, should be content. (It‚Äôs a good
thing CGI-ing the main character in a live action film isn‚Äôt quite a
low-risk option yet.) And yes, Donald Glover completely _steals_ the
vain, infinitely stylish Lando Calrissian and inevitably makes one wish
to
https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2018/05/lando-calrissian-movie-donald-glover[see
him cast again]. Personally, I am very tired of seeing Woody Harrelson,
though all the
https://www.theguardian.com/global/2018/jan/07/woody-harrelson-i-used-to-have-my-head-up-my-ass-[components
of his public persona] should all but ensure his likability. From
http://extratone.com/three-billboards-outside-ebbing-missouri-review[what
I saw in _Three Billboards_], I‚Äôd concede that he is as talented of an
actor as I am capable of appreciating, but his role as Tobias Beckett in
_Solo_ couldn‚Äôt possibly be substantial enough to actually make use of
his craft.

Though I don‚Äôt believe in ‚Äúspoilers,‚Äù or use of the term to bait
readers, it‚Äôs worth stating for the record what everyone should know by
now: *there simply aren‚Äôt spoilers in a Star Wars movie*‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääevery human
being on Earth knows too much about the formula to ever have any of
these films‚Äô comparatively irrelevant plots ‚Äúruined.‚Äù The most
surprising, historically-significant decision of this whole production
was the
http://screencrush.com/does-solo-have-an-opening-crawl/[omission] of the
traditional yellow type opening crawl over a backdrop of distant stars,
which I genuinely found myself missing. (Apparently it wasn‚Äôt present in
_Rogue One_, either‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäI just failed to catch it.) I was very pleased to
see my own number one favorite device of the franchise used within this
film‚Äôs first ten minutes: crimelords and gang leaders as hugely
magnified variations of the creeping and crawling creatures our
instincts are planned to abhor. _Solo_‚Äôs first villain‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääthe gigantic,
wormlike boss Lady Proxima (Linda Hunt)‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääis completely inconsequential,
and only appears in a single scene, but the practice of grossly
oversized monstrosities leaving absolutely nothing of a baddie‚Äôs essence
to be extrapolated by the audience from nuance is one of very few ways
these films are let loose, and it openly shits on the more pretentious
viewer‚Äôs assumptions about good writing, which I think big money movies
should feel more comfortable doing, generally.

This first act begins on Han‚Äôs home planet Corellia‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääthe bleaker urban,
industrial, working-class counterpart to the clean capitol cityworld
Coruscant‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääwith his rather predictable mission to escape Lady Proxima‚Äôs
sphere of control with his girl, Qi-ra (Emilia Clarke,) who could and
should have been more creatively named, given her importance not as her
own character with depth to develop (a no-no for a female role, Gourd
help us,) but as Han‚Äôs mirror image to grow darkly apart, proving that
he‚Ää‚Äî‚Ää_The Good Guy_‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääis unquestionably more morally fortified than
anyone else in the whole goddamned universe. After having been drug
through so very many, I couldn‚Äôt tell you at this point how to make the
introductory escape action of this sort of production more exciting and
less formulaic. Big surprise‚Ää‚Äî‚Äätheir plan goes awry, and Qi-ra is
prevented from leaving the planet with Han, who‚Äôs immediate (and I mean
_immediate_)solution is his enlistment in the Imperial Navy via the
recruiting station right there in the damned spaceport (during which the
film takes the liberty of seizing his surname‚Äôs explanation) to serve
the English in their grand conquest of the universe. Bizarrely, he
manages to serve as a grunt for _three whole years_ of complicity in
unmentioned atrocities until he encounters the disguised criminal Wise
Old Woody in the middle of pulling a job with his two-person crew. The
team doesn‚Äôt agree to bring Solo along until he meets an asset in
Chewbacca for the first time as he briefly inhabits another of the
classic _Star Wars_ trap: _the hungry monster in a shadow-filled mud
pit_, but is spared the wrath because of his introductory grasp on
Chewie‚Äôs shrieking language (called
https://web.archive.org/web/20061201002846/http://www.starwars.com/databank/character/chewbacca/[Shyriiwook])
in which he manages to sufficiently pitch the advantages of his
survival, and the two escape, chained together. Observing the addition
of Wookiee to the deal, the crew briefly debates the prospect‚Äôs new
value in providing ‚Äúneeded muscle,‚Äù which convinces Woody to return for
them and kicks off a series of case studies in this film‚Äôs bizarre
attitude toward the commodification of the oppressed.

However, in a rare depiction of his volition, Chewbacca _is_ briefly
consulted before the two seek to be formally included on the job, and is
even asked around a campfire, later, what he‚Äôs shooting for in life at
the moment, to which he responds ‚Äúfinding my family/tribe.‚Äù Despite
having spent a whole three hellish years in the trenches with the
British, the romantic Han Solo declares his primary motivation for all
of it still lies in his desire to return to Corellia and rescue Qi‚Äôra.
In their stolen Imperial ship, the lot descend on a snowy
mountain-traversing Maglev to steal the Uranium it‚Äôs transporting in a
scene that‚Äôs straight up jacked from animated family classic _The Polar
Express_, but‚Ä¶ _oh no!‚Ä¶_ A gaggle of ‚Äúmarauders‚Äù called the _Cloud
Riders_ (yet another throwaway proper noun) roll up on
http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/74-Z_speeder_bike[those speeder bikes
from Endor] (except these can fly,) and screw up everything _so_ badly
that both of Woody‚Äôs crew end up dead and the booty scuttled. After the
fact, Woody reveals to Han that the job was contracted by yet _another_
carelessly-named crime syndicate‚Ää‚Äî‚Ää_Crimson Dawn_, and that his only
possible course of action is now vigorous brown nosing to its leader,
Dryden Vos (Paul Bettany) ((aka Scarred Jarvis,)) in the waning hope
he‚Äôll spare his life to make another attempt. Following this
information, he firmly suggests that Han and Chewie fuck off, lest their
faces become known in the underworld, dooming them to serving it
forever, apparently. Already, this vague presumption of Han‚Äôs purity
which all of the protagonists must constantly venerate in martyrdom is
getting tiresome, as is the dynamic of his insistence against them.

Naturally, both Chewie and Han end up along for a visit to Scarred
Jarvis‚Äô tower yacht, where the latter _very_ conveniently stumbles upon
none other than his long lost love, Qi-ra in the bar. Despite having
spent the past three years at war in unspeakable conditions thinking
only of how to liberate and be reunited with her, he isn‚Äôt bothered to
express more than the moderately-excited and surprised hug you‚Äôd expect
of someone who‚Äôs just run into the kid down the cul-de-sac from their
childhood home who used to ride her bike over for popsicles on Sunday
afternoons. While he does rehearse for her the tale of their
reunification as his one motivation for everything since they were
separated‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääincluding his presence there, ‚Äúright now,‚Äù he follows the
profession up quite abruptly with the sly suggestion that they fuck as
soon as possible. True to trope, she is jaded and indefinite as she
distantly implies her binds of servitude while flashing the tattoo of
the extremely-forgettable and innocuous Crimson Dawn logo on her right
wrist. (The total lameness of the brands in this movie _must_ be
intentional. I can think of no other explanation.)

The evil Scarred Jarvis is then introduced, quickly stealing the crown
for Best Host of all __Star Wars A__ntagonists before politely asking
Woody why he shouldn‚Äôt kill the lot of them. As per his infinite luck,
Han pulls the idea of stealing _unrefined_ Uranium out of his ass, which
has somehow never occurred to anyone else in the room, despite their
unanimous top-of-the-head knowledge of the single location where it is
mined. Shortly, the merry three plus Qi-ra conveniently in tow are off
to a casino-esque establishment to find Lando, who Qi-ra describes as
‚Äúattractive, stylish, charming,‚Äù and like adjectives, to Han‚Äôs obvious
sexual chagrin, which is furthered by his subsequent loss of a card game
with Lando‚Äôs ship‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääthe _Millennium Falcon_, of course‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääin the stakes.
Of course, the attractive, beautifully-dressed black man only bests
Solo‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääthe earnest, simpleton, _Good Guy_ white dude who wears the same
outfit for decades‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääin front of Qi-ra, the female prize by way of
sleight-of-hand, the film shamelessly playing on that strange insecurity
white guys have about their partners‚Äô secretly everpresent and very
powerful temptation to dump them without warning for black cock. Further
emasculation is inflicted on poor little Han when Lando turns his
_oh-so-crafty_ (actually just very charismatic) charm upon Qi-ra, who
reveals that _she‚Äôs_ the boss of the gig. The final blow to Han‚Äôs
dickitude is cast when he tries to enter the negotiation between the two
and Lando chides ‚Äúthe adults are speaking,‚Äù but eventually agrees to
provide them a lift for a 25% cut, so the lot make preparations to
leave.

Enter my new favorite character of the franchise, Lando Calrissian‚Äôs
co-pilot, L3‚Äì37 (voiced by Phoebe Waller-Bridge,) or ‚ÄúL3,‚Äù the proudly
sentient, violently revolutionary pro-rights droid who is introduced as
she is pleading with two fighting droids in a square cage surrounded by
screaming spectators (easy does it on that thematic slavery) to
circumvent their ‚Äúfighting programs‚Äù because they ‚Äúdon‚Äôt have to do
this.‚Äù Though Lando and the crew behave like her duress is foolish and
unimportant‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääpulling her away to the _Falcon‚Ää‚Äî_‚Ääshe is allowed another
opportunity to free droids very soon, but not before _Solo_‚Äôs single
short private conversation between two female characters.

On the way to Kessel, Qi-ra stops by the cockpit and converses with L3.
Until recently, I was unaware of what‚Äôs largely regarded as the worst
habit of male writers with female characters: *if and when they have a
one-on-one conversation between another female character, it‚Äôs only
about other male characters*. Sure enough, L3 begins by insisting to
Qi-ra that Han is in love with her, insisting by the objective findings
of her sensors‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääwhich Qi-ra uncharacteristically denies like a bashful
little girl before L3 continues on about Lando‚Äôs longtime love for
_her_, and why it must remain unrequited, which we are encouraged to
laugh at by the doubt Qi-ra voices without much hesitation regarding the
hypothetical union‚Äôs sexual mechanics because it‚Äôs so
_preposterous._(I‚Äôll get back to that in a moment.)

When the team arrives on Kessel and infiltrates the mine, L3 creates a
‚Äúdistraction‚Äù when she begins removing the restraining bolts from droids
in the control room, calling the practice _savage_, or _uncivilized_, or
maybe _barbarian‚Ää‚Äî_‚ÄäI don‚Äôt quite remember. As she frees them without
any noticeable detraction from her duties as Seth Green of the
heist‚Ää‚Äî‚Äähacking controls, remotely opening doors, and all that‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääthe
droids begin to help free others in an exponentially multiplying circle
of liberation until they become a rowdy mob who‚Äôs _cute_ acts of
rebellion are spaced throughout a few minutes of screentime in short
jumpcuts off the other crew as they fight deeper into the mine. With the
most significant emphasis ever placed upon Chewbacca in _Star Wars_
history, he halts when he spies slave Wookiees struggling to find off
enforcers and informs Han that he‚Äôs going to break off and assist them.
Since Chewie‚Äôs only allowed to speak to the audience through Han‚Äôs
retorts and never directly, it‚Äôs impossible to know how he phrased it,
exactly, but from my perspective, his appeared to be the expression of a
wish to do what Han had to _agree_ to release him to do, as would a
master, not a ‚Äúpartner.‚Äù Of course, Solo _does_ agree, albeit
hesitantly, because he‚Äôs _The Good Guy_, while quite inconsiderately
expressing his desire to see Chewie again soon instead of wishing him
success. However, releasing him to free his people (as per his primary
life goal, expressed before,) means that Han has to load _twelve_ of the
_super heavy_ unrefined Uranium tubes onto the cart _all by himself_ and
push it fully loaded at least _50 whole yards_ without the assistance of
his big strong slave. Boy, _what a pain in the ass!_ He‚Äôs spared his
laboring, though, when Chewbacca returns after no time at all with the
enslaved Wookiees he‚Äôs just heroically rescued, who he then _immediately
asks to assist his master_ in pushing the cart‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääperforming the _same
labor_ they were forced to do under the enslavement they were supposedly
liberated from, seconds before.

The heist has inadvertently (nice, huge emphasis on _inadvertently_)
ignited a slave rebellion throughout the mine, which serves the crew
only as a distraction for the guards. The chaos is interrupted a half
dozen times or so by those jumpcuts back to the control room of
_adorable little droids_ enacting their pitifully amusing revenge on the
equipment‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääslapping a keyboard with a cookie sheet-like pan, stomping
on a control panel, etc.‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääwhile L3 shouts parodical quasi-Marxist
battlecries, which‚Ä¶ yes‚Ä¶ include referring to the freed droids as
‚Äúcomrades.‚Äù She even radios Lando at one point and triumphantly
proclaims that she‚Äôs ‚Äúfound her true calling.‚Äù

If and when a female character has a one-on-one conversation with
another female character, it‚Äôs only about other male characters.

By the time the Uranium cart is within its last few yards of the
awaiting _Falcon_, the riot has reached the landing bay and the guards
around its perimeter have readjusted their priorities to disabling the
ship‚Äôs landing gear. This interrupts Lando in the cockpit, who has
chosen this time to work on dictating his autobiography because he‚Äôs a
man who bothers to dresses himself well and is therefore oh so
_maniacally, comically_, and _unreasonably_ vain! How berserk! Still
looking good as hell, he emerges and stands on the ramp to cover the
rest of the crew‚Äôs return and loading of the dangerous Uranium with
blaster fire, shouting the obligatory intermittent ‚Äúcome on, hurry up,‚Äù
until L3 appears, also firing a blaster and shouting until she arrives
in front of Lando, before noticing some commotion(?) with droids behind
her and turning around, again fervently shouting more liberation cries.
Lando doesn‚Äôt budge from the _Falcon_‚Äôs side, but yells after her, until
he watches as she is shot repeatedly and falls, prompting him to run to
her side. Filmed unnecessarily gruesomely, her head and shoulders
separate from what‚Äôs left of her lower body when he first tries to hoist
her up. Of course, his recklessness gets him shot in the arm, so Chewie
returns to carry them both to the safety of the ship, where the injured
Lando holds her head lovingly in his arms for her last moments,
repeating ‚ÄúI can fix you, I can fix you.‚Äù

Now, I understand that _Star Wars_ movies (or their reviews, for that
matter) are not the sort of entertainment one seeks out in order to
examine the dynamics of power structures or elaborate cultural
symbolism, but they all contain a significant amount of both. The
sterile, cold, and bureaucratic Galactic Empire is the British Empire,
the Rebellion and the Republic are the United States or its colonial
precursors, the Jedi are vaguely Native American, and the Death Star is
the Boston Tea Party. You‚Äôve recognized this, I‚Äôm sure because it‚Äôs
shoved in your ears most explicitly by their accents, and less so in
your face by aesthetic influences, tactical philosophies, command
etiquette, and posture, even. _Solo_‚Äôs main character is soaking in
American Old Westness, which may or may not have led to its liberal
saturation with the themes of individual rights, slavery, and
liberation. Regardless, they‚Äôre certainly present, and most of them
disturbingly for comedic effect.

As a silent character to the audience, it‚Äôs understandable that
Chewbacca had too many limitations to occupy a strong second to Han
Solo‚Äôs lead in the narrative‚Äôs eye, and perhaps the relationship between
the two as portrayed in the previous films reeked so strongly of
servitude that it was an inevitable element when the time came to write
them their very own movie. In direct contrast to the firm place of all
droids in the social hierarchy of the last 9 movies‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääaddressing humans
as ‚ÄúMaster,‚Äù unapologetically spoken of as property, and traded and/or
gifted as such by both protagonists and antagonists, etc.‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääwhat we see
of Lando and L3 together is a genuinely and complexly affectionate
partnership between equals, which _Solo_ makes an effort to emphasize,
if only to laugh at.

In response to the forced violence between two drones for spectator
sport, L3 is completely enraged, and she cries (among other things) ‚Äúwe
are sentient!,‚Äù but her distress is trivialized as hysterical
distraction (see: _Django Unchained_.) When she suggests to Qi-ra that
Lando (who is already illegitimized as a cheating narcissist, and
therefore effeminate) is attracted to her, it‚Äôs a joke (which many in my
audience laughed at) at the expense of her trivialized sexuality. After
she triumphs and declares the liberation of her kind to be her true
cause, she is immediately destroyed fighting for its sake, yet her
ideology is not once acknowledged by her fleshy companions, and her body
is quickly gutted for the data on her ‚Äúcentral processing unit‚Äù as it‚Äôs
interfaced with the _Falcon_. Granted, Lando _does_ thoughtfully muse
‚Äúshe‚Äôs part of the ship now‚Äù shortly afterward, which would be nice, if
you‚Äôd forgotten his last words were an outright lie. Lastly, it‚Äôs worth
noting how apathetic the main characters themselves are toward the
Kessel miners, especially as they are packing up to leave, when the
camera pans over the chaotic struggle between the liberated and their
guards in very close proximity to the awaiting _Falcon_, yet there was
not a suggestion that they would even _consider_ letting them take
refuge from the violence in their very spacious freighter. Aside from
Han‚Äôs or Qi-ra‚Äôs, *Solo treats liberation as charming or amusing,
nothing more*.

Anyway, the crown jewel of _Solo_ for many fans will probably be the
scene of the infamous Kessel Run, when Han Solo and Chewbacca first take
the helm(?) of the _Millennium Falcon_ with Lando injured and L3
dissected, using her ‚Äúnavigational database‚Äù to plot a very risky
shortcut around the scary space cloud by the scary space squid and the
scary space hole in order to make it to the site of the refinery before
the volatile Uranium explodes. Once there, _darn old flakey Lando_ fucks
the hell of in the _Falcon_ right as the Cloud Riders roll up, but
_whoa!_ their leader is actually a very young woman with freckles! She
describes the atrocities of Crimson Dawn and suggests that Han (who‚Äôs
now the established decisionmaker for whatever reason) give _them_ the
Uranium in order to establish ‚Äúthe beginning of a rebellion,‚Äù which we
can safely assume is _The_ Rebellion, which does beg one to wonder why
Solo never once bragged among the later rebellion about having started
the whole thing in the other films, considering that‚Ää‚Äî‚Ää_whaddya
know_‚Ää‚Äî‚Äähe says yes!

Woody, however, says he‚Äôs going to retire upon the news of this decision
before immediately reappearing again on Scarred Jarvis‚Äô yacht after he‚Äôs
revealed to have betrayed the Uranium ruse to him. Qi-ra ends up killing
Scarred Jarvis, saving Han, but after promising to follow him and
escape, she rings up the late Scarred Jarvis‚Äô boss‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääa Sith Zabrak who,
I would argue, is _not necessarily_ Darth Maul, though he probably
is‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääand informs him that her boss is dead and she‚Äôs assumed his post.
As Han and Woody meet again in an Old West standoff (complete with
sand,) the latter insists _one more time_ that Qi-ra is not who Han
thinks she is (as Jarvis and Qi-ra herself have also said repeatedly,)
describing her as ‚Äúa survivor,‚Äù before Han kills him in self-defense.

Finally, after seeing the Cloud Riders off with the Uranium, Han finds
Lando once again in a card game‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääthis time taking care to disable his
sleight-of-hand device beforehand so that he wins the _Millennium
Falcon_, ‚Äúfair and square,‚Äù and we cut to Solo (who seems remarkably
upbeat considering the recent betrayal of the lover he‚Äôd longed years to
reunite with) and Chewie in her cockpit as they tie in that one last
knot by declaring their destination, Tatooine, before roaring off into
hyperspace, leaving the credit roll in their wake.

Over two years ago, I concluded http://bit.ly/wigglecruise[my first work
for _Extratone_] about _The Force Awakens_ by arguing that _Star Wars_
on the big screen should be allowed to die in favor of investing the
time, energy, and funding they require in the pursuit of something new,
but the industry still appears to believe that nostalgia is a surer bet
where profits are concerned, at least, even after two whole decades of
mind-numbing reanimated properties. I didn‚Äôt catch _The Last Jedi_ until
recently, which was remarkably well-done measured against the others as
a _Star Wars_ movie, but certainly didn‚Äôt aim to achieve much more.
Clearly, there must be some truth in Hollywood‚Äôs cowardice about
original properties- especially when it comes to the sort of fantasy
armed with potent but unguided emotional bombs that define the _Star
Wars_ universe, so it wouldn‚Äôt make much sense to revive my old
diatribe, here. (Though I can assure you that I will be relentless if
this horseshit continues for much longer.) _The Force Awakens_ and _The
Last Jedi_, though, were episodic titles for the family, and these
spinoffs that began with _Rogue One_ are supposed to be for‚Ä¶ well, I‚Äôm
not entirely sure. In reality, they‚Äôve only moved the proverbial bar up
a very wee bit to the family who occasionally says ‚Äúshit,‚Äù because
they‚Äôre not intellectually stimulating enough to justify themselves as
Big Boy-only productions. Or, they wouldn‚Äôt be, were they not part of
this franchise.

The truth is, the fans have grown up, and they‚Ä¶ _I_‚Ä¶ will still buy a
ticket for the smallest crumb of hope that a product of this huge
machine will be capable of making us feel even a fraction of what we
felt as children watching the original films. For me, _The Force
Awakens_ actually did, once, in that blast of horns before the opening
crawl, but it hasn‚Äôt happened since, and I should certainly stop
expecting or wanting to expect that it will. For others, it‚Äôs still
working. Though there was a fraction of who I expected to be in
attendance with me, they did laugh at a handful of (mostly fascist)
moments, and whooped, hollered, and even clapped for a few seconds at
the end. I‚Äôm surprised opening night wasn‚Äôt packed because Portland is
the single most nostalgia-addicted culture I‚Äôve ever seen anywhere in
the United States. Then again, there _are_ a billion theaters here, so
perhaps the sample is just lousy. We‚Äôll see how tomorrow and Sunday go,
but I‚Äôd be surprised if any boxoffice records were broken.

In the past, when film enthusiasts andfans have described Han Solo as
‚Äúthe best character in _Star Wars_,‚Äù they‚Äôve actually been praising his
_potential_ as a character, not his material itself, and _Solo_‚Äôs most
effective function as a franchise film was to shut that praise down. Han
was not at all denied his movie‚Ää‚Äî‚Ää_this_ is _his_ movie‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääand it
provided him the screentime to show us who he truly is and why we
_really_ like him so much: *he doesn‚Äôt fucking change*. The secret to
Han Solo‚Äôs moral and emotional resiliency is nothing more than halted
development. The same old inner conflict between the tough, ruthlessly
self-interested persona he does his best to project for everyone around
him and the consistent reality of his soft insides was presented in his
first scene way back in 1977, and we‚Äôre now sure that he was unable to
make _any_ progress toward its resolution despite openly and obviously
brooding over it for an entire lifetime: from at least as early as his
young adulthood in this film until his death at the hands of his little
Sith son. _There is 0 variation_. He _always_ comes back for the cause
at the crucial moment after declaring himself through with it. Without
fail, he‚Äôll sacrifice the entirety of any self-making enterprise for
just about any underdog with a problem who crosses his path. (Which
probably explains his constantly-fleeting success as a smuggler well
into gray hair and jowls.) _Solo_ is abundantly clear about Han‚Äôs true
nature and very willing to expose how uninteresting it is. When he first
proclaims to Qi-ra that he‚Äôs become ‚Äúan outlaw,‚Äù she shuts him down with
the film‚Äôs ultimate quote, insisting that she ‚Äúknows who [he] _really_
is: _the good guy._‚Äù

If the video game-despising fans will bear with me for a moment, it‚Äôs
worth noting that Bioware‚Äôs _Star Wars: The Old Republic_ MMORPG is the
most interesting and extensive source of nuanced narrative in the IP (it
holds the world record for the largest voiceover project ever produced,)
and most of it can now be experienced without actually playing the game.
Like _Solo_, it‚Äôs set pre-saga, but considerably before‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääa few
centuries, if I remember correctly, which gave the writers a gigantic
opportunity to both expand and predestine the universe. There are eight
different class stories with around 50 cumulative hours of dialog, each.
A few are relatively unimaginative, but the majority are complex,
exciting, emotionally-involved tales that create very rich characters,
and all of them can be streamed in their entirety on YouTube. If you are
willing to see the potential of a Han Solo-like character fulfilled in a
different medium, the http://bit.ly/torsmuggler[Smuggler class story] is
a pretty damned engaging exploration of the _kind outlaw with conflicted
identity issues_ angle.

From my perspective, _Solo_‚Äôs frequent less-than-subtle maltreatment of
some very brutal and sensitive power relationships makes it the most
toxic of the _Star Wars_ films yet, and I assume it ended up that way,
unnecessarily because Ron Howard is an all-American son of a bitch. If
these titles are going to continue to be passed around between bigwhig
directors, future unpleasantries are inevitable. Notably, I‚Äôve yet to
see any mention of these disturbing themes from the respectable
authorities of the film criticism establishment, who‚Äôve been
overwhelmingly
https://www.newyorker.com/culture/richard-brody/wookiee-nights-solo-a-star-wars-story-reviewed[charmed]
by _Solo_‚Äôs nostalgia. Take from that whatever you will.

If we continue to love the character Han Solo, it‚Äôll be in the same way
we love our earnest, foolish, emotionally-stunted manchild fathers who‚Äôs
developmental inadequacies are often embarrassing, sometimes abusive,
and thoroughly pitiful. _Solo_ leaves no more room for an idealized,
elegant perception of this character‚Ää‚Äî‚Äähe‚Äôs no more than a _pretty good
guy_ with a lifelong addiction to thrill-seeking and a shitload of luck.

To declare unequivocally whether or not _Solo: A Star Wars Story_ is
worth a trip the cinema with your date, your children, or just your own
damned conscience would require me to disregard a whole host of
complicating factors, but if you‚Äôve stuck it this far with me, you‚Äôd
have a lot to disregard yourself to jump in. I‚Äôd advise that parents
watch it themselves before deciding whether or not it‚Äôs something worth
adding to your child‚Äôs life. Of those of you like me who‚Äôll tow the line
despite what you know and watch a _Star Wars_ film alone on opening
night in delirium hoping for just a drop from the Fountain of Youth, I
would ask: how long are we really going to keep kidding ourselves?

[[section0045.xhtml#a-decade-of-iphone-has-probably-ruined-my-life-but-will-the-8-plus-finally-end-it]]
== A decade of iPhone has probably ruined my life, but will the 8 Plus finally end it?

_Listen to this review read by Siri Voice 2 below..._

_Is my True Tone bullshit on?_

‚ÄúTrue Tone‚Äù is so forgettable, everybody had to mention it first. Quite
simply, it uses an ambient light sensor to fiddle with white balance,
warming the colors of the display as an immediately-obvious whole, yes,
but an interesting contrast to show off is no longer inherently
justified in being called a ‚Äúfeature‚Äù in Apple products, anymore.
Essentially, no matter who you ask (aside from
https://youtu.be/AXU8GqaMsQc?t=7m23s[Jon Rettinger],) you _should not_
buy an iPhone 8, though I did last Fall, not only because I had to
suddenly decide on a handset in less than 24 hours, but‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääif
anything‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääto say goodbye to the form, the operating system, and the
tech company which I have depended upon and carried with me virtually
every day for my entire adult life. I‚Äôd originally decided to abandon
this review due to a variety of unexpected circumstances, but Apple and
its iPhone have maintained their place in the news with their
https://www.apple.com/iphone-battery-and-performance/[battery scandal],
and a third of a year with the 8 Plus has included some experiences
which warrant a send-off before iOS 12 is released, making it (and
myself) totally irrelevant forever.

As the longstanding benchmark of the smartphone industry‚Äôs state at any
given time, the iPhone can be easy to reflect upon as a product once
occupying a state of universal exemption from criticism, but it has, in
fact,
http://theweek.com/articles/459748/7-reviews-original-iphone-from-2007[never
been so]. As Nilay Patel
https://www.theverge.com/2017/9/19/16323570/apple-new-iphone-8-review-plus-2017[noted],
one might regard the 8 as the last compromise of ‚Äúbasically four years‚Äù
of the same design. Since launch, it‚Äôs unsurprisingly stayed a wee bit
too far behind on the spreadsheets for most Android-type folks‚Ää‚Äî‚Äänot
that I‚Äôve ever believed them truthfully incapable of comprehending what
it means to _package_ a product, given where their greasy startups all
eventually ended up. (*You cannot doubt me*‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäI once took a year-long
sabbatical from iOS with a https://youtu.be/nSWgS0l0kc8[Sony Xperia
Play], and my authority is absolute.) The rest are trying to decide
whether or not to pay $200 more for
‚Äúhttps://www.wsj.com/articles/iphone-8-apples-middle-child-1505322945[the
phone of the future],‚Äù which knows when you‚Äôre watching it, and is only
good for playing half an hour of stupid video games before it needs a
charge.

So far, I have maintained that my first generation iPhone was the best
handset of all time‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääone hell of an Email Machine that lasted me close
to five years‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääthroughout the last two with actual motherboard exposed
to the elements in the corner of its cracked screen. That said, who
knows how it‚Äôd feel to be coerced into using ‚ÄúiPhone OS 2‚Äù as it was
called, then, for an entire workday in 2018? Two years prior to bringing
home an 8 Plus, I http://bit.ly/drycast47[vowed] that my 6S Plus would
be my last ever Apple device, but this one _actually_ feels like a last
hurrah. Though the ability to _Tweet directly from the swipe-down
notification menu_ is still nowhere to be found (it‚Äôs been gone for 5
releases, now, and would seem to have been forgotten by _literally_
everyone but myself,) one gets the sense that Apple‚Äôs efforts to add to
the iPhone 8 and iOS 11 were to make amends with us by settling a few
debts.

In part, they did. Native apps got a major overhaul‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääincluding Mail,
which was startling, considering that I‚Äôd been looking at what was near
as makes no difference the same UI my eldest phone shipped with. As a
result, it alone constitutes my benchmark for an email service, and I
have been left without a clue as to what _a good one_ looks like.
(Apparently it was
https://www.pcmag.com/article/342889/the-best-mobile-email-client-apps[really
bad]?) Since time began, there has always been at least one alternative
email app of the moment that tech journos refer to as the must-have,
end-all replacement.
https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/email-edison-mail/id922793622?mt=8[Edison
Mail] is currently the smoother, faster, most modular option‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääat least
for another few minutes‚Äì but I‚Äôll never know it as I know Mail, and I‚Äôll
never want to. Playing around with experimental email apps is too scary.
What if I decide once again to kill that massive number in the red badge
and need to immediately mark 40,000 emails as read? It took all of my
iPhone 4‚Äôs 1.0Ghz CPU and proprietary software over 18 hours‚Ää‚Äî‚Äähow am I
supposed to trust a shabby little 6-month-old startup with such an
important task? Anybody with a hundred bucks can make an app, you know.

[[section0045.xhtml#why-is-the-app-store-now-the-best-looking-publishing-software-on-ios]]
=== Why is the App Store now the best-looking publishing software on iOS?

One might interpret the App Store‚Äôs redesign as an attempt by Apple to
control this conversation‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääof both the trending _new thing_ and the
old‚Äúessentials‚Äù that you‚Äôve probably had tucked away in an untouched
folder for years. Technically, whoever the hell is writing those
gorgeously-presented daily bits has made them a publishing company,
though I‚Äôm not so sure I‚Äôm not the last remaining user who‚Äôs continued
semi-regularly visiting their ‚ÄúToday‚Äù section. If I _did_ want to
actually read about apps (I don‚Äôt‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääwho does?) it wouldn‚Äôt make much
sense to seek critical reviews from the faceless boffins behind the
platform itself, regardless of how much better it may look than all of
the tech news sites, paywall or no.

Native screen recording could conceivably come in handy once or twice,
but I see no reason why the red bar must remain at the top of the
render, but it has, which could explain the total lack of any such video
in the wild. Front-facing 4K, 60fps capture is impressive, but
useless‚Ää‚Äî‚Äävloggers all have GoPros or DSLRs, these days, and sharing
through Snapchat and Instagram will always be ultra-compressed. (Here
are two sloppy test clips‚Ää‚Äî‚Äähttps://youtu.be/VnfkWkotGFw[at the zoo],
and https://youtu.be/KOs5m6ynKAI[fishing].)

Perhaps some have figured out the new Files ‚Äúapp,‚Äù but it‚Äôs sat on my
homescreen for months, untapped, and it will likely remain there for all
time as a sort of soothing trophy‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääa thanks for my legacy iPhone
loyalty. My reward for half a lifetime of syncing, scrolling, and
tolling? *I can now view some of the files on my Mobile Computing
Device*, and even _scan documents in_, which is mostly novel (though it
is fun to digitize excerpts from physical text.) At some point, I
must‚Äôve mischecked a permanent option because all file types now open
only in an app that does not recognize them. God bless.

Somehow, I‚Äôve managed to fill my social circle with precisely zero
iOS-using folks. All of my friends and colleagues use Android devices
(including https://soundcloud.com/extratonemagazine/nextbit[Tim‚Äôs
supercool Nextbit Robin],) which provide a few handy datapoints (like
the camera in https://flic.kr/p/BXruaL[my fiance‚Äôs Galaxy S8],) but
deprive me of any significant experience with the ostensibly
intoxicating cult of iMessage. I‚Äôm constantly listening to and reading
tech writers claim that it‚Äôs
https://www.theverge.com/2016/10/10/13225514/apple-iphone-cant-switch-pixel-android-imessage-addiction[one
of the only reasons they‚Äôre still using iPhones], but my own food-OS
loving biome has forced me to find others, and frankly, I can‚Äôt imagine
looking at the
http://www.extratone.com/audio/futureland/toomanymessengers/[_gluttonous_]
palate of available mobile, cross-platform messaging services (Telegram,
https://telegram.org/blog/telegram-x[now Telegram X], WhatsApp, Signal,
Snapchat, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Discord, Slack, _Tinder?_,
Google Hangouts, Google Allo, Google Chat, Viber, Skype, Line, Wire,
etc.) and thinking‚Ä¶ _well, none of this will do_!

Honestly‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääeven if I‚Äôd actually been at all informed in my haste, the
photographic capabilities of the 8 Plus, alone would‚Äôve sold it. It‚Äôs
not the new filters, gif functionality, or even ‚Äú3D Photos‚Äù‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääit‚Äôs those
mythical dual 12MP sensors (which it shares with something called the
iPhone X.) They‚Äôre no less than infallible. After four months of
http://bit.ly/ip8plus[astonishing captures]in all manner of conditions,
I don‚Äôt even care how exactly they do it anymore‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääit‚Äôs better to be
left marveling. This first example was taken at Keystone, Colorado in
the middle of a dark, cloudy Fall night‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääthe amount of light they were
able to find‚Ää‚Äî‚Ää‚Äúup to 80% more,‚Äù
https://www.apple.com/apple-events/september-2017/[according to

Here is an unquestionably sensible progression from which iPhone has
never wavered far since its fourth generation
http://www.extratone.com/words/inred/iphone4/[set the standard], but
it‚Äôs one of an unfortunate few. Siri is still useless and silly apart
from its ‚Äúdisable all alarms‚Äù feature and its ability to sound itself
off in response when you‚Äôre hysterically screaming and digging for it
through the vast plush of a forty-year-old Lincoln. The customizable
Control Center makes toggling low power mode, orientation lock, Wi-Fi,
and Bluetooth less frustrating (note the last two
https://www.wired.com/story/how-to-turn-off-wifi-and-bluetooth-in-ios11/[aren‚Äôt
quite hard switches],) though it should‚Äôve come years ago. Notifications
are slightly more sensible -certainly better than they were on Android
Gingerbread, but I‚Äôve heard things‚Äôve changed quite a bit since then.

I _have_ been tripped up by the lack of a 3.5mm audio jack a few times,
but it just http://www.extratone.com/words/inred/mono/[wouldn‚Äôt make
sense] from a hardware perspective, and the new external stereo
capability should refute those who can‚Äôt or won‚Äôt understand. Yes, it
would be nice if Apple hadn‚Äôt led the industry to quite such a
compromising obsession with thinness‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääwe‚Äôd all trade __a lot__of
substance for exponentially greater battery life, storage capacity,
water resistance, etc.‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääbut I don‚Äôt see much sense in expending your
energy holding up signs in Silicon Valley.

I‚Äôll be here long after you‚Äôve died, and you know why? Because I took
the time to sync my apps.

Two years ago, a new generation of social apps and the preposterous
notion of a quad-core CPU in my iPhone 6S Plus seemed like the harbinger
of a world I no longer understood. Now, most of those services have
expanded to the far boundaries of my reach, and I‚Äôve stopped counting
chips. Refinement of the hardware design is reverent to the extreme.
It‚Äôs pretentious, but Apple‚Äôs decision to pause on the 8 to consider
details like stuffing the legal text in the software and adding a little
bit of weight _back in_ for ergonomics‚Äô sake leads one to regard it as a
monument to all the devices along the development timeline that have led
to this‚Ä¶ last triumph. Or, it would have perhaps, had they not
https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2018/02/apple-reports-first-quarter-results/[sold
so many].

One could argue that good execution of consumer electronic design means
minimizing as much as possible the obstructions in the way of the user
completing any given task, and the iPhone 8 Plus has surpassed the vast
majority of these for myself‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääand I am, surely, a ‚Äúpower user.‚Äù iOS has
changed a lot in the decade I‚Äôve employed it‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääin far too many ways for
the worse‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääbut this pair of handset and software have reached _my_
imagination‚Äôs limit for what I could possibly want to do. Augmented
reality and wireless charging won‚Äôt ever have a place in my future, for
better or worse. Face ID is much too peculiar. Surely, this iPhone is
the ultimate expression of the first and fourth generation‚Äôs foundation.

If the 6S Plus was indeed the key to my immortality, I‚Äôm afraid the 8
Plus heralds my imminent demise. Whether or not it‚Äôs an early one is for
you to decide. This _really is_ my last iPhone.

[[section0046.xhtml#the-social-network-s-incongruities-better-its-experience-if-you-know-how]]
== The social network‚Äôs incongruities better its experience, if you know how.

On a recent Tuesday, I opened a just-begun
https://www.facebook.com/NASA/videos/10156260187261772/[livestream] on
Facebook from NASA‚Äôs official page with a panel of experts discussing
Europa‚Äôs plumes (or something like that) and ended up sticking around
for most of its hour-long duration because of the ridiculous realtime
comments from some of its ~4000 viewers. While some participants were
genuinely interested in the opportunity to engage the host‚Äôs authority
with relevant and invested questions (which were intermittently
fielded,) the vocal majority were aggressive, ignorant, and provocative
shouts. From my observation, the most noticeably manic and persistent of
these came from user https://www.facebook.com/shane.langman[Shane
Langman]. ‚ÄúNasa can telephone the moon in 1969 but can't get a phone
signal in death Valley in 2018,‚Äù he noted 16 minutes in. ‚ÄúWe cant leave
the earth or we'd have left it by now.‚Äù And there was Bobby Smith, who
felt compelled to express his authority on NASA‚Äôs inauthenticity:
‚Äú[I‚Äôve] been researching since 2012 no real pics of anything all cgi.‚Äù

Assuming the additional all-caps, sans-avatar ranting I remember reading
live was deleted after the fact by the culprits and/or the page‚Äôs
administrator, it‚Äôs worth noting that the remaining archive is full of
sincerely positive feedback: ‚ÄúIt would be awesome to discover life in
europe!!‚Äù Indeed.

After a few minutes of gawking at the mess, I noticed that the broadcast
was being simultaneously https://www.pscp.tv/NASA/1lDxLapRyjLKm[streamed
on Periscope] (or is it Twitter Video? or Twitter Live?) so I opened
both feeds side-by-side to compare their audience‚Äôs behavior. The
Periscope‚Äôs viewers averaged about 1000 strong, and their comments were
noticeably more orderly and decipherable. There was still trolling and
self-promotion, but it wasn‚Äôt allowed to disrupt the rest of the
committed discourse, perhaps because of each post‚Äôs character limit or
rationed screen time. Looking between them, the contrast in the user
culture and the function of the two services during the same,
simultaneous stream was at discouraging odds with their respective
popularity.

Neither are really very good ways to watch live video ‚Äì Periscope,
notably, was never designed for professional studio broadcasts ‚Äì but the
relentless malicious nonsense from the Facebook viewers pushed all
attempts at real engagement away so quickly that I could see no point in
making them at all. To be blunt: every conceivable corner of Facebook is
an unusable cesspool (even in the shadow of NASA earnestness,) and its
worth considering that something about the design of Twitter properties
generally discourages such overwhelmingly stupid noise. That‚Äôs not to
say that harassment, hate speech, misogyny, and radical racism have not
been religiously neglected or mishandled as has been well-reported
throughout the network‚Äôs history ‚Äì perhaps even more than any other ‚Äì
but I (a cis white man, mind you,) have seen _much_ more of these on
Facebook in the wild than I have on Twitter during my longtime use of
the two, despite spending exponentially more attention on the latter.

In my sparse Facebook browsing, I have witnessed childhood friends,
professional acquaintances, and family members both distant and
immediate publicly shame, harass, belittle, and spitefully argue with
each other for the sake of absolutely zero meaningful resolution,
conclusion, or intellectual progression. In my decade of daily Twitter
use, I have seen tens of pedophiles and rapists publicly outed, suicides
averted, government censorship circumvented, stories broken, artists
made, and marginalized voices outspoken. I have also Tweeted things in
the past (mostly variations of ‚ÄúI want to die‚Äù) that would now get my
account temporarily suspended, as per the company‚Äôs
https://mashable.com/2017/10/17/twitter-hate-speech-abuse-new-rules-women-boycott/[latest
attempts] to minimize its platform‚Äôs toxicity ‚Äì an encouraging
suggestion that Twitter is finally catching up and learning to avoid its
_cultural_ blunders, which have been the single greatest exception to
its most valuable core identity: its mistakes.

Two weeks ago, Twitter
https://blog.twitter.com/official/en_us/topics/product/2018/a-new-twitter-experience-on-windows.html[proudly
released] the first redesign of its native Windows 10 app since its
debut in 2015 ‚Äì leading a new generation of upcoming ‚Äúlightweight‚Äù
Progressive Web Apps and ‚Äì true to form ‚Äì immediately reclaimed the
title of clumsiest, least-useful Twitter client available. PWAs

surely be the best case to make.
https://developers.google.com/web/progressive-web-apps/[According to
Google] ‚Äì supreme enemy of the open web and all tasteful design ‚Äì PWAs
are _offline-first_, _instant-loading_, and _immersive_ ‚Äì none of which
are reasonable priorities in building a Twitter client for Windows, an
operating system running primarily on very powerful hardware. This sort
of idiocy can be reasonably expected of Twitter, but bewilderingly, the
Great Minds of tech journalism seem to be unanimously pleased by this
decision, which invites one to suspect that they‚Äôve all switched
secretly to the exclusive, illustrious
https://www.theguardian.com/technology/askjack/2017/may/18/windows-smartphone-still-worth-buying[HP
Elite X3] ‚Äì the only smartphone on sale running Windows 10, because
Twitter‚Äôs execution of these misaligned goals is mindbogglingly foul to
look at and unnecessarily frustrating to use. After doing my best to put
up with it for a few days, I found myself unable to conceieve of a
single advantage this new application has over literally any
alternative.

3 out of the 5 bulleted ‚Äúhighly-requested features‚Äù listed in their
https://blog.twitter.com/official/en_us/topics/product/2018/a-new-twitter-experience-on-windows.html[announcement]

years: the 280-character limit, Explore tab, and Bookmarks. ‚ÄúAdding‚Äù
these web-established operations to an even-more-web-based application
surely didn‚Äôt present much of a workload, but perhaps _removing_
functionality justified the investment. The F and T keys no longer
operate as shortcuts for liking and retweeting, which is such a
misguided oversight that I can‚Äôt help but wonder if this app was
actually intended to be utilized by anyone at all (besides HP Elite
users.)

_Am I missing something? Can you hear me? Are there any flesh-and-blood
Twitters users left?_

image:xhtml/https:/i.snap.as/FQvW9MC.png[Twitter Poll]

Then again, the ungainliness of Twitter‚Äôs new offspring could be
attributed to the perpetual tragedy of its mother‚Äôs peril. The company‚Äôs
luck has been on the down-and-out for eons in tech time: from its most
recent
https://www.wired.com/story/change-your-twitter-password-right-now/[plain
text password blunder], to its constant inability to

public] and
https://www.theverge.com/2016/10/14/13287818/no-one-wants-to-buy-twitter[potential

identity as a social network remains dramatically tense well past its
tenth year, which is good news for its continued survival. One could
certainly
https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/jan/05/can-donald-trump-save-twitter[argue]
that the Tump presidency alone spared Twitter from a painful decline
into irrelevance (or at least postponed it,) but I think we should
acknowledge by now that turmoil is an integral component of the brand as
an outlier in the connected community palette.

For myself as a long-dependent occupant, its inconsistencies and
contradictions are endearing and necessary ‚Äì a competent, profitable,
and sensical Twitter may as well be Facebook. If you‚Äôve been Tweeting as
long as I have, you‚Äôll likely remember that the company‚Äôs own offerings
had occupied the bottom-most position in the hierarchy of preferable
available clients throughout time and across all manner of operating
systems until it finally nailed its Android and iOS software and usurped
longtime third-party staples like
https://techcrunch.com/2015/10/01/tweetbot-4-0-becomes-the-best-alternative-twitter-client-for-iphone-and-now-ipad/[Tweetbot]
and
https://9to5mac.com/2015/01/26/twitterrific-5-ios-update-multi-image-support-videos-gifs/[Twitterific]
just a few years ago. Gadget blogging and
https://youtu.be/DP5Y-58mHic[_What‚Äôs in my Dock?_] videos may very well
be long-dead relics of a different era in tech media, but it‚Äôs
disheartening to find through research that the steadily-declining
quality of our user experience has been allowed to continue without much
protest. Justifiably or not, Twitter has persisted in adding stuff
nobody likes as they‚Äôve gradually neutered all the great third-party
development.

TweetDeck for Windows was perhaps the most powerful mainstream enduser
social application that will ever exist. Before
https://techcrunch.com/2011/05/23/twitter-buys-tweetdeck-for-40-million/[Twitter
absorbed the tool] in 2011, its https://youtu.be/HQhnbrwBfSw[diverse
account integration] allowed a user to send a single post across
Facebook, LinkedIn, MySpace, Google+, and multiple Twitter accounts
simultaneously, and they could configure the client to do so with just
the Enter key! In retrospect, it was naive to assume that such potent
spam capabilities would continue to be entrusted to the general
population without challenge, but the modularity and customizability of
TweetDeck prime as a standalone application made it useful as hell and
quite the power trip. Now, it exists only as a tamed,
up-to-brand-guidelines https://tweetdeck.twitter.com[web application],
yet remains the definitive way to use Twitter on a PC if one desires an
ad-free, single-window experience if only because of its congruence with
another, even more forgotten feature of the service: _lists._

image:xhtml/https:/i.snap.as/lGp1lWB.png[TweetDeck]

This is how I‚Äôve seen desktop Twitter since I lasted looked at my
timeline in 2010. Since then, I‚Äôve followed about 5000 more accounts, so
I‚Äôd imagine it‚Äôs a damned mess. I have a private list of my friends,
which I try to read in its entirety, and
https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/lists/the-new[a list of nearly 500
journalists, publications, and musicians] whom I‚Äôve found particularly
fresh and original. Thanks to these, Tweets are presented in order,
uninterrupted by ads. (They function the same on iOS.) The network‚Äôs
linear chronology is an absolute use condition for me, so I‚Äôm thankful I
completely missed the
https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/vv7g9d/twitter-is-testing-timelines-that-arent-in-chronological-order[beginning
of their progression toward algorithmic relevance] thanks to my lists,
and as I‚Äôve since happened upon distress from mutuals and non-mutuals
over
https://twitter.com/daniellemattoon/status/990079819202351104[missed or
stale Tweets], I have taken the time to relay my gospel: _lists are
linear_. And since promoted and sponsored Tweets began overwhelming and
perturbing timelines, I‚Äôve seen
https://twitter.com/kikkujo/status/996613451349815296[the displeasure]
and repeated: _lists are linear and ad-free_!

I realize how irritating it is when one plays the _why doesn‚Äôt anyone
listen to me?!_ card, so I‚Äôve created a
https://twitter.com/i/moments/996616971880882176[Twitter Moment] to
document the confusing silence I‚Äôve gotten in response to these
suggestions (though I couldn‚Äôt find any cases from the past, so I may be
misremembering the extent of my charity,) and pledging to refrain from
revisiting this pet advice of mine when writing about Twitter or other
social networks in the future.

== The recent history of the software and services we use to retain text, and how their development affects our behavior on the page.

I have only once in my many using years been gripped by the fear of the
Lord because of a software-related event. I was cruising my pitifully
ugly Google News feed on an October afternoon in 2015 looking for the
last little bit of material for the evening‚Äôs episode of _Drycast_, when
I happened to spy the words
‚Äúhttp://www.businessinsider.com/evernote-is-in-deep-trouble-2015-10[Evernote
is in Serious Trouble].‚Äù I doubt I screamed or anything, but I
definitely remember experiencing a very real, full-body shot of
adrenaline because _my entire creative life_ was contained at the time
within the nearly 40,000 notes I‚Äôd amassed on my Evernote account since
the service‚Äôs
https://web.archive.org/web/20120904074223/http://blog.evernote.com/2008/06/24/evernote-public-launch/[open
beta] in 2008. In fact, I was in that very moment using it for the live
show notes and so began to wonder how I could possibly continue if
Evernote were to be suddenly killed dead. For better or worse, though,
the ‚Äúunicorn‚Äù would indeed survive to see its tenth birthday this year,
though it‚Äôs arguably been eclipsed by the notetaking, journaling, and
word processing services its features predated and for which it was the
most significant forerunner not so long ago.

I‚Äôd been using the cloud-synced notetaking service for all of my
composition and research gathering since Junior High, when I thought
myself extremely clever with my cloud-syncing, iPhone-native notetaking
app when I‚Äôd watch other students struggling to find a flash drive or
log in to their email on school library computers. Since it worked with
any browser and my password was memorable (before the brute force
apocalypse and the need for password managers,) I could access my
documents, mp3s, and images _from anywhere,_ which was actually a pretty
big deal‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääespecially as more research and notetaking was required in
high school.

Yes, 10 years later, we are _swamped_ with infinite duplicates of
documents from our personal clouds, which are now inescapable and
plenty‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääthey follow us around from our pockets, purses, and backpacks
and rain notifications down upon us for single punctuation mark peer
edits, unnoticeable modification conflicts, or sometimes just for the
hell of it. There are now what seems like infinitely many available ways
to enter, edit, and publish text from wherever you happen to be, and
most of them are free, but very few are actually pleasantly executed
tools‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääall of which can all be said of most types of software now.
Since tech publications (and even tech _bloggers_ now,) aren‚Äôt doing
software reviews anymore because you won‚Äôt click on them, the task of
comparing between the lot so that you might be spared having to mess
around with _all_ of them to find out for yourself‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääthe function of
consumer journalism‚Ää‚Äî‚Äähas fallen to myself, alone because the _Fear of
The Unclicked_ is not known to me.

To assist me in bearing this terrible burden, you can allocate 1‚Äì3
minutes to http://bit.ly/howwewrite[*take the survey I created*] about
the text-entry tools you use to determine which tools people use at
different points in their writing process and across several uses. It
would be very much appreciated.

[[section0047.xhtml#feature-fucked]]
== Feature Fucked

Reading this via printed PDF, your hypothetical 100% offline
grandmother‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääthe successful children‚Äôs book author who needs word
processing but doesn‚Äôt require connectivity because she doesn‚Äôt do
research or correspond with anyone‚Ää‚Äî‚Äämight ask _well whatever was the
matter with Microsoft Word? Surely I don‚Äôt need more than that!_
Technically, she‚Äôd be correct in a major sense: Word has been able to
sync via Microsoft OneDrive between PC or Mac with iOS or Android for a
while now, but I wouldn‚Äôt vouch for the latter for any use other than
reading or very lightly editing a document because the relationship
between the mobile apps and their desktop counterparts is inevitably
strained. Because Microsoft Word is such old software, it‚Äôs filled with
some obscure functionalities I‚Äôm sure even its creators have forgotten.
Over years and years of development, these tools have been stacked on
top of one another so that actually mastering the labyrinth could be a
college major in and of itself.

image:xhtml/https:/i.snap.as/JUh9srV.png[Word Processing Survey Pie
Chart]

Basically, you can tell your grandmother that *Microsoft Word is a huge
old bitch*, but it‚Äôs still the industry standard for formatting and
publishing works at the end of the line. As you can see from our survey
results, *58.1% of you use ‚Äúlegacy‚Äù word processing software to finish
up your first drafts* (as of May 30th,) which makes you more modern than
even a slightly-older population, I‚Äôd wager.

While we‚Äôre on the subject of the old hag, it‚Äôs worth pointing out how
ridiculously behind the times its open source ‚Äúalternatives‚Äù are.
*OpenOffice*‚Äôs last major update was the
https://blogs.apache.org/OOo/entry/a_short_celebration_and_then[release
of version 4.0] in July of 2013, and it‚Äôs not correctly scaled for the
small, high-DPI displays sold at just about every price level, nowadays.
It was okay when I couldn‚Äôt afford to pay for a license in high school
(and saw no reason to,) but it now looks sort of awful, especially
considering that the version of Office (and therefore Word) to which I‚Äôm
comparing its screenshots is actually _also_ from 2013.

The other, ‚Äúfresher‚Äù open source option of the moment is called
*LibreOffice Writer*, and its suite has been attracting a fair amount of
praise‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäI think
‚Äúhttps://www.zdnet.com/article/libreoffice-the-best-office-suite-gets-even-better-with-libreoffice-6-0/[every
bit as good] [as Word]‚Äù is taking things a bit far, but its sixth
version looks significantly better than OpenOffice on _my_ machine, at
least, and generally operates more smoothly as well. That age-old banner
of _Open Source_ won‚Äôt matter for much longer, though, if all kinds of
software continue to be abandoned and substituted with Progressive Web
Apps for http://bit.ly/uselists[no damned reason]. Considering how much
time some of us have already spent in front of Word, it‚Äôs no wonder
we‚Äôre spoiled: even my 5-year-old edition of Microsoft Office syncs with
the app on my iPhone (with some pleading,) and looks _extremely_ crisp.
As far as paid featured desktop-class alternatives, there‚Äôs just one
more: *WordPerfect*, which I have never used or heard anyone else
mention.

[[section0047.xhtml#the-hybrids]]
== The Hybrids

When it was conceived, *Evernote* pioneered the recipe that now serves
as the foundation of the feature development in today‚Äôs notetaking and
journaling applications, as evidenced by CEO Phil Libin‚Äôs unapologetic
use of the term
‚Äúhttps://techcrunch.com/2009/12/30/evernote-two-million/[life-logging]‚Äù
in 2009, which sounds bizarre in retrospect because we‚Äôre now
well-accustomed to easily ‚Äúsnapping geotagged photos‚Äù (smartphones had
always included location data in their photo files‚Äô meta, but Evernote
was the first app to give a user access to the data _on their device_,)
‚Äúmaking voice notes,‚Äù or and organizing text notes via advanced
categorization and metadata-enabled searchability. These features are
essentials in the apps you could accurately describe as ‚Äúlife-loggers‚Äù
available for download now. Snapchat‚Äôs ‚ÄúMemories‚Äù especially come to
mind, and I‚Äôve long argued that we should
http://bit.ly/redevernote[blame (or praise) Evernote for beginning the
era of eternal memory].

The iPhone OS app‚Äôs design would even influence Apple‚Äôs own
https://www.theverge.com/2013/9/18/4741724/ios-7-review[additions to its
native photo and note applications in iOS7], much further down the line.
Its technical doctrine of on-device storage coupled with syncing via The
Cloud would inspire both
https://www.pcmag.com/commentary/345839/evernotes-loss-is-onenotes-gain[Microsoft‚Äôs
OneNote] and
https://www.theverge.com/2012/8/3/3212579/the-best-journal-app-day-one[Bloom‚Äôs
gorgeous DayOne]. There was even a ‚Äúfull-featured‚Äù
http://howardcodner.blogspot.com/2011/02/nevernote-is-full-featured-evernote-app.html[Linux-running
offshoot called NeverNote].

In contrast with Evernote‚Äôs relatively busy design, *DayOne* has been
the
https://thesweetsetup.com/apps/the-very-best-journaling-logging-app/[best-looking
app of any kind on iOS for years]. It shipped with the same sort of
extensive categorization, but it‚Äôs only ever been available on iOS,
Android, and OSX‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääprobably because Windows simply doesn‚Äôt look good
enough. Should you wish, it will add detailed metadata from the moment
you begin each journal entry including precise-ish GPS coordinates, an
overview of your location‚Äôs weather at the time, _whether or not you
were moving_, what song you were listening to, and your step count for
the day (now from the Health app.) You have the option of viewing your
journal chronologically, by location on a map, or in a social-esque
activity feed, and yes‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääits search function can be filtered by any of
these datapoints.

image:xhtml/https:/i.snap.as/83yczp2.png[Day One]

image:xhtml/https:/i.snap.as/ZKsNUvr.png[Day One]

In 2015,
https://thesweetsetup.com/day-one-updated-with-new-sync-option/[Bloom
added iCloud syncing] and multiple journals, further closing the
functionality gap between the two apps on paper, yet plenty of users
continue to tether between the two using IFTTT (including myself for all
my Twitter favorites, just to compare.) Within the somewhat forgotten
niche of the ‚Äúlife-logging‚Äù utility, DayOne is superior and serves well
the self-obsessed user who find the little details of their life to be
_extremely interesting._ Last Spring,
https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2017/4/25/15426678/day-one-book-print-journal[they
introduced] the option to purchase a stylized physical book of a user‚Äôs
journal from within the app. As it is currently priced, the 2,674-page
book I previewed today containing every single Tweet I‚Äôve favorited in
the past 5 years displayed in a delicately-formatted layout would set me
back over $365, and would have to be split into 5 separate books (as per
the maximum of 400 pages each.) Since I find my life _very_ interesting,
I‚Äôve made a note to myself to proceed if/when I ever have that sort of
money to throw around.

For the *67.7%* of you who use digital notetaking or word processing
software when you ‚Äú*want to remember something*,‚Äù DayOne is the best
option available because of its search function and satisfaction-of-use.
Though Evernote was once the only app that could
‚Äúhttps://www.theverge.com/2014/9/4/6103843/best-note-taking-app-iphone[handle
everything everything in your head],‚Äù it‚Äôs a different experience
entirely‚Ää‚Äî‚Äätailored for work applications, if anything, since DayOne‚Äôs
growth spurt. The company, itself hasn‚Äôt exactly been managed cleanly,
either with
https://www.theverge.com/2015/9/29/9420031/evernote-layoffs-office-closures[layouts
in 2015] and
https://www.theverge.com/2016/12/16/13979778/evernote-privacy-policy-opt-out[a
privacy scandal in 2016], but then again, what billion-dollar company
doesn‚Äôt have its controversies?

Despite having imported my huge catalog of Evernote entries into DayOne,
the former often gets stuck, and it‚Äôs retained the most irritating habit
of all the software mentioned in this column. Because synced entries in
Evernote are not live-updated like those in Google Docs or Dropbox
Paper, it‚Äôs possible to modify or add to a note on one device while it‚Äôs
open (and static) on another, which is addressed by either duplicating
the most recent entry and filing it in the default ‚ÄúConflicting Changes‚Äù
folder, or pasting the duplicate of the entire contents above the ‚Äúold‚Äù
content in the note, separated by a horizontal line. I‚Äôve yet to figure
out the behavior that triggers which fix, but I don‚Äôt particularly
care‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäI‚Äôve decided to restrict my Evernote use to my desktop,
absolutely. If I haven‚Äôt articulated it well enough for you to form a
visual, just trust me: *it‚Äôs very, very annoying*, and it should‚Äôve been
addressed years ago.

It was my stepfather who told me about Evernote and signed me up for
that beta. Both of us were then the sort of people who experienced
extreme satisfaction in archiving and categorizing stuff (which is
probably the most straightforward way to define _nerd_,) but he was
especially and absolutely enthralled with its
https://blog.evernote.com/blog/2008/06/26/web-clipping/[Web Clipper
function], which allowed the user to save webpages with ‚Äúcontext‚Äù‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääboth
the metadata (source URL, date) and contents in ‚Äúthe text, images, and
links‚Äù via their Firefox extension, which was revolutionary from our
perspective, and certainly beat the hell out of stuffed, ugly bookmark
folders or printed-to-pdfs. However, Web 2.0 was a younger, then and
http://www.websiteoptimization.com/speed/tweak/average-web-page/[significantly
more lithe]‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääthe average web page is now _10 times larger_ (disclosure:
https://www.igvita.com/2016/01/12/the-average-page-is-a-myth/[‚Äúaverage
web page‚Äù is a somewhat misleading term], though I think we can probably
agree that it‚Äôs _too fucking big_, regardless,) and it‚Äôs long past time
for us to accept that this technology is no longer a reasonable solution
to saved images.

image:xhtml/https:/i.snap.as/eKdKSyd.png[Evernote Web Clipper]

Though development on the Web Clipper appears to have continued‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääit‚Äôs
now on Version 7.something‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääthe vast majority of the pages you‚Äôd want
to save on the web
(https://twitter.com/FickleCrux/status/1001763470902099968[except for
Linkedin, apparently],) show Evernote‚Äôs age as it attempts to clip
them‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääoften taking _several minutes_ to yield the product, which is
_always_ broken as hell. Don‚Äôt take my word for it, though: another one
of Evernote‚Äôs less-discussed features _technically_ makes it a
publishing platform because I can share a note from my account with you,
the world, via
http://www.evernote.com/l/ACT8YDUZovlFS6iWaPOsGpW9uVFqlXkt2YQ/[this
public link]. It‚Äôs a clip I took a year ago of
https://www.wired.com/2014/02/myspace_jad/[_Wired_‚Äôs profile of Jad
Abumrad], and you‚Äôll notice that it isn‚Äôt _completely_ unreadable, but
it _is_ ugly and broken. Even after
https://techcrunch.com/2017/01/17/evernote-attempts-to-simplify-with-its-new-ios-app/[last
year‚Äôs update], it‚Äôs still clumsy, slow, and virtually unusable without
a stellar data connection.

*Archive obsessives*, I know that Evernote could have become part of
_your system_ and over time, you may have built a gargantuan library
within it‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääthe perfection of your tagging system‚Äôs efficiency and your
categorical format‚Äôs consistency making it such a treasure that you
might think of it in times of duress to calm yourself. I‚Äôve allowed
myself to continue using it _exclusively_ for notes in my novel project,
so I do understand that it may represent tens of thousands of hours of

As you‚Äôd expect, software has changed a lot
https://lifehacker.com/5590027/five-best-mobile-note-taking-tools[since
2010], and the choices available for word processing are now abundant
and relatively diverse. As for web clipping, in particular, I would
suggest your new browser Vivaldi and its super capable
https://vivaldi.com/blog/seize-the-moment-with-vivaldi-1-7/[full-page
capture feature], which I‚Äôve used for everything from snapping a
http://extratone.com/media/alltratodata.png[25.1 MB, 30,000 pixel-high
PNG capture of all Extranet data in text form] to the
http://bit.ly/extrfonts[photo specimens we submitted to Fonts in Use],
to https://twitter.com/FickleCrux/status/969833640598306817[crisp snips
of full words]. For comparison,
http://extratone.com/media/jadwired.png[here‚Äôs what it captured] of that
old _Wired_ post on Jad. You‚Äôll notice that while the image is
relatively large, none of the article itself has been lost (aside from
the featured image, on _Wired_‚Äôs end,) and the resolution is fine enough
that you could still crop out quotes or smaller shots to share if you
discovered something later. This ability of Vivaldi‚Äôs still feels like
magic to me, and there are plenty of other reasons to use the browser,
but I‚Äôll save that discussion for a later date.

I could cite plenty of pseudoidealistic reasons to _never_ use Google
Chrome, Google Docs, Google Keep, or any other Google product, really,
mostly because they all look like shit,
https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/4/16805216/google-chrome-only-sites-internet-explorer-6-web-standards[their
browser is swallowing the internet], (along with their
‚Äúhttps://www.theverge.com/2018/2/13/17006006/google-amp-stories-google-search-slideshows[accelerated
mobile pages]‚Äù project,) and just about everything the company was built
on‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääalong with
https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/17/17365362/google-chrome-secure-indicator-https[what
they plan for the future]‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääis completely (and sometimes even
https://gizmodo.com/google-removes-nearly-all-mentions-of-dont-be-evil-from-1826153393[explicitly])
opposed to The Open Web, good design, and
http://bit.ly/googlechurch[humanity as a whole]. However, I fully
realize that idealism doesn‚Äôt mean shit when you‚Äôre just trying to get
the job done, so let‚Äôs talk about Keep and Docs.

*Google Keep* is part notetaking service and part streamlined,
modernized, hassle-free execution of Evernote‚Äôs Web Clipper. If you‚Äôre
already using Chrome or you‚Äôre desperate enough for the ability to clip
web pages without switching windows for whatever reason that you‚Äôd
change your browsing habits entirely, you can add its extension to the
top task bar‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääright next to Evernote‚Äôs‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääand use it any time you feel
that old archivist itch. The extension will very quickly and smoothly
clip the title and URL, along with whatever of your own text/tags you
feel like using, but it will _not_ attempt to capture any of the web
page‚Äôs content (Google already has it somewhere, anyway.)

image:xhtml/https:/i.snap.as/Uw8kvMU.png[Optical Character Recognition]

Like all of its kin, Google Keep is particularly
https://www.computerworld.com/article/3026239/android/google-keep-3-years.html[savvy
with integration]: you can immediately send your clip to a Google Doc,
set a reminder, add a collaborator and even _draw_ on any entry. Its
party piece in this Tactile Era of touch-enabled laptops and
keyboard-equipped tablets is its ability to digitize handwriting or
‚Äúgrab image text,‚Äù a novelty technology called Optical Character
Recognition, which has been
http://history-computer.com/ModernComputer/Basis/OCR.html[tickling our
most stale fantasies for centuries], now. Though I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs genuinely
appreciated in a handful of especially quaint use cases, somewhere in
the world, there‚Äôs never going to be an at-scale application for this
sort of thing. I know my handwriting is bad, but if
http://bit.ly/keephand[Keep can‚Äôt ‚Äúgrab‚Äù it reliably], there‚Äôs not much
sense in using it at all for me, though Google‚Äôs Academy for Young
Algorithms will certainly make sure to save every one of my motions to
capitalize on _my_ time (or yours.)

*Microsoft OneNote* is as clunky, busy, and buggy as Google Keep is
quick and uninspiring, but that‚Äôs probably because it‚Äôs much _much_
older than I remember. To demonstrate its web clipping function, I
clipped the https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,1273091,00.asp[OneNote
portion] of
https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,1273084,00.asp[_PCMagazine_‚Äôs
Microsoft Office 2003 review] and exported it into a
http://extratone.com/library/onenote-pcmag.pdf[PDF], which isn‚Äôt a
straightforward process, but is it useful? No. Because it‚Äôs a PDF, it‚Äôs
almost unreadably low-resolution, yet manages to weigh 1.2 MB. My
(cropped) http://extratone.com/media/onenote2003.png[Vivaldi capture of
the same page] is 988 kB and nearly impossible to tell apart from the
live experience, so why are we bothering with OneNote at all? Well,
according to
https://www.computerworld.com/article/2488890/enterprise-applications/desktop-apps-onenote-vs-evernote-a-personal-take-on-two-great-note-taking-apps.html[Preston
Gralla for _ComputerWorld_] (the last tech site still publishing
worthwhile software reviews):

____
It bristles with note-creation tools for drawing, recording audio and
video, scanning images, embedding spreadsheets and reviewing the edits
of others (although the abilities of those tools differ somewhat
depending on the platform). In fact, its note-creation tools are more
comprehensive than Evernote‚Äôs.
____

And we begin to see OneNote‚Äôs place as the feature-heavyweight of synced
notetaking applications.

____
The organization-minded will appreciate OneNote‚Äôs basic structure. You
create individual notebooks; within each notebook, you can create
section groups that contain multiple sections. Each section has
individual pages, with each page a separate note. It‚Äôs ideal for
organizing content with a logical structure.
____

Then again, dearest Preston goes on to express his adoration for
Evernote Web Clipping shortly afterwards and he did so just last year,
so I won‚Äôt really claim to know what‚Äôs going on with him (he‚Äôs a legacy
tech journo.) In my experience with twenty-somethings and younger, the
more committed an artist or writer is to their craft, the less
interested they are in its tools, but it‚Äôs the young ones who need great
tools the most before they‚Äôre able to settle on and pin down their
process. There was only *a single writer* (*3.2%*) surveyed who answered
‚Äú*when I want to DIGITALLY record something to remember, I use‚Ä¶*‚Äù with
‚Äú*the ‚Äòcompose‚Äô function (to publish immediately and/or save for later
as a draft) of a web-based text sharing service (Twitter, Tumblr,
Medium, WordPress, Facebook, etc.)*,‚Äù and *one other* answered ‚Äú*another
text-entry field on my device where it will be saved for later*,‚Äù which
*four users* (*13.3%*) said they use to ‚ÄúBrainstorm‚Äù digitally.

By Question Set 3, the two alternative answers were dropped and for
‚ÄúOutlining‚Äù digitally, *45.2%* of surveyees use legacy word processors,
*35.5%* use *cloud-based notetaking apps*, and *19.4%* use *the default
notetaking program installed on their device*. In omitting alternative
options earlier and including web-native CMS editors later, I inevitably
shepherded answers within a moderately-wide berth of where my own
assumptions would lead their process. It‚Äôs interesting that for the last
prompt, ‚Äú*to make the last modifications to my final draft, I‚Ä¶*‚Äù a whole
*35.5%* reported they would still be using a *cloud-based service*
instead of a *legacy word processor* (*58.1%*) or *CMS editor* (*6.5%*),
which would suggest that the functionality of these new e-enabled
methods of composition has become truly important, indeed.

Though it‚Äôs not necessarily unreasonable, it astounds me to consider how
many Online users actually compose original drafts of _huge_ works
exclusively within publishing and blogging services like *Medium*,
*Tumblr*, or *Reddit*, even. We currently cohabitate a literary sphere
with
https://kotaku.com/this-smash-bros-fan-fiction-has-3-5-million-words-s-899629991[impossibly
massive works of fanfiction] that far surpass anything God or The
Classics established in the past, and it‚Äôs a wonder how many
http://bit.ly/redvonnegut[sour habits] have crept into the writing world
as a result. For the sake of the experiment (and
http://bit.ly/futureland9[my own education],) I posted some of my recent
work on https://medium.com/@ficklecrux[*Medium*] and found its
composition UI much improved from what I remember and comparable in many
ways to those of more recent dedicated document editing/notetaking
services, but there‚Äôs still whole set of abstract, less-than-technical
reasons not to _publish_ on Medium, much less compose there.

Briefly: instead of
‚Äúhttps://blog.medium.com/renewing-mediums-focus-98f374a960be[defining a
new model for media on the internet],‚Äù CEO Ev Williams and company ended
up creating an isolationist community with
https://medium.freecodecamp.org/how-to-write-medium-stories-people-will-actually-read-92e58a27c8d8[hellishly-skewed
priorities in craft]. Virtually all of what‚Äôs actually _born_ on Medium
is of a certain soulsucking, less-than-productive quality (notable
exceptions include https://medium.com/@ryandeel[Ryan Dell],
https://medium.com/@davepell[Dave Pell], and work from marginalized
voices that would not otherwise be written or published.) Though their
founding principles of ad-model disruption are redeemable and entirely
sincere, I‚Äôm sure, their result doesn‚Äôt actually solve anything at all,
especially after
https://www.recode.net/2017/1/4/14169348/medium-layoffs-ad-business-model-change[last
year‚Äôs layoffs and refocus].

As for *Tumblr* and *Reddit*, I‚Äôm afraid I‚Äôve never been capable of
truly understanding either, but I did blog extensively about cars for
the first time 5‚Äì6 years ago on the former when it was one of
significantly fewer fee-free options for digital publishing, and even
then the experience was already casting doubt on the true necessity and
existence of blogging platforms like WordPress‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääespecially for web
development-abhorring peons like I was at the time. Now, its iOS app is
gorgeous, and its editor has ended up rock-solid and surprisingly
versatile, yet the state of its community, also, leaves one with little
reason to publish aside from a sortof isolationist desire to contribute
to _the community itself_, for Tumblr‚Äôs sake.

This is where *WordPress* should outshine everything else as a pure,
open-source Content Management System for any and every use by any and
every folk with server space, so I thought I‚Äôd try out
http://extratone.com/shife[my own fresh, ultra-connected install] to see
how its experience has changed. In word processing terms, its
https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/wordpress/id335703880[iOS] and
https://apps.wordpress.com/d/windows/[Windows] clients are _lightyears_
ahead of where they were a few years ago, but to take full advantage of
them, one must allow WordPress‚Äô own software access that‚Äôs
https://www.wpexplorer.com/jetpack-wordpress-plugin/[not _Open Web_ at
all]. For light, minimalist personal blogs, a WordPress site offers much
more control over one‚Äôs intellectual property than Medium or Tumblr, but
it‚Äôs also significantly less independent than it once was. A quick
inspection of my little experiment reveals that 5 out of its 6 content
sources are from Google or WordPress properties, leaving only one for
_my_ actual server. This means I can accomplish a lot using just their
apps, and my work will be distributed among ‚Äúbillions of posts‚Äù across
WordPress dot com (to be found by absolutely nobody, I suspect,) but the
post editor within the CMS itself has never functioned quite so
versatility as it does right now. And yet, neither WordPress nor any of
the software I‚Äôve covered thus far achieve much progress toward an
ideal, comprehensive word processing solution.

image:xhtml/https:/i.snap.as/wDQtaPk.png[Dropbox Paper]

That‚Äôs why I‚Äôd like to talk about *Dropbox Paper*, which has been my own
browser‚Äôs homepage and primary text editor since
https://www.theverge.com/2016/8/4/12373696/dropbox-paper-ios-android-sharing-docs[its
public beta went live] in August of 2016, and it‚Äôs very hard not to dote
on considering that it is definitively the single most useful software
addition in my whole computing life. It‚Äôs a live-updating exclusively
web-based (for now) service with an emphasis on collaboration, just like
the industry-standard monstrosity that is *Google Docs*, but it‚Äôs been
designed from the ground-up to perform best the operations you need most
from a word processor in 2018, which doesn‚Äôt include advanced layouts,
fine-adjustable paragraph and/or letter spacing, Excel integration, or
voice dictation, but simply‚Ä¶ typing and re-reading and editing. You‚Äôd be
surprised what a handy productivity catalyst can become of a simple
white, live-updating space without distraction available no matter where
you are or what device you‚Äôre in reach of.

Virtually _all_ of my ‚Äúprocess‚Äù is now conducted within Paper, and I‚Äôve
never before experienced such an unconscious assimilation of use. I
write about software because I‚Äôve used a lot of it and I‚Äôve been able to
count on my ability to find fundamental mistakes/designed ignorance in
most everything. Dropbox Paper, however, is so keenly perfect for my own
needs that I slipped unconsciously into total, daily dependence upon it
without noticing the transition at all, which has never, _ever_ happened
before. Notes can begin from blank Text/Title fields to _Brainstorming_,
_Meeting Notes_, and _Project Overview_ templates. In April, the team
https://blogs.dropbox.com/dropbox/2018/04/dropbox-paper-templates/[introduced
the ability] to ‚Äútemplatize‚Äù any document, which I‚Äôve yet to explore but
will no doubt make full use of for show notes when
http://extratone.com/futureland[_Futureland_] is revived. There are also
https://blog.evernote.com/blog/2017/05/05/uncovering-templates-hidden-gem-evernote/[Evernote
templates], yes, but you cannot create your own, and downloading them is
an unnecessary pain in the ass.

image:xhtml/https:/i.snap.as/kn7b2Tx.png[Dropbox Paper Search]

Landing on the root, you‚Äôll see Folders, Starred Folders, Starred
Entries, and Shared Documents all displayed chronologically by
modification date. Instead of tags, categories, or ‚Äúnotebooks,‚Äù Dropbox
Paper‚Äôs folders are its singular method of categorization, and they are
astoundingly sufficient, even when editing multiple documents
simultaneously or digging through professional and personal entries
within a single account‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääall thanks to its search function, which is
super-swift and superior to any other service because of its profound
simplicity. It‚Äôs one of many experiences which laughably shame past
efforts in the design of these tools: without any customizable search
filters or metadata and https://www.dropbox.com/help/paper/find-docs[by
sifting only through title, content, and author], any note in Paper can
be found _instantly_ no matter how dated or obscure. I doubt I‚Äôve yet to
top 1000 entries quite yet (there‚Äôs no easy way to count, and _why
should there be_, really,) but on several occasions I‚Äôve found
years-untouched, untitled documents within seconds‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääa process which has
_never_ been brisk or convenient in Evernote.

Though Dropbox Paper wasn‚Äôt necessarily designed for composing
5000+-word longform, it‚Äôs by far the best tool for the vast majority of
the pre-publishing process (to a reasonable extent, of course‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäI
wouldn‚Äôt use it for a screenplay or novel manuscript.) It‚Äôs rare for me
to utilize its mastery of collaboration, these days, but there‚Äôs frankly
little reason to go anywhere else‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääincluding Google Docs‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääconsidering
that Paper documents can be bound by the same viewing and editing
permissions: by individual entry or folder, marking live modifications
with clean, color-coded initials in the sidebar, by email or rogue URL
for editing, commenting, and/or reading. (The comments interface is the
best I‚Äôve ever seen by a wide margin.) Users can be assigned and
‚Äúpinged‚Äù for tasks using ‚Äú@,‚Äù and it‚Äôs reasonable to assume that
permissions won‚Äôt ever present an issue for my own use considering they
haven‚Äôt already. To a limited extent, notes can be easily ‚Äúpublished‚Äù
via shared links yet remain editable in realtime, making Paper perfect
for obscure-but-public reference documents like
http://extratone.com/style[our style guide] and
http://extratone.com/redirection[redirects catalog].

From the onset of use, you‚Äôll marvel at how fucking fast and smooth the
in-browser experience is regardless of your device‚Äôs age or dimensions.
Surprise surprise‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääthe iOS app works just as smoothly and is laid out
vaguely like a Twitter client. ‚ÄúBrowse‚Äù‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääthe chronological timeline of
documents‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääoccupies the leftmost bottom button as ‚ÄúHome‚Äù‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääthe main
timeline‚Ää‚Äî‚Äädoes in Twitter‚Äôs app, and ‚ÄúNotifications‚Äù is likewise the
same icon (practically) in the same position in both, and the items
themselves are even grouped with rich card-looking content previews.
Perhaps these nods to my Twitter muscle memory have contributed to my
own unusual bias, but I suspect it shares components with a particular
demographic of professional writers. As I understand the day-to-day
activities of a feet-on-the-pavement reporter, Dropbox Paper is a
necessity in a ridiculously all-encompassing sense. With its Slack
integration,
https://blogs.dropbox.com/dropbox/2017/03/paper-hidden-gems/[super
high-usability design], collaborative modularity, ultra
copy-and-paste-friendly text, smooth hyperlink behavior, light weight,
and ultimate compatibility, it should be evangelized as a no-brainer
option in journalism. _Fuck_ a Bic & steno.

Web Clipping may be completely alien to its vocabulary, but you can drag
and drop documents in just about any format for a beautifully-embedded
preview. Conveniently,
https://www.dropbox.com/help/paper/dropbox-integration[they won‚Äôt even
count against your Dropbox upload quota]: ‚ÄúDropbox Paper doesn‚Äôt place a
limit on the number of docs you can create, and includes unlimited
version history regardless of the Dropbox plan you are on.‚Äù Naturally,
this is subject to change in the future, but I‚Äôm 95% positive that Paper
has yet to refuse any of my uploads because of their size or format, and
many of mine are extraordinarily huge.

There is a perfect power to Paper which I can only beg its stewards to
leave unmolested for as long as possible. If I was a billionaire, I‚Äôd
immediately purchase it from Dropbox and leave everything to the
company‚Ää‚Äî‚Äärevenue, janitorial development, user data, etc.‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääexcept the
right to make any significant feature or functionality additions to the
user experience, as I have never before felt this way about a single
service or program‚Ä¶ _ever_. I‚Äôm not sure if I should keep quiet or
incessantly kiss ass, but my interest undoubtedly lies in preserving
Paper as it is. If you‚Äôre left doubting my own testimonial, there are a
billion throwaway ‚ÄúDitch Google Docs for Dropbox Paper‚Äù posts across the
B and C-list technosphere.
https://www.gizmodo.com.au/2017/02/5-reasons-you-might-ditch-google-docs-for-dropbox-paper/[_Gizmodo‚Äôs_],
for instance, notes Paper‚Äôs superior formatting freedom, intelligent
footprint, incredible embed flexibility, and‚Ä¶ independence from the
terrible Google God.

image:xhtml/https:/i.snap.as/w1nbxBE.png[Dropbox Paper iOS]

Right now, one‚Äôs choices in notetaking apps for iOS are almost _too_
varied. There‚Äôs
https://www.pcmag.com/review/346353/zoho-notebook-for-iphone[*Zoho
Notebook*], which claims itself to be ‚ÄúAn App Store 2016 Best App of the
Year‚Äù (falsely,
https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2016/12/apple-unveils-best-of-2016-across-apps-music-movies-and-more/[it
would appear].) I recall installing it on my 6S Plus, then, after spying
some screenshots of its multicolored notes, but I failed to find room
for its use. When the (completely useless) Files app was added with iOS
11, I played around with it for a bit and somehow ended up setting Zoho
as the default application to open PDFs which inadvertently launched my
8 Plus into an infinite loop of ‚ÄúOpen __ in __?‚Äù prompts that eventually
required deletion of Notebook in order to view them at all. I tend to
especially adore these programs in their early, innocent versions when
they smell most of innovation before their creators are inevitably
brought back to our filthy reality when their VCs start expecting
_money_. Zoho Notebook should have bewitched my affections, but my short
trial was clunky and disastrous and those beautifully-colored layouts
weren‚Äôt quite worth the trouble, so they were missed‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääto no consequence
at all.

The latest favorite is *Bear*, the Markdown-supporting app with which
_The Verge_‚Äôs Casey Newton
https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/2/14785264/evernote-replacement-bear-app[replaced
Evernote for his own use], last year. His authority in writing copy at
huge volume is notable if only for his
https://www.getrevue.co/profile/caseynewton[_daily newsletter on the
business of social media_], which is always unfathomably gargantuan and
clean.

____
Bear lets you tag notes by adding a hashtag to a word anywhere in your
document; you can add as many as you like, and then browse them later
from the left rail. You can export your notes as PDFs, rich text files,
HTML documents, or even JPEGs. And it supports ultra-nerd automation, so
if you use an iOS app like Workflow
**[**https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/4/17414648/siri-update-new-features-apple-wwdc-2018[*now
Shortcuts*]*]* you can create shortcuts to your notes.
____

DayOne‚Äôs own markdown support and exporting capabilities surely make it
Bear‚Äôs predecessor. JPEG exports are a nice touch and they reflect
awareness of what power notetakers like Newton _actually do_ with their
software. If I had not already chosen to
http://bit.ly/spectreinred[depart OSX], long ago, I would seriously
consider downloading the app on both platforms and paying its monthly
$15 membership fee to try out syncing, but I suspect Google‚Äôs moderate
but noticeable influence on their design would quickly prove to be a
turn-off, personally. I had a go at Bear‚Äôs free iOS experience and saw
little functional difference from DayOne‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääif anything, text didn‚Äôt look
quite as sharp‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääbut its reported integration with Siri Shortcuts is
intriguing.
(https://techcrunch.com/2017/03/22/apple-has-acquired-workflow-a-powerful-automation-tool-for-ipad-and-iphone/[Apple
acquired Workflow last year], absorbing it into its upcoming iOS 12
release as Shortcuts.) I‚Äôd suggest you give it a try‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääespecially if
your desktop-class machine is a Mac‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääand for your sake, I would hope
they choose to utilize the power of the modern browser with a web
interface in the future. ‚ÄúAs a writer, I work in text, and text ought to
be simple,‚Äù Newton opined, likely with more brevity than I‚Äôm capable of
in this discussion.

Much of anything has yet to be written about these offerings in 2018,
but I must insist both regular and intermittent writers alike give
Dropbox Paper a try. I suspect you‚Äôve less ‚Äúprivacy‚Äù to ‚Äúlose‚Äù than you
would in Google Docs, and its sublime function as a writing tool extends
from workplace collaboration to shared grocery lists with your SO and
long, image and hyperlink-saturated works like this one. It‚Äôs very
difficult to break‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääeven by pasting fragmenting code or Zalgo text;
it‚Äôs never out of date, and always a short, teeny pageload away even
across the worst of connections. As someone with an unhealthy obsession
with his written work, I can tell you that its UI is by far the most
anxiety-relieving I‚Äôve ever used. As an alternative to Google Docs, I
would point out that 1) Docs supersedes Paper in sum features
_significantly_ less than you‚Äôd think and 2) for the one or two weird
formatting challenges it fails to complete, neither Microsoft Word‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääthe
old bitch‚Ää‚Äî‚Äänor Docs are going anywhere, and Paper exports to both of
them directly.

== The Future

Curiously enough, I was required to use every single method of text
retention of which I am capable in the course of writing this piece, as
I tripped over my laptop‚Äôs charging cable‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääa physical connection, yes
(and with substantial leverage) because Apple won‚Äôt allow other computer
manufacturers to make use of ‚Äútheir‚Äù ingenious magnetic charging
solution which they‚Äôve included as ‚ÄúMagSafe‚Äù on MacBooks since
2008‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääperhaps inevitably ruining the port and leaving me with only my
iPhone and pens. I filled a few folded sheets of paper with
https://www.instagram.com/p/BgErFqhFvyT/[my LAMY Safari] (which is good,
but overrated,) and felt quite ridiculous in the process. Thanks to my
fianc√©‚Äôs generosity, I type this bit now on her Panasonic R440 Electric
Typewriter, which must still be considered a legitimate means of writing
text in 2018 if only because of
https://theoutline.com/post/2488/collin-andrew-yost-the-most-hated-poet-in-portland[Instagram
poetry]. According to
https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00005QT7B/ref=as_li_ss_tl[its rather dubious
listing] on Amazon, this model dates to September 4th, 1973, which is
remarkable considering its spellcheck and auto-margin functions (neither
of which I could actually figure out how to use.) If there is anywhere
to be caught clacking away on a typewriter out of preference (I‚Äôd
hesitate to call even my own situation one of _necessity_,) in 2018, it
would undoubtedly be Portland, yet I am still extremely embarrassed to
be the source of all this racket and would immediately perish if any of
my neighbors bothered to track it down.

Even this very sophisticated example of the typewriting species is
limited by one‚Äôs supply of both ink and erasing ribbon, though either
can still be found for sale, remarkably. I am even less able to easily
correct mistakes than those I wrote by hand because I feel a significant
pang of pain via my mechanical empathy every time I use (or accidentally
misuse) the function which whites out text with a sickening _clunk_.
There‚Äôs something about this process which makes it feel more taxing,
costly, and timeconsuming than any other, but perhaps with time and
extended use, my embarrassment, empathy, and hesitance would fade and
I‚Äôd become a cruel, loaded God of shitty prose, but I have no intention
of finding out. I‚Äôll willingly concede that restored or refurbished
typewriters can be
https://twitter.com/FickleCrux/status/923340941129170944[absolutely
gorgeous], and there‚Äôs probably some validity in the ‚Äúdistraction-free
writing environment,‚Äù but I‚Äôd suggest that anyone who‚Äôs pounded out any
significant chunk of copy knows that one must find a groove of absolute
focus within a word processor in order to complete work with any
efficiency or cohesion, anyway. I‚Äôm as connected as any of you, yet
these days, I always end up _hyperfocused_ on Word, Dropbox Paper,
and/or research in my browser to the exclusion of anything else on the
machine, whether or not I intend to do so. I‚Äôm no authority, but I can‚Äôt
see a functional place for a typewriter in 2018.

Portlanders, surely, are vain enough to avoid leaving such disastrous
drafts laying about, though now‚Äôs a good time to note that one can now
scan their typewritten document into a word processor using native
software on their smartphone, nowadays, if they‚Äôre so unreasonably
inclined. Using iOS default Notes app, I could scan this physical draft
into Portable Document Format with just a few steps, but doing so would
contribute to the ridiculous perception that Adobe‚Äôs ancient, clunky
standard is the ultimate end of the line for any and all digital
publishing. Yes, it‚Äôs ridiculous to consider ‚Äú25 years‚Äù of development
led to PDF 2.0‚Äôs release _just last year_, to nobody‚Äôs glee outside
https://theblog.adobe.com/taking-documents-to-the-next-level-with-pdf-2-0/[_The
Fucking Adobe Blog_] (which I do believe is running on Medium,
hilariously.) Yet throughout my existence, it‚Äôs been the go-to half-step
between text‚Äôs digital and physical forms. The liason, if you will.

Perhaps one could argue that this role in our collective academic
Western word processing lives is profound (though no mentally functional
human being wants to meet _them_,) which would inevitably lead them to
criticize Adobe‚Äôs longtime occupation of it, but to examine the _next_
significant step in the development of word processing is (this moment,
at least) extremely hellish and alarming. This
‚Äúhttps://youtu.be/LxviGskApcw[Virtual Reality prototype],‚Äù for instance,
surpasses even _The Soul Ledger_ as the most distressing online video of
all time.

Just *32.3%* of survey respondents claim they print ‚Äú*at least one draft
and use a pen or pencil to make notes/mark corrections by hand*,‚Äù not
including the additional *6.5%* who ‚Äú*print at least one draft but make
all corrections digitally*,‚Äù leaving *61.3%* who presumably do not
physically print at all throughout their writing process. Our survey is
broad, rudimentary, and not entirely scientific, yes, but I would bet
these numbers would contrast significantly with those from respondents
exclusively in academia. For myself and my colleagues, there remains
‚Äú_something_‚Äù that can only be attained by physically manifesting
written work, perhaps in requirement of tangible manipulation in order
to thoroughly comprehend large bodies of information. As I‚Äôve passed
100,000 words within the rough draft of my novel project, no amount of
skimming on any sized screen has enabled me to catch the typos and
inconsistencies which become _immediately_ obvious as soon as I have the
most current printed manuscript in my hands. I doubt even total
immersion into one‚Äôs work via some VR-capable word processor would do
much to assuage this discrepancy‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääor much at all, for that matter,
aside from casting writers into their own special hell. Surely, only the
most self-loathing of them would voluntarily choose to be so dunked.

The devel¬≠op¬≠ment of https://apple.co/2twLdBA[Jor¬≠dan Hipwell‚Äôs UniChar

by far the more intu¬≠itive and effi¬≠cient of these two sep¬≠a¬≠rate ways

_All of this may one day be worth significantly more revision and/or
visibility in the future, but for now, just know that I rambled out all
of this because it‚Äôs by far my most effective way to think, and this
darned lowkey blog post has just provided a very long-overdue
opportunity for it. Please feel free to read or even respond to it, if
you‚Äôd like, but I‚Äôd like to ask that you don‚Äôt panic or circulate it.
Thanks._

____
So far‚Ä¶ the only intercorrespondence between staff at Inmunis is people
having a problem with one another. +
Before Extratone, there was InmunisÔªø ‚Äì my first, relatively short-lived
attempt to launch an online magazine which wasn‚Äôt particularly
important, but the experience surely did contribute to and inform my
progression in understanding media that led to my (utter bewildered)
current state. Anyhow, it‚Äôs fun to look back. Here‚Äôs the web archive‚Äôs
last snapshot.
____

image:xhtml/https:/i.snap.as/K5yflMu.jpeg[Inmunis Version 1 Web Capture]

This, a derelict Twitter account, and two film reviews by James Wilson
are all that‚Äôs left of inmunis.co.uk for good reasons ‚Äì many of which I
did not entirely shed when I tried again. Until I started Extratone and
made doing ‚Äúthis‚Äù ‚Äì incessantly reading/exploring the web, obsessively
tinkering and experimenting with The Extranet ‚Äì I actually had very
little knowledge on or exposure to the state of digital publishing or
the real depth of variety to be found with any significant effort to
comprehend the current offering real, surviving magazines, online or
not, yet was dumb and arrogant enough to assume that I‚Äôd seen it all and
none of it was even close to good enough for me to read or seek to write
for. I was actually delusional enough to regard myself as too smart and
one-of-a-kind to lower myself by going back to journalism school ‚Äì that
I was so special, anything I put effort in creating was destined to turn
out superb. Granted, I‚Äôd had the actual idea for less than two weeks
before I experienced by far the most traumatic, soul-destroying,
world-upturning, and life-altering event of my entire existence, which I
think accounts for the insanity, and all of my decisions were inevitably
preempted by the fact that I was a 21-year-old straight white male
community college dropout, which accounts for (but does not excuse)
their absurdity.

I‚Äôve publicly implied before that it was probably only thanks to Drycast
‚Äì which was also in its infancy during the time of The Big Event
(episode 7 was published just two days before) ‚Äì and its weekly
obligation to sit down and talk with my favorite people about
interesting stuff that I did not end up dead or institutionalized in
2015 (I wish I was exaggerating.) If there is a Gourd, let it be known
that he is fully up-to-date and brand-activated ‚Äì he sent me a fucking
podcast to save my life.

Reading and compiling stories for the show notes throughout the week
provided an early avenue for exploring and embedding myself into media.
Beyond the actual content, even, it‚Äôs been the rationality in the tone
which journalists generally adhere to that has drawn me in and provided
a brighter and brighter guiding light to help keep my sanity in check
after my world ended because New Media values empathy in tandem with
critical thought. All my life, it‚Äôs been very important to me that I
continue to learn the best way to both appear and feel smart and
functional. I‚Äôve long since accepted that I am very fucking weird ‚Äì and
not in the wow, I dye my hair bright red sort of way which helps people
feel unique, but in the holy shit, I‚Äôm terrified of what would actually
result in losing control of my facade sort, which is actually much less
sinister than it sounds for you, and infinitely moreso for me.

This is why I still have a very infantile habit of becoming
overwhelmingly frustrated with those who socially emphasize and
celebrate their ‚Äúweirdness‚Äù as an important part of their identity
because my self-perception has long since transitioned from regarding my
deviations as something that made me ‚Äúunique,‚Äù to gigantic obstacles in
the way of every possible aspiration which I‚Äôll probably never overcome,
but am doomed to kill myself trying. I‚Äôm now working on learning to
appreciate those very fucking common people who are determined to prove
how strange they are because ultimately, my own self-perception is just
as ignorant, loneliness is not a virtue, and I‚Äôve only maintained the
whole charade because I‚Äôd rather have delusions of grandeur than
acknowledge that I am also mostly unoriginal, and most of my truly more
‚Äúoriginal‚Äù behaviors could easily be described as simply unhealthy.

This is an important confession for this explanation because its
‚Äúsolution‚Äù is another crucial motivation behind my creation of Extratone
‚Äì as both a symbolic and literal means of understanding and minimizing
my own biases and bitterness by 1) surrounding myself with the huge
amount young, talented people I knew with great ideas and 2) editorially
committing to curiosity as the most precious ideal in writing (and in
life.)

I do know that ‚Äì for whatever reason ‚Äì I really do have a special knack
for identifying the culture and creators that are truly fresh,
innovative, even cool among those who can‚Äôt comprehend or stand it and
the heartbreaking number of those who actualize themselves by trying to
act aggressively apathetic toward the status quo. This sense is far from
100% reliable and is certainly not of a greater quality than everyone on
Earth, but I would still confidently suggest it‚Äôs at least better than
most, and ‚Äì as most of us know ‚Äì it especially jives with and defines
the world of magazines.

As I did in Spring 2016, I still believe that Extratone is the best way
for me to hone my greatest talents and shed my biggest problems ‚Äì that
it is the name I can place on my endless journey to improve myself,
which ‚Äì most importantly of all ‚Äì will all the while achieve the
tightest possible adhesion to the only meaning of ‚Äúoriginal‚Äù with any
significance or real world value at all, which serves human curiosity
without punishing it in any sense. I could actually just be crazy or
completely, irrationally inverted ‚Äì and I know it sounds abstract and
preposterous ‚Äì but I promise it‚Äôs my best shot at one day performing my
optimal function for the world.

The very first thing I did after I‚Äôd arrived upon these hypotheses and
been abruptly forced to cling to them as my last hope in life was to
obsessively search for a single mantra/battlecry I could drill into my
memory and could shout under duress ‚Äì including the temptation to escape
the whole lot of it ‚Äì to succinctly remind myself that I had at least
one logical chance at a fulfilling life (and yes, it‚Äôs still funny that
the chance is, in fact, a Web Site.)

Scribam quid non legerim is possibly grammatically incorrect to a
scholar, but it‚Äôs the best possible translation I came up with in my
Latin research of ‚ÄúI will write what I have not read.‚Äù It‚Äôs cheesy, yes,
and a bit cringey in the middle of just any old day when it happens to
catch my eye where it‚Äôs proudly displayed, all-caps, in the footer of
our CMS, and ‚Äì I‚Äôll be honest ‚Äì I don‚Äôt know if I could explain it over
coffee to a stranger without turning red and covering my face, as I once
could, but it‚Äôs (sincerely, in this one Ôªøcase) real gravestone material.
(As in, if someone were to read this after my death, they would be
encouraged to receive it as a bonafide last wish.)

== As the industry endeavors once again to reconcile the cultural and financial incentives of streaming digital music, one independent platform has wavered little from its 10-year-long mission to bring the business to the unsigned artist with elegance and integrity.

If you‚Äôve ever thought to yourself _wow, Bandcamp has looked basically
the same forever_, you were entirely correct ‚Äì now for a tenth of the
century, at least ‚Äì and you‚Äôll be hard-pressed to find another Silicon
Valley technology company toting a venture-funded origin story with such
casual, yet robust long-standing user relationships underneath an
unwavering, bullshit-free commitment to their product. Even under the
most ludicrous scrutiny, the company‚Äôs rudder is flawless and its course
true. What at first glance you‚Äôd swear to be an unsolicited conclusion
to an obscure examination could very reasonably be described as
_cheesy_, _stubborn_, _dweebish_, _pious_, or just generally _boring_,
indeed, yet the respective accuracy of each of these adjectives are no
more than the byproducts of the very same operational ethics which we‚Äôve
suggested, requested, demanded, and begged the rest of the world‚Äôs
computing capitol to re-adopt, enforce, or at least _ponder_ for a beat.
The volume of the masses‚Äô exponentially-increasing attendance of late is
only overcome by its hysterical shouting match, so let us pipe down for
a while, now so that we may be precise as we dig deeper into the
methodology which has finally led to a profitable, drama-free outlying
technology organization without the need for a single drop of analogous
sweat over its brand upkeep. By arranging the company in its infancy to
so precisely and elementally align with the needs of its customers, the
original troupe of Bandcamp Bums ensured profound and lasting simplicity
in the single overarching priority for those in every single role behind
the quiet perpetuation of Bandcamp dot com: *selling good* *music*.

The platform indiscriminately provides both individual artists and
labels with a clean, cozy, charming, smartly-designed and technically
competent storefront with a wide-open storage allocation, optimal search
engine optimization and a widely-trusted point of sale experience in
exchange for 15% of any sales that should come in ‚Äì
https://medium.com/@gloom303/a-year-ago-i-released-an-ep-on-spotify-itunes-and-bandcamp-this-is-what-i-l-earned-872925797930[significantly
less] than other channels; _half_ what Apple Music will take. In
examining Bandcamp‚Äôs history, its impact on independent music, and its
viability as an alternative streaming service, we shall excavate the
truth behind the derisive cynicism directed its way by the titans of the
tech and music press. Over the course of this super link-laden journey,
we‚Äôd consider the alarmingly hypocritical possibility that it‚Äôs been
overlooked by mainstream conversations only because it has so long
operated in the precise manner we claim is so hopelessly absent from its
neighbors in its deliberate, principled, and innovative journey towards
a transparent, progressive vision.

To catch our starting gun, we must first travel to _Face The Music 2016_
in Melbourne ‚Äì as far as one can possibly get from The Valley ‚Äì
alongside Bandcamp‚Äôs super-worldly Chief Curator,
https://bandcamp.com/andrewjervis[Andrew Jervis] to observe his
interview for a live audience.

____
Bandcamp has always grown extremely organically. There‚Äôs never actually
been any advertising that we‚Äôve done; there‚Äôs never any advertising on
the site, and there never will be. We haven‚Äôt really tooted our horn
very hard.
____

In fact, just about everything from the shrewd idealism of those who
beget its conception to the on-the-nose care in their person-to-person
customer service is so adamantly inverse of the tech industry archetype
which the global End User community at large are presently discovering
at twice the speed of sound there should _at least_ be some
conspiratorializing going around. Where I come from, launching a
desolate business to little mainstream success with persistence and
dignified determination is (or should be) regarded as a telltale sign
that one is running a front (according to the television, anyway,) but
exploration of this plausibility yielded nothing in Bandcamp‚Äôs case,
even after I took the risk of incrimination and begged a certain
Boston-based future funk producer to accept my ginormous bribe and
include _any_ sort of pharmacological substance with his summer beat
tape. He wouldn‚Äôt even send antihistamines.

As uncomfortably as it lands on the soul, no moniker describes Bandcamp
more comprehensively than ‚Äúan online record store.‚Äù As far as
https://youtu.be/inzhStQJFQw[Ethans] go, Bandcamp‚Äôs CEO and founders‚Äô
public attach√© Ethan Diamond is as good as they come: it‚Äôs quite telling
that he is the only Silicon Valley CEO who‚Äôs remained intellectually
grounded enough with the rest of us in order to retain any skills in
nuanced forms of verbal communication like‚Ä¶ humor. The closest the
company has ever come to promotion? His awkward, sub-20-minute
https://youtu.be/MaUkS-lr-ZM[presentation] at the XOXO Festival 2014
offered an impressively succinct introduction to their greater mission
considering the unmistakable agony in his body language.

‚ÄúWe worked out of the public library for the first four years of the
company's existence,‚Äù he admits. Impressively, Bandcamp was operated
entirely as a ‚Äúvirtual company‚Äù until 2015.

Either Bandcamp just happens to be the single Silicon Valley company
where the executives are unanimously so fucking fulfilled by their work
without exception that they aren‚Äôt compelled to leave it long enough to
stumble upon the inevitable coastal colleague with a connection to
something like The Internet History Podcast, or technology journalism
has definitively lost all reverence for actual innovation in favor of
the
https://www.bcg.com/en-us/publications/2018/ideas-emotions-innovation-riding-amazement-cycle.aspx[emotionally-charged]
Innovation Myth, now
https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/24/17610348/twitter-elon-musk-display-name-change-lock-account-crypto-scams[relinquished
almost entirely] to the narrative control of its own protagonists.
Perhaps it was inevitable that Elon Musk, Sundar Pichai, Mark
Zuckerberg, and Jeff Bezos would become immortalized as ‚Äúthose who make
things happen,‚Äù but our ability to quantify value as consumers tends to
scurry rapidly away behind our backs when they‚Äôre turned by the constant
distraction of these mostly inert figureheads. As their personalities
have stolen the story, the people in industry with their hands on real
product have all but completely disappeared from the frame, and all of
the work remaining at the End User‚Äôs eye level was abandoned by
aspiration long ago and replaced with the unfulfilling mechanism of A
Quick Buck. Though now we are proceeding into a similar frame ‚Äì only
because our subject cares more about their mission than claiming
recognition for it and might just be the first such company run by a
cast who become sincerely defensive at the suggestion of a cash-out.

‚ÄúBandcamp‚Äôs philosophy has always been very different [from] a lot of
the companies we‚Äôre surrounded by,‚Äù reflects Jervis. ‚ÄúWe are not a
‚Äòlet‚Äôs-raise-money-and-burn-through-it‚Äô type of company.‚Äù

I know that your mind has been trained by years of engagement with the
digital media of a rapidly-globalizing, venture capital-obsessed society
to block the passage of this sort of language across your conscious
threshold at risk of life-threatening overexposure to the Medium Dialect
and its churnalising neoliberal cyberchode scholars of the Personal
Brand; I know you‚Äôve read the exact same quote from how many
entrepreneurs in how many worthless, masturbatory business magazine
profiles, but I swear on my one-of-a-kind Estonian Hilary Duff pullout
that Jervis speaks without irony or deception. how many fucking
churnicles have abandoned you, but this time, it‚Äôs actually sincere.

[[section0050.xhtml#on-the-web]]
== On The Web

Though Bandcamp was technically the first comprehensive library-modeled
music streaming service in existence, the topical conversations between
both technology and music journalists and industry executives flooding
both podcast and news feeds at the moment orbiting the ‚ÄúCord-Cutting‚Äù
phenomena as it‚Äôs washed over television, cinema, and music are rooted
in the same building blocks as the core technology behind the delivery
of all of these conversations as well as their subjects, funny enough.
As long as my subgeneration has known it, The Web has been a source of
sound in some manifestation, but the example with the most perplexing
history was also the first. Today, one of five tabs in the main menu of
my iPhone‚Äôs native music app contains the text ‚ÄúRadio‚Äù beneath an
‚Äúantenna with waves‚Äù graphic which opens a service once called
https://web.archive.org/web/20150608143103/https:/www.apple.com/itunes/itunes-radio/[iTunes
Radio] that was absorbed into ‚Äì and
https://www.theverge.com/2016/1/15/10777790/itunes-radio-apple-music-january-28[restricted
to subscribers of] ‚Äì Apple Music as of 2016, confusingly. However, both
‚ÄúiTunes Radio‚Äù and ‚ÄúApple Music Radio(?)‚Äù ‚Äì along with any and all audio
streaming services (mentioned and not) ‚Äì are fundamentally nothing more
than different UX design interpretations of the ‚Äúsimple‚Äù practice of
streaming an audio file, which made its debut at the turn of the century
in the form of ‚ÄúInternet Radio.‚Äù Astonishingly, the protocol ‚Äì still
referred to by at least one person on Earth as ‚ÄúWebcasting,‚Äù no doubt ‚Äì
has survived nearly 20 years, and even the youngest of us have likely
encountered it in unusual situations.

Ironically, the http://radio.garden/[majority] of Internet Radio
broadcasts remaining on the air are nothing more than live duplicates of
the traditional radio wave-bound products from the physical stations
your car‚Äôs head unit receives. Even the current desktop version of
iTunes maintains support for streaming ‚Äúaudio files over the internet,‚Äù
though a glance at
https://support.apple.com/kb/PH19478?locale=en_US[Apple‚Äôs dated support
page] for the process suggests it hasn‚Äôt crossed anybody‚Äôs mind for at
least half of that history. In 1994, the publicly-funded radio network
Voice of America became the
‚Äúhttp://www.chriskern.net/history/voaFirstOnTheInternet.html[First
[radio] on the Internet]‚Äù when it
https://groups.google.com/forum/?hl=en#!original/rec.radio.shortwave/2pQ9KUYmLqo/wqhhXS2k-lAJ[began]
‚Äì after an introduction by Al Gore, no less ‚Äì ‚Äúoffering digitized audio
versions of selected newscasts and other program segments in 15
languages on its public internet server on Monday, Aug. 15,‚Äù according
to former engineer Chris Kern. However ‚Äì since we‚Äôre already this deep
into internet history ‚Äì a distinction must be established between
streaming static files and streaming live audio. The first relies on
pre-recorded audio files uploaded to a publicly-accessible server ‚Äì in
Kern‚Äôs original case, ‚Äúvia anonymous FTP and the Internet Gopher
protocol,‚Äù which continues to be the elemental process behind every
audio file streamed across the Web (including those on Bandcamp, Apple
Music, Spotify, etc.) more or less because it ain‚Äôt broke.

Semantically, ‚Äúlive‚Äù digital audio streaming in its aforementioned
‚Äúpurest‚Äù form is more or less exclusive to Internet Radio. Obscured
aside from the traditional station simulcast, Web-only Internet Radio
stations have their own of
‚Äúhttps://www.thestar.com/business/2007/04/09/web_radio_may_stream_north_to_canada.html[the
Internet‚Äôs quiet success stories],‚Äù filled with quaint experiences and
an endless cycle of death proclamations which continue to be disproven,
anywise.

On June 27th, 1999, _The Seattle Times_ ran
http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19990627&slug=2968794[an
especially worthwhile introduction to the concept] that likely
represents the only major newspaper‚Äôs mention of SHOUTcast (the first
and likely last name in DIY Web DJing) in the history of the printed
word within a work of truly phenomenal tech reporting on Mark Mataassa‚Äôs
part. From the past, one will find his chillingly spot-on foresight and
well-considered observations are bestrewed with mind-boggling hilarity
when they look.

Dialing in to the Net through a 56 kilobit-per-second modem, as I am,
this seems like a ridiculous waste ‚Äì or at least misallocation ‚Äì of
resources.

I'm using a $3,000 machine, tying up a phone line and seriously
compromising my computing power for an experience that in sound quality,
simplicity and dependability can't compare, truthfully, with the $9
Emerson clock radio an arm's length away.

And yet Web radio is one of the hottest ideas going in the ever-hot
world of Internet startups and acquisitions: In the past few months,
America Online and Yahoo! each have purchased fast-growing Web music
sites, rock-music trendsetters like Rolling Stone and MTV have gotten
into the business, and technological improvements ‚Äì from Microsoft's
newest browser and Real Networks' newest player to the latest MP3
enhancements ‚Äì are closing the quality and accessibility gaps.

The combination of developments is not only changing how computers (and
radios) are used, but offering a glimpse of a future when audience
demographics are sliced ultra-thin ‚Äì to the person ‚Äì and everybody has
the potential to be a radio broadcaster as well as listener.

I only have a few experiences with Internet Radio of my own, but they‚Äôre
all rampantly more memorable than one would expect. The now in-stasis
https://twitter.com/nwireradio[NWIRE] project was by the most relevantly
intriguing and
https://soundcloud.com/themartmusic/nwire-radio-guest-mix-11-feb-2017[savvily-curated]
home for a diverse host of electronic musicians I‚Äôve ever come across ‚Äì
it was my second default browser tab for most of 2017, when I‚Äôd even
listen to the odd-hour broadcasts overseen by just the automated
library-perusing bot for hours. On
https://anchor.fm/extratone/episodes/Juke-Master-Samantha-Carter-and-the-Producers-Extravaganza-e1neqc/a-a4674c[episode
16 of _Drycast_], I recounted https://clyp.it/mps4yfyv[the absurd tale]
of my surprise morning encounter with a Norwegian station‚Äôs live
broadcast from some European breakcore club, which was likely
responsible for the most fun I‚Äôve ever had working in retail.

<a href="http://ultrademon.bandcamp.com/album/seapunk">Seapunk by
Ultrademon</a>

_Extratone_‚Äôs former Tech Editor is partial to a station called
http://www.radioswissjazz.ch/en[Radio Swiss Jazz], which appears to be
thriving in comparison with most visible broadcasters, and
unapologetically emits a bizarre amalgamation of tunes both
chart-topping and Seriously Obscure across every conceivable genre
(including Marching Music,) and continent of origin. Between every few
charts, the brief commentary and station identification has provided our
own private mystery: Was that one pre-recorded? This guy was on
yesterday, but has since shed his accent? However, these tiny temporary
mysteries are Internet Radio‚Äôs only remaining value for us, and I
suspect the same is true for all but the most laggard laggards. For as
long as I‚Äôve been coherent enough to disseminate between much of
anything, very few of its visible offerings have offered anything
groundbreaking or fresh, perhaps out of negligence (one can very easily
arrange leave a machine running SHOUTcast to shuffle through a given
library of music and/or podcasts indefinitely,) frustration, or economic
necessity.

Crucially, the truly _most_ critical consequences and contributions
provided by the pioneers of Internet Radio to our current digital
streaming experience were centered within intellectual property
legislation and advertising-supported business. Unfortunately, this
juncture marks our complete departure from my wheelhouse, but
thankfully, a few sacred accounts of one of technology‚Äôs foremost
confusing clashes with the ill-equipped, technoilliterate monoliths of
the American justice system do indeed remain. As early as 2002, the
ineffable Doc Searls reported on a document authored by the Library of
Congress‚Äô Copyright Royalty Board called
‚Äúhttps://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2016/05/02/2016-09707/determination-of-royalty-rates-and-terms-for-ephemeral-recording-and-webcasting-digital-performance[Determination
of Royalty Rates and Terms for Ephemeral Recording and Webcasting
Digital Performance of Sound Recordings]‚Äù for _Linux Journal_ in an
encyclopedic breakdown of its implications ironically entitled
‚Äúhttps://www.linuxjournal.com/article/6218[Why Are So Many Internet
Radio Stations Still on the Air]?‚Äù I would hope my comprehension is
sufficient to declare that _this was no Cambridge Analytica_: only a few
years subsequent the technology‚Äôs inception, operators within the
Internet Radio business faced serious and immediate fines for their
pre-enforcement distribution of copyrighted material stretching _four
years_ back ‚Äì the severity of which the Doc suggested would ‚Äúsurely
bankrupt many of the individual broadcasters that have been pioneering
this marketplace for the longest time.‚Äù

____
Unlike the commercial radio stations we hear on the old-fashioned
airwaves, Internet radio stations' primary market relationship isn't
with advertisers; it's with listeners. In many cases, the listeners are
the primary source of revenue. This business model is similar to that of
noncommercial (public) radio, only the market relationship is much more
direct and efficient. Internet radio stations don't need to stop
programming to hold marathon whine-fests begging listeners to call phone
volunteers and pledge money to qualify for a mug or a t-shirt. Listeners
simply click on a PayPal or an Amazon link, and after a few more clicks
they've made a payment.

By
https://web.archive.org/web/20100330102643/http:/directory.google.com/Top/Arts/Music/Sound_Files/MP3/Streaming/Stations[March,
2010], just 374 stations were aggregated in Google‚Äôs Internet Radio
Directory, and my own quick sample from its list unfortunately indicated
that most are now silent, but SHOUTcast has yet to be abandoned after
all this time and we can safely suppose the core architecture of the
internet will remain recognizable enough to support it until after we‚Äôre
all dead, rendering the necessary tools indefinitely ready and
accessible should new projects in NWIRE‚Äôs vein come along (I know of no
better fate I could wish upon the protocol.) From Internet Radio‚Äôs
pioneer days, we must skip over a whole era to close in on Bandcamp‚Äôs
origin in the very brightest peak of Web 2.0.

Again, we find ourselves in 2008 and nobody knows what an iPhone is, but
the same classic rock-worshiping, upper-middle class, white collar Early
Majority who first loved Internet Radio are now rapidly and delightedly
distributing links to something called ‚ÄúPandora dot com‚Äù between AOL and
Hotmail inboxes. True luxury music reproduction comes in the form of
Beats headphones motivated by a 320GB iPod Classic. Budding audiophiles
and backpacker dweebs illegally torrent lossless .FLACs to play over
their Christmas-gifted studio monitors with WinAmp, which they‚Äôve set up
to impeccably ‚Äúscrobble‚Äù their history with every played track to their
Last.fm profiles. Everybody else is still buying music from iTunes.
(Those who cannot afford to buy the music they intend to add to their
libraries transition to the music nerd classification as soon as they‚Äôve
sought out a way to obtain it free.) ‚ÄúStreaming‚Äù comes from subscription
services like Rhapsody (now Napster,) which are

their iPhone OS app] in July, but the limited performance of the
handset‚Äôs EDGE network will render it a poor alternative to onsite .mp3s
for years to come.

In January, to minimal acclaim, Oddpost‚Äôs Ethan Diamond launched
Bandcamp, the startup with programmer friends Joe Holt, Shawn
Grunberger, and Neal Tucker to be ‚Äúa sortof WordPress for musicians‚Äù ‚Äì
an easily-created, well-designed landing page to showcase one‚Äôs digital
music files. As Holt laments in http://htmltimes.com/band-camp.php[an
interview with] _The HTML Times_, creating an online presence for your
music had long been ‚Äúa pain in the ass.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou need to find a place to host it, you‚Äôve gotta get the metadata
right, it‚Äôs just hard. So we just decided we would do that hard part for
musicians so that they didn‚Äôt have to be so nerdy.‚Äù

As an address to all of their shared complaints about the experience of
online music distribution up to that point,
https://web.archive.org/web/20090716104620/http:/bandcamp.com[early
Bandcamp] was an astounding piece of engineering. The quaint,
unsurprisingly crate-digger-looking Ethan Diamond ‚Äì who‚Äôs more or less
remained the singular public face of the company since the very
beginning ‚Äì began a brand tradition of transparently music-nerdy
correspondence with his
https://daily.bandcamp.com/2008/09/16/hello-cleveland/[first post on the
Bandcamp blog], explaining the solutions the team had come up with in
greater detail.

____
We keep your music streaming and downloading quickly and reliably,
whether it‚Äôs 3am on a Sunday, or the hour your new record drops and
Pitchfork gives it a scathingly positive review. We make your tracks
available in every format under the sun, so the audiophilic nerderati
can have their FLAC and eat mp3 v2. We adorn your songs with all the
right metadata, so they sail into iTunes with artwork, album, band and
track names intact. We mutter the various incantations necessary to keep
your site top-ranked in Google, so when your fans search for your hits,
they find your music long before they find bonkersforlyrics.com or
iMyFace. We give your fans easy ways to share your music with their
friends, and we give you gorgeous tools that reveal exactly how your
music is spreading, so you can fan the fire.
____

The launch garnered very little attention from tech or music
publications of the time, but
https://waxy.org/2008/09/bandcamp_launch/[Andy Baio‚Äôs interview with
Diamond] provides a substantial, technically in-depth picture of just
how revolutionary and necessary it was. Most of what has continued to
make Bandcamp such an essential tool was present at the very beginning:
server-side stats and metadata (a unique architectural undertaking, no
doubt,) track and album-oriented pagination, and a robust,
easily-embedded Flash player.

Study https://vimeo.com/1739268[Diamond‚Äôs first ‚Äúscreencast‚Äù] alongside
a https://vimeo.com/1857085[video tour of SoundCloud] from the period
and you‚Äôll notice just how much more functional, future-proofed and
_dignified_ Bandcamp appeared in comparison. As apprehensive as I am to
be caught arguing for minimalism over good design, it‚Äôs made perfect
sense in the use case of _this one platform_, which knew _exactly_ what
it was from birth, along with what it would _always_ be, apparently,
which is such a bizarre reversal of the archetypes and the relentless
common narrative we know from The Valley‚Äôs legends. Ethan first shows
the consumer‚Äôs experience ‚Äì none of which has changed after a whole
decade aside from quality-specific track purchases ‚Äì before delving into
the artist-side UI, beginning with the statistics tool, which included
playback and search insights to a depth that was (and still is) unheard
of from a free service. Then, he demonstrates the publishing process
from upload to playback: adding album art, setting a release date, and
pricing its purchase. Aside from their removal of the old waveform
visualizer (I couldn‚Äôt find any record of an announcement of this
decision, official or otherwise,) Bandcamp has changed absolutely
_nothing_ of what‚Äôs shown in Diamond‚Äôs tutorial. In the next few months,
they would add

address capture], and
https://daily.bandcamp.com/2009/01/23/custom-domains-custom-domains/[support
for custom domains]. By October 2008, they‚Äôd made enough waves to be

https://venturebeat.com/2008/10/22/facebook-music-is-getting-its-act-together/[Facebook
Music] was a legitimate property as well, but I do not remember anything
about it at all‚Äîpondering an alternate reality in which _The_ Social
Network became the dominant online music streaming platform leads to a
bizarre comparison of Neil Diamond and Mark Zuckerberg which I can‚Äôt
imagine being altogether productive. Suffice it to say, the two
founders‚Äô visions differ greatly.

== Musicblogocide

Contextually, it‚Äôs also important that we dwell for a moment on the
legal and financial hullabaloo surrounding music sales during Bandcamp‚Äôs
first formative years, and the federal government‚Äôs losing battle to
interpret, enforce, or replace intellectual property law for the
information age. As the Web had grown exponentially more capable and
accessible as a means of audio file distribution, it had become
absolutely saturated with blatantly DRM-circumventing .mp3s and .wavs.
For years, the quickest way to follow up on a _check it out_ sort of
music recommendation was simply to search Google for its track name
followed by ‚Äú.mp3.‚Äù If the first go didn‚Äôt yield success, even the most
rudimentary application of cryptography ‚Äì like substituting some
variation of ‚Äúnsilmtic.rar‚Äù to find a download for Nas‚Äô _Illmatic_, for
instance ‚Äì was a sure bet for one‚Äôs second try, which would often return
several copies just laying around Google-indexed WordPress media
libraries, though results hosted on Mediafire were a preferable
alternative. This was the establishment into which my first adolescent
digital music discoveries were borned, and I‚Äôm still convinced that 99%
of us participants were completely without malice. I‚Äôd argue heartily
that music‚Äôs brief escape from the tireless grip of the record industry
as its only medium stumbled into digital form would be clearly shown to
have a net gain for the whole of American recording artists if you could
measure and plot it, including the past, present, and future use of
peer-to-peer sharing.

2010 would prove to be The Year of Reckoning for the fraction of
DRM-violating traffic on the _visible_ Web, at least. Though it‚Äôd be
virtually impossible to quantify, is it only reasonable to assume that
many siteowners made some real money from the ad impressions that
directly resulted from their unauthorized hosting and
Mediafire-embedding, but let‚Äôs consider how minuscule even the most
outrageously liberal overestimate would be, side-by-side with the
billions in additional revenue YouTube has raked in from the same music
since assuming their place as the de facto platform for quickly
summoning just about any work of audio that‚Äôs ever taken digital form.
It was in February of that year that Blogger (another Google property)
https://blogger.googleblog.com/2010/02/quick-note-about-music-blog-removals.html[deleted
six music blogs] from its platform in response to complaints about
allegedly DMCA-violating .mp3s. _The Registry_
https://www.theregister.co.uk/2010/02/11/google_musicblogocide_2010/[insisted]
the collective finger be pointed at the Digital Millennium Copyright
Act, itself.

‚ÄúIt would seem the music bloggers aren't versed in the ways of DMCA
claims and counterclaims. But you can't blame Google for that,‚Äù they
concluded, after one of the blog‚Äôs founders expressed some of the most
personally-dramatic words mine empathy has yet faced as
https://www.theguardian.com/music/2010/feb/11/google-deletes-music-blogs[quoted
in The Guardian].

‚ÄúIt's just sad because we were documenting young people's music from all
around the globe. For a lot of people, it was music they wouldn't have
been able to discover elsewhere.‚Äù

In hindsight, ‚Äúblame‚Äù is an even more useless avenue of one‚Äôs attention
than usual, especially when one party (Google) was 100% exempt from any
consequences all along. The alarming takeaway is not the DMCA‚Äôs
deftness, but that *Google had the freedom to wait for a parallel
business incentive before deciding the law applied to them*.

Frankly, we should all have realized long ago just how fucking futile it
is to attempt to control any file traffic. Every desktop-class browser
ships with the capability to capture any streamable media on the Web
with a handful of keystrokes ‚Äì it‚Äôd take a maximum of 20 minutes to
bestow upon even the most casual user the knowledge they‚Äôd need to keep
every single track, YouTube video, and Twitch stream they‚Äôd ever watch,
100% legally without a single third-party service/extension interaction,
but the crucial question remains to what end, exactly? It‚Äôs easy, but
it‚Äôs not exactly a fun way to spend an afternoon. The only two
rationales that‚Äôd justify capturing streamed Web files at scale are 1)
the totally bonkers inclination that any given property/ies is likely to
disappear from the entire World Wide Web, ever or 2) the increasingly
rarefying expectation of prolonged time away from internet access.

As Bandcamp has stood so obdurately still, the mainstream music
streaming sphere has expanded titanically around it as if enveloping the
Indie platform in a surrealist timelapse within the eye of a ruinous
tech industry cyclone, which would explosively expand the market into a
ghoulish, filthy monstrosity beyond anything we‚Äôd recognize from the
rule of the WinAmp Hipster, long ago. *Today, the coolest and most rabid
daily music listeners I know all have Spotify memberships*, joining
https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/4/16850742/spotify-subscriber-count-70-million-users[70
million others] globally as of January. For most, it‚Äôs how they prefer
to swaddle their lives in a constant soundtrack ‚Äì at work, in the car,
at school, then at home on the television. For many, it‚Äôs how they
‚Äúexplore‚Äù new music outside of peer and social recommendations... or,
that‚Äôs how the narrative was supposed to go, anyway. Those folks I know
who actually create music, however, are rarely seen using Spotify‚Äîeven
after they‚Äôve endured untold horrors in order to publish their own music
there‚Äîbecause the real story of its track record as a place to
‚ÄúDiscover‚Äù new artists, genres, or sounds is completely abysmal. When
2017‚Äôs streaming data began coming in this past January, a popular
feature by http://galaxie500.bandcamp.com/[Galaxie 500]‚Äôs Damon
Krukowski was run by the definitively terminal music magazine of broad
notoriety‚Äî_Pitchfork_‚Äîentitled
‚Äúhttps://pitchfork.com/features/oped/how-to-be-a-responsible-music-fan-in-the-age-of-streaming/[How
to Be a Responsible Music Fan in the Age of Streaming],‚Äù which he began
by citing some very alarming statistics.

‚Äú*More than 99 percent of audio streaming is of the top 10 percent
most-streamed tracks* [on Spotify.] Which means less than 1 percent of
streams account for all other music.‚Äù

Why? A brazen disregard for necessary meta information, for one.

‚ÄúLook now at how badly their applications already serve entire genres of
less popular music. Spotify lists recordings by song title, album title,
or featured artist name. But that information is so limited it leaves
out even the other performers on a recording, a crucial aspect to
classical and jazz.‚Äù

Alarming for those of us who intend to create or consume any music
separate the Top 40, anyway, which one should feel justified expecting
from most people, most of the time. Last month, The Carters released an
album on which
https://www.bustle.com/p/when-will-everything-is-love-be-on-spotify-beyonce-jay-z-fans-may-have-to-wait-to-stream-the-surprise-album-update-9426616[even
Beyonc√©] identified the problematic service by name. ‚ÄúPatiently waiting
for my demise ‚Äòcause my success can‚Äôt be quantified,‚Äù she rapped, ‚Äúif I
gave two fucks about streaming numbers woulda put Lemonade up on
Spotify.‚Äù The unfortunate issue with this single denouncement of the
industry‚Äôs current direction is that its source is adamantly guaranteed
a place for her work within Spotify‚Äôs top 10 percent for the rest of her
career‚Äôs lifetime (and probably far beyond.)

{empty}[I could now take the time to complain that she‚Äôs also entirely
abandoned the city https://youtu.be/iiMlq8frlqw[she owes for her
career‚Äôs creation] in its darkest hour, but let‚Äôs just plan on coming
back to the subject at a later date, when we‚Äôll be sure to touch on how
terribly Drake also treats Houston (and women.)]

Unsurprisingly, the apathy is far from mutual. From the Swedish
company‚Äôs perspective, the digits themselves should‚Äôve been dearly and
universally beloved from the beginning, and their exponentially
ballooning hubris became so inflated by 2014 that they
https://insights.spotify.com/us/about-spotify-insights/[launched a
WordPress blog] dedicated entirely to promoting and discussing their
data called https://insights.spotify.com/[_Spotify Insights_],
proclaiming themselves‚Äînaturally‚Äîto be ‚Äúthe world‚Äôs favorite streaming
service,‚Äù
https://insights.spotify.com/us/2017/11/02/listening-diversity-spotify/[championing]
the growing diversity in their demographics. Though Beyonc√© is mentioned
only twice upon a https://insights.spotify.com/us/?s=beyonce[search of
its archive] as it stands today, it‚Äôs with fanfare:
‚Äúhttps://insights.spotify.com/us/2015/03/06/10-female-artists-women-listen-to-the-most/[10
Female Artists Women Listen To The Most on Spotify]‚Äù declared her the
third most popular female artist among women, globally, and ‚ÄúSingle

interpreting its language correctly.)

<a href="http://pressurerecords.bandcamp.com/album/k-o">K.O. by Miss
Red</a>

We‚Äôve established that Spotify has comfortably planted itself at the
polar opposite end of the business spectrum from Bandcamp, yet for the
sake of an oblivious adjudicating layman‚Äôs understanding, you‚Äôd have
your work cut out for you explaining the difference between them: both
are online marketplaces with gigantic libraries of digital music which a
listener can browse, download locally, or stream from using Web browser
or the mobile applications offered by each, respectively‚Äîand they can do
from just about anywhere, for as much or as little as they wish. And‚Äîas
the music industry and its satellites shall always remain for the rest
of humanity‚Äôs reign‚Äîboth are overwhelmingly associated with young
people. There, the crucial divide should probably ring a bell‚Äîit‚Äôs been
a constant between cultural generations for as long as culture, itself
has existed.

There are those among us who‚Äôs adolescent adoration of music is still
completely valid as a very powerful component of hormonal development,
yet doomed to quickly sizzle into casual listening or worse by the time
our post-secondary Senior year rolls around. And then, there are those
on whom the curiosity clings devotedly on: the cool high school punk
band-forming types our culture loves to romanticize, who‚Äôll inevitably
end up bald and bespeckled with a pre-dawn community radio block. These
Musicians, Crate-Diggers, and capital-A Audiophiles have historically
overlapped in synonymous functions across a love triangle of dweebish
intolerability, though it‚Äôs become especially easy as of late to forget
that DIY recording is by no means a recent development‚Äîits financial and
technical barrier-to-entry has simply plummeted thanks to the
developmental progression of Digital Audio Workstations and a growing
industry of consumer-oriented audio equipment. For succinct insight into
this dynamic, let‚Äôs refer to the pre-dialogue context in
https://www.gq.com/story/jimmy-page-led-zeppelin-men-of-the-year-klosterman[Chuck
Klosterman‚Äôs _GQ_ interview] with ‚Äúthe second- or the third-best rock
guitarist of all time‚Äù‚Äî_Zinc Blimp_ legend Jumbo Page.

____
The only thing Page really wants to talk about [is] the sound of the
music, and how that sound was achieved. He can talk about microphone
placement for a very, very long time. Are you interested in having a
detailed conversation about how the glue used with magnetic audiotape
was altered in the late 1970s, subsequently leading to the
disintegration of countless master tapes? If so, locate Jimmy Page. If a
different musician obsessed over technological details with this level
of exacting specificity, he would likely be classified as a ‚Äúnerd,‚Äù as
that has become a strange kind of compliment in the Internet age. People
actually want to be seen as nerds. But that designation does not apply
here. Jimmy Page does not seem remotely nerdy.
____

Bandcamp‚Äôs core architecture was handbuilt from the beginning to handle
the ‚Äúhard part‚Äù for creators ‚Äúso that they didn‚Äôt have to be so nerdy,‚Äù
which it, alone pioneered on the Web, becoming the best metadata
management utility for all time, but also committing to a traditional
interpretation of music mediums that can feel old fashioned in 2018.
Despite having been around for a directly comparable length of time,
SoundCloud has maintained its relevance among friends in my network as
the more socially-focused platform for keeping up with work from their
peers thanks in large part to its exclusive, timestamp-oriented comment
function, which allows for ultra-specific shortform feedback between
fellow creators and fans. This is how the company has chosen to grow its
community, which has lent especially to its strength in the most ‚Äúnerdy‚Äù
independent scenes: hip-hop and electronic music. The experience is busy
by design and the divide between listener and creator is next to
non-existent‚Äîby now, the difference is universally irrelevant. External
sharing has also become a major strength since the inception of
SoundCloud‚Äôs Web audio player, which was unlike any other embeddable
we‚Äôd ever seen at the time. Over the years, it‚Äôs become the most
universally-supported means of embedding a track or playlist elsewhere,
though the space has quite recently began blooming with a few much
slimmer Open Web offshoots like Vocaroo, Clyp, and Instaudio.

While I can casually throw these names around for you in the same sized
font, the gulfs between the properties they denote are completely
inexpressible in words. Because Spotify went public in Q1 of this year,
they released
https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180502006667/en/[their first
earnings report] in April: 170 million active monthly users, $1.33
billion in total quarterly revenue, and $5.7-$6.2 billion in expected
total revenue for 2018. I‚Äôll spare you the entire Forbes piece it would
require to comprehensively demonstrate just how cavernous of a disparity
canyon the industry represents. Early projects like Pandora were docile,
ad-free, and sincerely curious about the curatorial potential of music
streaming services ‚Äì *let‚Äôs use this cool new tech to play *music* for
*anybody* with a Web browser if only because it‚Äôll be a blast* ‚Äì yet in
that sense, they‚Äôve all failed entirely. All except Bandcamp, anyway.

‚ÄúWe started as a service to help artists sell their music and
merchandise directly to their fans, but then as the site grew‚Äîit‚Äôs now
at about 12 million tracks and 1.5 million albums [as of 2014]‚Äîwe
evolved into also being a destination for music Discovery,‚Äù he explains,
partially anticipating the foot-to-the-floor transition to streaming
which has indeed shook the industry the hell up over the years since.
The company's solution is minimal, elemental, yet uniquely alternative
as only theirs could be: an idealized *digital interpretation of a music
collection*, which had actually launched a year before XOXO as part of
‚Äúhttps://daily.bandcamp.com/2013/01/10/bandcamp-for-fans/[Bandcamp for
Fans].‚Äù That release notably introduced the ability to ‚Äúfollow‚Äù both
artist and fan accounts, the now-iconic ‚Äúsupported-by‚Äù section on
release pages showing customers‚Äô avatars and optional comments, and
public wishlists. ‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs great to use a streaming service for
music Discovery‚Äîthey can be really really good for that,‚Äù Diamond
https://youtu.be/MaUkS-lr-ZM?t=16m11s[concedes], before reiterating one
of the several variations of Bandcamp‚Äôs founding premise that composes
his core argument: ‚Äúif you actually care about music, and you care about
the people who make it, and you want them to keep making it, the best
way to do that is to buy directly from them, or to use services that
allow you to directly support them.‚Äù

Instead of the ‚Äúfirehose‚Äù-like experience of a contemporary activity
feed, ‚Äúyou‚Äôve got a collection of albums and tracks that people were
passionate enough to spend money on.‚Äù For my personal use, Ethan lit up
a long-dormant incandescent bulb in my skull. My use of Bandcamp had
long been to purchase and download music files, only‚Äînever to stream
it‚Äîand there‚Äôs been good reason for this. While Bandcamp has formally
supported playback on iPhone and iPad in-browser since
https://daily.bandcamp.com/2010/07/14/now-streaming-on-the-ipad-iphone/[July
2010], actually using it for any substantial amount of playback has
always been a souring endeavor. Considering that it‚Äôs persisted _to this
day_, we must concede that it is part of an intentional design rather
than just an irritating flaw: *multitasking between apps or even browser
tabs will prevent continuous playback of an album*, as will locking the
device. In order to move from track to track fluidly, one must keep the
page with the in-use Bandcamp player front and center. For three years,
this was the only way to stream Bandcamp on mobile, but such capability
was far from reliably expected by even the earliest adopters, then‚Äî3G
data networks were worse than you remember, anyway‚Äîand then in 2013,
https://daily.bandcamp.com/2013/10/25/its-over/[the Bandcamp app was
launched] on iOS and Android, providing a sufficient fix in my book at
the time. (I‚Äôd rather any externally-embedded players I may engage with
in an album review or artist profile be limited to a single track,
anyway.) However, the app itself remained quite mediocre for years,
which was a tangible disappointment given how revolutionary their
desktop experience had been when the company launched,but not
necessarily a substantial deterrent to the sort of user they were
attracting.

I made a point to spend _a lot_ of time engaging with Bandcamp‚Äôs service
as much as possible ‚Äì naturally, this included a trip back through
http://bandcamp.com/davidblue[my neglected, digitally dusty Collection],
which proved a way more emotionally provocative experience than I
anticipated. Ethan‚Äôs simple truth didn‚Äôt really sink in until I realized
that this list is made up exclusively of my _real favorites_, and
there‚Äôs not a single track that is not inextricably and intoxicatingly
tied to a specific era(s) of my life (yes, even that one Blank Banshee
album... I was 18, okay?) It‚Äôs absurdly powerful‚Äînot something I could
engage with for any extended time without becoming saturated with
nostalgic gut stuff. (Listen for my upcoming special celebratory episode
of http://extratone.com/radio[Extratone Radio] to hear the best music
I‚Äôve found through Bandcamp.) It hadn‚Äôt occurred to me that I would
retain ownership and streaming rights to all music I‚Äôve
purchased‚Äîincluding for a $0.00 sum, as I did for at least half of the
works you see‚Äîeven after an artist chose to delete or hide it on their
own page. (Though they are not retained in my public collection, of
course.)

== The Discovery Debacle

Pursuing an objective definition of ‚Äúmusic Discovery‚Äù might appear
foolish ‚Äì an individual‚Äôs music taste is perhaps the most broadly
angst-steeped realms of overwhelming subjectivity in modern American
culture, after all ‚Äì but its the pungent poignancy of our fundamental
human relationship with sound, itself which makes the history of
Discovery‚Äôs digitization so important (and fascinating.) If I were to
ask you what you believe should be the single most important function
that must be reliably performed by any ‚Äúmusic Discovery‚Äù device ‚Äì
whether it be an application, Web service, magazine or even a
crate-digging habit ‚Äì the single factor which would render whole vague
concept inert, irrelevant, and/or completely destroyed, how would you
answer? How would you interpret the question?

It‚Äôs important we do well to take a considerable moment to cultivate a
special wariness of the eggshells beneath our feet in this arena.
Debatably at least a minim more than one‚Äôs taste in film, Americans from
Generation X on forward until the end of time (I suspect) will hold
‚Äútheir‚Äù music as perhaps the most integral support upon which their
identities are built throughout every stage of their lives. The intense
sensation of ownership that propels this phenomenon within our culture
leaves an especially sensitive passage ahead of us.

As a wide-eyed teenager and infantile audio producer, I explored the
idea of anti-music in my own entirely Bandcamp-supported project while I
searched ‚Äì aided tremendously by my expert best friend ‚Äì for the
edgiest, least sensical sounds and scenes on which to publicly attach on
my identity in an opposing of ‚ÄúDiscovery‚Äôs‚Äù extremes with fandom: *an
obsessive, entirely-detached last-ditch skirmish between the cultural
reality and my delusional pubescent need to be unique*. This process
appears to be a universal requisite in modern youth in one form or
another, but it‚Äôs important now that I emphasize this confession: I was
an especially ostentatious little backpacker fuck, but I‚Äôve continued to
find my shame well worth achieving a specific balance for music‚Äôs
purpose in my life, and I‚Äôd anecdotally endorse its potential to relieve
cognitive dissonance at great scale. There‚Äôs only so much fun to be had
blasting breakcore cassettes at deafening, distorted volumes solely to
bewilder rural overnight convenience store clerks on their smoke breaks
in the wee hours or the bruteforce seizure of the speakers‚Äô Bluetooth
connection at a frat party just to play harsh noise or anime-sampling
Hardstyle while demonically shrieking ‚Äì eyes rolled back ‚Äì and lighting
various parts of oneself ablaze before one realizes that 1) it‚Äôs they
who end up looking like the idiots for aggressively breaching a group‚Äôs
fun with inappropriate tunes (yes, no matter how interesting, rare, or
underrated they may be, Chadley;) 2) by ferally manifesting, you‚Äôve
deligitimized yourself, which 3) can seriously damage any future
attempts to accomplish *the fundamental drive to share the gospel of
music‚Äôs variety* out of your own rubish frustration with the differences
between you.

The real, sweetest truth is that *100% of all music has value potential*
because of the medium‚Äôs broad influence on the human psyche. Pop music
is amazing right now; the signature trap sound we devalued with Datpiff
jokes made us all look like fools when it unconsciously transcended our
‚Äúirony‚Äù and burrowed its own huge partition in our sincere hearts. After
my pitiful attempt to reject and distance myself from my own rural roots
by scoffing at country music for years, I‚Äôve made a beautiful peace with
the childhood memories and the historic excellence of Shania Twain and
The Dixie Chicks in their mastery of both wholesome joy and crippling
nostalgia (I‚Äôve even cried to Taylor Swift.) Yes, it‚Äôs been entirely
reasonable all along to enjoy the straightforwardly slothen pleasure in
belching ‚ÄúSweet Home Alabama‚Äù pounding cheap pissbeer on a foul pontoon
boat on the Lake of the Ozarks, leaving my penultimate irony to confess
that I‚Äôve only found true and serene identity through music after
learning how to stop insisting so violently upon the worldly,
one-of-a-kind superiority of my ‚Äútaste.‚Äù

That said, it‚Äôs still bewildering how content we are to abruptly abandon
the substance music had to our teenage selves out of misconstrued
justifications for our classic fain√©ance ‚Äì actively choosing to subject
our public ambiance to thousands of replays of ‚Äúthe best‚Äù records in
favor of dipping even the most cowardly toe into unfamiliar waters, even
when the opportunity cost is inherently halved ‚Äì only to then have the
audacity to evangelize our dilapidated conceptions of ‚Äúgood music‚Äù to
our children as we demonize the music of their generation, depriving
them of a very essential rite of their cognitive development. *I can
think of little more reductive, repugnant, reckless, or racist crusades
as a model figure than indoctrinating your child with an inherent
distaste for their own culture*, and nothing more deeply alarming to
hear from the mouth of someone born in the 21st century than shit like
‚ÄúQueen was better than any rapper will ever be,‚Äù or ‚Äúreal musicianship
will die forever with Eric Clapton.‚Äù It‚Äôs unfair and unnatural: imagine
if your high school classmates had consistently turned up their
scrunched nose at the living whole of rock & roll, declaring Scott
Joplin to be the last musician they could stand.

Consider if the industry-wide customer experience standard for the
musical ambiance in 1970s American eating and drinking establishments
was entirely comprised of works by John Phillip Souza, and the most
prevalent cultural revolution manifested itself something like the
following: In countless popular films set in the time (and the stories
told today by your parents of their youths that informs them,) a group
of popular high school boys ‚Äì generally three longtime childhood friends
and a single addition from the previous summer with an Army Dad and a
moderate bad boy aura that‚Äôs made him one of the school‚Äôs notoriously
attractive students and the somewhat-abusive leader in the pack. After
spending some time trying to convince the other three (the crucial
moment for his case being the bad kid‚Äôs rare moment of sincerity trope)
of its guaranteed social, sexual and financial ROI, they seal their
agreement to start a band with a four-way saliva slap. Imagine if in the
progression of this exhausted old tale, it remained entirely classic
(and boring) when it faded to a ‚ÄúTHREE MONTHS LATER...‚Äù ceiling shot of
the four the in full, gleaming, performance-spec get-up of the
presidential marching band in their garage, and it was revealed that
they‚Äôd they practiced ‚ÄúThe Star Spangled Banner‚Äù every night just to
make the girls swoon in the film‚Äôs resolution with an encore of ‚ÄúAmerica
the Beautiful‚Äù at an unsanctioned (and very patriotic!) house party.

Suffice it to say that it‚Äôs absolutely fucking bonkers how often I
encounter ‚ÄúSweet Home Alabama‚Äù (and other tunes I‚Äôve already heard
hundreds of times throughout the first third of my existence,
conservatively) dripping down from the overhead speakers in all manner
of big retail stores, where it‚Äôs inappropriate and unwelcome. Even from
the generous assumption that every single one of them is an objective
masterwork of composition, the amount of affection the American music
listening audience has for the same 500 singles is on par with our
rampant gun violence in terms of our unanimous tolerance for
ridiculously illogical habits. I‚Äôve been sitting in a cute, moderately
trendy coffee shop on the corner of the major avenue of access to my
cute, moderately trendy Portland neighborhood for an hour now, and I‚Äôve
recognized every single one of the tracks played just a bit too loudly
on the stereo. I‚Äôve been sick of them all since Middle School. That one
Bow Bow Chicka Chicka thing‚Ä¶ How very charming.

‚Äú_The 70s, the 80s‚Ä¶ the one-hit wonder channel!‚Äù_

Contrary to the popular hipster narrative we‚Äôve just defeated, it‚Äôs not
the popularity of the lineup that makes these experiences so
distasteful, but their _regularity_. It doesn‚Äôt take a doctor of
psychology to observe that tireless exposure to any given work of art
inevitably erodes its value, yet we continue to expend resources
saturating most mundane spaces in our society with an unyielding
regurgitation of the same brackish pop culture symbols as if we‚Äôre
_trying_ to either induce a canonical vomit, intentionally obliterate
the Yelp! reviews for a distant future museum‚Äôs ‚ÄúNorth America Enters
the 21st Century‚Äù exhibit, or _both_. After failing my best attempts to
elaborate with historical analogy citing a past event, I‚Äôm afraid we
must pivot to a science fiction-esque nanonarrative containing
obnoxiously speculative hypotheticals, instead.

*Imagine*: It‚Äôs 2036 ‚Äì four years after we found out we are not alone in
the universe when a significantly more advanced civilization makes
formal first contact with humanity by sending a party of diplomats,
anthropologists, and explorers (who were actually getting ready to go in
2016 before getting word of the Trump presidency and deciding we weren‚Äôt
quite ready just yet) who land their space egg right in front of the
United Nations‚Äô New York City headquarters and expressing something to
the tune of _hey so um‚Ä¶ we noticed you guys moved in and we just wanted
to stop by and say hi_, entirely altering humanity‚Äôs self-perception and
future trajectory (see: works by Gene Roddenberry) yadda yadda. The
visitors expressed a wish to begin a cultural exchange project with us,
and it‚Äôs just now coming to fruition‚Ä¶ I have only moments ago made
history in the eyes of the entire world when I walked through the front
door of a Target store in suburban New Jersey leading a hovering
hyper-intelligent silicon-based sphere of agender mist (roughly
comparative to a basketball in size,) who‚Äôs already both impressing and
shaming me tremendously as we move by the in-store Starbucks. From above
us, Semisonic‚Äôs ‚ÄúClosing Time‚Äù is belched upon my life‚Äôs proudest moment
and my guest requests we pause to discuss it, to my profound horror.

‚ÄúThe sound from the reproduction devices embedded above us...‚Äù the
android translator trails off for a moment. ‚ÄúIt is the same noise that
was distantly reproduced 51 hours ago in ‚ÄòMiami‚Äô as I conversed with
Ambassador Phillip Defranco about ‚Äòthe setting sun‚Äô on the ‚Äòbeach,‚Äô
coming from a small open air structure which he defined as ‚Äòa surf
shop,‚Äô which was occupied by a young male who appeared to be moderately
agitated, moving about in jagged strides as he wildly smacked the
foundational surface with ‚Äòa broom.‚Äô The Ambassador explained the youth
was likely nearing the end of his allotted period of daily occupational
labor.‚Äù

Blood is flooding my cheeks as I listen with a building dread to the
robot‚Äôs interpretation, awash with all manner of embarrassment for my
species.

‚ÄúIs the purpose of this noise reproduction of a logistical nature, or is
it perhaps a common ritual within business and/or working class
culture?‚Äù

<a href="http://ripswirl.bandcamp.com/album/possessed">Possessed by RIP
Swirl</a>

Now, it‚Äôs your turn to be the human representative in this pico science
fiction: you‚Äôre now obligated to confirm the alien anthropologist‚Äôs
hypothesis and explain that ‚ÄúClosing Time‚Äù is but one piece of recorded
music among billions of diverse expressive works across millennia. You
must reverently describe how the ‚Äúuniversal language‚Äù of math within
melodious composition has long been a hefty buzzword in the pop culture
conversations about interstellar communication and our longtime search
for extraterrestrial intelligence from the future-thrilled
90s‚ÄîS.E.T.I.‚Äôs glory days ‚Äì when we felt pretty damned good about space.
The historic launch of the United Nations‚Äô ‚Äúgreetings on behalf of the
people of our planet‚Äù etched into
https://www.npr.org/2017/09/30/554489944/the-voyager-golden-record-finally-finds-an-earthly-audience[The
Golden Record] aboard _Voyager I_ and Jodie Foster‚Äôs novel portrayal of
a S.E.T.I. scientist in the iconic Carl Sagan-sourced 1997 science
fiction drama _Contact_ are among the globally-celebrated Best Hits of
humanism (not to mention the organization listed on your paystubs,) and
they weigh a billion tons on you, now‚Äîin the most significant moment of
your entire life, bar none ‚Äì as you explain on behalf of your species to
*real* extraterrestrial intelligence the reality of how negligent it is
actually is of the culture the Record claimed to treasure. The worst
part, though? The entire experience is accompanied by a nasal-as-hell
Semisonic soundtrack.

Aren‚Äôt you _frustrated_? You should be, but it‚Äôs not over yet:
inevitably, your round fictional companion of note is going to follow up
their query with some seriously burning meat.

‚ÄúJust a half-generation ago, your utopian dream of a globally-connected
world ‚Äì in which everyone would be empowered to saturate and culture
themselves with new ideas and forms of expression ‚Äì was the defining
aspiration of your society, and yet you‚Äôve definitively achieved Total
Connectivity, now, and caused the overwhelmingly opposite result: you‚Äôre
all intolerable shitheads who every passing solar orbit become less and
less capable of anything but regurgitation of the same foul bullshit.
Y‚Äôall fucking wack. I‚Äôm out. ‚Äù

And there, that filthy little ball would have us all. Friends,
colleagues, human siblings of mine, *it‚Äôs long-past time we expect
better from ourselves* as music citizens of the world. Even the longest
living of us are endowed with very little opportunity to absorb anything
more than an infinitesimal fraction of all there is to experience, and
we‚Äôve all been carelessly and embarrassingly chucking it to the weeds.
If it this all seems excessive, there‚Äôs no need to feel attacked, but
for Pete‚Äôs sake‚Ä¶ please stop claiming you ‚Äúlike music‚Äù because it‚Äôs
misleadingly inaccurate and I‚Äôll promise never to use the phrase ‚Äúmusic
citizens of the world‚Äù again, in exchange.

[[section0050.xhtml#distribution-curation]]
== Distribution & Curation

*You, your friends, and I are missing out on way too much cool shit* and
we‚Äôre going to continue addressing possible causes and solutions to this
ongoing catastrophe without asking for a single moved finger on your
part because we are fucking saints. Let‚Äôs come back to ground and
consider a casual real-world use case for a streaming service which I‚Äôve
observed.

_It‚Äôs just after 1PM on an especially beautiful Summer day in 2018, and
you‚Äôve decided with your two best friends that an impromptu hot dog
barbecue in your little apartment‚Äôs parking lot would be a great way to
spend the afternoon. You get on Facebook Messenger ‚Äì no time to bother
with the formality of creating an event ‚Äì and begin to bother your group
of art school friends. In a few hours, you‚Äôve set up chairs in a circle
around the borrowed fire pit, gathered meat tubes, marshmallows, and
beer, and your guests have begun to arrive. The next step: retrieve your
cordless Bluetooth speaker from inside to place it atop a log nearest
the scene, re-pair it with your smartphone, and ___?_

Let‚Äôs acknowledge that music has incredibly diverse purposes of value in
human life‚Äî_of course_ I realize this‚Äîand ultimately, nobody can dictate
those fulfilled for another individual by any given track, album,
artist, or genre across time and setting. Even splittercore-obsessed
serial killers and body modding cybergrind disciples are doomed:
inevitably, they will one day let their guard down and find themselves
singing along with ‚ÄúGoodbye Earl‚Äù on the radio way off key, smiling like
a doofus. Even if one hates humanity, they will eventually be forced to
acknowledge that The Dixie Chicks came very close to its penultimate
manifestation.

I understand that it‚Äôs not _always_ time for something new for everyone,
but you‚Äôre missing out on music‚Äôs most worthwhile function by far if you
never seek anything fresh, and‚Äîif you still find yourself unwilling to
bother, even‚Äîcarrying around even the slightest bit of anecdotal
knowledge about _what‚Äôs going on_ in music with you can be invaluably
culturing to your image when socializing with youths and alien
intelligences, alike. There is a spectrum of enthusiasm (or
pretentiousness, depending on one‚Äôs own subjectives) for music that is
far more culturally consequential than the practice of partaking and/or
patroning any other artform. Settle comfortably on any point ‚Äì extreme
or not ‚Äì and you‚Äôre at serious risk of being uncool. Nobody wants
Anthony Fantano showing up to their party, but if you live too long
confusing the Beach Boys with the Beatles ‚Äì as I have ‚Äì folks start to
behave as if there‚Äôs something wrong with you. If it helps, let‚Äôs
suppose this to be the _real_ reason behind my need to discuss Bandcamp
‚Äì perhaps its relative lack of aged or worshiped-at-scale work justifies
it all.

By this nature, its effort is designed to bracket the enthusiast as
wholly as possible, but the value most in need of its experience has
become its comparatively extravagant hospitality for the dabbler. The
‚Äúhttps://daily.bandcamp.com/2012/06/07/behold-the-glory-of-the-discoverinator/[Discoverinator]‚Äù
(I would‚Äôve voted for calling it ‚ÄúGenre-Fucker‚Äù) is simply _the_ most
ingenious tool available anywhere to filter music by genre, subgenre,
location, and medium. Or at least... It‚Äôs too gorgeous not to be. Thanks
to its recent visual redesign, I don‚Äôt even care if it‚Äôs useful‚Äîit‚Äôs
just a beautiful thing to play with on both the Web and the iOS app
(though I‚Äôd bet they were each crafted separately.)

Front and center on the homepage is the
http://daily.bandcamp.com/[Bandcamp Daily] ‚Äì a showcase of features,
lists, albums of the day, and artist interviews from various staff and
guest contributors which I‚Äôd most certainly judge befit of a standalone
publication ‚Äì and the https://bandcamp.com/?show=[_Bandcamp Weekly_] ‚Äì
an extraordinarily-produced podcast like no other with special mixes,
guest appearances, and commentary which the company‚Äôs
https://bandcamp.com/andrewjervis[Chief Curator Andrew Jervis] has been
honing http://bandcamp.com/?show=1[since 2013] over 289 episodes as of
http://bandcamp.com/?show=289[this morning]. Its player functions both
in-browser and on the iOS app unlike any I‚Äôve ever seen, with a list of
embedded tracks that pop out when they‚Äôre actually spinning on the show
so that you can engage further with them, if you wish. It‚Äôs difficult to
describe, but it feels visually like you‚Äôre listening to a playlist in
Bandcamp‚Äôs normal player, except tracks are intermixed and faded between
one another beneath the host‚Äôs commentary, so the audio itself must be
pre-rendered. Regardless, it‚Äôs nearly as extraordinary an achievement in
Web design as the program itself is in curatorial music broadcasting.
I‚Äôm no addict to the genre, but I have yet to Discover another similar
product which I can binge episode after episode for hours without
becoming bored or irritated as I can the _Bandcamp Weekly_‚Äôs.

To fill in the parking lot party blank with a single streaming solution
for the sake of our young, art school-attending, likely more
musically-literate than average summer barbecue guests‚Äîhow viable is
Bandcamp? Truthfully, it‚Äôs only slightly more suited now than it was in
its earliest infancy for obediently filling a space with ambiance. We
could ponder whether or not its design discourages absentminded playback
only consequently, or perhaps condescendingly from the high, white tower
of hipster elitism on which you‚Äôll occasionally hear it accused of
perching, but UX design is _the_ most ridiculous sphere within which to
intenspeculate in lieu of verification (gazing at you with the timeless
grace of a thousand moons, _Medium,_) so lets hold off to seek out an
interview with a Bandcamp representative.

SoundCloud would be a bit closer to the mark‚Äîit can be configured to
simply _keep going_ after you‚Äôve finished a track, regardless of where
you may be within the interface (excluding the embedded player, of
course)‚Äîbut it‚Äôd be much safer to spend the smidgen of extra time
required to find a manmade playlist. Letting it loose will quickly land
you on some seriously dubious (and probably embarrassing) nerd shit. As
I understand it, YouTube has long been the go-to houseparty music player
because of its universality, Chromecast support, and (obviously) visual
component for accompanying music videos, so its new, ad-free
https://djmag.com/content/youtube-launches-youtube-music-and-youtube-premium-streaming-services[YouTube
Music service] has a lot of potential, in theory, but we‚Äôre _outside_ in
this scenario and our smartphone is our only playback device.

Startlingly, the Web‚Äôs given best answer to this situation is still
Spotify in all of its culture-diluting gluttony. _Internet radio_?
Yikes. You can still find a gem of a stream every once in a while, but
they‚Äôre usually unreliable and probably abandoned, so the catalog won‚Äôt
last you more than a few hours before you‚Äôll start to hear repeats. You
could search out the internet stream of your favorite radio station‚Äîa
_student_ radio station, even‚Äîbut those offering the most entertaining
programming are unlikely to have a suitable playlist on a summer
afternoon. So‚Äîforgetting its overwhelming financial funneling toward its
top 10% and everything else for a moment‚Äîwhy not just give up the
pretense and use Spotify? Again, for most of my friends, it works just
fine to play Cat Stevens, Run DMC, Gorillaz or The Rolling Stones, but I
have yet to figure out a combination of keywords to keep it on target
within even the most rudimentary parameters. Such ill-restraint becomes
especially dire‚Äînecessary, really‚Äîwhen I queue up ‚ÄúCannibal Ox Radio‚Äù
for the office and R Kelly ends up playing, 20 minutes in. Using
personally-targeted artist bans is probably too subjective to ask of
such a service in the spotlight, but *how about an option to filter out
white rappers*? (I hope you didn‚Äôt blink because that‚Äôs by far my best
contribution in tech writing yet.)

The truth is, I‚Äôd probably end up calling upon Apple Music as I‚Äôve been
an on-and-off subscriber since its release, but have yet to meet a
single fellow user. The girth of its catalog is
https://9to5mac.com/2018/05/06/apple-music-vs-spotify/[reportedly still
nearly] https://9to5mac.com/2018/05/06/apple-music-vs-spotify/[25%
larger], its UI is significantly more cohesively integrated with iOS
(which hasn‚Äôt always been a given from Apple with its music software,
mind you,) yet it costs me precisely the same $9.99 a month as Spotify
Premium would. If I _did_ know somebody else who used it, they‚Äôd be able
to see http://bit.ly/dbapple[my public profile] including my playlists
and activity, just as my followers on Spotify can, and I can create
‚ÄúStations‚Äù for artists that function similarly to Spotify‚Äôs endless
adaptive playlists, but‚Äîcrucially, for myself‚Äîafter the app‚Äôs redesign
for iOS 10, the integration of Apple Music music with my own iTunes
library is completely seamless. With unlimited data, I‚Äôve selected the
option to refrain from storing music locally, which further diminishes
the distinction between ‚Äúmy‚Äù music and the music I‚Äôve paid for the
rights to stream. Fundamentally, the end result is that I pay ten bucks
a month for ‚Äúownership‚Äù of _all_ the music on iTunes proper.

While I might personally play _Bandcamp Weekly_ episodes in such a
context and gladly accept whatever results I‚Äôd get, I‚Äôd only do so
acknowledging the subsequently increased risk of some vest-wearing fuck
I‚Äôve never met springing out of the bushes to accost me about Weird
Allan. However, I am neither cool nor musically literate, which makes me
particularly vulnerable to misusing algorithmic Discovery‚Äîthe practice
in which artificial intelligence has become most widely-deployed which
continues to prove itself to better deserve the term ‚Äúautomated
wallowing,‚Äù or ‚Äúrobotized ear rot.‚Äù

Ironically, Damon Krukowski‚Äôs aforementioned ‚Äúresponsibility‚Äù essay on

____
The series shows Pitchfork editors (and favored musicians) gushing about
their love of streaming‚Äîthe immediacy! The deep back catalogs! One
editor says it helps him keep track of his listening habits, while
another rejoices at not having to dig through crates at record shops
anymore. Yet another likens Spotify to walking around a music festival,
discovering something new at every turn. What does it mean for ‚Äúthe most

own crate digging? What does it mean when the tastemaking humans endorse
data-driven machines? What does it mean when the algorithms become cool?

We love bespoke Open Web projects, so exploring _Inside Discovery_‚Äôs
(surely bespoke) experience induced the same pathetic sort of _I wish

become my default, bitchy mood, and blaming as a further let down to

Upon a brief review of these once-petty desires and the new, apocalyptic
solutions which we are burning barns full of cash to develop, it would
appear that the overwhelmingly defining feature of those which are at
all viable remains to be the interference of a human being, and why
wouldn‚Äôt it be, still, when manual music aggregation remains so
desperately cheap? I‚Äôd wager heavily that there‚Äôs at least a single
editor within Apple Music who‚Äôs spent serious time embedded in the
Berlin techno scene considering how regularly the prime ‚ÄúTechno‚Äù
playlist is updated with new work of a moderately-industrial bias.

‚ÄúThe downside to automated music Discovery is that we‚Äôre encouraged to
develop a taste profile and stick to it,‚Äù

The truth is, the stories that come to us that smell the strongest of
philanthropy on the surface are often actually about some dusty,
Y2K-lookin‚Äô-ass nerd with powerfully tedious grievances and too much
time on their hands. The whole world knows the details by now of how
Mark Zuckerberg‚Äôs horny social ineptitude led to Facebook‚Äôs conception,
but we must both keep in check the bad habit we share ‚Äì the whole
present-day reading world and I, that is ‚Äì of dwelling entirely too much
on the most ‚Äúnegative,‚Äù soul-agitating tales in what we perceive to be
the pursuit of necessary ingredients for concocting a better solution.
Bandcamp‚Äôs story is predominantly comprised of smart decisions, sincere
transparency, and savvy ideas which are best examined in contrast, I‚Äôm
afraid, with all that‚Äôs being done _wrong_ everywhere else.

____
Are my favorite punk bands now Bandcamp bands? Are they suddenly wanting
to conform to a kind of Bandcamp aesthetic? I don‚Äôt think so. Not yet.
But if that does happen, something might be lost ‚Äî a sense of these
bands defining themselves as they want to, which is sort of the Bandcamp
promise in the first place. People can use help navigating the riches of
Bandcamp. But its estimable editorial project opens an interesting
question: When does help turn into tastemaking?

== The Creators

You missed it, didn‚Äôt you‚Äîthe ten-year anniversary of Bandcamp‚Äôs launch?
Ashamed, I realized last month that I did, too. Ashamed, because I owe a
lot to to the platform‚Äôs unwavering commitment to the distribution and
curation of work made by just about all of my favorite artists‚Äîwithin
and outside of my social network. Throughout 2015, I hosted a number of
conversations with exceptional, future-looking creators on _Drycast_
which I am especially proud of. On one
https://anchor.fm/extratone/episodes/Juke-Master-Samantha-Carter-and-the-Producers-Extravaganza-e1neqc/a-a4674c[early
episode] with an exceptional total of _seven_ music makers, I observed
in a beat that ‚Äúall of us have Bandcamp accounts,‚Äù before the week‚Äôs
guest, Samantha Carter, suggested that she‚Äôd found her page especially
financially rewarding, and originated the concept of the ‚ÄúBandcamp Sugar
Daddy‚Äù (which I personally ship 100%.)

‚ÄúIt's something I take for granted,‚Äù said my friend
https://twitter.com/yzome[yzome] ‚Äì a https://yzome.bandcamp.com/[truly
one-of-a-kind electronic producer] who‚Äôs far-traveling composition is
probably the closest Digital Audio Workstation equivalent of Extreme Use
Testing‚Äîwhen automotive manufacturers effectively torture new prototypes
with the most inhospitable conditions on Earth until they break.
However, it‚Äôs not a PR stunt in yzome‚Äôs case‚Äîhe‚Äôs just very good at
doing what he does after doing it for nearly 10 years‚Äîand his end
product requires a hell of a lot more than any one genre would ever
presume, but it more than delivers back on the investment with
significant interest.

When
https://anchor.fm/extratone/episodes/Electronic-Producer-Yzome-and-his-Alien-Sound-e1lmcj/a-a41qc5[he
appeared on _Drycast_] in January 2015, we failed to achieve any
descriptors more sophisticated than ‚Äúalien sounds,‚Äù but perhaps that‚Äôs
all they need: the inner worlds into which yzome invites us are of
manic, unpredictable arrhythmia which poses an unapologetic, yet
magically lighthearted challenge to any cohesive theory. It‚Äôs very rare
that his proudly-ungenreable exploration of the fringes does not demand
the listener‚Äôs full attention, yet it always manages to be
_inoffensively aggressive_ like *nothing* else, which suggesting promise
for the possible upheaval of a long-upheld natural law among electronic
dance music: yzome doesn‚Äôt need to be a shithead to challenge the
listener intellectually.

<a href="http://yzome.bandcamp.com/album/yvette">YVETTE by yzome</a>

Play _https://yzome.bandcamp.com/album/yvette[YVETTE]_ for any boomer
you know with that classically impenetrable disgust for _all_ electronic
music, and you‚Äôll witness firsthand how special yzome‚Äôs particular
innovation truly is. No, they‚Äôre not going to be _sexually liberated_,
or anything‚Äîit‚Äôs still going to be alarming‚Äîbut you‚Äôll notice that the
swift and overwhelming fury which sample and break-heavy dance music has
always awoken within them has been miraculously circumvented. Instead of
immediately storming off, they‚Äôll be paralyzed in an existential fugue
state from which they may never quite fully emerge. I‚Äôve seen it
firsthand. It‚Äôs witchcraft.

There is no other across the (especially-wide) electronic spectrum who
can so loudly go so far, so fast without any insincerity, whatsoever.
His arrangement seems mischievous and all over the place, but really
listen and you‚Äôll hear rips of recognizable patterns playing peekaboo in
willy-nilly bursts that reveal his dynamic mastery of the dance music
space through Breakcore, Juke, Footwork, and Techno sampling. All of
this is to say, really, that yzome‚Äôs music represents a level of
boundary-pushing which only a niche audience tends to truly appreciate,
yet is undoubtedly worthy of an elegantly-presented host like Bandcamp.

‚ÄúLike thank god I don't have to look for a label to release this. It's
seen as a legitimate platform (by people who might actually care about
what I‚Äôm doing, at least,) which I think is less offputting than
uploading things to Mediafire or whatever else. It‚Äôs populist and
boutique at the same time.‚Äù

*_Populist, yet boutique_*. Can we really be expected to exceed this
summation? Well, nobody‚Äôs said much at all in the mainstream press, but
what _has_ been said is 1) unusually misplaced in the spaces of those
least likely to find it relevant and 2) _way_ more insightful than you‚Äôd
expect.

‚ÄúBandcamp has an independent-artist identity because of practicalities:
Independent artists from Web-centered subcultures need it most,‚Äù
observed an especially savvy online aside from by
http://benratliff.net/[Ben Ratliff]‚Äîjazz and pop critic for __The New
York Times‚Äî__asking
‚Äúhttps://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/20/arts/music/bandcamp-shopping-for-music.html[Is
Bandcamp the Holy Grail of Online Record Stores]?‚Äù So why aren‚Äôt we
talking about it? The other important takeaway: founder Ethan Diamond
told Ratliff that ‚Äúthe company has never spent money on promotion.‚Äù This
is largely why I‚Äôve invested so much time and affection into this
piece‚Äîgratitude is not often sellable incentive for mainstream coverage.

The truth is, the continued obscurity of Bandcamp‚Äôs story despite all
it‚Äôs done comes down not to any malpractice by the company (in fact, it
would likely be more visible had it fucked up more,) or even to its
prevalence in the careers of big industry names (whom I will address in
detail shortly,) but because it simply operates too magnanimously for
its customers to be taken seriously as a newsworthy business, which is
problematic and personally infuriating. In November, 2015, Bandcamp made
mention in _The New Yorker_ via the openly diminutive context of _Car
Seat Headrest‚Äôs_
https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/02/growth-spurt-pop-music-hua-hsu[origin
story], describing it as ‚Äúa charming alternative,‚Äù and ‚Äúa casual,
low-risk approach.‚Äù Granted, it‚Äôs worth noting that the platform did not
address its lack of ‚Äúeditorial guidance‚Äù until a year later, with the
https://daily.bandcamp.com/2016/06/13/welcome-to-bandcamp-daily/[launch]
of the excellent _Bandcamp Daily_ blog, but I think you‚Äôll agree it‚Äôs in
poor taste to argue against the legitimacy of a _music_ distribution
platform because it‚Äôs _too democratic._ Perhaps it‚Äôs still just beyond
reasonable expectations to get a top-of-the-foodchain music writer‚Äôs
head wrapped around the idea that such products on The Internet can
easily‚Äîeven optimally‚Äîservice both hobbyists and professionals.

Last year, Bandcamp was responsible for

million in payments] to artists like Jlin,the genius commonly associated

underrepresented movement,) for pushing its expressive boundaries both
in theory and geography further than any other, and who‚Äôs so far

Cntrl-Fing for ‚ÄúBandcamp‚Äù will yield 0 results from her interviews with

Independent_, _Rolling Stone_, _SPIN_, _No Fear of Pop_, _self-titled

_Mixmag_, or _melting bot_, and only one in _Interview Magazine_. To be
clear: I am *not* arguing that Jlin‚Äîa black female music artist‚Äîshould
be profusely thanking Bandcamp‚Äîa service founded largely by white male
programmers‚Äîfor hosting her most visible page but rather that the more
independent of these publications, especially, should mention its role
in her story or‚Äîat the very least‚Äîbe hyperlinking to
https://jlin.bandcamp.com/[her Bandcamp page] first, for both her‚Äôs and
their readers‚Äô sake‚ÄîBandcamp‚Äôs cut of album purchases is half of iTunes.
From the user experience perspective, it‚Äôs absurd that those of these
pages including embedded music players chose to use SoundCloud‚Äôs‚Äîwhich
is more resource heavy (yet of noticeably lesser streaming playback
quality) and visually disruptive‚Äîinstead of
https://daily.bandcamp.com/2013/06/12/all-new-players-up-twitter-too/[Bandcamp‚Äôs].

The two services were launched the same year‚Äîthat fateful 2008‚Äîbut
comparing them is complicated. They are clear opposites in at least one
principal: how they‚Äôve defined their mission. Bandcamp has changed less
throughout its history than any other Web service that comes to mind
(see below,) but SoundCloud has struggled with identity issues, to their
vastly-superior success (in terms of user statistics, anyway.) _The New
York Times_
https://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/06/15/soundcloud-an-audio-sharing-site-hits-5-million-users/[reported
in June, 2011] that they‚Äôd reached 5 million users, citing their
decision to expand focus beyond ‚Äúpopular music‚Äù to explain the
milestone. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre building a sound platform that‚Äôs not just about
music,‚Äù said Alex Ljung ‚Äì a SoundCloud co-founder and the company‚Äôs
chief executive at the time ‚Äì and its present landscape certainly
reflects a diverse offering of uses, but ultimately, any . Today, both
SoundCloud and Bandcamp have premium subscription plans for artists
which are at least _perceived_ to be competitive with one
another‚Äîhttps://blog.soundcloud.com/2013/03/11/introducing-soundcloud-pro/[SoundCloud
Pro] and https://daily.bandcamp.com/2012/06/25/new-features-up/[Bandcamp
Pro], respectively‚Äîalong with free base experiences, which we‚Äôll compare
first.

*Free Bandcamp Account Uploads*: quantity unlimited, size of each file
limited to 291mb. *Distribution*: unlimited streaming, up to 200 free
downloads per month.

*Free SoundCloud Account Uploads*: total of 3 hours uploaded at any
given time. *Distribution*: unlimited streaming, unlimited downloads.

Both offer access ‚Äúbasic‚Äù statistics for their tracks at this tier which
most of the creators I know consider more than enough‚Äîthe usefulness of
any playback/download stats is negligible when you‚Äôre publishing within
tight niches‚Äîand each has had about 5 years to fine-tune their free
offerings so that they feel as complete as possible. If you‚Äôre planning
on publishing a podcast on SoundCloud, you‚Äôre obviously going to have to
upgrade your upload limit even beyond Pro ($8/month, 6-hour upload
limit) to Pro Unlimited ($16/month, unlimited uploads,) though I would
suggest a plethora of alternative methods before you got that far.
Unfortunately, they would not include a free Bandcamp account. While
https://bandcamp.com/?f=all&g=podcasts&gn=0&p=0&s=top&w=0#discover[there]
_are_
https://bandcamp.com/?f=all&g=podcasts&gn=0&p=0&s=top&w=0#discover[podcasts
on Bandcamp], they‚Äôre completely separate the platform‚Äôs aspirations and
without support for the basic requirements of podcast distribution
(namely, RSS feeds.)

Bandcamp‚Äôs Pro option is $10 a month and includes a custom domain, batch
file uploading, private streaming (for press and/or fans) plus the
ability to disable _free_ streaming (requiring listeners to actually buy
the music to enable any playback,) ad-free video hosting (which nobody
uses, to my knowledge,) extended fan interaction tools, and a broader
statistics suite that includes Google Analytics support. SoundCloud‚Äôs
Pro and Pro Unlimited options are complimentary, but a full-time
independent artist could justify maintaining Pro accounts on both
services or neither‚Äîone does not necessarily replace the other, but the
contrast in their chosen presentations has led to a divide in the
cultures of the two communities so stark
http://www.thefader.com/2017/04/03/bandcamp-artists-vs-soundcloud-artists-meme[it
could be a punchline] and/or simplified to say that _SoundCloud is for
rap_ and _Bandcamp is not_.

It‚Äôs not entirely shocking, then, that SoundCloud‚Äôs story has been more
present in the greater conversation than Bandcamp‚Äôs. Frankly, its
largest issues are directly related: compared to SoundCloud, *Bandcamp‚Äôs
community is White As Fuck* (a claim I can only make on behalf of my own
observations and those which a select few creators have seen fit to
express to me over the years, considering that the company has yet to
release any demographic information about its creators) which is a
glaringly fundamental obstruction to the project‚Äôs broader mission to
help music culture ‚Äúhttps://bandcamp.com/about[thrive].‚Äù

From a future historian‚Äôs perspective, the battle for the definitive
name in independent digital music distribution has already won, largely
thanks to its relationship with Chance The Rapper, who‚Äôs quickly become
a ‚Äúcultural influencer, thought leader, global star,‚Äù and one of my
generation‚Äôs upmost celebrity champions. Obviously, there is little
sense trying to determine whether SoundCloud _earned_ his partnership or
landed their popular association with his name as long as the artist
maintains it publicly, while continuing to
https://soundcloud.com/pitchfork/pitchfork-presents-in-sight-out-chance-the-rapper[give
new meaning] to the phrase ‚Äúserially likable.‚Äù Thus far, his mythical
power to exude purity has felt virtually 100% airtight Last year, his
second album _Coloring Book_ made history when it won the

https://www.engadget.com/2017/02/12/chance-the-rapper-first-streaming-only-grammy/[Grammy
for Best Album]. In my personal favorite moment in recent popular
culture memory, the fashionable-as-hell young man
https://youtu.be/FkAJ_BU66Zs[accepted the accolade] by looking the whole
industry establishment in the face and proclaiming ‚Äúthis is for every
indie artist‚Äîeverybody who‚Äôs been doin‚Äô this mixtape shhhh..._tuff_ for
a long ass time... shouts out to every independent artist out there;
https://www.theverge.com/2017/2/12/14594672/chance-the-rapper-grammy-awards-2017-soundcloud[shouts
out to SoundCloud for holding me down].‚Äù Obviously, such significant,
sentimental, and sincere sentiments are _never_ expressed about tech
companies by beloved darlings of the art world like Chance‚Äîespecially
not for Earth-encompassing awards show audiences.

After
https://www.theverge.com/2017/7/6/15928674/soundcloud-cuts-40-percent-staff[last
year‚Äôs massive layoff], it was
https://twitter.com/chancetherapper/status/885921220759355397[Chance‚Äôs
assurances] that ‚ÄúSoundCloud is here to stay‚Äù which the public took to
heart. Even if the company _is_ destined to fail within the next year
(it appears to be as yet missing much of a verdict,) and it‚Äôs all still
destined to fold at any moment, at least it‚Äôll have the distinct pride
of doing so having maintained his publicly-expressed respect and
confidence, which is a damned fine legacy in my book. Meanwhile,
Bandcamp has only made a few small tweaks to its basic infrastructure,
and added new features very deliberately, which haven‚Äôt resulted in a
single memorable controversy. Aside from
https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2010/07/amanda-palmer-sells-15k-on-bandcampin-three-minute.html[Amanda
Palmer], perhaps, there has never been a single band or artist who‚Äôve
been known as ‚Äúfrom Bandcamp,‚Äù leaving our only pitch to be something
like _Independent Online Music Platform on Track to Complete 10th Year
Serving Small-Time Artists, Continues to Look Pretty Good_.

Considering the significance of these contributions, it‚Äôs of a special
wonder that they were made not by a non-profit organization, academic
movement, or government endowment, but by a for-profit, California-based
tech company that‚Äôs continued to thrive and innovate great content,
entirely apart from mainstream coverage.

== The Future

It might seem a bit much on the surface, but in many ways, Bandcamp has
spent the past 10 years showing us what a for-profit, Web-based,
culturally-edging independent platform Can be, even in the Valley.

Though Bandcamp has embarked upon unusually sparse explanation of its
editorial directive in the _Daily_ blog and _Weekly_ podcast, but
regularly consume either for any length of time, and you‚Äôll notice a
particular savvy for Discovering technically-progressive Afrocentric
projects:
‚Äúhttps://daily.bandcamp.com/2016/08/05/a-guide-to-black-experimental-music/[Black
Experimental Music].‚Äù

On
https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/19/podcasts/still-processing-tin-house-inclusion-hannah-gadsby.html[last
week‚Äôs episode] of the excellent _New York Times_ podcast _Still
Processing_, co-host Jena Wortham ‚ÄúI‚Äôm thinking a lot about ways in
which new culture, new cultural products, new cultural creators come to
light in ways that sidestep these traditional means and don‚Äôt have to go
through the traditionally very white, very male, very cis, very hetero
hoops to prove worthiness.‚Äù

So, our greatest hope for the decentralization of the music industry in
the 1990s ended up transforming before us to become the most effectively
divisive Discovery barrier ever known to man because of its
psychological influence sub-threshold at unprecedented scale over time,
in parallel with so many other like horrific monstrosities we‚Äôve
discovered in anguish to be mutants of those final salvations from our
atrocious history which we‚Äôd been so relieved to believe in. Surely, the
turn of the millennia was destined to be our final turning point ‚Äì the
moment we‚Äôd finally use our new technology to discover a truth (or maybe
just a really good clue,) that‚Äôd immediately unite our species in a
deafening, worldwide aha moment when it would reveal a general abstract
of whatever the fuck our deal was that was preventing our silent,
dutiful, and 100% harmonious collective effort toward a utopia like
_Star Trek: The Next Generation_‚Äôs, in which anyone is absolutely free
of obligation or desperation from birth to pursue‚Ä¶ whatever with their
time.

=== Setting out upon a desperate personal journey to rediscover enchantment with computers.

This evening, a pack¬≠age is sched¬≠uled to arrive upon my doorstep

ful¬≠ly intend to savor, doc¬≠u¬≠ment, and pre¬≠serve every pos¬≠si¬≠ble

2000]__I stumbled across this wonderful help document in
https://winworldpc.com/product/lotus-smartsuite/9-8[Lotus SmartSuite
9.8] and my head just shot right off.__

All of the programs in this release of Lotus SmartSuite meet Lotus
guidelines for Year 2000 (Y2K) readiness. When used in accordance with
its associated documentation, each of the SmartSuite programs is capable
of correctly processing, providing and/or receiving date data within and
between the 20th and 21st centuries, provided that all products (for
example, hardware, software and firmware) used with the program properly
exchange accurate date data with it.

*A little background information* +
In the past, you have probably entered a 2-digit number to represent the
year in a date with the assumption that the year would fall between 1900
and 1999. For example, 4/10/02 was in 1902 and 5/8/47 was in 1947.

With the change to the year 2000, you should be aware that computer
programs may now interpret dates you enter with 2-digit years to be in
the 20th or the 21st century depending on the method the program uses to
define a 2-digit year.

SmartSuite programs use a sliding (rolling) window method to determine
the year when you enter only 2 digits to represent the year in a date.

*Notes*

* You can enter the year as 4 digits to make sure you get the results
you want. For example, enter 1916 or 2016 instead of 16 for the year.
* Although you can change how a program displays a date by selecting
different date formats, the program stores a constant value for the date
no matter how you choose to display it.

*What is the sliding window method?* +
In SmartSuite, the sliding window method defines a window of 100 years
around the current year (determined by the system date on your
computer). When you enter a 2-digit year, the program compares the 2
digits you entered with the years that fall within this 100 year
window. +
For example, entering 25 for the year might be interpreted as 1925 but
04 might mean the year 2004.

The years that mark the beginning and end of this window are defined by
where the program splits the window with the current year. +
By default, 1-2-3, Approach, Freelance Graphics, Organizer, and Word Pro
use an 80/20 rule for this sliding window ‚Äî the window begins 80 years
before and ends 19 years after the current year.

*How does the 80/20 rule work?* +
Suppose the current year is 1999. Using the 80/20 rule, a window
spanning 100 years includes the years 1919 to 2018.

In 1999, any 2-digit year you enter from 19 to 99 will equal years from
1919 to 1999. Any 2-digit year you enter from 00 to 18 will equal years
from 2000 to 2018. If you want to enter a date before 1919 or after
2018, you must enter 4 digits for the year. +
For example, assume that the current year is 1999. ‚Ä¢ If you enter
4/2/19, the year will be 1919. ‚Ä¢ If you enter 4/2/72, the year will be
1972. ‚Ä¢ If you enter 4/2/00, the year will be 2000. ‚Ä¢ If you enter
4/2/17, the year will be 2017. ‚Ä¢ If you enter 4/2/1917, the year will be
1917. Every year this 100 year window moves (slides) forward one year.
Under the 80/20 rule, when the year changes to 2000, the window will
include the years 1920 to 2019. When the year changes to 2001, the
window will include the years 1921 to 2020, and so on.

*How do you change the 80/20 default?* +
The 80/20 default for SmartSuite is set through a single entry in the
Windows registry. You can change this registry entry using the sample
scripts available on the Web (www.lotus.com/smartsuitedev) and in the
\Extra directory on the CD version of Lotus SmartSuite. +
*Caution* Changing the default changes it for all of the programs in
SmartSuite.

*How do SmartSuite programs store dates?* +
All the SmartSuite programs store date values with the fully qualified
year. Therefore, dates already stored in files are not affected by the
sliding window. The sliding window is used to interpret a date when you
enter it using 2 digits to represent the year. +
*Caution* If years are stored as separate values in a file, and scripts
or macros interpret these dates as they run, the sliding window rules
will apply to those values when only 2 digits are stored for the year.

*For 1-2-3 users only* +
You can turn off the 80/20 sliding window in 1-2-3 by changing the date
settings in the 1-2-3 Preferences dialog box. You can also display all
dates with 4-digit years. For more information on 1-2-3 and the year
2000, open Help in 1-2-3 and search on Year 2000 in the Help Index.

If you've ever found this industry's history intriguing, you've likely
heard Brian McCullough's superb _Internet History Podcast_¬†before, and
it's obvious to you how invaluable
http://www.internethistorypodcast.com/2014/05/the-incredible-true-story-behind-amcs-halt-and-catch-fire-how-compaq-cloned-ibm-and-created-an-empire/[an
interview episode with Compaq's Biggest Boy] would be for a head start
on digesting the story. In accordance with¬†_Halt and Catch Fire_'s pilot
release in 2014, the broad-shouldered soldier of open computing appeared
to have been on a mini media tour (even though he openly admitted he‚Äôd
yet to actually watch it.) [His last remark ‚Äì ‚Äúmaybe even as exciting as
the real thing‚Äù ‚Äì may sound like silly Dork Rod conjecture, but the show
wasn‚Äôt nearly as engaging because they had(?) to remove the
_compatibility_ component, which is the meat of the whole thing.]
McCullough is usually ace at this stuff, but he sounds a bit shaky in
this one, though nobody should blame him ‚Äì I certainly would be, too.
Rod Canion's accent (BIOS=__buy-OSS__) and general intensity must make
for¬†one hell of a presence, even over the phone. 2014 was a long time
ago.

McCullough's own summary of the conversation is so thorough (he was
writing a book,) there's only a single possible addition.

____
‚ÄúThere's a certain risktaking gene that runs through a lot of Texans.‚Äù

There‚Äôs no other way to say it: *I believe in Texas*. Specifically,
Houston. DJ Screw, UGK, Z-Ro, Trae, Fat Pat, etc.‚Äì these I adopted as
religion, years ago. From my perspective, Rod Canion‚Äôs ballsy, loyal
Houstonianism hustle makes perfect sense. Yes, I‚Äôm afraid you‚Äôve
basically stumbled into my passionate cause to unite two Houston icons.

_Opera's no-connection mascot is the cutest branding on any current web
browser. Fight me._

Yesterday, I finished moving out of the situation I‚Äôd been living in for
~6 weeks in the basement of a southeast Portland home near the western
base of Mt. Tabor. You'd see it just across from the flat Washington
Mall-ish grass rectangle that provides daring suburban explorers their
most worthwhile reward for reaching the top. It resembles one of many
local residential templates which I was completely unequipped to
understand when I arrived in the area last year. You'll never observe
any of its inhabitants outside doing any of the things people do when
they are unaware of ‚Äì or unconcerned with being observed. Walking by an
afternoon front yard ‚Äúfamily gathering‚Äù (young white parents and their
one or two children) is a prospect of haste. Introducing new movement to
the vicinity after the sun has gone down stirs a disruption from deep
within its energy. Everyone in this town is afraid. I say it‚Äôs an
unnatural way to live, but I‚Äôm just a fucking bumpkin.

As you may or may not have observed, the vast majority of my working
being lives on the World Wide Web, which requires, fundamentally‚Ä¶. An
internet connection. In most any other present-day first world
circumstance, these are infinitely available, but I discovered ‚Äì after
the moving process was entirely completed, of course ‚Äì that my tenants
did *not* actually have an in-house connection of their own. They
explained to me that their neighbor ‚Äì an ‚ÄúIT professional‚Äù for IBM ‚Äì had
offered to let them use _his_ WiFi network, and they‚Äôd found the
arrangement sufficient. However, because IBM is _The_ archaic marque of
digital fascism (disclosure: they are also my
http://bilge.world/compaq[sworn blood enemy],) it wasn‚Äôt altogether a
surprise when they told me that his offer did not extend to ‚Äúguests.‚Äù

I considered that a defined period of WiFi fasting at home could make
for an interesting experiment ‚Äì perhaps even a needed mental reset ‚Äì and
I couldn't reasonably afford to acquire my own dedicated 4G hotspot,
anyway. The reality became a relentless paranoid battle for any trickle
of access ‚Äì sometimes for _a dozen bytes per second_; for just the most
basic digital communications like SMS and email ‚Äì which led to more
superstitious hypotheses about precarious antenna orientation, progress
bar hallucinations, out-of-control frustration, and hopeless fixation
with refresh commands than I remember from 2nd generation cell networks
in the Midwest, 10 years ago, or even domestic dial-up, and truly
revealed the extent to which I'd taken connectivity for granted.

My observations of my own behavior throughout this drought are worth
more than their mild amusement: even this petty disparity (I was never
more than two or three yards from nearly-whole signal at the top of the
outside stairs) re-sensitized my perspective to the abstract concept of
network unreliability which I'd been entirely spared since
prepubescence. Though 4 billion human beings now regularly interact with
the World Wide Web, their connections span a mathematically gargantuan
spectrum of speed and reliability. In urbanizing myself as an adult, I
have unconsciously latched on to the entitled ideal that internet access
is a public service and accepted dramatically-increasing dependence on
services that engorge greater and greater volumes of bandwidth without
any explanation but their lack of incentives for efficiency. I reflect
on my relationship with technology every day, yet I still became an
oblivious data glutton in mind-bogglingly little time.

The current state of connectivity in the United States, alone is quite
alarming under 5-year-absent examination. Mobile carriers are
https://www.reuters.com/article/us-sprint-corp-m-a-t-mobile-us/t-mobile-runs-behind-the-scenes-pr-push-to-support-sprint-deal-idUSKCN1L512A[_still_
merging] and the compartmentalization of _all_ ISP customers between
prioritization tiers continues to be tested,
https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/24/17882842/us-internet-broadband-map-isp-fcc-wireless-competition[less
encumbered by regulatory safeguards] than ever. I don't know my politics
on this issue, nor do I have any specific solutions, but I'd point to
the work of the http://digitalinclusion.org/[National Digital Inclusion
Alliance], and express only that I hope the pace of the technology's
progress is greater than the growth of its merchants' imaginations and
the scope of their greed so that the sheer volume of plenty overcomes
even the shortest-sighted, and humanity as a whole continues toward a
more just distribution of connectivity. What I _am_ in a position to
share are the revelations about our current infrastructure, software
services, and hardware devices I could only have discovered from such an
experience.

[[section0054.xhtml#variables]]
=== Variables

I remember standing on top of a John Deere combine's 15ft-high roof in
order to successfully make a telephone call 10 years ago ‚Äì one of
thousands of behaviors which were more abruptly and universally required
for a few years and subsequently more abruptly forgotten than any other
such united tick in American history. This blip of shared technological
adversity also led to an unfathomably vast collective mythology
surrounding incredibly tedious manipulation of our archaic handsets in
varying degrees of desperation for _just one bar_.

My Sprint plan includes unlimited 4G LTE data for my iPhone 8 Plus with
a 10GB tethering limit ‚Äì which performed so admirably in the lonely role
of my thin tether to the rest of the world that I am obligated to
actually use the phrase *_like a champ_*, but the quality of its
connection is dramatically impacted by the studio apartment's depth.
From the space's geometric center at stomach-level, the handset
indicates ‚Äú1x,‚Äù meaning CDMA 1x, which _is_ technically a data
connection, but certainly not in any usable sense for the network
applications of 2018. The native Twitter app, Apple Mail, Snapchat,
Instagram & Facebook, Safari, Opera Mini, Firefox, Chrome, and all
others I tested in this condition would simply timeout ‚Äì giving up after
a minute or two of repeated attempts before declining to continue, each
in their own minor variations. An interesting anecdote: in a pertinent
reflection our human ballooning expectations for connectivity at all
times, the language of our creations across both iOS and desktop
applications has recently become noticeably less accountable and more
accusatory. Instead of saying ‚Äú____ can‚Äôt connect to the internet,‚Äù many
of the browsers will declare an absolute: _there is no internet
connection_, or just straight up *blame* the user: ‚Äú_you_ are not
connected to the internet.‚Äù (Emphasis mine.) No apologies... No regrets.

`Dude, no wifi? Where the fuck are U?`

Directly above my head‚Äôs place on the bed, the phone could be propped on
the sill of the East-facing window on a clear-skied day, enabling it to
scrounge up and loosely establish enough contact to receive calls and
text messages, claiming 1-4 3G ‚Äúbars,‚Äù and a single in 4G at night,
though one overcast Northwestern week basically did it in completely. If
we were actually doing something to noticeably increase our old Nokia
boxes‚Äô bandwidth bids on those early networks by turning them every
which way to find ‚Äúbetter reception,‚Äù it‚Äôs completely futile on current
devices. (I‚Äôm fairly sure I remember a network professional explaining
this to me when LTE was first gaining traction.) It was immediately
apparent that orientation had no effect, but the handset‚Äôs bearing
certainly did‚Ä¶ Most sensitively so. I realized quite early on that I
should endeavor not to spend too much time standing in different
positions throughout the space attempting to will on a browser loader
bar above a story I‚Äôve probably read already. Intstead, I committed to
the very first position that indicated any correlation whatsoever with a
better connection: atop the biscuit tin on the metal rack nearest the
outside door.

It‚Äôs been three months, but I‚Äôm still using my tired old Hewlett-Packard
6930p http://bilge.world/linux-bitch/[backup machine], so I was very
skeptical about the odds we‚Äôd be successfully reliably pairing its
ancient network adapter ‚Äì http://a.co/d/ij9mfeD[now worth just $9.99] ‚Äì
with that of A Cellular Phone 10 years its junior without struggling
significantly with range or reliability, especially considering that it
cannot run a single one of its
https://support.hp.com/us-en/document/c01538039[vast library of
proprietary drivers] on Linux. You‚Äôd at least assume they‚Äôd need to be
practically touching each other to maintain a smooth marriage, yet the
only compromise I had to make on the local end was to bring them near to
each other as they paired. Afterwards, I could return the phone to its
tin and work on the laptop from the kitchen table, 12-15 feet away.
(Curiously enough, the 6930p itself shipped with hotspot capability by
way of the SIM card slot behind the unit‚Äôs main battery.)

Quantifying the speed of a mobile data connection as you would a
dedicated WiFi network is incongruent because the former trades in a
much less consistent packet stream. That‚Äôs the extent of my knowledge,
but it‚Äôs easy to visualize: a signal that can travel a mile or two in
big globules bound to be intercepted in splashes upon the device‚Äôs
little antennae, versus your home network‚Äôs local, evenly distributed
sauna of irradiated mist. It‚Äôs much less definite, to say the least, and
I can‚Äôt actually comprehend the sort of voodoo that‚Äôs required in order
to expand and maintain the networks as they are, nor would I ever wish
to burden myself with such knowledge.

I have to just *_fucking do it_*‚Äâ‚Äî‚ÄâI‚Äôm going to start writing about
music in this space. There‚Äôs virtually zero chance that I‚Äôll shout over
other voices of music criticism as long as _Bilge_ remains so poorly
optimized for SEO, and Portland, Oregon has been far too confusing to
deprive myself the opportunity to work out _any_ understanding of its
youth culture. It‚Äôs not a lack of talented musicians in the area‚Äâ‚Äî‚Äâthe
opposite is true‚Äâ‚Äî‚Äâbut a severe drought of the kind of tragedy and
trauma which ultimately give acoustic American musical expression _its
whole shit_. What I caught of the weekend‚Äôs invasion with Santa Cruz
musicians were all praiseworthy, tight and confident performers who‚Äôd
obviously invested heavily in their equipment and their presence here.
https://joekaplow.bandcamp.com/[Joe Kaplow] arrived with a sort of

preferred their availability, and wouldn‚Äôt use ‚Äúmore than a few at
once,‚Äù and seemed almost genuinely perturbed by my attempt to explain
the specific industrially-influenced involvement of audio hardware in
hardcore punk and grind performance which I was referring to with the

these parts, and I‚Äôm sure he was actually just _utterly uninterested_.)

No more than two dozen guests made up their peak crowd of witnesses, yet
Joe and his band certainly made good on shear effort expended in laying
down a hearty, back-to-back recital for us at an unusually protracted
rate, though apparently either they, the
https://getawaydogs.bandcamp.com/[Getaway Dogs], or
https://thecurfews.bandcamp.com/[The Curfews] had insisted that a ‚Äúcover
charge‚Äù be collected at the door of the house show. It‚Äôs not my business
to to dwell on or attempt to investigate an unsubstantiatable rumor, but
I understand this could have been a breach of house show etiquette. What
I _do_ know is that one of the visiting musicians stole 4 flat AA
batteries out of my https://flic.kr/s/aHsmqBwfDZ[COOLPIX] and
_apparently_ attempted to jack its ancient Compact Flash card, which is
only hilarious because they didn‚Äôt succeed. Regardless, it should be
said that Joe Kaplow‚Äôs songwriting is more flattered by

Reflection upon just about anything can have personal meaning, but no
amount of musicianship can mask a stark lack of context. I do wonder if
Indie Folk should just return to the megachurch, where songwriters like
Joe and musicians of his crew‚Äôs sort are literally _handed_ a gigantic
audience of trained experts at finding profound meaning where it
probably isn‚Äôt, along with great salaries, from what I hear. Otherwise,
all that taxing preparation and expenditure will only lead to more
forgettable performances. Or perhaps I am simply misguided in my
assumption that artists work exclusively to communicate _something_
lasting to _someone_. Every conversation I‚Äôve had with Portlanders about
Portland music has been predominantly about what artists and their
audiences wear and how they behave instead of _what they‚Äôre trying to
say_. There‚Äôs nothing inherently wrong with leaving things petty,
lyrically and choosing to remain content with established sounds,
musically, as long as your work is advertised as *entertainment, not
performance*.

<a href="http://thecigaretteburns.bandcamp.com/album/demos-2015">Demos
2015 by The Cigarette Burns</a>

Before I came Northwest, my fianc√© had been exposing me to a variety of
its music, which I mostly tolerated politely. Dozens of albums and EPs
were played through once and forgotten forever, but when I arrived at
http://thecigaretteburns.bandcamp.com/album/demos-2015[a demo tape]
recorded by her long time friend‚Äôs band,
https://thecigaretteburns.bandcamp.com/[_The Cigarette Burns_], I
finally heard something familiar, yet vitally compelling: pissed off
punks having fun. That said, I should admit that I only attended
Saturday‚Äôs show because he was on the ticket, and I‚Äôm still glad I did.

After what felt like hours of drowsy corn cob pipes, Christmas sweaters,
and old sweethearts at fifty beats per minute (there were literally two
young men sleeping within 15 feet of the bands for the duration,) Ricky
sat himself on a stool in the midst of Kaplow‚Äôs sprawling gear load at
2:30AM with only his guitar and his voice. Unfortunately, I‚Äôd squandered
the Nikon‚Äôs batteries on Californians (the lighting was not ideal
anyway,) so I thought I‚Äôd share
https://www.pscp.tv/AsphaltApostle/1gqxvXNPRaBGB?t=5s[his set on
Periscope]. Though Ricky had been patiently present and attentive for
the entire night (unlike myself,) those who were left of the
entertainers bolted to the porch for a lively discussion about unicycles
and quinoa while Ricky told us about hate, jealousy, and feeling like
shit in a somber elegy. Any further adjectives may edge dangerously
close to a half-assed ‚Äúconcert review,‚Äù which I am _not_ yet qualified
for, but I will say that Ricky‚Äôs sincerity made him most engaging part
of the night, and his frustrated, conclusive nod to The Cigarette Burns
was the first _real_ punk sounds I‚Äôve yet heard in Portland.

image:xhtml/https:/i.snap.as/hNtIUA6.jpg[Indie Folk Battery Burglary]

I realize sharing this small experience does little to grow the
conversation, but this isn‚Äôt a magazine, and *I am desperate for
answers* about the bizarre reality in which I find myself.
https://youtu.be/zJONjVnDADI?t=1050[When Ricky dedicated a song to
Courtney Love], one of the male musicians(?) yelled ‚ÄúCourtney Love
fuckin‚Äô killed Kurt Cobain!‚Äù which was _such_ an unbelievably clich√©
happening/decision that I‚Äôll surely spend the rest of my days in this
city unsuccessfully attempting to work it out, aloud. I can‚Äôt quite
recall who it was last Fall that responded to my frustration by
challenging ‚Äúwhat if there‚Äôs nothing to understand?‚Äù While this may be a
reasonable conclusion, I suspect it‚Äôs not one I could accept as long as
I remain here without losing my mind. If Portland is truly the
dimensionless bastion of apathy and intellectual stagnancy for young
Americans, I must _blog my way out it_ as soon as possible (for Pete‚Äôs
sake, just give these kids some antidepressants,) but I‚Äôd still like to
believe the idea too oxymoronic to actually exist.

[[section0056.xhtml#the-duo-s-new-album-manages-to-be-wonderfully-explorative-without-sacrificing-any-sacred-traditions]]
=== The duo's new album manages to be wonderfully explorative without sacrificing any sacred traditions.

For years, I took the voices and culture of working Americans for
granted and sought to generally distance myself from my origin‚Äôs
heritage as much as possible, but I‚Äôve since realized that I couldn‚Äôt
have done so without absolute certainty that country, bluegrass, and
folk music were stubborn as State highway ditch-rooted fescue blades:
omnipresent forces of Midwestern nature that‚Äôd secured their
invincibility with the simple superiority of their belonging. While this
conclusion is true enough for the time being, it‚Äôs quite independently
so of their worth or necessity. In such conditional blindness, I‚Äôve
simply proven my sensibilities to be (predictably in the case of my
seniors) not exempt. This truth is noteworthy only because of its
potential to spare others the embarrassment of blatant ignorance to
their own privilege. That said, I would suggest that you engage this
music sincerely for a moment for your own sake, regardless of your own
convictions regarding country music, Indiana, plaid, pickup trucks, the
end of the world, or the proper noun for ‚Äúcantaloupe.‚Äù

As young adults, even those folks who‚Äôve remained resolutely
country-minded found themselves trivializing the name of the titanic
Dallas-born trio The Dixie Chicks not out of half-assed iconoclasm, but
because their brand was so cleverly immune to irony. You thought you
were proving yourself of a higher caliber of discernment, but mocking
goddesses only paraded your ignorance. In my teen rebellion against the
culture of my rural origin, I scoffed at their mention for a while,
somehow oblivious to my blatant hypocrisy. Thanks to my older sisters
and their automobiles, I spent before and after elementary school days
absorbing thousands of hours‚Äô worth of late-90s/early-oughts Pop Country
radio. Two summers ago, I returned to this library at length for the
first time in 10 years and found my heart completely vulnerable to its
related memories and my mind consistently flabbergasted by the oomph of
the composition that defines the genre‚Äôs last mainstream hurrah.

The original three Chicks ‚Äì Natalie Maines, Emily Robison, and Marty
Maguire ‚Äì are still very much alive, kicking, and radio-playing. They
even
‚Äúhttps://www.tennessean.com/story/entertainment/music/2016/08/16/dixie-chicks-long-road-back-exile/88762752/[returned
from exile]‚Äù with a real international tour in 2016. (I regret little
more in my adult life than missing the opportunity to see them.)
According to
https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/nov/19/the-dixie-chicks-tour-is-country-music-ready-to-forgive[a
fascinating November 2015 analysis] in The Guardian, their 2003
denouncement of President George W. Bush cost them serious cred among
their audience, but Johnny Cash likely
https://www.thenation.com/article/johnny-cash-was-not-republican[harbored
similar sentiments], Stephen Morrissey is‚Ä¶
https://web.archive.org/web/20131024020237/http:/true-to-you.net/morrissey_news_131019_01[not
straight], the most worthwhile current country sounds from my teenage
home are https://cowgirljordy.bandcamp.com/[composed and performed by a
trans woman], and the staple tunes from the genre‚Äôs most chaste
personalities are often https://youtu.be/yCmsZUN4r_s[just about sex]. No
reasonable individual would still cite this incident in an argument
opposing the essential legacy of these three miraculously talented
women.

From a pop perspective at least, The Dixie Chicks are almost certainly
the penultimate expression of country music as a technical and emotional
exercise. Their extraordinary musicianship and prodigally antecedent
mastery of suave sincerity represented the absolute peak of pop
country‚Äôs untenable relationship with the American working class in one
hell of a 21st-century-breaching last hurrah that still brings tears of
pride to many an eye. However, the hysterical backlash of the greater
working people personified in part by Donald Trump‚Äôs presidency is a
last sure indication of the mainstream‚Äôs final estrangement from all
distillations of rural culture. In the coming years, I fear the toiling
masses will be left only with less and less authentic, more and more
suburban bastardizations of their music as the last superficial
delusions of condescending affection from the middle class fade, and the
enterprise dies. What does survive will ‚Äúgraduate‚Äù (retire) to Folk (for
white performers,) and further strengthen the Blues resurrection (for
everyone else.) That said, it‚Äôs hard to find anyone who‚Äôs comfortable
mourning the loss openly after acceptance has progressively set in ‚Äì
there‚Äôs simply nowhere else to go, and its aging icons have been in
desperate need of retirement throughout the Information Age.

_The Top 10 Vegan Alternatives to Working-Class America_

Even if I‚Äôd had the moderate exposure from my current perch in the midst
of the notoriously grass-roots nature of Portland‚Äôs Folk/Blues scene,
2000 miles west, I would have still been totally blindsided by my
incidental introduction to The Matchsellers, two years ago. One needn‚Äôt
harbor any presumptions about the relationship between Kansas City
violinist/fiddler Julie Bates and Hoosier blues guitarist, Andrew Morris
‚Äì they‚Äôre just about the cutest pair you‚Äôll ever see, couple‚Äôs act or
not (it‚Äôs less relevant than you‚Äôd think, and none of our business.)
They‚Äôre also extremely talented and genuinely authoritative world-class
musicians with plenty of authentic country mileage who exude a proud air
of warm, confident serenity occupying the bluegrass sphere. After
happening upon their set at Columbia‚Äôs faux-speakeasy in Summer 2016, I
was at once charmed and impressed by the pervasive magnitude of the
ethereal aura that followed them, especially after our brief
post-performance conversation. I‚Äôm ninety percent sure they came without
a mobile phone between them carrying a wicker basket full of CDs and
matchbooks, and shucks‚Ä¶ I do believe we‚Äôve been doing this whole thing
wrong, all along.

County by The Matchsellers</a>

I bought a copy of
https://thematchsellers.bandcamp.com/album/kosciusko-county[Kosciusko
County] then and there and played the shit out of it the next summer,
wandering aimlessly around Missouri with my best friend, revisiting (and
occasionally disrupting) the resolute peace of the tiny communities I
grew up orbiting. On our way to the Hannibal ‚Äì Huckleberry‚Äôs Fictional
home/the great Mississippi‚Äôs tired tourism machine ‚Äì we just left it on
repeat. As a soundtrack to such sentimental pursuits, a central trio of
back-to-back tracks proved especially potent, beginning with
‚Äúhttps://thematchsellers.bandcamp.com/track/mentone-the-3000-lb-egg[Mentone
(The 3,000 lb Egg)]‚Äù ‚Äì the work‚Äôs nostalgic, tear-jerking sole
instrumental. Production isn‚Äôt low-fidelity, but appropriately honest ‚Äì
no amount of expensive mastering would be capable of compressing the
essence of a surprise late-night live performance from The Matchsellers‚Äô
work into a digital audio file, anyway.

Bates‚Äô fiddling is an impossibly rare pleasure ‚Äì the real type of sawing
that mystically manages to erase one‚Äôs inhibitions and sense of civic
responsibility when tearing about the borders of quiet row-crop plots,
leaving long-lived lesions of billowing limestone high above numbered
county roads at ninety miles-per-hour. Succeeding the distant,
eye-misting cruise of the 1.5-ton Egg,
‚Äúhttps://thematchsellers.bandcamp.com/track/driving-escort[Driving
Escort]‚Äù is a masterpiece (naturally) of this raucous realm.

_Driving down the road with a yellow light on top of my truck / Going
down to Vincennes earning my sixty bucks._

Add the accompaniment of Morris‚Äô obviously-fathomless relationship with
the guitar, and the result nails a select truth without any hint of
prudishness. At sufficient volume,
‚Äúhttps://thematchsellers.bandcamp.com/track/muskmelon-breakdown[Muskmelon
Breakdown]‚Äù becomes a beautifully-harmonious catalyst of fast, loose,
maniacal, hilarious energy that‚Äôs sure to land you in a ditch, but
you‚Äôll still be laughing your ass off by the time you‚Äôre pulling clay
clumps and waist-high fescue blades from your steaming radiator.
_Kosciusko County_ isn‚Äôt an innovative record by any critical
instrumentation, but I‚Äôd do best to keep my sun-faded, skip-worn copy
readily at hand for the next time I find myself on a fresh gravel road,
whenever that may be.

That‚Äôs it, then ‚Äì we‚Äôve got The Matchsellers pretty well figured for
either wannabe(?) or reformed(?) yahoos of their own design; charming,
dusty novelties who chose a folly destiny of toiling their craft for
none but a seasonal dozen acres of white, sweating State Fair flesh.
Obviously, they‚Äôre meant for us sophisticated, globetrotting Winners to
collect like thrift store antiques on our way down the interstate. Their
time is ours to book for nothing on our mediocre ‚Äúspeakeasy‚Äôs‚Äù waxy new
stage; to post on an Instagram story, to Tweet in an easy
compartmentalization of their quaint displacement from our time, deep in
the dusty recesses of our collections for no good bargain, where they‚Äôll
fall comfortably in line as our predictable and willing country servants
should an opportunity happen upon us to show a stranger how interesting,
dynamic, and worldly we are.

As a displaced (and formerly ex-communicated) yokel, I‚Äôve often been
astonished by how easy it is to discard American folk music for huge
swaths of time unless it expresses some unignorable sort of spectacular
torment. My own failure to recognize the value in this one until I
became separated and homesick was an overtly foolhardy clich√© (though
quite predictable of like privilege,) but I can‚Äôt help but wonder: *is
it unavoidable?* Of course, the process is necessary for ‚Äòclass justice‚Äô
‚Äì one might even call it a natural law of sorts ‚Äì and in the case of The
Matchsellers, there‚Äôs hardly a struggle to communicate emotionally. For
a real music scholar, though, it‚Äôs surely worth asking of those voices
who know: do the oppressed, destitute, and hope-impoverished people of
this country still rely on bluegrass, or has it been replaced for them?

The abstraction of the phrase ‚Äúgood surprise‚Äù had plummeted from our
collective vocabulary at a record-demolishing velocity in the interim,
but this past spring‚Äôs release of
https://thematchsellers.bandcamp.com/album/bluegrastronauts[_Bluegrastronauts_]
hit me squarely upside the skull again, stirring a solid half hour of
hysterical, shrieking psychosis. I assumed the worst‚Ä¶ _Dear God, what
has the internet forced upon that sweet, rootsy duo_?! ‚Äì and was
immediately compelled to drop everything and listen.

<a
href="http://thematchsellers.bandcamp.com/album/bluegrastronauts">Bluegrastronauts
by The Matchsellers</a>

_Hoosiers, we have a problem_. What the fuck is this album, exactly? A
nonchalant, apparently oblivious challenge to every assumption you could
possibly arrive with. It‚Äôs safe to suppose ‚ÄúBluegrastronauts‚Äù refers to
its departure from the rest of their discography ‚Äì from smack dab in
Indiana‚Äôs center to the goddamned Beta Quadrant, the two managed to
stupefyingly ace a theme most comfortable residents of their bluegrass
sphere would take care to avoid leaving up on the kitchen whiteboard ‚Äì
even tackling apocalypse with regal serenity. At first glance, I was
sure that copious soft glow had to either be the false product of my own
insanity, or a deliberate attempt to alienate the sum of their audience
in a single crises of identity. In fact, The Matchsellers had pulled off
yet another especially-sparse artistic miracle and harnessed their
creative restlessness to propel their departure from the elderly genre‚Äôs
pretensions without spilling a single drip of their secret sauce. It‚Äôs
not a concept album (thank God,) but doesn‚Äôt wander in any disparaging
sense, either.

Name-dropping four bluegrass legends within the number 1 album-titled
introductory track is the pair‚Äôs single self-conscious acknowledgment of
visiting folk fanatics: this CD looks crazy, but we know what we‚Äôre
doing ‚Äì and Kansas City‚Äôs mention accredits the locale of the following
entirely Missouri-made production. Indeed, in the WhoDoneIts, you‚Äôll see
The HillBenders‚Äô https://www.instagram.com/p/Bfwh-rmhcet/[Chad Graves]
layed em‚Äô down in Springfield, and Johnny Kenepaske‚Äôs
https://deadhorsesoundcompany.com/[Dead Horse Sound Company] spread em‚Äô
around in the Heart of America, itself. Missourian musicians especially
should take note of these names: the offerings may have diversified
since my day, but sound talent like this is difficult to come across,
even within explosive college towns. Cutting two live acoustic tracks
per performer ‚Äì four in total ‚Äì while expecting to retain any subsequent
control over the behavior of either unwanted or subject sound is as
difficult as any other circumstance you‚Äôll encounter in studio
production at this level. I know this much (but little more in that
direction): real sound control is simply too tedious to bear for
monomiking rascals with GarageBand. Now, having lost or been estranged
from any remotely-professional sound reproduction equipment,
_Bluegrastronauts_ sounds as balanced and polished as my wired Apple
earbuds could ever convey.

In shared verses, Julie and Andrew‚Äôs charmed harmonies are separated
beautifully about the listener without inducing a sense of lateral
imbalance when one of them sings alone. (Admittedly, I don‚Äôt exactly
know how it‚Äôs accomplished.) No single personality in the record‚Äôs
toolset ‚Äì guitar, fiddle, banjo, bass, or dobro steps over any other.

I have no idea who‚Äôs listening, but I‚Äôm positive their numbers should be
multiplying by a hundredfold very quickly, filling especially with all
of ye who feel abandoned by all authentic American representation. They
shouldn‚Äôt ever fill up stadiums or establishment radiowaves, nor should
their art invite extensive pretentious dissection, but they will be
adored.

It‚Äôs a quintessential manner of Country Boy pride to whip the middle
class‚Äôs condescension right back around with a classic demonstration:
Oh, you thought I didn‚Äôt know about that? You thought I couldn‚Äôt _do_
that? Well, of course I can! I‚Äôm just not particularly interested. The
Matchsellers, though, have attained a much higher tier of comfort and
confidence in their own skin.

Ten percent of the United States' adult population cannot functionally
read or write (http://literacy.kent.edu/[conservatively]) despite the
exponential increase of required reading in the average American's
day-to-day life thus far in the 21stcentury. For written American media,
especially, one would assume that a financial and social incentive for
maximum literacy in the populace should present a straightforward
justification for intense widespread coverage of this particular
disparity, yet most related coverage in mainstream national magazines
and newspapers is alarmingly sparse and often requires a
less-than-socially-conscious context (e.g. a
https://www.fastcompany.com/90259739/this-mobile-learning-platform-aims-to-combat-the-hidden-epidemic-of-adult-illiteracy[for-profit
startup]) to actually appear in news feeds. From the most wholesome
assumption of the industry's general values ‚Äî that it holds
‚Äúhttps://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/newsworthy[newsworthiness]‚Äù
above all ‚Äî we must assume that it does not generally consider American
illiteracy ‚Äúinteresting enough to the general public to warrant
reporting‚Äù as we examine the intermittent discourse surrounding the
issue that _does_ achieve publication.

In late October, the American business and technology magazine _Fast
Company_ covered the recent successes of the ‚Äúfor-profit social
enterprise‚Äù Cell-Ed, noting that ‚Äúa huge portion of the American labor
force is illiterate,‚Äù which it described as ‚Äúa hidden epidemic.‚Äù The
article's author, Rick Wartzman, mentions foremost that Cell-Ed's
userbase is largely ‚Äúforeign-born‚Äù and expected to eclipse one million
in number by the end of 2019. Demographically, the magazine's readership
is predominantly middle to upper-class, who are the least affected
social groups by a significant margin as per illiteracy's strong
correlative relationship with poverty. These factors combine to limit
any real social consequences from such an article.

In direct contrast with the professional, market-minded perspective of
modern business magazine, even niche independent publications from the
opposite end of the media spectrum often trivialize, belittle, or
generally mishandle the issue. In
https://www.baptiststandard.com/opinion/editorials/if-you-can-read-this-be-thankful/[a
500-word ‚ÄúEditorial‚Äù] written by _The_ Editor
https://twitter.com/EricBlackBSP[Eric Black] of the _Baptist Standard_ ‚Äî
a small evangelical news website describing itself as ‚ÄúBaptist voices
speaking to the challenges of today's world‚Äù ‚Äî he points to a _global_
increase in ‚Äúilliterate people,‚Äù as he so comfortably brands them. Such
language is inevitably counter-productive and potentially insensitive:
to the eyes and ears of activists, educators, and the general public,
such a term unnecessarily lends toward a restricted perspective of those
people who have been left behind by the institution of read and written
language in one manner or another and portrays them as a great vague
collection of lingual lepers bearing their own distinct, inexorable,
wordless ethnicity which _inevitably_ bars them from the freedoms
allowed by the Editor's learned capacity, including the ability to
actually read his words of affliction. Simply put, he has dangerously
oversimplified the issue.

To once again assume the best and infer that Black had a specific
purpose in publishing his ill-supported opinion beyond continuity's sake
of https://www.baptiststandard.com/opinion/editorials/[his weekly
Editorials], it appears to be the promotion of a local Texan literacy
‚Äúministry‚Äù called http://www.literacyconnexus.org/[Literacy Connexus],
though no further specifics about the project are provided beyond
‚Äúhelping churches develop literacy programs for their communities,
provide training and resources to overcome illiteracy,‚Äù which is
virtually identical to the introductory copy on
http://www.literacyconnexus.org/[the organization's homepage].

So far, we've examined coverage only in special interest media, but what
about legacy news organizations with the largest readerships in the
United States? Despite oblivious use of the same ledes, a newspaper like
_The Washington Post_ can wield vast influence over the broadest
possible readership and the public editorial trust. In November 2016,
veteran reporter Valerie Strauss published
‚Äúhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/news/answer-sheet/wp/2016/11/01/hiding-in-plain-sight-the-adult-literacy-crisis/[Hiding
in plain sight: The adult literacy crisis]‚Äù for _Answer Sheet_ ‚Äî her
weekly newsletter designed to function as ‚Äúa school survival guide for
parents (and everyone else), from education policy to psychology‚Äù ‚Äî
which represents the most substantial discussion of American illiteracy
in topical, widely-visible media (i.e. presence in a succinct search
engine query.) She briefly introduces the issue with a bulleted list of
illiteracy's consequences on modern society and the individual cited
from a https://www.fondationalphabetisation.org/en/[Canadian literacy
foundation] before turning the stage over to
https://aohdc.org/about-us/staff/lecester-johnson-chief-executive-officer/[Lecester
Johnson], CEO of the
https://aohdc.org/about-us/staff/lecester-johnson-chief-executive-officer/[Academy
of Hope Adult Public Charter School] in Washington D.C.

Johnson presents a passionate and well-informed exploration of the state
of the literacy battle from the perspective of a full-time, locally
on-the-ground advocate. Her op-ed's introduction includes the most
essential observations and statistics throughout, noting ‚Äúthe children
of parents with low literacy skills are more likely to live in poverty
as adults and are five times more likely to drop out of school,‚Äù before
setting upon a detailed examination of current and relevant
organizations working toward _solutions_. Of course, it's largely
centered upon her own organization, which she claims has ‚Äúhelped more
than 6000 adults rebuild their education and job opportunities since
1985.‚Äù

It's significant that an institution as deeply embedded across the
American political spectrum as _The Washington Post_ address the issue
of American illiteracy, and both Johnson and Strauss are certainly
qualified voices for the undertaking, but when we examine this
particular article, it's important we consider the context of the
_Answer Sheet_ newsletter and its intended audience. Though it's no
challenge to pitch the importance of reading and writing to parents and
professional educators, the most alarming and destructive issue at hand
is the educational disparity between _their adult peers_. ‚ÄúThere's a
literacy problem in the capitol, but I'm not talking about young people
who can't read. Many adults ‚Äî perhaps even parents sitting next to you
at back to school night ‚Äî don't possess academic skills,‚Äù notes Johnson
with her very first paragraph. However, considering the nature of
parenthood, the audience primarily consuming these words are undoubtedly
preoccupied with _juvenile_ issues, specifically, and we can assume
their capacity to empathize with their fellow working adults who could
benefit from literacy education is actually _lessened_ from that of
childless readers of the same age as a result. ‚ÄúDespite the magnitude of
the adult literacy crisis, most of those needing to make up lost ground
are pushed toward traditional classroom settings‚Äîeven though many of
these people can't possibly follow through because of cost or work
schedules or other obstacles,‚Äù she attests.

Perhaps more than any other American city, Detroit has been struggling
with a serious illiteracy problem. According to
https://www.wxyz.com/news/conquering-illiteracy-one-neighborhood-at-a-time-with-beyond-basics-program[a
profile of the Beyond Basics program] (which was adapted from an
embedded video broadcast) on their local ABC affiliate's website,
forty-seven percent of adult Detroiters cannot read, but even companies
like General Motors ‚Äî who donated \$250,000 to the Beyond Basics program
earlier in mid-October ‚Äî are getting involved. The article quotes Elijah
Craft, a young man who was ‚Äúreading at a first-grade level as a senior
at Detroit's Central High School.‚Äù ‚ÄúCraft would rare venture from home
for fear he would get lost because he could not read street signs,‚Äù
reports _WXYZ_ anchor
https://www.wxyz.com/about-us/staff/carolyn-clifford[Carolyn Clifford].
She frames the narrative around a reference to the 2009 film _The Blind
Side_ starring Sandra Bullock: ‚Äúhere, you might call this story 'The
Detroit Side.'‚Äù For local television news, this reference to popular
culture likely strengthened the story's power ensnare viewers' emotional
attention when it was aired, and even in this written accompaniment, it
proves an effective ‚Äî if a bit crude ‚Äî analogy. The broadcast of Mr.
Craft's interview also depicts his own deep emotional investment in
reading when he begins to shed tears, which is not entirely communicated
in the written article.

When the American news media discusses American illiteracy, it's almost
always in secondary or tertiary form: either by way of a short post for
a weekly education newsletter, an ultra-low-distribution niche editorial
column, or a personality profile of a local activist. Perhaps the
fundamental obstacle in the face of increasing the discourse surrounding
this issue is that its resolutions will require ‚Äî perhaps more than any
other social issue in this country ‚Äî advocacy by those who _can_ read on
behalf of those who _cannot_ because of how sensitive and isolated many
of them feel. When voices of advocates like Lecester Johnson _are_
uplifted by major organizations like _The Washington Post_, the
sociological weight of the illiteracy issue can be very powerful. In
quoting former United Nations chief Kofi Annan, she sums up for its
extensive audience what the facts should ultimately mean to them: 32
million of Eric Black's so-called ‚Äúilliterate people‚Äù in the United
States of America have been and continue to be deprived of their
‚Äú*_human right_*‚Äù to functional literacy.

=== Seven years ago, the fourth generation of Apple‚Äôs iPhone instigated a change in our perception of digital photography. Now ‚Äì thanks to Google Photos ‚Äì I‚Äôd like to reflect on my favorite shots of mine.

When iPhone 4 handsets began shipping in the Summer of 2010, I‚Äôd been
carrying my first generation for three solid years ‚Äì since its now
history-stricken release, in fact ‚Äì and its age started to become a
problem. I‚Äôd drop it screen-down on a rock in the airport parking lot
just before going back to school for my Junior year, splitting a crack
in the screen that wouldn‚Äôt quite kill it ‚Äì it was the demands of iOS 4
on its 412 MHz CPU and meager 128 MB of RAM that would ultimately cease
its usability.

The single 2 megapixel rear-facing camera would surprise one at times,
but was never lauded as anything but what it was ‚Äì a mobile phone-bound
sensor capturing very cellular-looking* images, but Steve Jobs wasn‚Äôt
https://youtu.be/z__jxoczNWc?t=2m10s[three minutes in] to his iPhone 4
presentation at the June 2010 Worldwide Developer‚Äôs Conference before he
pronounced the design‚Äôs closest possible ‚Äúkin‚Äù to be ‚Äúan old Leica
camera,‚Äù associating his device with photography in its first
impression. The equivalent of the first generation‚Äôs rear-facing camera
could now be found facing _you_, and the fourth‚Äôs primary sensor now
shot at 5 megapixels (2592 x 1936) with autofocus and 5x digital zoom,
setting a fundamental smartphone sensor configuration
https://www.theverge.com/2014/9/9/6125849/iphone-history-pictures[standard]
that‚Äôs still adhered to by the industry.

After unleashing Google Photos upon the ~15,000 images on my home
machine‚Äôs hard drive last year, I have been constantly reminded of my
own photographic history ‚Äì for better or worse ‚Äì and regularly shown
five, six, seven-year old snaps in a manner that wouldn‚Äôt have been
possible (or have made any sense) before. Recently, I was astounded to
find that I took many of the better shots with my iPhone 4, so I thought
I‚Äôd share a few from my high-school days in loving memory of my trusty
little rectangular companion.

Now, I have to stop myself from dig¬≠ging too deep here and attempt¬≠ing
some¬≠thing absurd like _The His¬≠to¬≠ry of Twit¬≠ter Clients_, but the
fuck¬≠ing mate¬≠r¬≠i¬≠al is there! I could spend an entire after¬≠noon going
through YouTube search¬≠es and gad¬≠get blogs because it brings me back to
that time when I lived every day assum¬≠ing these things were going to
con¬≠tin¬≠ue to aston¬≠ish for my entire adult¬≠hood. So many incred¬≠i¬≠ble
ideas! _How¬≠ev¬≠er,_ I‚Äôm going to save them for lat¬≠er and focus on the
cream of the crop, so to speak: *Twit¬≠terif¬≠ic* and *Tweet¬≠bot*, which
has been a long¬≠time favorite of mine. As I said, it was in com¬≠mu¬≠ni¬≠ty
col¬≠lege that I first ponied up mon¬≠ey for Tweet¬≠bot 3 on my iPhone 4S
sim¬≠ply because the hype over it among app and gad¬≠get nerds was _so
bonkers_ that it man¬≠aged to spill over into my life, despite the fact
that iOS7 and I were hav¬≠ing seri¬≠ous issues in our mar¬≠riage.

If you trust Mark Wat¬≠son with your life as I do, you‚Äôd bet¬≠ter believe
that Tweet¬≠bot has been ‚Äúhttps://youtu.be/DE1YHcoPxMk[a scream¬≠er]‚Äù
since its very begin¬≠ning, when it pio¬≠neered the _Pre¬≠mi¬≠um Poweruser_
seg¬≠ment, for which a demo¬≠graph¬≠ic appar¬≠ent¬≠ly still exists. It was
_fast_, yet always notice¬≠ably smoother than the native app, just as the
newest release is today. I must point out, though, that the blog¬≠gers
and YouTu¬≠bers who‚Äôve insist¬≠ed that Tweet¬≠bot or Twit¬≠ter¬≠rif¬≠ic or any
oth¬≠er pre¬≠mi¬≠um app could replace the native Twit¬≠ter app entire¬≠ly on
iPhone even before they were stripped of a most live/push
func¬≠tion¬≠al¬≠i¬≠ty (which I‚Äôll come back around to in just a moment,) are
undoubt¬≠ed¬≠ly lying to them¬≠selves ‚Äî as good as they got, they nev¬≠er
over¬≠took Twitter‚Äôs own app in imme¬≠di¬≠a¬≠cy terms, which is almost
inevitably going to present fun¬≠da¬≠men¬≠tal deter¬≠rence on the part of
the active Twit¬≠ter user who intends to rid them¬≠selves of the default
pedes¬≠tri¬≠an avenue of admin¬≠is¬≠tra¬≠tion. Tweet¬≠bot solved a lot of
things, it real¬≠ly is _daft_ when it comes to noti¬≠fi¬≠ca¬≠tions. It
wouldn‚Äôt be the end of the world if they came a few hun¬≠dred sec¬≠onds
late ‚Äî it‚Äôs that they‚Äôre nev¬≠er pre¬≠dictably or con¬≠sis¬≠tent¬≠ly so,
which sev¬≠ers entire¬≠ly the human per¬≠cep¬≠tion of engaged
_plugged-in-ness_, if you will. It‚Äôs the same phe¬≠nom¬≠e¬≠na Chuck

lat¬≠er.

It‚Äôs dif¬≠fi¬≠cult to project fic¬≠tion¬≠al sce¬≠nar¬≠ios that are more
oblique and unex¬≠pect¬≠ed than the cra¬≠zi¬≠est moments from real¬≠i¬≠ty. We
all under¬≠stand this. And that under¬≠stand¬≠ing is at the core of the
human attrac¬≠tion to live¬≠ness. We don‚Äôt crave live sport¬≠ing events
because we need imme¬≠di¬≠a¬≠cy; we crave them because they rep¬≠re¬≠sent

Tweet¬≠bot is unques¬≠tion¬≠ably a more thor¬≠ough envi¬≠ron¬≠ment in which to
explore Twit¬≠ter than any oth¬≠er third par¬≠ty client, but it can‚Äôt do
the live thing. (Please do com¬≠plain to Twit¬≠ter, Inc. about the API
sit¬≠u¬≠a¬≠tion if you‚Äôre so inclined, though.) All I‚Äôm try¬≠ing to say is,
*there is no fuck¬≠ing rea¬≠son you‚Äôd delete the Twit¬≠ter app* ‚Äî hide it
away in a fold¬≠er and nev¬≠er ever open it again if it dis¬≠gusts you so,
but leave its noti¬≠fi¬≠ca¬≠tions set¬≠tings on so that it can keep itself
busy in there. Now _that_ is a smart work¬≠flow! In fact, it was mine!
And it did work for such a long time that you‚Äôd prob¬≠a¬≠bly for¬≠get about
the arrange¬≠ment in no time were there not the occa¬≠sion¬≠al obvi¬≠ous
dis¬≠crep¬≠an¬≠cies between Tweetbot‚Äôs Mention‚Äôs tab and the native app‚Äôs
instant noti¬≠fi¬≠ca¬≠tions. There has nev¬≠er been ‚Äî nor will there be, I
think ‚Äî a client for Twit¬≠ter that can replace _some_ use of its own
prop¬≠er¬≠ties.

I think Tweet¬≠bot 3 _made_ me into my own ridicu¬≠lous equiv¬≠a¬≠lent of a
‚Äúpoweruser.‚Äù Things are a lit¬≠tle hazy now, but I know that I depart¬≠ed
my main Twit¬≠ter account just before the app‚Äôs release, and I didn‚Äôt
come back until 2015. I was going to school in the same old mall
build¬≠ing that housed the tool store in which I was also work¬≠ing in
full-time, which is sure¬≠ly the only expla¬≠na¬≠tion for the
shame¬≠less¬≠ness I demon¬≠strat¬≠ed in bring¬≠ing a wire¬≠less Apple
Blue¬≠tooth key¬≠board to my class¬≠es and plac¬≠ing it behind the phone on
what¬≠ev¬≠er sur¬≠face was in front of me so that I could lean for¬≠ward and
type into iOS with my nose damned near touch¬≠ing the screen. Strange¬≠ly,
I was not able to ver¬≠i¬≠fy when Blue¬≠tooth key¬≠board sup¬≠port was added

If you‚Äôve made it this far, you‚Äôve already seen the demos and skimmed

acknowl¬≠edge that *this release of Tweet¬≠bot is like¬≠ly the last

Twit¬≠ter, Inc. has

_absorbed_. From a busi¬≠ness per¬≠spec¬≠tive, it makes sense: only ‚Äúsix

any¬≠thing we‚Äôd seen on the iPhone before and its effec¬≠tive¬≠ness as a
Twit¬≠ter tool was imme¬≠di¬≠ate¬≠ly rec¬≠og¬≠niz¬≠able in con¬≠trast with even
Jack‚Äôs brand-new app and mobile web expe¬≠ri¬≠ence. The ani¬≠ma¬≠tions were

_I would argue that this is the best Honda‚Äôs CR-V has ever or will ever
look, no thanks to http://www.extratone.com/words/inred/iphone4/[my
photographic decisions]._

After 9 or so years and over 100,000 miles, _I_ have totaled my mother‚Äôs
2010 Honda CR-V ‚Äì the car I drove cross-country for the first time at
significant distance (St. Louis to Washington, D.C. in essentially one
sitting,) and once complimented for being the best possible aesthetic
compromise of its near-universally and aggravatingly-compromised breed.
It was my her first 1st owner experience, which is frankly a bit of a
shame. If I‚Äôm completely honest, my late stepfather‚Äôs decision to outfit
this utterly utilitarian vehicle with enough kit to break the $30,000
within a segment that has always clung to the 20s as one of its truly
communicable advantages feels less-than-ideal in retrospect, but what
can I say, really? It was not exactly a proud thing, but it _did_
transport a lot of young families and shelter us as we‚Äôve navigated more
blizzard-like conditions than should be the norm for what is,
essentially, an expensive, extended Civic.

As per some particulars of my upbringing, I tend to get almost
alarmingly attached to vehicles, but it‚Äôs hard to say I‚Äôm sad to see the
CR-V go from all but the most sentimental senses. Objectively, it‚Äôs
simply not as high-value or as competent a vehicle as it and its
contemporaries are still made out to be by automotive media, pop
culture, or the presumptions in the average consumer‚Äôs discourse. Though
it was never intended to be luxurious, the resulting automobile ended up
costing real luxury money.

[[section0062.xhtml#the-event]]
=== The Event

It‚Äôs odd to have been driving so long without incident (pretty soon I‚Äôm
gonna be able to say ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been driving for twenty years, bitch!) and
then suddenly find oneself at fault for the accident which claimed the
life of the single most sublime, defining object in his existence.
_This_ incident, though, was entirely the fault of the other driver. My
best friend and I were Northbound, crossing the intersection of Stadium
Boulevard and Rock Quarry Road at precisely the point where it becomes
College Avenue, where we were t-boned directly on the CR-V‚Äôs driver‚Äôs
side rear wheel by a mid-2000s Mazda 6 that decided to run the red
light. It‚Äôs hard to guess the speed of impact, but the driver‚Äôs side
side airbags deployed (as you‚Äôll see from the attached photograph,) and
the CR-V was spun nearly 270 degrees around the axis of the front

vehicles are surely totaled.

=== Third-Generation CR-V Ownership in Retrospect

Two or three years ago, I https://youtu.be/7ucf0Hp3eKk[recorded] some
(not particularly conclusive or informative) thoughts with my iPhone as
I drove the old engorged Civic to the grocery store, when ends abruptly
after I said ‚ÄúI think one time I did try to go fast.‚Äù Like most
surviving crossover nameplates, though, the narrative began with a
genuinely good idea: Hondarize and modernize the Suzuki Sidekick
template on top of the Civic's platform and charge just a bit more for
it ‚Äì and like the rest, too, the concept has soured tremendously as both
crossovers and the compact sedans upon which they're based have grown
and fattened under their ever-increasing burden of safety and
convenience features. (I say ‚Äúburden‚Äù and not ‚Äúexpectation,‚Äù
specifically because I know a grand total of zero informed people who
are at all thrilled about increasing gross weights across every industry
segment.)

This CR-V was my mother‚Äôs first and only crossover following a three-car
line of one or two-owner-used, well-equipped V6 Accords in her garage ‚Äì
the later two from the era when Honda‚Äôs mid-sized sedan became a
surprisingly dynamic driving machine as advances in drivetrain
performance intercepted a point in the developmental timeline just
before gross weights spiked up toward their current safety and
electronic equipment-bloated figures. (In other words: in the sweet spot
when engines were growing more powerful but just before the Accord and
its peers got
http://www.speedmonkey.co.uk/2012/10/honda-from-trendsetters-to-just-another.html[_fucking
fat_].) In 2010, the CR-V was _almost_ attractive looking as specced by
http://www.extratone.com/words/inred/crosscabriolet/[my stepfather]: the
combination of the roof rack, bonnet bra, and EX-trim 5-spoke alloys
managed to resolve most of the discrepancies in the shapes I've seen
from other examples, but it also drove its price above the $30,000 mark.
To be fair to Honda, this decision could almost be considered a sortof
_breach of function_ considering the CR-V's original
ultra-mass-produced, utilitarian purpose.

[[section0062.xhtml#interior]]
==== Interior

Neither the leather nor the nav/infotainment system has aged very well,
but it should be said that the latter is still 100% functional in 2018:
it interfaces well with my iPhone 8 Plus with only the occasional ‚Äúthis
device is not supported‚Äù hiccup (easily resolvable by simply re-booting
the connection, in my experience.) I'm not sure how astonished I should
be by the fact that the GPS still offers reliable routes 99% of the
time, albeit through a user interface design that seems to grow more and
more dated by the passing few seconds one may have to wait for it to
calculate. Accommodation remains about as uncomfortable as it was on day
1: thanks to its hard leather and the super-upright seating position
common to crossovers, I must continue to insist that operating this car
is a wholly unnatural experience, but its interior surfaces shall always
place well in a contest of _robustness_ and _longevity_, as they
certainly should.

[[section0062.xhtml#drivetrain]]
==== Drivetrain

Perhaps the greatest letdown of this model year (2010) is its legacy
four-speed automatic transmission, and I assume the next year's
inclusion of a brand-new five-speed unit drastically improved its
driving experience. The specific regret one feels when such a
development arrives a year after buying any new car is one my stepfather
still didn't deserve, yet he was not spared. However, if _you_, the
reader, cannot be dissuaded from buying a CR-V of this generation for
whatever _goddamned_ reason, know that you must choose an example from
2011-onward if you want to retain your sanity. No, ye olde four-speed
wasn't quite as bad as the transmission that
https://youtu.be/zs9ScPleCTw[virtually ruined Dodge's new Dart]
singlehandedly, but it certainly shows its age even for the most
inattentive or merciless driver. Without it, I would vouch for the 2.4L
four-cylinder's performance as adequate, but its contribution was and
forever shall be let down by the aging transmission's developing
Alzheimer's. Simply put: they are an unacceptably mismatched team.

Though I shall forever argue that part-time all-wheel-drive is almost
never actually justified in normal use ‚Äì and yet inadequate for any
‚Äúextreme‚Äù use, for that matter ‚Äì Honda‚Äôs hydraulic ‚ÄúSuper-Handling
All-Wheel-Drive‚Äù did indeed aid our CR-V‚Äôs way in a handful of
circumstances throughout my mother‚Äôs ownership, though neither of our
memories of these are robust enough to cite specifics. The single
no-bullshit _blizzard_ we experienced was the same type I managed to
navigate years later in a sub-compact Chevrolet to reach MagFest 2016,
if perhaps less intense. I would speculate that the system increases
mechanical drag ‚Äì and therefore fuel consumption ‚Äì to a degree that
couldn‚Äôt possibly justify what little aid it has offered in _our_ use,
at least.

[[section0063.xhtml#apple-s-latest-mobile-os-update-might-ve-seemed-mundane-but-siri-shortcuts-gives-users-vastly-more-power-than-apple-customers-have-ever-before-experienced]]
=== Apple's latest mobile OS update might've seemed mundane, but Siri Shortcuts gives users vastly more power than Apple customers have ever before experienced.

Back in 2016, _Pok√©mon Go_, overclocked Apple Watches, pissing
wearables, and What You See is What You Get blogging services all
claimed unprecedented casualties among consumers according to
_Futureland_'s iOS 10 episode, which we did our absolute best to
dramatize in order to survive what was expected to be the dullest event
on record. We'd only that day been first made aware of Boomerang photos
and the mysterious nature of ‚ÄúLive Blogging‚Äù as an occupation.
https://www.theverge.com/2016/12/20/14016568/apple-airpods-wireless-earpods-earbuds-review[AirPods
were introduced] and subsequently shit on, and the
https://bilge.world/mono-audio-playback[comparatively archaic] 3.5mm
analog audio jack was confidently parted with, finally. At least I got
over ‚Äúforgetting‚Äù about Live Photos because it's rapidly becoming
difficult to keep stuff _on_ the phone now. _I_ am coming sincerely
close to believing none of this is real, anyway. Today, though, it‚Äôs a
damned straight ballgame, isn‚Äôt it? Months have passed since Apple
pushed out its major mobile OS release of the year to
https://www.theverge.com/2016/1/26/10835748/apple-devices-active-1-billion-iphone-ipad-ios[more
little rectangular computers] than any one person could speedcount in a
lifetime and YouTube is already recommending me dozens of
https://youtu.be/CXKqCWWjxSM[videos about the next one]. At this point,
you and I are already aware of the iOS development community, who has
already been using Internet Operating System 12 on their personal
devices for more than half a year by the time your irises are landing
here. Hopefully, all but two or three stranded, dying explorers in the
arctic have updated their iPhones and iPads by now, and why wouldn‚Äôt
they?

Our expectations from this ritual are completely alien compared to those
we‚Äôd need to anticipate from the event 5 or 6 releases ago, when one‚Äôs
phone had to be sent away (in a sense) to latch itself tight to the
stability of a desktop-class product in order to undergo a lengthy,
destined metamorphosis. Sometimes, backups via 30-pin to USB-2.0 cables
took hours, after which the custodian may or may not find their
companion‚Äôs replication had completed successfully. If it had, one had
to be sure to close any applications apart from iTunes to provide a
working environment of utter silence ‚Äì restarting after finishing the
download was my own preferred method ‚Äì before entrusting the despicably
unreliable software to whittle away in a sometimes frantically
rebooting, feverish procedure with near life-threatening stigma: it
wasn‚Äôt uncommon for an update to inexplicably fail, ‚Äúbricking‚Äù the
subject iPhone and requiring that one take two whole steps in the wrong
direction and restore it from the entire backup they‚Äôd just created
(hopefully) in order to‚Ä¶ make another, precisely-identical attempt, for
lack of variables or alternatives to the process. However, if the user
planned sufficiently and made a point to begin the whole charade
immediately upon arriving home for the evening, these potential
frustrations could be compensated for, and odds would favor counting on
their smartphone to emerge safe and sound from the procedure just before
bed, when even those holding the second-newest product in the lineage
would have just enough screen time to notice that text entry, web page
loading, and window management had noticeably slowed before sighing and
tossing their device toward the darkness.

These days, one would need to try very hard to be inconvenienced by iOS
updates. My iPhone 8 Plus is two or three times more powerful than my
laptop at the moment, and my new friends‚Äô WiFi connection is better than
what the State government uses internally, back home. I haven‚Äôt needed
to physically back it up more than once or twice since I bought it ‚Äî
iCloud stores the lot for $4.99¬≠ a month anyway. I blinked once watching
_Riki-Oh_ with high school friends some time ago and all of the sudden,
a 1.6GB download isn‚Äôt really a big deal. Siddown and watch your
Instagram stories for twenty minutes, and _hey_! You‚Äôre ready to update!
Somehow, I have abruptly found myself in a reality in which *I am the
obvious bottleneck* and my 100 words per minute on a smartphone
keyboard, even, is no longer fast enough: my fucking phone is now
*waiting on me* when it updates. The keyholder is the whole goddamned
holdup.

So, what possible purpose could there be in pounding out this ‚ÄúReview‚Äù
of a free software update that‚Äôs in no way optional (waiting a month is
no longer a rational minimization of risk ‚Äî it‚Äôs just dumb,) not any
more difficult to attain than the bills currently waiting in your
mailbox, nor allowed by the nature of mobile operating systems to
compete with any cross-platform alternatives? For myself, it‚Äôs proved
http://bilge.world/ios-10-review-speed/[a gratifying tradition of sorts]
and a good use of my apparently-abundant time if only for the record's
sake (hello, future web archivists, neohuman and otherwise!,) but this
release ‚Äì assuming I haven‚Äôt overlooked something ‚Äì is the most
globe-shucking of all because of one single featureset: *Siri
Shortcuts*. However, the vast majority of the intra-Apple press'
coverage of this release has come across nearly as unconcerned with them
as I was originally. Take
https://www.macworld.co.uk/review/ios-apps/ios-12-3683670/[_Macworld_'s
iOS 12 Review], for instance: it was the first result in my Google
search for ‚ÄúiOS 12 review,‚Äù yet Siri Shortcuts are only mentioned in the
bottom quarter of its first page. When I recorded the
‚Äúhttps://radiopublic.com/end-user-WdbezM/ep/s1!ba096[iOS 12 Review]‚Äù
episode of my ‚Äúhttps://anchor.fm/davidblue[podcast],‚Äù I spoke as if I
was somehow the only person on the planet who comprehends the profound
implications of this software addition ‚Äì which was, of course, more of
https://techcrunch.com/2017/03/22/apple-has-acquired-workflow-a-powerful-automation-tool-for-ipad-and-iphone/[an
absorbent acquisition] ‚Äì but I have since discovered one gem, at least,
which has continued the conversation in a most superb manner. It's
https://supercomputer.transistor.fm/about[a technology podcast called
_Supercomputer_], and it's hosted by https://twitter.com/AlexCox[Alex
Cox] and https://twitter.com/AlexCox[Matthew Cassinelli] ‚Äì the latter of
whom developed a significant amount of the iOS app
https://techcrunch.com/2015/05/16/workflow-hints-at-the-future-of-the-watch-as-a-computing-platform/[Workflow]
(and wrote most or all of its documentation,
https://anchor.fm/davidblue[apparently],) which Apple assimilated as
Siri Shortcuts. Both are extremely knowledgeable and competent
commentators on ‚Äì as far as I can hear, at least ‚Äì virtually *the entire
iOS *lifestyle**. (For those on the outside who've never stepped in:
laugh if you must, but yes it _is_ a lifestyle, still, and it's new
thought leader
https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/3/18124416/tim-cook-apple-infowars-white-supremacy-podcasts-platform-adl[isn't
exactly coming up short] these days.) iOS is technically _software_,
yes, but it leaves an intractable itch for some greater, transcendent
term.

https://youtube.com/watch?v=pxtA9n2XwAM

In just forty minutes, without any prior knowledge about this feature, I
was able to create a Shortcut which sends any given handset's IP address
and precise GPS location (among other mundane metrics) in a text message
*to my phone number*. I could share this shortcut among my other
submissions to https://sharecuts.app/[Sharecuts] or
https://shortcutsgallery.com/[ShortcutsGallery.com], where any iOS user
could download and subsequently send this information back to _my_
phone. (Don't believe me?
https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/2873cc28684646e1904f0e80c21c8481[Have a
go at it yourself] and I'll send back a screenshot if you'd like.) I
accomplished this without any particular skills or education in software
development or cybersecurity ‚Äì without any real _malice_, even ‚Äì I was
just playing around. As far as my recollection goes, Apple has _never_
included such a powerful, potentially-dangerous piece of software in a
standard software update before. It's both absolutely brilliant and
sortof a ripoff to be so entrusted for the first time. In many ways ‚Äì
like my Disable Bluetooth & WiFi shortcut ‚Äì Siri Shortcuts represent an
awfully half-assed solution to some of the most basic, longtime
incongruencies within iOS. Sure, it's great that I can just make myself
a shortcut to completely disable my phone's WiFi and Bluetooth activity
with one press or Siri command (combining ‚Äútype to Siri‚Äù with Siri
Shortcuts basically enables a form of Command Line functionality in
iOS,) but frankly, one should've expected the world's largest company to
_do it themselves_ in perhaps the second of third version of this
operating system instead of saying _okay, here are the tools ‚Äì you do
it!_ in its _twelfth_.

I've found it inevitable when speaking on iOS to avoid discussing the
_other_ literature available on the subject at any given time. The depth
to which technology media has assimilated the habits and mannerisms of a
single American company is absolutely mind-boggling, regardless of its
history, its market share, or even its recent trillion-dollar valuation.
Dozens of media companies ‚Äì _https://www.cultofmac.com/[CultofMac]_,
_https://www.macrumors.com/[MacRumors]_,
_https://www.macworld.com/[Macworld]_, _https://9to5mac.com/[9to5 Mac]_,
https://appleinsider.com/[_AppleInsider_],
_https://www.imore.com/[iMore]_, and... more ‚Äì exist solely to cover one
single independent company: *Apple, Incorporated*. One wonders how the
sum total of the individuals involved with and these organizations
compares with the total number of employees working for the company
their careers are (for the moment, at least,) entirely centered around.
(Further interesting questions: are there any comparable situations
anywhere else in Western capitalism, and if not ‚Äì doesn't this sort of
attention constitute _some kind_ of Monopoly, even if it was not
necessarily an anti-competitive one?) For ‚Äúreasonable people,‚Äù the image
one conjures up of _The All-The-Time Apple Beat_ does not lend to envy,
but let's choose to limit ourselves to only the most casual forms of
speculation. I do not wish to mock them, for I, too remember the
sensation of The Apple Drug from an unfortunate time in my childhood
development when I was willing to wear a cheap sweatshirt branded with a
stupid Mac vs. Windows Users joke unironically to a real live public
Junior High school. There are few more embarrassing admissions, except
perhaps admitting that a part of me genuinely yearns to return to this
level of enthusiasm, as misplaced and cringey as it was. It's the
addiction to the mystic; it's aspirational in its democratization.
_Billionaires_ are running the same operating system and much of the
same software as I am every day ‚Äì even the most followed person on any
given platform is still accessing it through the same interface I might
be. These are incredible truths, but they also reflect a dangerous lack
of competition in a product category that has become more essential to
day-to-day human life than any other in just three or four blinks of an
eye.

_Fuck David Blue_, though. Who are the _real_, _hard-hitting_ minds
who've kept this industry and this company in check? Well, it's funny
you should ask that, because the people's quirky _New York Times_ tech
critic of late ‚Äì the esteemed
https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/28/technology/how-to-survive-the-next-era-of-tech-slow-down-and-be-mindful.html[Farhad
Manjoo] ‚Äì has just
https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/28/technology/how-to-survive-the-next-era-of-tech-slow-down-and-be-mindful.html[concluded
a five-year-long technology column] with some essential (if perhaps a
bit unoriginal) advice: ‚Äú*just slow down*.‚Äù If you're still following
along, you shall surely enjoy clicking some of his links, and I would
certainly encourage that you do until you're out of free articles, at
least. When Manjoo speaks, Apple listens: his January decree for Apple
to bend with the industry wind and build
‚Äúhttps://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/17/technology/apple-addiction-iphone.html[a
Less Addictive iPhone]‚Äù is convincingly prophetic considering *Screen
Time* ‚Äì probably the most mulled-over iOS 12 addition. As someone who
was diagnosed with Attention Deficit Disorder (however much or little
that may mean to you) just one or two years after I began using my/the
first iPhone, I've developed a history of what he might call _Addiction_
to iPhones in variable oscillation
https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/1042825995546320896[touching both
extremes]. I carried my first-generation iPhone for almost 5 years ‚Äì as
you can imagine, it was far from a 100%-functional device toward the end
of that bell curve. In contrast, I've also stood in line at dawn for two
iPhone launches, jailbroken, listened to podcasts _only_ about apps (far
before they were good,) and been compelled to chronicle and reflect upon
all of it for as long as I can remember.

There's no denying that the iPhone has had a profound effect on my life
mostly thanks to my own choices, which is why it's worth telling the
vast majority of you that features like Screen Time will never help you
achieve whatever vague conception of _reduced usage_ you may have. If
you haven't yet quantified the figures you'll find within it in mental
estimates, you aren't really concerned at all and if you _have_, Screen
Time will only confirm them. Using reminder notifications to optimize
your appflow makes no attempt at all to actually escape the mentality of
the behavior you seek to lessen from yourself. Another app is still
another app; a notification reminding you to stop using an app does
nothing but add still more stimuli. If you want to stop using the phone
so much, **stop* using the fucking phone*. If you are truly concerned
about how your handset companion has changed your life, turn it off for
a week/month/quarter ‚Äì however long you _possibly_ can. By that, I mean
no more or less than what you can manage without getting
fired/dumped/expelled/etc. If you have _truly_ reached this point,
anything less is probably worth it. There is simply no other way to get
a clear picture of how it's changed you.

Google, Facebook, and the rest of the industry are well aware of this,
but know they can't _actually_ advocate against the fundamental
mechanism that drives their businesses, so they express concern by doing
what they know: *building more software*. Apple is in a slightly
different situation: they still need you to buy their phones ‚Äì and even
to look at them ‚Äì but not past the point of hurting yourself
emotionally, mentally, or physically because those injuries tend to hurt
one _economically_. Screen Time's purpose is to keep us thriving and
buying, but the only effective solve for this can only be communicated
in garbage cinema language: *you must find it within yourself*. I am
_actually_ the worst person from which to model your life, except
perhaps for my iPhone use: unless there's little else worthy of my
attention, my phone is not out. Even if checking my
mailto:davidblue@gmail.com[emails],
https://mastodon.social/@DavidBlue[Mastodon],
https://twitter.com/neoyokel[Twitter], etc. are my default tasks, there
are infinitely many besides that come first. Every once in a while, it's
okay to finish an important message while walking down the street or
waiting at a stoplight if things are urgent, but I can guarantee you
that my attention is better consolidated on traveling in 95% of cases ‚Äì
moving with purpose and then focusing on my composition _after_ I've
arrived is almost always more efficient. I realize that I'm cowboying it
here and sound like your Dad, but I'm better with iOS than he is, yet
I've never publicly run into anything while looking down at my
smartphone in 10 years of hardcore use. *Find somebody who's company
makes you forget about all of this for hours at a time and treasure
them*. Also: *stop playing games on your phone*. _What the hell are you
doing_? Read a blog! Explore the wonders of the open web! Your peers,
your battery, and your elderly future self with thank you for it. (One
exception is playing word/trivia games with your partner. That's very
cute and good for you.)

_I was elated to see that even Apple supports my
https://twitter.com/i/moments/996616971880882176[age-old cause for
Twitter Lists]. Also, the new function in Apple Music allowing the user
to search by lyrics
https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/1042825995546320896[appears to work
very well]..._

To get back to specifics, the *new Photos application* is now basically
what it should have been all along,
https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/9/24/17896228/ios-12-keyboard-trackpad-cursor-3d-touch-iphone-ipad[3D
Touch has been virtually eclipsed] for those strange bastards among you
who never liked it, and the release's most democratically-redeemable
feature is *optimization*, which even on my iPhone 8 Plus was blatantly
noticeable and very welcome. However, probably the best insight to come
out of my long, rambly _End User_ review was the revelation that
basically any other human activity is a better use of time than
https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/17/17862236/ios-12-review-download-features-update-speed-iphone-ipad-screen-time-notifications-siri[applauding
Apple] for learning to hold new features off until they've been
thoroughly tested and focusing instead on smoothing existing software.
In fact, I'd argue there is absolutely no reason for someone like me to
say anything even remotely positive about the world's wealthiest company
ever again, though that doesn't apply to _The Verge_ or Chaim
Gartenberg, who's review ‚Äì for the record ‚Äì was much more useful to 9999
times more people than anything I'll ever write. However, isn't it
sortof unreasonable to expect anything but _absolute perfection_ from
Apple at this trillion-dollar juncture? A handful of varying
interpretations of absolute perfection per product category, even.

With gorgeous, iCloud-enabled premium apps like
https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/1063486573197561857[Bear] in the
picture, integrating wholly into the Apple environment has maintained
its relative rank above the alternatives to its specific minimal-esque
utilitarian _niceness_ which appeals so strongly to _those people_ among
both consumer and professional buyers. Readers from within this culture
recognized a short time ago that
https://www.wired.co.uk/article/ipad-pro-2018-review[iOS is in the
process of replacing MacOS] as the star component of this environment
across the board, though there's at least a moderate journey ahead
before it truly reaches this achievement for the median user. For
myself, iOS 12 improved the experience of using my 8 Plus and certainly
gave me something intriguing to play with in Siri Shortcuts. For the
rest of the world's billions of daily iOS users, I say _be as insatiable
as possible_ ‚Äì always expect more.

Ethicist, author of _Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs_, and longtime men's
interest media-affiliated sports and music columnist Chuck Klosterman
pronounces his surname _kloa-ster-men_ instead of _klaw-ster-men_ as _I_
have been, shamefully ‚Äì even within earshot of other human beings on a
handful of occasions. I am willing to submit myself for punishment for
these transgressions under the single condition that I be allowed to
call him _Cuck Klusterfuck_ the next time he ends a spoken sentence with
‚Äúor whatever‚Äù in an interview ‚Äì an unfortunate habit he's
https://youtu.be/NMzPX-MERbU[maintained for years]. If my own byline had
any pedigree in the world of literary criticism, I would now collect his
penance simply by including those hateful, 90s stoner-kid buzzwords in
every quote, unedited, but it most certainly does not. I've searched
moderately hard for any reason to bother contributing any criticism of
books or their authors and returned with very little. I've read _The
Broom of the System_ and _White Girls_ this year, yes, but I'd have to
be a http://www.revelist.com/books/books-fuckboys-read/3289[Fuck Boy] to
write anything about David Foster Wallace, and
https://www.interviewmagazine.com/culture/hilton-als-white-girls[Hilton

societal rights and perceptive capacity that I wouldn't dare utter a
single editorialized peep about it ‚Äì aside from a log line-length
recommendation ‚Äì even under immediate threat of certain death.

Given my recent https://www.instagram.com/p/BhArAZNF6W7/[voluntary
relocation to Portland, Oregon] and the word-y pursuits on which I
choose to spend all of my money and energy, I should adore everything
about Chuck Klosterman and in turn he should be completely invisible
across the under-30 demographic, yet I‚Äôve found a special originality in
his voice since first exploring it and I think it might be worth
requalification. A good friend of mine once dug his

novel]
https://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/04/books/review/Meehan-t.html[_Downtown
Owl_] out of a bulk box of bargain books she‚Äôd bought as a preteen, long
ago and became an enthusiastic fan of his perspective and a harsh, but
fond critic of his persona. It was her copy of his second that I read
first:
https://www.npr.org/2011/10/04/141015210/visible-man-asks-what-if-no-one-were-watching[_The
Visible Man_] ‚Äì ultimately a surprisingly-original take on the
_psychologist of a gifted outcast_ tale that classically exemplifies the
easy-to-digest yet thoughtfully-exploratory reputation of his craft.
Thanks to her library card, I was able to follow it up immediately with
Chuck‚Äôs latest, most topical work ‚Äì an anthology of past essays written
for publications like _The Guardian_, _Grantland_, and _GQ_ entitled _X:
A Highly Specific, Defiantly Incomplete History of the Early 21st
Century_, which proved an impossibly entertaining, even more polished
execution of The Quaint Chuck‚Äôs Explanations in non-fiction form,
beginning at onset with refreshing brevity in its

technical infractions against convention laid down in _X_‚Äôs arrangement
which proves to act toward the benefit of its experience. If you
substitute _car nerds_ for _sportswriters_, I‚Äôd personally identify with
this picoautobiography in a big way, but more importantly as a _reader_
I had never encountered anything written about sports which I would
describe as _pretentious_, per se, and that realization could very well
have birthed enough curiosity to land the sale, had I been skimming in a
bookshop, which I would‚Äôve eventually been pleased with.

Now, during what we should hope to be the first dawn of a new microera
of sincerity, we must recognize how valuable it is for Klosterman as an
observer to be comfortably engaged with his subjects, emotionally, and
confident in the value of his commentary in middleage without the need
to insist upon his eccentricity, as so many cringey, culturally-daft
Dads do, these days. He uses keywords in his writing and spoken
publicity that _should_ dismiss him immediately as one of these ‚Äì a
nostalgic, out-of-time dork ‚Äì but are instead somehow magically
manipulated to _serve_ him in articulating reasonable, even
profoundly-innovative insight. As I have explored his bibliography and
his publicly-expressed thoughts, I have been caught up and hinged on a
single supposition: *Chuck Klosterman is the only white, 46-year-old
bearded Portland Dad you should be reading*. Do mind that I am in no way
exempt from this lens, but it‚Äôs still my job to determine his viability
as an intellectual ‚Äì a ‚Äúthought leader,‚Äù even ‚Äì for those of us who were
conceived around the same time he was wrapping up his collegiate
sentence at the University of North Dakota.

For a solid hunk of the American reading audience, a quick, elemental
vector of quality and mastery we look for in an essayist is the ability
to ‚Äútranscend‚Äù their subject matter for even the most presumptuous and
conceited among us, usually to deliver a more abstract sentiment to
leave with. Here, Klosterman‚Äôs significant career experience is
irrefutably evident ‚Äì in _X_, he achieves this transcendence organically
with a fluidity unlike anything I‚Äôve read before. We can already check a
single box: convincing even a young professional twenty-something to
shell out for a physical hardback of contemporary non-fiction requiring
any sort of academic effort to consume is going to be nigh-impossible,
even though _X_ actually happens to be the best-looking specimen of
print product design I have ever handled across cover, type, and layout.
It‚Äôs been difficult having to convince myself to give this copy back.

In the interest of full disclosure, I must take special care to
emphasize just how highly I regard Peter Kafka as editor and interviewer
extraordinaire within the Media beat ‚Äì well-proven to be capable of
hitting consistently hard on both

unimpeachable] stone-faced skepticism. However, this Chuck Klosterman
interview for _Recode Media_ is an uncharacteristically disarmed display
of serious admiration: he introduces _X_ with an outright confession:
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs great. I bought it. I bought a signed copy,‚Äù which is an
unexpected oddity (though not an unwelcome one ‚Äì I‚Äôm glad Peter enjoys
his life.) Their conversation dips briefly in personal history (Chuck
and his wife moved to Portland from Brooklyn for its proximity to
family) before plopping down upon the substance of his clearly superb
and matter-of-fact interview technique. I‚Äôm not sure I‚Äôve ever heard a
conversation between Kafka and any previous guests with whom he was
quite so obviously alike in general disposition.

____
The only reason I‚Äôm able to ask you these questions is because I‚Äôm a
reporter and I can ask you questions now that I probably wouldn‚Äôt feel
comfortable asking you if we were friends, so I‚Äôm not going to pretend
that we are and I‚Äôm not going to create some fake thing where we‚Äôre
going to have a relationship beyond this conversation. I‚Äôm just going to
ask you the things I want to know about and I hope that you respect the
fact that I‚Äôm just being straight with you. I find that that works much
better.
____

From the broadest possible pop cultural lens, Chuck's most spectacular
and widely-circulated work, demographically (I assume) is his
https://www.gq.com/story/taylor-swift-gq-cover-story[2015 interview and
cover story] for _GQ_ with Taylor Swift ‚Äì then ‚Äúthe most popular human
alive.‚Äù Yes, it really _is_ worth dwelling on the image: *_this guy_*...
this very Dorky Dad, just hanging out with the most highly-demanded teen
idol who's ever lived, sitting awkwardly next to her in the backseat of
her car as she maniacally panics to accept a call from Justin
Timberlake. When one Chucks such a distinguished contrast upon such a
high-profile contemporary medium, the weight of the potential scrutiny
becomes palpable, but Klosterman anticipates and braces for this (very
risky) business in the only manner he can: acknowledging it over and
over and _over_ again in the second paragraph of his every interview
appearance.

____
It doesn‚Äôt matter if it was complimentary or insulting necessarily. It
would seem as though I wasn‚Äôt taking her seriously as a musical artist,
and the idea is that I do. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm writing about her is because I
do think she‚Äôs a meaningful, significant artist. It‚Äôs not worth the risk
of having the story then get shifted by other people who perhaps just
perceive themselves as somebody who‚Äôs a watchdog for certain signifiers
or certain elements of the culture and that their job is to be on the
watch for this. If your story then gets moved into that silo, that‚Äôs all
it‚Äôs going to be remembered for... It‚Äôs a touchier thing now. It‚Äôs a
more dangerous thing.
____

In the http://bit.ly/ckswiftpreface[print itself], the cover story is
prefaced by a very short but uncomfortably-telling complaint about
changing expectations for culture writers. One might reasonably suggest
that Klosterman regards the practice of calling out or remarking on
‚Äúcreepy misogyny‚Äù as ‚Äúdumb‚Äù ‚Äì nothing but the byproduct of changing
‚Äútimes.‚Äù

____
Something you may notice in the following 2015 feature on Taylor Swift
is that I never describe what she looks like or how she was dressed,
even though I almost always do that with any celebrity I cover... If I
did, it would be reframed as creepy misogyny and proof that I didn't
take the woman seriously as an artist. It would derail everything else
about the story. It would *become* the story.
____

But‚Ä¶ _is it_? Note how desperately close his language comes to the
_common white guy whining about feminism_ classification without
_actually_ fitting the bill. Right‚Ä¶? It _doesn‚Äôt_? Surely, it must be
certified Awake through some combination of keywords or format I‚Äôm
unfamiliar with or unable to visually register because Klosterman‚Äôs ass
would have long been grass, otherwise. These 224 words are _X_‚Äôs most
contentious, which you could call impressive, all things considered ‚Äì he
appears to care enough about his public image to curate it somewhat
diligently. When a motherhood blogger published
https://atypicalson.com/2013/11/07/an-open-letter-to-chuck-klosterman-the-new-york-times-ethicist/[an
open letter] in 2013 citing three very ableist uses of the R-word in his
work, it only took him two days to
https://www.huffingtonpost.com/kari-wagnerpeck/i-am-the-author-of-the-op_b_4319577.html[respond]:
‚ÄúI was wrong. You are right.‚Äù

More than any other writer of his demographic, *Chuck Klosterman has a
close, wary relationship with the everchanging contextual boundaries of
public expression*. He knows when to be transparent with his feelings on
progression, and he's careful to avoid what could be ‚Äúproblematic‚Äù for
the sake of functioning better as a writer (I assume.) For _Slate_'s _I
Have to Ask_ podcast, he managed to
https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2018/02/chuck-klosterman-on-how-the-approach-to-cultural-criticism-has-completely-flipped.html[speak
extensively] about these mechanisms for nearly an hour without bellowing
anything definitively cringey.

____
I can‚Äôt say it‚Äôs better or worse. It‚Äôs just different, and because it‚Äôs
different, it makes me feel uncomfortable, but there‚Äôs actually like an
adversarial relationship with the history of anything, and that somehow
that history is seen as oppressive. And you shouldn‚Äôt even know about
it. It‚Äôs better to live in now.
____

A quick jaunt from pretty horrendous to almost-ideal, then. If we are to
place our faith in Chuck as our last bearded champion, we must hope that
last sentence is sincerely intended to be his lens to the changing
world. Granted ‚Äì even if it _is_ the truth ‚Äì it‚Äôs not as if persistent
acknowledgement of one‚Äôs position can miraculously wash away any
systematic patriarchal dynamics involved in authoring (or reading, for
that matter) a high-profile feature of a young woman on cover of a
magazine which explicitly seeks most to speak to
‚Äúhttp://www.condenast.com/brands/gq/[all sides of the male equation],‚Äù
(are you _sure about_ _that_, Cond√© Nast?) especially considering how
unlikely it would've been for me to read anything about Taylor Swift
outside of this very white man's anthology. Fundamental themes of power
and control are threaded throughout both his fiction and non-fiction,
which is especially prevalent in the Macho Big Boy cultures of the
athletics and music industries. In profiling Taylor Swift ‚Äì the
undisputed apex of the latter in 2015 ‚Äì Klosterman provided a firsthand
account of the grueling maintenance of a public and private personality
under tremendous strain from said factors as they were magnified to the
max by the most extreme celebrity.

____
Here we see Swift‚Äôs circuitous dilemma: Any attempt to appear less
calculating scans as even more calculated. Because Swift‚Äôs professional
career has unspooled with such precision, it‚Äôs assumed that her social
life is no less premeditated.
____

I‚Äôm right there with Chuck: I‚Äôve even found a fundamental pillar in
Power and Control relationships supporting my own fiction experiments:
*how we attain them*, *how we lose them*, and *how best to make use of
them* ‚Äì all of which had apparently been quite problematic for Taylor
Swift for most of her adult life, though we wouldn‚Äôt be allowed to
_really_ comprehend how deep her inner turmoil had drilled until it
overwhelmed even her expertly-designed self-control four years later,
https://youtu.be/3tmd-ClpJxA[boiling over entirely] with such unexpected
violence that all of America‚Äôs pseudorural
glam-pop-country-glossy-chode-hipsters let out a simultaneous,
dangerously-alarmed holler of _OH FOR PETE‚ÄôS SAKE_ that was actually
heard and recorded from the overflying orbit of the International Space
Station.

____
It‚Äôs somehow different when the hub of the wheel is Swift. People get
skeptical. Her famous friends are marginalized as acquisitions, selected
to occupy specific roles, almost like members of the Justice League
('the ectomorph model,' 'the inventive indie artist,' 'the informed
third-wave feminist,' etc.). Such perceptions perplex Swift, who is
genuinely obsessed with these attachments.
____

No, it‚Äôs not _only_ worthwhile as an exercise in superbly athletic
self-awareness ‚Äì the Taylor profile is profound. I‚Äôd recommend reading
and treasuring it with or without the rest of the anthology because
bizarre intersections like these are rare to come by from anybody else.
Short, sharp, and occasionally somewhat petty notions are what Chuck
Klosterman does best and most originally. Thanks to a digression of
Kafka‚Äôs beginning with ‚Äúyou and I are about the same age‚Ä¶,‚Äù he arrives
(by way of REM, believe it or not) at a significant statement about
youth and identity.

____
It seems strange to me to be into music for its coolness outside of high
school. That seems like that‚Äôs the only time when you‚Äôre a young person
and you‚Äôre using art basically to create a personality because you don‚Äôt
have a real personality yet.
____

Klosterman is debatably exempt from the traditional academic abstract of
‚Äúobjectivity‚Äù for the vast majority of his notable work because of its
stated primary subject: his ‚Äúinterior life.‚Äù Perhaps the success of his
voice could be at least partially attributed to his development of an
existential muscle ‚Äì a perspective unique enough to entertain, yet no
less recognizably Midwestern with which he‚Äôs been able to reflect
particularly clearly on the profession in tandem with the experience
he‚Äôs accumulated over the course of his career.

____
You know, when you‚Äôre young, you‚Äôre a real emotional writer if you‚Äôre a
writer‚Ä¶ If I was a young person now, I would be incredibly attracted to
the idea that when you‚Äôre 22 you can be a national writer, which was
impossible when I was 22.
____

In a way, Klosterman does surmise that it _was_ indeed its objectivity
that media lost, and that writing is no longer a ‚Äúone-way relationship,‚Äù
but a sort of ridiculous dance in which ‚Äúmany people feel the reason
they‚Äôre consuming media is to respond to it‚Ä¶ that it‚Äôs not for the
content.‚Äù I would remind old Chuck that there are very few functioning
adults outside of academia or retirement in the United States who spend
much of their time reading anything solely for the sake of absorption,
and the disparity between those who were and weren‚Äôt was exponentially
greater in the past. The story of American media is defined by its
cycles of waning and waxing democratization, but many of the more
traditional avenues in the business have bet on the ‚Äútwo-way
relationship‚Äù to keep them relevant.

My own favorite chapter of the collection is a
http://grantland.com/features/space-time-dvr-mechanics/[2500-word
personal essay] constructed for _Grantland_ to answer a single
incongruity: ‚Äú*Why is watching a prerecorded sporting event less
pleasurable than watching the same game live*?‚Äù Some form of this
question has at least mildly troubled every American since the 1960s,
including myself, and Klosterman manages to provide an entertaining and
concise analysis of this plight through his own wisdom. In its
http://bit.ly/ckdepressed[short preface] in the volume ‚Äì which was
written ‚Äúin 2008, in Europe, when [Chuck] was pretend depressed‚Äù is the
story of his encounter with a house-painting stranger, to whom he
explains the meter for success in his opinion-manufacturing profession,
as he sees it: ‚ÄúIf a large number of strangers seem to think one of my
opinions is especially true or wildly wrong, there is somehow a
perception that I am succeeding at this vocation.‚Äù

____
Last weekend I was in a hashish bar in Amsterdam. It was post-dusk,
pre-night. The music was terrible (fake reggae, late-period Eric
Clapton, Sublime deep cuts.) I was sitting next to a British stranger
with a shaved head and a speech impediment. Our conversation required
subtitles, so I imagined them in my mind. He told me he had lost three
family members within the past year: his mother, who was sixty-six; his
uncle, who was fifty-six; and his sister, who was forty-six. He said
he'd just turned thirty-six. He asked if I saw a pattern developing.
‚ÄúYes,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúBut only numerically.‚Äù I asked what he did for a living.
He said he was a housepainter. He asked me the same question about
myself. ‚ÄúI manufacture opinions,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúReally?‚Äù he asked. ‚ÄúHow do
you know if you‚Äôre any good at that?‚Äù ‚ÄúBy the number of people who agree
or disagree,‚Äù I said in response. ‚ÄúIf a large number of strangers seem
to think one of my opinions is especially true or wildly wrong, there is
somehow a perception that I am succeeding at this vocation.‚Äù ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs
interesting,‚Äù said the bald British man who could barely speak. ‚ÄúI guess
house painting is a totally different thing.‚Äù
____

Rarely are situations or discussions that begin with _back in my day_
actually constructive in any sense, but Chuck Klosterman appears to be
the exception. If you‚Äôre willing to indulge him, you may find yourself
reassured. He now writes from a remote cabin (with WiFi,) was tortured ‚Äì
like all of us ‚Äì in sifting through and compiling his old work for _X_,
and finds its index to be his favorite part.

____
Exploring the index from a book you created is like having someone split
your head open with an axe so that you can peruse the contents of your
brain.
____

He is
https://www.esquire.com/entertainment/a3556/klosterman1107[willfully and

a confident, fascinating technique of which any other music or culture
writer would deprive you. He is ‚Äúalmost embarrassed‚Äù by his
http://bit.ly/exrfastnet[emotional attachment] to the Charlie Brown
peanuts. (See:
https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/Chuck-Klosterman-on-Charlie-Brown-7jHNnij3saNFwtHt9Nika[Chuck
Klosterman on Charlie Brown].)

____
I haven't watched A Charlie Brown Christmas in at least twenty-five
years, solely because I can't emotionally reconcile the final scene.
____

You‚Äôll notice that his entire answer to the live television debacle is ‚Äì
again ‚Äì entirely about control (or the lack thereof.) In fact, his
relationship with and desire for control also contributed to his choice
of profession.

____
Part of the reason I became a writer is because it was this completely
controlled reality where I could do this thing by myself where you‚Äôd go
out and you‚Äôd do the interviews and stuff, but then you‚Äôre back by
yourself, transcribing and then writing. Then, when the story is done
and you send it off, that‚Äôs the end. Now that‚Äôs the middle. Now it‚Äôs
like, when the story is published, it‚Äôs the middle of the process very
often because the consumer feels differently now.
____

While Klosterman‚Äôs voice is pleasant to someone like me, neither it nor
himself necessarily belong to The People. In his

review for _Paste Magazine_], B. David Zarley proclaims essays to be ‚Äúa

another writer who could make a 30-page, deeply reported essay about a
North Dakota junior-college basketball game interesting,‚Äù suggesting
that this new collection marks Klosterman‚Äôs ascendance from *critic* to
*philosopher*. From what I‚Äôve read to date, I would counter that he has
always fulfilled the term to the extent of its usefulness in the 21st
century and is even now beginning to redefine it. Last January, he
braved the ‚Äúdystopic‚Äù Google Gates to https://youtu.be/HhGA9e-OiFY[speak

over the entire culture,‚Äù and urging caution and reflection in the

with them ‚Äì especially during https://youtu.be/HhGA9e-OiFY?t=36m35s[the
Q&A] ‚Äì is a fascinating insight into the Greater Google Mind, and I
would encourage any invested parties in Chuck Klosterman‚Äôs role as a
philosopher to watch the talk in full. I was unfamiliar with ‚Äúthe
boat-sails-wind analogy‚Äù before I read
https://www.theguardian.com/music/2010/apr/24/lcd-soundsystem-this-is-happening[James
Murphy‚Äôs interview] for LCD Soundsystem‚Äôs ‚Äúlast album.‚Äù

____
Your life is a boat, the sails are your emotions, and drugs are the
wind. When you're a kid, your boat is small and your sail is huge, and
drugs are like a hurricane.
____

*Control x Time = the Klosterman beat*. I suppose this must be what
other entertainment writers are referring to when they
http://www.dallasobserver.com/arts/pop-culture-critic-chuck-klosterman-talks-about-his-new-essay-collection-x-9559383[accuse
Chuck of nostalgia trafficking], but I can‚Äôt be so sure. Though I‚Äôd like
to think my own snout for the stuff is especially well-tuned, I am
undeniably from a different planet ‚Äì even auditorily. All but one or two
of the musicians interviewed throughout _X_ were entirely unknown to me
by name, which Klosterman‚Äôs voice managed to make even more compelling ‚Äì
_not to mention_ the included stories of athletes and the sports
industry, which include stories of the human ego, paranoia, and complex
drama that always manage to transcend their setting when articulated
with such dexterity.

I‚Äôve never before written a book review of any sort ‚Äì nor am I
defensibly qualified to compare culture writers ‚Äì but with good ole‚Äô
Chuck, I dove much further in order to tackle one very important
question: *should Klosterman be recommended reading for anyone under 30*
above or alongside bestsellers like George Saunders or groundbreaking
essayists of color like Hilton Als? In many a case, I must conclude by
saying, simply, that _something_ of value would be forgone if we shunned
Chuck, even if his insight is old news to all but the most rudimentary
yokels. I have little to offer women or people of color, but I‚Äôd bet _X_
would prove itself worth a library trip for any idiot white guys in
their lives who may be falling far behind. I don‚Äôt know of any other
voices who are in a better position to introduce these issues, nor any
who are quite so practiced at handling them delicately. While Jenna
Wortham-level readers will gain little to nothing from this examination
or the ecology of its subject (and will likely find themselves pausing
momentarily for a deserved jest before moving on and returning to their
high-level plane of complex neoliberal commentary,) but most of their
less-aWoken fathers should find in Chuck a man they can truly trust, who
manages to consistently distill and articulate the need-to-knows of the
most complex pop culture and pop science conversations without using any
of the academic language found in most institutional discourse which
daddy finds too condescending and superfluous to bear. Those readers
who‚Äôve absolutely fucking _despised_ my voice so far in this essay
should give Klosterman a go ‚Äì I take as much time as I can muster to
fiddle with and season the words in context like this work because *I
basically *enjoy* the bullshit*, yet I‚Äôve found both _X_ and _But What
If We‚Äôre Wrong?_ remarkably refreshing and impressive exercises.

____
[These are] the cultural conditions in which I was raised under and
which I pursued journalism under. That was part of the thing that drew
me to the idea of being a reporter was I was like, this is something I
can do, I think. My ability to detach my personal emotions from what I
am investigating, while not perfect, I can do this. And now it turns out
that the opposite is what‚Äôs desirable. I think it‚Äôs really going to
change the kind of person who goes into media going forward.
____

Reading Chuck Klosterman is going to be perturbing, but true sincerity
is almost always uncomfortable. Comprehensively, his nonfiction
represents perhaps the most important possible behavior to encourage
from both the critic and his readership because it incubates and exudes
*sincere curiosity* and a *genuine interest in learning to listen*. From
the perspective of quantified societal contribution, I‚Äôd argue that
Klosterman‚Äôs craft is a significantly more honorable and worthwhile
pursuit than greater academic literature in its unique and entertaining
treatment of subjects the establishment tends to pulverize into minutia.
Unless he‚Äôs broke and/or bookish, buy _X_ as a gift for your Dad and at
least give it a try when he‚Äôs done. If nothing else, _at least_ *read
the Taylor Swift interview*, okay? If he doesn‚Äôt enjoy the book, I‚Äôm
always available if one or both of you need to blow off some steam:
*give me a call at (573) 823-4380*. (_Normal text messaging / talktime
rates will apply_.)

Assuming Jesus Christ is in your thoughts this evening before yet
another anniversary of his birth, I am infinitely astonished by the
truth in what I‚Äôm about to suppose with you. If the Son of God was
living today, most of us have agreed for a long time now that he‚Äôd use
marijuana recreationally ‚Äì big fuckin whoop. I think it‚Äôs far more
interesting and appropriate (we all know his birthday was
https://www.thisamericanlife.org/47/christmas-and-commerce[wholly
reconfigured into a consumerist holiday] long ago) to speculate on how
he‚Äôd behave after finding himself inadvertently in the market for a new
laptop within the ~$1000 range (following a _stubbed toe whilst walking
on water_ incident, perhaps.) Surely, it would not be entirely holy for
him to opt in to the Foxconn-complicit world of Apple, Incorporated, nor
the
https://bilge.world/google-soul-ledger-dont-be-evil[openly-blasphemous]
one created and exuberantly grown by Google LLC, and I‚Äôm afraid he‚Äôd be
too much of an _End User_ idiot to integrate any of the sparse
Linux-dedicated hardware available. In May of 2017, however, Billy
Gates‚Äô old Microsoft finally released
‚Äúhttps://www.theverge.com/2017/5/5/15557738/vergecast-podcast-255-microsoft-surface-laptop-samsung-dex-i-clicked-the-doc[the
laptop we‚Äôve always wanted them to make],‚Äù but could its recent update
be truly worthy of our Lourde and Saviour? Or your newly-enrolled
offspring? Should you sprint downstairs and swap out the new MacBook Air
you just bought?

From an entirely valid perspective, an observer might declare my last
two months of 2018 to be an outright shameful period defined by
hypocrisy and traitorous betrayals. After finally taking the time to
explore the full narrative surrounding Linux and the bloody tale of
Microsoft‚Äôs cruel genocidal destruction of countless creative software
projects throughout computing‚Äôs adolescence (see:
‚Äúhttps://youtu.be/TVHcdgrqbHE?t=425[Embrace, Extend, Extinguish],‚Äù) I
eventually declared myself ‚Äú100% Open Source‚Äù and began outlining an
essay designed primarily to express that _Linux is finally ready to be
the operating system of the people_ without succumbing immediately to
the brand of cybercrackpot illegitimacy associated with the L-word in
the minds of the general public so readily thanks to decades of
misinformed, condescending neckbeards. Such a feat would require entire
new planes of cultural awareness and dialectal delicacy, yet certainly
result in zero personal reward from even the best possible outcome, yet
I proceeded to ponder the subject very deliberately all the way through
October because I genuinely believed in a new democratized future of
computing. 2018 had been my Grand Awakening to the idyllic possibilities
of Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) across the whole applied
spectrum from office suites to http://bilge.world/federated/[social
networks], yet ‚Äì as two thousand eighteen comes to an end ‚Äì I‚Äôve managed
to find myself among the most https://youtu.be/O0RSeFcv3Qs[jaded,
soul-sapped] tech community I have yet encountered: *Microsoft
Administrators*.

Complimenting this Linux-laden culture in which I was not so long ago
deeply embedded was a confused and frustrated outlook regarding what I
felt were excessive and completely idiotic sacrifices across the
industry‚Äôs hardware design to the greedy, gluttonous god of Lightness.
It seemed only reasonable to Myself As Consumer that the entire buying
public should exclusively seek designs prioritizing greatest possible
performance and battery life, even from portable computers and
smartphones, so I assumed my perspective on this updated iteration of
Microsoft's most laptopy Surface laptop ‚Äì which exists in large part to
https://www.pcmag.com/news/364728/spec-down-apple-macbook-air-vs-microsoft-surface-laptop-2[compete
directly with] Apple's beloved (and just-updated) MacBook Air ‚Äì wouldn't
be at all useful. However, a few weeks ago, my employer prompted me with
a sweet sweet ultimatum: _for the sake of a tax break, I want to spend
~$1000 on a laptop for you as soon as possible_. Yes, I know I should
consider myself a very fortunate man ‚Äì this
https://bilge.world/hp-spectre-x360-review[wasn't even the first time]
I'd been surprised with the ‚Äúhey, I want to buy you a laptop but it has
to be today‚Äù experience, and may even be considered a sort of sequel to
my _Tales of Whirlwind Manic Consumerism_, but it‚Äôs ultimately one of
the most idiotic strategies to achieve a major purchase decision and
completely inadvisable for anyone on a budget. Still I was indeed
thankful to be put in a nearly-identical situation of Consumer
Electronic haste, and have come to be especially appreciative of the
specific time I was approached as such: just one week after
https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/16/17979516/microsoft-surface-laptop-2-review-specs-price-features-windows-10[Microsoft
launched the Surface Laptop 2].

Considering the vast majority of its users are
https://theoutline.com/post/2923/the-popularity-of-microsoft-surface-is-the-least-realistic-thing-on-television[trapped
inside my television], there‚Äôs no harm in covering the Surface brand
with our virtual palm for a moment. If you‚Äôll indulge me so, you‚Äôll
notice that Microsoft has actually delivered unto us *The Laptop II* ‚Äì
as in, the sequel... the _successor_ to _every other laptop computer_
yet conceived... but does this one machine truly represent the second
coming of the _Notebook Christ_? Naturally, it would be a bit zealous to
stand behind this extreme statement with 100% sincerity, but there truly
_are_ certain elements of this Personal Computing product's execution
which do indeed will its user to expect and/or desire from others in
coming years. As I've stated before, I also simply cannot help but be
jazzed by such bravado from the mouths of even a company with as crooked
and hateful history as Microsoft's. (Note: no other technology company
has actually achieved what Microsoft historically has in this regard,
and hopefully none ever will again.)

I must be honest: it hasn't yet been two months and I've already scuffed
and perhaps even _stained_ the beautiful maroon alcantara surrounding my
machine‚Äôs touchable body, but it‚Äôs occurred to me that I might draw upon
the vast library of https://youtu.be/PM-FbFIBoCs[automotive interior
tutorials] available on YouTube ‚Äì and even purchase some of the
alcantara care-specific products they recommend ‚Äì in order to _really_
maintain the exterior of the Laptop II. After all,
https://www.popularmechanics.com/cars/a9653/what-is-alcantara/[alcantara
was undeniably car culture‚Äôs material first]. I should also confess that
objectively, the Surface Laptop II is the best-suited computer for _my
personal uses_ that I‚Äôve ever owned _or_ used for any length of time.
Subjectively, I don‚Äôt think all of the hardware design touches that make
it so ‚Äì like its keyboard layout, divine 3:2 aspect ratio, and
particular I/O complement ‚Äì have yet had the chance to seduce my
emotional brain into truly _loving_ it as much as I certainly should by
any reasonable measure. For my own sake, I hope I‚Äôm able to fall in
child-like infatuation with its magic, but in the interim, I believe the
coldness of my heart should hopefully preserve any useful commentary I
might have to add. Though this is undoubtedly the most timely review of
a hardware product I‚Äôve ever published, I‚Äôd still ask that you indulge
my perspective suggesting the importance of considering it part of a
_package_ with its operating system, considering that the whole of tech
media would‚Äôve unanimously declared it the year‚Äôs
‚Äúhttps://mashable.com/review/microsoft-surface-laptop-2/[best laptop]‚Äù
were Apple‚Äôs aging, but still widely-adored MacOS absent from the frame.

____
I've tested a bunch of laptops this year, running the spectrum of
2-in-1s, Chromebooks, MacBooks, gaming laptops, etc. Everyone's needs
are going to be different, which is why there's no such thing as a
one-size-fits-all for laptops. But enthusiasts‚Äô laptops aside, I
strongly feel the Surface Laptop 2 is the best laptop of the year. And
by that I mean the best laptop for most folks' needs.
____

With as much humility as possible, I must add that I myself am
_anything_ but ‚Äúmost folks,‚Äù yet my experience so far with the product
has been one of astonishing compatibility and battery life. Using
recommended power settings, the Surface Laptop 2 endured
https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/1080514545062477825[*four hours and
twenty-two minutes*] of a workload it wasn‚Äôt particularly designed for
including heavy web browsing, image manipulation, brief audio/video
capture with OBS, and moderate subsequent editing in Audacity and
OpenShot. Dan Seifert ‚Äì Vox Media‚Äôs
‚Äúhttps://www.recode.net/2017/5/12/15628228/microsoft-surface-laptop-apple-macbook-air-windows-10s-dan-seifert-recode-podcast[only
Windows user]‚Äù ‚Äì reported ‚Äúabout seven hours‚Äù of Microsoft‚Äôs claimed
14.5, but frankly, I don‚Äôt know what any of y‚Äôall are doin ‚Äì I‚Äôm just
thankful this machine is a better marathoner than any other I can recall
owning. While we‚Äôre on the subject, I consider Microsoft‚Äôs inclusion of
a magnetically-attached power cable and unassuming auxiliary USB
charging port on the attached power supply to be personal godsends ‚Äì
further evidence, even, that the Surface Laptop 2 was _actually designed
to be nice to use_. For the sake of those readers *actually in the
market for a new laptop* who‚Äôve somehow found themselves here, though,
Raymond Wong‚Äôs review for _Mashable_ is the most thorough offering
you‚Äôll find ‚Äì it‚Äôs quoted front and center on
https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/surface-laptop-2/8XQJKK3DD91B[Microsoft‚Äôs
web page for the Laptop II], even ‚Äì but it‚Äôs important to mention that
his critical comparative perspective predates the late launch of its
ultimate competitor, https://mashable.com/review/apple-macbook-air/[the
new MacBook Air]. Rather pitifully, however, his colleague‚Äôs ‚Äúgood, but
not great‚Äù resolution suggests that Apple failed to challenge
Microsoft‚Äôs relatively moderate update enough to warrant any revision,
and that _Mashable_ as a publication stands by my new laptop‚Äôs _Best of
the Year_ title, for whatever it may or may not be worth to you.

____
If the new
https://zdcs.link/zjWl1?pageview=06Fe2GZo26XvMYZgLndTadT[MacBook Air]
came in at the same price as the old one, it would be a steal. Sure, you
pay for the privilege of being able to use macOS on the Apple ecosystem.
But in years past that also meant access to cutting-edge features and
design. As pretty as the MacBook Air is, there's nothing that innovative
about it. In today's Apple, it seems, privilege amounts to just staying
current.
____

You won‚Äôt find many others who regularly invest editorial merit in
publishing 2500+ word laptop reviews anymore, which I‚Äôd concede is
plenty reasonable in the Surface Laptop‚Äôs case, at least. Perhaps your
first point of comparative entry should be
https://www.recode.net/2017/5/12/15628228/microsoft-surface-laptop-apple-macbook-air-windows-10s-dan-seifert-recode-podcast[a
barely-dated conversation] between Kara Swisher, Lauren Goode, and Dan
Seifert on _Too Embarrassed to Ask_ regarding the original‚Äôs odds of
truly competing in the ‚Äúpremium laptop‚Äù segment (if you‚Äôd prefer to hear
from those who struggle to take it seriously, that is.) Assuming
https://www.zdnet.com/article/what-oems-desperately-need-to-learn-from-microsofts-surface/[the
original product direction of the Surface line] still stands, Microsoft
doesn‚Äôt actually intend to sell at high volume, especially when it comes
to this runt of the marque, which does not hesitate to omit itself from
the popular discourse of the moment surrounding tablets as the future of
all computing to which all of its siblings have
https://www.theverge.com/2014/5/23/5743416/microsoft-surface-pro-3-review[contributed
so much]. Though I shall always remember my dearest Libel (the special
edition Spectre x360 with which I built most of _Extratone_) with great
respect and deep fondness ‚Äì I think it‚Äôs even worth mounting on some
sort of plinth ‚Äì the significantly-cheaper Laptop II has already
demonstrated true value in its ‚Äúpremium‚Äù segment bragging rights with
_far_ superior materials and build quality. If you‚Äôre looking for the
prettiest possible slice of magnesium lightness but aren‚Äôt the sort to
have followed the story of Microsoft‚Äôs first venture into personal
computer production since it began in the last year of the Mayan
calendar, it‚Äôs worth your while to read
https://www.theverge.com/2012/6/19/3097726/surface-microsoft-next-chapter/in/2859835[Joshua
Topolsky‚Äôs projections of the project‚Äôs impact on the popular narrative
surrounding Microsoft] from history‚Äôs freshest possible perspective: the
eve of the first Surface tablet‚Äôs launch.

____
The entire tablet was designed in-house by Microsoft's teams, and if you
believe what was said in the presentation yesterday, design and
functionality in hardware has suddenly become a big deal in Redmond.
That's a big shift, and it's an important one. The announcement of the
Surface shows that Microsoft is ready to make a break with its history ‚Äî
a history of hardware partnerships which relied on companies like Dell,
HP, or Acer to actually bring its products to market. That may burn
partners in the short term, but it could also give Microsoft something
it desperately needs: a clear story.
____

A pungent stigma festered from Microsoft‚Äôs history of inadequate and
inelegant public relations (especially compared to its greatest longtime
rival) has remained in relentlessly obvious orbit around every
‚Äúsignificant‚Äù Windows and Office update for so long that its status quo
has grown into a truly inhibitive force for _all_ parties involved.
Topolsky is unquestionably a compromising favorite of mine, but it‚Äôs
hard not to decry then-CEO Steve Ballmer‚Äôs failure to comprehend Josh‚Äôs
day-after insight in the _whole three months_ that passed before
http://old.seattletimes.com/html/businesstechnology/2019168601_microsoftballmer16.html[his
Seattle Times interview in September, 2012]. Ultimately, The Big M is
either *incapable* of understanding any alternative utopic Visions of
Computing to its own, or simply *overwrought* with the same
counteraspirational carelessness its culture has always depended upon.
In analytical terms regarding Ballmer‚Äôs utilization of the forum‚Äôs
opportunity to finally _tell the fucking story_, at least, the timidity
of a term like ‚Äúpre-eminent software‚Äù as a viably bright new beacon in
contrast with ‚Äú_people_ would say we were a software company‚Äù (emphasis
mine) ‚Äì as if Steve-O himself doesn‚Äôt even have the power to publicly
_describe his company‚Äôs function_ as its #1 man ‚Äì combined at the apex
of what was almost impressively-negligent behavior.

____
I think when you look forward, our core capability will be software,
(but) you'll probably think of us more as a devices-and-services
company. Which is a little different. Software powers devices and
software powers these cloud services, but it's a different form of
delivery...
____

Don‚Äôt make the same mistake I did and wear yourself out trying to
extract the meaning from these three sentences ‚Äì there‚Äôs none to be
found. Ultimately, whatever opportunity the Surface project could have
provided for Microsoft‚Äôs identity has been vastly overshadowed by its
success as last resort supercatalyst to restore _any_ sense of dignity
and pride within the hardware companies who produce the vehicles. In
Fall 2017, _The Register_
https://www.theregister.co.uk/2017/10/04/surface/[quoted industry
gossip] regarding the company‚Äôs new CEO Satya Nadella and his intent to
‚Äúexit the product line‚Äù because ‚Äúoverall they are not making money [and]
it doesn‚Äôt make sense for them to be in this business,‚Äù but newcomers to
this conversation should know that no subsequent reporting has
corroborated anything but a
https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/5/18125306/microsoft-fluent-design-windows-office-surface-future[sustaining
future of the line], though the measurable rate of innovation in
Microsoft‚Äôs products continues to leave much to be desired. Now that
you‚Äôve heard from the experts, though, allow me to expand our lens a bit
and examine what the Surface Laptop 2‚Äôs existence suggests as per _The
Present & Future of Computing_.

[[section0065.xhtml#the-clam-clan]]
=== The Clam Clan

In case I‚Äôve yet to mention it, all of my tech writing is in substantial
debt to my much-older and child-oriented siblings for providing 8 nieces
and nephews over the course of 11 years ‚Äì if not for any reason but the
perspective offered by the slightest observation of their day-to-day
lives. In this profoundly bizarre and historic technological sprint our
species is experiencing, the differences in their respective
relationships with consumer tech as they‚Äôve grown up are fascinatingly‚Ä¶
disturbingly significant. My eldest niece Abby was born four years after
myself in 1998, and her younger sister Amber just quite three years
later in 2001. All three of us are Aquarians who went to the same public
schools (aside from 2 exceptions on my part,) and the two sisters have
been close, significant influences on each other all their lives, yet
the way Abby and I use and think about computers differs significantly
from Amber‚Äôs. Our first real PCs introduced an important social and
intellectual vehicle to our pre-teen lives, and both of us still ‚Äúlive
on‚Äù our machines as young adults. For us and many others from this
short-lived microgeneration of ours, budget laptops like the Dell
Inspirion 2200 (which served as the first ‚Äúreal computer‚Äù for both of
us) introduced the internet and Being Online as a State of Being with
AIM groups, MySpace, and Yahoo! chain mails before smartphones and
tablets were capable of doing so.

Amber prefers to use her iPhone for most everything and regards her
computer as a tool for work ‚Äì it‚Äôs booted up and down exclusively for
that purpose, which is significantly healthier than the habit Abby,
myself, and many of my Online friends developed: we left our computers
running and Logged On all the time because we were otherwise
unreachable. We learned from origin to depend on them for 100% of our
computing tasks ‚Äì from streaming Pandora to playing Flash games within
six billion open browser tabs ‚Äì which likely explains both our ADD and
its resulting influence on the ease with which our personal computers
can distract us. As a Journalism student and professional photographer,
Abby uses the new 15-inch MacBook Pro, and [Insane Blogger] David Blue
has spent years looking for an alternative, becoming
http://bilge.world/ios-10-review-speed/[the first and only iPhone user
to make extensive use of its Bluetooth keyboard support] in the process,
but both of us are entirely uninterested in the rest of the industry‚Äôs
insistence on
https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/2/17515896/dell-xps-2-in-1-convertible-laptop-review[convertibles],
https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/16/17979504/microsoft-surface-pro-6-review-tablet-features-price-windows-10-matte-black[removable
keyboards], or
https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/5/18062612/apple-ipad-pro-review-2018-screen-usb-c-pencil-price-features[‚Äòprofessional‚Äô
tablets]. I wish the Linux community was finally ready to drop the
elitist pretenses plaguing its nerdy history; I wish I could finally
tell someone like Abby that a machine like the
https://www.pcworld.com/article/3198671/linux/the-system76-galago-pro-is-a-fierce-featherweight-competitor.html[System76
Galago Pro] could slot itself into her workflow without losing her time
or compatibility ‚Äì that the reputation surrounding Linux People had
finally lost most of its validity and her desire to learn more about
computing as a young woman and Power User would be met with respectful
and worthwhile conversation from their end. Unfortunately, I‚Äôve still
found some of the Old Guard to be elitist, socially behind, and
juvenilely possessive, as if computing was still the niche interest from
their 1980s and 90s childhoods. Though this conversation certainly
warrants its own essay in the future, I‚Äôll just express now that it‚Äôs a
real shame some folks don‚Äôt realize the entire point of making great
things is ultimately to *give them to the world*.

The opportunity I‚Äôve had in the past year to finally get my Linux distro
frenzy over with and out of my system managed to both radicalize and
democratize my understanding of MacOS, Windows, and Linux as they are in
the present. While I had nothing better to do, fiddling with Ubuntu
Studio and Linux Mint to the extent I did throughout Spring and Summer
led me to further appreciate
https://mastodon.social/@DavidBlue/101073796864823479[the value of
keyboard shortcuts], gave me
https://mastodon.social/@DavidBlue/100917824456128537[my first real
proficiency with a command line], helped
https://anchor.fm/davidblue/episodes/Revelations-of-Network-Withdrawals-e2d7aq/a-a235vs3[globalize
my comprehension of my own technological privilege], reacquainted me in
a huge way with both
https://www.reddit.com/r/vintagecomputing/comments/9hpqov/lotussmartsuite_and_the_year_2000/[the
true history of software] and my own personal past as
https://mastodon.social/@DavidBlue/100771954295147256[an experimental
test tube baby of Microsoft‚Äôs], and helped to answer a lot of questions
I‚Äôd worried over for years about why software seemed like it simply
_couldn‚Äôt improve_ anymore. While it‚Äôs true that important open source
projects like
https://www.forbes.com/sites/jasonevangelho/2018/09/10/elementary-os-first-impressions-a-great-linux-doorway-for-macos-users/#231f4faa4289[ElementaryOS]
continue to sprout from the Linus Extended Universe and the
http://bit.ly/dbmastodon[growing Open Source community on Mastodon] is
filled with brilliant, helpful, unpretentious, and remarkably curious
enthusiasts (probably because many of those I‚Äôve interacted with so far
are non-cis and/or non-white,) little ole me was able to stumble upon
some totally unnecessary and excruciatingly ignorant sociopolitical
commentary by way of the white, middle-age host and his
undoubtedly-white and staunchly libertarian caller on a live broadcast
of the _Ask Noah Show_. (It‚Äôs not as if I haven‚Äôt said ignorant and very
ugly things too, but I wasn‚Äôt a forty-something _father_ on a
semi-professional talk show representing an entire community.)

Essentially, I was quite frustrated and disappointed to find that *Linux
is still let down most by its own community*, but the operating system
itself is still _much_ further along on its way to becoming a real
alternative for the average user than mainstream tech journalism would
have you believe. However, in my case, finally taking the time to
_really_ learn about Open Source computing _also_ helped me understand
(surprisingly) why Apple and its environment continue to be the best and
most popular choice for professional applications. Linux Mint gave me
tremendous power in enabling me to alter, specify, and redesign the most
minute details of its interface, but I couldn‚Äôt have foreseen how
all-consuming such power would be for someone like myself. In
retrospect, I‚Äôve realized that I ended up spending more time perfecting
my custom LibreOffice Writer shortcuts than I did _actually writing_ ‚Äì I
somehow found myself in a mind state which justified unironically
creating _a shortcut for the Shortcuts menu_. Though I swore I‚Äôd never
succumb to the bewildering hobby of collecting and exploring different
Linux Distributions, it took no time at all for me to fill a folder with
disc images of the installers for almost a dozen different
interpretations of the operating system after I‚Äôd made the simple
concession to myself that _I‚Äôll just try Ubuntu, that‚Äôs all_. The most
profound realization from all this (arguably otherwise wasted) time:
*for a user like me, a walled garden is actually the best place to be
productive* because _apparently_, I don‚Äôt have the self-control to keep
myself from _running away_ and/or fixating on completely unproductive
tasks without its boundaries. I think this phenomenon is perhaps the
worst culprit in the persistence of the aforementioned divide between
‚Äúcomputer people‚Äù and everyone else who simply _uses_ computers, as I‚Äôm
sure any one of the latter could tell you after all of five minutes with
a Linus type.

The most comprehensive and somewhat-urgent revision to illustrate the
significance of this contrast from my perspective regards the
exceptional iOS/MacOS markdown-based notetaking app Bear. Frankly, my
own
‚Äúhttps://bilge.world/evernote-dropbox-paper-word-processing-history[Word
Processing Methodology]‚Äù essay from June has already become
problematically out of date (and therefore embarrassing) in terms of my
own knowledge of the segment and its history. Though I promised the
conversation was ‚Äúdone,‚Äù I‚Äôve continued to explore further into word
processing‚Äôs history as well as its current state. ‚ÄúI had a go at Bear‚Äôs
free iOS experience and saw little functional difference from DayOne,‚Äù
the old, negligent, cursory David Blue noted, but if I‚Äôd simply been
willing to cough up a bit more time and just $1.49 a month for
https://bear.app/#pricing[Bear Pro], I‚Äôd have spared myself such shame
and realized that the hype around this app really is 100% justified.
*Bear is the most beautiful iOS app I‚Äôve ever seen*, but I‚Äôm now also
fully qualified to declare it the most effective execution of
‚Äúdistraction-free‚Äù writing software to come along in the past 25 years.
Developer Shiny Frog‚Äôs secret is their perfect balance between
capability and simplicity. It turns out,
https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/2/14785264/evernote-replacement-bear-app[Daily
Content Lord Casey Newton‚Äôs word on this matter] _really was_ worth more
than mine, not to mention more succinct: ‚ÄúBear may look simple, but
there‚Äôs power underneath the surface.‚Äù

Those longtime Linux and Windows diehards who‚Äôve tolerated me thus far,
listen up: MacOS may be ancient, neglected, and full of incongruencies,
but its single-minded methodology paired with Apple‚Äôs iCloud _really
does_ make it the most effective and elegant environment for most people
to simply _get shit done_. It‚Äôs clear that many of you have realized the
importance of simplicity for compact and/or educational distributions,
but let me just add that *the democratization of Linux provides a
gargantuan development opportunity to make something that beats MacOS at
its own game* without starting from such a shitty premise and all of its
resulting compromises ‚Äì all without detracting from any other
technically-minded distributions whatsoever. _That_ is the magic of _The
Distro_, remember?! If you‚Äôve existed in a similar state of confusion to
that of my entire adult life regarding the appeal of Apple products ‚Äì
despite having once been an extensive OSX user, myself ‚Äì _you‚Äôre very
welcome_ for the insight. Instead of paying me for the profound
self-improvement I‚Äôve just provided, try prioritizing this newfound
knowledge the next time you talk to your MacBook Pro-loving friend about
their workflow. If you‚Äôre like myself, you‚Äôll find their arguments have
magically transformed from the bewildering bullshit they‚Äôve always
seemed to be into challenges for future competing operating systems to
surpass Apple‚Äôs old bitch and excel in because MacOS and
https://bilge.world/siri-shortcuts-ios12-review[even its much-younger
iOS counterpart] ‚Äì as well as the billions of people who depend on them
‚Äì _desperately_ need real competition in order to maintain their
viability, much less become what products of the world‚Äôs wealthiest
company _should_ be.

Yes, the manner in which these operating systems are perceived really
_is_ an important discussion prompted by a product as insignificant as
the Surface Laptop 2 because as you read, the industry is bracing for
another _paradigm shift_ in computing, which many believe
(preposterously, I might add) could be as significant and disruptive as
2007‚Äôs introduction of the iPhone. This machine of Microsoft‚Äôs and its
‚Äúnew‚Äù MacBook Air counterpart could potentially be the last designs to
carry us to a computing future where the tried-and-true clamshell design
is forgone entirely by the mainstream, but
https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/oct/30/apple-new-ipad-pro-launched-all-screen-design-face-id-usb-c-processor-magnetic-keyboard[Apple‚Äôs
release of this year‚Äôs new iPad Pro] prompted even
https://supercomputer.transistor.fm/13[the most Cupertino-loving] tech
commentators to respond with _genuine discord_ along with a few
long-overdue shouts of ‚Äú_are you crazy_?!‚Äù I‚Äôm very proud of _The
Verge_‚Äôs http://twitter.com/reckless[Nilay Patel], in particular, for so
eloquently deconstructing its usability for all but the very wealthy.
‚ÄúIt is impossible to look at a device this powerful and expensive and
not expect it to replace a laptop for day-to-day work,‚Äù he reminds us in
the introduction to
https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/5/18062612/apple-ipad-pro-review-2018-screen-usb-c-pencil-price-features[his
full review of the updated product], along with a beautifully transient
sentiment which I think we all needed to hear again: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think
people should adapt to their computers. Computers should adapt to
people.‚Äù Even something as consumerist and bourgeois as the introduction
of another pricepoint-burgeoning Apple hardware flagship can turn a
simple tablet review into a much-needed manifesto for a user-centric way
forward for the industry, which is itself worthy of celebratory
encouragement.

I‚Äôve favored _The Verge_ and its cast long past the point of excess
throughout the span of my work about technology, but Nilay‚Äôs review and
its
https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/8/18075992/vergecast-podcast-330-ipad-pro-macbook-air-review[accompanying
episode of _The Vergecast_] are _truly_ special and profound gems of
content that shouldn‚Äôt be passed up. Apparently ‚Äì as the Editor-in-Chief
immediately insists as the episode begins ‚Äì his ‚Äúongoing theory‚Äù that
‚Äúthe more important you are, the less actually important work you do,
and the more likely you are to be an iPad user‚Äù roused anger from ‚Äúthat
whole class of [billionaires,]‚Äù but the experiences behind his argument
actually suggest that Apple‚Äôs own favorite child of late ‚Äì into which it
has begun investing and thereby implicitly _sponsoring_ over its much
older brother as the ultimate heir of the majority‚Äôs future computing ‚Äì
has unequivocally *failed* to do its part in growing the iPad Pro into
the ‚Äúlaptop replacement‚Äù we‚Äôd all heard so much about. Of iOS 12‚Äôs
performance as an operating system beneath true work-related tasks, he
exasperates ‚Äúyou have to spend all of your time figuring out how to do
stuff instead of doing stuff,‚Äù which I couldn‚Äôt help but hear as echoes
of my own late Linux lamentations. As thankful as I am to have finally
achieved enlightenment of the Planet Apple, I‚Äôm afraid I was pitifully
late: its very natural laws underwent their most brutal tests of the
21st century this past year. Now that I‚Äôve finally come to adore the
elegant effectiveness of a new generation of iOS apps like Bear, I‚Äôm
faced with yet another of the episode‚Äôs statements of weight: ‚ÄúI think
it‚Äôs time to stop pretending that the future of computing looks like
Apple‚Äôs restrictions.‚Äù On the opposing end of the line, the world‚Äôs
first trillion-dollar company‚Äôs _other_ major product release of 2018
https://www.engadget.com/2018/11/09/apple-macbook-air-review-2018/[managed
to disappoint] even the most fanatical fans of its original operating
system‚Äôs best-selling platform with
https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/6/18064552/macbook-air-2018-review-retina-keyboard-apple-features-battery-price[an
insultingly mediocre update to the MacBook Air] marque upon which it
https://www.engadget.com/2008/01/25/macbook-air-review/[once so fondly
doted].

My best friend‚Äôs parents bought her
https://www.theverge.com/2012/10/23/3540550/microsoft-surface-review[the
original Surface tablet] when she enrolled in art school, and her
frustration with its lackluster keyboard (among others) leads MacOS
alternative-seeking users like us to wish Microsoft had started with a
traditional design like the Surface Laptop first. Perhaps Apple and
Microsoft‚Äôs emphasis on their tablets is nothing but a bit premature for
the _most_ current crop of users, and the rest of my nieces and nephews
will expand upon an entirely different methodology of usership when they
receive their freshman computer. Those elders of us who still take the
Clamshell form seriously and love printing our documents are apparently
facing a future industry saturated with products we can‚Äôt believe in,
but it‚Äôs up to you to decide if this issue is worth expending your
energy in advocacy for either camp. With my 120+ word per minute
proficiency with physical keyboards, _I_ for one have been completely
bewildered by the iPad as anything but an indulgence for reading text on
the web, and I‚Äôm pleased as punch with my Surface Laptop 2. Even if it
proves to be the last new computer I‚Äôll ever own to come as optimized
for my use, I‚Äôm just grateful and astonished it happens to be the best
yet.

My girlfriend very generously offered to go for a drive with me
yesterday evening, though neither of us particularly expected to end up
parked at 5:40AM outside a little Diner called Ziggie‚Äôs some four hours
away from home. I managed to learn a bit about driving apps and briefly
flood my Jetta‚Äôs intake long enough to stall it after fording some flood
water a wee bit too rapidly.

Since I‚Äôve begun working in Kansas City and occasionally commuting from
Columbia, I‚Äôve found incentive to revisit the crowdsourced driving
directions mobile app https://apple.co/2PJuh5y[Waze], which I recall
being very excited about in early 2016. It‚Äôs smoother now, yet devoid of
that pseudocountercultural sense in a design sense. Functionally, it is
still _the_ most reliable method of police detection I‚Äôve ever
encountered ‚Äì in this Second Era of my Waze usage I have yet to see a
single Missouri Highway Parol car sat in the center of I-70 that hadn‚Äôt
been reported on Waze first ‚Äì even at crazy hours on weekday mornings ‚Äì
which should be all the reassurance one needs regarding the immediate
future of their userbase.

____
I'm using Waze to drive to to Licking, MO, arriving at 2:24. Watch my
drive in real-time on the Waze map! https://t.co/b6InZBSRdc[David Blue
on Twitter]
____

Somehow, I was unaware until this morning that Waze allows you to
‚Äúshare‚Äù your route by generating a link to a web app of theirs that will
live track your progress. Though I can‚Äôt actually imagine too many use
cases for this, I still think it‚Äôs cool. Anybody who‚Äôs interested in
stalking my every move should http://twitter.com/neoyokel[follow me on
Twitter] ‚Äì where I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôll be sharing more drives from now on ‚Äì
and/or DM me and just ask me to enable 24/7 location-sharing for ya!

On the topic of mobile apps for those folks like me who‚Äôs only real
hobby is just fucking driving around, I did actually find mention in a
listicle from a _real motoring enthusiast‚Äôs publication_.
‚Äúhttps://www.roadandtrack.com/car-culture/travel/tips/g6477/seven-best-apps-for-driving-road-assistance/[Seven
Apps That Will Help Improve Your Driving Experience]‚Äù is not exactly the
sort of advisory article I remember seeing in _Road & Track_ considering
that it actually only contains one single app even vaguely related to
True _Driving Pleasure_ called http://www.greatestroad.com/[Greatest
Drive].

____
Users contribute their favorite routes and with Yelp integration you can
either pick a destination to find the most scenic way to get there or
find a good spot to eat along the route you've already chosen.
____

Of course, it‚Äôs nowhere to be found on the App Store, but it sounded
relatively foodist anyway.

[[section0068.xhtml#premium-desktop-mastodon-clients-incoming]]
=== Premium desktop Mastodon clients incoming?

Since you last heard from us, the federated social network
https://extratone.com/mastodon-eugen-rochko-federated-social-network[Mastodon]
has scaled tremendously in usership and steadily grown technologically
into an incredibly robust and dynamic platform. Perhaps inevitably,
Eugen Rochko and his gaggle of open source developers have continued to
embarrass the living fuck out of Twitter's team ‚Äì at least for those
who've continued to pay attention (i.e. those of us whose sense of
aspiration has yet to perish.)

I planned on getting ahead of an innovative wake in iOS development by
watching closely for the first ‚Äúpremium‚Äù Mastodon clients to come out,
which I suspected (quite correctly) would carry the first substantial
risk-taking on the part of plucky social apps to be seen on the
goddamned App Store in what felt like eternity. Unfortunately, I've
ended up far too deep in screenshots/insights from
*http://bit.ly/tootios[Toot!]* and *http://bit.ly/mastios[Mast]*,
creating a bit of an overwhelming obstacle in comparing and/or reviewing
the two without sinking deep in my regular, pretentious hole. (Though
both of them are absolutely gorgeous, fascinating, and impressive
projects which you should invest in and follow if you're interested in
the future of federated social whatsoever.)

*That said*... I'd like only to mention and
https://youtu.be/k7KDk-VV6wc[briefly demonstrate] the first premium
_desktop_ Mastodon client, *_http://bit.ly/mastonaut[Mastonaut]_*, which
I had the privilege of experiencing momentarily last night.

image:xhtml/https:/i.snap.as/hFeyH28.png[Mastonaut Add Instance]

In the interest of brevity (and because I was unable to continue fucking
around for any length of time,) I'll just list some observations:

* The entire GUI experience is distinctly uncluttered (or perhaps
_barren_, depending on your subjective desires from this sort of thing,)
but duplicates dearest
https://extratone.com/tweetbot-5-ios-review-twitter-client[TweetBot]'s
functionality impressively well considering its age as an
independently-developed product.
* Keyboard shortcuts! Fuck me, God.
* I love the live-updated instance directory search (above) as a second
landing for first-time users.
* Though I did actually have to repeat the first-time login process
after freezing and subsequently force-quitting Mastonaut, I think you'll
probably place the blame on my own immediate and inpatient window
management mania considering how smoothly it all went the second time
around.

To be honest,

https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/spark-email-app-by-readdle/id1176895641?mt=12[Spark],
and recent other beautiful Mac applications beckon me to buy or hack
myself into MacOS again. If I have time in the near future, I'll show
you why.

You fight your superficiality, your shallowness, so as to try to come at
people without unreal expectations, without an overload of bias or hope
or arrogance, as untanklike as you can be, sans cannon and machine guns
and steel plating half a foot thick; you come at them unmenacingly on
your own ten toes instead of tearing up the turf with your caterpillar
treads, take them on with an open mind, as equals, man to man, as we
used to say, and yet you never fail to get them wrong. You might as well
have the _brain_ of a tank. You get them wrong before you meet them,
while you're anticipating meeting them; you get them wrong while you're
with them; and then you go home to tell somebody else about the meeting
and you get them all wrong again. Since the same generally goes for them
with you, the whole thing is really a dazzling illusion empty of all
perception, an astonishing farce of misperception. And yet what are we
to do about this terribly significant business of _other people_, which
gets bled of the significance we think it has and takes on instead a
significance that is ludicrous, so illequipped are we all to envision
one another's interior workings and invisible aims? Is everyone to go
off and lock the door and sit secluded like the lonely writers do, in a
soundproof cell, summoning people out of words and then proposing that
these word people are closer to the real thing than the real people that
we mangle with our ignorance every day? The fact remains that getting
people right is not what living is all about anyway. It's getting them
wrong that is living, getting them wrong and wrong and wrong and then,
on careful reconsideration, getting them wrong again. That's how we know
we're alive: we're wrong. Maybe the best thing would be to forget being
right or wrong about people and just go along for the ride. But if you
can do that‚Äîwell, lucky you.

Yes, I am still managing to waste my time digging up and re-arranging
some _very_ old content, but I just couldn't resist. Somehow, it didn't
occur to me until yesterday evening that I could sort through the
original video files of my old vines fairly easily in fucking Google
Photos and blast them through iMovie for iOS into a full montage
relatively easily.

Some of these are very cringey...

Yes, I'd love to finally get around to my ultimate romantic

are way too jumbled right now, obviously.

*In case you're similarly long overdue for a reminder that beautiful
things are still being made on the internet...*

After nearly a year of relative sobriety from my old, once-severe
addiction to Web Site hunting, it occurred to me just yesterday that
some explicit wandering as I once did for days at a time ‚Äì through the
clever, innovative, and uniquely tasteful projects through which an
astonishingly-original few give their whole thinking (and often
physical) selves in obscurity despite how little financial (and often
professional) incentive is maintained by those who unknowingly need it
the most ‚Äì might be the best feasible remedy to my current, most
perplexing state of faithlessness and bafflement toward the ambitions of
trades and cultures I feel I once so thoroughly understood. A great
portion of you are surely undergoing your own manifestations of the same
hopelessness ‚Äì I cannot _ever_ remember a time in my life when global
events were so _utterly_ discouraging so relentlessly.

=== Askeptical spectacle in the day-to-day typhoon of Faith‚Äôs modern enterprise.

The year I was given my first generation iPhone was the last of 14
through which my mother was still comfortable enforcing my obligation to
attend Sunday morning church service. She and my stepfather had migrated
18 months or so prior from [Suburban Church of Mediocre Dope
Christ-Appropriated Lukewarm Diluted Prog Rock and The Occasional
Teachings of Protestant-ish Side-Glances at The New Testament] to the
https://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/23/movies/how-the-true-false-film-festival-and-a-church-work-together.html[_New
York Times_-appointed champion] of Columbia Missouri‚Äôs
https://www.komu.com/news/mega-church-growth/[20-Year-Long] _Quirk the
Church!_ Sovereignty Crusade: _The Crossing_. Like its competitors (of
which my parents‚Äô previous church had ranked quite poorly,) the
blatantly death-cult-sounding House of God includes its own artisanal,
latte-equipped coffee shop (I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if it‚Äôs _actually_ a
Starbucks affiliate at this point,) a regularly-replenished catering
table full of doughnuts immediately to the side as one enters, and a
sophisticated childcare operation staffed no less thoroughly than my
public elementary school.

Since 2007, the church has been expanding from its first home (as a
functional place of worship, anyway,) which lies within 1) line-of-sight
from one of
https://www.insidephilanthropy.com/dance/2013/7/31/nancy-walton-laurie-ballets-next-best-friend.html[Nancy
Walton]‚Äôs properties, 2) a mile of the southernmost exit off US-63 ‚Äì
mid-Missouri‚Äôs primary North‚ü∫South roadway ‚Äì and includes a powered
pump-arrogated pond, though the majority of the acreage is blackened by
pragmatically-arrayed big box store-caliber multi-rowed parking. Ye, by
night, it is flooded in coordinately-distributed cold white light
suspended by the same uniform steel poles which guard long-term airport
lots. Naturally, the entry and exit points for the asphalt spread are
arranged deliberately opposed so that four figures‚Äô worth of God‚Äôs
children may be fed, digested, and evacuated through their weekly
appointment with Christ as efficiently and _hassle-free_ as possible.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rhSDfm1ZEc

God‚Äôs ~white~ children become _especially_ sensitive to entirely-trivial
delay or other perceived deviation from Their Expectations when inside
an automobile thanks to a rampant misconception that simultaneously
allows them a renewed sense of control over their environment.
Psychoanalytic observation has suggested it is catalyzed by delusions of
physical anonymity, exemption from civic responsibility, and a
titanically-inflated perception of their personally misattributed
contributions to the perpetuation of the universe. This vehicular
component of the customer experience is a fundamental ingredient in _The
Crossing_‚Äôs stellar member retinenance record ‚Äì the single metric above
all quantifying a Christian organization‚Äôs overall effectiveness in
accomplishing the faith‚Äôs (mostly cross-denominational) evangelistic
Prime Directive / General Order Number One as
https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+28%3A18-20&version=NIV[abridged
by Christ himself] to the Pharisees after his resurrection: ‚Äúgo and make
disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of [The Holy
Trinity].‚Äù I did not take the opportunity to sample _The Crossing_‚Äôs
baptismal services, but I‚Äôm sure sufficient combing of
https://yelp.to/qTKq/U3zCk0HlEY[the church‚Äôs Yelp! page] would yield as
qualitative an analysis of such a ‚Äúservice‚Äù as you could possibly
imagine. (Notably, it would appear the ‚Äúlowest‚Äù review is
https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-crossing-columbia?hrid=1iW1Q9KCi9WlM3mDzNFvKw&utm_source=ishare[the
singular 4/5 star entry].)

I do not mean to disparage _The Crossing_, specifically nor even
organized religion, generally, but instead to emphasize the absurdities
which have leapt just as readily into what I‚Äôd specifically call _The
Business_ of white protestant Christianity over just the course of my
own maturation as it has into any other aspect of our lives. The
difference, of course, is the universal set of exceptions ‚Äì and the
particular _age_ of said exceptions ‚Äì which religion maintains,
societally. The perspective formed by my own experiences having grown up
wholly embedded across the spectrum of white midwestern Christianity ‚Äì
including two years of vigorous and quite academic study of the Bible in
a tiny private school headquartered in the basement of a Lutheran church
‚Äì lends to a particular skepticism, amusement, horror, offense, and
existential astonishment that latches my fascination into a
not-entirely-voluntary hold.

(Before I go on, I suppose I should also note that it‚Äôs been at least
two or three years since I last set foot inside the church building at
all ‚Äì my _only_ recent experiences/engagement with _The Crossing_ has
been with their digital content from a relative distance.)

The ludicrous parallels between Apple events and services at _The
Crossing_, especially, come immediately to mind every single time I
watch one (live or otherwise,) as they did just weeks ago when I first
engaged with https://youtu.be/psL_5RIBqnY[this summer‚Äôs WWDC keynote].
Pastors https://www.thecrossingchurch.com/staff/dave-cover/[Dave Cover],
https://www.thecrossingchurch.com/staff/keith-simon/[Keith Simon], and
https://www.thecrossingchurch.com/staff/shay-roush/[Shay Roush] all
look, dress, speak, and photograph _exactly_ like Steve Jobs, Tim Cook,
Scott Foristell, Jony Ive, and just about any
https://www.apple.com/leadership/[public-facing leadership figure] we‚Äôve
ever seen giving an Apple Keynote. They‚Äôre hilariously interchangeable,
as are other explicit aspects of the typical Sunday morning service at
_The Crossing_. As far as I can tell, the church as a whole _only_ uses
Mac computers and the projections in the main auditorium/worship hall ‚Äì
mostly sing-along hymn lyrics and referenced bible verses ‚Äì are
exclusively created through Apple‚Äôs office presentation software,
Keynote, just as the company itself does for its ‚ÄúKeynotes.‚Äù This was
immediately obvious to me upon first entering that space because *they
both use the default theme* ‚Äì typography, color palette, transition
animations and all. Indeed, during the sermons, the three pastors would
take command of the slides by fairly inconspicuously clicking what I‚Äôd
imagine must be a very sweaty Apple Remote in the _exact_ same manner in
which Tim Cook and his underlings still do.

*I JUST REMEMBERED DAVE EXPLICITLY USING MENTION OF APPLE PRODUCTS IN
HIS SERMONS*

Nay, the likenesses do not diverge when comparing the fundamentals of
the two organizations more broadly: _The Business_ of the faith is very
much a _volume_ business, which also describes Apple‚Äôs contemporary
strategy with perfect precision. It‚Äôs been a few years since
‚Äúhttps://www.forbes.com/sites/ericjackson/2014/06/03/apple-isnt-a-hardware-or-software-company-its-an-ecosystem-company/[ecosystem]‚Äù
ceased to be an exhaustive buzzword in tech media discourse, perhaps
because the term falls very short in expressing the change in global
Apple *scale*. My recollection of high school biology has failed to
produce a scientific substitute, but I find Matt Honan‚Äôs
‚Äúhttps://www.wired.com/2014/09/apple-ecosystem/[very lovely swamp]‚Äù
exceptionally said in 2014, but the fact of the swamp‚Äôs becoming
generally lovelier in the interim ‚Äì in a less linear fashion than would
have been ideal, mind you ‚Äì leaves ample room, I think, to fear and
respect whatever it was that we then called _The Apple Ecosystem_ in
2014 as a *ruling deity or daemon* (just as

=== VW's Jumbo new offering is titanic to live with and genuinely amusing to drive, but is it a condescending German prank on America?

image:xhtml/https:/i.snap.as/XzLvAnV.jpg[[2019 Volkwagen Atlas SEL
w/4MOTION]]

Upon meeting an elderly recently immigrated German friend of my mother's
for the first time yesterday, she exclaimed _He looks German!... and so
tall!_ Both of these compliments were _relatively_ true, but certainly
not extremely. I am more German-looking than not, perhaps. Supposedly, I
am half a product of a very large family whose elders are only one and
two generations from German royalty ‚Äì my legal last name is on a state
sign in front of a small black castle somewhere in _Der Vaterland_. I
slacked through two years of high school German language classes ‚Äì Frau
Rosa once took me aside to ask _you‚Äôre not going to shoot up the school
or anything, right?_ (Sorry Frau & peers.) Though my much-older half
siblings grew up mostly in the town of Schweinfurt, I have never
actually set foot in Germany, yet I‚Äôve come to identify with and admire
its culture enough to (perhaps unjustly or inappropriately) feel
comfortable joking about Deutsche peculiarities as vain self-mockery.

Despite all of this (carefully nationalism-free) affection, the real
truth of myself is an American one. I have long since broached the point
of no return: no matter how hard I might try, I would never be able to
mold the Me another perceives in such a way that I‚Äôd become observably
German-native. I‚Äôm just a midwestern boy with a Germanic name on his
paperwork, and therefore have more in common with Volkswagen‚Äôs newish
entry into the _dramatically_ different full-size Sport Utility Vehicle
segment. The Atlas bears a
https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-11-17/what-s-in-an-suv-name-redemption-with-u-s-consumers-vw-hopes[remarkably
good name] (annoyingly,
https://www.thedrive.com/new-cars/9083/the-2018-volkswagen-atlas-finally-solves-vws-america-problem[literally
everyone's reviews] seem to begin with a comment on how _decipherable_
the new name is for Americans) ‚Äì especially among new automotive
products introduced to market in recent memory. Honda‚Äôs _Clarity_
*should* be clever alongside the definitively 21st-century _Insight_
marque, but violates an unfortunately universal law in the industry:
never name a car for a _state of being_ (Introducing the New 2020 Honda
_Ambiguity_ [_Insolence_, _Fugue_, _Debacle_, _Setback_]) ~especially~
one so obtusely irrelevant to the product itself. _Insight_ comes from a
chat with a colleague over coffee, but _Clarity_ is a metaphysical,
zealous plane that sounds our ever-inadequate platitude alarms in a very
unsettling manner. _Um... Is Honda doing okay?_ It not only ends up
irritating and off-putting: after Hannah‚Äôs season of _The Bachelorette_,
it‚Äôs just dumb, lazy, and foul.

____
After decades of trying to force Yankees into models that many found too
small, VW has figured it out: Big-ass SUVs are what Americans want, and
the Atlas is designed around the biggest asses you can imagine.
____

In contrast, the fucking Nissan _Kicks_ ages so swiftly and
uncomfortably that it‚Äôs pitifully tacky before it even hits the lot,
which is particularly disappointing considering the most cleverly
bestowed _Juke_ name was. One marvels at the situation Nissan has found
itself in: _young American black men love our brand, but they also love
shoes!_ Atlas, though, is on par with Honda‚Äôs _Odyssey_ inspirationally,
though a smidge more grounded through the distinctly Earthen science of
topography, just as it should be. Originally billed as a replacement for
https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/cars/2013/09/23/vw-routan-suv-crossblue/2856593/[VW‚Äôs
Routan minivan], the three-row Atlas is Volkswagen‚Äôs newest bid for the
Panic Room-loving American parent demographic. Therefore, it‚Äôs crucial
for us to examine it thoroughly for
https://www.businessinsider.com/vw-atlas-crossover-suv-review-2017-11[any
signs of condescension] from the Germans and their brand ‚Äúwhose business
in the US is built on providing small, fun-to-drive cars like the Golf,
the Beetle, the Jetta, and the Passat.‚Äù

____
From our perspective, what we have here is a German take on the American
family SUV. A Ford Explorer by way of Wolfsburg, if you will. Well, sort
of. The Atlas is actually built in Chattanooga, Tennessee alongside the
Passat sedan.
____

Unavoidably, the most notable, remarkable, and extraordinary item to
note about the Atlas is simply that *it is fucking fat*. Just about any
review you watch or read will mention this. Even _CNET_ calls theirs
‚Äúhttps://www.cnet.com/roadshow/reviews/2019-volkswagen-atlas-review/[a
very broad boy].‚Äù After I first read the number ‚Äì *5997 lbs.* ‚Äì I was
never able to escape it throughout the entirety of my time with it.
*_Three tons_* is unbelievably, inexcusably, violently, hopelessly
heavy. _Hopelessly_ not because it stands out in its segment, but that
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/457289420174000150/698509904629202996/2017_Vehicles_with_GVW_over_6000_lbs.pdf[_it
does not_]. Obesity is still a problem in America, but it's our
automobiles now. While we continue to worship safety and fuel economy
together, we skew the triangle (the other side is performance) further
and further, and yes ‚Äì a good portion of the blame can be placed on
https://www.npr.org/2016/05/09/477301486/why-americans-are-buying-more-trucks-and-suvs-than-cars[our
obsession with SUVs]. I spent 2018 driving a 1976 Lincoln Continental
Mk. IV around ‚Äì the second-longest two-door car ever sold at 228.1
inches from its pointed nose to its massive ass. Despite being a full
_thirty inches longer_ than the 2019 Atlas, my 460-powered mammoth yacht
weighed some 700 pounds _less_, and it was filled with _real wood_. I'm
no expert in physics by any means, but I can tell you that every pound
has
https://www.nrcan.gc.ca/sites/www.nrcan.gc.ca/files/oee/pdf/transportation/fuel-efficient-technologies/autosmart_factsheet_16_e.pdf[expounding
effects] on the energy required to move, turn, and stop a vehicle, which
just about sums up the ultimate formula to
https://www.autoblog.com/2009/10/29/greenlings-how-does-weight-affect-a-vehicles-efficiency[pulverize
efficiency]. When our friends at the IIHS say that ‚Äúfuel economy can be
improved without sacrificing safety,‚Äù they are just... *fundamentally
wrong*, (though _technically_ correct.)

I'm not entirely sure why the Atlas weighs so much, but its mass is
inevitably a major variable in just about every facet of its experience
as a product. The best potential hoot to be had from it as a driving
device should be sought by ordering it to shuffle briskly on curving
country blacktops in Sport Mode with all the assists (save for
lane-keeping) _on_. Not to be too crude, but it's fun to make the fat
fucker run. Through your ass, you can feel the suspension squirm and
struggle to redirect all
https://www.motortrend.com/cars/volkswagen/atlas/2018/2018-volkswagen-atlas-se-long-term-update-1-review/[266
lb.-ft. of VR6 oomf between 4 wheels] beneath an entirely separate war
against the physics of such top-heavy body roll.

_Scrambling_ is definitely the correct verb. Pleasantly light steering
in Comfort Mode (where I'd advise you leave it in virtually any
situation) combined with a supple-ish ride from multilink suspension
provide a trace of a past luxury sentiment not unlike the energy
exhibited by my old Connie through and through. It's all about the
sensation of *power*. Not in the horse sense, but in the satisfaction
achieved from the manipulation of maximum mass with minimum effort.
Comparatively, the level of actual ego-stroking is of course quite
miniscule, and unfortunately, it is the numbness that is most noticeably
left over with very little gain.

Also unfortunate: I did not end up making the opportunity to truly test
whatever offroad capabilities the Atlas may posses in any sort of
formalized test. My example came with Hill Descent Control and Hill
Start Assist, and I was able to find a small hill just steep enough to
https://youtu.be/REchJ_BD5G0?t=232[trigger the former]. I cannot say I'd
put my money on the Atlas winning the Dakar as it is, but we now know it
can handle wet grass on a mild incline. What about county road gravel?
Realistically, these are the two extremes 99% of Atlas' will ever face
in their usable service lives. I found an entirely quiet section of back
rock road and https://youtu.be/REchJ_BD5G0?t=321[walked through the
steps] to disable all of the traction and stability control assists
before stomping on the throttle, but was unable to provoke any
significant wheelspin. In
https://www.spreaker.com/user/autoline/aah-382-can-the-atlas-lift-volkswagen_3[an
episode of _Autoline After Hours_], Michael Loveti (Vice President,
Product Line Mid/Full-Size, Volkswagen Group of America, Inc.) confirms
the drivetrain _really is_ *all-time all-wheel-drive*, (though the dual
exhaust ports in the rear are
https://youtu.be/wCTUgQ-X4mw?t=395[unfortunately fake],) and that the
Atlas is actually based on
https://www.motortrend.com/news/explaining-volkswagen-mqb-architecture/[the
MQB platform], which is astonishing. Prospective buyers should
definitely have a listen.

This theme of ‚Äúthoroughly German, yet somehow distinctly Americanized‚Äù
occurs

and

and https://youtu.be/wCTUgQ-X4mw?t=444[over] again in the Atlas' story.
Its horizontal lines match both the Jetta and Ford's Explorer. In that
way, surely it is a success. I cannot imagine a better execution of its
marque's directives as stated by Mr. Loveti than what I drove.

____
Cover the Volkswagen logo and you might think the Atlas was made by
someone else. The hard lines and boxy shape are a sharp departure from
the rest of the VW lineup. But look at its competitors here in the
states, especially the Ford Explorer. It‚Äôs almost like Volkswagen tried
to build its own Ford with the Atlas.

Even though it has been on the market for only a year, the Atlas had
become VW's second-most-popular car in the German automaker's lineup in
March 2018, showing that the American car-buying public's thirst for
crossovers and SUVs remains unslaked.

==== Place in The Segment

The only other modern SUVs I've spent significant time with was the
Range Rover Evoque I crashed and the VW Tiguan I reluctantly borrowed
(and had absolutely nothing to say about,) so my authority in comparing
the Atlas with its competitors is severely lacking. However, I can at
least send you the way of _Regular Car Reviews_'

____
In the splitting of already fine hairs, it's the new Telluride that
makes a stronger case over the Atlas, thanks to its price advantage, its
plush and thoughtful appointments, and its slightly more comfortable
third-row.

=== The Passive Safety Fairytale

*Define*: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_safety[Active safety]

*Freedom through security*. In truth, neurotypical people are naturally
driven to minimize risk, yet also to romanticize the sick,
inhibitionless madmen ‚Äì to envy them both internally and externally (in
a most restrained way.) Collectively, our authority in (or mastery of)
risktaking remains pathetically irrational. If we were to itemize our
ability to asses risk into a sixth physical sense, it would rank just as
poorly against the rest of the world's creatures (or perhaps
neck-and-neck with those of the squirrel or the deer.)

So many struggles of the too-often-cited ‚ÄúHuman Condition‚Äù are grounded
in the incompetence of this sense. It shouldn't be surprising, then,
that risktakers in general are a very special topic amid The Middle
Class ‚Äì those who occasionally find themselves atop _just_ enough excess
to call it ‚Äúcapital.‚Äù This equates in day-to-day life as only the most
potent ‚Äì yet almost entirely inert next to the cushion of
multi-millionaires ‚Äì subject, catalyst, and indicator of dire fret. By
far the most widespread affectation of this petty affliction spreads
like divine wrath over the upper forty percent of this Middle Class.
Thus, we must ask ourselves _how safe doth the Atlas make me feel_?

loaner was less worn in because neither I nor my girlfriend found
anything wrong with the Atlas‚Äô interior quality ‚Äì even after bombing
gravel roads to the point of sustaining a left-rear puncture, we did not
encounter any annoying squeaks or rattles. She spent an entire afternoon

you‚Äôll be able to tell your friends that your Volkswagen has a digital
dashboard ‚Äújust like the Rolls-Royce Phantom,‚Äù which is, of course, the
ultimate Queen of timelessness in the industry. Perhaps it‚Äôs telling
that the only layout I found acceptable for the digital dash was the one
with simulated analog needles for the tach and speedo, and how often do
you _really_ use a compass in day-to-day driving? For that matter, how
useful could a digital compass in the speedometer‚Äôs center hub really be
in an ‚Äúoffroad‚Äù situation? It‚Äôs a bit petty, but I also really despise
the typeface shared across the instruments and infotainment system. It‚Äôs
just‚Ä¶ bad.

[[section0075.xhtml#outside]]
==== Outside

In Platinum Gray Metallic, the Atlas looks authoritative enough in a
very ordinary way. Unless you‚Äôre on the lookout for one, you‚Äôd hardly
notice it, and you certainly wouldn‚Äôt expect what you see to cost as
much as it does. That is why I‚Äôd prefer _any_ one of the
https://web.archive.org/save/https:/www.elginvw.com/blog/what-colors-does-the-2019-volkswagen-atlas-come-in/[other
exterior finishes], especially (in order): Pure White, Tourmaline Blue
Metallic, Pacific Blue Metallic, and Fortana Red. The real wonder is how
VW managed to execute a seven-seat SUV with its existing design
language. Though the Atlas is by far Volkswagen‚Äôs largest vehicle, it
fits neatly within their lineup.

[[section0075.xhtml#road-rage]]
=== Road Rage

My only authentic Road Rage experience in some 5000 miles of rideshare
driving occurred on All Hallow's Eve when I stopped ‚Äì no more illegally
than usual ‚Äì on the opposite corner from a popular downtown Mexican
restaurant called The Nap with hazards and all courtesy interior lights
shining. The car immediately behind me hesitated no more than necessary,
but the Biggest Big Infiniti behind them (a QX80 ‚Äì the Atlas'
competitor) just... stopped. There was honking and frenzied, hoarse
screaming of _what the fuck are you doing?_ and such.

I responded with pleasantly amused but relatively-encouraging glances at
the impersonal black mass of the Infiniti's windshield through my
mirrors. I rolled down the Atlas' driver's side window and politely
gestured that they go around me, but failed to coax any movement
whatsoever from the ugly behemoth through at least two full cycles of
the nearby traffic light. There must be some aquatic authority in the
bulbous black ass of the QX80, for no one behind it seemed willing to
pass either. The driver waited significantly longer than you'd imagine
before emerging, huffy. She was wearing a classic poofy black North Face
vest some sort of slate gray turtleneck. Nothing below these were
stimulating enough to retain any memory of. _Uggs?_

How positive are _you_ that the truth has absolutely zero consequence:
contrasted silver-beige eyeliner and little eye contact, dirty-ish
straight blonde hair over a spray-tanned face, exhibiting zero anxious
tics or hesitation. She was obviously the New Matriarch, and she was
obviously _much_ more of an authority on traffic law than I. As she
approached, she scanned the street as one naturally does when they enter
a busy one... except it was completely empty, thanks to her blockade.
She first informed me that I was ‚Äúnot _supposed_‚Äù to be stopped there. I
tried to listen and respond with as much sincerity as possible as I
realized all at once that my behavior had genuinely _perturbed_ this
woman ‚Äì that her choice to leave the huge hideous warmth of the guppy
wagon to speak as humans to one another required great courage.

image:xhtml/https:/i.snap.as/ZATOFIE.jpg[2019 Volkwagen Atlas SEL
w/4MOTION and Prius-C]

I inserted the next logical question which I'd been screaming
telepathically: _can you not get around me?_ I began to pity her when I
then saw in her face the distinct possibility that _going around_ as a
concept had not occurred to her whatsoever. She stuttered a wee bit in
retorting ‚ÄúI could go around, but I don't want to get a ticket.‚Äù Here,
one of the most fascinating avenues of suburban psychology is explored:
Guppy Mom is not being ingenuine with this expression, nor has she had
an untoward experience with law enforcement, ever. Guppy Mom did know
her excuse was bullshit ‚Äì nobody has ever been written a traffic
citation for carefully circumventing an obstacle in the road. Given the
opportunity to interrogate this kernel of entirely uncompromising
obedience to utterly delusional traffic law superstitions, I think we'd
simply discover a life of unnaturally positive interactions with LEOs.
We must conclude, then, that the source of her fear was either myself or
the Atlas.

Granted, to her I am still a _Young Man_, and am therefore instinctively
programmed to believe myself more informed than literally everyone ‚Äì
even the very foundational architects of modern civilization. Her Stucco
Highness may have felt a representative of these builders (edgy take:
_she is in fact their servant_.) Her own folks surely complain regularly
about their distaste for disrespect, and my gig-economy, Austin
Powers-looking ass was somehow disrespecting the order laid down by her
would be (entirely fantastical) forefathers. Though her expression of
her quaint fear of such ‚Äúugliness‚Äù (if you will) is hard-headed, an
ugliest decision of hers (or her kin) idled behind me, its giant
seafood-looking mouth gaping, unhinged. It'd almost be more redeemable
if it was a hardcore, chronic mouthbreather. (The QX80 is actually
https://www.autoguide.com/auto-news/2019/05/2019-infiniti-qx80-pros-and-cons.html[powered
by a comparatively oldschool V8].)

Freedom from fear is the sum desire of all the most primitive
compulsions we share. Ultimately, the only efficient and reasonable
response to Mrs. Guppy's kind in such a situation is to very kindly
oblige, which I did, of course, with great respect and great pity. In
the months since this encounter, I'd been wondering what was missing
from the outline of this Atlas review. I recently realized that it is
this analysis of fear as a factor for the American carbuyer.

Though it has been disproven over and over again for
http://www.accessmagazine.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2016/07/access21-01-are-suvs-really-safer-than-cars.pdf[decades],
consumers often cite _safety_ as their primary motivation for buying
full-sized SUVs. Mrs. Guppy's Great Guffaw led me to realize why this
particularly disconnected supposition/folktale continues to thrive so
uninhibited by the truth: the _brand image_, physical presence, and
actual driving sensation must communicate and ‚Äúfeel‚Äù *safe* ‚Äì these are

see with their own eyes; feel with their own asses. They entrust their
souls to the Word of the Lord, but not their lives to the National

NHTSA for All Eternity.)

[[section0075.xhtml#the-collegiate-take]]
==== The Collegiate Take

The two or three nights I spent Uber/Lyft driving around my college town
shuttling Halloween party traffic in the Atlas were expectedly
uneventful. I had to create a preset text message to send immediately
upon connection with a rider to communicate as succinctly as possible
that I was _not_ going to be arriving in the Jetta Sportwagen on my
profile but instead in the Atlas, and to transparently try to make sure
that was okay. (No, drivers are not supposed to do this and you should
reserve the right to bail on a ride should you find yourself opposite my
own position in this situation because nobody refused me.)

____
Hello! Just a heads up: My Jetta is in the shop so I'm driving a *gray
2019 Volkswagen Atlas*

(It's VW's largest SUV and has 7 seats.)

License: *FATLAS*

If this is inconvenient or uncomfortable for you, please let me know.

Thank you!
____

I made a point to try and ask most of the riders if they had any
thoughts on the Atlas without sounding like I was just desperately
fishing for compliments on my own car, but I don't remember any
significant thoughts being imparted whatsoever ‚Äì certainly nothing
negative. Folks here are just too polite ‚Äì they won't speak up no matter
how many times you insist that you _do not own the car_. We experienced
this phenomena years ago when we tried to
https://youtu.be/MLYdky3BKa4?t=443[interview people on the street]
regarding the horrid Nissan Murano CrossCabriolet. Regardless, there's
no reason to expect young people to have anything to say about the Atlas
‚Äì it is neither extraordinary nor cheap.

If you are an American carbuyer, you might give a shit about the sort of
awards manufacturers love to quote in their television commercials like

buyers and critics alike are letting us know that we‚Äôre hitting the mark
with this seven-seater SUV.
____

It's immediately evident from the outside that the Atlas is the most
Americanized product in Volkswagen's lineup ‚Äì indeed,

bonnet and roof‚Äù before remarking on
https://www.vw.com/builder/tab/trim/model/touareg/[just how much more

____
Ultimately, the Atlas is far from a dynamic, agile machine, but it feels
comfortable and unintimidating to drive, and perfectly at home on US
city streets and the slower-paced driving of California highways.

[[section0075.xhtml#efficiency-the-other-fixation]]
=== Efficiency, the Other Fixation

Surprisingly, the Atlas carries a rare and precious jewel of automotive
history under its broad, satisfying hood. The VR6 ‚Äúzig zag‚Äù arrangement
is actually one of
https://www.roadandtrack.com/car-culture/a9988768/volkswagen-vr6-dying/[Volkswagen
legend] ‚Äì defining icons like the Corrado. As
https://www.evo.co.uk/volkswagen/corrado[Dan Prosser explains for _Evo_
magazine]:

____
‚ÄòVR‚Äô stands for V-Reihenmotor, which translates to V-Inline, describing
both vee and inline cylinder layouts. That is, of course, contradictory.
The unit is actually a very narrow-angle V6, displacing 2861cc, with two
offset banks of cylinders at 15 degrees to one another. Unlike a
conventional V6, but exactly like an inline six, there‚Äôs just one
cylinder head. The result is a six-cylinder engine that‚Äôs both much
narrower than a typical V6 and shorter than a straight six. In fact,
it‚Äôs more comparable in size to a four-cylinder than a six, which meant
it could slot easily into a Golf floorpan. A creative and borderline
ingenious engineering solution.
____

The Atlas' 3.6L VR6 makes 276 hp and 266 lb-ft. of torque. Though
https://www.motortrend.com/cars/volkswagen/atlas/2018/2018-volkswagen-atlas-se-long-term-update-3-review/[other
reviews] cited highway mileage figures of 23-25 mpg, I was able to coax
a whole _twenty-eight_ miles-per-gallon on a
https://www.pscp.tv/AsphaltApostle/1MnxnEBYwgdJO[live Periscope stream]
without air conditioning or cruise control through a two-way simulated
20 minute commute, through which I suffered for the hard data. My
average before resetting the odometer for that feat, though, was
14.7mpg. ‚ÄúGood range and miles between trips to the gas station are
criteria I look for in a good car, and the fuel-gulping Atlas rates low
in this department‚Äù may be the blandest statement of all time, but
_MotorTrend_ does have a point ‚Äì with the same 18.6 gallon fuel tank
shared between the four and six cylinder models, the latter
realistically has 250 miles of range between fillups, which is pitiful
for a modern vehicle in just about any segment.
https://goo.gl/maps/cW8GwjGNRhnffo2Y9[Crossing one State] is not enough.

[[section0075.xhtml#an-attempted-conclusion]]
=== An Attempted Conclusion

So, is the Atlas indeed just a lucrative German prank on Americans? If
it is, the subtleties are beyond even me. In the time since I drove the
Atlas last year,
https://www.caranddriver.com/reviews/a31215717/2020-vw-atlas-cross-sport-drive/[Volkswagen
has unleashed] the Atlas Cross Sport on American roads. Apparently, it
is
https://www.autoweek.com/drives/a31151883/the-2020-volkswagen-atlas-cross-sport-is-the-suv-for-dinks/[the
ideal SUV for ‚Äúdual incomes, no kids],‚Äù or ‚ÄúDINKS‚Äù (surprisingly, not a
homophobic slur.) _MotorTrend_, on the other hand, argues the ideal
buyer has
‚Äúhttps://www.motortrend.com/cars/volkswagen/atlas-cross-sport/2020/2020-volkswagen-atlas-cross-sport-interior-review/[teenagers
who are growing faster than dandelions].‚Äù

____
It's a straightforward conversion from Atlas to Atlas Cross Sport. In
the name of perceived sportiness, out goes that most minivan of things:
the third row of seats.
____

Normally, I'd be disgusted with such a thing, but from where I'm
sitting, the Cross Sport _appears_ to be what the Atlas should've been
all along. The third row seats in my example wasn't any more comfortable
than that of a 10-year-old minivan, so removing them for the sake of the
second makes perfect sense. According to _Car & Driver_,
https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a30186943/vw-atlas-2021-preview/[the
2021 Atlas will ‚Äúadopt‚Äù the Cross Sport's styling], though there are
some technologies ‚Äì like road sign recognition- which are
https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a29105149/vw-atlas-cross-sport-2020-tech-features/[exclusive
to the Cross Sport].

____
Instead of getting 20.6 cubic feet of cargo space behind the third row
in the Atlas, you get 40.3 behind the second row. Fold that down and it
becomes 77.8 cubic feet to work with. And that‚Äôs from an SUV with the
same wheelbase as the upcoming 2021 Atlas at 117.3 inches, yet it is 5.2
inches shorter and 2.2 inches lower to the ground.
____

There was even a
https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/first-drive-volkswagen-atlas-tanoak-pick-concept[one-off
concept Atlas pickup called the Tanorak], and no one seems to yet know
whether or not it (or something similar) will be put into production. As
far as longevity and extended livability is concerned, enough time has
passed since the Atlas' release for long-termer conclusion posts to be
published from the likes of
https://www.caranddriver.com/reviews/a26897709/2019-volkswagen-atlas-reliability-maintenance/[_Car
& Driver_],
https://www.cars.com/articles/2018-volkswagen-atlas-road-trip-kansas-city-here-we-come-1420702979148/[_Cars.com_],
and
https://www.motortrend.com/cars/volkswagen/atlas/2018/2018-volkswagen-atlas-se-long-term-verdict/[_MotorTrend_].
The last of these reported an
https://www.motortrend.com/cars/volkswagen/atlas/2018/2018-volkswagen-atlas-se-long-term-update-4-review/[odd
turning radius issue] which was eventually
https://www.motortrend.com/cars/volkswagen/atlas/2018/2018-volkswagen-atlas-se-long-term-update-5-review/[fixed
by Volkswagen].

____
Once we got the steering fixed, my opinion of the Atlas did grow
sunnier, though it's still not perfect. Maybe it's not fair to compare
the driving experience to my previous long-term vehicle, the slightly
smaller Mazda CX-9, but in my opinion the Mazda still sets the ride and
handling bar for the competitive set. Setting the Mazda aside, if you
hop behind the wheel of one of the newer competitors like the Kia
Telluride, there's a noticeable disparity in the refinement in ride
quality and body control in the Atlas... *Volkswagen should have made
the GTI of three-row SUVs, not just another minivan alternative*.
____

This pullquote from
https://www.thecarconnection.com/overview/volkswagen_atlas_2018[Andrew
Ganz‚Äôs _The Car Connection_ review] is as good a summary as I could ever
come up with:

____
The 2018 Volkswagen Atlas does little wrong, but it's light on
personality and a little low-rent inside‚Äîand it guzzles fuel. It's worth
a look, but mostly rivals do more for less.
____

Volkswagen‚Äôs first substantial entry into the SUV market is well-named,
relatively well-endowed, fairly bland for its price tag, and very, very
heavy. Also, Start/Stop is still unbearable ‚Äì thanks Obama ‚Äì but the
Atlas is not a scam.

____
Volkswagen traditionally tuned its suspensions closer to the European
ideal, firm but well-damped, which incidentally made even non-enthusiast
Volkswagens more pleasant than average to drive (with a few recent
exceptions). But Volkswagen made a conscious decision to soften up the
Jetta for American tastes, beyond what softening Volkswagen
traditionally applied, and it seems like this philosophy scaled up to
the much larger Atlas. Maybe the soft ride impresses on test drives, but
a firmer setup would likely make life nicer for occupants over the long
haul.

I don‚Äôt want you to think this is just another listicle to mark as spam
or ignore completely ‚Äì though it technically is, I suppose. I know how
it looks‚Ä¶ because I‚Äôve run into many of them and have been just as
irritated as you. In fact, I would be so bold as to presume I‚Äôve run
into _many many_ more than you have simply because a primary hobby of
mine has always been Just Trying to Do Things On The Computer without
any academic authority or hands-on training. This is a way of life for
my generation and those proceeding it, yes, but I promise you that I
have gone far, far deeper than the vast majority of anyone you know.
What I‚Äôm ultimately trying to do here is to spare you the hundreds ‚Äì
perhaps _thousands_ ‚Äì of hours I have had to spend mulling through
shitty workflows throughout my childhood and adulthood before I stumbled
upon Good Practices (i.e. Better Ways to Do Things.)

https://open.spotify.com/episode/5FqjgOG6DFHQLUb7fnoOth

I want you to come away from this list feeling as liberated and powerful
as I do now when I‚Äôm On My Computer without any condescension or tedium.
Unfortunately, there‚Äôs probably going to be some of both, so please
stick with me and don‚Äôt take it personally. I do _a lot_ of online
reading, writing, and fiddling. I‚Äôve been compelled to do these things
in one form or another since very early childhood, and what follows
could be described as a list of my favorite tools to accomplish things.
Almost all of them are entirely free to use and the vast majority of
them are easily and beautifully functional as well. They are what I
suggest for my own mother to use, for what that‚Äôs worth, and I would
argue sincerely for their extreme importance. _Don‚Äôt waste your life on
bad software._

[[section0077.xhtml#you-need-a-password-manager]]
=== You Need a Password Manager

In 2020, password managers are no longer optional for digital life.
*They are mandatory*. If you only ever heed a single piece of my advice,
ever, _please_ make it this one.
https://www.pcmag.com/picks/the-best-password-managers[Most password
managers available] are secure, cross-platform, optionally cloud-synced
tools that help you generate, store, and organize digital credentials.
More likely than not, you‚Äôre already using one in your favorite browser.
On MacOS and iOS, Safari is linked to a service called Keychain, which
is ‚Äì functionally ‚Äì a robust password manager. On signup for a given
website or service, Safari should prompt you to automatically generate
secure, complex passwords to store in Keychain. Generally, it‚Äôs pretty
smart about knowing when it‚Äôs time to retrieve the credentials with
Touch-ID, but for when it _isn‚Äôt_, you should know
https://support.apple.com/guide/keychain-access/what-is-keychain-access-kyca1083/mac[how
to manually retrieve passwords from Keychain]. If you‚Äôre deeply enough
embedded into the Mac ecosystem, you can feel free to continue to rely
on this process as long as you know how to help yourself when it fails.
I‚Äôm not going to tell you who to trust, but I do _almost_ actually
believe in Apple‚Äôs commitment to securing user data, if only because of
the way their incentives are aligned (in contrast with those in front of
data-funded organizations like Google.)

If you‚Äôre using a Windows Home Machine and/or an Android smartphone, I
believe it‚Äôs more urgent that you find a standalone password management
solution immediately. I use a gorgeous app called
https://www.enpass.io/[Enpass] to store all of my passwords as well as
my bank credentials, credit cards, driver‚Äôs license information, and
anything else I might need to keep handy, securely. I can use virtually
any cloud or file-sharing service to keep my ‚Äúvaults‚Äù synced between all
of my devices: Microsoft OneDrive, Google Drive, Dropbox, iCloud, Box,
etc, and I also regularly create encrypted local backups just in case. I
can even _share_ end-to-end encrypted credentials with another device or
Enpass installation. I migrated to Enpass two years ago after using
https://www.consumerreports.org/password-managers/best-password-managers-review-digital-security-privacy-ease-of-use/[1Password]
for nearly 10. It was intuitive and virtually seamless, as such things
in software tend to be these days, and as a result, I haven‚Äôt had to
memorize a single password since my adolescence. Enpass allows me to
create custom login templates for quick differentiation when creating
new entries as well as picturized categories and tags. With one click,
even the icon can be pulled from a given URL‚Äôs favicon to help keep my
vault looking visually itemized. It also includes presets for a hundred
services or so ‚Äì from Google to Wix to Yahoo! Japan.

[[section0077.xhtml#total-recall-with-a-clipboard-manager]]
=== Total Recall with a Clipboard Manager

Imagine if everything you had ever copied (as in *Ctrl-C*) were listed
in linear order, https://vimeo.com/407790756[easily and instantly
searchable] via a single global keyboard shortcut (*Alt-`*) and
navigable with the arrow keys. Imagine if you could then export an
archive of your clipboard so _nothing_ could ever be lost. Imagine
clipboard _tabs_ that are easily switchable.
https://hluk.github.io/CopyQ/[CopyQ] ‚Äì an ‚Äúadvanced clipboard manager‚Äù ‚Äì
is one of my favorite software discoveries of all time. Some workdays, I
use it literally hundreds of instances in my workflow. It is difficult
to describe how much more useful it makes the clipboard feature ‚Äì
something we‚Äôve all been using for decades, now. For someone like me who
https://extratone.com/three-years-of-good-reads[copies a ridiculous
amount of links every day], CopyQ‚Äôs functionality has truly become
_life-changing_.

General]

[[section0077.xhtml#alt-d-and-other-keyboard-shortcuts]]
=== Alt-D and Other Keyboard Shortcuts

Somehow, I did not discover *Alt-D* until 2018, which means that I had
spent the entirety of my 24 years since _triple-clicking_ to select
every single URL I‚Äôd ever copied. I built a media company this way, and
I can‚Äôt believe nobody told me about this shortcut. Open any given web
browser, use *Alt-D*, and your selection will move to the URL in the
address bar on top of the page. It‚Äôs very possible this will be of
little use to you, but anyone who regularly shares or copies links will
save themselves _so_ much time. I felt the same way when I discovered
text navigation with *Alt*, *Shift*, *Ctrl* + the arrow keys. Most of
these are cross-platform, but I am specifically focusing on
https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12445/windows-keyboard-shortcuts[Windows
shortcuts] for this piece because that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm currently using.

[[section0077.xhtml#arrow-key-related-shortcuts]]
==== Arrow key-related shortcuts

¬∑ *Shift* in conjunction with the arrow keys selects text in a document
surrounding the cursor.

¬∑ *Alt* in conjunction with the arrow keys allows one to go forward or
backward in a browser.

¬∑ *Ctrl* in conjunction with the arrow keys allows one to navigate text
by word.

Virtually all of the ‚ÄúWindows logo key‚Äù shortcuts are usable in
day-to-day workflows. I use *Win-D* to immediately minimize all windows
and show the desktop on the regular. Microsoft is
https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/17/21224904/microsoft-windows-10-launcher-powertoy-spotlight-alfred-details[currently
testing] a feature like MacOS‚Äô spotlight which is triggered with this
key.

____
Designed to replace the existing Win + R shortcut, the new launcher will
include options to quickly search apps and files across Windows and
support for plugins like calculators, dictionaries, and search engines.
____

We can only hope this feature will be as useful as spotlight (which is
triggered with *‚åò-Spacebar* for you Mac users,) and will be implemented
as standard as soon as possible. If you‚Äôre not already using basic
shortcuts for functions like closing tabs/windows and cut/copy/pasting
text, I‚Äôd advise you to begin as soon as possible. It can be hard to
commit, but I promise it‚Äôll make your life better. Try printing out a
list of shortcuts for your particular operating system to keep by your
workspace and/or find or create an image of the list to set as your

quite simply the

piece of software ‚Äì aesthetically and functionally ‚Äì that I have ever

Editor. From
https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/2/14785264/evernote-replacement-bear-app[_The
Verge_‚Äôs Dieter Bohn]:

____
Bear uses a simple three-paned design. The largest column is devoted to
your current note. A smaller column to the left contains your notes in
reverse-chronological order, topped by a search bar. The left-most
column contains notes that you‚Äôve pinned, as well as any tags you‚Äôve
created to organize your notes ‚Äî
https://bilge.world/tag:recipes[#[.p-category]##recipes##], for example.
I spent years trying to sort my notes into notebooks in Evernote, only
to learn that what I really needed was a faster search box.
____

As much as I despise the term ‚Äúseamless,‚Äù everything about Bear is its
definition. For someone like me, it, alone, almost warrants a reversion
to MacOS. If you have the correct platforms, I _require_ you to try it.
Unfortunately, there can be no true Windows or Linux equivalent without
the work Shiny Frog has done to streamline Bear‚Äôs near-instantaneous
iCloud integration, but there is one application that can literally
simulate its functionality in every other way.
https://typora.io/[Typora] is an infinitely-customizable alternative
that spans all three platforms with a well-populated
https://theme.typora.io/[themes gallery] (including an
https://theme.typora.io/theme/cobalt/[actual copy] of my favorite Bear
theme.) My installation is not nearly as _smooth_ as Bear, but it‚Äôs
technically more powerful ‚Äì bad news for users like me who can‚Äôt resist
fiddling. I‚Äôve downloaded (and attempted to author/modify) a billion
themes for Typora. Bear, by contrast, allows _just_ enough stylistic
modification (color theme, a choice list of 7 beautiful typefaces, and
sliders for font size, line height, paragraph spacing,) without _any_
access to its internal workings. In this way, it provides the perfect
blend of customizability and minimalism. If you tend toward the latter,
try an ultra-slim solution like WordPress‚Äô

simply not enough runtime for a truly episodic television show anymore,

Admirals should not say _shut the fuck up_. The holograms are just

writing software, Extratone, blogging, and self-curation._

'''''

*So I am super curious that you mentioned Markdown as something that
saved you from fiddling your life away. Can you go more into that?*

I started an online magazine four years ago originally on WordPress. I
thought I knew something about web development, but honestly I did not.
It ended up becoming a fixation on trying to make something
_technically_ different from what I'd seen done with WordPress, which
detracted heavily from my Editorial duties over the years. I'm on the
OCD spectrum so I just couldn't let it go. I spent thousands of hours
fiddling with different themes and formatting within those themes, and
what I ended up with was a mess. I would make changes that would break
old posts, so I'd go back and fix those, only to make more changes
days/weeks/months later and have to go back again. I'd known vaguely
about Markdown, but it wasn't until it was mentioned in the WordPress
dev Slack that I really considered it seriously as a way out of what I'd
been doing. I realized that its inherit limitations were actually very
good for me ‚Äì that I needed a limited system to constrain my workflow to
keep myself on task. Finally, in late-2018, I started to convert our old
content to Markdown and essentially haven't looked back since.

*Did it take a while for you to accept Markdown's limitations? Was there
a turning point for you? Did you look for a Markdown plugin on WordPress
to help after making the change? I imagine there's something like that
out there.*

There are third-party plugins, yes, but I believe the new WordPress
editor now supports
‚Äúhttps://wordpress.com/support/wordpress-editor/blocks/markdown-block/[markdown
blocks],‚Äù which is sortof handy for those who want to continue in that
direction. The turning point was probably when we ran out of money and
lost our account with our hosting provider. I was left with an old
external HD full of old backups and an empty domain. I'd already started
moving that direction within WordPress (largely because of the
https://wptavern.com/wordpress-core-editor-team-publishes-ui-prototype-for-gutenberg-an-experimental-block-based-editor[Gutenberg
editor project],) but losing the site in its entirety was what I really
needed to push us into a more modern, progressive CMS. Honestly,
Markdown is capable of everything we _actually_ need and nothing more.
I'd like to think I was able to realize this from the beginning.

*So you're left with an old external HD full of old backups and an empty
domain. Talk to me about the process then of finding that modern,
progressive CMS. Did you have a vague idea of what you were looking for?
I imagine getting those backups ready for whatever you were going to
choose as another process entirely.*

I actually decided to ditch the backups and just move forward with a
different Editorial direction (the project has since been more or less
put on hiatus.) I knew Markdown had to be involved and that I never
wanted to look at anything like WordPress' dashboard ever again. I
played around with a local Ghost instance but just didn't _feel_
anything for it, if that makes sense. I'd already moved my
http://bilge.world[personal blog] to Write.As months before and
eventually realized that it was just what http://extratone[_Extratone_]
needed ‚Äì so far, I've only imported my own contributions and the most
recent work from others.

*Could you explain what you mean by _feeling_ something for a piece of
software? I noticed this in your
https://bilge.world/poweruser-tips-software-shortcuts[recent post] on
your personal blog and what I enjoyed about it so much. There's an
enthusiasm about the software you do recommend that jumps through the
screen. I want to use https://bear.app/[Bear] after reading your post.*

I'm glad to hear that! I suppose it dates back to my upbringing on a
farm in rural Missouri, where I felt a real affection for ‚Äì and
attachment to ‚Äì our tractors, combine, and such. When one cares about
their work, I think it's inevitable for them to be emotionally invested
in the tools they use to accomplish it every day. During my brief stint
in IT in the beginning of 2019, I saw a lot of users struggling with
outdated and ridiculously unintuitive software throughout their entire
workday and it made me really appreciate the idea of ‚Äúgood workflow.‚Äù
I'm not really a developer, but I believe software can always be better
because I've seen it. As an End User of sorts with not much cash, I feel
like my main contribution back to developers should be celebrating their
good work. This is an idea I feel I do not encounter enough in
day-to-day life.

*As someone who also had a brief stint in IT, I totally agree with the
struggles people go through because of outdated & unintuitive software.
But IT also made me realize how much of software is personal ‚Äî someone
will want a solution that's unintuitive to you but is intuitive to them.
You learn a lot of empathy from that.*

*I am intrigued by your last point there ‚Äî why don't you think you
encounter the idea of celebrating software developers enough in
day-to-day life?*

I suppose specifically I mean I don't see enough celebration of _good_
development. It's hard to challenge the personal workflow of anyone,
yes, but I hope folks will continue to want to better their lives with
new solutions. As I mentioned in my Tips post, Microsoft Word is a great
specific example of software that simply
https://slate.com/technology/2012/04/microsoft-word-is-cumbersome-inefficient-and-obsolete-its-time-for-it-to-die.html[_should
not_ be used anymore] ‚Äì especially in composition for The Web. Not that
Word is _celebrated_, necessarily, but *its alternatives are not*. It
should be noted that I have no specific authority in this matter other
than years of experience with ‚Äì and enjoyment of ‚Äì playing around with
software. I just think that End Users deserve better than they get, and
awareness of new/different software is a huge part of the problem.
Making average people aware of better solutions should be the primary
function of special interest tech journalism, IMO.

*Great point about Microsoft Word. I don't even remember the last time I
seriously used it ‚Äî high school maybe? And like you said, discovery can
be an issue to the adoption of these alternative tools. So are there any
common patterns you've noticed as to how you've come about these
software alternatives that you now use? Patterns that someone could
adopt?*

It's not that I slave away, but it does take a lot of time to discover
them. The simple answer is: I drink a lot of caffeine and hyperfixate on
the internet. I'm not sure it's something the average user should _want_
to adopt, but if they do, they should be http://joinmastodon.org[on
Mastodon]. They should be googling ‚Äúalternatives to...‚Äù regularly, and
they should worship Free and Open Source Software. Accepting that you
never have to settle for one piece of software is probably the
beginning. For lack of a better term, I just love _playing around_ with
software. That's not something I would advocate for my old clients or
other End Users ‚Äì I would rather find out myself and then present a list
of alternatives in an entertaining way. I hope that's an appropriate and
sufficient answer hehe.

*No that's great! The acceptance of never having to settle for one piece
of software is at once valuable and challenging to adopt. If you keep
switching you could be a sort of software vagabond who throws their data
into a rucksack to head to the next viable platform. I've always had
trouble trying to find the proper balance between playing around with
software & learning a tool well enough that it can be useful. How have
you personally navigated that? I could imagine your foray into & out of
Wordpress as an example.*

It's always a challenge when trying new things. I obsess over different
ways to accomplish tasks. I've probably signed _Extratone_ for 15
different newsletter services (including
http://buttondown.email[Buttondown] today) though I haven't actually
written a single edition of our newsletter in nearly two years. I think
it's only recently that I've been able to look at these habits from a
reasonable perspective. As in, I am now able to finally differentiate
between playing and being productive, but it took some 15 years.
Self-awareness of one's actual progress is key. Asking questions like
_why am I actually doing this ‚Äì for profit or for play?_ Differentiating
between these two is something someone like me will always struggle
with, I think.

*The distinction between playing and being productive can be quite
blurry. I sometimes find that playing around with a piece of software
can lead to a productive use of it. How about you? Did you start with
the idea of creating _Extratone_ first and then tried to find the right
software to fit the job? Or did you start playing around with Wordpress
and then the idea of the digital publication took form soon after?*

That's an insightful supposition. I actually tried to launch an online
magazine before _Extratone_ with virtually zero editorial focus along
with a standalone podcast that I'd been hosting on WordPress for years.
I originally began playing around with WordPress sites in my early
adolescence, so you could say it all culminated in the idea. It took
maturity to realize that I actually wanted to build a platform for
_other_ voices rather than continue to invest in my own. I'd like to
believe that was all enabled by the playing hehe.

*So what lead you to the conclusion of building a platform for other
voices? Especially curious from the _maturity_ angle. Because you still
have a https://bilge.world/[personal blog], so it doesn't feel like
you've completely neglected your personal voice. But would you consider
that as not the same investment of time & effort that you'd put into
something like _Extratone_?*

I should be clear that I have _not_ accomplished what I set out to do
with _Extratone_. After a fairly big personal trauma in 2015, I had a
bit of an existential crisis and realized that I had surrounded myself
with so many talented (in a particularly relevant way) online friends
who were producing all sorts of incredible content ‚Äì music and videos,
mostly. I realized that I was better at editing and other platform
duties than I was at writing, and that perhaps the online communities I
was astride could be provided a single banner to give themselves. In
that sense, I haven't figured out how to do what I set out to yet.
Ideally, my byline would be completely gone from _Extratone_, so I've
more or less put it on hold until I figure out how to accomplish that.
Turning it into a somewhat profitable media company is still my biggest
long-term life goal.

*The curatorial characteristic you describe is underrated, even though
the ‚Äúeveryone is a curator‚Äù idea is jammed down our throats all the
time. There's something about this curation on a person-to-person level
that still has lots of room for experimentation. On that subject, do you
have any examples of communities, sites, or models that guide where
you'd want _Extratone_ to go?*

My citable aspirations in that regard have been somewhat superficial,
I'm afraid. From a technical perspective, I really admired what Joshua
Topolsky was
https://www.niemanlab.org/2016/08/newsonomics-sketching-in-the-details-of-josh-topolskys-new-outline/[trying
to do] with http://theoutline.com[_The Outline_] ‚Äì which just
https://www.niemanlab.org/2020/04/the-outline-an-attempt-to-build-a-bolder-kind-of-news-site-appears-to-have-met-its-end/[closed
this month], actually. They built their own CMS including a bespoke
advertising delivery platform which really looked _great_ but they just
https://www.niemanlab.org/2018/10/the-outline-built-itself-on-being-weird-but-is-it-weird-enough-to-survive/[couldn't
figure out] a sustainable editorial focus. In my fantasy world, I have
the connections and digital media insight of Topolsky and know how to
apply them in a way that supports _our_ community because I don't see
any one brand popping up any substantial umbrellas over the electronic
musicians I know. (It wasn't until ‚Äútoo late‚Äù that I realized
_Extratone_'s sole editorial focus should have been electronic music all
along.) I read a lot about media but I'm pretty picky as far as hero
worship goes when it comes to my own professional goals. I once promised
that _Extratone_ would _never_ run ads, so I could see some sort of
non-profit classification working out in our future. I believe I could
be an excellent curator ‚Äì I'm just not quite sure how to get there yet.

*I think you're a great curator ‚Äî had to ask that question of influence
because I think you have a unique curatorial presence on the web. Just
saw you tweet about https://www.tractordata.com/[tractordata.com]. Who
else would recommend that? Love it. That's why I thought
https://are.na/[Are.na] would be right up your alley.*

*So you emphasized ‚Äú_our_ community‚Äù there ‚Äî what do you define as your
community in that broader context?*

Well thank you! That's a question I'm still struggling to define.
*Electronic music* is about as far as I've gotten. I met most of my
talented friends on Twitter over the past 10 years or so and have tried
to contain them in a
https://twitter.com/i/lists/1032269790616858625[list] before. There are
innate challenges in defining such a creative community ‚Äì I have done my
best to label without being constricting, but it's definitely difficult
trying to figure out how to provide a flag which everyone feels
comfortable flying. I still think the best I've done to articulate what
I'm trying to say was for https://extratone.com/about[_Extratone_'s
About page]. Most of the folks I'm talking about are used to hustling
their own brand so it's been a real challenge working on the right way
to reach out.

*A flag which everyone feels comfortable flying ‚Äî that's a great way to
put it. What I find interesting about your internet presence is that you
defy the idea of flying just a single flag. Along with _Extratone_ you
have https://anchor.fm/extratone[multiple]
https://anchor.fm/davidblue[podcasts], https://bilge.world/[multiple]
https://dieselgoth.com/[blogs], and now you're starting a
https://mstd.racing/[Motorsports & Tech dedicated Mastodon instance].*

*I've been thinking a lot lately about how important it is to have many
online buckets to put your ideas in. One just feels too limiting,
especially if it's solely linked to your legal identity. How do you
think about this matter of identity & expression with your own online
presence?*

That's a very good question. I can't take credit for
https://mastd.racing[mastd.racing], actually ‚Äì I'm not sure who created
that server but it's administered by an account called
https://mastd.racing/@RaceControl[RaceControl]. You've arrived at
another one of my biggest challenges. Consolidating my interests has
always been a problem, especially on The Web. Age has definitely helped
narrow them down a bit, but I still can't help myself sometimes. I think
it's ended up alienating a lot of my followers on social because I have
a hard time posting just within my niche(s). I'm not so sure how to feel
about this, honestly. One could argue that I should post whatever I
want, whenever, but _consider your audience_ is also a concept I can no
longer ignore. If anything, I need to learn to let myself be limited a
bit _more_ by those buckets. Once again, _Extratone_ is a good example
of this ‚Äì I should've never published app reviews there, but I did.
We're all learning, I suppose.

*Do you feel like you have to even learn to limit yourself on your
https://bilge.world/[personal blog]? It seems like a personal blog can
act as the release valve ‚Äî a way of getting around cornering yourself
into the niches that _Extratone_ and other projects require. You can
freely write about
https://bilge.world/preferred-writing-instruments[pens] and
https://bilge.world/star-trek-picard-review[Picard] without feeling
constrained to a single subject.*

I think I'm just now coming around to understanding personal blogging
and the freedom that entails. It's been a long while since I've had the
urge to write about things on which I don't consider myself at least
somewhat of an authority. I think ‚Äì like many people ‚Äì I originally just
used my personal blog as a guinea pig for messing around with themes,
and I'm just now actually catching up on some of the lesser items on my
‚Äúto-write‚Äù list. Since we've begun talking I've begun building my blogs
bookmark folder back up and following the
https://100daystooffload.com/[]https://bilge.world/tag:100DaystoOffload[#[.p-category]##100DaystoOffload##]
challenge, which I find immensely impressive. I can't say I'm quite up
to it, personally, but I definitely plan on opening up the taps a bit
more. (I also don't want to flood https://read.write.as/[read.write.as]
with too many joke posts ya know hehe.)

*That's awesome! You're reminding me of the interesting relationship
between writing & tinkering when it comes to blogs. They both feed into
each other in a strange way. Before, when my blog was on Wordpress, I
didn't care about tinkering around ‚Äî writing was my sole focus. When I
moved to my new blog, however, I found myself shift towards creating
apps that extend my blog and messing around with its CSS. So it's
interesting that you've gone the opposite way, publishing more instead
of solely tinkering.*

*What has awoken the urge for you to tackle those items on your personal
‚Äúto-write‚Äù list? To open up those taps a bit more? Because I can see the
publication mindset, being somewhat of an authority, getting in the
way.*

That is interesting. I'm wondering how many people are in each of our
camps. I hate to be so topical, but the pandemic and being home
constantly has definitely contributed. I've also begun to learn to let
things go, which is an essential skill. Being able to actually kill work
when it needs to die is the real secret. I just built up the strength to
delete the rest of my 2019 list a few weeks ago.

*I wonder also! And hey, no problem bringing up the current situation. I
think it's making me write more also.*

*Want to drill into that practice of letting go as an essential skill
for blogging. As a final question for this chat, how have you gone about
the decision of keeping ideas that you've had for a long time and when
to let them go? It's been something I've been struggling with for
recently as ideas for blog posts start to pile up.*

Self-curation is definitely tough. Generally, it's very hard to let
things go ‚Äì especially when I've progressed at all significantly into
research/first drafting, but I know when to kill something if I reread
and am unable to immediately see where I was going. I've noticed that
trying to rekindle interest or momentum in a topic is unusually not a
worthwhile use of time in my case. If I can't get my rhythm back fairly
early in, I am very unlikely to, ever. That said, I think it's also
important to _forgive yourself_ for investing time in something that
won't work out ‚Äì otherwise, you will settle for less than what you
originally intended and release something you won't be happy with.

Thank you so much for your time! I really enjoyed this!

*Forgive and forget! That's a great point about rekindling an interest
being a sign of letting go of an idea. I've done that too many times.
This has been a blast to chat virtually David ‚Äî really enjoyed your
thoughts and am looking forward to future blog posts and installments of
_Extratone_!*

[[section0081.xhtml#discovery-is-pushing-boundaries-but-for-what-purpose]]
=== Discovery is pushing boundaries, but for what purpose?

_Discovery_ may no longer be new ‚Äì not even the newest _Star Trek_
property ‚Äì but it _is_ new to me. According to the
https://web.archive.org/web/20091227080806/http:/www.mtv.com/movies/news/articles/1611063/20090511/story.jhtml[alternate
timeline exemption] of the J.J. movies, I've been left without ‚ÄúCanon‚Äù
_Star Trek_ television since 2005 (or 2155) with the last episode of
_Enterprise_, but I've been looking forward with moderate anticipation
to an opportunity to watch this new entry into
‚Äúhttps://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/in-star-trek-discovery-the-future-is-a-simpler-time[the
stodgiest and squarest of all sci-fi universes].‚Äù Though I am extremely
well-versed in Gene Roddenberry's baby, I come to both you and
_Discovery_ with absolutely zero desire to analyze whether or not it is
‚ÄúTrek‚Äù enough, ‚Äúgood‚Äù science-fiction, or even ‚Äúgood‚Äù television ‚Äì I'd
like only to land on your screen between all of these institutions and
their proctors in some unique insight from all of them, without the
clich√©s, cringey jokes, or unnecessary __Trek__ism. What I will strive
to do is perform https://extratone.com/solo-star-wars-film-review[my
Special Duty] in relation to American intellectual property mastodons
for which I have my own adoration: to determine whether or not
https://extratone.com/star-wars-the-force-awakens-review[they should
die]. I know absolutely _nothing_ about television writing ‚Äì the same
amount I know https://extratone.com/tag:film[about film] ‚Äì so I hope I
can provide something usefully unique.

I would rather _Star Trek_ *not* have to die, but I wouldn‚Äôt be
surprised if it‚Äôs necessary. Without sounding like I have to prove
myself, know that the property ‚Äì in particular the history of _Star Trek
Online_‚Äôs development ‚Äì was a very important part of my adolescent life.
I have watched every episode of every series several times at least, but
I know better than to entrust my entire emotional existence into the
promise of a continuation like _Discovery_. It most fascinates me how
revivals of old names like this go about contextualizing their dialogue
and other elements for today‚Äôs audience.
‚Äúhttps://subslikescript.com/series/Star_Trek_Discovery-5171438/season-1/episode-3-Context_is_for_Kings[Snug
as a bug in a rug]‚Äù is surely not an expression we should expect to
survive the next 250 years of human development, and yet this is
supposed to be an aspirational series? It even made it in the recap! I
should confess now: it is actually _Star Trek Online_ which made me
curious enough to seek out a CBS All Access Free Trial. The marketing
worked very well.

image:xhtml/https:/i.snap.as/4Wgb1i1.png[The Measure of Morality]

I tend to install the game for a few weeks or so around this time every
year just to check in. This time, I was greeted by
https://www.pcgamer.com/star-trek-onlines-legacy-update-lets-you-live-your-star-trek-picard-dreams/[_Star
Trek Online: Legacy_] ‚Äì a new expansion featuring _Voyager_‚Äôs Jeri Ryan
and _Discovery_‚Äôs Sonequa Martin-Green reprising their respective
characters in voiceover roles. I figured out that Michael Burnham must
have been from The New Show fairly quickly, but I was disappointed to
find out that the character was not in fact a trans man, but rather a
female character with an unusually male name. For the most part, Burnham
is simply an outlier in _The Measure of Morality_ Parts
https://sto.gamepedia.com/Mission:_The_Measure_of_Morality_(Part_1)[I]
and
https://sto.gamepedia.com/Mission:_The_Measure_of_Morality_(Part_2)[II].
She accompanies one‚Äôs character (along with Seven of Nine) to several
different battlegrounds and stories we‚Äôd already seen before in previous
episodes ‚Äì _when the budget‚Äôs running low, reuse sets_, but there is one
instance where _we_ are brought into _her_ (_Discovery_‚Äôs) world, which
feels disorienting. The whole experience plays like it was forced upon
STO by CBS in order to squeeze as many viewers into our free CBS All
Access trials with as little developmental investment into the game as
possible. Well, here I am!

In Season 1, Episode 4 of _Discovery_, the writers made a
https://www.geekwire.com/2017/star-trek-discovery-elon-musk/[very foul
mistake]‚Ä¶ They placed fucking Elon Musk‚Äôs name alongside the aviation
pioneering Wright Brothers and the fictional inventor of warp drive,
Zefram Cochrane.

How do you want to be remembered in history? Alongside the Wright
Brothers, Elon Musk, Zefram Cochrane? Or as a failed fungus expert?

I can‚Äôt be timid about this ‚Äì it straight up makes me _ill_. I can
_guarantee_ you that Orville and Wilbur Wright would have _never_

If _Discovery_ was ‚Äúmaking history,‚Äù I‚Äôm not so sure what
https://bilge.world/star-trek-picard-review[_Star Trek: Picard_] was
doing with _fucking_ and _pissant_. I‚Äôm also not sure it matters at all
in the grander scheme. What other freedoms should CBS feel free to
explore, now that they‚Äôve said the bad words? What else hasn‚Äôt been
explored? Bathrooms? Shitting and farting? That has my vote. I really
don‚Äôt remember as many colloquialisms showing up in the earlier series,
but perhaps that‚Äôs just because those colloquialisms have since become
part of our language. I‚Äôm not the greatest television watcher of all
time, but I got lost in _Discovery_‚Äôs plot, and apparently I‚Äôm

____
There turned out to be too many of those twists in Discovery‚Äôs first
season, and it was frustrating to watch as the writers sidled up to new,
risky frontiers for exploration, only to suddenly change course right
when things were starting to get interesting.

to Make the Sanest Man Go Mad],‚Äù and it‚Äôs the most classically _Star
Trek_ of what I‚Äôve seen. One of those stuck-in-a-time-loop stories which
truly makes you want to die. What‚Äôs even better and slightly meta:
playback kept resetting for me at exactly 21:26 and starting from the
beginning while the cat kept stepping on the delete key and destroying
this paragraph. I had to keep watching the man from _The_ Fucking
_Office_ continually kill the captain after the crew parties to
250-year-old West Coast hip hop and _300_-year old Al Green all whilst
writing this over again. I do not like Rainn Wilson invading my _Star
Trek_. He gives Aquariuses a bad name and‚Ä¶ beard. ‚ÄúListen, petunia, I've
been screwed over since the day I was born. I deserve this,‚Äù he says,
and I wonder if in fact it is Rainn himself speaking of his invasion. He
looks and sounds like a fucking incel. All of this makes me wonder if my
entire problem with this show is simply that I do not particularly like
its characters.

There is also _a lot_ of combat, though _Discovery_ seems to have struck
a healthy balance between warfare and other intrigues. It is definitely
_Trek_ in many ways: redshirts die without any plot consequence and all
the classic character flaw tropes are represented. There is the

There‚Äôs a reason we all hate Captain Lorca, and why he says things like
‚Äúhttps://subslikescript.com/series/Star_Trek_Discovery-5171438/season-1/episode-11-The_Wolf_Inside[sometimes

‚Äúhttps://subslikescript.com/series/Star_Trek_Discovery-5171438/season-1/episode-10-Despite_Yourself[there‚Äôs
no way we‚Äôre asking _these_ neighbors for a cup of sugar].‚Äù I do not
believe in Spoilers, but there‚Äôs not much reason for me to tell you why,
specifically. Perhaps it is racist and/or misogynist to say so, but I
found it difficult to get as attached to _Discovery_‚Äôs characters as I
have to those of series past. Michael is great, of course, though my
girlfriend Sierra surmised that her purpose in the show is to illustrate
that ‚Äúnobody listens to black women.‚Äù Sierra was also quite aggravated
by the misunderstanding and mistreatment of the tardigrade. When Paul
Stamets mentioned that his uncle Everett participated in a Beatles cover
band, we both despaired, for we discovered an entry in _Memory Alpha_
for ‚Äúhttps://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/The_Beatles[The Beatles].‚Äù If
I were to standardize a system of measurement for my television ratings,
_Discovery_‚Äôs *cringe factor* would be 9/10. The holodeck hasn‚Äôt been
invented yet!

Also, CBS All Access‚Äô user interface is the worst I‚Äôve ever seen from a
streaming service, across iOS, desktop browser, and my Samsung
television. It‚Äôs impossible to scrub, really, or to dictate a preference
for high definition. One cannot navigate backward between episodes
without re-searching the title and navigating through an incredibly
clunky menu sequence. I was able to cast to both my Samsung TV and
Sierra‚Äôs Chromecast from my iPhone, at least.

[[section0081.xhtml#compliments]]
=== Compliments

Despite its failings (including Rainn Wilson,) _Discovery_‚Äôs acting is
superb.
https://www.startrek.com/article/james-frain-joins-discovery-as-sarek[James
Frain as Sarek], especially, is the best of the three. I thought it was
especially thoughtful that for the most part (at least in Season 1,) the
Klingons _actually spoke Klingon_ to each other. Given that
https://www.kli.org/about-klingon/klingon-history/[Dr. Marc Okrand]
spent the time and effort to construct a fully-functional Klingon
language, it seems only reasonable to include as much of it as possible.
I also love https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Hugh_Culber[Hugh
Culber]‚Äôs doctor‚Äôs uniform and the ‚Äúcinematic‚Äù cinematography of the
whole thing. It‚Äôs very much an action show, yet not quite obnoxious.

So, *should *Star Trek* die*? Perhaps it shows my extreme bias, but no,
I do not think it need perish quite yet. From my (white, male, cishet)
perspective, _Discovery_ does an okay job at remaining thoroughly _Trek_
whilst
https://www.newyorker.com/tech/annals-of-technology/for-alt-right-trolls-star-trek-discovery-is-an-unsafe-space[acknowledging

enterprise and wholesomely cringey generation X cultural mastodon, but I
think it‚Äôs still worth our time.

Though I grew up on a farm surrounded by (and loving) diesel equipment,
owning a diesel-powered automobile somehow never occurred to me. This is
especially puzzling given the overwhelmingly positive experience I was
privileged to have with one 2014 Volkswagen Jetta TDI Sportwagen over
the past year. It would find me signing up to Facebook groups, using
real Fast Boy terms, revisiting long-lost roads of home, and returning
to my local community in an extremely intimate ridesharing stint.
Throughout it all, the Jetta made me smile much _much_ more than I
would‚Äôve thought. I found a real love for this relatively simpleton form
of transportation that I _should_ have seen coming, but did not at all.
There is something delightfully indulgent about a manual-equipped diesel
wagon. Even
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/20/automobiles/autoreviews/diesel-wagon-whatll-they-think-of-next.html[_The
New York Times_] knows this:

____
Auto writers have long tooted the horn about the benefits of diesel
engines, and a bunch of them have also argued that the old-school
station wagon is a far more efficient way to haul things around than a
bloated high-set S.U.V.
____

I knew it, too, apparently, long before I actually decided to act on a
purchase. On October 24th, 2012, I Tweeted
‚Äúhttps://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/261163556073005056[I sat in a Jetta
wagon today. I need one].‚Äù I really did intend on becoming The Jetta Man
(perhaps without the fashion.) In acquiring it, my plan ‚Äì and it was a
good plan ‚Äì was to cease an era of general insensibility in my life's
decisions by entombing my wayward self within the most sensible
expression of modern automotive design I suspected I could live with.
The wagon component joined with diesel power and a manual transmission
upon casual research. Diesel, manual, wagon ‚Äì of the people's car, these
I sought. Nay, _demanded_.

An ex-girlfriend of mine drove an utterly decimated Mk. V Jetta Sedan
which she‚Äôd acquired in some sort of dicey deal. I remember finding it
surprisingly robust given its lot, and quite dynamic to drive. We
traveled all over the Midwest in it ‚Äì from central Missouri to Des
Moines to Chicago to Kansas City and back again. I mocked, but it was
everything one could hope for in cheap transportation and quite a bit
more. It turns out, Volkswagen was shooting high. As Tony Quiroga
https://www.caranddriver.com/reviews/a15129377/volkswagen-jetta-review-2011-volkswagen-jetta-first-drive/[recalls
for _Car & Driver_]:

____
During the press launch of the outgoing Jetta back in 2005, Volkswagen
touted that car as a less expensive alternative to an Acura TSX or Volvo
S40. Volkswagen pointed to its growth in size, high-quality interior,
new rear suspension, and refined demeanor as evidence that the Jetta had
moved out of the Honda Civic and Toyota Corolla class.
____

In terms of *premium* compacts, my experience is quite limited, but it‚Äôs
no wonder the company has struggled to find a place in the market for
this product: in German, ‚ÄúVolkswagen Jetta‚Äù literally means
‚Äúhttps://www.roadandtrack.com/car-culture/a24487598/volkswagen-golf-jetta-passat-polo-name-origin/[people‚Äôs
car jet stream].‚Äù The first component is infamous, of course, because of
the Nazis and their
https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/volkswagen-is-founded[horrid
Beetle], but the second seems to be almost entirely unknown. In my
research, I had to specifically investigate the Jetta‚Äôs name before
reading anything about it. When an American thinks of ‚ÄúJetta,‚Äù they
unconsciously dissociate the word from the ‚Äújet‚Äù sound and make
https://carstereotypes.com/car-stereotypes/volkswagen-jetta-stereotypes/[largely
unsophisticated jokes]. (It‚Äôs also _Regular Car Reviews_‚Äô
https://youtu.be/2KZb545b4MU[most hated car].) Now, the name has become
a marque in and of itself: in China, Volkswagen
https://www.volkswagen-newsroom.com/en/press-releases/jetta-brand-successfully-launched-in-chinese-market-5647[began
selling several different models] under the JETTA brand last year. This
also was news to me, and _I_ try to keep up with the industry.

In 2011, the Mk. VI Jetta was
https://www.motortrend.com/cars/volkswagen/jetta/2011/2011-volkswagen-jetta/[released]
with an outdated base, 115-hp powertrain and a ‚Äúhard plastic [interior]
that wouldn‚Äôt look out of place in a Chrysler Sebring.‚Äù (Quiroga
insults, to clarify.) Compared to the Mk. V, ‚ÄúVolkswagen made it clear
that the targets are once again the strong-selling Civic and Corolla.‚Äù
Once again, I‚Äôm at a loss for experience in the equivalent
extra-Volkswagen competition, save for the
https://youtu.be/40x4TF-6ggc[Chevrolet Cruze] and Kia Forte.
(Surprisingly, GM actually produced a diesel version of the Cruze and
https://youtu.be/dH-FZyKTY3s[_AutoGuide_ compared it against the Jetta
TDI].) It‚Äôs been too long since I last drove my ex‚Äôs Mk. V to really
have much to say, but I do remember a particular solidity about the
steering ‚Äì perhaps because it was still hydraulic. Once again, I‚Äôll rely
on Tony:

____
Less obvious cost cutting includes the loss of adjustability for the
center armrest, a lack of lumbar adjustment in most models, no more
power-reclining seatbacks, and a simpler stability-control program that
can no longer be shut off or even reduced.
____

When I began searching for my first ever truly modern car in February
2019, I surprisingly only needed to pass up a single option in the
Kansas City area before I found The One: a 2014
post-https://youtu.be/SvokGhOaHGg[Dieselgate] example with ~65,000 miles
on its odometer in ‚ÄúDeep Black Pearl‚Äù with a ‚ÄúCornsilk Beige‚Äù interior
which had been previously owned only by a single Michigan cyclist. I‚Äôd
been without a car since dailying/living in a
https://www.instagram.com/p/BiYABpKAJQX[1976 Lincoln Continental] the
year before, in Portland, and my friend had driven me around everywhere
in his Wrangler for a full month (thanks, Jack!) I‚Äôd walked around and
cold-idled another, high-mileage Sportwagen, but I was committed to
getting something with a light-colored interior after the red velvet
cake Lincoln and my dank smoking room-dark XJR.

image:xhtml/https:/i.snap.as/HRE2hlh.jpg[Martin Racing]

Three of us walked into a dealership in the middle of a frigid Kansas
afternoon ‚Äì Jack, my girlfriend Sierra, and I. We hovered by a smart,
gleaming little Golf GTI whilst my salesman, Charles, retrieved the car
I had found online. After he finished copying my driver‚Äôs license while
the little diesel warmed up, the four of us set off into suburban
Lawrence. Back when the Mk. VI Golf was released, I attended a
Volkswagen dealership event in which Mk. V and Mk. VI GTIs were driven
back-to-back ‚Äì I‚Äôm assuming to reassure buyers that yes, they _really
had_ made it better (though I was quite vocal in my disagreement about
this, to the dealer‚Äôs chagrin.) The car I bought immediately reminded me
more of the former ‚Äì perhaps I just enjoy the increased body roll of a
50,000+ mile suspension ‚Äì albeit with a much longer wheelbase and
significantly more torque. Rowing through the gears, I was immediately
impressed and bewildered by the characteristics of the 140-horsepower,
236 lb.-ft.-developing diesel powerplant. The diesel engines I grew up
around in tractors, combines, and other heavy machinery were designed to
more or less remain at a constant, relatively low RPM for the majority
of their use cases. It‚Äôs not a screamer, but the idea that a diesel
engine can _rev_ at all was something that took a bit to wrap my head
around. However, it is almost immediately evident that carrying on to
the 6000 RPM (?) redline is a futile and incorrect practice. There is
nothing at all to be found up there.

I‚Äôve driven some quick straight-line cars in my time, but none of them
have delivered their power anything like the Jetta‚Äôs long-distinguished
2.0L inline-four. It‚Äôs very odd having comparatively so little actual
horsepower, yet so much torque ‚Äì I‚Äôd heard Jeremy Clarkson complain
about diesel power coming in ‚Äúgreat lumps,‚Äù but I‚Äôd already started to
find them extremely (and positively) amusing in my first few minutes.
When asked, the oil burner will produce protracted front tire squeal and
torque steer from a stop, which is odd and hilarious coming from such an
otherwise docile automobile. Also hilarious: Charles likely noted that
Jack, Sierra, and I were (and are) entirely unafraid of facing The End
when a very near collision during our test drive did not perturb us in
the least, but left him huffing and puffing from adrenaline. He was a
star, though, throughout the more than four hours of deliberations
required for his institution to reckon with my credit history.
Eventually, I ended up spending almost exactly $12,000, which was
probably too much, and named my new automobile Martin ‚Äì ‚ÄúMarty‚Äù for
short ‚Äì after Martin Winterkorn, the former CEO of Volkswagen AG who
https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-05-03/ex-vw-ceo-winterkorn-charged-by-u-s-in-diesel-cheating-case[bore
more than his share of the blame] for Dieselgate, including
https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/16/18369528/vw-ceo-martin-winterkorn-dieselgate-germany-volkswagen-emissions-scandal[charges

spec, 236 lb.-ft. of it arrived between 1750-2800 RPM, but my

My own views on Dieselgate are entirely irrelevant, but I will note that
buying back a buyback car for such a price felt like a favor to my
dealer and that it‚Äôs pretty cool to have my own copy of
https://www.vwdiesellookup.com/pdf/VWCourtSettlement_Emissions_Disclosure_Gen2_Automatic_Final.pdf[VW‚Äôs
Extended Emissions Warranty Notice], not to mention the fact that I
actually made use of it (which I will discuss later.) From my
perspective, the automotive industry is _the_ most heavily-regulated
business space in the world and I‚Äôd suggest a company like the
Volkswagen Group feeling like they should cheat on emissions testing
might indicate that the standards of the test could be unreasonable
and/or unrealistic.

After returning from almost two hellish, extremely confusing years in
Portland taking public transport, Martin became a vehicle for a
rediscovery and newfound appreciation for my Missouri home ‚Äì the great
Missouri River, especially. Not since owning my Miata had I driven so
much in the country. Sierra and I

Somewhere North of Kansas City, I opened the taps all the way on a very
long straight and reached 125mph, which is either the aerodynamic VMax,
an electronically limited limit, or both. Surprisingly, the modern
People‚Äôs Car feels quite stable at this speed ‚Äì were it not my own
automobile, I‚Äôm not sure I wouldn‚Äôt just travel this fast everywhere. In
the past few years, Interstate 70 ‚Äì which cuts Missouri just about in
half from West-East, connecting St. Louis and Kansas City with my
hometown in the center ‚Äì has become significantly faster-paced than I
remembered it before moving to Portland for two years. 80mph used to be
the accepted number, 70 (the actual speed limit) was the unenforced
minimum. In my old Toyota pickup, I could travel at 65 without
attracting too much criticism. _Now_, however, one must maintain 85 to
keep up with traffic, especially when traveling with commuters. 90-95
will no longer garner judgmental looks and 100mph left-laners are given
a pass.

‚ÄúI‚Äôll bet that‚Äôs great on the highway‚Äù is probably the most regular
comment received from passersby and riders right after ‚Äúis this a
diesel!?‚Äù (Really, the fact of my Jetta‚Äôs existence as a manual-equipped
diesel wagon seemed to utterly astound a great many people.) There is
truth in this general supposition: the ability of the diesel powerplant
to deliver hill-climbing torque at low RPM is simply unmatched by
gasoline powerplants of the same displacement, which means that
‚Äúhighway‚Äù driving entails virtually zero downshifting ‚Äì arrive in sixth
gear, set the cruise control, take a nap. Everything else is taken care
of. There is a definite luxury in the knowledge that one is no longer
needed in the process at speed ‚Äì luxury that is NOT present in a
gasoline-to-manual Jetta drivetrain. From

[Diesel] has a higher volumetric energy density than gasoline, and

‚ÄúDiesel engines are typically poor when it comes to power to weight
ratio, as their high compression ratio and torque output demands heavier
materials in their construction,‚Äù notes Lewin Day, meaning _steel_
engine block. Here we arrive on my singular dissatisfaction with the
Jetta: *its weight*. While traveling from Kansas City back home in the
East one day, I decided to satisfy a longtime bucketlist item and stop
by a weigh station. As I drove up to the scale, the police-uniformed
attendant looked up at me from his glass box and gave
https://twitter.com/rashadpls/status/650114296937058304[the standard
white guy smile frown]. It took a moment for the scale to register
Martin, but it eventually displayed a whole *3440* *lbs*. My little
‚Äúcompact‚Äù wagon‚Ä¶ weighed significantly more than one and three-quarter
tons ‚Äì just 528 lbs. less than the
https://www.instagram.com/p/BJPe6rWAcnr/[full-sized, supercharged
V8-powered Jaguar saloon car] I call the automotive love of my life, and
almost a full 200 lbs. more than
https://www.caranddriver.com/reviews/a15129379/2011-volkswagen-jetta-gli-20-tsi-review/[its
GLI sedan sibling]. There was one single advantage to this weight: we
were able to use Martin as a ballast to help
https://www.instagram.com/tv/BwBEetwlUEF[re-spool the winch cable on

After discovering this figure, I did what I could to diminish the weight
easily without tearing into the seats or removing some of the car‚Äôs
_fourteen_ airbags. Upon lifting up the base of the ‚Äúcar-go‚Äù area in the
rear, I found a _full_ steel spare wheel ‚Äì some 30 lbs of it at least ‚Äì
which I immediately removed, along with some sort of flapping cargo
restraint that I can only suspect was designed to keep objects (like
dogs, perhaps) in the cargo area from sailing into the passenger
compartment during an accident (it‚Äôs called the ‚Äúluggage compartment
cover‚Äù in the

manual].) Ideally, I intended to one day strip out all of the interior
except for the driver‚Äôs side chair, but it ‚Äòtwas not intended to be.

After driving the Jetta for about a week, I was on the short commute
back home from the office when I noticed that the cooling fans were
running at what sounded like maximum capacity. Then, at a red light, I
felt some rough dips in the engine‚Äôs idle. When I reached home minutes
later, I turned off the ignition and removed the key only to find the
fans still spooling. I was convinced I had already broken the car
somehow in rough driving, but in reality, Marty was in the process of
https://dieselnet.com/tech/dpf_regen.php[Diesel Particulate Filter (DPF)
Regeneration] ‚Äì a procedure designed to clean the little shitpot under
the hood by heating it up some thousands of degrees to burn off built up
diesel exhaust soot. At least, this is the way I understand it.

Otherwise, I disagree with most reviews about the ‚Äúdiesel rumble‚Äù being
bothersome. Perhaps it‚Äôs because this is by far the most modern car I‚Äôve
ever spent this much time with ‚Äì the _only_ car I‚Äôve ever spent so much
consecutive time with, in fact ‚Äì or because I did, indeed, grow up
sitting (and standing) right next to 8-liter turbodiesels at full chat
for hours on end. Compared to my mother‚Äôs 1.4L gasoline-powered Mk. VII
sedan at idle in her garage, there is a more pronounced clacking, but
it‚Äôs nothing you‚Äôd have any trouble sleeping through. I would know!
Whilst driving for Uber and Lyft through one of the

the (averagely effective) air-conditioning on. I idled when I wasn‚Äôt

[[section0082.xhtml#ridesharing]]
=== Ridesharing

For more than six months, my primary income was from Uber and Lyft
driving around Columbia, MO ‚Äì a distinctly academically-dominated
demographic. Frankly, I can‚Äôt think of any vehicle more suited to what
ridesharing actually entails than a diesel Jetta wagon. It‚Äôs a
relatively spacious and comfortable place to be for four adults ‚Äì
certainly when no trip lasts longer than thirty minutes ‚Äì with a
ridiculously stout cargo capacity. I was able to fit _9_ freshman
fraternity guys in for a short trip once. Their faces were all genuinely
somber as one expressed ‚Äúit‚Äôs really hard having 8 friends when we try
to go out.‚Äù (No, you‚Äôre not supposed to accept those rides.) It was a
challenge carrying some 1500 lbs. of Sad Boys, mostly for the brakes.
Once, a group of young men and women began to make fun after noticing
the DIESELGEEK decal I‚Äôd stuck on my side‚Äôs rear quarter window (which
I‚Äôd acquired with a new
https://www.dieselgeek.com/products/high-performance-vw-shifter-shaft-bushings-for-mk4-golf-jetta-new-beetle?variant=6292541866027[shifter
bushing kit].) ‚ÄúSo are you a diesel geek?‚Äù they asked, jeering to
themselves, to which I responded: ‚Äúyou know, it‚Äôs so weird you mention
that because I know this place that sells these stickers‚Ä¶‚Äù They no
longer seemed amused.

All of the cars I‚Äôve owned have been attention-grabbing in their own way
‚Äì my old Toyota pickup was adored by the locals; my Miata was adored by
other Miata owners. My XJR was gorgeous and my Swamp Continental seemed
to be passionately coveted by absolutely everyone over 40. With the
Jetta, though, I did not expect any unusual attention whatsoever, yet I
must confess that more conversations were started about it than of all
of the others, combined. Ridesharing will do that, yes, but it is
ridiculous how many people of all races, classes, and ages were enamored
by ‚Äì or overly curious about ‚Äì Martin.

____
What is this a Jetta, dude? Is this a Jetta? Whoa! Dude, is this a
stickshift!? Dude I think this is a stickshift. BRO. I can‚Äôt believe
you‚Äôre driving a stick right now. He‚Äôs driving a stickshift car! Wow I
think this is a manual car! Oh shit this is a *diesel*!? It‚Äôs a diesel
too?! No way! I can‚Äôt believe you‚Äôre out here driving a diesel Jetta
wagon bro. Is this a stickshift? You can drive stick!?
____

No.

Early one morning, a ride was requested from the local news station just
out of town ‚Äì a fascinating place. News vans parked in a converted horse
stable. They farm televisions out there. A few minutes into the ride,
after picking up the young woman, I noticed in the rearview mirror out
of my eye‚Äôs corner that she had put down her phone to watch my right
hand with total bewilderment. Eventually, she asked ‚Äúwhat are you doing
to the car?‚Äù She‚Äôd never heard of a manual transmission before. I did my
best to explain, but when she asked ‚Äúbut why wouldn‚Äôt you just buy a
regular car?‚Äù I did not have a sufficient answer. Unlike many automotive
enthusiasts, I think it‚Äôs totally okay that people are allowed to exist
independent of this knowledge. There are many, many other things in life
to worry about.
https://dieselgoth.com/automatic-transmission-inefficiency[80% of cars
sold in the United States] are shipped with automatics and expecting
every young person who lives in an urban environment to think about
automobiles as anything beyond simple transportation is asking a lot.

While we‚Äôre on the topic of manual transmissions, it‚Äôs relevant to
mention how excellent the Jetta TDI is as a vehicle to teach first
timers how to operate one. With the clutch in, the engine will not rev
beyond 3500 RPM thanks to an electronic limiter, which dramatically
reduces the number of obligatory stalls when learning clutch control.
The learner can simply hold the accelerator to the floor as they get the
hang of declutching instead of having to receive shouts of ‚Äúmore gas!‚Äù
repeatedly. Of course, being a diesel further eases those stresses with
much more readily available torque. Sierra was able to grasp the basics
this way in a _single night_, which is unprecedented in my experience.
She found particular comfort in the suggested gear indicator on the
instrument panel‚Äôs main information display, which is very conservative,
naturally, but also apparently relief from some great anxiety regarding
the question _which gear should I be in right now_?

[[section0082.xhtml#community]]
=== Community

I have derided Facebook for my entire adult life for its shitty design,
inaspirational effect on its users, and its massive intellectual power,
but strangely, through Jetta ownership, I was able to find a community
on the service that couldn‚Äôt be found elsewhere. Groups like

=== Performance

For the first time in my personal automotive history, I felt the desire
to modify one of my own cars. Perhaps the most famous appearance of the
Jetta Sportwagen in The Web Era was driving instructor Austin Cabot‚Äôs
2014 Sportwagen in https://youtu.be/x3HwWn55MJY[one of Matt Farah‚Äôs
infamous __One-Take__s]. You can find the full list of modifications on
https://www.wheelwell.com/austin-cabot/im7/2014-volkswagen-jetta-sportwagen[the
car‚Äôs _WheelWell_ page]. I intended to emulate Austin with a few
modifications including Dieselgeek‚Äôs

bushing kit] (which I did get around to buying, but never installed.)
For those interested in engine/ECU tuning, Malone Tuning has a

Instead of installing the shortshift kit right away, I decided to
splurge on a bespoke
https://www.ecstuning.com/b-raceseng-parts/ashiko-shift-knob-red-texture-no-engraving-vw-audi-adapter/08311421~rsg[Raceseng
Ashiko weighted shift knob], which made throws immediately better. The
issue these products are combatting is the particularly disconnected
gearshift which Volkswagen has been notorious for the past few decades.
The best way I can describe it is that it feels like you‚Äôre just
operating a lever instead of shifting a transmission, if that makes
sense.

realizing that I‚Äôve always hated the sound and sensation of them, but
hadn‚Äôt been willing to modify my previous cars in _any_ way. It sounds
ridiculous, but it‚Äôs actually quite personally noteworthy that I was
able to traverse the unseen boundary into _mod culture_. The result was
a slightly more mechanical-feeling shift that would‚Äôve certainly been
https://youtu.be/Rh02yxy9SbE[vastly improved] by installation of
Dieselgeek‚Äôs kit.

Another aspirational goal of mine for Martin:

Firehawk Indy 500s]. The goal was to sure up some of that body roll and
torque-induced wheelspin. I suspect the result would‚Äôve been a very,
very sticky Martin. Unfortunately, I would not get the chance before I
killed him in an accident on December 22nd of last year.

Much of the reason for diesel vehicle‚Äôs high fuel economy has to do with
the diesel combustion process; however, some of the increase in fuel
economy is due to the simple fact that a gallon of diesel fuel contains
more energy than a gallon of gasoline.

The joy my Sportwagen brought me was not expected. My plan to make
myself a more reasonable person (and driver) by buying a ‚Äúboring‚Äù car
was obviously foiled by the diesel‚Äôs torque, the community‚Äôs dynamism,
and my own communion with mod culture. I spent more consecutive time
driving the Jetta than I have in any other automobile and was able to
truly enjoy it. After my experience owning a diesel-powered Volkswagen,
I would very much like to try driving/owning the

neglected to find those focused on what I really care about: *Office

https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/19/21260005/microsoft-office-fluid-web-document-features-build[reported
by _The Verge_],
https://eileenlong-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/g/personal/david_eileenlonglcsw_com/EXd7qVaXqRlHlnnllT7_A5gBRw-ypXkANGTIWlzEPlLzQA?e=PrLfh6[Microsoft
Fluid] is going to change a lot:

____
Microsoft‚Äôs Fluid Framework sounds a lot like Google Docs, but it‚Äôs
actually Google Docs on steroids. Microsoft is so confident it has built
the future of productivity, it‚Äôs now open-sourcing its Fluid Framework
so the rest of the world can help shape what it has created.
____

There's also
https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-lists-150002899.html[Microsoft
Lists], which is reportedly going to revolutionize SharePoint Lists into
something more modern and useful:

____
It builds off the

organize your teams, potentially making the company‚Äôs offerings more
streamlined and productive.

[[section0084.xhtml#microsoft-edge-chromium]]
=== Microsoft Edge Chromium

As an Office 365 administrator, I basically only use Edge for
administrative/management tasks. Otherwise, I can't imagine a reason to
use it over Firefox, Brave, Vivaldi, Chrome, Opera, etc, but I thought
I'd give the ‚Äúnew‚Äù (as of January) Edge a tryout for your sake and make
it my default browser for a day as well as Microsoft's Bing search
engine. There's also news specific to Build:
https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/19/microsoft-edge-gets-a-pinterest-integration-sidebar-search-and-automatic-profile-switching/[Edge
is integrating with Pinterest], of all things:

____
Now, Edge will feature a Pinterest-powered tool that will show
suggestions from Pinterest at the bottom of a collection. Clicking on
that, Microsoft says, will take users to a Pinterest board ‚Äúof similar,
trending Pins so users can quickly find and add ideas relevant to their
collection.‚Äù Users will also be able to export collections to Pinterest.
____

I'm in no position to ‚Äútest‚Äù a browser, but the new Edge is noticeably
faster at rendering pages and much _much_ smoother when navigating
between tabs/preference windows. It looks much more like Chrome, which
makes sense. Perhaps because my install is absent of third-party
extensions, opening new tabs and windows was much faster than my other
browsers. I recorded a https://vimeo.com/420430704[~2 minute demo] of
normal browsing on
https://extratone.com/microsoft-surface-laptop-2-review-windows-future[my
Surface Laptop 2].

In terms of touch support, Edge remains the only acceptable browser on
Windows 10. If you've spent money on a new PC recently, chances are your
device is touch-enabled. If you're like me, you've already
https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4028019/windows-enable-and-disable-your-touchscreen-in-windows-10[disabled
it]. If not, you'll find scrolling and navigation in Edge have improved
tremendously ‚Äì it's like an entirely new browser
https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/6/18527550/microsoft-chromium-edge-google-history-collaboration[because
it is].

____
Because Edge used a different rendering engine than Chrome or Safari, it
meant that it would sometimes have problems on websites. Testing a
website against multiple browsers has always been difficult, and because
Edge had so little uptake, it meant optimizing for it often fell off the
priority list for web developers.
____

I really like how easy it is to mute audio from tabs and how much better
https://write.as[my CMS] is rendered. I still prefer Firefox's method of
tab switching (by last-used chronologically instead of in the order
presented.) The reader view is smoother than its competitors and offers
a beautiful selection of themes as well as the best ‚ÄúRead aloud‚Äù feature
in the business.

image:xhtml/https:/i.snap.as/jWqG85f.png[Microsoft Edge Reader View]

I'm not going to quote you measurements ‚Äì check out
https://www.computerworld.com/article/3513973/microsofts-new-edge-browser-third-times-the-charm.html[_Computerworld_'s
browser review] for that ‚Äì but I can say that Edge Chromium is using
more RAM than Firefox but a bit less than Chrome.
http://office.com[Office.com] also looks and works incredibly well.
Overall, I'm extremely impressed with Edge Chromium and the improvements
to Bing. As of my experiences today, it's the fastest and smoothest web
browser I have, which is a complete flip from that of the old Edge.

[[section0085.xhtml#in-stephen-king-s-the-langoliers-the-state-of-today-s-air-travel-is-foreshadowed]]
=== In Stephen King's ‚ÄúThe Langoliers,‚Äù the state of today's air travel is foreshadowed.

I told myself I would not be topical ‚Äì that I would publicly ignore the
coronavirus ‚Äì but I can no longer. There is simply too much to say about
one of the most emotionally effective, surreal films of my childhood.
_The Langoliers_ occupied 9-11PM's slot on ABC for May 14th and 15th,
1995 (Sunday and Monday, twenty-five years ago.) It's an adaptation of a
https://www.amazon.com/Langoliers-Stephen-King/dp/1982136057[Stephen
King novel] of the same title and is fairly widely-regarded as
https://letterboxd.com/yojrb/film/the-langoliers/[the worst such
adaptation] of all time. You can now watch the whole three hours of _The
Langoliers_ in 360p (supposedly) at your leisure
https://open.tube/videos/watch/397129b2-25fc-49c0-a802-881c5dad5b06?controls=0&title=0&warningTitle=0[thanks
to OpenTube] (for now.) One commenter (on the since-taken-down YouTube
video) echoes what I'm about to tell you: ‚ÄúMy god! I thought I dreamed
this movie up as a kid. I have been trying to describe this to people
for years and here it is, it‚Äôs real!‚Äù In order to write this, I joined
the https://discord.gg/X3bAngj[Stephen King Wiki Discord server] and was
immediately welcomed with a request not to type in the text channels:
‚ÄúI‚Äôm working on adding some new channels so pls nobody type in them til
I‚Äôm done.‚Äù

_The Langoliers_ begins with a pissed-off British secret agent (Mark
Lindsay Chapman,) an insane businessman (Bronson Pinchot,) a psychic,
vision-impaired young woman (Kate Maberly,) Sarah Jessica Parker
(Patricia Wettig,) and a _just_-widowed pilot (David Morse) all boarding
the same redeye flight to Boston ‚Äì American Pride Flight 29. This group
falls asleep and mysteriously wakes up alone on the aircraft except for
Stephen King himself (Dean Stockwell,) a stupid incel violinist
(Christopher Collet,) and a stoner (Kimber Riddle.) My favorite
character, Craig Toomey, is the ‚Äútwerp‚Äù business boy with daddy issues
who can't stop himself from demanding to know what's going on. James
Bond shuts him up with a ‚Äúnose hold.‚Äù

____
Whoa. No one's driving the plane!
____

David Morse proceeds to try and contact air traffic control in a
fairly-realistic manner, but is unable to receieve any radio signals at
all, even from Strategic Air Command. Frankie Faison plays the single
person of color on the flight, Don Gaffney ‚Äì ‚Äúa tool and die worker for
Hughes Aircraft‚Äù ‚Äì who dies first, of course. James Bond lecures David
about inciting panic and almost immediately reveals his secret identity.
Then, the Hungry Idiot (Baxter Harris) wakes up whilst Toomey begins
screaming again.

____
Scaring the little girl? Scaring the little girl?! Lady, we're diverting
to some tin-pot airport in the middle of nowhere, and I've got better
things to think about than scaring the little girl!
____

After the entirety of the male cast threatens to beat him up, Toomey,
sweating his balls off, begins slowly tearing strips of paper and
moaning sexually like an absolute madman. Some irritiatingly irrelevant
dialogue insues in which Stephen King Author Man narrates through
Sherlock Holmes deduction to figure absolutely nothing out. He is
wearing stripes on plaid. He suggests that the entire situation could be
some sort of government experiment and I can't believe I'm wasting your
time with this. ‚ÄúIf it were just this plane, I could give you a
scenario, but unfortunately, it's not just this plane. The city of
Denver is probably still down there, but all its lights were off if it
was.‚Äù Here you can see how excellently
https://eileenlong-my.sharepoint.com/:b:/g/personal/david_eileenlonglcsw_com/EUcVc3WXy4FLkBEtbl6ZOkgBXJSgV9zkQlACXEaq3U3DJQ[this
script] was written.

____
I've been sitting here running all these old stories through my head.
You know, time warps, space warps, alien raiding parties. I mean, we
really don't know if there's anything left down there, do we?
____

Sarah Jessica Parker reveals to Powers Girl that she's on her way to
meet a guy she's been emailing with. Stoner girl asks if everything is
going to be okay and Incel Violinist looks horny. She's going to rehab
for stones. The captain announces to his nine passengers that they're
beginning their descent into Bangor International Airport, near Stephen
King's birthplace. Don asks Toomey to stop ripping up paper and the
useless food addict yells ‚Äúwell, at least we'll be able to get some chow
when we land‚Äù offscreen. Craig, sweating even more, is still ripping up
magazines in the face of Don's threats. ‚ÄúTry it, you little jackass,‚Äù he
says. I'm wondering where I can snag this American Pride livery for
Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020. Director Tom Holland manages to add
drama to a more-or-less routine landing.

____
This place is utterly, totally deserted... You know, there's something
wrong with the air here, Brian.
____

It's occuring to me that this may be the worst script I've ever actually
sat through reading. ‚ÄúThis place smells wrong. Really badly wrong.‚Äù
Toomey threatens to sue the airline for $30 million for missing his 9AM
meeting before seeing flashbacks to his abusive father (John Griesemer,)
who mentions the Langoliers for the first time. The deserted airport
scene is the reason I've written this whole thing ‚Äì the dulled sounds of
the characters' heels on the tarmac, the putrefied air. The clocks have
stopped. The payphones are dead. The computers are lifeless. The
_abadonedness_ of it all. This is what the coronavirus has done to the
world and to Craig Toomey. Even the battery-powered devices are dead.
This is what confuses Stephen King Author Man to the point of
head-rubbing and cigarette smoking for the first time in ten years.

The production was actually made at Bangor International Airport as
https://youtu.be/D6McXLFsx-M[this incredible video] hosted by Toomey's
actor explores.

____
LOVE IS NOT PART OF THE BIG PICTURE!
____

It's never actually explained what The Langoliers are. Ken Tucker for
_Entertainment Weekly_ describes them as
‚Äúhttps://ew.com/article/1995/05/12/tv-movie-review-langoliers/[little
meatballs].‚Äù The little Beatles-haired girl can hear them approaching.
‚ÄúIt sounds a little like rice krispies after you pour the milk.‚Äù Foodism
abounds. ‚ÄúA really terrible, scary sound... Something making that
horrible cereal noise.‚Äù She screams that the cereal is going to kill
them. Somehow, Toomey finds a revolver while he's losing his mind.
Kimber Riddle the Stoner https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0725760/[went to
NYU].

____
Don't forget, Craiggy-weggy, the langoliers were here. And they will be
back.
____

Stephen King Author Man and Food Addict note that the food and soda have
gone completely flat. ‚ÄúTastes like old tire,‚Äù says Don. ‚ÄúWhat we're
dealing with is time, not dimension,‚Äù says Stephen King. I'm wondering
what in the hell sort of room they're in at the moment, and who decided
those light wood countertops were _ever_ a good idea.

____
The bottom line is, I believe, that we have hopped an absurdly short
distance into the past, say as little as 15 minutes, and we're
discovering the unlovely truth about time travel. That one can't appear
in the Texas State School Book Depository on November 22nd, 1963 and
hope to stop the Kennedy assassination. One can't witness the building
of the pyramids or the sack of Rome, or investigate the age of the
dinosaurs firsthand. No, fellow time travellers, have a look around you.
This is the past. It's empty. It's silent. It's a world with all the
meaning of a discarded old paint can. Sensory input has disappeared.
Electricity has already disappeared. And time itself is winding down in
a kind of a spiral that's going faster and faster.
____

Little Prophet notes that the sound she's been hearing is once again
getting louder. Mr. Toomey's face is shoved in the floor, his nose bent.

[[section0086.xhtml#why-extratone-has-used-discord-instead-of-slack-for-our-team-chat]]
=== Why Extratone has used Discord instead of Slack for our team chat.

Back in 2015, I hosted a pre-_Extratone_ culture podcast called
https://open.spotify.com/episode/2zjkrB28csR68YoY1M1eSk[_Drycast_] with
musician friends from all over the net. To record remotely, we
originally used Teamspeak 3 ‚Äì a gamer VoIP staple. When I discovered
Discord, I thought we'd found podcasting heaven. Originally, the free
plan included 128kbps audio in its voice channels, which was nearly
twice what we were getting out of our _paid_ Teamspeak server. If I were
still podcasting, Discord's
https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360041721052-Server-Video[just-released
server video feature] would undoubtedly prove invaluable for live
streams.

https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/1261334179352100865

According to
https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/1261334179352100865?s=20[a poll I
ran on Twitter], 2/3rds of all people on Earth are thankful for
Discord's existence. This is not surprising considering what every
Discord user is still offered without spending any money at all:
community spaces with audio/video and text chat capability, organizable
by Twitch and YouTube-integrated roles with a plethora of different
permission options, instantly and easily shareable by customizable
temporary or permanent invite links through an application that's about
as cross-platform as one can get (Windows, Mac, Linux, Android, iOS, or
simply one's web browser.) Those of us that remember
https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/1244758973867229185[IRC], Ventrilo,
and Teamspeak should all consider Discord a tremendous gift.

Never before have so many VoIP, video, and text chat features been
offered together, or in such a beautiful package. ‚ÄúWhat we really did
was create an all-in-one voice, video, and text chat app that replaced
this constellation of tools that people would use,‚Äù said CEO Jason
Citron in https://youtu.be/NNJ2n6XKmmA[an interview with CNBC].
Technically in terms of these details, Discord _has no competition_.
Slack offers text and voice chat with its paid plans, yes, but nothing
close in terms of video ‚Äì especially considering
https://www.polygon.com/2019/8/9/20798559/discord-go-live-private-stream-voice-channel[Discord
Go Live], its fairly-new streaming feature, which allows users to stream
game video directly to 10 other users in the server. With some
jury-rigging, it's possible to simply screen share this way, which is an
essential sell for business video communication applications like Skype.

https://twitter.com/jab50yen/status/1270886743395520512

‚ÄúDiscord and Slack have many similarities, but Discord is the superior
tool,‚Äù says
https://medium.com/ardentunited/why-we-use-discord-and-not-slack-500ac8027824[esports
team Ardent United]. ‚ÄúDiscord has voice channels, which allows us to
easily chat with our supporters and other team members. Discord also
allows us to set user roles and permissions which makes moderation
extremely simple.‚Äù It's not just gaming companies, though. Decentralized
cloud platform Sia also
https://blog.sia.tech/sia-is-moving-from-slack-to-discord-195f87feb6a6[moved
their community] to Discord:

____
Its intended audience is gamers, but many large communities have
switched from Slack to Discord, including development communities like
https://facebook.github.io/react/blog/2015/10/19/reactiflux-is-moving-to-discord.html[Reactiflux]
and
https://medium.com/@polymoon/unreal-slackers-is-moving-to-discord-c93492eb0612[Unreal
Slackers]. It includes an unlimited number of users, unlimited file
uploads (with a per-file size limit), unlimited message histories, and
really great moderation and spam filtering features.
____

Slack is https://www.pcmag.com/reviews/slack[often praised] for its
integrations, but it shares support with
https://zapier.com/blog/slack-vs-discord/[Zapier] ‚Äì a dedicated web
integration service which more or less integrates them equally.

____
Slack works with https://slack.com/integrations[a long list of tools],
including Google Calendar, Zendesk, Salesforce, Wunderlist, and dozens
of others. If you're looking for an integration that isn't immediately
obvious, you can always turn to Zapier for help, because Slack is a
supported service. Zapier is an online service that creates integrations
between other apps and services, without you having to know any code to
make it happen.
____

For sharing detailed post embeds, there's also
https://discohook.org/[Discohook], which I just discovered. Productivity
company Chanty's blog wrote perhaps
https://www.chanty.com/blog/discord-vs-slack[the most in-depth
comparison] of the two services (emphasis theirs):

____
At their core, Discord and Slack and very similar. Both are *team chat
apps* with a similar interface. Both apps have *team communication
organized* in channels. The biggest difference between the two is their
*target audience*, and of course, their *specific features*.
____

Ultimately, one must decide how relevant the services' respective target
audiences are to productivity. For a not-for-profit media organization
like _Extratone_, Discord's features-for-price ratio is simply too rich
to pass up. If you'd like, https://discord.gg/0b9KQUKP858b0iZF[stop by
our server] or try out https://discord.new/Nx7gawD84mMx[our server
template].

[[section0087.xhtml#the-ancient-ip-s-mmo-is-still-online-albeit-with-some-disappointing-discontinuations]]
=== The ancient IP‚Äôs MMO is still Online, albeit with some disappointing discontinuations.

I entertained fantasies about a _Star Trek_ MMO since first experiencing
the genre through _Eve Online_ and _World of Warcraft_ in early
adolescence. The idea of commanding my own starship in a universe of
other ‚Äúcaptains‚Äù alongside a hand-picked bridge crew was a beguiling one
to myself and many others. This year, the game celebrated its
https://trekmovie.com/2020/01/29/star-trek-online-legacy-celebrate-10-years-of-sto-with-jeri-ryan-and-sonequa-martin-green/[ten-year
anniversary] (aligning well with the https://bilge.world/about[continued
involuntary beat] of this blog.) I‚Äôm currently in the midst of my annual
check-in with STO and thought an exploration of this most-consequential
video game of my life‚Äôs history would be an appropriate undertaking.

The execution of today‚Äôs final, Arc Games-owned and maintained product
is a particularly long and interesting one. As
https://www.engadget.com/2014-11-22-the-game-archaeologist-perpetuals-star-trek-online.html[Justin
Olivetti chronicled for _Engadget_], the license for _Star Trek Online_
was originally
https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/perpetual-entertainment-to-develop-and-publish-star-trek-massively-multiplayer-online-game[bought]
and developed on by Perpetual Entertainment, which was assaulted by
https://web.archive.org/web/20150127173934/http:/massively.joystiq.com/2007/12/12/perpetual-plot-thickens-lawsuit-filed[a
lawsuit] and extensive layoffs in December, 2006. The company was sued
by Kohnke Communications for allegedly selling ‚Äúvaluable assets like the
Star Trek Online license‚Äù to an affiliated entity called P2
entertainment. Clever. A quote from the complaint as
https://web.archive.org/web/20150128203353/http:/www.tentonhammer.com/node/15616[reported
by _Ten Ton Hammer_]:

____
‚ÄúOn information and belief, the assets transferred to P2 include
Perpetual Entertainment trademarks and copyrights, the perpetual.com
domain name, and assets related to Star Trek Online, including code and
the license‚Ä¶ Perpetual received less than market value for the assets it
transferred to P2, and the transfer made Perpetual insolvent (or
worsened Perpetual's existing insolvency).‚Äù
____

https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Star_Trek_Online_(Perpetual_Entertainment)[Perpertual‚Äôs
STO] was significantly different from today‚Äôs MMO. Instead of captaining
one‚Äôs own starship, ‚Äúplayers would have taken on the role of an officer

I was 14 in 2008 when I joined the original post-Perpetual Entertainment
STO IRC channel when the game's license was
https://web.archive.org/web/20150203103236/http:/massively.joystiq.com/2008/01/14/star-trek-online-is-under-new-management/[first
transferred] to Cryptic Studios. In fact, this channel was the only
reason I left IRC clients open on my computers for years. It was
exciting to find a community of people who were looking forward to
participating in a _Star Trek_ MMO as much as I was. I originally went
by the (very cringey) username ‚Äúcrazyhooligin,‚Äù under which my current
STO account is https://ufplanets.com/member.php?13827-DavidBlue=[still
registered]. In the IRC channel, I met Sata ‚Äì host of the now-defunct
https://eileenlong-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/g/personal/david_eileenlonglcsw_com/EV9rOQgmdINNpSWg2t_vXLwBMEMHCkqPUHOsoEX58AdkAg[MMO
Junkies podcast] and ex-Perpetual developer. He and the STORadio crew
accepted me into their Teamspeak conversations despite how strange and
unsocialized I was. I learned how
https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Star_Trek_Online_(Perpetual_Entertainment)[extensive]
and
https://johneaves.wordpress.com/2009/06/25/more-vulcans-from-the-perpetual-files/[beautiful]
their development had been. One wonders what Cryptic did with the
original game and art assets and who technically owns them now.

After
https://web.archive.org/web/20150203103236/http:/massively.joystiq.com/2008/01/14/star-trek-online-is-under-new-management/[acquiring
the rights] to make the game in early-2008, Cryptic was legally
compelled to come up with a completed product in two years‚Äô time as
then-Executive Producer
https://sto.gamepedia.com/Stephen_D'Angelo[Stephen D‚ÄôAngelo] explained
on the https://youtu.be/a0tP0YrlJB0[100th episode of the _STOked_

We were under a very massive deadline to deliver the game. We had

_STOked_ also provided an excellent historical account of the
acquisition entitled ‚Äúhttps://youtu.be/Fhed2yKVYwY[How Cryptic Saved

https://trekmovie.com/2009/10/22/star-trek-online-begins-closed-beta-trekmovie-giving-away-keys/[entered
Closed Beta], which I somehow acquired a key for in the name of
https://web.archive.org/web/20100521081251/http:/www.stoholic.com/[STOHolic.com]
(a blogger site which represents one of my first web projects ever.) I
was dual-booting Windows 7 Beta on my 2008 MacBook, which only supported
2 of its 4GB of RAM. The resulting performance was not optimal, but I
was tremendously excited just to participate. Somewhere, there are at
least three 480p handicam videos of Closed and Open Beta gameplay taken
from over my shoulder, but I could not find them at the time of this
writing. Comparatively, beta looked drastically different from the
property that‚Äôs online today. In https://youtu.be/vH73ATZ96-w[this video
of the original entry tutorial], we are introduced to the game‚Äôs basic
controls by the voice of Zachary Quinto of J.J. Abrams fame as the new
Emergency Medical Hologram in godawful dropshadowed text. The lighting
is dated, the blue-based user interface even more so.

The hair was bad and the textures of the armor, worse. So was mine,
though. I uploaded two videos under my STOholic name: an
https://youtu.be/pqGll-DZp6s[unboxing of the Collector‚Äôs Edition] and
what appears to be https://youtu.be/ghUJm9YWiVc[the definitive YouTube
tutorial] to run _Star Trek Online_ on Mac OSX using the (now defunct)
wineskin wrapper. Though I was sixteen years old, I appear to be about
eight. Endless waves of ground enemies, pressing the ‚Äú1‚Äù key hundreds of
thousands of times to whittle them away with my phaser rifle. There were
bugs on top of bugs. My favorite was a swap between one's ground and
space avatars: a gigantic captain would appear in space and a little
ship would appear on the ground.

is possible, but not necessarily advised. Generally, one specs an

[[section0087.xhtml#the-exploration-system]]
=== The Exploration System

For many _Star Trek_ fans, _Star Trek Online_‚Äôs combat feels excessive.
Or at least, that‚Äôs what you‚Äôd think. The current reality is that search

Somna take], and‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs about it. There was a definite (and entirely
reasonable) argument against the amount of combat across the community
early in the game‚Äôs development, but it looks like the arguers have
simmered down and/or given up. This is also reasonable, considering its
now ten-year lifespan. The only trouble is that non-combat options in
_Star Trek Online_ have actually diminished over the years.

image:xhtml/https:/i.snap.as/BicLSE5.jpg[Star Trek Online Romulan Borg]

The original https://sto.gamepedia.com/Exploration_Cluster[Exploration
System] was an ingenious and significant idea that
‚Äúhttps://www.arcgames.com/en/games/star-trek-online/news/detail/6002963-exploration-cluster-removal[used
automated tools to facilitate large quantities of widely varied
content].‚Äù Unfortunately, the result was ‚Äúnothing close to what
[Cryptic] originally planned.‚Äù Instead of inspiring variety, Exploration
Clusters ended up becoming the most repetitive activity in the game ‚Äì
nothing more than a good source of crafting materials. The missions were
generic and the environments simply randomly combined segments of the
same interior textures. Procedurally generated environments would hit
the mainstream conversation years later with

____
Using procedural generation isn‚Äôt simply about offloading the creative
process onto an algorithm ‚Äì the real challenge is that it requires
developers to teach an algorithm the difference between good and bad
game design.
____

Perhaps if _Star Trek Online_‚Äôs initial development window had not been
so limited, Cryptic would‚Äôve had time and resources to pioneer something
truly _Trek_ and extraordinary in the exploration system, but it ended
up having to kill the idea altogether ‚Äì no amount of
https://www.change.org/p/cryptic-bring-exploration-to-star-trek-online-and-sto-back-to-the-true-roots-of-star-trek[Change.org
petitions] could prevent this.

[[section0087.xhtml#the-foundry]]
=== The Foundry

Perhaps _the_ most innovative feature _Star Trek Online_ contributed to
gaming as a whole came to the live server in Spring, 2011. It was called
https://sto.gamepedia.com/The_Foundry[The Foundry], and it allowed
players access to a diluted form of the same mission creation tools
Cryptic themselves used to create content, enabling the community to
publish its own playable stories. The result was a wonder virtually
inexpressible in words. In player-made Foundry Missions, I found joy,
wonder, sorrow, and insight ‚Äì truly everything and more than one could
ever want from fiction. Throughout 2013-2014 my girlfriend at the time
and I ran regular
https://sto.gamepedia.com/Foundry:List_of_missions[Foundry missions]
together along with couple friends in our fleet. Unfortunately, I cannot
remember a single specific mission (aside from
https://youtu.be/zrXTZfHk4HQ[_Unholy Alliances_], I think,) but I
remember the storytelling. I remember laughing at, dwelling on, and even
crying for the characters we were introduced to. There were
farming-oriented missions and some fairly rough drafts, sure, but the
vast majority of the content was deliberately and delicately considered,
especially the
https://www.arcgames.com/en/games/star-trek-online/news/detail/3027483[Foundry
Spotlight] series, which highlighted player-created stories of a
particular quality and intrigue.

image:xhtml/https:/i.snap.as/CGCgrAb.jpg[Ambassador Class]

Last April, however,
https://www.arcgames.com/en/games/star-trek-online/news/detail/11102923[Arc
retired the Foundry forever] ‚Äì perhaps the worst possible news ‚Äì stating
‚Äúthe legacy knowledge required to maintain the Foundry at our quality
standards is no longer available,‚Äù meaning ‚Äì as
http://www.containsmoderateperil.com/blog/2019/3/4/cryptic-to-close-the-foundry[Rodger
Edwards notes] ‚Äì that all developers with their hands, hearts, and heads
in the project had long since departed the company. The community
reaction was heartbreaking. On Reddit, a group of mission authors and
devotees
https://www.reddit.com/r/sto/comments/ayobu4/one_mans_quest_to_save_the_foundry/[committed
to capturing] as many Foundry Missions as possible on video in the month
between the announcement and date of death. User

Foundry as a critical hit to _Star Trek Online_‚Äôs endgame:

Though _STOked_ and _STORadio_ have long since been off the air, the
Roddenberry Podcast Network‚Äôs _PriorityOne_ is still going strong,
having just recorded
https://priorityonepodcast.com/460-rebranding-kirk-casting-groupees-priority-one-a-roddenberry-star-trek-podcast/[its
460th episode]. As I discovered last year, the game‚Äôs Twitch community
is also thriving. https://www.twitch.tv/layriena[Layiena]‚Äôs streams are
incredible because ‚Äì while he understands theory as well as the other
broadcasters in the STO Twitch community ‚Äì it‚Äôs his incredible skills at
live Captain commentary (calling out abilities and other command inputs
as if he really is in the captain‚Äôs chair.) It may sound cringey (and
perhaps it would be to many,) but his thoroughness and accuracy actually
1) make it seem pretty darn cool to me and 2) are hugely valuable in
helping the viewer understand what he‚Äôs doing. After some three years, I
know my one rotation fairly well, but only three or four of its steps by
name ‚Äì not even remotely well enough to do what he does. Unfortunately,
it appears as though he‚Äôs been inactive since last year.

https://www.twitch.tv/sphynx_sto[Sphynx]‚Äôs streams also have an
especially professional feel ‚Äì he is excellent at calling out his
actions as well, if perhaps without so much intensity. His Norwegian
sensibility is wonderful: when I introduced myself as being around in
the community since 2008, he remarked ‚Äúthat‚Äôs strange considering the
game has only been out since 2010.‚Äù Nigh-universally common threads
among them: imperturbable kindness to their audience and an impressively
wholesome commitment to _actually having fun_. Though I‚Äôm far from
deeply saturated with Twitch culture as a whole, I‚Äôve watched my fair
share of _Eve Online_, _World of Warships_, and _Gran Turismo Sport_
streams, and ‚Äì while all of these have incredible communities ‚Äì there‚Äôs
none quite like the sincerity of the _Star Trek_ fraternity.

https://youtu.be/KHhakbz6q8s[in-depth video review] of the two missions
as well as a https://youtu.be/M3KJkcCaymA[tour of the event as a whole].
I, for one, have never been partial to Shiny New Ship gluttony largely
because of how long it took me to ‚Äúmaster‚Äù my own Intrepid-Class
Retrofit ‚Äì christened the U.S.S. _Bataan_ after the aircraft carrier my
grandfather served on in WWII ‚Äì as much as I have. It took me years to
arrange my bridge officer abilities and their keybinds in such a way
that I could maintain a fairly-steady dps rotation and I have no desire
to go through the process of learning a new ship again. For most veteran
players, however, trying out different ships/skill specs is all there is
left to do.

Choosing whether or not ‚Äì or to whom ‚Äì to recommend the game is an issue
best left to actual gaming journalists. In March, _Massively
Overpowered_ ‚Äì the followup project to what was once _Massively.com_ ‚Äì

F.M. Edwards argued] in January that _Star Trek Online_ is best left to
those who already love _Star Trek_:

____
STO has some things going for it as a video game, and it‚Äôs certainly
unique in the MMO space, but it has too many basis quality issues for it
to be a game I‚Äôd recommend to someone who‚Äôs never watched an episode of
Star Trek.
____

Compared to what I experienced all those years ago in Closed and Open
Beta, _Star Trek Online_ is now _vastly_ more polished, but perhaps
compared to other MMOs in 2020, it is, indeed, ‚Äúrough.‚Äù In my casual
return this past month, I have yet to experience any significant bugs.
Considering his character data dates back to launch, I‚Äôd like to think
that the server is set into some brief, confused panic every time I log
in to Kuvak, but perhaps that‚Äôs just a fantasy. I have still been
enjoying the space combat in the classic Advanced-level

worth giving this free-to-play game a shot. My two point eight pound

_Listen to the entirety of the chapter read aloud by Siri Voice 2
below._

In the right hour, the woodland springtime metamorphic processes of the
neighboring Lake Geneva suburb‚Äôs in-betweens were in a paused state ‚Äì
the toads again hushed; the crickets tired, and the human populace, too.
In the right hour, the fickle wind and the social owls were the only
sound, and nothing moved but the sparse, light-footed doe in careful
segments with her fawn. From the main gated lane of _The Nice, Huge
Estate_, Lenny Lather slid through the muddy barrier and started
bouncing West on the blacktop, brogues squeaking every third step. The
overcasted clouds were having trouble deciding whether or not to let
down their rain ‚Äì as they had been all day ‚Äì and the old, heavy
early-March mist softened the yellow glow of the tall, buzzing
streetlamps so much that he couldn‚Äôt help but intermittently wipe his
eyes, for the spreading light convinced his mind that his eyelashes
must‚Äôve been wetted.

Theodore Pith‚Äôs big old house was now burrowed between two mismatched
neighborhoods ‚Äì the bleaker Easterly, which was too new for its alien
trees to have recovered from the brutality of its development‚Äôs
clear-cutting and contained within one of its central featureless
backyards an unidentifiable creature which made all through the night
the most unimaginably ghastly, disturbingly human child-like shrieking;
the opposing Westerly‚Äôs trees further enough along in their regrowth ‚Äì
ten or twenty years perhaps ‚Äì to appear more of the planet Earth to
Manhattan-bred Lenny Lather, who still found the colorless destruction
of suburbia unendingly upsetting, especially when coming down. In the
interest of his regular withdrawal‚Äôs mitigation, he had already
established two short, repeatable tracks and a longer, several mile-long
loop which skirted him sufficiently around the East‚Äôs center to avoid
hearing the shrieks in all but the stillest nights. Never in his years ‚Äì
on these walks he was _especially_ reminded of just how many there were
‚Äì had he been able to feel such absolute ownership of his surroundings.
The eroding Earth slipping away from the hem of the warped, stained wood
fences; the sidewalks, cracked, bent, sloped helter-skelter, often
muddied in the troughs and joints ‚Äì generally laying haphazardly in
layers after having been steadily tossed about by the glacial forces of
their intermixture with clay, precipitation, and the tumultuous
temperature-dependent torture of the two ‚Äì these were his, entirely, in
the right hour. Between two and five in the morning when the earliest
risers would blearily revive their dewy automobiles from long, silent
hibernation, the whole world ‚Äì everything in his sight and more at any
moment ‚Äì it was all _his_, without a single worthy challenger.

In the right hour, the roads were completely and totally abandoned ‚Äì for
the New Yorker, an unfathomable absolute ‚Äì and all humanity was at rest.
In the right hour, Lenny Lather was the appointed guardian of the worn
domesticity of a small nation, though the lonely occupation was
astoundingly lax, for in the miles and miles of empty streets he had
already traversed in his nightly holidays from the World of Pith, he had
yet to encounter a single unexpected factor or minutely threatening
presence. Since shortly after his December arrival, he‚Äôd walked through
even the most frigid mornings. Of course, the stillness had then been
_even more_ otherworldly, and Lenny was curious to see how his new most
private domain would change with the seasons. Though the auxiliary guest
room which he now called home was no smaller or less hospitable than the
master bedroom of his late Hudson Yards flat shared with his late Wife,
it proved to be a poor respite from Theodore Pith, who treated him ‚Äì
when they were ‚Äúhome‚Äù at _Nice, Huge_ ‚Äì as the puppy he never had, and
expected his participation to remain entirely vulnerable to his any
whim. Granted ‚Äì in their shared abuse of amphetamines, cocaine, and
assorted other stimulants ‚Äì Lenny Lather was vastly more prepared for
the games than any circadian guest could‚Äôve possibly been. At first, the
ten-foot door of his dawn-facing room had closed without latching, but
with the warmth and moisture brought with the Midwestern Spring, the
most secure state in which the engorged wood could be forcibly arranged
still left a half-inch crack, and Lather‚Äôs last chance of privacy was
lost.

The latest favorite pastime of _Nice, Big_‚Äôs Master necessitated a
willing, capable driver, and ‚Äì as keeping a single Butler (much less an
entire household staff) was proving extremely difficult for him ‚Äì Lenny
Lather was the sole pick of the draft. In the earliest hours of one
Tuesday morning in February, he‚Äôd been pleasantly dosing and drooling on
his laptop after an evening of obsessive, incoherent notetaking when the
huge door had been kicked ajar by a deep black, blindingly shiny oxford
with excessively violent force. Attached to the shoe in an equally
blinding penguin tuxedo, towering bowler hat, and cartoonish fake
mustache was the Great, Blown Pith.

‚ÄúHope you‚Äôre not busy,‚Äù he‚Äôd said quite loudly to the lolling Lather,
leaning and tilting his head into the lamp light, which had dislodged
his monocle and briefly occupied him with untangling its chain.

‚Ä¶

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not _busy_, are ya?!‚Äù he‚Äôd shouted, tapping the shiny brass
lion‚Äôs head of his shiny black cane against the vanity‚Ä¶ then swatting it
with a flicking wrist‚Ä¶ then clubbing it with a full, two-handed homerun
swing ‚Äì taking huge, vaguely cat nose-shaped gouges from the surface of
the wood. The splintery wood chips had rained down upon the hunched
Lenny; he‚Äôd stirred with one found its way in his open mouth ‚Äì he‚Äôd
chewed it slowly and swallowed it, but he still had not awoken.
Nevertheless, Theodore Pith‚Äôs coked-up enthusiasm couldn‚Äôt possibly have
yielded to common decencies like his guest‚Äôs nighttime peace.

‚Ä¶

‚ÄúSHOOT, LENNY,‚Äù he‚Äôd screamed in his companion‚Äôs ear, having traversed
the room to his bedside.

‚ÄúI SURE HOPE YOU‚ÄôRE NOT BUSY RIGHT NOW!‚Äù

‚Ä¶

Finally, he‚Äôd resorted to tickling Lenny‚Äôs nose with the ornament, which
had reeked with the urinal smell of metal polish ‚Äì the sudden,
overwhelming delivery of which to the writer‚Äôs olfactory nerves finally
causing ample alarm in his nervous system to justify bringing him
abruptly back to his life and deluded host.

‚ÄúI need a favor. The Duesie‚Äôs warming up. We‚Äôre going for a ride.‚Äù

Unable to form a linguistic response, Lenny Lather had obeyed Theo‚Äôs
frenzied, repeating instructions and stumbled into the matching suit
he‚Äôd brought over his arm ‚Äì wondering with marginal, arrested clarity at
how well-tailored it was for him. He had not the soundness of perception
to protest when Pith had whipped a deep black, blindingly shiny bowtie
around his already-congested esophagus, nor when he‚Äôd adheased the huge,
itchy matching fake moustache to his upper lip and nearly pulled the
matching Tower of Bowler all the way down over his ears. He had been
unresponsive when he‚Äôd been sat on the bench under the agonizing
fluorescent lights of the laundry room, affixed with deep black,
blindingly shiny matching oxfords, and asked if he smoked and how well
he could say _guffaw._

‚Ä¶

‚ÄúJust wait‚Ä¶ you have no idea‚Ä¶ you have no idea how much fun this is
going to be.‚Äù

Lenny Lather had not‚Ä¶ _could not_ have made a sound through the
confusing nonsense of his waking pre-Great Depression dream, but when
the old servant‚Äôs door had been opened before him and set the heartless,
single-digit Winter wind upon his very soul, he had all at once arrived
in the world, laughing and whooping together with Theodore Pith.

‚ÄúJesus _Christ!_‚Äù he‚Äôd screamed as they‚Äôd hobbled to the stable, where a
devilishly dark red Model J Duesenberg had sat shivering in a rough
idle, staring out the retrofitted garage door with its basketball-sized
lights as if it was, indeed, a flesh-and-blood steed that had just been
frightened awake by a thunderstorm, but the sky had been as clear as it
would‚Äôve been from an asteroid ‚Äì as it is only on the coldest nights ‚Äì
and almost comically dominated by the setting, gluttonously luminescent
moon. Theodore had then grabbed a screwdriver from the workbench and
bent down to remove the license plate ‚Äì which had said _BLOOD_ in big
black bold block letters ‚Äì and its containing frame. By the time he had
settled into the frigid red leather of the exposed, roofless driver‚Äôs
seat, Lenny Lather was full-to-bursting with adrenaline and laughing out
huge streams of breathy steam. From behind him in the cabin, Pith had
been _guffawing_ plumes, too, as he‚Äôd briefly ignited his
cocaine-sprinkled mustache instead of the bratwurst-sized cigar between
his teeth. The smell of burning human hair had accented his explanation
of the old car‚Äôs transmission and its direct path from source-to-nose
for Pith had required a brief, unplanned intermission as it induced
without warning his violent heaving ‚Äì still part-_guffawing_ ‚Äì hanging
half out of his beautifully-upholstered suicide door.

As he had spewed ‚Äì expertly sparing the swoop of the gleaming waxy
fender ‚Äì Lenny had found a pair of deep black, blindingly shiny gloves
and ‚Äì after less grinding than you would imagine, to his credit ‚Äì first
gear, setting the whole dastardly circus in motion.

‚ÄúWhere to, Sire?‚Äù Lenny had asked, nose lifted to an untenable altitude
in a pitiful approximation of an accent that‚Äôd never actually been used
before by any person or persons in all of history, struggling for
breath.

‚ÄúLeft at the gates, Barnsward, old chap,‚Äù Theodore had replied in a
contrasting fashion after again sitting upright from his heaves and
taking a breath, ironing out ‚Äì if anything ‚Äì the flatness of his
perforating Ohio Ds and Ps, resulting in such a culturally destructive
racket that it had set both of them in uncontrollable, cloudy fits
lasting long after Lather had swerved the great length of the car from
the gravel to his abandoned asphalt retreat. The two had continued their
banter down that soul-suckingly flat vector, one-upping each other‚Äôs
etymologic barbarity against the savage thievery of the heatless wind.

‚ÄúNow to star-board, Budleigh, my good fellow!‚Äù

‚Ä¶

‚ÄúRight-o, as you say, sir!‚Äù

‚Ä¶

‚ÄúDown to the _pu-hb_ for a _spaht_ of _brahn_-dee with me _mae-its_!‚Äù

‚Ä¶

‚Äú_Oncemo-ar_ right, pip pip!‚Äù

‚Ä¶

‚ÄúBy _jah-lee_, there we are!‚Äù

‚Ä¶

After the entirety of Northern European history had been decimated and
subsequently forgotten, the Duesenberg named _BLOOD_ had turned its
orange, googley-eyed stare and narrow whitewalled hooves up the
reflective, freshly-painted access of the new 24-hour grocery in the
no-man‚Äôs-land between the cookie-cutter stares of the neatly-rowed
Easterly neighborhood and the droning respiration of Interstate 43, two
miles distant. It was 2:12 in the morning and most of the greasy-haired
night stocking shift had been halfway through their third smoke break,
circled around a store-used picnic table 50 yards from the far sliding
airlock doors. The first to spot _BLOOD_ had been the second shortest of
the lot, whose weary scrutiny along the truest radian to the West from
under his sweaty beanie in her entrance she had crossed, and the depth
of her red as he first spied it had caused him vertigo ‚Äì as if he would
fall in ‚Äì and cast upon the shorter-than-average length of his being an
all-consuming existential doubt. The tallest and loudest of them had
faced squarest the white faux-brick wall of the box building and was at
that moment engaged upon a spirited rant about where and where‚Äônt and
when a vapist ought to buy his Suck juice between long, gasping Sucks
from his super-shiny Suck box. Of course, the arrival of a customer even
at such a late hour did not warrant notice at a huge, broadly-servicing
operation like theirs, but as _BLOOD_ had crept through all four
reflective yellow-checkered pedestrian crossings, closing without a
flinch, and the details of her occupying caricatures had become more and
more numerous, she had stolen the attention of the huddle, one-by-one,
and elicited from each the rarest under-breath profanity of true,
unmolested wonder.

‚Äú_Jesus Christ_,‚Äù had said the shortest.

‚Äú_Holy fuck,_‚Äù had said the youngest.

‚Äú_Gee whiz_,‚Äù had said the oldest.

And the Sucking tallest, having realized he‚Äôd lost his audience, had
been the last to turn and follow their eyes _BLOOD_‚Äôs way as she had
halted coolly in front of the purely white glowing concrete leading into
the closest customer entrance, and had ‚Äì without the gradual exposure
over the length of her approach that his peers had been afforded ‚Äì
dropped his Suck box and exclaimed at the sudden, undiluted immensity of
the spectacle, simply, ‚Äú_FUCK!_‚Äù

The Sucking‚Äôs _FUCK_ and the splitting shatter of his Suck against the
glass of their smoking table had reached the two arrivees ‚Äì albeit in a
muted way ‚Äì and through the onset of their frostbite‚Äôs early stages even
further stoked their already-uncontrollable boyish giggling. Theodore
Pith had paused briefly to affix his monocle as firmly as possible in
his eye socket and stuff down his spasmic _guffaws_ with a few
lip-smacking puffs of his then successfully-lit cigar before swinging
his right door open.

‚ÄúStay here and wait at the ready, my good‚Ä¶ my _best_ Bagsy! I shan‚Äôt be
a twinkle,‚Äù he had declared, clicking it lightly shut again and turning
on his heels toward the pale light of the store, twirling his cane in
dramatically shortened strides so as to reproduce the oversped effect of
a silent motion picture, puff-puffing away. As the doors had sensed him
and indiscriminately whirred aside, he had turned to the smokers ‚Äì most
of whom had still been reeling, grabbing for their hair ‚Äì and bobbed the
bulk of his big black bowler toward their communion with his gloved
black fingers by the brim.

‚ÄúTally-_ho_, my boys!‚Äù he had shouted, sending Lenny Lather‚Äôs wide open
face toward the floor of the idling car as he doubled over himself in
the first spontaneously asphyxiating, tear-lobbing laughter he‚Äôd yet to
experience in the 21st century. As Theodore had entered the masterpiece
of the boxed store‚Äôs bleakness in his cane twirling, head swinging,
cigar puffing shuffle, he had made sure to stay his instinct to _sneak_
for a swift, full-chat _dart_, instead, and the on-duty leather-faced
embodiment of tedium‚Äôs wrath beneath his lone lit lane light had looked
up from his _People_ Magazine just in time to see the heel of a deeply
black oxford and the last shiny inches of flowing black coattails
disappear behind the potato sack endcap of the far Aisle 1. He‚Äôd
hesitated, chin against palm, holding his next glossed page
perpendicularly erect between his tightened thumb and index finger for a
long few seconds of fantastic stillness ‚Äì had hastily attempted a
diagnostic of his present senses ‚Äì before a locomotive-like segmented
tube of cigar smoke had risen from against the light tiles and unsoiled
trimming to intersect his line-of-sight where it met the darkened deli,
recessed in the far wall from his hunch, the motion startling him into
his own throat-clearing, counter-rounding, key-jingling, _excuse
me_-shouting march toward the lumpy potato sacks and the climbing
dissipation of the most unbelievable violation. As he had jingled, he
had reflected on the few occasions in which he‚Äôd ever smelled tobacco
smoke in _his_ store: all incidental, most very brief, and many followed
by a lengthy, unreasonably self-deprecating apology. To just walk in his
Temple of Domestic Fulfilment during this most Serene Time of Silent
Service, spewing orange nicotine on his premium, Food & Drug
Administration-blessed body and blood offering to the middle class was
surely in ignorance, but could have even been _in spite_. Regardless,
the transgression was worthy of the most merciless wrath, and he had
been selected as its willing, capable vessel. In just the fifteen
seconds it‚Äôd taken him to jingle his way to Aisle 1, he‚Äôd thought
himself and his leather into flash-broiling, fast-rising fury.

Perhaps the least expected sight that could have possibly greeted this
Apostle of Appraisal on the far side of Aisle 1 ‚Äì as he rounded the
potato sack endcap and filled his _excuse me_ lungs in preparation
through his nose ‚Äì was the labored lifting of the 125-pound eldest child
of the new, Parisian-trained, full-time, certified cheese artisan ‚Äì whom
the store had just won out of 175 competitors in a region-wide raffle of
her pilot program ‚Äì by the dashing, swinging, and smoking real-life
manifestation of a young Rich Uncle Pennybags, yet shock did not long
halt the Keys & Leather.

‚ÄúSir! Excuse me!‚Äù

‚Ä¶

‚Äú_Excuse me!_ Sir!‚Äù

‚Ä¶

Theodore Pith ‚Äì having reevaluated the girth of his intended booty ‚Äì had
propped his shiny black cane against the sill of the refrigerator and
popped each slack bottom up off his oxfords from his shins before
squatting over the massive Holy Wheel of the Artisan where it lay
displayed on a sturdy bespoke plinth.

‚Ä¶

‚ÄúSir! You need to put out that cigar‚Ä¶ the cigar ‚Äì put it out
immediately!‚Äù

Keys & Leather had the odd inability to both shout and shuffle at the
same time, so he‚Äôd only made it to the pomegranate juice by the time
Pith had mustered enough momentum to swing the cheese child into a high
enough pendulum to carry it stably facing forward under his chin with
his two hands spaced evenly on the Great Wheel‚Äôs bottom.

‚Ä¶

‚ÄúSir! I‚Äôm going to have to ask you to put that down‚Ä¶ That is a four
thousand dollar item‚Ä¶ If you want to buy it, we need to go about-‚Äù

‚Äú‚Ä¶now, see here!‚Äù Pith had replied with great effort, in the midst of
weighing in his mind the worth of the cane as a casualty, then of the
monocle, too, which had fallen out while he was weighing, and of his own
physical intelligence, and whether or not it was capable of retrieving
the cane by its brass lion‚Äôs head handle via the top of a flicking foot
without losing his balance. Keys & Leather, meanwhile, had been tortured
at great length witnessing ‚Äì in Theodore‚Äôs gravitational struggle ‚Äì the
Cuban‚Äôs ashes knocked all over the precious round Immanuel; the
artisan‚Äôs Beloved, Chosen son of cheese ‚Äì a nauseating sensation of loss
overwhelming all hope of his store‚Äôs defense. The Terrible Theodore had
at once noticed his hesitation _and_ arrived upon a plan to leave no
prop behind. He had leaned forward with the girth of the wheel and
closed the remaining few feet between them, advancing with the huge mass
of Nazarethian dairy to bear it all down upon the unsuspecting Leather,
who in his grief for the prized wheel was far too slow to deflect its
incoming mass.

‚ÄúNow, see here, chum!‚Äù Pith had forced from the furthest possible
extremis of his best mob mouth as he transferred his burden all at once
to its most concerned party, who collapsed against the multilayered
tables that made up the fresh cookie display, with the weight of the
wheel on his belly. As the stunned Leather struggled to separate himself
without further soiling the only item in his store that sold for double
a month‚Äôs paycheck, Theodore had replaced his monocle and returned for
his cane in a single stride, which he‚Äôd then used after a return step to
the pile of chocolate chip, almond nut, and fuming night manager to rap
loose with the snout of the terrible brass cat Leather‚Äôs white
knuckle-tight grip on the wheel with a lampoonish _haha!_ before rolling
the freed cheese toward the door in a villainous cackle.

‚ÄúMan, _come on_,‚Äù the defeated Leather had yelled halfheartedly from his
pile of sweets, struggling against the awkward, slippery boxes for
enough footing to stand. His efforts, though, were interrupted after a
time by the abrupt mute of Pith‚Äôs cackling in the second swooshing of
the front sliding doors ‚Äì he had missed his last chance of pursuit. It
had all been in vain ‚Äì he‚Äôd failed to guard the crown jewel of the whole
suburb. As he had given up the chase and the cheese and slumped once
more against the ruined pile, the ridiculousness of the crime against
him nearly cracked a smile, but soon was deterred by the very real
thought of explaining what had happened to his General Manager when she
arrived in just five hours. After a moment, there, covered in cookies,
dust, ashes, and shame, he had quietly begun to sob.

After he had regained control of his diaphragm, Lenny Lather had been
amused, outside, by the varying velocities in which the smokers of the
night shift gave in to their curiosities about the presence of the
seven-figure collectible and its purpose in waiting at its now healthier
idle in front of their grocery store in the loneliest time of a Tuesday
morning. The first and the bravest had been the one who first spotted
their intrusion ‚Äì the shortest ‚Äì if only because he had remained
entirely convinced for the duration that _BLOOD_ and its two,
period-dressed occupants were nothing but an apparition of his dead
Grandfather and Great Uncle like others he‚Äôd thought he‚Äôd seen before,
and ‚Äì though he‚Äôd been terrified by the clarity of this realest visit
yet, he‚Äôd been irritated more than anything, and wanted to know ‚Äúwhy the
hell can‚Äôt you just leave me _alone_?!‚Äù The others behind him had been
staggered in the proximity to the waiting car they had achieved ‚Äì the
lesser and most cowardly being the largest ‚Äì the Sucking evangelist ‚Äì
who had been waiting for the great automobile to leave so he could forge
the exchange of his broken Suck box for a new one from the back. In the
delirium of his exhaustion and progressing frostbite, Lenny Lather had
thought the image of the men where they were would make for an
interesting, organic graph on the nature of courage ‚Äì their positions
simply representing their unaltered datapoints, and had been considering
how best to deal with or respond to the nearer, deluded one, who had by
then come close enough to the elegant, professionally polished
front-right fender to reach out and touch it with his unwashed hands,
and appeared to be taking the matter under serious consideration. He‚Äôd
been seconds away from finally deciding between his idiotic ideas for a
joke response when by far the largest wheel of cheese he‚Äôd ever seen had
come rolling out of the opening doors onto the concrete, followed
closely behind by Theodore Pith who‚Äôd still had three-quarters or more
of his cigar left to smoke and apparently switched to cheap mob clich√©s
in his brief absence.

‚ÄúHaste, Don Lenny!‚Äù he‚Äôd yelled, re-opening his closest cabin door to
chuck his cane in first. He‚Äôd then straddled the great wheel to position
it against the step before making a scene of grunting and huffing
against its side with his full weight. Again, the bewildered smokers had
fallen silent ‚Äì they did not recognize the ridiculous delicacy because
it was special inventory and could only be handled by the Holy Artisan
herself. Lather had started revving the huge old straight-8 to answer
Pith‚Äôs urgency, who had found himself fresh out of phrases after the
wheel had finally succumbed to its capture and rolled into the footwell.

‚ÄúMake haste, make haste, my boy!‚Äù he‚Äôd shouted, diving theatrically into
the covered back seat, head-first, to which his icing chauffer had
responded by revving the behemoth and briskly popping her clutch, which
had lurched the pair into the last, getaway stage of their late grocery
heist. As _BLOOD_‚Äôs razor-edged hood ornament had sliced through the
night by the dumbstruck smokers, Theodore Pith was unable to think of
anything to shout at them as he passed but for ‚Äúbada-bing, bada-_BOOM!_‚Äù

Though the Lake Geneva Police Department was shown the security footage
of that first theft by management, the theatricality of their matching
getup had inadvertently obscured their identities, and the
organization‚Äôs extreme deficit of imagination had left them stumped by
the lack of license plates on the car, despite the free and effortless
ability of just about any casual enthusiast of early American luxury
automobiles and/or lackadaisical disciple of the Concours religion to
immediately identify _BLOOD_ by _name_ from the grainiest image, if
consulted. If anything, their incompetence rewarded Pith and Lather‚Äôs
continued focus on the products of the same store‚Äôs cheese artisan, as
intelligence on the state of her latest flagship incubation was freely
available with no more effort than it took to simply stop by her display
amid regular shopping trips. Twice in two weeks, they stole both of her
replacements for the biggest child without any significant alternation
of their method, which frustrated her and the management nearly to the
point of crises, and quickly lost all potential for fun in a third
attempt ‚Äì their kicks were in their absurdity, not their
_effectiveness_, and neither of them cared much for the cheese.

I'm not a ‚Äúreal‚Äù web developer ‚Äì nor do I mean to dictate to a single
one ‚Äì but I know enough theory to note that of this ‚Äúcore web‚Äù education
operation centered around web.dev is operating on some irritating
assumptions:

[[section0090.xhtml#1-smaller-assets-are-ideal]]
==== 1. Smaller assets are ideal.

The simple assumption that it is always better to have the smallest page
possible ‚Äì that images should be resized and compressed to hell and
typography/other elements should be few in number. Instantaneous page
loads should be priority over any other standards of measure for a web
page ‚Äì like interesting design, for instance.

network speeds are exponentially increasing] year-by-year. In 2018:

____
World-wide average mobile download speed was 22.82 Mbps (Megabits per
second), an increase of 15.2% over 2017. Average upload speed was 9.19
Mbps, an increase of 11.6%. Fixed broadband speeds also increased.
Average download speed increased 26.4% to 46.12 Mbps, while average
upload speed came in at 22.44 Mbps, a 26.5% increase.
____

I may be a yokel, but these averages are still absolutely
_inconceivable_ to me. Our phones have as much RAM as my ‚Äústudio‚Äù work
desktop, now. 22.82 Mbps will reliably download _very_ complex web pages
nearly instantaneously. There is a very reasonable argument for
essential services like search engines and news websites to conform
to/adopt standards like AMP, but for the rest of The Open Web, ingenuity
and risktaking should be _encouraged_, not discouraged, for the true
good of all Peoplekind.

before referenced

massively disruptive success for decades now. But the iPhone's
depressing combination of

necessary or desirable ideal for the entirety of The Web, yet Google has
the audacity to presume it can dictate what is and is not optimal web
design. The URL in and of itself is extremely presumptuous ‚Äì Google
technically has every right to own web.dev, sure, but _should_ it? The
Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMP) program has already had an annoying
effect on day-to-day browsing. I despise AMP links more than most things
in life, just as I despise the name of the website _Search Engine Land_
(which sounds like actual hell) who
https://searchengineland.com/the-google-page-experience-update-user-experience-to-become-a-google-ranking-factor-335252[also
reported on this]:

____
If you have AMP, the good news is that the majority of AMP pages do
extremely well in terms of page experience metrics, [Google Project
Manager] Rudy Galfi said. It doesn‚Äôt mean that all AMP pages will have
top page experience metrics, but AMP is built in a way to help with
this.

Recently, I discovered an incredibly refreshing/affirming essay wrapped
in a hand-build web experience called
‚Äúhttps://neustadt.fr/essays/the-small-web/[Rediscovering the Small Web]‚Äù
by designer https://twitter.com/parimalsatyal[Parimal Satyal], arguing
for a different variety of Web presence:

____
Modern web design principles are very rarely directed at regular people
looking to make a website on something they are interested in. Instead,
the focus is on creating websites that perform well: _Don't use too many
colours. Write short, catchy headlines. Don't let content be too long.
Optimise for SEO. Produce video content, attention span is decreasing.
Have a an obvious call to action. Push your newsletter. Keep important
information above the fold. Don't make users think. Follow conventions._
____

I realize that the majority of Web utilization cannot ‚Äúrevert‚Äù to
hand-coded plain HTML web pages hosted on Neocities, but there's
something to be learned (or remembered, in my case) from Satyal's
argument: *The Web's forgotten strength is [.underline]#diversity#*
(much like my country's, it would seem,) and the majority of users are
being pushed by Google's search engine toward a very specific minority
of URLs. We have not been _exploring_ for a very long time:

____
Instead of browsing, the web is for many an endless and often
overwhelming stream of content and commentary picked out by algorithms
based on what they think you already like and will engage with. It's the
opposite of exploration.
____

‚ÄúIt is worth remembering a website does not have to be a product; it can
also be art,‚Äù argues Satyal. ‚ÄúThe web is also a creative and cultural
space that *need not confine itself to the conventions defined by
commercial product design and marketing*.‚Äù (Emphasis mine.) It's not
just that The Web was _meant_ to be more ‚Äì nostalgia is definitely not
my particular trip, if you didn't know ‚Äì it's that it _can_ be so much
more. My https://bilge.world/open[list of favorite Open Web projects]
contains just a few examples of what I mean.

It's possible I am being _too_ critical of Google. A

=== Basecamp's HEY matters, and not just because it took on Apple's App Store policies.

Something always worth celebrating: a considered, no-nonsense new effort
to reimagine email. I've lived through many notable milestones in this
regard: https://youtu.be/vN4U5FqrOdQ?t=2321[Apple Mail] on the original
iPhone, https://time.com/43263/gmail-10th-anniversary/[Gmail], Readdle's
https://www.theverge.com/2015/5/29/8683775/spark-email-app-iphone-apple-watch[Spark],
and (yes, really,) the revitalization of
https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/4/17819636/microsoft-resdesigned-outlook-windows-web[Microsoft's
Outlook]. Exciting innovations have abounded throughout email's history,
but it's highly debatable whether or not any of them have really changed
the way we use it in a profound way, yet I am unfailingly intrigued
whenever somebody new comes along, so when I saw
https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/15/21286466/hey-email-basecamp-price-availability-platforms-launch[Casey
Newton's story] on _The Verge_'s frontpage discussing Basecamp's
https://hey.com/[HEY] before I got out of bed on the morning of June
15th, I was delighted to see an organization still had the courage to
invest their confidence and resources into their Ideas About Email.
Originally,
http://web.archive.org/web/20200510220647/https://hey.com/[HEY's
homepage] included a prompt: ‚ÄúTo get on the list, email iwant@hey.com
and tell us how you feel about email. Could be a love story, or a hate
story. Could be long, could be short. It‚Äôs your story, so it‚Äôs up to
you.‚Äù Though I knew it'd likely never be read, I decided to write them a
letter about my personal history with email, which turned into an
entertaining enough anecdote to publish here.

The real reason HEY continued to be so widely covered by tech media,
though, was its challenge to Apple's App Store policies after one of its
updates was
https://www.protocol.com/hey-email-app-store-rejection[rejected by the
marketplace] just a day after Casey's story was published. Much drama
ensued ‚Äì I have done my best to aggregate links to all the news stories
on the subject in
https://www.reddit.com/r/extratown/comments/hbncn6/news_surrounding_hey_the_upcoming_email_service/[a
thread] on the https://www.reddit.com/r/extratown[_Extratone_ subreddit]
I recently started. I think
https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/16/21293419/hey-apple-rejection-ios-app-store-dhh-gangsters-antitrust[the
public resistance by Basecamp's CTO David Heinemeier Hansson] was
probably a PR move, which is fine, but all I wanted to contribute was a
review of the actual function of HEY, itself. After reading posts by
some of my favorite bloggers, however, I think it would be redundant.
Kev Quirk argued ‚Äúhttps://kevq.uk/email-is-not-broken/[Email Is Not
Broken],‚Äù to which Mike Stone responded
‚Äúhttps://mikestone.me/email-is-broken[Email Is Broken].‚Äù Additionally,
_Business Insider_'s Lisa Eadicicco published an
https://www.businessinsider.com/hey-email-app-review-basecamp-inbox-2020-7[in-depth
review] at the beginning of the month.

My singular commentary: I'm worried that subscription services that
exclusively accept large yearly sums like HEY inevitably become the
‚Äúcountry club for the most self-important emailers in business‚Äù which
Casey spoke of. I guess we'll see.

_The following is an excerpt from http://simp.ly/p/lw0h0R[my letter to
HEY] asking for a early-access invite._

[[section0091.xhtml#email-and-i-an-abridged-history]]
=== Email and I: An Abridged History

I am 26 years old, so I suppose I'm of the first generation that's never
experienced life _without_ email. I grew up on a farm in rural central
Missouri and my dad was very much an early adopter. (You'd be surprised
how e-enabled farmers were becoming in the early 2000s.) I cannot
remember life before the humongous satellite dish was anchored in our
front yard. Long before I had any reason to be online (or really
understood what that meant,) he began and ended every day sitting at in
front of a CRT on a corner desk, clacking away on a cigarette
smoke-yellowed plastic keyboard for hours. I did not understand why,
then, but in retrospect I realize that he was corresponding with a huge
network of neighbors, politicians, family, and college friends via email
lists/chains and that he depended on it both professionally and
personally in a big way. As a single man living at least an hour's drive
from a city of any size, I suppose my dad was predisposed to have a rich
online life long before his suburban peers, which normalized it
precociously for me.

The summer before my first grade year, my elementary school became the
first in the district to have a computer lab (also the first
air-conditioned room in the building,) so my high school graduating
class was literally the very first to have had any digital curriculum ‚Äì
and an email address(!) ‚Äì for the entirety of our public school
experience. Because of this, I think most of us were trained to think of
email as a tool for school work ‚Äì it was eluded to by our computer
teachers that our school email addresses were being monitored to make
sure they remained so (obviously, they weren't.) As we grew into 6th-7th
grade, however, we all seemed to end up with personal email addresses. I
consider myself lucky to have experienced a very brief window ‚Äì before
instant messaging/early social networks became mainstream and SMS became
even remotely pleasant to use ‚Äì when my middle school friends and I
corresponded exclusively by email when we weren't on the phone.

It still sounds a bit silly to say, but I've spent the past few years
coming to believe more and more strongly that my first-generation iPhone
changed my life forever in a profound way ‚Äì _especially_ my relationship
with email. After watching
https://www.howtogeek.com/674796/how-to-archive-or-delete-a-facebook-group/[Steve
Job's introduction at MacWorld 2007] live, I promised to skip a year of
Christmas gifts if my mom would agreed to buy me one, and she did.
Obviously, it was like nothing else I'd ever experienced, and it
completely changed how I responded to and thought about technology.
Before smartphones, there was no checking email outside of time in the
computer lab, which was intended to be quite strictly-regulated. I had a
real advantage when I started bringing my iPhone to school ‚Äì absolutely
no one knew what it was (a bizarre thought in contrast,) including
teachers. Suddenly able to browse and read my inbox in class, at lunch,
and on the bus, my use and consideration of email was propelled far
ahead of my peers'.

When I started an online magazine in 2016, I don't think I could've
conceived of the extent to which running a modern media company ‚Äì even
one targeted toward tech-savvy, early-adopting youth ‚Äì still involves
email. I assumed that my audience rarely _actually read_ from their
inboxes and relied almost exclusively on social networks for content
discovery, so I originally forwent any implementation of a newsletter.
As I grew more and more interested in and engaged with the media beat, I
was exposed to the email renaissance of the past 2-3 years thanks to
services like Revue and Substack, saw that it was good, and decided to
give it a try for myself. I launched our semi-regular newsletter in
April, 2017 on the subjects of ‚Äú*Division*, *Art*, and *Media*‚Äù and
published a little over 30 issues over the course of 18 months. To be
honest, I'm not sure I've ever had so much fun writing.

Very shortly after it began, I observed our general engagement
quadruple, and ‚Äì quite selfishly ‚Äì found the process of aggregation to
be soothing and very mentally restorative. It exposed some pretty
horrendous media consumption habits of mine, but it also offered a
painless solution to them. As soon as everything I read became a
potential item in the newsletter, I wasn't just reading for myself
anymore (or at least, that's the mentality it gave me,) so I could no
longer afford to dismiss particular subjects as easily or to skim so
recklessly. I nurtured a much less chaotic media diet and found myself
absorbing _a lot_ more of what I wanted to without wasting so much time
burning through links. I ended up feeling more focused in other,
unrelated areas of my life, too. Obviously, I love email for that, and I
miss writing that darn newsletter so much that I continuously look for
excuses to do something similar.

My former Tech Editor loved email perhaps as much, but she's definitely
the only person I've ever met who finds the medium as _entertaining_ as
I do. (If you're _really_ committed, I just made a
https://twitter.com/i/events/1272514574420500481?s=13[Twitter Moment]
full of all the best stuff I've ever posted about email ‚Äì mostly jokes
like ‚Äúhttps://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/921352650788130822[patron
saint of email marketing],‚Äù but there are one or two profound posts in
there, too.) We realized one day that ‚Äì aside from The Webbys ‚Äì there
are very few notable awards celebrating excellence in the email medium,
so we decided our magazine would host the 2017 First Annual Email
Awards. Unfortunately, I don't think anyone else had any idea what the
heck we were trying to do, so we never received enough submissions.
However, I noticed a great opening paragraph in the original
announcement post which I thought made a worthy conclusion:

____
Man has used electronic mail to intercommunicate, woo, build
communities, topple businesses & civilizations, embezzle money, spread
worms, distribute cluttered, broken links to discontinued Orscheln
products, feed infants, set climate control, confirm identities, check
bank account statuses, and lie to exhausted, slightly-conceited, and
_newly self-published_ professors. That's right ‚Äì These Trillions of
simple digijewels have purveyed _every single possible category of human
communication_, and it's still growing strong.
____

I'm excited to give Hey a try ‚Äì I hope you'll consider inviting me
early. I'll even send my feedback if you so desire it! If not, I'll
probably end up trying a paid subscription, anyway hehe. Either way, let
me wish the best of luck to your team. Win or lose, I'm glad you're
taking action on your complaints, unlike the rest of us.

Thank you!

=== Examining Fred Rogers' debut Atlantic-theatre naval anxiety compilation.

It's a little late to write about
https://letterboxd.com/film/greyhound/[_Greyhound_] ‚Äì Tom Hanks'
https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000158/#writer[first screenwriting credit]
‚Äì which released
https://tv.apple.com/us/movie/greyhound/umc.cmc.o5z5ztufuu3uv8lx7m0jcega[on
Apple TV+] this past Father's Day, June 21st. Though I definitely left
my quite severe obsession with WWII history in my prepubescence, I
thought I'd remark on this film because I originally hoped it would
fulfill a role I'd long wanted for: the destroyer-side compliment to
U-boat films like https://letterboxd.com/film/das-boot/[_Das Boot_] and
https://letterboxd.com/film/u-571/[_U-571_]. James D. Hornfischer's
exceptional account of the
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Samuel_B._Roberts_(DE-413)[U.S.S.
Samuel B. Roberts]' part in
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_off_Samar[The Battle off Samar]
with http://www.randomhousebooks.com/books/82865[_The Last Stand of the
Tin Can Sailors_] was my last dive into naval history. It's one of the
most astounding war stories I've ever encountered, and upon first seeing
https://youtu.be/eyzxu26-Wqk[_Greyhound_'s trailer], I was sortof hoping
it was the Big Boy film adaptation its always warranted. (Though
apparently there was a https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1068999/[TV movie]
made in 2005???) Instead, its based on (distinct from ‚Äúadapted from,‚Äù
apparently) a 1955 novel by English author C.S. Forester entitled
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/260852968364965888/737932123159265300/The_Good_Shepherd_-_C.S._Forester.pdf[_The
Good Shepherd_].

Tom Hanks made sure to imbue his first screenplay with a _shitload_ of
‚Äúhttps://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/jul/06/greyhound-review-tom-hanks-second-world-war-film[opaque
naval jargon],‚Äù as _The Guardian_'s Peter Bradshaw's review put it. A
brief
https://www.thecinemaholic.com/greyhound-ship-world-war-ii/[‚Äúinvestigation‚Äù
by _The Cinemaholic_] suggests that the U.S.S. Keeling ‚Äì the film's
singular setting ‚Äì most resembles a
http://destroyerhistory.org/goldplater/mahanclass/[_Mahan_-class
destroyer], though none actually bore the name. For the actual
photography, the production made use of a surviving example of the
http://destroyerhistory.org/goldplater/mahanclass/[most mass-produced
destroyer] of all time:

____
When it came to shooting the film, instead of relying completely on
sets, the crew of ‚ÄòGreyhound‚Äô found another option. They used USS Kidd,
a real WWII destroyer, to film the journey of Greyhound. She is a
Fletcher-class destroyer and is named after Rear Admiral Isaac C. Kidd,
the first US flag officer to die during the Second World War.
____

As much as you're going to loathe it, I must include this commentary on
_Greyhound_'s historical accuracy if only because ‚Äì as a undoubtedly
mainstream film ‚Äì its been so widely and competently reviewed, already,
by real film writers. I am almost positive U-boats would rarely ‚Äì if
ever ‚Äì waste their precious few viable torpedo shots firing
ultra-close-range at the agile, super-speedy destroyers and destroyer
escorts that protected supply convoys, and I am _sure_ that none ever
bothered with _audibly addressing enemy ships_ over the radio in
English. I understand that dramatizing historic events is the core
function of _Greyhound_'s genre, but this particular addition was so
unbearably cheesy that it utterly decimates all of the experience's
hard-won context. Just look at a snippet from the first of two dialogues
in text:

____
Greyhound. Greyhound, Greyhound.

This is Gray Wolf.

We hunt you and your friends Eagle, Dicky and Harry.

We watch your ships sinking into the deep.

We hear the screams of your comrades as they die.

How many of them will there be before you join them?

The Gray Wolf is so very hungry.
____

I'm sure there's an essential academic film function which only similar
enemy taunts could perform and without which this screenplay would've
been _technically_ unsound, and ‚Äì if I were allowed supposition ‚Äì I
would venture to guess that America's Favorite Dad felt pressured to
bolster his first penning against easy gimmes for the Great Big
institution of cinema criticism as much as possible. _However_, this
shit is just disruptingly cheesy. Fuck it! Have the rest:

____
Greyhound!

Your flock is not safe from this wolf.

We can always find you in the night to kill you.

Or will Dicky die next? Or Harry?

{empty}[Gray Wolf howls]

...

Greyhound.

Guten Morgen, Greyhound.

Did you think you had slipped away from this Gray Wolf?

No, you did not. You will not.

The sea favors the Gray Wolf on the hunt, not the hound on the run.

You and your comrades will die today.
____

The contrast with the rest of the script's imposingly thorough and
relentlessly-paced naval action dialogue is far too abrupt to _not_ be
problematic. Even as obsessed as I was with naval history, I'm still too
oblivious to the details of what is/was actually said on the bridge of a
warship during combat maneuvers to tell you how authentic _Greyhound_'s
depiction really is (it's hardly ever shown on the screen or laid out in
nonfiction, even,) which nullifies all relevance the realism would've
had, otherwise. Director Aaron Schneider in
https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2020/07/greyhound-movie-tom-hanks-aaron-schneider[an
interview for _Vanity Fair_]:

____
‚ÄúIf you decide to read _Greyhound_ by tracking the dialogue‚Äîrudder
commands and sonar distances‚Äîyou‚Äôll soon find yourself completely lost.
Because that‚Äôs not where the movie lives. This screenplay was designed
to beam you aboard the USS _Keeling_‚Ä¶and it‚Äôs up to you to engage with
what‚Äôs going on and extrapolate how things work, so you can answer the
question, ‚ÄòWhat the hell is going on here?‚Äô‚Äù
____

In this sense ‚Äì crafting a consuming, believable, unbelievably gray,
claustrophobic, icing iron reality ‚Äì Tom Hanks excels.

Though Letterboxd user https://letterboxd.com/brucewayn/[brucewayn]
called it ‚Äúboring‚Äù in
https://letterboxd.com/brucewayn/film/greyhound/[the most popular review
of the film] to date on the platform, I found _Greyhound_ to be quite
engaging in an anxious, depressing sense familiar to classic war dramas
like _Saving Private Ryan_ and _Black Hawk Down_. The tedium of naval
warfare's endless orienteering is rescaled to a battlefield of lesser
distances ‚Äì axis and allied vessels actually collide on several
occasions and a U-boat crew decides to _fuck it all_ and brawl it out
with two parallel destroyers with surface guns instead of retreating
after losing their ability to dive. (See:
https://youtu.be/4uOcE_IIi30[_Titanic VI_].) Through a combination of
wartime compression and stitching, _Greyhound_ is in large part a mashup
of naval action at the extremes of what historical fiction will allow
within its 48-hour setting. From Ben Lindbergh's
https://www.theringer.com/movies/2020/7/9/21318481/tom-hanks-greyhound-review[review
for _The Ringer_]:

____
In _The Good Shepherd_, enemy torpedoes simply sail wide; in the movie,
they graze the hull for even closer calls. In the book, Krause agonizes
over, and generally resists, calling the crew to general quarters, wary
of exhausting their energy reserves; in the movie, he doesn‚Äôt hesitate
to summon his sailors to battle stations.
____

The result is an emotionally effective film constrained by a very
specific dramatic aim: another war movie every father can juice for
decades' worth of Sunday afternoons on the sofa. ‚ÄúAs befits his status
as America's Dad, Hanks has constructed for us the ultimate Dad Movie ‚Äî
all the action you could ever need or want, with no annoying characters
hanging around, harboring pesky needs and wants of their own,‚Äù
https://www.npr.org/2020/07/10/888899608/world-war-ii-naval-drama-greyhound-charts-a-trim-efficient-course[quips
Glen Weldon for _NPR_]. Undoubtedly, though, the subject matter is
fresh. I wouldn't say my youth desire for a surface-side
Atlantic-theatre film is 100% satiated, but _Greyhound_ managed to
accomplish much more than I expected.

[[section0093.xhtml#i-ve-got-some-fucking-opinions-about-soundcloud]]
=== I‚Äôve got some fucking opinions about SoundCloud‚Ä¶

My friend Sierra has used SoundCloud almost exclusively for her music
discovery, consumption, and recommendations, but has remained resolute
in her unwillingness to financially invest in the service. As such, her
listening is regularly interrupted by ads and limited to bitrates
https://www.magneticmag.com/2018/01/soundcloud-lowers-sound-quality-uploads-half/[as
low as 64kbps]. Since I was last employed, I have maintained a vow to
her that I would pay for a subscription to SoundCloud Go+ ‚Äì the premium
_listener_ tier of the service ‚Äì with my own money, once I was once
again in place at a steady job. This move would remove all advertising
from her listening and
https://help.soundcloud.com/hc/en-us/articles/360010227514-High-Quality-Streaming[up
its bitrate to 256kbps], among https://checkout.soundcloud.com/go[other
benefits].

Two nights ago, we were refueling her car in preparation for another one
of our recreational drives into rural Missouri when I made the decision
on a whim to simply signup for a trial of Go+ on
https://soundcloud.com/chordoslut[my own account] using Apple Pay,
mostly because I knew we‚Äôd be going out of effective cell network range
and one of Go+‚Äôs most emphasized features is its ability to download
music locally. (Since my Apple Music subscription expired earlier this
year, I only have https://bigkrit.com/music/king-remembered-in-time/[a
single album] actually downloaded on my phone.)

https://soundcloud.com/keithjarrettofficial/rio-part-v

*** The above is what I wrote several weeks ago, just as I was beginning
my trial period. Now, having experienced a significant amount of time as
a SoundCloud Go user, I am a bit sad that my trial is over. To be
honest, I fully intended to become a paying subscriber, but my PayPal
account was $0.70 short of the $12.99 monthly fee when the first billing
cycle came, two weeks ago. This is not a conclusion I expected to come
to, as SoundCloud‚Äôs fundamental arrangement could not possibly differ
any more from the music streaming service I long claimed as my ideal
own: Apple Music.

One major worry I would imagine potential subscribers may have when
approaching SoundCloud as a replacement for their single music
subscription service would revolve around the extent of SoundCloud‚Äôs
establishment music industry library. There‚Äôs no way your Dad‚Äôs Sunday
barbecue playlist is going to be on _SoundCloud_, right? Strangely
enough, I was unable to find a single track that _was not_ in the
library. From my own favorite
https://soundcloud.com/keithjarrettofficial[Keith Jarrett‚Äôs archives] to
https://soundcloud.com/dixiechicks/sets/gaslighter-2[the new Dixie
Chicks album], every bit of big time record label-distributed music I
could conceieve of could be found aside the Go+ badge (though notably,
neither of these showed significant playcounts.) As far as the app
experience goes, I _swear_ it got smoother as soon as I signed up for
Go+. This is probably bullshit, but regardless, with the seemingly
ever-widening disparity in the experiences of free vs. premium users,
SoundCloud appears to be moving actively away from the former.

image:xhtml/https:/i.snap.as/78HwnfKK.png[SoundCloud Desktop Keyboard
Shortcuts]

I have long said (somewhat in jest) that
https://soundcloud.com/chancetherapper[Chance The Rapper] is the only
reason SoundCloud still exists.

____
From a future historian‚Äôs perspective, the battle for the definitive
name in independent digital music distribution has already won, largely
thanks to its relationship with Chance The Rapper, who‚Äôs quickly become

If __https://www.cnet.com/news/chance-the-rapper-soundcloud/[CNET_ was
asking the question] a year before that Bandcamp essay, I think I can
feel properly varified. What I‚Äôd really like to know, now: does Chance
still feel the same way about the streaming service after the launch of
SoundCloud Go+? Considering that I am far from a _real_ music
journalist, I do not have any more contact resources than you have. That
said, I left [a comment on his Facebook
Page](https://www.facebook.com/chancetherapper/posts/3299672310124810?comment=[https://www.facebook.com/chancetherapper/posts/3299672310124810?comment]__id=3319045628187478).
I guess we‚Äôll see.

Some more technical bits: SoundCloud is now castable on Chromecast, but
_not_ supported by Apple CarPlay, for whatever that‚Äôs worth. Notably
apart from Bandcamp and Apple Music and aligned with Spotify, SoundCloud
is explicitly investing in algorithmic music discovery, which means its
users are doing the curatorial work. _I_ am doing/have done the
curatorial work. That means the DnB crowd is going to receieve Toto
recommendations, given what I sought out for this post. You‚Äôre welcome,
and sorry‚Ä¶

. While I was surprisingly unable to find any Tweets or Evernotes
further evangelizing Apple Music (I suspect I‚Äôm thinking of an old,
untranscribed _Drycast_ episode,) I found real magic in the service as I
perceieved it: $9.99 a month for _all of iTunes_. 13 year-old me would
considerthat one helluva deal.
. Naturally, if you know of one, please do comment and/or
https://www.davidblue.wtf/contact/[drop me a line].
. In fact, it is the only streaming app I found that _does not _have
CarPlay support. Even Bandcamp and MixCloud for iOS do!

=== An attempt to fix a Windows Insider Build issue led to soft-bricking my Surface Laptop 2.

I finally did it, ladies and gentlemen... I managed to break the Windows
installation on my https://www.davidblue.wtf/t/surface/[Microsoft
Surface Laptop 2] to such an extent that it has been unrecoverable. I am
currently borrowing my mother's MacBook Pro and waiting on a Windows 10
installation .ISO file to download so that I can hope to mount it
correctly on the last, shitty USB thumb drive I still have lying around.

image:xhtml/https:/i.snap.as/GG9y4pmC.png[Fuck Grammarly]

_YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT BITCH._

I now suspect I began down this path a few months ago when I discovered
https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2020/06/15/introducing-windows-insider-channels/[Windows
Insider Channels] and rejoiced... As I've discovered that one can
relatively easily find a beta version of virtually _any_ piece of
software, it's become a bit of a habit for me. More or less
unconsciously, I‚Äôve ended up with an application library full of
_Developer Beta_ and _Nightly_ _Build_-type shit. I don't think there
was/is a single web browser installed on that machine that is not the
given entity's ‚ÄúDeveloper Edition‚Äù which ‚Äì considering most of the
regular installs allow you to opt into dev tools, anyway ‚Äì seem like
they might be redundant. I don't particularly care, anymore ‚Äì I mostly
just love their icons.
https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/developer/[Firefox Developer
Edition]'s logo is a blue Firefox(!,)
https://www.microsoftedgeinsider.com/en-us/download[Edge Chromium Dev]'s
is... more interesting than the regular version.
https://www.google.com/chrome/canary/[Google Chrome Canary]'s icon is a
surprisingly-tasteful variation of the company's usually-horrendous
color palette.

What I'm trying to say is... I have continued upon this habit of opting
for unstable versions of software in a sort of defiance against the
common sense notion that relying upon them is generally a _bad
idea_.[^1] I suppose I was just *waiting to experience any consequences*
from such a decision, and well... Here they are!

It all began when my Surface's integrated webcam became invisible to all
applications that used a video input ‚Äì including Microsoft's own Camera
app and OBS. It showed up in Device Manger, where I did the
generally-recommended troubleshooting task of uninstalling it completely
(including its drivers) and rebooting to force Windows to reinstall it.
It did so successfully every time, to no effect on the original issue. I
also went into the Surface's BIOS menu, where its hardware devices are
explicitly listed, and disabled/re-enabled the camera, to no effect.
Normally, the absence of a webcam function would be more or less
irrelevant to my day-to-day workflow, but now that
https://www.davidblue.wtf/college-return/[I'm partaking in ‚Äúvirtual‚Äù
college courses], at least one of my professors has pressured me to
appear _on cam_ as soon as possible.

On Sunday night, I decided to revisit the problem with greater
commitment, diving into a variety of deeper troubleshooting steps which
I do not recall. The crucial one, though, was my decision to use the
System File Checker tool `(sfc /scannow)` with the added instruction to
_fix_ whatever errors it found.[^2] This drove my dearest little laptop
into a cycle of self-diagnoses which results in an option screen
including ‚ÄúReset PC.‚Äù After trying virtually every other option, I
decided to try resetting, only to be met with connectivity error
messages after pursuing the ‚ÄúInstall via Network‚Äù option, leaving the
use of a bootable Windows 10 recovery USB as my only choice, in theory.

Another problem now arose: my mother's MacBook Pro is the only other
machine I have any sort of access to at the moment, and MacOS no longer
supports the creation of such a bootable USB for Windows via the Boot
Camp Utility any longer. Nevertheless, I tried to make one by
downloading the correct OS ISO and mounting it via UNetbootin, which
didn't work. I then called https://www.colcomputers.com/[Columbia
Computer Center], who very generously agreed to make one for me and only
charge me for the drive itself ($10!)

Unfortunately, that one hasn't worked either, so I'm afraid I'm just
going to have to take the thing to them...
https://www.davidblue.wtf/t/surface/[Stay tuned] for the Final Verdict.

[1] This is why I‚Äôve always downloaded the developer iOS beta releases
on my actual, daily driver handset.

=== I bought a desktop tower for the first time since 2010 and spent an embarrassingly long time struggling with Bluetooth shit.

As with my https://bilge.world/hp-spectre-x360-review[entire history] of
computer purchases, my acquisition of an
https://support.hp.com/us-en/document/c06443577[HP ENVY Desktop tower],
today, was last-minute, ill-informed, and certainly irrational. You ‚ÄúPC
master race‚Äù folk: please spare me the _dude, you could've just built
your own pc so much cheaper_ shit.[^1] Yes, I realize the sensible
course of action would've begun with a two hour trip West to the closest
Microcenter, where I'm sure the staff would've made PC shopping an
absolute blast and I would've come away with a more powerful, much
cheaper machine. However, after I managed to
https://www.davidblue.wtf/finally-broke-windows/[break Windows] on my
only machine this weekend (and subsequently failed to reset it,) I was
getting especially behind on schoolwork and had _absolutely no desire_
to complete any of it on my iPhone.

And so... I've just returned from picking up said HP Tower along with a
https://store.hp.com/us/en/pdp/hp-27f-27-inch-display#![27‚Äù HP LED
display], and am writing you after having set up the machine physically
and installed most of my ‚Äúessential software‚Äù list (at least all that I
could remember.) As per my favorite tradition of new computer
acquisition, I have named the machine after
https://fortitude.fandom.com/wiki/Hildur_Odegard[Hildur Odegard] from
_Fortitude_.

[[section0095.xhtml#first-impressions]]
=== ‚ÄúFirst Impressions‚Äù

It's been exactly 10 years since I last bought a desktop tower ‚Äì since I
first set hands on the Dell XPS Studio desktop with which I would create
the majority of my intellectual property ‚Äì and I was immediately
surprised by how much smaller (6.12 x 11.93 x 13.28 inches) and lighter
(13.12 lbs.) this tower was than my expectations. The display, too, is
remarkably light and thin. Rationally, I should not have been surprised
by this, but I'm not going to punish myself for continuing to find any
sort of magic in technology.

In the box were a Bluetooth keyboard ‚Äì specifically, an HP model
https://fccid.io/EMJKHSA-P003K[4251a-khsap003k] ‚Äì and mouse set, the
latter of which I will hopefully never have to use, thanks to my
https://youtu.be/oIAY1-aW8Es[Logitech G203] ‚Äì and was perplexed by the
process of how to pair the former with the tower while it was in setup
mode for far too long. I was just about to give up entirely when I
revisited the packaging and noticed what I'd previously assumed was an
anti-theft device, but was actually the fucking dongle for the pair. I
continue to despise Bluetooth peripherals, obviously, but the multimedia
function keys of the product led to some important realizations: I now
had reason to use Windows Desktop Switching _and_ have a calculator
application again! However, I have yet to figure out how to alter the
Function key's behavior (I'm not even sure it's possible:) in order to
input *Alt+F4*, I have to input *Fn+Alt+F4*, which is far too clunky to
depend on. The issue did lead to a revelation which I may or may not
integrate permanently: I mapped *Alt+F4* to the previously-unused button
on the very top of the G203. So far, it's been pretty nifty.

_The HP 4251a-khsap003k included in the box with my new HP desktop._

That said, a component of my intention to create an intentional, static,
upright-sitting desktop workspace included an allotment for a quality
mechanical keyboard ‚Äì my justification was that any professional in a
particular craft makes a point to have the best possible tools for the
job, so a high-quality keyboard has actually been _very_ long overdue,
in my case. So, I sought out
https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/our-favorite-mechanical-keyboards/[a
single _Wirecutter_ recommendations list] and even attempted to
disseminate
https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/[r/MechanicalKeyboards].[^2]
After a brief jaunt, I concluded that no reasonable person would be able
to make heads or tails of the forum or
https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/wiki/index[its seemingly
endless wikis] without considerable indoctrination so I more or less
threw a dart and landed on the
https://mechanicalkeyboards.com/shop/index.php?l=product_detail&p=3504[Varmilo
VA108M], which I ordered. All I know is that it's fairly highly-reviewed
on the marketplaces I checked (though hardly mentioned on the subreddit,
actually,) and that it has the _Cherry Switches_, which are...

A concern I originally had with taking over the tertiary guest room ‚Äì by
far the smallest allotted living space in the house ‚Äì as my office was
its distance from our wireless router, two floors down. The last time I
used the room as a workspace (five years ago,) my old tower's integrated
WiFi card often struggled to maintain a reliable connection. The adapter
included in this desktop, though, actually managed to clock

https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/surface/business/surface-laptop-2[Surface
Laptop 2]'s *2256 x 1504 13‚Äù* display after years of hard, daily use.
Apparently, those dimensions mean the little machine's display has a
pixel density of *201 Pixels-Per-Inch*. Filling a *27‚Äù* display with
just *1920 x 1080* means a pixel density of just *81.6
Pixels-Per-Inch*,[^3] and the disparity was glaring to my eyes, even
from the setup screen. After a few hours of regular use, I'm not sure I
notice it anymore, but I suspect I will again when I've got the laptop
running again. Please do indicate whether or not you think such a
complaint makes me awful in the https://poll.fm/10603399[Crowdsignal

https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/1301337431887708162

I've also already had trouble connecting my

SoundLink headphones] correctly via Bluetooth. On my Surface Laptop, it
registered as two separate devices ‚Äì ‚ÄúStereo Headphones‚Äù and ‚ÄúHeadset‚Äù ‚Äì
which allowed me to use them as both the primary audio output _and_ the
primary audio input. For whatever reason, I have been unable to
accomplish such a simultaneous connection on this machine: I can either
connect them as headphones or as a headset, but not both.

that I have to open Sound Settings and manually connect the headphones
every time I re-connect them. Hopefully, I'll figure out another
solution soon.

Returning to the webcam issue: I discovered that absolutely _zero_ local
stores keep add-on webcams in stock anymore, which makes sense. I
resorted to searching Amazon for webcams and found a gargantuan list of
brands I had never heard of. When I filtered by the one I _did_
recognize ‚Äì Logitech ‚Äì I saw barely-facelifted versions of the camera my
stepdad bought in 2008 and none were in stock. Unwilling to further
investigate or research more, I set the price filter for under $40,
sorted by customer ratings, and bought the first product which had even
remotely legitimate-looking reviews:

Yes, I bought a mechanical keyboard. It occurred to me that folks who
spend a lot of time doing things that require tools ‚Äì _professionals_,
artisans, craftsmen, etc. ‚Äì usually seek out the best possible quality
offerings of those tools. Even if they're just 5% better than the
average alternatives and cost twice as much, when one uses them for
hours every day, the last bit of refinement pays off very quickly.
Considering how much typing I've done in the past 5-10 years, I find it
a bit silly that I hadn't before thought to optimize the hardware I've
used to do so. Now that I've put at least some thought into designing
the space in which I work and
https://www.davidblue.wtf/college-return/[gone back to school], I've
also invested in bettering the thing my hands actually touch the most.

(I had difficulty finding it, too.)

I suppose I've let myself be blinded to the advantages of a mechanical
keyboard by the _gaemer_ stigma that surrounds them. This time, I
believe I began by simply inputting something like ‚Äúbest keyboard for
typing‚Äù into a search engine, which returns plenty of iffy results,
naturally, but among them was
https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/our-favorite-mechanical-keyboards/[a
list from _Wirecutter_] ‚Äì whom I trust, more or less ‚Äì of ‚ÄúBest
Mechanical Keyboards 2020.‚Äù Also included were posts in the
https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/[r/MechanicalKeyboards
subreddit], which I _actually fucking joined_[^1] (but promise never to
mention again outside of this post.) Uncovering my eyes, I found a
ridiculously-extensive community message board and
https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/wiki[Wiki], which is
undoubtedly the most extensive resource on the subject to be found,
anywhere. Though I did place a time limit on myself for any research of
15 minutes, in retrospect, I suppose I also had some criteria, which I
assume ‚Äì if you're still reading ‚Äì you might be interested in:

* *WIRED* as fuck. Bluetooth can _fuck off_.
* ‚ÄúFull‚Äù keyboard, for the same reason I'd never spend any money on a
piano with any less than 88 keys.
* At least tolerably tasteful, aesthetically. (Not overwhelmingly
embarrassing if someone were to actually see me using it.)
* Cute, ideally.
* No light shows.
* Not ‚Äúergonomic.‚Äù
* Not from Logitech or Microsoft.

Immediately, it was overwhelmingly clear that my choice must also have
_The Cherry_... The Cherries... The ‚ÄúCherry MX Switches,‚Äù whatever they
are. _Any_ of even the most skimmy reading up on the subject will lead
you to this conclusion. That addressed, I arrived upon three
considerations: the

As good as the idea of something as German as the Das Keyboard sounded,
I hate the way it looks, and the Ducky seemed to take itself too
seriously (despite its brand name.) The VA87M seemed to be ideal if it
was full-sized. I searched for the equivalent,
http://mechanicalkeyboards.com/shop/index.php?l=product_detail&p=2855[found
the VA108M], and bought one immediately. Specifically...

I've already written more than I ever wanted to, but let me just say
that I love everything about the thing ‚Äì the particular set of special
keys, the way it feels & sounds, and that its heft prevents it from
moving around ‚Äì and I hope to keep it forever. As I said on the
photographs I posted to social media, *I promise to never bring this or
any other mechanical keyboard up ever again* unless asked about it.

[1] Yes, I have actually been using the Read It website in the past 18

just say I‚Äôve unblocked it within my psyche largely because it‚Äôs no
longer horrendous to look at.

matters, considering they are only visible when the keycaps have been

which was largely dominated by Dark Mode, the iPad OS fork, and Memoji ‚Äì
which I could care less about, honestly ‚Äì and didn‚Äôt warrant my

welcome, but I‚Äôd departed from iCloud as my primary storage service, so
I didn‚Äôt have anything relevant to say. iOS 14 is also mostly irrelevant

philosophy that I thought was worth commenting on. For myself,
everything about it adds anxiety, beginning with the launch, itself, at

=== I do not want to live on the Memoji planet.

My technology writing over the years has largely centered around my awe
and confusion regarding what I've perceived as a divergent path from the
future I once imagined. My closest guess as to this divergence's origin
is the announcement of iOS7, with Apple's
https://www.theguardian.com/technology/shortcuts/2013/jun/12/skeuomorphism-apple-ditched-ios7[abandonment
of skeuomorphic design] in favor of an entirely new, ‚Äúflatter‚Äù UX visual

to you already.)

Thanks to The Big Beer Virus, this was Apple's first pre-recorded WWDC

Keynote to ‚Äúgo live,‚Äù the stream was occupied by an

grow closer to this Earth, gradually revealing that it was covered with
millions of floating memoji in various states behind their animated
MacBooks. Like much of the event to follow, this scene became more and
more anxiety-inducing as we grew closer to the mob (keep in mind that
I've never really found memoji cute, unlike plenty of folks.)
Eventually, we changed pitch dramatically and plunged through a hole in
the clouds straight toward the incenter of the spaceship at Apple Park,
through the door, down the staircase, and into a completely empty ‚Äì but

I would go into detail, but I'm honestly not all that curious about the
process, which is unusual. I hope more than anything that I am not
loosing my curiosity or playfulness regarding iOS which not so long ago
propelled https://bilge.world/siri-shortcuts-ios12-review[an exuberant
exploration of Shortcuts' capabilities] during their early days as an
integrated Apple property with the release of iOS 12.

https://twitter.com/ragulover123/status/1307461503948394496

Basically, I'm not going to do the full bit, this year, but I'd like to
address some of the notes I _did_ take throughout the past few months of
the developer beta. Notably, there is simply far less to iOS 14 that's
relevant to my life, personally, than any other release I remember, _but
that's okay_. It's just a wee bit more difficult to motivate myself to
talk about it. If there's one definite statement to be made about this
release, it's that *it is _additive_ rather than _transformative_*. As
Dieter Bohn so elequently put it for _The Verge_:

____
For the iPhone, the overarching theme is that they're finally letting it
get complicated. The home screen starts simple, but it can be complex if
you want it to and Apple's also finally putting different elements on
top of other elements so you can see Siri on top of your current screen
instead of taking over the whole screen.

Verge_

_Yes, I do find the title of that article quite ironic considering what
I just articulated to you._

The title of
https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/24/21299924/ios-14-iphone-wwdc-2020-apple-home-screen-widgets-app-library-clips-pages-complexity[his
penultimate review], additionally, includes the summation ‚ÄúApple is
finally lettting the iPhone homescreen get complicated.‚Äù Yes...
_Complexity_. I'll be honest: I've actually had the opportunity to play
around quite a bit with Android 11 thanks to Android Studio on my PCs,
and I found it tremendously underwhelming as an alternative. On a
virtual Pixel 3, the experience was functionally no more than a fucking
_material design_-tasting, _slightly_ varied execution of a smartphone
operating system in comparison. I should disclaim, though, that these
weeks with early iOS widget implementation ‚Äì which represents quite a
hefty chunk of this release's significance, I think we can all agree ‚Äì
have led me to the conclusion that I personally _do not believe_ in
widgets. Or at least ‚Äì I do not have the usership vocabulary to even
begin integrating them into my own handset-using life.[efn_note]I'd
elaborate but honestly, who cares, really?[/efn_note]

To focus a bit, let's look specifically at a _Gizmodo_ article published
this past Wednesday:
‚Äúhttps://gizmodo.com/17-things-you-can-do-in-ios-14-that-you-couldn-t-do-bef-1844975020[17
Things You Can Do in iOS 14 That You Couldn‚Äôt Do Before]:‚Äù

. *App Clips*: Oh boy... I'm so physically, mentally, and spiritually
exhausted. Just gonna say _no_ to that one.
. *Add widgets to the home screen*: I'm going to assume it's Android
users who've stigmatised dynamic home screen widgets as a desirable
outlet of development resources. I simply cannot fathom any bit of data
which would be truly be _constructively_ consumed there, as opposed to
unlocking the device and navigating to whatever application it
originated from. Perhaps I'm just old and slow.
. *Send apps to the App Library*: Directly related, actually. Still
considering how I assume most folks actually navigate to applications
that have been in folders or in secondary+ homescreens to date ‚Äì that
is, dragging down and typing a handful of characters into Spotlight
search ‚Äì I'm not sure an alphabetized listing of all apps is really that
useful. I know I'm not alone on this one: iJustine expressed an
identical assumption
https://anchor.fm/samebrain/episodes/WWDC-Rumors--PS5-hype-and-Animal-Crossing-efmf8f[on
an episode of her podcast, _Same Brain_].
. *Hide some of your home screens*: (I repeat the exact same argument.)
. *Watch videos with picture-in-picture mode*: Once again, I could
definitely be showing my age, but what really constitues _watching_ when
you're talking about a fractional segment of a ~6 inch display? You may
as well just be listening to the audio, right?
. *Pin conversations in Messages*: I'm afraid the text conversation
pinning feature doesn't really apply to someone like myself, who
literally never messages anyone but my girlfriend and my mom. All
pinning the conversations accomplishes for me is the obfuscation of the
handy in-line timestamp found in the normal list view.
. *Mention your contacts in Messages*: Jesus... And we're still using
fucking _SMS_?
. *Add more variety to your memojis*: I still have not figured out how
to actually use memojies, practically, so...
. *Get suggested smart home automations*: I'm sorry... What did you say?
I'm not familiar with those words.
. *Get to bed on time*: Clarification: ‚ÄúiOS 14 works with watchOS 7 (or
on its own) to help you get to sleep at the right time each night, with
reminders and Do Not Disturb options.‚Äù If you were truly _at all_
interested in not being disturbed _or_ getting lots of sleep, you
wouldn't have spent $300 on a machine to strap to your wrist who's
*primary function* is to disturb you!
. *Translate websites in Safari*: Christ... _Really_? How have I not
encountered an issue with this before?
. *Search inside apps*: *There we go!* The first item on this list that
suggests anyone at Apple _actually uses iOS_!
. *Get more detailed weather forecasts*: Dark Sky acquision... All this
one does is remind me that Apple's self-restraint could breach at any
time and essentially the only competent mobile weather app ever devised
could die or be molested into irrelevance.
. *Use your iPhone as a translator*: Well... Yeah... Anything that
convenienctly allows me to reduce dependence on Google, I guess!
. *Get more facts from Siri*: ..._lol_ +
‚ÄúApple says Siri knows more facts than ever before, though it hasn‚Äôt
offered up any specific examples of something it knows in iOS 14 that it
didn‚Äôt know in iOS 13‚Äîyou‚Äôll have to try and test it out yourself.
According to Apple, Siri now knows 20 times the number of facts that it
did three years ago, and we haven‚Äôt been able to catch it out with
anything so far.‚Äù
. *Get cycling directions in Apple Maps*: No! Cut that out!
. *Plan a journey in an electric vehicle*: I'm not joking when I suggest
that this fits perfectly into iOS 14's _Anxiety Mode Enchancement_
theme: all this really means is _We've added the new Apple Range Anxiety
app_!

https://davidblue.wtf/columbiaguide[David Blue's Guide to Columbia,
Missouri] renders surprisingly beautifully on a desktop browser.

Yes, there _are_ examples of genuine progress. The Guides feature in
Maps (seen above) probably could/should have been added a long time ago,
but at least Apple executed it quite elegantly. I'm could've _sworn_
sharing your ETA has been possible from within Maps since like... iOS 7
or something, but perhaps I was thinking of
https://apps.apple.com/us/app/waze-navigation-live-traffic/id323229106[Waze].
*Wallpapers for CarPlay* are one of those features that didn‚Äôt occur to
me to want, but I did/do. Also ‚Äì though my personal experience with
CarPlay has been limited ‚Äì I can definitely imagine more layout options
(‚ÄúHorizontal status bar‚Äù) will be useful in _fringe_ use cases.

And that's it! All of my notes have now been crossed off! Now I can
finally forget I ever spent time thinking about iOS this year... Gourd
Bless.

_You have a desire for indulgence in your home and family_,
https://www.costarastrology.com/neoyokel[Co-Star] has just told me in my
weekly, email newsletter-delivered horoscope. ‚ÄúVenus conjunct to natal
Moon‚Äù indicates _this part of yourself will transform into something
else_, and goes on to say something truly stirring: **the way you relate
to your past is changing**. I continue to be amazed by how influential
the potential of the computing hardware present in my life at any given
time can be on my habits. In the two weeks I‚Äôve had
https://www.davidblue.wtf/hp-envy-desktop/[my first moderately powerful
desktop computer] in over ten years, I have found myself using new image
& video editing software, installing local WordPress stacks, finally
experimenting with Git, somehow generating 20 draft posts on
https://www.davidblue.wtf/[a fresh experimental WordPress site], and
putting my whole back into my new Notion account, including ‚Äì among
others ‚Äì projects like my
‚Äúhttps://www.notion.so/rotund/Keyboard-Shortcuts-Wiki-9b4567d5b41447638cd6330aed7c2a1b[Keyboard

deliberate, focused sort of digital existence: reflection on
https://www.kevinmcgillivray.net/word/[Kevin McGillivray‚Äôs Word of The
Year concept],
https://tomcritchlow.com/blogchains/digital-gardens/[digital gardening],
and a few other like discoveries have culminated in a newfound, unironic
use of the term
‚Äúhttps://www.notion.so/rotund/Creative-Wellness-b43e3df6f4b94333aa97ea98b67cb760[Creative
Wellness]‚Äù to describe a set of ideologies which I believe I should
strive for in order to improve my intellectual wellbeing.

In tandem with the fact that I have
https://www.davidblue.wtf/college-return/[gone back to school], this has
all crucially resulted in very little _actual writing_, which may or may
not be conclusive evidence toward the classical minimalist technology
argument that less capability results in more focus. On that note,
remember when
https://www.theverge.com/2014/5/14/5716232/george-r-r-martin-uses-dos-wordstar-to-write[the
_Game of Thrones_ author appeared on Conan‚Äôs show] and mentioned that he
still writes exclusively using WordStar 4.0? This happening has been
vaguely in the back of my mind since I encountered it during the
relatively brief, basement apartment-dwelling era in Oregon when I first
discovered WinWorldPC and got into running a bunch of DOS VMs, trying
out every download from that blessed site which sounded even remotely
interesting. Before I go on, let me just include a transcript of the
entire anecdote I‚Äôm referring to here, because it‚Äôs actually much
shorter than one is led to believe:

____
*Conan*: These novels that that you write are can be over a thousand
pages long. They're massive tomes and apparently you write them all on a
computer, but unlike most authors, you're not worried about a computer
virus. I mean an author who writes a thousand-page book their greatest
fear is a virus invades and destroys a chunk of their book you don't
worry about that. Why?

*Martin*: No I have a secret weapon ‚Äì I actually have two computers: I
have the computer that I browse the internet with and that I get my
email on and I do my taxes on and that computer and then I have my
writing computer which is a DOS machine not connected to the Internet.

*Conan*: A DOS machine. How old is this program?

*Martin*: A DOS machine. You remember DOS? I use WordStar 4.0 as my word
processing system.

*Conan*: Did you make this computer out of wood? Did you carve it? I'm
curious why you decided to stick with this old program.

*Martin*: I actually like it. I mean, it does everything I want a word
processing program to do, and it doesn't do anything else. I don't want
any help. I hate some of these modern systems where you type a lowercase
letter and it becomes a capital. I don't want a capital ‚Äì if I wanted a
capital, I would've typed a capital. I know how to work the shift key.
Stop fixing it!

*Conan*: You yell at computers a lot. What about spellcheck?

*Martin*: Oh, I hate spellcheck. Especially when you have the realm of
[???], it's [???].
____

That‚Äôs it! A less than sixty second exchange. I did not remember just
how much coverage it received on digital news sites. Embark on a Google
search for
‚Äúhttps://www.google.com/search?q=george+rr+martin+wordstar[george rr
martin wordstar],‚Äù and you‚Äôll discover a ridiculously long list of brief
stories including the YouTube embed. A book I‚Äôve just recently
discovered and begun ‚Äì which I am extremely excited about ‚Äì is Professor
Matthew G. Kirschenbaum‚Äôs
https://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674417076[_Track
Changes: A Literary History of Word Processing_], and its introduction
begins by mentioning _The George Thing_, which surely indicates that it
is the most significant mention of word processing software in popular
culture for at least a decade:

____
The clip was posted to YouTube and from there embedded in innumerable
tweets, Facebook feeds, and blogs. Some commenters immediately, if
indulgently, branded Martin a Luddite, while others opined it was no
wonder it was taking him so long to finish the whole story (or less
charitably, no wonder that it all seemed so interminable). But what was
it about these seemingly obscure details that people found so
compelling? Part of it was no doubt the unexpected blend of novelty and
nostalgia: Many fans would be old enough to remember WordStar for
themselves, and the intricacy of its interface seems somehow in keeping
with Martin‚Äôs quirky persona, part paternalistic grandfather and part
_Doctor Who_ character. WordStar thus becomes an accessory to his public
image, like the black fisherman‚Äôs cap he is frequently photographed
wearing. But it is also clearly much more than that. Martin‚Äôs passion
for the program is unmistakable...
____

The book, itself, was also more widely reviewed than one would expect,
where it was deemed genuinely unique. I _related_ quite hard to the
preface‚Äôs first few sentences:

____
_Track Changes_ began, as many books do, with a question: What was the
first novel written with a word processor? Being an English professor
interested in the history of writing as well as computers, I thought it
was the sort of thing I should know, but I didn‚Äôt.
____

Discovering the volume was a result of a personal determination in the
last week to give in to my latent obsession with word processing/text
editing software, which also led to my creating
https://www.notion.so/rotund/0f3f754d5a4b46cb99bd3e1c0a2e1159?v=a85e98bc06424b72a3a249a87cb62101[a
Notion table of every word processor I‚Äôve ever heard of]. Thanks to my
desktop PC acquisition, found myself virtual machining a bit again,
though some of the programs I‚Äôm particularly interested in trying have
inexplicitly disappeared from my personal library and been removed from
WinWorldPC, probably due to (mostly absurd) copyright claims. Most
versions of WordStar are https://winworldpc.com/product/wordstar[still
available], though, and I‚Äôll confess I still have a desire to learn how
to use its cult keyboard shortcuts,
https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2017/03/wordstar-a-writers-word-processor/[as
evangelized by Robert J. Sawyer in an essay] _also_ discussed in _Track
Changes_, which specifically shits on WordPerfect more explicitly than I
remembered. I keep returning to the idea that I should try writing the
stuff I normally work on ‚Äì like this post, for instance ‚Äì in these
software, but file transfer is a bigger and bigger obstacle the older
the OS you‚Äôre running: VirutalBox‚Äôs
‚Äúhttps://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch04.html[Guest Additions]‚Äù ‚Äì which
allow clipboard sharing/shared folders/other interoperative network
functions ‚Äì are not compatible with DOS or any Windows editions before
4.0. There are workarounds, but I haven‚Äôt found any reasonably within my
current abilities.

Truthfully, though, emulating twenty-year-old software seems a bit
unnecessary when contrasted with the fact that Markdown, Typora, and
Writeas were https://write.as/community/chat-with-david-blue[supposed to
be my saviors] from distracted writing. A compulsion to comment on a
https://www.theinformation.com/articles/tech-execs-are-obsessing-over-note-taking-apps-we-tested-them-out[recent

that I _still_ haven‚Äôt written an in-depth review of Typora, which I
plan to prioritize in the near future, especially since it may finally
be officially releasing, according to

Another result of my reintroduction to academia is that I can now afford
a subscription to Adobe Creative Cloud thanks to student discounts. This
has been life-changing in a manner which I should probably be a bit
ashamed of, but once the desire to _make full use_ of my subscription
(by trying every single program it licenses) subsides, I really do
intend to become proficient with
https://www.davidblue.wtf/t/Adobe-Indesign/[InDesign] ‚Äì a learning
experience which I will surely at least attempt to thoroughly document,
here.

[[section0098.xhtml#digital-gardening]]
=== Digital Gardening

I think it was https://tomcritchlow.com/blogchains/digital-gardens/[Tom
Critchlow‚Äôs Digital Gardening blogchain] that first exposed me to the
term and https://tomcritchlow.com/wiki/[his static site-generated wiki
project] that introduced me to the concept of personal wikis, not so
long ago, though the desire to organize and/or archive
personally-relevant information through the format has actually been
rattling around my head for the better part of a decade. When I
discovered that one could install
https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/MediaWiki[MediaWiki] ‚Äì the platform
Wikipedia, itself is built on ‚Äì I created the shortlived _Drywall Wiki_,
once upon a time. Since I last wrote you, I also purchased the
https://extratone.wiki/[extratone.wiki] domain and played around once
again with the platform. Typora even offers exports in MediaWiki‚Äôs
bizarre proprietary text format! For better or worse, though, I don‚Äôt
see anything becoming of the project for the moment I suppose it feels
like somewhat of a risk, investing a lot of time I probably shouldn‚Äôt
have into documenting all of my Twitter jokes. For the moment, I think
my Notion account will have to serve as my personal wiki.

The most inciteful argument I‚Äôve read among the Digital Gardens
discourse revolves around _value_ as it is created within our personal
online writing spaces. Two of the many infinitely-quotable essays within
this space: Mike Caulfield‚Äôs
‚Äúhttps://hapgood.us/2015/10/17/the-garden-and-the-stream-a-technopastoral/[The
Garden and the Stream: A Technopastoral]‚Äù and
‚Äúhttp://snarkmarket.com/2010/4890[Stock and flow]‚Äù from _Snarkmarket_.
The former references Vannevar Bush‚Äôs infamous
‚Äúhttps://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1945/07/as-we-may-think/303881/[As
We May Think]‚Äù essay (which I‚Äôve finally gotten around to finishing and
its description of a ‚Äúmemex,‚Äù which many cite as a disturbingly-apt
prediction of the World Wide Web. Caulfield, however, disagrees:

____
So most people say this is the original vision of the web. And certainly
it was the inspiration of those pioneers of hypertext. But in reality it
doesn‚Äôt predict the web at all . Not at all. The web works very little
like this. It‚Äôs weird, because in our minds the web still works like
this, but it‚Äôs a fiction.
____

Reading back from a lens including this commentary, I immediately
understood. The _memex_ concept is far more intimate than the web has
become (or perhaps ever was ‚Äì I wouldn‚Äôt know.) ‚ÄúStock and flow‚Äù defines
creative value in two disparate types of media:

____
*Flow* is the feed. It‚Äôs the posts and the tweets. It‚Äôs the stream of
daily and sub-daily updates that reminds people you exist.

*Stock* is the durable stuff. It‚Äôs the content you produce that‚Äôs as
interesting in two months (or two years) as it is today. It‚Äôs what
people discover via search. It‚Äôs what spreads slowly but surely,
building fans over time.
____

To be honest, I personally cannot imagine undertaking the task of
explaining this differentiation to _anyone_ in my own life, but if the
reactionary movement within The Web back to a focus on _valuable_
content is, indeed, underway, perhaps such conversations are bound to
shortly become more and more natural. For my part, I have attempted
setting up an experimental site on Github Pages using Jekyll in the past
few days with partial success: as soon as I tried to specify a custom
theme, I apparently broke it, at which point I realized that I had
homework to do. As much as I hate to admit it,
https://kevq.uk/static-site-generators-revisited/[Kev Quirk‚Äôs posts
regarding WordPress‚Äô _practical_ simplicity over SSGs] earlier this
monthrings somewhat true. As things currently stand, WordPress‚Äô
permeability throughout The Web is an _advantage_ for those who just
want to publish something as simply as possible. My counterargument to
both Kev and myself: *https://write.as/[Writeas] is a wonderful
compromise* in terms of substance and _image_ among one‚Äôs super
e-enabled, Mullenweg-disgusted peers. It‚Äôs very much pure Markdown, but
it‚Äôs far more accessible, cross-platform, than SSGs due to its shear
simplicity.

One component which Digital Gardening would seem to offer others that I
have never particularly struggled with is the freedom to write whatever
I feel like writing. If anything, I have struggled in the opposite
sense, existing in a state _completely unhindered_ by consideration of
the value my work may or may not offer anyone else. Perhaps the most
substantial addition I‚Äôm capable of making to the Digital Gardens
conversation, then, is best quoted from the first chapter of the advice
book I have finally begun writing for young men,
_https://www.davidblue.wtf/writing/projects/piss/[For God‚Äôs Sake, Just
Sit Down to Piss]_:

____
If there is one idea of mine you ever engage with ‚Äì in this book or
otherwise ‚Äì it is best distilled in this single sentence: *you do not
*actually* want to attain a state of true apathy*, trust me. It is
extremely unhealthy, miserable, and alienating. I have existed for an
excruciatingly long time trapped in a state of being truly unable to
care about anything in the face of a great, varying effort to do so. It
is very far from the immunity imbued in terms like _carefree_ ‚Äì in
reality, it is manifested in extreme depression. It is less _immunity_
than it is _distance_ from an essential part of life.
____

In terms of one‚Äôs blogging, I am glad for those who will/have/are
finding a new freedom of expression, but hold this as a serious caution
regarding the _other_ extreme. Should you ever approach it, remember
that _considering one‚Äôs audience_ ‚Äì as academics love to prioritize ‚Äì
really _is_ important, eventually.

[[section0098.xhtml#curation]]
=== Curation

At this point, I‚Äôve used https://bit.ly/extratone[a channel in
_Extratone_‚Äôs Discord] as my ongoing reading list for several years
essentially without change. Earlier this month, though, I discovered
Raindrop ‚Äì a bookmarking service with public collections that (so fars)
feels much more aligned with my own needs than Pocket ‚Äì and pretty much
immediately signed up to begin paying for it and set up a bot to
crosspost from https://raindrop.io/collection/13380406[my new Reading
List collection], there to the same Discord channel via
https://raindrop.io/collection/13380406/feed[the collection‚Äôs RSS feed].
Raindrop‚Äôs browser extension ‚Äì along with Notion‚Äôs, come to mention it ‚Äì
is _actually usable_ in day-to-day browsing. As much as I love
https://www.reading.am/davidblue[Reading.am], the prospect of its
longevity worries me considering the most recent post in its
https://writing.reading.am/[development blog] dates to 2016. Writing a
dedicated ‚Äúhttps://www.davidblue.wtf/c/software/little/[Little Review]‚Äù
of Raindrop is on my (ever-lengthening) todo list, but at the moment, I
would especially emphasize my
https://raindrop.io/collection/13419360[Digital Magazine Collection],
which is the result of thousands of hours of web exploration and
genuinely worth significant value for most anyone, I think.

With the combination of my public Notion workspaces and public Raindrop
collections, I hope to make my curatorial endeavors both more accessibly
beautiful and more intimately available. In terms of a dedicated
discussion of Notion‚Äôs interworkings and culture, I think I have quite a
bit more exploring to experience before I‚Äôm sufficiently qualified,
though my notes are already quite extensive (and
https://www.notion.so/rotund/Little-Review-Notes-228e10a1d3fe453fac69c9244a24ee3a[publicly
accessible], thanks to‚Ä¶ Notion!) In general, I continue to be astounded
by the amount of tools/services/applications I _have not yet_ heard of,
despite how long I have labored to become an authority on Writing Tools.

[[section0098.xhtml#workflow]]
=== Workflow

In my endeavor to more intentionally design my workspace ‚Äì to actually
dedicate a space for working, originally ‚Äì I originally very much
intended to set up dual displays for my desktop, but the desk I settled
for (an old family piece from the early 1900s?) does _not_ have enough
surface area to position two displays, regardless of how thin they‚Äôve
become since I last had one. Combined with a limited budget and a
concern that two displays might actually result in _further_ distraction
instead of less, I instead went for a single, 27‚Äù LED affair. I‚Äôve also
been making full use of
https://www.cnet.com/how-to/how-to-use-multiple-desktops-in-windows-10/[Windows
10‚Äôs desktop switching feature] and have found it surprisingly easy to
make a habit, especially thanks to the *Ctrl+Win+Lateral Arrow Keys*
keyboard shortcuts.

image:xhtml/https:/i.snap.as/lEx7zen.png[Hildur Keyboard Shortcuts]

On the subject of keyboard shortcuts, I‚Äôve by now worked out a
personally-optimized remap (thanks to the keyboard manager tool included
with https://github.com/microsoft/PowerToys[PowerToys], about which I
have _far too much_ to say in some future post.) I had
https://mastodon.social/web/statuses/104843391967830863[a conversation
with a few Mastodon friends] two weeks ago convincing me that my
methodology of forcing myself to learn shortcuts by integrating a cheat
sheet into my desktop backgrounds may actually be an _original idea_ and
useful to other users.

In terms of writing spaces, I have actually been composing the less
serious stuff I‚Äôve been writing within WordPress‚Äô Gutenberg editor,
which is _not_ an admission I would‚Äôve expected to be making, just a
year ago. A dedicated post about this, too, is _fucking coming_, but
suffice it to say that with a fairly-substantial PC and a better hosting
provider (DreamHost over GoDaddy, in this case,) composition has become
_far far_ smoother ‚Äì improving enough to make it a viable space within
which to pound away original stuff for the first time. Writing essays
for academia has encouraged my return to Microsoft Word, once again, on
which I‚Äôll blame the fact that I am currently composing this very bit in
The Old Bitch. A desire to once again hack together a set of
personalized Word templates has led to the birth of two such files which
I am proud enough to
https://www.notion.so/rotund/Configuration-2efccc31e19540c294b2bc5b7cfa4863[share
on my Notion drive]. Eventually, I would also like to take the time to
completely redesign the ‚ÄúRibbon‚Äù in Word ‚Äì something which I‚Äôve
literally never seen anyone else do. (I spent a substantial amount of
time trying to find a library for MS Office customization files, to no
avail, though you can find my own customization file as it stands on the
same Notion page linked just now. Let me know if you‚Äôre able to
successfully import it.)

A confession of vanity: I suspect the only reason I haven‚Äôt yet stopped
composing within WordPress is that I figured out how to change the
typeface to Adobe Caslon (across both the editor and the front-facing
site, naturally,) thanks to my newfound access to Adobe Typekit. Yes,
apparently I really _am_ that shallow. For those Office 365 users among
you, I _highly_ suggest you look up
https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/turn-off-annoying-sounds-microsoft-office-2016/[how

them both adorable and genuinely useful as auditory feedback. You may

=== The Read-It Website

If you know me at all, the following admission probably seems
unbelievable: I have been _using Reddit_. I created a
https://www.reddit.com/r/extratown/[new subreddit for _Extratone_] ‚Äì
which I do not necessarily expect to be populated any time soon ‚Äì and
https://www.reddit.com/r/softwarehistory[r/SoftwareHistory] after
discovering that it didn‚Äôt yet exist, which I _definitely_ do not expect
you to populate, but would be delighted if you did. As with seemingly
everything else I‚Äôve covered, I _also_ intend to write about how
Reddit‚Äôs recent feature additions and redesign may _actually_ make it a
redeemable space on The Web, which should prove interesting. Clearly, I
have become more than willing to accept the moniker of _Software
Historian_ whenever/if ever my authority achieves the appropriate volume
to deserve to be christened so.

Obviously, none of the developments I‚Äôve shared in this post indicate
any improvement in my productive output, but I hope to learn soon how to
settle into a fairly-consistent (and hopefully much more original)
writing process.

[[section0099.xhtml#the-pop-culture-discussion-of-tech-s-greater-issues-missed-in-at-least-two-major-ways]]
=== The pop culture discussion of tech's greater issues missed in (at least) two major ways.

_Listen to this article read by Siri Voice 2 below..._

For those of us who've written about technology, generally, for quite a
long time, any injection of the broader metaphysical/‚Äúethical‚Äù
conversation regarding the impact the industry has had/is having/is
expected to have on our species into popular culture is inevitably an
emotional event. _The Social Network_ had an almost comical disregard
for any potential function as a substantial critique of its subjects.
Not that it's particularly supportive of that argument, but Mark Fuck,
himself, recently
https://www.businessinsider.com/mark-zuckerberg-mentions-the-social-network-during-testimony-2018-4[said
in court], essentially, that he didn't know what the movie was about.
I'm not particularly sure, either. I suppose the dramatic film industry
has no particular obligation to be critical of _the times_, but
_documentaries_ certainly should, in my estimation, and _The Social
Dilemma_ could've done better, in that regard.

First, the *actively misleading*: As thoroughly as I enjoyed Peter
Campbell's casting as the master-manipulating triplets behind the
dramatized young man's screen, the film's depiction of this very human
invasion of privacy is _blatantly false_ imagery. The Privacy Problem is
_not_ that Facebook or Google employees are directly and actively
viewing and manipulating your use of their services in real time. In
fact, it is _ridiculously_ unlikely that human eyes will ever see your
individualized information. One could go so far as to describe the whole
film as ‚Äúridiculous,‚Äù as did one of my favs,
https://www.theverge.com/interface/2020/9/16/21437942/social-dilemma-netflix-review-orlowski-sarah-zhang-memo-facebook-buzzfeed[Casey
Newton]:

____
The dramatized segments include a fictional trio of sociopaths working
inside an unnamed social network to design bespoke push notifications to
distract their users. They show an anguished family struggling to get
the children to put their phones away during dinner. And the ominous
piano score that pervades every scene, rather than ratcheting up the
tension, gives it all the feeling of camp.
____

https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/4/21419993/the-social-dilemma-jeff-orlowski-netflix-movie-review-social-media-algorithms[_The
Verge_'s official review of the film] ‚Äì written by Adi Robinson and as
cited by Casey ‚Äì is an important read, as well. Robinson makes use of
some very intelligent language and cites some very interesting bits
(including a Wikipedia article about a series of Hogarth paintings?) for
_The Verge_'s audience, who already knew all of this. What I hoped to do
by writing about this at all was speak to those distinctly _separate_
tech media ‚Äì grandmothers, retirees, etc. ‚Äì who are both directly
affected by the subjects covered by _The Social Dilemma_ and
particularly susceptible to its delusions about ‚Äúprivacy‚Äù ‚Äì a term which
I would argue is not particularly relevant to the conversation.
Personally, I define my privacy in a way that is not violated by the
simple *collection* of ‚Äúmy data,‚Äù regardless of how detailed said
collection may or may not be, but would be by individual *examination*
with human eyes, which ‚Äì while possible ‚Äì is extremely unlikely if for
no other reason than a lack of business incentive. While Google may have
access to the data it would need to determine whether I am currently
showering or not, there is absolutely zero monetary gain to be had in
one of its employees (or outsourced contractors) knowing this.

____
you don't have to care about reforming privacy, intellectual property,
or any of the other issues an alternative addresses ‚Äì you need only to
want a better and/or different experience.

Now, on to the *notably missing*: Perhaps most important to note before
I go on is that the film was produced by ‚Äì and directly promotes on
several occasions ‚Äì one particular organization, called the
https://www.humanetech.com/[_Center for Humane Technology_], which
notably has a .com rather than a .org domain... hm. Immediately after
watching the film, I complied with its direction to its website, where I
was specifically looking for ‚Äúsolutions‚Äù to the issues it presented.
Aside from Wikipedia (sortof,) it neglected to mention the abundance of
alternative organizations and projects who've been building against the
adtech-funded web for ages ‚Äì some for decades. Unfortunately, neither
the organization's website nor the film's webpage list any of these
alternatives, whatsoever, which personally leads me to believe *the
whole thing is bullshit*, for lack of a better term.

image:xhtml/https:/i.snap.as/6k9MzeE.png[The Social Dilemma Newsletter
Prompt]

The film essentially argues for a single choice: using social media and
other adtech-sustained services, or _not_ using them. What I'm here to
tell you: *you have a choice of services*. For every single individual
service criticized in the film, I guarantee there exists at least a
handful of alternatives across a spectrum of sin. If you've followed my
work for any length of time (you probably shouldn't still be reading,)
you know I've advocated exhaustively for
https://joinmastodon.org/[Mastodon] ‚Äì the open web, decentralized social
network outpacing Twitter in every single way. Two years ago, I spent
https://bilge.world/bandcamp-streaming-music[an entire summer] arguing
that Bandcamp is the only music streaming service who's business model
benefits both platform and artist. I'm still finishing up
https://www.notion.so/rotund/David-Blue-vs-Big-Blue-9d82a679c93a41d78c6736e8a61e30e0[a
massive essay that discusses alternatives to Facebook], which has been
an exhausting but educational journey, as you can probably imagine,
namely that leaving a platform as all-consuming as Facebook for an
open-source and/or federated alternative requires a certain amount of
bravery. Essentially, the evidence suggests that the _alternatives_
discussion is a particularly important one to me, as is finding a way to
evangelize it that isn't immediately off-putting to ‚Äúthe average
person.‚Äù

Poke around the film's official website a bit and you'll discover a
variety of heavily-branded ‚Äúresources‚Äù for ‚Äútaking action,‚Äù all awash
with a certain irony, including
https://drive.google.com/file/d/1juAZCcmRpNNjXajXnm0KOS-9fFUhPI3q/view[a
fucking Bingo game] (hosted on Google Drive, no less,) which the site
_actually_ suggests you post on your Instagram story! Also under the
‚ÄúTake Action‚Äù vertical are links to Moment CEO Tim Kendall's
https://www.thesocialdilemma.com/reclaim-your-screen-time/[tips for
reducing your screen time], the ‚Äúhttps://datadetoxkit.org/en/home/[Data
Detox Kit],‚Äù which advocates for Firefox as the private browsing
solution (among an indigestibly huge link tree,) a ‚ÄúJoin Now‚Äù button,
and ‚Äì most ironic of all ‚Äì a link to download the
‚Äúhttps://adobserver.org/[Ad Observer plugin],‚Äù in order to ‚Äúshare with
researchers the ads you see on social media as they work to expose
micro-targeting techniques & hold political advertisers accountable.‚Äù In
other words, the very same data collection the film condemns, albeit for
the ‚ÄúOnline Political Transparency Project‚Äù instead of the greater
adtech monstrosity.

image:xhtml/https:/i.snap.as/gf22b9R.png[The Social Dilemma Bingo]

No, it's not a scam. Using _The Markup_'s shiny new
https://themarkup.org/blacklight[Blacklight tool], I found
thesocialdilemma.com to be entirely free of any malicious tracking aside
from the inevitable accompaniment to their Google Drive embeds. (Here's
https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/893e4684-462b-4548-92ad-b85f240d0e85/report.html?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=AKIAT73L2G45O3KS52Y5%2F20201001%2Fus-west-2%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20201001T204417Z&X-Amz-Expires=86400&X-Amz-Signature=98001ad78557d11b12dda1347cb193c252f54a81b00547970717080c06bf04eb&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&response-content-disposition=filename+%3D%22report.html%22[the
report in full].) All at once, we can be virtually certain there is no
_malice_ in this particular destination, at least, which leaves...
incompetence? I'm afraid so. It is not revolutionary to suppose that the
people who conceived of these ruthlessly effective systems of adtech and
figure out how to implement them in the real world ‚Äì regardless of what
they believe now, or then ‚Äì that these folks should not be our first
call when we're searching for ‚Äúsolutions.‚Äù You know this, they know it,
and they _explicitly acknowledged it_ at least twice in the film,
itself, and yet the fact of it remains.

Would you care to guess what
https://datadetoxkit.org/en/privacy/essentials/#step-1[Chapter 1] of the
https://datadetoxkit.org/[_Digital Detox Kit_] is about? I can't imagine
you'd be correct... Under the heading ‚ÄúCONTROL YOUR SMARTPHONE DATA,‚Äù
step 1 is literally just _renaming your phone_:

____
At some point, you may have ‚Äúnamed‚Äù your phone for _Wi-Fi, Bluetooth_ or
both ‚Äì or maybe the name was automatically generated during setup.

This means that _‚ÄúAlex Chung‚Äôs Phone‚Äù_ is what‚Äôs visible to the Wi-Fi
network owner and, if your Bluetooth is turned on, to everyone in the
area who has their Bluetooth on as well.

You wouldn't announce your name as you enter a caf√©, restaurant, or
airport, so neither should your phone.
____

Now, I've always considered the ability to change a computer's name an
immense privilege. My first ‚Äúreal‚Äù computer's name was Clementine, then
there was Bertha, two Sophies (probably my favorite traditionally female
name, so I excuse myself,) Silas, Linus, Uel, Jehoshaphat, Temba, Knot,
and now Hildur. My iPhone 8 Plus' name is Gravel. However, I realize
that most users could care less, and I think that's completely rational.
Technically, suggesting you change your phone's common name to that of
‚Äúyour favorite television character‚Äù
(https://fortitude.fandom.com/wiki/Hildur_Odegard[Hildur Odegard] is my
favorite character in _Fortitude_, so...) is _not_ bad advice, even
within its own privacy-centered argument, it's just that it's
_ridiculously_ low priority (or should be) compared with doing just
about anything else along this vein. A conundrum is presented: I cannot
imagine these people sitting down and seriously jotting down ‚Äúchange
device name‚Äù as step 1 in their strategy, but I also cannot fathom an
incentive for them to expend such effort facetiously or maliciously.
Again, incompetence/ignorance is the only remaining explanation.

image:xhtml/https:/i.snap.as/sEa9ojU.jpeg[Firefox for iOS Notification]
_A notification I received while literally typing this out._

I have to backtrack, now, and confess that I _did_ find an
‚Äúhttps://datadetoxkit.org/en/alternative-app-centre/[Alternative Apps
Centre]‚Äù within the Data Detox Kit, which contains some genuinely smart
recommendations like ProtonMail, Riot, Signal, and DuckDuckGo
surrounding a bunch of privacy-enhancing browser extensions. However,
the ‚Äúdetox‚Äù seems to have been lost at some point along the way. No
amount of privacy (yes, I do think it's hilarious that I can freely
refer to ‚Äúprivacy‚Äù as a commodity with a positive quantity) can detoxify
one' social media addiction. The savvy reader notes the ‚ÄúSupported by
Mozilla Firefox‚Äù badges all over the website and asks me ‚Äúwell, what did
you expect?‚Äù My answer: something ‚Äúmore‚Äù than promotion, I suppose.

I suspect this is another case of _don't go to those who created the
problem for the solution_. _More privacy_ is a more tangible vector upon
which to ‚Äúinnovate‚Äù than simply _putting down the fucking phone_, but
the interviewees in the film at least touched upon a very important
insight in that regard: *turn off all your notifications*. I genuinely
believe turning off _all_ notifications is a good way to proceed,
especially if this film (or anything else, for that matter) has made you
feel uncomfortable about your relationship with your phone. I realized
that I'd somehow allowed YouTube to clutter my notifications
unconsciously for _years_, which is disturbing. In general, the apps
who's notifications I'd probably value the most (Bandcamp!) are the ones
who use the feature the least/the most subtly.

Leaving your phone in a different room while you sleep is a good idea,
though it seems a bit excessive when you could just *turn it off*,
instead. (Displaced from your bed or stone dead, your chances of making
use of your handset in an emergency are about the same, I'd wager.) I
suspect it's long overdue for a reboot, anyway. As far as ‚Äú*Email
Addiction*‚Äù goes, I suggest you first take an afternoon to go through
your inbox and make use of GDPR's greatest gift: the single-click
opt-out, most often found in very small text in a given email's footer.
If you're _really_ serious, unsubscribe from even the newsletters you
_do_ read and make yourself resubscribe to them. Make use of your
preferred email platform's archives feature ‚Äì or don't ‚Äì but clear
everything from your inbox itself. Mark it all as read. Then, you'll be
ready to seek out other _Email Wellness_ methodologies like the
recently-trendy _Inbox Zero_.

If quitting social media cold turkey is not viable in your personal or
professional life, *a set daily time* to check your notifications is a
very good start. Yes, it's okay to announce on Facebook that you're
taking a break from Facebook. There _is_ a very good reason:
accountability, to both yourself and your friends. If you are interested
in the alternatives I mentioned before, genuinely *contact me literally
any time*. My personal phone number is *(573) 823-4380*. I would be
elated to discuss some of the services I've discovered with you.

My own advice on ‚Äúprivacy:‚Äù don't worry about installing browser
extensions, or using a different browser for that matter. Aside from a
password manager, there is no need to download or install any additional
software to protect your information. All the ‚Äúprivacy tools‚Äù you need
are already present on your device, and they mostly consist of
geolocation settings. If you're an iOS user, you've already been
confronted with them in the past few months. If you are still genuinely
bothered by automated data collection unseen by human eyes, your only
next step ‚Äì if we're really honest with ourselves ‚Äì is figuring out how
you're going to go without the internet. Untracked browsing is no longer
a realistic option.

=== Purposing a disciplined effort to reflect on those tech products which have remained too fair and/or too good to catch the attention of the alarmists in us, recently.

I've never been a big fan of holidays, nor do I think Thanksgiving
should be a federal one, given its shitty, undebatably imperialist
origins, but these opinions are entirely inconsequential. Regardless of
how I feel, Thanksgiving will remain as pervasive as ever in the spaces
around me, so I thought I'd change things up this year and _actually
participate_ in a substantial way. I did my best to travel back to a
vastly less complicated self, letting all of the crud that's accumulated
atop my love of computers in the past twenty years: wokeness, adtech,
Obama wearing VR glasses, etc... When I thought the Native Americans
were _glad_ to see white people because they gave them guns and horses
and assumed people made things because good ideas were the apex of
currency. When I was able to respond to new software discoveries by
screwing around aimlessly without wondering if they'd been stolen
entirely from a handful of talented developers lacking in the resources
and know how required to protect their ideas in the face of Microsoft's
ruthless _Embrace, Extend, Extinguish_ crusade.

Forgive yourself for a moment and return there with me. Or perhaps
somewhere else, if you need ‚Äì wherever and whenever you last remember
feeling genuinely enthralled with _The Future of Computers_. (Perhaps it
was yesterday! If so, Gourd bless you. Never change.) Let's take
ourselves back to kindergarten, before we knew anything about the rapid
cyclical consolidation and monopolization within the technology industry
that had already established itself as a trend, by then, when all we
knew of the software we interacted with was contained within our most
visceral reactions: _I like Ask Jeeves because I like red and I like
Jeeves._ I vaguely remember when Google (the search engine) first
broached the general awareness of my elementary school's computer lab.
I'm fairly sure I even remember the sort of feelings that were elicited
the first time I actually set eyes on the Google.com homepage: it looked
so modern, then, compared to the rest of the web. (After two decades, it
currently looks like shit.) Upon the first first query, it was
immediately clear that Google was superior to any of the other search
engines we'd been using.

This sort of encounter ‚Äì with a service that significantly alters one's
perception of a given set of tasks ‚Äì is precious in our lives as users.

A few examples from my own using life which come to mind:

* The first time I witnessed a Skype call.
* Downloading and using the beta Evernote client on the school machines
in Junior High.
* The first album I uploaded on Bandcamp.
* Discord's first public release.
* The ‚Äúmoment‚Äù I first put a name to Markdown. (I'd been using bits of
the syntax for years before I actually read the word.)
* And most recently, exploring Notion as personal catch-all
documentation software.

The atmosphere of elation about the future on which I so often lament
has been replaced by wariness for most of us ‚Äì from Californian software
developers to tractor-hacking farmers. Now, the conversation is
saturated with CEO appearances before legal committees, corporate memo
leaks, and somber interviews. Of course, I have unquestionably
contributed _more_ than my share. In fact, I wish I could be twice as
critical in twice the written volume, and
https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/1329078973691695117[I believe] the
tech media industry to be far too culturally-embedded within Silicon
Valley to be nearly critical enough. For this holiday, though, I think a
respite from the negative is worthwhile and essential. I know it is for
_my_ personal sanity, at least.

theological software without participants such as the human who
submitted this one (thank you, human!,) and end up missing out on an
entire segment of software development. Having studied The Good Book in
a very much analog fashion through Lutheran school, I wonder in
retrospect how software solutions could've changed the experience.

I have never received this volume of feedback in my prompts before, nor

would compare to GIMP, necessarily. This shouldn't be breaking news: as
far as I know, there are billions of posts comparing the two going back
to
https://www.wired.com/1998/03/a-thrifty-photoshop-built-for-the-web/[the

accomplish much more, much faster with GIMP* in every single one of my
own use cases.

I was browsing some FOSS-related article aggregation page a few weeks
ago when a post caught my eye:
‚Äúhttps://blog.fosshub.com/audacity-exceeds-100-million-downloads/[Audacity
exceeds 100 million downloads].‚Äù In reflection, I realized in that
moment that perhaps no other single piece of software has been so
thoroughly present in my ‚Äúworkflows‚Äù across all sorts of projects
through the years, largely because of its God-sent
https://manual.audacityteam.org/man/truncate_silence.html[Truncate
Silence feature], which I have used to remove silence from audio files
for as long as I've been working within the medium, basically. Every
podcast episode I have ever published has passed through Audacity for
this reason and others, as have voiceovers, high school punk band demo
tapes, personal voice notes, and more.

____
the world would actually be perfect if audacity's truncate silence
feature could be autotied to video timecodes.

Until OBS came along, Audacity was where all recorded audio started for
myself and my creative friends. It was Audacity that captured (and
caused, technically) the https://clyp.it/ycvt1wij[death of my friend's
soundcard in audio form] during the recording process for
https://ihadtopee.bandcamp.com/album/hamura[_Hamura_], the first Drywall
album, back in October of 2011.

Fucking around in Audacity through the years has led to some halfway
creative results on my part, including
https://soundcloud.com/digivoid/hilary-duff-with-love-slowed-n-throwed[‚ÄúSLOWED

https://soundcloud.com/chordoslut/windows-operatic[legacy Windows sounds
remixes]. I still use it for every episode of
https://anchor.fm/davidblue[_End User_] and have recently created a
macro for remastering https://anchor.fm/drycast[_Drycast_] episodes. (A
big feat for me and reflective of Audacity's ingenuity.) As far as I
know, there are _zero_ competitors, proprietary or not, which can
replicate Audacity's particular usefulness as an audio utility.

Shortly after I discovered NeoCities last Spring, I signed up to be a

immediately sounded like one I was personally obligated to uplift.
Parimal Satyal's essay

[[section0101.xhtml#reclaiming-tastemaking-for-listeners-in-the-spotify-era]]
=== Reclaiming tastemaking for listeners in the Spotify era.

Last week, Spotify users were treated to the service‚Äôs annual
‚Äúhttps://newsroom.spotify.com/2020-12-01/6-new-features-to-unwrap-in-your-spotify-2020-wrapped/[Spotify
Wrapped]‚Äù feature: a visual summary of an account‚Äôs listening habits
throughout the year, including their most listened-to artists. New for
2020 are ‚Äúin-app quizzes,‚Äù a chronological ‚ÄúStory of Your 2020,‚Äù and
detailed podcast listening statistics. For premium users, ‚Äúbadges‚Äù will
‚Äúcrown listeners with various titles based on the ways they listened.‚Äù

____
For example, if a number of your playlists gained significant new
followers, you‚Äôll be a _Tastemaker._ If you listened to a song before it
was cool (aka hit 50,000 streams), you‚Äôll get the _Pioneer_ badge. And
based on the number of songs you added to playlists this year, you just
might become a _Collector_.
____

Their use of the term _Tastemaker_ is particularly interesting.
‚ÄúTastemaking‚Äù ‚Äì a function once relegated to magazines ‚Äì has taken a
concerning bent in the Algorithmic Age. Very much contemporary terms
like ‚Äúhttps://megaphone.link/VMP4291212808[filter bubble]‚Äù and
‚Äúhttps://www.culturedmag.com/shouts-echo-chamber/[echo chamber]‚Äù ‚Äì
applied more and more often to social platforms like Facebook and
Twitter, now ‚Äì can also be associated with music streaming services like
Spotify, who‚Äôs ‚Äúplaylistification‚Äù of content has had a number of
alarming effects on American culture.

image:xhtml/https:/i.snap.as/jKs57Tfw.png[Premium Badges - Spotify]

In 2018, _The Baffler_‚Äôs Liz Pelly explored Spotify playlists‚Äô gender
bias in ‚Äúhttps://thebaffler.com/latest/discover-weakly-pelly[Discover
Weekly]:‚Äù

____
On Today‚Äôs Top Hits, I found that over the course of one month, 64.5
percent of the tracks were by men as the lead artist, with 20 percent by
women and 15.5 percent relying on collaborations between men and women
artists. When all features were taken into consideration, I found that
85.5 percent of tracks included men artists, while only 45.5 percent
included women. This was one of the highest percentages of women artists
out of all the playlists I examined.
____

She also quotes a LinkedIn post by ‚ÄúJerry Daykin, the Head of Media
Partnerships at Diageo,‚Äù in which he observes, ‚ÄúThe most popular tracks
on Spotify get featured in more playlists and become even more popular
as a result.‚Äù In January of the same year, the online music magazine
_Pitchfork_ published an op-ed by musician Damon Krukowski entitled
‚Äúhttps://pitchfork.com/features/oped/how-to-be-a-responsible-music-fan-in-the-age-of-streaming/[How
to Be a Responsible Music Fan in the Age of Streaming],‚Äù which provided
concrete statistics on this phenomenon (emphasis mine:)

____
According to the data trackers at
http://www.buzzanglemusic.com/[BuzzAngle Music], [on Spotify,] more than
*99 percent of audio streaming is of the top 10 percent most-streamed
tracks*. Which means *less than 1 percent of streams account for all
other music*.
____

‚ÄúWhile streaming media is pitched to us as tailored to our taste, or at
least to our browsing history,‚Äù Krukowski goes on to note, ‚Äúthe business
of it is in fact closer to one-size-fits-all.‚Äù Clearly, this is an
issue, but technically *only insofar as Spotify advertises itself as a
means to discover new music*, which
https://www.spotify.com/us/about-us/contact/[it does consistently].

The company has faced criticism in other areas, most recently by _The
New Yorker_‚Äôs Alex Ross in a widely-read review of
‚Äúhttps://mitpress.mit.edu/books/decomposed[Decomposed: The Political
Ecology of Music],‚Äù a new book by University of Oslo professor Kyle
Devine, entitled
‚Äúhttps://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/the-hidden-costs-of-streaming-music[The
Hidden Costs of Streaming Music].‚Äù Ross first cites a statement by
Spotify CEO Daniel Elk, ‚ÄúThe artists today that are making it realize
that it‚Äôs about creating a continuous engagement with their fans,‚Äù
arguing the true meaning of his words to be ‚Äúto make a living as a
musician, you need to claw desperately for attention at every waking
hour.‚Äù His most original (as in, yet to be considered in the mainstream
discourse) argument, though, involves the service‚Äôs environmental
impact. He cites Devine‚Äôs depiction of a profound cultural delusion
surrounding the consumption of music, suggesting that music is ‚Äúseen as
a special pursuit that somehow transcends the conditions of its
production.‚Äù

____
In a chapter on the digital and streaming era, Devine drives home the
point that there is no such thing as a nonmaterial way of listening to
music: ‚ÄúThe so-called cloud is a definitely material and mainly
hardwired network of fiber-optic cables, servers, routers, and the
like.‚Äù This concealment of industrial reality, behind a phantasmagoria
of virtuality, is a sleight of hand typical of Big Tech, with its genius
for persuading consumers never to wonder how transactions have become so
shimmeringly effortless.
____

Also noteworthy are questions of Spotify‚Äôs viability as a business,
which Ross includes by citing
https://www.barrons.com/articles/spotifys-losses-widen-as-subscribers-keep-growing-51596034688[a
July article in _Barrons_] quoting Spotify Technology‚Äôs second-quarter
earnings report: ‚ÄúThe streaming music company lost $418 million, or
$2.24 per share, versus analysts‚Äô expectations for a 41-cent loss.‚Äù
Spearheading this year‚Äôs news conversation surrounding the company,
though, were its widespread acquisitions in the Podcasting industry,
including
https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/6/18213462/spotify-podcasts-gimlet-anchor-acquisition[Anchor],
https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/10/21557458/spotify-megaphone-podcast-streaming-ad-insertion[Megaphone],
https://www.vox.com/2019/2/7/18214941/alex-blumberg-matt-lieber-gimlet-spotify-deal-acquisition-peter-kafka-media-podcast-audio-interview[Gimlet
Media], and ‚Äì
https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/25/opinion/joe-rogan-spotify-podcast.html[most
controversially] ‚Äì the exclusive rights to the most listened-to property
in the medium,
https://www.theverge.com/21265005/spotify-joe-rogan-experience-podcast-deal-apple-gimlet-media-ringer[_The
Joe Rogan Experience_]. Though details of their implications are beyond
the scope of this essay, it is reasonable to assume its concerns ‚Äì if
not its proposed solutions ‚Äì should apply to the future of podcasting as
well.

[[section0101.xhtml#responsible-curation]]
=== Responsible Curation

For solutions to address Spotify‚Äôs overwhelming skew toward rewarding
popular music with even more popularity, we can first look within its
own history to just a few years earlier, when human curation was more
equally matched in its fight against algorithmic curation. In 2015, the
company claimed that
‚Äúhttps://pitchfork.com/features/article/9686-up-next-how-playlists-are-curating-the-future-of-music/[Half
of Spotify users stream from other users‚Äô playlists at least monthly].‚Äù
_Pitchfork_‚Äôs Marc Hogan profiled a number of ‚Äúpower users‚Äù within the
upper percentile in terms of followers and personal playlist popularity.
Notably, all of his examples are male.

Generally, human curation should hypothetically combat its algorithmic
counterpart in terms of favoring already commercially successful
content, if not its gender disparity. The industry‚Äôs other biggest
player, Apple Music, has invested heavily and successfully in the
former. (Disclosure: I have been an Apple Music subscriber since its
launch.) _Fast Company_ addressed this contrast in a 2018 long read
entitled
‚Äúhttps://www.fastcompany.com/90205519/spotifys-playlist-for-global-domination[Spotify‚Äôs
$30 billion playlist for global domination]:‚Äù

____
Cook‚Äôs words embody Apple‚Äôs longstanding critique of Spotify, which is
that its algorithms are eroding music‚Äôs spiritual role in our lives.
Cook doesn‚Äôt mention Spotify by name but says, ‚ÄúWe worry about the
humanity being drained out of music, about it becoming a bits-and-bytes
kind of world instead of the art and craft.‚Äù
____

Then again, the same article also quotes Tim Cook ‚Äì the CEO of the most
valuable company in the history of the world ‚Äì as insisting ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not
in it for the money.‚Äù In turn, Daniel Elk is quoted, saying ‚ÄúMusic is
everything we do all day, all night, and that clarity is the difference
between the average and the really, really good,‚Äù though what exactly he
is quantifying as ‚Äúreally, really good‚Äù is not entirely clear. In
context, the words of both leaders seem untrustworthy ‚Äì vague, at best.

In tremendous and relevant contrast to the voices of these CEOs is that
of Ethan Diamond, CEO and co-founder of Bandcamp, a music streaming
service unlike any other. In https://mtflabs.net/podcast076/[an
interview with Music Tech Fest director Andrew Dubber this May], Diamond
exemplifies an entirely different mentality in running a for-profit
service for independent music artists.

In 2007, Diamond and former colleagues Shawn Grunberger, Joe Holt, and
Neal Tucker set out to build the equivalent of blogging services like
Blogger, WordPress, MovableType, etc. for musicians. As Holt bemoaned in
http://htmltimes.com/band-camp.php[a 2008 interview with _The HTML
Times_], creating an online presence for one‚Äôs music had long been ‚Äúa
pain in the ass:‚Äù[^1]

____
You need to find a place to host it, you‚Äôve gotta get the metadata
right, it‚Äôs just hard. So we just decided we would do that hard part for
musicians so that they didn‚Äôt have to be so nerdy.
____

From its very origin, the team designed Bandcamp to make the process of
publishing one‚Äôs music as easy as possible. In
https://blog.bandcamp.com/2008/09/16/hello-cleveland/[the first post on
the company‚Äôs blog from September, 2008], Diamond details the results of
their engineering:

____
We keep your music streaming and downloading quickly and reliably,
whether it‚Äôs 3am on a Sunday, or the hour your new record drops and
Pitchfork gives it a scathingly positive review. We make your tracks
available in every format under the sun, so the audiophilic nerderati
can have their FLAC and eat mp3 v2. We adorn your songs with all the
right metadata, so they sail into iTunes with artwork, album, band and
track names intact. We mutter the various incantations necessary to keep
your site top-ranked in Google, so when your fans search for your hits,
they find your music long before they find bonkersforlyrics.com or
iMyFace. We give your fans easy ways to share your music with their
friends, and we give you gorgeous tools that reveal exactly how your
music is spreading, so you can fan the fire.
____

In the years since, Bandcamp has demonstrated time and time again the
sincerity in its commitment to artists through programs like ‚ÄúBandcamp
Fridays,‚Äù when the service waives its cut of artists‚Äô revenue (ten
percent on physical releases, fifteen percent of digital.) In 2017, the
company
https://pitchfork.com/news/bandcamp-donating-proceeds-to-transgender-law-center-this-friday/[donated
a Friday‚Äôs share of proceeds to the Transgender Law Center] in response
to the Presidential Administration‚Äôs proposal to ban trans people from
serving in the U.S. military. This year, throughout the Coronavirus
pandemic, the company has repeatedly
https://daily.bandcamp.com/features/bandcamp-covid-19-fundraiser[brought
back the program] in recognition of its impact on independent artists,
and the results have been profound. On March 20th, for a specific
example, $4.3 million worth of purchases was distributed.

Unlike Spotify, Bandcamp _is_ a profitable company, and has been for
nearly a decade. In Dubber‚Äôs interview, Diamond explains their financial
origins:

____
In 2007/2008 we took a little bit of VC funding and then focused on
getting to profitability. So we did that and got there in 2012, and
that‚Äôs helped us maintain the mission, maintain the vision that we‚Äôve
had for the company for a long time.
____

Also in contrast to Spotify, Bandcamp explicitly invests in less
popular, fringe content, through its online publication the
https://daily.bandcamp.com[_Bandcamp Daily_]:

____
The mission of the Daily, it‚Äôs our editorial arm, and it‚Äôs just to
highlight this incredibly diverse world of music that‚Äôs on a site where
anybody can upload anything. And the result of that is that you have
weird subgenres and a lot of music, I think, that wouldn‚Äôt necessarily
be covered anywhere else.
____

Bandcamp has long demonstrated an anthesis to the business models
technology companies have been so criticized for upholding and has done
so in relative obscurity from the media. In his interview, Dubber asks
Diamond one of the primary questions prompting the creation of this
essay: ‚Äúhow come Bandcamp doesn‚Äôt get mentioned in all these press
articles about music services?‚Äù In answer, Diamond offers his own
business decisions out of ‚Äú[his] personal preference:‚Äù

____
I like the idea that Bandcamp hangs out in the background and just makes
all of this stuff work, and also, hopefully, helps the artist promote
themselves, and it‚Äôs not about ‚ÄúBandcamp, Bandcamp, Bandcamp.‚Äù[^2]
____

As a _Tastemaking_ enterprise, Bandcamp has combined magazine-style
editorial publishing with user-created content in the form of
Collections ‚Äì which allow listeners to display music they‚Äôve purchased
on a customizable web page ‚Äì and Artist Recommendations, which extend
from a creator‚Äôs Collection to those who follow them. This system has
demonstrably lead to community and cultural wellness by genre via
responsible commentary and selection from curating creators with
authority, while still profiting its parent company tremendously.
Bandcamp has grown from four to seventy employees in its 13-year
lifespan, https://bandcamp.com/about[while helping artists earn $634
million] as of December 2020. In the music industry, it is
unquestionably an outlier. Diamond inadvertently explains Bandcamp‚Äôs
success in response to a question from Dubber on the company‚Äôs
comparatively slow pace in terms of technological features (emphasis
mine:)

____
Deciding what to work on next, that has always felt like the easiest
part of the job because it‚Äôs whatever benefits artists the most. Because
*the way Bandcamp makes money is if artists make a lot more money*, so
that‚Äôs what we try to spend every day doing.
____

The solution to the ‚Äúdebacle‚Äù of streaming music, then, is not
necessarily charity or socioeconomic revolution. It would seem that all
it takes is a sincere investment in the real people who create music.

'''''

[1] While Bandcamp set out from the beginning to make it easier for
artists to publish music, getting music on Spotify has always been a
grueling process.

[2] I fully intended to quote Kaitlyn Tiffany on how organizations
_only_ get tech media attention if a significant amount of capital is
involved in some form, but I haven‚Äôt been able to find it. I‚Äôll
certainly come back and add it if/when I do.

These two sentences begin the sixth chapter of my indefinitely-postponed
novel, https://github.com/extratone/pith[_Blimp's Burden_], and are
almost certainly my best writing, ever. My vanity simply wouldn't allow
them to go forgotten, so I
https://bilge.world/blimps-burden-chapter-6[published the chapter as an
excerpt on _The Psalms_]. It may seem an intimidating wall of text, but
give it your attention and you'll be amused, I think.

[[section0102.xhtml#summer]]
=== Summer

The general, distinctly 21st-century wisdom regarding one's content
popularity seems to be something like _you never know what's going to
blow up_. I experienced this phenomena quite severely for the first time
in my writing life after posting
‚Äúhttps://bilge.world/google-page-experience[Google Is Not God of The
Web]‚Äù on https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23383548[HackerNews] right
before going out-of-touch for some 13 straight hours amidst a local BLM
protest. I did not intend to write a baity title, nor did I expect
anything to come of sharing it, there ‚Äì I only did so simply because the
thought crossed my mind. Honestly, it is probably the least-considered
content I'd ever published on _The Psalms_ ‚Äì I only put it up when I did
because I knew _all_ of my energy was about to be absorbed for an entire
weekend or more. I only started the thing because I felt it important to
raise a small voice in reminder that tech media had started using
language when discussing code/online development which had begun to
assume the existence of a single, objective standard of measure for
_good web design_. (Fuck your bootstrap baloney,
https://iowa.neocities.org/test[_The Drywall Website_] was a _real_
_paradigm shit_.)

And yet... That single goddamned post would end up accruing more
pageviews than all of my writing on the web, combined (I suspect.) Tens
of thousands of words were written in hundreds of comments, which I did
my best to parse in
https://davidblue.substack.com/p/witness-google-god-and-local-history[a
_for the hell of it_ substack email]:

____
Out of everything I‚Äôve shared on _Bilge_ recently, it‚Äôs hilarious that
this particular post ‚Äì on which I spent a cumulative total of perhaps 25
minutes writing and made less effort than ever to edit ‚Äì became probably
my most widely-shared work of all time.
____

Once again, I _am_ thankful for the readership and correspondence, I
just _really fucking wish_ it had been on literally _anything_ else I've
written about technology.

In retrospect, it really is bonkers that I was excited about yet another
vague promise to _re-imagine email_ in the days surrounding
https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/15/21286466/hey-email-basecamp-price-availability-platforms-launch[the
launch of Basecamp's HEY], but I feel it's important to nurture what
paltry genuine enthusiasm remains about technology and the future, so I
decided to respond to the service's homepage prompt, asking interested
visitors to write in with their own thoughts on email. I spent a morning
clacking out ‚Äúhttps://bilge.world/hey-email-history[Email and I: An
Abridged History],‚Äù which I hope will one day serve as a part-foundation
for a thorough, composed extension to my
https://gist.github.com/extratone/91ebe16b0c620f309e70b40f5d4dcd9e[_Why
I Write About Technology_] series. This would be _The Psalms_ last
relevant work for a few months, while I played around with
https://www.davidblue.wtf/wordpress-experimentation/[an experimental

first time in seven years.

[[section0102.xhtml#fall]]
=== Fall

I returned in late September with a partial recount of what I'd
discovered: ‚Äúhttps://bilge.world/digital-excess[Indulging Once More in
Digital Excess].‚Äù After exploring the concept of
https://tomcritchlow.com/blogchains/digital-gardens/[_Digital Gardens_],
buying https://www.davidblue.wtf/hp-envy-desktop/[my first pro-ready
desktop PC] in 10 years, playing with Big Boy Adobe software for the
first time, and reading
https://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674417076[a delightful
book] documenting the history of word processing, I arrived upon the
term _Software Historian_ with which to partially describe myself. It
doesn't mean all that much at the moment, but will no doubt be explored
imminently on this Web Site.

Addressing ‚Äúhttps://bilge.world/the-social-dilemma[The Social Dilemma's
Dilemma]‚Äù and ‚Äúhttps://bilge.world/big-thank[Software Thanksgiving]‚Äù in
detail would be awfully redundant, but I would at least note how they
represent diametrically opposed perspectives through which to discuss
this stuff. Going forward into 2021, I think it's important that I hold
short on the progress I've made in moderating my voice since 2018.
_Digestibility_ is not a virtue I am at all interested in, nor is it an
appropriate one in which to invest any more effort. Any non-_radical_
argument will inevitably prove enormously unoriginal, which makes for a
huge waste of all our time. For the moment, that's all the
editorializing I've done.

[[section0102.xhtml#three-point-oh]]
=== Three Point Oh

Somewhere along the research process for one of my school essays, I came
across the concept of academic
https://www.davidblue.wtf/git-peer-review/[revision tracking and peer
review via Git]. Having dipped my toe back in academia, any such
circumvention of its penchant for the most archaic practices possible
was naturally intriguing. _Just wait until I show these goons how to use
hyperlinks._ Perhaps inevitably, I was launched into the Git-Gone Bender
I'm still riding simply because I finally had ample reason to actually
understand it. In just two months, I've created and forked a total of
nearly 80 repositories on https://github.com/extratone[my new GitHub
account]. Though I'd created one for each of my web properties ages ago,
I had absolutely no idea how to actually make use of them, so they were
all quickly abandoned. In the past two weeks or so, I think I've
actually begun to get the hang of the system's core intricacies, best
exemplified by https://github.com/extratone/bilge[_The Psalms_'
Repository] as it stands.

The ‚Äúautomated‚Äù https://github.com/extratone/bilge/projects/1[Project
Board] I set up has so far been a very impressive replacement for the
simple todo list. It tracks and categorizes Post Ideas in their various
stages in my process: Mulling, Documentation (research,) Drafting, and
actual Publication. Technical
‚Äúhttps://github.com/extratone/bilge/issues[Issues]‚Äù regarding the CMS
and/or the Repository, itself, have also fit in these categories well,
so far. Just today, I discovered that one can simply tag Issues by their
number to describe
https://github.com/extratone/bilge/commits/main[Commits], which form an
impressive revision-tracking changelog when aggregated together. I also
figured out the general idea behind Milestones and set
https://github.com/extratone/bilge/milestone/1[_The Psalms_' first one]
for my 27th birthday, next month. The goal is to have figured this all
out well enough by then that I'm no longer randomly stumbling upon
entire featuresets multiple times in a workday.
https://tomcritchlow.com/2020/07/23/thinking-in-public/[_Thinking in
Public_] ‚Äì as my friend Tom Critchlow and his crowd say ‚Äì is what I'm
trying to do here, I think. Obviously, this really means that you are
more than welcome to hop the fuck in at any time, in any manner you'd
prefer. If Git is still no more than a conundrum for you ‚Äì as it was for
me just weeks ago ‚Äì I would suggest the directory for
https://github.com/extratone/bilge/tree/main/Drafts[In-Progress Drafts]
as a starting point.

https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/1336374708753797123

https://github.com/extratone/bilge/actions[GitHub Actions] are still
more or less a mystery to me, but I am unbothered ‚Äì _The Psalms_' seems
to be producing green text instead of red, now, in the midst of whatever
I set it up to do. I poked around the livestreams for ‚ÄúGitHub Universe‚Äù
a few weeks ago, when dark mode and GitHub Discussions were opened up to
more users. At the moment, I cannot imagine a single application for
forums in the context of my blog's repository, but
https://github.com/extratone/bilge/discussions[I turned them on,
anyway]. It's very possible that all of the documentation-generating
functions of Git are entirely unnecessary in this case, but ‚Äì as I
entrust GitHub with the eternal task of archiving such work ‚Äì it is my
hope that it will help me add further structure to my process.

discussing the current state of Adobe apps, I‚Äôve realized 1) I am quite
distinct from a _professional user_, which is why I genuinely find GIMP
more useful than Photoshop, for instance, and 2) given the length of my
to-write list considering my current pace, I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôd manage to
get around to it in this lifetime.

Between now and the 11th of this month, I will be migrating worthwhile
posts from the experimental WordPress site (WTF) here and closing its
hosting account. I haven‚Äôt been compelled to actually do anything with
it in months, and the handy redirects, alone, are not worth the upcosts,
however fair. Some content ‚Äì including the corresponding posts for my
Adobe experiments _will not_ be imported from WTF here. I‚Äôm also going
to rely on https://bit.ly/39VJ2y6[the Web Archive] for publishing the
rest. Notable discoveries so far include
‚Äúhttps://bilge.world/iphone4-photography[Through an iPhone 4‚Äôs Lens],‚Äù
which is a reminder of how revolutionary that particular handset was,
and a few extra-Psalms pieces of content I‚Äôd like you to experience,
like
https://www.notion.so/rotund/7f4664a737d1429eb94d33cb3486e9e0?v=aad96df288034d2dbe4dd667d6b7f543[this

he‚Äôs become quite the prolific https://twitch.tv/YourBudTevin[Twitch
streamer]. (I‚Äôve watched enough and know Tevin well enough to say that
he‚Äôs particularly entertaining in this medium.)

[[section0102.xhtml#coming-soon]]
=== Coming Soon

For better or worse, all of these new exploratory avenues have so far
led directly away from the business of _actually writing_, but ‚Äì in my
best self-estimation ‚Äì I suspect I‚Äôm mostly done with fiddling, now, and
ready to start thinking on the page, again. Predictably, I‚Äôve let my
upcoming https://github.com/extratone/bilge/issues/45[iPhone 12 Pro Max
Review] turn into quite a monstrosity over the past two months. It turns
out, years of lapsed attention toward iOS development resulted in my
feeling more out-of-the-loop than I expected, which I was compelled to
remedy, naturally. If you‚Äôre so inclined, you can follow the minutia
attached to my review process via
https://snap.as/extratone/iphone-12-pro-max[this dedicated Snapas
gallery], https://bit.ly/12bbbp[this shared iCloud album], my
http://bit.ly/psalmsyt[personal YouTube channel] , and
https://bit.ly/ip12pmtw[this Twitter collection].

https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/1344555610155712512

As per my newfound use of GitHub, I‚Äôve played around with various ways
of documenting this journey, specifically. First is
https://github.com/extratone/bilge/wiki/David-Blue-on-iPhone-&-iOS[this
Wiki page] (which I shall do my best to remember to keep updated)
listing the entirety of my writing history on iPhone and iOS. (It‚Äôs
uh... A bit underwhelming, if I‚Äôm honest.) I‚Äôve also just begun a
https://github.com/extratone/i[dedicated repository] for iOS-related
documentation and resources, which will soon include a full,
sensically-indexed list of iCloud share links to my entire Siri
Shortcuts collection (I hope.) Immediately following the review, I
intend to publish here a post
https://github.com/extratone/bilge/issues/56[dedicated to functions
Apple has failed to properly document], which I expect to be the most
widely-useful content on this domain. To see some of the suggestions
I‚Äôve received so far and/or to add your own, see
https://www.reddit.com/r/ios/comments/l5p7ly/underdocumented_ios_functions_stuff_you_wish[this
mildly-successful thread] I posted in r/iOS.

https://youtube.com/watch?v=uXIXjAWXVfQ

When I have finally tired of talking about handsets once more, I hope to
return my attention toward some other overwhelmingly-ambitious
monstrosities like my https://github.com/extratone/bigblue[academic
paper] proposing federated, open-source social networks in favor of the
Big Boys, my https://github.com/extratone/bilge/issues/44[report] on the
experience of returning to academia for a semester in 2020, and my
https://github.com/extratone/bilge/issues/12[evaluation of Notion] as
perhaps the next Big Step in the evolution of notetaking software.
Perhaps before tackling projects the size of these, I intend to compile
another https://github.com/extratone/bilge/issues/28[listicle of handy
tips] for newcomers to Writeas. As I linked before, you can now view the
entirety of _The Psalms‚Äô_ status in as much detail as you‚Äôd like via
https://github.com/extratone/bilge/projects/1[its Project Board on

http://twitter.com/neoyokel[Twitter],
https://mastodon.social/@DavidBlue[Mastodon],
http://bit.ly/holeguest[Discord], and/or via
mailto:davidblue@extratone.com[email]. Let‚Äôs hope 2021‚Äôs equivalent of
this review doesn‚Äôt take me until February to publish!

[[section0103.xhtml#in-the-bleak-face-of-twitter-s-centralization-tapbots-refuses-to-give-up-on-its-mobile-client]]
=== In the bleak face of Twitter‚Äôs centralization, Tapbots refuses to give up on its mobile client.

_Listen to this article read by Siri below..._

Were it just I who came to you with only my voice on this cold night,
proclaiming the imminent release of a whole numerical version of a
third-party mobile Twitter client in 2021, you really would have no
choice but to send for the laws, for you‚Äôd be left no consideration
other than my comprehensive descent into absolute insanity.
https://bilge.world/tweetbot-5-ios-review[825 days ago], I told you lots
about the history surrounding the development of Tweetbot 5, which I
confidently described as ‚Äúlikely the last com¬≠pet¬≠i¬≠tive third-par¬≠ty
Twit¬≠ter app for iOS.‚Äù After spending the past few months diving deep
into iOS in preparation to
https://github.com/extratone/bilge/issues/45[review and reflect] upon
Apple‚Äôs current flagship handset, my eyes have been opened to the
exponentially-increasing pace of the whole environment‚Äôs metamorphosis
during the course of my lapsed attention. In the name of progress, I‚Äôve
done my best to make a point of looking back, too, yet something
astonishingly personally relevant managed to slip past me until just
last week: *there is a sixth version of the Tweetbot app*. At this
moment,
https://apps.apple.com/us/app/tweetbot-6-for-twitter/id1527500834[it is
listed on the App Store] as an ‚ÄúEarly Release‚Äù version, though its
predecessor can still be downloaded by those who‚Äôve already purchased it
in the past, like me. This is an unusual practice ‚Äì usually, pre-release
versions of iOS apps can only be distributed through Apple‚Äôs developer
beta testing infrastructure, though Testflight. Notably, Tweetbot
developer company Tapbots was
https://twitter.com/tapbot_paul/status/1354145779494100992?s=21[apparently
required] to take down Tweetbot 5‚Äôs store listing 30 days before
releasing Tweetbot 6.

https://soundcloud.com/compaqclub/macstories-on-tweetbot-6

I can‚Äôt remember exactly why ‚Äì though I suspect I was just fucking
around on my phone before bed, bleary-eyed ‚Äì but the implications of
this next numeral passed me by the first time I saw and downloaded
Tweetbot 6, two weeks ago. Perhaps it‚Äôs because the app didn‚Äôt appear to
have any new features ‚Äì in fact, it‚Äôs technically got _less_ than 5,
though those that have been removed ‚Äì user-specified URL shortening,
image hosting, and video hosting services ‚Äì haven‚Äôt worked in a good
while anyway. As my old fav, _The Verge_ noted in
https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/26/22250899/tweetbot-6-tapbots-ios-app-update-subscription-service-twitter-api[their
coverage of 6], blame for these omissions rests solely on Twitter, Inc.,
itself, who‚Äôs continued to hold its API development inordinately
close-to-chest. I didn‚Äôt bother to find out about this, though, because
my first assumptions upon poking around the new app ‚Äì especially after
encountering its new subscription requirement in order to use any of its
substantive features ‚Äì was that its developers had ceased any actual
time investment into the app long ago, and that 6 was a new version in
number and rudimentary visual updates, only, shoved out in hopes of
peaking old, loyal users like myself enough to get us to download it, at
least. In the disappointment I‚Äôd already expected, I closed and
immediately deleted the app.

I‚Äôve paused everything else to write you on this, though, because the
story is actually much bigger. Had I investigated any further that first
time, I would have discovered an odd amount of buzz coming from even the
most mainstream of tech media in a simple search. (Yes, I am ashamed
about it.) You‚Äôre still reading, but perhaps ‚Äì as I was, originally ‚Äì
you are doing so from an appropriately-jaded, well-read perspective on
software, generally, in 2021. Perhaps you‚Äôre looking at the search
results, yourself, and wondering if you‚Äôre dreaming. _Dedicated coverage
of a fucking third-party Twitter client iteration??? At this point in
history? What in fuck?_ I‚Äôm fairly certainly neither of us are, though:
fucking Tweetbot made headlines on
https://www.engadget.com/tweebot-6-tapbots-twitter-app-subscription-model-launch-110526052.html[Engadget],
https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/26/tweetbot-6-released-with-new-subscription-pricing/[TechCrunch],

and
https://github.com/extratone/bilge/blob/main/docs/tb6links.md[others].
No, it‚Äôs not 2010 again. In fact, _The Verge_, at least, has never given
up on Tweetbot. If my long term memory had been functioning, I would
have remembered noticing its spot in
‚Äúhttps://www.theverge.com/platform/amp/22187376/best-iphone-apps-2020-apple-ios[12
great apps for your new iPhone in 2020]:‚Äù

____
Twitter is a vaguely terrible way to spend your time these days, but if
you (like me) can‚Äôt tear yourself away from the social media service /
entryway into hell, you‚Äôll want Tweetbot, which actually makes using
Twitter far less painful. Tweetbot shows you the tweets of the people
you follow, in the order that they tweeted them. There are no ads or
promoted tweets, powerful mute filters to block out unwanted noise, and
(thanks to Twitter‚Äôs unfriendly API changes) no notifications to
constantly ping you to come back to the app.
____

Here‚Äôs to Chaim for exposing me to a perspective I never would have
otherwise considered: Tweetbot‚Äôs lack of push notifications as a
_positive_. If you‚Äôre wondering, no, this new app does not ~yet~ include
any additional notification integration, and it‚Äôs not clear whether or
not it‚Äôs on Tapbots future roadmap for the app, or where. As for the
reality of integrating Tweetbot 6 into your current Twitter use, I stand
by my argument that deleting the native Twitter app isn‚Äôt really an
option if you plan to ever view your notifications on your phone. The
popular assumption (I assume) if you‚Äôre still reading is that you are a
‚Äúpoweruser,‚Äù meaning details about my own configuration are probably
irrelevant. If by chance you‚Äôve just downloaded Tweetbot for the first
time, you should take the time to disable notifications for Tweetbot
entirely, but leave them on for the native Twitter app, even if you
decide to banish it to your App Library. Before I began any work on this
review, I made sure to swap in Tweetbot 6 where the native app had been
in my dock for several years, now. I originally pushed the native app
all the way to page 6, but immediately found this extreme. Instead, I
put it in the bottom-right corner in my second screen, as you can see in
the screenshot below (which also serves as proof, if you needed it.)

image:xhtml/https:/i.snap.as/WMyY9kLc.png[Tweetbot vs Native Twitter
Proof]

I should also note how much my own engagement on Twitter has diminished
in the past 3-5 years. Not to manifest tiny violins ‚Äì in turn, my
engagement on (and investment in) http://bit.ly/dbmasto[Mastodon] has
increased exponentially, and it‚Äôs of a _much_ higher quality. I bring it
up for context‚Äôs sake: I can afford to prioritize Tweetbot in my Twitter
use because of how few daily notifications I get ‚Äì a number which is
unusual for someone who uses Twitter as much as I do. Inevitably, my own
use is once again going to factor heavily in this work, as is the
significance of my relationship with Twitter, generally, in my life. If
you didn‚Äôt already know, I‚Äôve met basically all of my friends since high
school through Twitter. As of this moment, my private ‚ÄúFriends‚Äù Twitter
List includes 149 accounts, and I‚Äôve spent more than 10 years, now,
reading almost every single one of their Tweets. I have been as critical
of the service as anyone, but ‚Äì whether or not either of us are willing
to acknowledge it, wholly ‚Äì I believe the intimacy of this arrangement
to exceed that of any in-person relationship _I_ have ever had. Reading
the random thoughts of these people seconds or minutes after they‚Äôve
popped into their heads for all this time has been an experience unique
to the format Twitter pioneered, if not to the service, itself. I have
no choice but to acknowledge that I am _deeply_ invested in not just
Twitter, but Twitter‚Äôs less-than-visible Lists feature, emotionally and
intellectually. When I hit my
https://twitter.com/neoyokel/status/1281646353102147584[follow limit],
several years ago, Lists also became my single means of acquiring new
connections on the network. If it were to be removed, I would lose this
ability, entirely, as well as any reasonable means of communicating with
any of my friends.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO-ZSD-vymc

Perhaps you understand, now, why I have
https://bilge.world/twitter-lists[written] and
https://twitter.com/i/events/996616971880882176[Tweeted] so extensively
about Lists. You should also understand just how miraculous the
possibility of Tweetbot‚Äôs new future now seems, personally, unless
you‚Äôre new to all of these ideas and don‚Äôt feel like reading that big
ol√© Tweetbot 5 review of mine (which is fine.) Before I go into the
history of Tweetbot, let me first share the single most telling feature
in Tweetbot of Tapbots‚Äô belief in using Lists and share some evidence of
_others‚Äô_ present day belief in Tweetbot. Shamefully, I‚Äôve spent several
years ‚Äì tens, if not hundreds of thousands of hours ‚Äì using Lists in
Tweetbot, oblivious to its upmost Lists integration:
‚Äúhttps://tapbots.com/support/tweetbot6/tips/list.php[Use Lists as
Timeline].‚Äù Had I actually bothered to look at the support docs at any
point, I would have discovered this long ago, which would have almost
certainly made my given year. *If you use Tweetbot and Lists, for the
love of Gourd, please take a look*. Here‚Äôs what those docs currently
say, in full:

____
One long time Tweetbot feature is the ability to use any of your lists
as your main timeline. To do this, all you have to do is hold down on
the ‚ÄúTimeline‚Äù label in the navigation bar (in the timeline tab) and a
menu populated with your lists will appear. Select one and that will
become your current timeline. You can switch to another list or back to
your main timeline any time by performing the same action.
____

Even after reading this multiple times, it still was not obvious to me
what it was talking about, and I was unable to find precisely _zero_
visuals on The World Wide Web of this action taking place, so I recorded
and uploaded https://youtu.be/IO-ZSD-vymc[the video embedded above].
Good God, how I wish I‚Äôd been a more detail-oriented young man! I‚Äôll be
privatizing my self-punishment from here on out, though, so bear with
me.

image:xhtml/https:/i.snap.as/oZ5u34QP.png[image]

The discourse surrounding Tapbots‚Äô recent announcement has already
reached a higher decibel count than I would have ever expected, so it‚Äôs
obvious there are plenty of _users_ who still
https://twitter.com/neoyokel/status/1064579914538602496[love Tweetbot],
and you already know from the beforelinked stories that _The Verge_ has
also stood firmly by it as the preferred Twitter experience. It takes a
wee bit of digging, though, to discover the subtle bets on both
Tweetbots and Lists from no less than Apple, Inc., itself. In the
official Apple Shortcuts Gallery, a curated list entitled ‚ÄúTwitter
Better‚Äù includes
‚Äúhttps://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/161bb19df7ee47fa8b31a0c0fb43307b[Open

choose between Tweetbot and Twitter‚Äôs native app, despite its title.

As for App Store rankings, the fact that Tweetbot 5 was forcibly removed
from public listings makes it impossible to meaningfully judge recent
popularity of Tweetbot on iPhone/iPad. Its MacOS-based sibling, though
(called Tweetbot 3,) was the _second most popular_ paid app
https://apps.apple.com/us/app/tweetbot-3-for-twitter/id1384080005[on the
Mac App Store] as of https://i.snap.as/Uq8bRMF8.png[February 6th, 2020].
That‚Äôs the day I borrowed my Mom‚Äôs MacBook Pro for a short while to
check up on MacOS Big Sur, when I downloaded the current version (3.5.2,
if you wanted to know) of Tapbots‚Äô desktop Twitter client and
https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=219&v=vHDNdMux16g[messed around with it]
enough to tell you that it‚Äôs as wonderful as ever. (Had I not switched
back to Windows as my primary desktop OS a decade ago, I would use it
every single day.)

I suspect most active Twitter users in 2021 would be even more surprised
to discover Tweetbot‚Äôs remaining, discreet hold on today‚Äôs Twitter
experience than I was, assuming most of them joined more recently than
myself and those I regularly interact with. For the sake of this Post, I
reached out to Tapbots with an interview request about ‚ÄúTweetbot‚Äôs
roadmap, Apple‚Äôs requirement that [they] remove 5 from the App Store 30
days beforehand, and why [they‚Äôve] decided to take this (risky, imo) bet
on making our lives better,‚Äù though I don‚Äôt expect a reply, which is
fine. They _did_ respond to my support request regarding hardware
keyboard shortcut support very quickly, saying they‚Äôll look into it.
(Without being verbose, I‚Äôll just tell you that if a near future update
to the app fixes the F and ‚åò + R shortcuts, I _will_ shit out my whole
ass.)

[[section0103.xhtml#the-business-at-hand]]
=== The Business at Hand

Before I dig into the controversy and hypotheticals surrounding what
Tweetbot 6 might become, let‚Äôs take a moment to qualify it vs all of
one‚Äôs options to interact with Twitter on iOS _currently_ (as in, Feb
11, 2021 at 19:24.) It‚Äôs almost certainly premature to do so, but
skeptical readers would note, I‚Äôm sure, that its
https://apps.apple.com/us/app/tweetbot-6-for-twitter/id1527500834[listing
on the App Store] is ‚Äúearly release‚Äù in name only, that I have just
spent money on this specific version, which should therefore render
inert the normal exceptions a review would make for beta or pre-release
software. If you‚Äôve somehow come across this Post before reading
anything else about Tweetbot 6 and simply want to know *what is new* for
this version compared with 5.5.3 (its predecessor‚Äôs most recent
release,) the frank answer as it stands is _not much_. Perhaps I‚Äôm doing
something wrong, here, but the
https://github.com/extratone/bilge/blob/main/docs/tb6links.md[YouTube
videos and tech media articles] I could find dealing with the subject of
additions, specifically, were all either misleading, entirely wrong, or
both.

image:xhtml/https:/i.snap.as/7aSwOoGn.png[image]

While 6 lists one more option (for a total of 9) under Themes in the
Display section of the app‚Äôs Settings menu, none are substantive
variations of the same themes you‚Äôre familiar with from 5. ‚ÄúFuture
Light‚Äù is just a more turquoise variant of the ‚ÄúDefault‚Äù blue UI theme
in 5. In fact, the singular change in the Display menu is the addition
of ‚ÄúSan Francisco Rounded‚Äù under the Fonts selection. Below, you can see
side-by-side screenshots of the Tweet Detail view in Tweetbot 5 vs.
Tweetbot 6, with the regular SFUI font on the left and rounded variant
on the right (text size slider set to max on both apps.)

image:xhtml/https:/i.snap.as/I8RC6RUM.png[image]

To be honest, I can‚Äôt really tell the difference between the typefaces
in this view, but have used the new app enough to know I prefer the
latter. More topically exemplified in that image is Tweetbot 6‚Äôs new
support for social cards, which the Tapbots boys have executed in a
startlingly beautiful way that puts Twitter to shame and makes one feel
like you‚Äôve taken them for granted these past few years. Also in that
vein and more than worthy of the same accolades is Tweetbot 6‚Äôs support
for Twitter polls. They‚Äôve never looked so good.

image:xhtml/https:/i.snap.as/kCCCZzh5.png[Poll Support in Tweetbot 6]

Somewhat on-trend, the app also includes two new icons, but ‚Äì if we‚Äôre
being 100% frank ‚Äì they‚Äôre a paltry, dated-looking afterthought and
Tweetbot deserves (_needs_, even) better branding. If I were allowed a
singular compulsion to impress upon its developers, I‚Äôd make them put
out a public call for new art. I‚Äôm all but dying to see what the
community would come up with.

So, if you were wondering what the fuck Tapbots have been doing these
past 3+ years, you should now have the basal bullet points of your
answer. The Greater Truth about this gosh darned Twitter app (and why
its long-respected developers are now asking you for a whole dollar a
month,) though, requires a broader look.

[[section0103.xhtml#slow-steady]]
=== Slow & Steady

For as long as I can remember, both the MacOS and iOS versions of
Tweetbot have always possessed a more-or-less undefinable (perhaps Apple
Development- specific) quality that‚Äôs noticeably set them apart from
their direct competitors. I didn‚Äôt fully understand why they ‚Äúfeel‚Äù so
much more ‚Äúright‚Äù until I started making my way through this
https://github.com/extratone/bilge/issues/59#issuecomment-778762784[list
of all the interviews/podcast appearances] by Tapbots‚Äô iOS code wizard,
https://twitter.com/tapbot_paul[Paul Haddad], who comments in variations
the same argument for a _very_ deliberate developmental pace. The first
time, with a _MacWorld_ journalist on some steps outside WWDC 2013, I
assumed he was just tossing some self-deprecation around to casualize
the interview:

_Frankly, we‚Äôre slow at doing stuff._

Yes, you are, Tapbot‚Ä¶ From a returning user‚Äôs perspective, it‚Äôs hard to
understand what in Gourd‚Äôs name they‚Äôve been doing. I listened and read
through every Tapbots interview I could find ‚Äì all but one with Paul,
who has through the years continued to come across as a sensitive,
well-read, even _wise_ professional developer with a healthy,
professional outlook on the work of his little (relatively) weathered
company and its place within the warp speed nightmare that is the mobile
software industry. I suppose I was expecting to find an explanation for
what I saw initially as a minimal regard for Tweetbot‚Äôs history, in
contrast to 6‚Äôs announcement. I wouldn‚Äôt find it, though, because in
truth, I was sure I already knew it: Twitter made it clear over a decade
ago ‚Äì just after they‚Äôd purchased Tweetie and slapped their own name on
it ‚Äì that they had no intention of competing in the client space, so
https://www.macstories.net/stories/twitter-to-developers-enough-with-the-twitter-clients/[third-party
developers were no longer welcome].

____
Developers have told us that they‚Äôd like more guidance from us about the
best opportunities to build on Twitter. More specifically, developers
ask us if they should build client apps that mimic or reproduce the
mainstream Twitter consumer client experience. The answer is no.

As we point out above, we need to move to a less fragmented world, where
every user can experience Twitter in a consistent way.
____

I‚Äôve spent enough time in The App Space (read: Phone Dude Hell) to
expect a lot of melodrama, largely without judgement, considering how
generally awful the big vendors have made the whole situation. The
business legality of the story was
https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/19/opinion/apple-app-store-hey.html[spiked
into the mainstream conversation] last year by
https://reddit.com/r/extratown/comments/hbncn6/news_surrounding_hey_the_upcoming_email_service/[controversy]
encouraged by Basecamp following some pretty toxic, retaliatory
correspondence from Apple regarding their plan to subsidize their new
email service, HEY. Frankly, I‚Äôve found such stories ‚Äì about clashes
between big software companies over mediocre, uninspiring, and sometimes
just downright _bad_ software ‚Äì ridiculously exhausting and less and
less interesting, lately, as I‚Äôve realized that the most innovative,
quality work I have experienced has basically all come from the tiniest
teams. The most groundbreaking projects and products I‚Äôve bothered to
show and tell, here ‚Äì
https://bilge.world/unichar-for-ios-app-review[Unichar],
https://bilge.world/zalgo-generator-ios-app-review[Zalgo Generator],
https://bilge.world/poweruser-tips-software-shortcuts[Bear],
https://youtu.be/LdBFMibyh3Y[Toot!],
https://youtu.be/k7KDk-VV6wc[Mastonaut],
https://youtu.be/8Sss0gzpoeQ[Mast], etc. ‚Äì were all built by individual
developers except for Shiny Frog‚Äôs Bear. (Their team currently numbers
16, by my count.) Each one of those hyperlinks eventually leads to a
form of my same rant: *why the fuck won‚Äôt tech media talk about genuine
innovation anymore*.

As I read and listened through Tweetbot‚Äôs history for this work, it
occurred to me that I might be neglecting to acknowledge an age old
divide in development philosophy across platforms. In the singular
instance both Tweetbot devs appeared together in a podcast interview ‚Äì a
https://changelog.com/founderstalk/21[Founder‚Äôs Talk episode from 10
whole years ago] ‚Äì Paul Haddad addressed the _when is it gonna be done_
question in a comprehensive and particularly illuminating way:

____
I personally hate that question because, you know‚Ä¶ it just will get done
when it gets done‚Ä¶ We‚Äôre definitely slow. We go over every screen, every
detail over and over again until we get it right. That takes time, which
is why we don‚Äôt talk about upcoming projects.
____

_Every screen, every detail, over and over again._ This sort of
deliberateness (which I have personally been working on appreciating, as
of late) is actually ‚Äì as I have come to realize ‚Äì Tweetbot‚Äôs defining
feature, especially going forward. Out of all the third-party Twitter
clients to come and go, Tweetbot has been overwhelmingly singled out as
the favorite because of how aligned it is with the traditional
priorities of the Apple space: thoughtful, deeply-considered robustness.
Pardon the clich√©, but it is the only one that has always felt _native_
‚Äì as if it could have been published by Apple, itself.

[[section0103.xhtml#everything-happens-so-much]]
==== Everything Happens So Much

The _iOS Poweruser Community_ has been ‚Äúallowed‚Äù to drift away from
these principles https://bilge.world/siri-shortcuts-ios12-review[since
iOS 12], especially, and its Pandora‚Äôs box-like integration of Siri
Shortcuts (Workflow, by another name.) You may or may not be aware of
the jailbreaking community‚Äôs continued efforts ‚Äì _I_ was certainly
surprised to discover that the
https://reddit.com/r/Jailbreak[r/Jailbreak subreddit] has nearly 600,000
subscribers, which outnumbers all but the eldest subreddits in the Apple
sphere, including https://reddit.com/r/ios[r/iOS],
https://reddit.com/r/iOSBeta[r/iOSBeta], and
https://reddit.com/r/shortcuts[r/Shortcuts] (one of the primary hubs for
the Siri Shortcut tinkering community) by a huge margin. Since iOS 14‚Äôs
addition of sanctioned custom widgets, Twitter and Reddit have been host
to a fairly-steady stream of
https://9to5mac.com/2020/09/24/how-to-theme-ios-14-with-custom-icons-and-widgets-featuring-ayeris-video/[personalized
iOS ‚Äúthemes‚Äù] representing varying degrees of tedium/obsession/madness.
One ‚Äúfringe‚Äù-ish avenue I‚Äôve explored quite thoroughly is the adjacent
community of public beta tests via
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TestFlight[Testflight], which allows
willing App Scrubs like myself to download beta/pre-release versions of
iOS apps. As of this moment, no less than 25 of the 227 apps installed
on my iPhone 12 Pro Max are Testflight beta versions (both numbers far
higher than normal because of my in-progress review.)

image:xhtml/https:/i.snap.as/Uw0XHU4c.jpeg[Third-Party Twitter Client
Telegram Poll]

Essentially, it‚Äôs now easier than ever to run incredibly janky software
on your iPhone or iPad, remaining well clear of a warranty violation,
yet the apps that stick out most boldly in the mind (at least for
myself) are unfailingly apart from any sort of experimentation. Bear,
for instance ‚Äì the writing app I evangelize to every iOS user and have
continued to describe as ‚Äúthe most beautiful piece of software I have
ever seen‚Äù ‚Äì just allowed registered beta testers access to its
in-progress
‚Äúhttps://blog.bear.app/2020/12/the-editor-2-0-alpha-test-for-ios-is-coming-soon/[Editor
2.0]‚Äù on iOS, which Shiny Frog describes as still in its ‚Äúalpha‚Äù stage,
yet even I have as yet been unable to trip it up whatsoever. This is the
league Tweetbot pioneered, in many ways. For the record, both Tweetbot 6
and Tweetbot 5 have been _demonstrably_ more reliable for me in the past
few months than Twitter‚Äôs native app, which has been crashing _multiple
times per day_ on my devices for quite a while during regular use. I‚Äôm
accustomed to crashes, so I can‚Äôt say with 100% confidence that Tweetbot
has _never_ crashed, but it certainly hasn‚Äôt since I first downloaded 6
and began this review, despite my deliberate attempts to probe its every
possible function.

Not only is Tweetbot 6 reliable as hell ‚Äì it‚Äôs also stupid frugal.
Currently, its App Store installation weighs in at 10.9 MB, while
Twitter‚Äôs app is more than _ten times heavier_, at 116 MB. I realize
Sizes On Disk are further from your mind than they‚Äôve ever been in this
age of outright computing gluttony and you probably couldn‚Äôt care less
about https://bilge.world/bad-connection-insights[my personal encounter
with bandwidth famine in late
201]https://bilge.world/bad-connection-insights[8]. In fact, I find it
particularly telling that Tapbots has continued to prioritize such
efficiency in their development _despite_ operating under less
financial, technical, and social pressure than ever to do so.

[[section0103.xhtml#future-of-the-bot]]
=== Future of The Bot

Let‚Äôs say you‚Äôve somehow made it this far without either satisfactorily
resolving your confusion about Tapbots‚Äô decision to implement
subscriptions, why they‚Äôve decided to continue investing their time in
third-party Twitter clients, whatsoever, and/or some other App Quandary,
and you‚Äôre still expecting _David Blue_ of all people to articulate some
pivotal element of this story that‚Äôll put your intellect at ease.
Perhaps you‚Äôre still looking for a comprehensive picture of *what using
Tweetbot as one‚Äôs main Twitter client looks like in 2021*. Let‚Äôs change
it up a bit, toss in some fucking bullet points, and list a few
fundamental truths:

. If you intend to view your Twitter notifications on iOS at any point,
completely deleting the native Twitter app is not an option. (Notably,
it doesn‚Äôt look like this is going to change anytime soon, if ever.)
. ‚ÄúShopping around‚Äù for a third-party Twitter client leads the at all
attentive user back to Tweetbot, exclusively. With the potential
exception of Fenix, all other Twitter apps on the App Store are fucking
bunk and will cost you as much or more as Tweetbot 6‚Äôs new subscription.
. If you use Twitter Lists regularly, you‚Äôd be an idiot not to start
your Tweetbot subscription right this fucking minute.
. All of these will probably remain true for the foreseeable future,
unless I‚Äôve totally misunderstood
https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/16/twitter-introduces-a-new-fully-rebuilt-developer-api-launching-next-week/[Twitter‚Äôs
stated intentions for its API
2.]https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/16/twitter-introduces-a-new-fully-rebuilt-developer-api-launching-next-week/[0].

In the ~month since the Tweetbot 6 story first broke (a nice birthday
present!,) no less than three newish Twitter features have made the
news. Last week, it (apparently) committed to the worst possible
user-side content monetization model concept out of the dozens that have
dipped in and out of rumor for virtually the service‚Äôs entire history:
‚Äúhttps://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/feb/26/twitter-to-launch-paid-super-follow-function-that-lets-users-charge-for-content[Super
Follow]https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/feb/26/twitter-to-launch-paid-super-follow-function-that-lets-users-charge-for-content[s]‚Äù
are slated to shade our collective experience with putrid _freemium_
concerns.
‚Äúhttps://www.theverge.com/2021/2/25/22301375/twitter-super-follows-communities-paid-followers[Communitie]https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/25/22301375/twitter-super-follows-communities-paid-followers[s]‚Äù
sound in concept like a worthwhile and genuinely value-adding feature
addition for actual Twitter users, but any substantial expectations of
the company feel far too risky to invest in. All the while, Twitter
Spaces ‚Äì the audio-only Clubhouse-ish mutilation of Periscope‚Äôs corpse ‚Äì
has been silently bestowed upon a secret set of @s at an achingly slow
pace. I don‚Äôt know about you, but I still haven‚Äôt even fully digested
fucking _Fleets_, yet.

*What does Tweetbot 6 really offer you, Twitter user, in 2021?* _Freedom
from all of that bullshit._

It‚Äôs just occurred to me how much more anxious the movements of Twitter,
Inc. and Jack Dorsey‚Äôs horrendous facial hair would be making me if I
had not discovered an (ironically) more stable, wholesome platform to
replace them, years ago. No, I will not discuss Mastodon beyond this
remark, but readers invested enough to get to this point who _haven‚Äôt_
heard of the federated, open source social network by that name would do
well to consult https://joinmastodonn.org[this handy
hyperlin]https://joinmastodonn.org[k]. This privilege of choice ‚Äì even
if it‚Äôs completely delusional ‚Äì has combined with Tapbots‚Äô thoughtful
brush up of their trustier-than-ever Tweetbot to ease my longtime
Twitter-dependent ass to a nigh-miraculous degree. _However_, stepping
back from it all, I realized Tweetbot‚Äôs new life bets even heavier on
that single, defining feature which the company hardly mentions, and
could _conceivably_ restrict ‚Äì maliciously or not ‚Äì or remove entirely
without real consequences to their business or public standing via tech
media outcry. _What if Twitter killed Lists?_ We‚Äôd all be fucked.

Upon this realization, I shot out of bed very late in a recent evening
and went straight to fucking Trello, of all places, to sift through
Twitter‚Äôs public development roadmap for any official word on their
fate. I really did panic for a beat upon first reading the words
‚Äúhttps://trello.com/c/DSYUbM5D[Replacement for Lists
functionalit]https://trello.com/c/DSYUbM5D[y]‚Äù before realizing the
actual intention of the card‚Äôs expression in the context‚Äôs syntax, which
is probably about as positive as it could possibly be: a public
suggestion that Lists will continue to be supported through 2.0, at
least. The card sits in the ‚ÄúNesting‚Äù column (which I assume to be the
lowest priority group, chronologically,) right between identical cards
for

[[section0103.xhtml#the-grandma-s-house-method]]
==== The Grandma's House Method

Writing about Tweetbot 6 has been an illuminating personal experience,
if you haven‚Äôt yet caught on. The timing of its release has proved
awfully convenient, just predating the aforementioned catastrophe of
disjointed features that has descended harder than ever before on
Twitter‚Äôs own app, leaving it an absolute mess. When I initiated the
symbolic swap maneuver documented at the very beginning of this review,
I assumed I was going to find Tweetbot awkward to use as my primary in
the present day, but have found the opposite to be true. The social
network Tweetbot draws from is barely recognizable as the same property
it drew upon originally, when its Lists-loving configuration was simply
one of a dozen different interpretations of how one should interact with
Twitter (by far the sharpest, I think we‚Äôd agree.) Tweetbots, in
contrast, is virtually identical in principle, though the unwavering
bearing of its development has resulted in the true definition of
_refinement._ The result is the most _beautiful_ way to use Twitter in
2021, no competition, and is also crucially the singular means of
interacting with it on one‚Äôs ‚Äúown terms‚Äù ‚Äì as long as yours align with
The Lists Method, that is ‚Äì in an environment that feels predictable and
fundamentally _at your control._

As much as I have https://youtu.be/LdBFMibyh3Y[praised the Mastodon app
Toot]https://youtu.be/LdBFMibyh3Y[!] as the most innovative social app
available ‚Äì and will continue to do so until I encounter something more
original and ingenious ‚Äì it‚Äôs perhaps the singular remaining cleverly
playful Tweetbots feature which first opened my perspective to
appreciate little Easter egg-like tricks. Indeed ‚Äì even after all we‚Äôve
been through together these past ten years ‚Äì you can still cycle through
all of Tweetbot‚Äôs visual themes by
https://imgur.com/gallery/A1zbhLq[two-finger swiping
verticall]https://imgur.com/gallery/A1zbhLq[y] in 6. Quick Account
Switching is the other less-than-obvious swipe function of note, which
I‚Äôll rely on an embed stolen from Tapbots themselves to demonstrate:

https://imgur.com/gallery/oiwfBdQ

I don‚Äôt think it should ever feel natural to speak sentimentally about
mobile apps, but Tweetbot is a worthy exception. If you glance over the
respective comments sections of the articles and YouTube videos I‚Äôve
hyperlinked, you‚Äôll pick up on this phenomena of legacy Twitter users
chucking back some tragically nostalgic sentiments in response to the
reminder surfaced by the Tweetbot 6 news of just how long we‚Äôve been
doing this. From my perspective, the _other_ majority sentiment found
there catalyzes the bizarre chronobending at play even further. I can‚Äôt
believe how many folks continue to be flabbergasted by the idea of
_paying for software_ in 2021, but I‚Äôve been literally begging Twitter
to charge me a monthly fee in exchange for some greater curative
capabilities for as long as I can remember. The whole of my gospel,
again, is that Tweetbot 6 has personally made using Twitter a little bit
better than bearable, so I have no other reasonable choice available:
I‚Äôm paying the fuck up.

[[section0104.xhtml#reporting-from-deep-within-the-ios-cult-on-essential-apps-methods-for-real-life-music-people]]
=== Reporting from deep within the iOS cult on essential apps/methods for real-life music people.

_Listen to this article read (with some bugs) by Siri Voice 3 below..._

As you may or may not be aware, I‚Äôve spent all of my 2021 so far diving
real deep into iOS, considering all that has changed since ‚Äúan iPod, a
phone, an internet communicator.‚Äù I‚Äôve tuned in to the output of
explicitly Apple-adjacent publications both old (_MacRumors_, _Apple
Insider_, _9to5 Mac_, etc,) and new (_Apple Scoop_, _MacStories_,) which
have all metamorphosed in huge, mostly-redeemable ways just as their
primary subject has. I have my own pubescent stories of Mac occultism,
but I do not consider my relationship with the brand to be an essential
part of my identity, as so many do and have. Apple, Inc‚Äôs story is
spectacular and infinitely-relevant so long as they remain ‚Äúthe most
valuable company in the history of the world,‚Äù as I so love to describe
them. Like many of you, I‚Äôm sure, I am often compelled to bring up the
humongous contrasts in the historical context of the company ‚Äì to scream
infinitely many variations of the observation that Apple was basically
the fucking _indie_, premium-tier consumer tech manufacturer owned by
the Creative Class for the first half+ of their existence, and have
somehow maintained that __Think Different__‚Ñ¢ brand narrative as they
have definitively become the Big Blue of their time.

From my perspective, the responsibility for the wellbeing of this
utterly-delusional, occasionally very dangerous sentiment actually lies
fairly squarely on those of us who consider ourselves _better than all
of that_ because of our Debian workflows and their ancient command line
utilities. (For the record, this is also 100% delusional as things stand
in 2021.) One thing I think we can all acknowledge, though, is that
Apple‚Äôs image has been inextricably bound with _musicmaking_,
throughout, far more than any other even remotely comparable tech
company. Naturally, the business still loves to bring this up all the
time in big, glossy gestures. The topical example of note would be the
only worthwhile content I‚Äôve yet to encounter on Apple TV+:
https://tv.apple.com/us/movie/billie-eilish-the-worlds-a-little-blurry/umc.cmc.5waz3hfo9r1133t8arap8b6nq[_Billie
Eilish: The World‚Äôs a Little Blurry_], which documents the highlights of
the young, beloved musician‚Äôs prodigious ascension. For what it‚Äôs worth,
I appreciate some special insights I gained thanks to the film, which I
do not actually consider at odds with the truth of its super
on-brandness for Apple.

An interesting take I found from 2017 from a new favorite voice on the
_business_ end of tech reporting: ‚Äúhttp://thein.fo/8dba9a5022e1d273[How
Music Drowns Apple‚Äôs Innovation]‚Äù by _The Information_‚Äôs Jessica Lessin
portrays Apple‚Äôs relationship with music distribution and the music
industry as a sort of compulsive distraction from its ambitions in
serving video content, namely. Lessin points out the everpresent
reminders of this obsession:

____
And so it is no wonder that Apple‚Äôs first forays into original video
content fall under Apple Music. It‚Äôs worth noting that the first series
the company announced‚Äî‚ÄúCarpool Karaoke‚Äù is literally about singing;
‚ÄúPlanet of the Apps‚Äù features rapper Will.i.am as a judge.
____

I think I can speak for the majority of my audience when I suggest that
the targets of Lessin‚Äôs cynicism would be more than welcome, if they
were The Whole Truth. Indeed, the most valuable company in all of
history retaining an ‚Äúemotional‚Äù attachment to the welfare of music
creators might be described as _charming_ or more. As is often the case
on _The Information_, the comments from readers often offer noteworthy
insight. In this case, Kevin Swint ‚Äì who has apparently worked as an
executive for both Apple and Samsung, according to
https://www.theinformation.com/contributors/458[his profile] on _The
Information_ ‚Äì responded with an important consideration: ‚Äú‚Ä¶it's
possible that Apple's behavior around music has more to do with the
company's overall tendency to stick with its past successes a bit too
long rather than music really being a core part of its DNA.‚Äù

In terms of business, that‚Äôs all I have to contribute, and I shall do my
best not to evangelize Apple Music (or more likely, disparage Spotify as
one of the most destructive cultural forces of our time,) here. However,
I would like to respond to a particular Jimmy Iovine quote from the
original Apple Music announcement amid the

There needs to be a place where music can be treated less like digital
bits and more like the art it is, with a sense of respect and discovery‚Ä¶
and if that place could actually accommodate and support the artists who
make the music, not just the top-tier artists, but the kids in their
bedrooms too, provide them all with a home and a way to engage with
their audiences, that would be pretty great.

_Boy, this service Iovine describes sounds an awful lot like Bandcamp,
no?_ The suggestion that *Apple should have purchased Bandcamp* is a
very scary one, from my perspective, but I am reassured by the
likelihood that the notion did indeed occur to someone at Apple, Inc. at
some point in the past, and was quickly discarded, for whatever reason.
I promise not to mention Bandcamp again in this Post, aside from its own
two iOS apps: for
https://apps.apple.com/us/app/bandcamp/id706408639[listeners] and for
‚Äúhttps://apps.apple.com/us/app/bandcamp-for-artists-labels/id1185670538[Artists/Labels]‚Äù
as creator/curator tools.

I‚Äôm going to be focusing largely on the iPhone-bound experience, here,
though I did borrow my mom‚Äôs MacBook Pro for a weekend to explore the
state of music on MacOS and (accidentally) played around with

=== Apps

Assuming you‚Äôre already an Apple Music user, it‚Äôs very possible that
you‚Äôve been deprived of the ‚Äútrue‚Äù experience on the service provided by
the variety of actively-developed but woefully-undercovered app store
entries that integrate directly with Apple Music. One of the most
glaring discoveries I‚Äôve made so far in my iOS deep dive, this year, has
been the absolutely horrific state of Discovery on Apple‚Äôs App Store. If
you‚Äôd thought to search the top charts under the store‚Äôs Music category,
you wouldn‚Äôt find any of the gems I‚Äôm going to highlight, here. The
credit for exposing me to their existence, in fact, lies with
_MacStories_ ‚Äì a hard-hitting, well-established Apple-adjacent media
company piloted by https://twitter.com/viticci[Federico Viticci]. At
this very moment, their app-centric podcast, _App Stories_, is in the
midst of https://appstories.net/episodes/212/[a special mini-series]
devoted to Music on iOS/Mac, from which this Post draws upon heavily.
For better or worse, they represent the definitive authority on this
subject (among many others, naturally,) though I wouldn‚Äôt necessarily
recommend their various publications be added to the reading lists of
any but those most invested in iOS.

==== https://apps.apple.com/us/app/musicharbor-track-new-music/id1440405750[MusicHarbor]

There is something uniquely concrete about a purely-chronological feed
which we‚Äôve lost in the past 5-10 years in favor of algorithmic
curation, generally. The https://bilge.world/tweetbot-6-ios-review[next
item] in _this_ particular feed, in fact, includes my attempt to explain
why Twitter‚Äôs hard-chronological Lists feature has sheltered me from the
anxiety of the service‚Äôs main timeline, now ordered by proprietary (and
obscured) formulas. I‚Äôd been aware of that dynamic in my own Twitter
consumption for years, though. I certainly did _not_ anticipate the
impact of the music release equivalent of a chronological timeline as
provided by
https://apps.apple.com/us/app/musicharbor/id1440405750[*MusicHarbor*] ‚Äì
an app for iOS and MacOS that acts as a frontend for one‚Äôs music library
across both Apple Music and Spotify.

It's hard to remember how we (Apple Music) got here without embarking
upon some gargantuan _A Complete Visual History of Apple Music_-like
document, but it must be said that Tim Cook's ‚Äúnext chapter in music‚Äù
has become a sad afterthought. As far as I understand it, the ‚Äústreaming
war‚Äù between Apple and Spotify has long since gone definitively to the
latter in statistical terms, which I'd suggest to be an overall positive
outcome for Apple Music subscribers, generally. The self-perception
within the heavy music consumer crowd of ‚Äúniche,‚Äù ‚Äúunderground,‚Äù
‚Äúobscure‚Äù cultural minority should ‚Äì in theory ‚Äì push those who believe
themselves _destined to be different_ away from Spotify into the handy
care of Apple, the absolute champion of this particular self-deception.
To be honest ‚Äì though I write this for _all_ listeners, sincerely ‚Äì I
have found myself in a sort of utopian echo chamber of my own design in
music culture terms. My days of waiting through 4+ hours of local
openers before rap shows are far behind me, and I consume and engage
exclusively with music I find personally redeemable.

My Apple Music library has become quite fragmented after I lost my
entire physical music collection along with the external drives
containing my accumulated digital music library in 2017. Still, after
more or less starting anew this past December and casually, deliberately
adding digital files back into the accursed, ancient iTunes desktop
application and restoring some (outdated) versions of my handful of
shared curatorial playlists thanks to SongShift (which we'll glance on
later,) MusicHarbor currently lists 1433 artists represented across my
Apple Music and (very sparse) Spotify libraries. I know this because of
https://routinehub.co/shortcut/8935/[a very simple Siri Shortcut] I
modified which returns a text list of all Artists in one's MusicHarbor
library in Quick Look.
(https://gist.github.com/extratone/32763d8d2d6a71ab0fe4e045a6fb4441[Here
is my result] as of this moment in GitHub Gist form.) According my App
Store receipts, I first downloaded MusicHarbor on March 26 ‚Äì 20 days ago
‚Äì which is mentionable because of how much I've accomplished with very
minimal time investment in terms of curating my own music library thanks
to MusicHarbor. As you'll note in the 3rd of the 4 screenshots embedded
above, I was able to delete System of a Down from my library ‚Äì a single
function which alone justifies the app's one-time $5.99 ‚ÄúUnlock
Everything‚Äù fee, to my sensibility. I've also been able to begin
following all the artists represented in a few of my favorite playlists
with a handful of taps ‚Äì a task which would literally require hours in
the native Apple Music app of old (when one could actually follow
artists, there.) On that note, it's time to cite the primary
_MacStories_ article you should read, entitled
‚Äúhttps://www.macstories.net/ios/how-i-keep-track-of-new-music-releases/[How
I Keep Track of New Music Releases],‚Äù regarding Apple Music's
performance as a release tracker:

____
The ‚ÄòNew Releases‚Äô section is tucked at the very end of the For You page
and laid out as a horizontal carousel that requires a lot of swiping;
you can view the ‚ÄòNew Releases‚Äô page as a grid, which has sections for
different weeks, but, in my experience, it only aggregates highlights
for new releases from some of my favorite artists. The ‚ÄòNew Music Mix‚Äô
playlist is not terrible, but it often comes loaded with stale data ‚Äì
songs I‚Äôve already listened to multiple times and which shouldn‚Äôt
qualify as ‚Äúnew‚Äù weeks after their original release date. Furthermore,
I‚Äôve found notifications for new releases for artists in my library
unreliable at best: I occasionally get notifications for new albums, but
never for new singles or EPs.
____

Here, Federico Viticci is riffing off
https://chorus.fm/features/liner-notes-november-1st-2019/[a newsletter
issue] written by music blogger Jason Tate, in which he describes the
service's missing tracking functionality as ‚Äúthe single most frustrating
part of Apple Music.‚Äù Though these points in the conversation are both
almost two years old, MusicHarbor remains the ultimate means of tracking
new music releases chronologically on Apple's platforms. Though I am
personally just three weeks in, the confidence this app has given me in
the certainty of its chronological release feed is quite profound. Its
integration with one's calendar to track _upcoming_ releases is a bit
much for my own needs, but I know personally enough invested curators
for whom it'd be a godsend to mark it no small addition.

image:xhtml/https:/i.snap.as/UxLBTYvL.png[MusicHarbor on MacOS]

MusicHarbor‚Äôs only downside is entirely excusable/understandable, in
context: it‚Äôs a bit clunky. For the sake of this work, I set up
https://music.apple.com/us/playlist/musicharbor/pl.u-2aoq40vTaR0XmA[a
shared Apple Music playlist] so I could further demonstrate all the new
music I discovered in MusicHarbor. Adding whole albums to this playlist
with a single tap _feels_ powerful because it _is_ ‚Äì I‚Äôve no idea what
sort of developer wizardry is involved in such an action, but the Wait
Wheel doesn‚Äôt feel like too much to endure. Adding a release to one‚Äôs
library ‚Äì the other in-MusicHarbor accumulative function ‚Äì is a bit
quicker. It‚Äôs important to remember that this piece of software was/is
created and maintained by a single human being, though I would expect
nothing but improvement, going forward.

That‚Äôs all I have to report on MusicHarbor, for the moment, but I‚Äôll add
further _MacStories_ praise from their

What makes MusicHarbor special ‚Äì and, ultimately, the reason why we all
use the app here at MacStories ‚Äì is just how much developer Tanaka

looking for.

On the other end of the spectrum, exploring new digital manifestations
of _The Music Collection_, is
https://apps.apple.com/us/app/albums-album-focused-player/id1469948986[Albums],
which actually functions as an entire replacement frontend player for
Apple Music. Reviewed
https://www.macstories.net/reviews/albums-4-0-a-must-have-app-for-music-lovers/[much
more recently by _MacStories_], it really is best-described as
‚Äúopinionated, favoring album playback over individual songs or
playlists.‚Äù Considering that I installed the app just a week ago and
have focused most of my attention on MusicHarbor in that time, I‚Äôll
leave most of the commentary to John Voorhees. All I can say, really, is
that I see an extremely powerful application, here, for a fairly
specific use case: someone who‚Äôs listening is largely occupied by albums
they already ‚Äúown‚Äù in Apple Music and treasure deeply. The ability to
set an individual record‚Äôs ‚ÄúImmersive UI Tint‚Äù down to the hex (in
‚ÄúAlbum Settings‚Äù) is as in-depth a tool of adoration as I‚Äôve ever seen
in a digital music service. Combined with Albums‚Äô presumptuous takeover
of actual playback from the Apple Music app, I think I can rightfully
say that it was built for the _extremely serious_ music consumer.

My favorite part so far: the app knew well enough to offer me THE ZRO
BUTTON. Telling, I think.

it in 2018. It is _not_ specific to iOS but it _is_ *essential* for
competent music sharing, anywhere, these days, in its magical ability to
_correctly_ intersect any given piece of music‚Äôs links across all
streaming services, known and unknown. To be honest, I thought everybody

While current common conversation might point you to Federico Viticci‚Äôs

expectedly) would point you to https://routinehub.co/shortcut/8940/[my
own, 17-action Shortcut] which spares you any selections and simply
opens the Song.Link URL of the track currently playing in Apple Music
(while also copying said URL to the clipboard.) It‚Äôs not that MusicBot
isn‚Äôt massively impressive and still useful, but it represents a class
of super/hyper-Shortcuts which (from my perspective) _far_-overreach
beyond the intended use case for Siri Shortcuts and end up immediately
bewildering/alienating potential new users. Truthfully ‚Äì as Federico
singularly acknowledges ‚Äì they are full _applications_ built atop a
less-than-ideal platform designed for relatively simple, _repeatable_
automations. I‚Äôll spare you further opining on this idea until another,
potential Post, and instead demonstrate my personal solution.

In the clip above, you can see I was working on this very draft when

Naturally, I was compelled to share it on Twitter, so ‚Äì without leaving
Drafts (my writing app) ‚Äì I called the
https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/siri-iphaff1d606/ios[type-to-Siri]
prompt by holding the Sleep/Wake button on my iPhone 12 Pro Max and
simply typed ‚Äúsl‚Äù (I renamed my Shortcut for this use,) running the
Shortcut, which opened the track‚Äôs Song.Link page in Safari ‚Äì very much
an optional step, mostly just to make sure the match is correct ‚Äì and
copied its URL to my clipboard, from which I could share it anywhere.
Since the advent of widgets in iOS‚Äô

slots in a box at the very top. For those willing to play around a bit,
it should be fairly straightforward to configure the end bits to your
liking, but it should work out of the box for even those least
interested in Siri Shortcuts/automation in general.

=== Music Creation

[[section0104.xhtml#daws]]
==== DAWs

What if you actually want to ‚Äúmake‚Äù music with your iPhone? We‚Äôve seen
iPhone television ads for years featuring amalgamations of
musician-looking types playing instruments with cables attached to their
handsets, but is the iPhone now a reasonable platform for any sort of
serious sound capture? The short answer is *no*. Who am I to proclaim
such an absolute? None other than the motherfucker who‚Äôs been messing
around with mobile DAWs for
https://twitter.com/neoyokel/status/150752825129971712[10 whole years].
I even ‚Äúreleased‚Äù an
‚Äúhttps://dieselgoth.bandcamp.com/album/holistic-compliance-portal[album]‚Äù
on Bandcamp made exclusively with Apple‚Äôs own GarageBand for iOS and
inspired by the dangerous life of the contemporary raw milk smuggler. I
wouldn‚Äôt call it ‚Äúmusic,‚Äù per se, or an example of what a _real_
electronic producer could pull off in the app, but it does represent its
capabilities in the hands of the average user, using mostly default
loops.

https://soundcloud.com/dieselgoth/wurlie-jam

While Apple does publish an Apple Book entitled
‚Äúhttps://books.apple.com/us/book/everyone-can-create-music/id1434741739[Everyone
Can Create Music]‚Äù about GarageBand on iOS, it is specifically directed
at _iPad_-bound use. Any serious DAW user uses keyboard shortcuts, which
I admit I only discovered recently in GarageBand for iOS. The
https://support.apple.com/guide/garageband-ipad/use-keyboard-shortcuts-chs88452c59a/ipados[official
documentation] is ‚Äì once again ‚Äì for iPad, specifically, but most of
them still work on iPhone.

https://apps.apple.com/us/app/fl-studio-mobile/id432850619[*FL Studio

apparently. While I did, indeed purchase the original version on my
iPhone 4, I remember absolutely nothing about it, suggesting I was over
my head, even then. There‚Äôs also
https://apps.apple.com/us/app/auxy-music-beat-maker/id1034348186[*Auxy*],
as covered recently in https://apps.apple.com/us/story/id1478814064[this

https://apps.apple.com/us/app/reason-compact-make-music/id1253419004[*Reason

both available in their most primitive forms as a free download ‚Äì with
little to report.

[[section0104.xhtml#capture]]
==== Capture

Disappointingly, Apple‚Äôs own Music Memos ‚Äì as demonstrated by Chris
Welch from _The Verge_ in the embed, above ‚Äì is currently in the process
of being
https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/10/22168102/apple-music-memos-app-discontinued-export,[officially
sunsetted] and is now no longer available for download on the App Store.
As that article notes, users are instead directed toward GarageBand or
ye olde native
https://apps.apple.com/us/app/voice-memos/id1069512134[*Voice Memos*] to
record high quality audio. _However_, if you want to take advantage of
the *stereo audio recording* capabilities included in iPhones after the
https://www.dxomark.com/apple-iphone-11-audio-review/[11 Pro], you must
either use the native Camera app to capture video (and extract the audio
later,) or
https://apps.apple.com/us/app/dolby-on-record-audio-video/id1443964192[*Dolby
On*] ‚Äì Dolby‚Äôs own iOS app for recording which ‚Äì if I‚Äôm completely
honest ‚Äì will do nothing but _utterly frustrate_ anyone trying to
capture the truest digital audio possible.

https://youtube.com/watch?v=GhAknEKy9Ig

As part of my https://github.com/extratone/bilge/issues/45[iPhone 12 Pro
Max Review], I‚Äôve accumulated quite a few audio files in various formats
testing its capture abilities and stashed them in
https://github.com/extratone/bilge/tree/main/audio/Capture%20Testing[this
folder] on _The Psalms_‚Äô GitHub Repository. Probably the most relevant
of these, though, is embedded just above. If you‚Äôll forgive my pajamas,
ridiculous piano faces, and general rustiness with the instrument, it
demonstrates the ‚Äú*Audio Zoom*‚Äù feature found in the iPhone 11 Pro and
up, which I‚Äôve found to be unfortunately underdocumented by Apple,
itself. I added my own inquiry to
https://developer.apple.com/forums/thread/124512?answerId=671299022#671299022[this
post on the official Developer forums] asking about it, but don‚Äôt really
expect anything back. According to
‚Äúhttps://www.dxomark.com/what-is-audio-zoom-for-smartphones/[What is
Audio Zoom for smartphones]?‚Äù published on the site _DxOMark_:

____
The main technology behind audio zoom is called beamforming, or spatial
filtering. It allows changing an audio recording‚Äôs directivity (that is,
the sensitivity according to the direction of the sound source) and
shape it in any way necessary. In this case, the optimal directivity is
a hypercardioid pattern (see illustration below), which enhances sounds
coming from the front direction ‚Äî that is, from the direction in which
your camera is pointed ‚Äî while attenuating sounds from all other
directions (your background noise).
____

My testing has suggested that *the best means of recording
unfiltered-as-possible stereo audio with an iPhone is to record video at
1x zoom with the native Camera app* and extract the audio from the video
file. In the https://davidblue.bandcamp.com/track/-[Bandcamp track
embedded below], I ‚Äúmounted‚Äù my 12 Pro Max right above my old upright‚Äôs
soundboard and extracted audio directly from the video file with
Audacity. It was then amplified slightly, saved to a FLAC file and
uploaded directly to Bandcamp. Of course, it‚Äôs worth qualifying that ‚Äì
while I have extensive experience with audio ‚Äì I have neither
professional training, nor any professional monitoring equipment.

https://davidblue.bandcamp.com/track/-

That said, the biggest objection I‚Äôve heard from audiophiles regarding
audio capture and manipulation on handsets, generally, has to do with
their hardware‚Äôs extremely limited capabilities when compared to any
sort of professional desktop soundcard. Given the greater argument I've
come to regarding the state of consumer tech as best exemplified by
smartphone design ‚Äì that we've come to expect _far_ too much of single
devices, and the resulting jack-of-all-tradeness summing their real-life
capabilities has become a *severe detriment* instead of a feature ‚Äì I
must echo, again, that adding ‚Äústudio‚Äù audio capture, manipulation, and
production capabilities to our _goddamned cellular phones_ doesn't help
anyone. To any user truly hoping to accomplish these things, I say _just
go home_ and boot up your damned desktop.

=== Other Considerations

The final episode in _AppStories_' three-part miniseries on music was
https://appstories.net/episodes/214/[just published today], though I
suspect ‚Äì for my audience, anyway ‚Äì that its coverage is mostly
out-of-scope on this topic, largely for financial reasons. Apple's first
event of the year is https://youtu.be/JdBYVNuky1M[scheduled for tomorrow
at noon], my time, and is entitled ‚ÄúSpring Loaded,‚Äù which ‚Äì combined
with its 4/20 joke date ‚Äì suggests to me that we'll finally see the
release of the APPLE GUN‚Ñ¢ alongside iWeed‚Ñ¢, but little to nothing in the
way of music.

In the midst of my brief research into _The Greater History of Apple
Music_, I discovered
https://thenextweb.com/news/apple-shuttering-failed-social-music-network-ping-september-30th[the
existence of iTunes Ping] ‚Äì which I somehow missed entirely,
https://twitter.com/mrjaydeeem/status/1379305438454423559[along with my
Twitter friend Jon Male]. I also discovered articles from the company's
decision to
https://thenextweb.com/news/apple-music-is-dropping-its-connect-social-features[kill
its successor ‚ÄúConnect‚Äù from Apple Music], which was reportedly
‚Äúhttps://www.theverge.com/2018/12/13/18139837/apple-music-connect-social-network-feature-discontinued[rarely
used].‚Äù Notably, this removal also
https://9to5mac.com/2018/12/13/apple-music-connect-ping/[took away] what
little power Artists had over the narrative surrounding their music on
the service. I can see the business justification for all of this
(barely) _except_ for removing the ability for users to follow artists.

The latest Apple Music feature ‚Äì

‚Äúchannel‚Äù for music videos] ‚Äì also makes zero sense to me, but
https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/5/20851576/apple-music-web-player-interface-beta-browser-streaming[the
launch of Apple Music on the web] _absolutely_ does, especially for
Windows and Linux users, who are now _officially_ freed from iTunes (the
software) and allowed to use a much more modern Apple Music experience.
I prepended ‚Äúofficially,‚Äù there, because third-party Apple Music web
players have existed as long as the service has allowed the required
integration. First, there was
https://www.macrumors.com/2018/12/13/apple-music-unofficial-web-player/[Naveed
Golafshani's] ‚Äì which is
https://github.com/naveedgol/music-web-player[no longer live] ‚Äì but
Brychan Bennett-Odlum's
https://www.macrumors.com/2019/01/21/apple-music-web-player-musish/[*Musish*]
is still https://musi.sh/[live and working], as you can see from the
screenshot embedded above. Other than the ability to select between two
stream bitrates, I can't seen any remaining advantages to using the
latter over Apple's own web player, unless you harbor spite toward their
handling of the whole thing, which would be entirely understandable,
from my perspective.

https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/1359364473253937153

As someone who grew up in the mp3 era with a
https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/1359364473253937153[first-generation
iPod Shuffle] and iTunes, living and dying between iTunes Store gift
cards, Apple Music still seems like one hell of a magical deal. In
effect, it allows access to _all of iTunes_ for a flat monthly fee. Or
at least it _would_ had I never become acquainted with professional
independent musicians who've published, there, and have to contend with
tedious realities like
https://artists.apple.com/support/675-send-your-lyrics-to-apple-music[the
process by which one can add those beautiful lyrics to Apple Music
tracks], and who's only real means of control/engagement on the service
has been removed with virtually zero prospects of a replacement. If,
indeed, Jessica Lessin was correct about Apple's obsession with music,
it has resulted in very little for any class of music makers, and left
even its listeners to seek out and find third-party solutions like
MusicHarbor to perform even the most basic personalization one expects
from a modern music streaming service without even bothering to amend
their App Store's discovery process to illuminate them, or even write a
fucking App Story. Despite this, one-to-three-person app teams continue
to work on new solutions, to these and other problems...

[[section0105.xhtml#the-first-release-version-of-my-only-original-contribution-to-the-ios-community-is-now-ready-to-assist-when-you-can-t-find-your-phone]]
=== The first release version of my only original contribution to the iOS community is now ready to assist when you can't find your phone.

One of the handful of Siri's most useful features has been the ‚ÄúHey
Siri! Where are you?‚Äù command, to which Siri will respond ‚ÄúI'm here‚Äù or
‚Äúhere I am!‚Äù Were it possible to view how many times one has triggered a
particular Siri command on iOS, my personal reliance on it would almost
certainly be embarrassing. Often, my handset isn't even obscured from
view ‚Äì it's just faster to have Siri speak up than it is to scan the
room. Occasionally, however, my device has managed to become embedded
beneath and/or within some genuinely-perplexing series of couch
cushions/blankets/briefcase pockets/etc. which require a more constant
homing sort of audio reproduction. Asking friends/family to call one's
phone is the general goto, yes, but honestly the actual length of time
cellular telephones will ring before sending a caller to voicemail in
2021 is _ridiculously_ short, especially when rummaging through
Gourd-knows-what. For that matter, most of my peers keep their phones on
silent mode, 24/7. What then?

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3evgnSlnkjk

Since https://bilge.world/siri-shortcuts-ios12-review[the very first
time] I set eyes upon Siri Shortcuts in iOS 12 Beta, I have wanted to
create one to address this issue in a creative, entertaining, and
(hopefully) genuinely-useful way. On that day almost three years ago, I
even knew it would be called _Marco!_, believe it or not. In the past
few months, I've returned to the project on and off and ended up with
several different versions of varying complexity. One day, I'd like to
figure out how to integrate the full extent of my ideas for Marco! into
a Shortcut which can be reliably triggered when one's device is locked,
but for this first release version, I have included only what I and a
few other (much appreciated) volunteers were able to trigger in every
situation we could conceive of.

Marco! Version 1.0 can be downloaded on
https://routinehub.co/shortcut/8987/[*RoutineHub*] (which I would highly
recommend,) or directly via
https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/cec781677c5648f2a8982213700938b4[*this
iCloud share link*]. I know it's a bit excessive, but I even created a
https://github.com/extratone/marco[GitHub Repository] just for this
Shortcut, seeing as it is undoubtedly the most original I will ever
contribute, and the singular one with potential for continued
development.

Download Marco! as is and (as long as you don't rename it) use ‚ÄúHey
Siri!... Marco!‚Äù This should immediately run the Shortcut, which
includes my voice saying ‚ÄúPolo! Bitch!‚Äù followed by five repeats of the
flashlight/noise cycle as described in detail below.

image:xhtml/https:/i.snap.as/9Ow1cbmz.png[Marco! JellyCuts Steps]

As documented by the
https://github.com/extratone/marco/blob/main/docs/Marco!.html[Jellycuts
file] above, Version 1.0 of Marco!'s actions are as follows:

. Turn Low Power Mode OFF
. Turn Airplane Mode OFF
. Turn Wi-Fi On
. Turn Bluetooth On
. Set brightness to 100%
. Turn Do Not Disturb OFF
. Turn appearance Light
. Set playback destination to iPhone
. Set volume to 89%
. Vibrate device (Not currently working.)
. Play *my voice* saying ‚ÄúPolo!‚Äù + a few other items
. Toggle (flash) the flashlight 5 times (odd number leaving your
flashlight on constantly unless it was on before the Shortcut was
triggered)
. Simultaneously (in the same repeat action) plays three separate
classic Mac sounds 5 times.

The most clever bit about this particular Shortcut is its use of Base64
text to include audio playback. I just fixed a bug on
https://routinehub.co/shortcut/8914/[my own Base64 audio encoder
Shortcut] if you'd like to try it out. Since this version includes my
own voice (subject to taste, I realize,) as well as some minor
profanity, I do intend to publish a clean variation at some point in the
future. If this is an obstacle for you, and/or if you'd like a custom
version made with audio of your own choosing, please do
mailto:davidblue@extratone.com[send me an email]! I would be more than
happy to make one for you.

=== A commitment to share my thoughts where developers actually want them, and an invitation for other reviewers/users to join me.

I have written more than my fair share of words about software, as I
have loved, despised, and been utterly perplexed by it. This year, my
return to the iOS community has perhaps inevitably turned _apps_ into an
addiction of sorts. This particular platform is so utterly chock
full/stocked up of creativity at a scale immeasurably greater and more
accessible than the whole of those throughout computing history,
combined. For someone like myself, it is all too easy to allow oneself
to wander down a virtually endless path of intriguing, very
self-indulgent play, especially now that third-party sites like
https://departures.to[Departures.to] have managed to add discoverability
to TestFlight beta distributions, allowing those non-millionaires among
us opportunities to use test releases of applications we would‚Äôve
otherwise had to pay for. This has been exclusively to my benefit ‚Äì I
can only imagine what 15 year-old me would have done with such power.

image:xhtml/https:/i.snap.as/jIYBC6xU.png[Your Ratings and Reviews -
Apple App Store]

In my recent endeavor to focus on making my work more useful to others,
I've reflected on something I've heard from nigh every developer of the
apps I've reviewed: _Ah yes, your blog looks really cool but FOR THE
LOVE OF GOD, PLEASE REVIEW MY FUCKING APP on the FUCKING STORE._ Read:
your commentary is appreciated, but your five stars would almost
certainly more economically beneficial.

As you can see from the image embedded above, I have personally fallen
_very_ behind in doing my part for those apps I've celebrated, here. A
vague intention to _get around to it eventually_ clearly is not working,
so I've decided to give myself a deadline: *August 15th, 2021* ‚Äì
precisely one month from today. By this date, I will have sifted through
my commentary on apps in this setting and adapted the most useful of it
(per app, obviously) into a manner appropriate to appear on an App Store
Page, and *I would like to formally-ish invite other tech writers/app
reviewers to join me*.

https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/1402057069927309318

I'm terrible at community organization, which certainly does not exclude
events, so I very much welcome any feedback you might have, as well as
any collaborative contributions you'd be interested in making. As I see
it, I have a few essential considerations to offer.

First, the page in the screen capture above ‚Äì which can be found in the
App Store App ‚á® Account (your profile picture in the top-right corner) ‚á®
Account Settings (the tapable element at the very top with your profile
picture and information) ‚á® Ratings and Reviews ‚Äì is _broken as hell_,
along with the rest of the Account Settings menu, notably. This is
important because I insist we all complain about it on all available
channels, considering it's been broken for several months, at least.

Second, you should almost certainly use
https://tools.applemediaservices.com/app-store/[*this ‚Äúnew‚Äù dev-facing
tool*] when searching the App Store, considering that it _actually
works_ in a trustable way, unlike the user-facing tool in the app.

https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/1415732070626758663

Since the standard online palette of event organization software are all
so easy to use, these days, I've established event pages for this event
on multiple platforms, linked in the list below, which I will update as
per any suggestions/requests for equivalent pages on other services. Of
course, it's certainly not a requirement that you join/engage with any
of them.

One could could certainly just add the date to their own calendar
(conveniently with
https://drive.google.com/file/d/1WM2esll-Yf5Fg4gO9ZYVAJ0pPrdexGqF/view?usp=sharing[this

be participating. Those interested in further engagement, however, can

Apple's second virtual World Wide Developer Conference came and went as
I wrote this guide ‚Äì you can metaphorically picture me looking up from
my machine having overheard the news of the
https://developer.apple.com/design/awards/[2021 Apple Design Award

voted for, myself:

‚Äì the

service, and
https://apps.apple.com/us/app/craft-docs-and-notes-editor/id1487937127[Craft]
‚Äì perhaps the most innovative take on word processing of the past two or
three years ‚Äì listed under ‚ÄúFinalists.‚Äù (Read: losers.) The most
positive personal discovery of (all?) WWDCs: an app called
https://www.bemyeyes.com/[*Be My Eyes*], which ‚Äúconnects blind and

exceptionally crafted, cross-device accessible-as-fuck TTS solution
called
https://apps.apple.com/us/app/voice-dream-reader/id496177674[Voice Dream

https://apps.apple.com/ph/app/league-of-legends-wild-rift/id1480616990[the
fucking _League of Legends_ game] certainly sours the mouth and suggests
yet further just how much Apple, Inc. has _sold out_.

The continued prioritization of Growth for Growth's sake over any and
all other considerations (namely, users,) is not unexpected from even
the most valuable company in the history of the world, I suppose, but
there _is_ an actor at this point in the story who is catastrophically
and demonstrably failing to fulfill their role: all I really know is
that technology media has fallen into a trough of total uselessness when
it comes to qualitative, authoritative analysis of consumer-targeted
software. The necessity of this guide ‚Äì and the bizarrely silent
ignorance of even the ‚Äúfringes‚Äù on its subject ‚Äì is unimaginably severe.
Before me has been (for years, now,) the ‚Äúanswer‚Äù to a Jolly Big Load of
what tech and marketing types lament in more and more existential
language, yet _hardly any_ of the humans with the most to lose from
their negligence ‚Äì regular, casual social media users ‚Äì have been
delivered to these experiences. The story is not being articulated. *The
journalism is not being done.*

I know you almost certainly did not arrive here to hear one
motherfucker's complaints about WWDC, but ‚Äì as with everything Apple,
Inc. does ‚Äì every morsel of curatorial
expression/discrimination/favoritism from The Great Money God within
this platform _must_ be scrutinized and criticized. Quite frankly, I
found myself completely at a loss as to how _not_ to dwell on the
Discovery Disparity, here.

Despite how deeply I've gone into iOS this year, I do not believe myself
to be a qualified judge of software design, but I no longer believe
Apple to be, either. Regardless of the revenue-related controversies of
late, Apple have simply become terrible stewards of the App Store in
every imaginable sense. Scams and blatant intellectual property theft
abound, while the majority of the most innovative entries I've ever seen
remain entirely obfuscated and uncelebrated by all of Apple. Inc.'s
mechanisms. If you required an explanation for the amount of time I've
invested into App Guides ‚Äì a space to which I never would have imagined
intentionally bringing _The Psalms_ ‚Äì I hope you can understand.

I must confess: I have been _meaning_ to write this app guide since even
before I https://bilge.world/eugen-rochko-interview[interviewed Mastodon
creator Eugen Rochko] on the morning of his Big Press Day, just over 4
years ago. I‚Äôve exhaustively explored different means of convincing my
own longtime Twitter friends to move, over that time, with very little
success. Eugen, himself, published an
https://blog.joinmastodon.org/2021/02/developing-an-official-ios-app-for-mastodon/[official
blog post] at the beginning of February detailing his plans to open up
onboarding by way of ‚Äúan official Mastodon app that is free to download
and that is specialized in helping new users get started on the
platform.‚Äù As a Patreon supporter of
https://www.patreon.com/mastodon[The Mastodon Project] (full
disclosure,) I've been testing this app (see preview shots at the very
end,) and am quite smitten with it. That said, I thought it might be
worth going over the third-party options iOS users currently have
available to them, largely because the offerings are each innovative and
mature applications in their own right. (Also, it‚Äôs become quite
apparent that the normal tech media sources you‚Äôd go to for such a guide
aren‚Äôt going to give Mastodon the attention it deserves.)

image:xhtml/https:/i.snap.as/Y624NGHM.jpg[Masto Mascot iOS Art]

[[section0107.xhtml#obligatory-context]]
=== Obligatory(?) Context

I originally intended to be as clinical as possible in this Post, having
realized its potential as the singular comparison of its kind to appear
in search results for new and potential users of Mastodon. From my
perspective, Mastodon has long since surpassed regard as a novel social
media experiment who's function is to prompt academic conversations
about decentralization, open source, ad tech, and federated social's
solutions to all of the Big Web's Big Boy (proprietary) Problems (though
I have been compelled to https://github.com/extratone/bigblue[invest
significantly] in that very conversation.) In the less intellectual
hours of my day-to-day life (read: most of the time,) Mastodon is
nothing more or less than my favorite place on the internet. It is a
relentless delight which I only lament because I want to share so much
of it with my friends, but have continued to fail in my efforts to
articulate that *Mastodon is not a compromise; it is a better social
space*.

If you didn't know, this seems to have become _my general shit_, for
lack of a better term: the ethical considerations of open
source/‚Äúalternative‚Äù software are very important, yes! ... but they are
_far_ from the whole, and they are not a requisite for new users. The
second of https://bilge.world/about[this World Wide Web Blog's
fundamental considerations], in fact:

____
The Open Source/Open Web community continues to struggle with their
_brand image_ (if you will) in both old and new ways that needlessly
alienate (and sometimes obfuscate) some of their most important
contributions from the average user. *Technology media has failed in
their responsibility to address this issue.*
____

The blog on which you're reading this, in fact, is federated on
https://activitypub.rocks/[ActivityPub]. If you so chose, you could be
reading it in any client capable of displaying large bodies of text. The
crucial point, though, is that _you didn't need to know that_ ‚Äì you
could very well go on reading it on the web in total ignorance/apathy
regarding Federation.

_Oh boy, here we go..._ No. I did not want to say anything ideological ‚Äì
I wanted this Post to function as little more than a pretty screenshot
showcase and simple associative list responding to all of the Reddit
posts I've seen to the tune of ‚Äúis there an iPhone app?‚Äù As I explored
them, however, I was reminded of the sheer creativity the ‚Äúalternative‚Äù
software community is capable of. Even the roughest of these considered
apps seem unable to be faceless ‚Äì sorting through the obscene amount of
(unlabeled) screenshots accumulated over the past weeks of testing in my
Recents folder has been _so_ much easier than I thought it would be
because of their relentless originality. If you've actually used any iOS
applications and/or browsed the singular App Store from which they can
be acquired in the past 3-4 years, you're undoubtedly skeptical: what we
might have called ‚Äúfeature overlap‚Äù at one time has become all but the
platform's core ethos. If you're the sort who enjoys screwing around
with apps, generally, as I have for the whole of iPhone history, you
have grown accustomed to disappointment.

https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/1402057069927309318

Regardless of who is to blame, we can all agree that the App Store is
currently oversaturated nigh _beyond usability_ with mediocre entries
built from the beginning with zero apparent ambition toward original
function. This, alone, wouldn't be so problematic if Discovery were not
so https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/1379068906917224448[completely
and totally Fucked] (except when
https://tools.applemediaservices.com/app-store/[dev-facing],) but I
needn't comment further on that subject at the moment ‚Äì I'm just trying
emphasize how absolutely unheard of it is for a single
protocol/service's third-party client representation on iOS to be so
thoroughly special. It was astonishing to find all but one or two of
these apps _in a functional state_, actually. In all my equivalent
experiences downloading the entirety of a given service's API-supported
palette (e.g. IRC apps,
https://www.vice.com/en/article/pkbgvg/major-internet-projects-are-leaving-freenode-after-korean-prince-takeover[topically],)
an all-too-significant purpose of whatever ends up getting published is
simply documenting the ~20% of available titles that _actually work_ at
the given moment. (I'd have mentioned the ‚Äúbest [service/task] iPhone
apps for [year]‚Äù listicles found in online publications like _Digital
Trends_ were it not for the percentage of them in which it's clear the
author _did not actually download_ some/most of the apps listed‚ÄΩ‚ÄΩ‚ÄΩ)
Perhaps due to
https://www.wsj.com/video/series/joanna-stern-personal-technology/apple-software-chief-explains-ios-145-defends-companys-reach-exclusive/57D138E3-3677-4A78-9534-62DAD443FE97[iOS
14.5's implementation of ATT], all of the Mastodon apps I could find and
test (not counting non-English language-supporting apps, in fairness'
interest) are currently functioning.

So, if there's virtually zero chance a new Mastodon user might download
one of the apps we're about to consider and find it broken, what
practical function remains for this guide? Hopefully, to establish a SEO
catch-all for such users from a non-automated source less associated
with the project than the official apps list. Those for whom Mastodon is
still an unfamiliar subject should find the collected imagery
intriguing, hopefully.

Pragmatic Code's
https://apps.apple.com/us/app/linky-for-twitter-and-mastodon/id438090426[Linky]
was also mentioned by multiple respondents. It's not a client, but a
bridging tool for smoother URL sharing that integrates with iOS' share
sheet. I did not have time to try it, myself, but from all accounts, it
is an obligatory mention. So too is the
https://github.com/extratone/FediiOS[*GitHub Repository/List*] I created
in order to ‚Äúformally‚Äù offer a list with much greater brevity and zero
editorialization.

First, let‚Äôs begin with The Big 6 ‚Äì those apps The Mastodon Project,
itself, has seen fit to https://joinmastodon.org/apps[list on
joinmastodon.org].

Dag √Ögren‚Äòs https://apps.apple.com/us/app/toot/id1229021451[Toot!] is
not only my personal app of choice ‚Äì I would (and have) go so far as to
say it‚Äôs the single most innovative mobile social app I‚Äôve ever
encountered, largely because of its jacknife-esque instance selection.
It‚Äôs held a place in my phone‚Äôs dock since the day I first downloaded
it, for this and many other reasons. While one might find bugs/loose
ends (understandably) exploring the functions of other indie social
clients, within Toot!, they will only find little delights, like
https://imgur.com/gallery/xAXs95J[its wholly unique Share Sheet
interface].

image:xhtml/https:/i.snap.as/bXG5SAUv.png[Toot! Themes]

Toot! is extremely beautiful (despite its unfortunate name,) and I am
quite superficial in my taste. It‚Äôs Obsidian theme (which may or may not
be related to the topical notetaking system of the same name) is
especially gorgeous.

In my https://mastodon.social/@DavidBlue/106302686196643266[cacophonous
attempt] to compare the notifications of all available Mastodon apps
simultaneously, it's worth noting that Toot!'s always came first. Its
https://whyp.it/t/toot-ios-app-custom-sounds-92997[charming custom audio
alerts] also make them my favorite by far.

They're not just cute: in reflection informed by a newly-considered
function of these apps ‚Äì serving as representing the network as a whole
‚Äì it occurred to me that *Toot! audio alerts playing from my iPhone have
prompted more first-time conversations about Mastodon in the wild than I
can count*. (Seriously: they should be considered an onboarding
mechanism.)

image:xhtml/https:/i.snap.as/30YJR456.png[Toot! Settings]

In my experience, it‚Äôs also the most robust of the lot ‚Äì as in, it is
very much the exception rather than the norm to encounter any sort of
error or other obstruction in normal, day-to-day use. My own real
reservation applies to the entire selection discussed today: I wish
Toot! supported Bluetooth keyboard shortcuts.

https://github.com/ReticentJohn/Amaroq/commit/9648ebdecf8ab20819ba10fe18b6317a8026fd86[first
commit] dates back to April 17th, 2017. While you‚Äôre there, you might
note that it‚Äôs the only one of these entries coded entirely in
Objective-C ‚Äì the near-40-year-old language originally underpinning iOS
before Swift‚Äôs birth in 2014. Amaroq was the first Mastodon app I used
and remains the strongest free option for iOS users. It‚Äôs been nearly a
year since its last update, so its missing a few narrower functions like
Bookmarking and Polls, but the core features it _does_ include are rock
solid. The only wild card: what the fuck is Awoo Mode???

Unfortunately, the state of Mercury's App Store reviews prompt yet
another essential economic/editorial consideration. The one in the very
center of the image embedded, above ‚Äì from ‚ÄúFeralDandelion‚Äù ‚Äì is the
singular one I will allow myself to address. It is true that Mercury
straight up refuses to authenticate or federate with a substantial
amount of specific Mastodon servers, but it is *exhaustively explicit
about this from very get-go*. Its https://onmercury.app/help[single-page
Help document] includes a detailed, up-to-date table of every single
blocked instance and _the specific justification_ for each respective
instance's presence on it:

____
Mercury takes a zero tolerance stance on abuse and harassment and as
such does not support many instances that promote abuse and harassment.
____

Let me be clear: the practical manifestation of this position is
*exclusively positive*. The Mastodon project has long outgrown the sort
of fixation on ideology for ideology's sake that even Lucky Linus
himself has no patience for. Instead, _thank Gourd_ Mercury's developers
took the time to better your social experience! In response to
statements like the pullquote above, I expect **only* thumbs in the air*
from this point, forward.

seems inextricably linked with Metatext. I vaguely understand what it
means, and I do agree, but it's worth noting that I speak with some
privilege, having compared all of these apps on the top performing
handset Apple currently has to offer. In many ways, it is the most
frugal of the new offerings, especially, yet it strikes a keen balance
between function and delight. I think ‚Äúnative‚Äù can be translated as
_generally of a stout, sturdy disposition_, thanks to the care put into

I'm not entirely positive which Mastodon app was _actually_ the first on
my iPhone, back in 2017, but I know for sure it was either Amaroq or the
dearest, infinitely-colorful Tootle. Its
https://mastodon.cloud/@tootleapp[App Store Page] Version History
suggests it has not been updated in 14 months, yet the app ‚Äì which was
apparently ‚ÄúDesigned for iPad‚Äù ‚Äì appears to be working just fine. There
are some overlapping UI elements, but they're barely noticeable. Were it
not for the new dev-facing store search tool mentioned above, I would
have assumed this app long gone, to be honest, but using it again has
somehow managed to genuinely twinge my nostalgia nerve.

In my search for any extra-App Store representation other than
https://mastodon.cloud/@tootleapp[Tootle's Mastodon Account] (which last
posted the day after my birthday, last year,) I discovered
https://ubuntuhandbook.org/index.php/2020/11/tootle-l-gtk3-mastodon-client-linux/[Tootle...
for Linux]. Since I am a dedicated and thorough person, these days, I
spent several hours messing around with Linux Virtual Machining until
Lubuntu finally functioned _just_ so I could show you what it looks
like. Below is a screen capture of Tootle bordered by the most Macish
LXQ desktop bars included in Lubuntu and _even_ wearing the new official
Apple System Font, SF Pro. Still, I think you'll agree... Tootle for
Linux is not related to Tootle.

Personally, I find this a profound shame ‚Äì I think more apps should be
as colorful ‚Äì and as color _configurable_ ‚Äì as this little, mysterious
Mastodon app. I created the theme you see represented in the frames
embedded above using _The Psalms_ colors, naturally, and the whole
process took less than five minutes. Play around with it as I remember
doing, all those years ago, and you'd be surprised how hard it is to
create an unusable color theme. What I find _most_ shame in, though, is
that Tootle appears to be completely invisible in regular app store
searches, now. (And by ‚Äú_most_ shame,‚Äù you know I really mean _entirely

are especially high, indeed.

Tusker's color customization options are technically... well.. _not
infinite_, like other apps here, but the end result of their (obviously,
very considered) selection will be a net win for 100% of users over that
alternative, I believe. It is definitely of a similar philosophy to
Metatext, but unquestionably more ambitious. Out of the lot, testing

Installing Roma for the first time led to a puzzling quest with a
particularly pleasant end. I noticed fairly quickly that the iOS app was
a re-branded release of what used to be Mast. My first instinct upon
this discovery was to DM Mast's original developer,
https://twitter.com/JPEGuin[Shihab Meboob], on Twitter, but frankly,
I've already bothered him enough there over the years, so it's
understandable that I didn't hear back. When I downloaded the desktop
app I found on https://www.roma.rocks/#desktop[Roma's web page] and
noticed its similarity to
https://whalebird.social/en/desktop/contents[Whalebird], I decided to
use the site's contact form to
https://github.com/extratone/bilge/blob/main/correspondence/Roma%20Inquiry.md[inquire]
about what exactly was going on as gingerly as I could. Happily, I
received a reply just _minutes_ later from Leo Radvinsky, head of
https://leo.com/[Leo.com], ‚Äúa Florida-based boutique venture capital
fund that invests in technology companies:‚Äù

____
Hi David,

In both cases we funded the original developers of both Mast and
Whalebird to create a branded whitelabel app specially made for Pleroma.
The idea was to make Roma a cross platform brand/app. It didn't really
work out so now we're working on a new app from scratch called Fedi for
iOS and Android and releasing that as open source.

https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?gl=US&hl=en_US&id=com.fediverse.app[https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.fediverse.app&hl=en_US&gl=US]

https://apps.apple.com/in/app/fedi-for-pleroma-and-mastodon/id1478806281

I think Roma has been removed from the app stores as it's no longer
supported.

Let me know if you have any other questions
____

Though my hopes for the original Mast to live on in Roma form were more
or less dashed by this message, the suggestion that someone is investing
*actual capital* into federated social is certainly worth celebrating.
If Roma is still available on the App Store as you're reading this, I
insist you download it immediately. It represents an incredible and
original attention to detail which should not simply be forgotten.

Naturally, the app inheriting the work/resources established by Mast and
Roma ‚Äì known by _Fedi_ ‚Äì should be next up for discussion. Hopefully, my
relative lack of experience with https://pleroma.social/[Pleroma] ‚Äì
another ActivityPub-based, federated social network ‚Äì won't let you
down, here. After a brief shock from the uniqueness of Fedi's UI passes,
one immediately notices how beautifully it is animated, wholly
disregarding my
https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/1357394407201398791[recently-acquired]
preference for as little animation as possible. Perhaps more than any
other app discussed here, Fedi feels uncannily bespoke in a way which
iOS apps almost never do. It is undoubtedly the result of a very
specific vision ‚Äì to disregard the whole modern template for social apps
and completely reimagine the archetype. Personally, I'm not sure if it
would be easy to get used to, but my tastes/habits in this regard are
very much the result of the past decade of proprietary social apps'
blandness. Going forward with substantial financial backing and the
talents of whoever it was that got it this far, no doubt we should all
have very high hopes for Fedi.

Yet another ‚ÄúDesigned for iPad‚Äù entry, Naoki Kuwata's
https://apps.apple.com/us/app/tootoise/id1465090190[Tootoise] is defined
by its custom incoming post rate accommodations and its gorgeous
Solarized theme. Its ‚ÄúMax number of new arrival posts‚Äù setting ranges
from 0-400, allowing one to freeze their timeline entirely from any
accidental (or habitual) Pulls to Refresh (set at 0,) load 400 Toots
from such a gesture, or anything in between (at 40-Toot increments,
anyway.) The advantages of this specification become immediately
apparent when one actually begins to explore it, especially for those
who have come to Mastodon after feeling overwhelmed by Big Social.

Stella is listed as a ‚ÄúMastodon, Twitter & News Client,‚Äù and is notably
one of the two apps on this list which do indeed support Twitter! More
than that, it is the first app I've seen in a very long time that allows
one to _simultaneously_ post to two separate social services (Twitter
and Mastodon, in this case.) Without documentation, it's a bit clunky,
but its customizable timelines feature also allows one to combine
multiple ‚Äúsources‚Äù (social accounts) into a single timeline.

‚ÄúAnywhere Software.‚Äù The GitHub icon in its footer led me to discover
https://github.com/AnywhereSoftware/B4X-Pleroma[a repository] which is
labeled as such to lead one to believe it is, indeed, the development
space for the iOS app we're discussing, but does not contain a single
.swift or .pbxproj file ‚Äì universally essential for iOS apps, as I
understand it. Regardless, B4X appears to be built atop Anywhere

that in the best possible sense. While it‚Äôs probably the least polished
of the lot ‚Äì and therefore likely the least viable candidate for the
role of your primary, daily-driven Mastodon client ‚Äì is is far from a
throwaway application. Some evil component of Takeyasu‚Äôs mind was
clearly let loose if only for a moment, for Oyakodon‚Äôs Facebook-style
theme is reminiscent enough of Big Blue to alarm. The volume of its
design definitely peaks in its Cute theme, which is so violently loud I
could not help but extract its color palette to illustrate just how
furious its creator must have been.

I very vaguely remember happening upon StarPterano in my very first
moments on Mastodon, so finding it still published on the App Store ‚Äì
buried as it was ‚Äì brought me a particular sort of joy. If I‚Äôm not
mistaken, it holds a special personal accolade as the only iOS app which
has caused me to involuntarily shriek. This might sound like an insult,
but it is actually the peak of my praise. I believe my knowledge of iOS
development safely allows me to suppose that StarPterano was built with
complete disregard for any established UI element libraries. That is,
the familiar toggles and buttons developers rely on to standardize the
iOS experience were cast aside entirely in favor of handbuilt,
translucent buttons of a sort of neon quality which call menus and text
entry fields no less alien to the platform. The most astonishing bit,
though, is that it _works_. On my 12 Pro Max, it‚Äôs exceptionally smooth,
in fact.

I would imagine those _real_ iOS developers among you should find
https://github.com/pgostation/StarPterano-iOS5[StarPterano‚Äôs GitHub
Repository] particularly interesting, considering. In the interest of
preservation, I have
https://github.com/softwarehistorysociety/StarPterano[forked it] as
well, and fully intend to dive in to its code, one of these days. The
audio player embedded above cites a three-second .mp3 file in the
repository which perhaps once accounted for the ‚ÄúSounds‚Äù toggle still
found in the Settings menu of StarPterano‚Äôs current build. I couldn‚Äôt
get the app to reproduce it, which is actually what set me on the hunt
that led to the repo.

Stella, it's the second of the first two apps I've come across in a very

Considerable work was obviously done on making its timeline-based tabs
switchable with touch. Personally, I very much prefer my current

https://qz.com/1726194/the-decline-of-douban-an-online-sanctuary-for-chinas-liberals/[a
single _Quartz_ article] from October 2019. He eludes to a ‚Äúboom‚Äù of
Mastodon adoption in the past few years and cites a lack of ‚Äúuser
friendly mobile clients‚Äù which I can only assume to be a conundrum
specific to China.

‚ÄúWith the aim of contributing to the community and to this movement, I
decided to take my quarantine time to build an enjoyable mobile client
for Douban Refugees,‚Äù he explains. He notes that decentralized platforms
have universally rejected algorithmic recommendation if for any other
reason than ‚Äúwithout centralized computing power, such [a]
recommendation service is also not that feasible.‚Äù ‚ÄúAdapting‚Äù back to a
linear timeline in a manner which still encourages exploration was
clearly a major design consideration for tooot.

=== Get Bent, Big Social

A few universal truths among these apps stand out as obligatory
mentions. First ‚Äì in comparison with their Proprietary, Big Social
counterparts ‚Äì they are all _ridiculously_ *frugal*. Not a one weighs
over 40mb, while minor (unexplained) updates to the official Twitter app
https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/1393294957352468494[often exceed
100mb]. They are all astonishingly *robust* ‚Äì I did not experience a
single crash in the course of normal testing these ‚Äúalt‚Äù social apps-
even from the beta builds ‚Äì while I distinctly remember the official
Twitter app crashing several times over this period, even after I
deleted and reinstalled it (an accepted maintenance requirement for
anyone using it heavily for its entire history.) Also, on the topic of
the platform, itself, they are also made absurdly *interoperable* by the
ActivityPub standard. My https://pixelfed.social/DavidBlue[PixelFed]
posts show up seamlessly on their timelines among content from
https://diasp.org/[Diaspora], https://pleroma.social/[Pleroma], and
Mastodon, itself.

https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/1393294957352468494

The overwhelming impression I was left with after testing these apps was
one of unwavering competence, cleverness, and true innovation. How many
different ways can I possibly conjure forth in order to communicate
this? I, David Blue ‚Äì the vain fucker with a precollection for the most
superficial variables of software design _so_ healthy that I have on
multiple occasions designed whole, years-long workflows around specific
applications _entirely because of their available color palettes_... *It
is I who requires you to take a good fucking look*, because this list of
decentralized, largely open source, federated social software is a
goddamned fashion show.

image:xhtml/https:/user-images.githubusercontent.com/43663476/122717470-43f08a00-d231-11eb-890f-dfa3ff33b65d.png[Mastodon
Account Wordcloud]

This couldn't be ‚Äújust‚Äù an app guide ‚Äì I think I have thoroughly
accepted this, by now, just in time for some conclusionary remarks.
Somehow, the subject I originally tackled specifically because I thought
it would be quick, rudimentary, and straightforward has become yet
another personal journey. It'd feel a bit preposterous to declare any
one of these apps to be _life-changing_, but ‚Äì in every sense of the
term, in contemporary, inevitably social media-informed life, they do
indeed constitute a form of radical, ideological wellness. Each of them
managed to remind me of a different minute delight found within a
developer-user dynamic made up of thoughtful and effective minds working
to contribute original and valuable experiences, first. Most noteworthy
of these little freedoms: the realization that the upcoming ‚Äúofficial‚Äù
Mastodon app along with any future new options are exclusively a
positive thing _for the user_... None of these apps were conceived to
gobble up market share because the market is fundamentally, inevitably,
uncompromisingly _infinitely shared_. I don't know anything about
business, but I _do_ know that relief from the burden of considering
proprietary multivectored development intentions has been personally
breathtaking. I can only hope the reciprocal compensation is happening
at even a fraction of what it ‚Äúshould‚Äù be.

From another essential direction, I hope I have communicated that
they're far from curious, ‚Äúniche‚Äù or vanity side projects, now. When I
used the term ‚Äúmature‚Äù in introducing this little arena, I very much
meant it ‚Äì these ‚Äúalt‚Äù social clients developed almost exclusively
within single-person-led projects now make the Twitter for iOS app look
ugly _and_ fucking broken. ‚ÄúGiving social networking back to you‚Äù has
never been more resonant. Yes, it really is Toot!'s ‚Äútake a break‚Äù blue
screen, Amaroq's mysterious Awoo mode toggle, iMast's music app
integration, Mercury's configurable timelines, Metatext's native
solidity, Tootle's custom colors, Tusker's Digital Wellness controls,
DUDU's elemental readability, Roma's quiet resurrection of Mast's UI
bravado, Stella's utterly bizarre visual departures, Fedi's odd animated
UI behaviors, Tootoise's consideration of _pace_, B4X's unfathomable
elements, Ore2's parallel timelines, tooot's development story, and
Oyakodon's adorable rough edges that have made my online life
_measurably_... _immensely_ better, these past weeks. At the forefront
of this perception is undoubtedly the comparatively extensive _control_
over my social experience as a user offered by the diversity of mobile
experiences these applications offer.

Those of you who haven't yet signed up for Mastodon: ==you are missing
the fuck out==. I am being _actually_ pampered, now, in World Wide Web
terms. You are https://bit.ly/dbmastodon[_so_ welcome] whenever you're
ready ‚Äì the water is nice and warm, as they say.

Yes, you are looking at the currently in-development *‚Äú_Official_‚Äù
Mastodon app on iOS*, coming very soon to the Awful App Store. You can
join me in testing the app right this very moment by contributing to
https://www.patreon.com/mastodon[the Mastodon Project's Patreon]. Though
I do plan to publish https://bilge.world/mastodon-ios-app-review[*a
dedicated review*] on its release date, what I'll say for now is that
it's very cute, includes _the_ most gorgeous media player I've ever seen
on an iOS app, and is as distinctly clever as any of the third-party
family we've just visited, all whilst maintaining an expert's aim at its
evangelist purpose.

The surprise that threw me over the edge to a genuinely pitiful extent:
the official Mastodon app already includes full *Bluetooth keyboard
shortcuts integration on iPhone!*

Indeed,
*https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mastodon-for-iphone/id1571998974[it is
here]*. Essentially, Mastodon Commander-in-Chief Eugen Rochko and his
team developed a whole, exceptional iOS app in the span of time it took
me to write the https://bilge.world/mastodon-ios-apps[third-party
Mastodon iOS app showcase] just before this item in _The Psalms_‚Äô feed.
If you‚Äôre new to this conversation, perhaps it‚Äôd be best to start in
February of this year, with
https://blog.joinmastodon.org/2021/02/developing-an-official-ios-app-for-mastodon/[Eugen‚Äôs
announcement of the ‚Äúofficial‚Äù Mastodon app‚Äôs development] on the
official Mastodon blog. ‚ÄúWe need an official Mastodon app that is free
to download and that is specialized in helping new users get started on
the platform,‚Äù argues Eugen, in response to feedback indicating ‚Äúthe
lack of an app that carries [Mastodon‚Äôs] name in the app stores trips up
newcomers.‚Äù My first thought regarding the idea of an app _Specialized_
in onboarding cynically jumped to the assumption that such a design
choice would result in a less-than-ideal experience for those of us who
already call Mastodon our home. However, as a
https://patreon.com/mastodon[Patreon] supporter of the Mastodon Project,
I‚Äôve had the privilege of testing the final result for the past five
weeks, and I can tell ya‚Ä¶ It is so much more than that.

https://youtube.com/watch?v=bD8GQvNrE7E

[[section0108.xhtml#onboarding]]
=== Onboarding

I‚Äôd like to offer the https://youtu.be/bD8GQvNrE7E[demo video] embedded
above as an unusually succinct (from me) demonstration of the
delightfully well-considered onboarding process. I would go so far as to
declare it *the best all-around social network onboarding process
currently available*. Having very recently slugged through the official
Twitter app‚Äôs equivalent, the frames greeting new Mastodon users within
this app are unbelievably exceptional.

image:xhtml/https:/i.snap.as/P5oxTAg9.png[Onboarding in Mastodon for
iOS]

First, we‚Äôre presented with a list of Mastodon instances (servers,)
organized by category. Those friends of mine to whom I‚Äôve failed to
‚Äúsell‚Äù Mastodon have cited server selection as a major obstacle of
confusion and I can‚Äôt imagine a better means of addressing it than the
tool offered by this app. It‚Äôs beautiful and fast in a way previous
utilities ‚Äì like https://instances.social[instances.social] ‚Äì cannot be,
especially for those most lacking in attention. Once we‚Äôve chosen a
server, we are immediately presented up front with a clearly readable
document containing the ‚Äúground rules‚Äù set by its administrators. In my
experience, these rules tend to be notably *easy-to-understand* and *not
open to interpretation*, as if they were written primarily in the
interest of community wellness rather than to construct a defense from
legal action.

After we‚Äôve agreed to the relevant terms of the server we‚Äôve chosen,
it‚Äôs on to account creation, which offers the options to which citizens
of the social web have become accustomed ‚Äì profile picture, username,
email address, and password ‚Äì but notably without the
https://gimletmedia.com/shows/reply-all/n8hxzr7/176-twicarus[inexplicable
errors] exhibited for years in Big Social‚Äôs equivalent functions.
Immediately following this frame, we are prompted to check our inboxes
for a confirmation link. The explanation for my dramatic exclamation in
the demo video comes down to Mastodon for iOS‚Äô implementation of the
operating system's intra-app linking function (with the syntax
`mastodon://`,) which (in my experience) is hardly ever utilized
correctly. The result is that I was able to click the incoming
confirmation link within Outlook for iOS and then proceed _within the
Mastodon app_ instead of being bounced off to a web browser. This
integration should not be remarkable, but ‚Äì in the context of iOS
development as it stands in 2021 ‚Äì it most certainly is.

After confirmation, we are offered the option to explore the app‚Äôs ‚ÄúFind
people to follow‚Äù function, which is informed by ‚Äúa mix of most followed
accounts and most-engaged-with accounts from recent times that post
primarily in your language,‚Äù as
https://mastodon.social/@Gargron/106674282886448440[Eugen explained] in
response to an earlier draft of this post. Indeed, the remarkably
relevant results offered to me in the demo were not actually remarkable
at all: I just know a lot of folks on mastodon.online ‚Äì especially those
who post the most. That's the whole bit! If you need ‚Äúproof,‚Äù
https://mastodon.online/@keys[here is the finished result], but
obviously, I would advise you download the app and try yourself. (It's a
clich√©, yes, but seriously... What do you have to lose?)

image:xhtml/https:/i.snap.as/F21Jm29Q.png[image]

[[section0108.xhtml#advantages]]
=== Advantages

One of the distinctly missing functions among the breadth of third-party
offerings has been the ability to edit one's profile information from
within the app. Mastodon for iOS addresses this in a particularly
visually impressive way (see image embedded above.) Some also have yet
to be updated with support for Polls, which the new app encompasses in a
manner that puts Big Social's equivalents to shame. The ability to
vertically drag individual options in the compose interface, for
instance, reflects insight only gained by _actually using these
features_. The result is definitively the best means of crafting a
Mastodon poll, for what that's worth.

image:xhtml/https:/i.snap.as/NKHk8e1W.png[Polling in Mastodon for iOS]

[[section0108.xhtml#shortcuts]]
==== Shortcuts

As of this writing, Mastodon for iOS also includes Siri Shortcut support
by way of a single action, entitled ‚ÄúPost on Mastodon.‚Äù Mostly in the
interest of demonstration, I have created and published two Shortcuts
around this action on RoutineHub:

. ‚Äú*https://routinehub.co/shortcut/9776/[Mastodon Share]*‚Äù ‚Äì a text-only
Shortcut meant for the Share Sheet.
. ‚Äú*https://routinehub.co/shortcut/9781/[Mastgur]*‚Äù ‚Äì a more complicated
Shortcut utilizing Imgur actions to get around the current Mastodon for
iOS action's lack of multimedia support.

image:xhtml/https:/i.snap.as/H212I22P.png[Siri Shortcuts for Mastodon
for iOS]

Mastodon friend Emma's
https://mstdn.cloud.themaymeow.com/@emma/106656610574981709[customization
of the latter] is a great example of how quickly one can tailor these
(and all other) Siri Shortcuts to their own particular use.

[[section0108.xhtml#challenges]]
=== Challenges

As of this writing, coverage of the app‚Äôs release amounted only to
https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/30/22602275/mastodon-decentralized-social-network-official-ios-app-launches[a
single news item from]
__https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/30/22602275/mastodon-decentralized-social-network-official-ios-app-launches[The
Verge]__https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/30/22602275/mastodon-decentralized-social-network-official-ios-app-launches[‚Äôs
Adi Robinson], which notes the omission of local/federated ‚Äúfirehose‚Äù
timeline views out of a desire to ‚Äúreduce the potential for conflict
with Apple.‚Äù (see: the Inc.‚Äôs
https://litchie.com/2021/07/idos2-will-be-gone[blatantly inconsistent
enforcement] of its store policies in the past few months.) As a
Mastodon user who _does_ occasionally engage with my local and federated
timelines, I find this decision reasonable considering the wellspring of
third-party apps on iOS which _do_ support said views and the app‚Äôs
explicit focus on brand new, fragile users. My personal experience
disagrees with Eugen‚Äôs description of these timelines as a suboptimal
means of capital-D Discovery, however, considering I‚Äôve found ~70-80% of
https://github.com/extratone/bilge/blob/main/curation/mastodonfollowing.csv[the
600+ accounts I follow], there. (Though it should be noted that I _do
not_ represent any majority in my social media-specific preferences or
behavior.)

Though the onboarding process‚Äô people to follow finder is pretty darn
stellar, I worry that our hypothetical new user has a high chance of
landing on a more-or-less empty timeline. (For many, I‚Äôm sure this would
be a welcome relief, at least initially.) A well-limited Local timeline
view, at least, might prove a valuable upcoming addition. Regardless, I
am 100% positive these omissions from the _initial release_ version of
this iOS app do not constitute some new ideological opposition to the
greater concept of Federation.

image:xhtml/https:/i.snap.as/7UTf6Qyx.png[Composition Details in
Mastodon for iOS]

Naturally, a recurring complaint about the app is already surfacing in
hashtag iOS on the Fediverse:
https://mastodon.social/@wiredfire/106672087623244223[no multiple
account support]?! Perhaps you‚Äôve already written me off as a mindless
devotee, but ‚Äì especially after exploring
https://github.com/extratone/FediiOS[the whole breadth of Mastodon apps
available on iOS] (all of which support multiple accounts) ‚Äì the
significance of this omission as a target for gripes seems laughably
minuscule. Considering I have yet to delete any of the 20 apps I tested,
I personally feel _pretty well covered_ when it comes to checking my
(embarrassingly numerous) alt accounts. It‚Äôd be one thing if longtime
users/powerusers were left wanting for available apps designed for us,
but we have a more diverse, quality palette to choose from than any
other social media protocol. To decry this app ‚Äì which was explicitly
designed from the very beginning for new users ‚Äì for skipping a function
offered by _more than a dozen alternatives_ is patently absurd. If
you‚Äôve got multiple accounts you feel the need to check regularly, order
them by frequency, authenticate all but number one in the free,
dependable
https://apps.apple.com/us/app/amaroq-for-mastodon/id1214116200[Amaroq],
and save Mastodon‚Äôs new app for your main.

[[section0108.xhtml#delights]]
=== Delights

The ‚Äúrelentless originality‚Äù I spoke of in my _third-party_ showcase is
no less exemplified in this first-party Mastodon app. Its color palette
is a welcome departure from Tootsuite‚Äôs (the mother web application,)
while still remaining definitively recognizable. The artwork dispersed
throughout the app is adorable, as you‚Äôve seen, and its bespoke audio
player is without a doubt my favorite of such devices.

image:xhtml/https:/i.snap.as/IRzEOzXl.png[Mastodon for iOS Audio Player]

Custom audio notifications especially stood out among those third-party
apps, so the project-sourced app‚Äôs inclusion of the iconic Mastodon
‚Äúboop‚Äù is yet another small inclusion that adds a surprising amount of
substance to the whole experience.

Though quite specific to myself and the few other iPhone users who
regularly command our handsets with physical keyboards, the Mastodon
app‚Äôs inclusion of *Bluetooth keyboard shortcuts* provoked a moment of
true euphoria when I first discovered them. As per my
‚Äò_https://github.com/extrakeys[iPhone and the Bluetooth Keyboard]_
project, I have bestowed upon Mastodon for iPhone semi-officially ‚Äúour‚Äù
Universal Clacker Award for its consideration of us ‚Äúfull
keyboard-strapped cellular phone users.‚Äù (As of this writing, the award
is just a ‚Äútrophy.‚Äù)

An important consideration to inform the perspective through which we
analyze such an app, I‚Äôd argue, is that *this app could have been very
bad*. Those who bewilderingly measure the success of social networking
services/protocols by their profit growth viability, alone, may well
suggest it _should_ have been bad. Had it been just mediocre,
half-assed, and/or full of bugs, I‚Äôm sure I would still have paused
everything to write and publish this review. The reality, though, is
nothing less than exceptional. Unlike some of the third-party examples I
discussed, I would argue Mastodon for iPhone to be an ‚Äúobjectively‚Äù
excellent piece of software in that I cannot imagine any one sort of
iPhone user _not_ finding it refreshing in some way.

I would sincerely worry for the person who feels nothing at all from the
artwork, the bespoke UI, or the general care exhibited in its
craftsmanship, _but_ they wouldn‚Äôt have exhausted reasons to use it.
From the very first beta release I installed to the first release
version pushed to the App Store just yesterday, the app has _never_
crashed, and the single bug I encountered was documented and fixed
before I had time to begin a feedback report. While Twitter‚Äôs official
iOS app does include a few Siri Shortcuts actions, they are all made
immediately useless by a universal command to open the app, itself.
Remove the obsessive insistence that any/all functions only be performed
with your app in focus ‚Äì even when it surely makes no difference to your
ad tech mechanism ‚Äì and you have Mastodon‚Äôs single action, ‚ÄúShow When
Run‚Äù toggle included.

I‚Äôm not sure what I expected from an ‚Äúofficial‚Äù Mastodon app upon first
reading that winter blog post, but what I‚Äôve been delivered is quite a
gem. Regardless of how its specific feature omissions may strike your
ideological organ(s,) you cannot deny that great time and energy was
invested in this app.

[[section0109.xhtml#a-rushed-request-for-pause-reflection-on-why-we-use-social-media]]
=== A rushed request for pause & reflection on _why_ we use social media.

I have not been able to follow any more accounts on Twitter ‚Äì from
https://twitter.com/NeoYokel[@NeoYokel], my primary, eldest account ‚Äì
for several years because of a limit implemented at some point by
Twitter and documented in
https://help.twitter.com/en/using-twitter/twitter-follow-limit[this help
document]. Considering the breadth of the mechanic's significance for
other users, I have often been compelled to explain this to new
followers. Recently, it occurred to me that a handy, brief explainer
page might streamline this process, so I created
‚Äúhttps://gist.github.com/extratone/8b762de50de414f8a4be05f9b0407fd8[Why
I Didn't Follow You Back]‚Äù ‚Äì in both GitHub Gist and Medium post form.
Other than a lack of reciprocity in engagement which I can only
speculate to occur in the minds of the opposite parties involved in this
dynamic, this limitation does not detract from my Twitter life, as I
exclusively consume content in Twitter Lists (which I have spoken about
extensively, elsewhere.)

https://open.spotify.com/episode/4veXFMCFGgz0Fjnx7UBkpl

A big theme in my 20s has been coming (slowly) to terms with the fact
that I built my entire adult social life around a single, centralized
social media Web Site. I mentioned this in
https://bilge.world/tweetbot-6-ios-review[my Tweetbot 6 review],
recently, but ‚Äì as I also strive to be a more sincere person and spend
more time adding value to _others_‚Äô lives ‚Äì I‚Äôve concluded that it is
the time now to speak as openly and vulnerably as I can about my ‚ÄúSocial
Media Methodology.‚Äù Most of the resulting insights will not be new
information, but I continue to encounter greater and greater confusion
in the face of my well-meaning behavior online and I have decided to
stop disregarding it.

This is _not_ an essay about how to ‚Äúoptimize‚Äù your social media use. It
is ‚Äì at least in part ‚Äì a sort of manifesto against the very idea of
designed online behavior beyond simply *being considerate* in a sense
that predates even the spoken word. I, myself, have occupied a position
well on the _chaotic_ side of the spectrum. You could say I have been
mostly _chaotic neutral_ throughout my 12 years on Twitter thus far, and
am actively working toward (and advocating for) _chaotic good_. Perhaps
inevitably, I'm going to wade into some experiences with a few specific
social media phenomena which I am particularly reacting to, here.

https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/753114804617932801

[[section0109.xhtml#assumptions-at-bat]]
=== Assumptions at bat

. For the vast majority of mainstream social users, no amount of [insert
vague overused marketing jargon noun] will _ever_ result in a
substantial accumulation of money/‚Äúinfluence‚Äù (which seems to be the
diluted zag of ‚ÄúPOWER‚Äù of the moment.) Those interested in learning
about ‚Äúmarketing‚Äù should know that no authority on the subject would
ever tell you to _start_ with Twitter ‚Äì this I can say with certainty.
. Though Twitter was designed upon certain frameworks with certain rules
which form quantifiable formulas where they are dependent upon a user's
choices/methodology to produce results which we _have_, indeed, become
more adept at predicting with study over time, it was _not_ created as a
_game to be won_. Perhaps more importantly, the ‚Äúprize‚Äù of ‚Äúwinning‚Äù in
the sense held by those who resist this assumption (notoriety,
‚Äúinfluence,‚Äù relevance) has continued to prove ultimately worthless (or
worse) time and time again throughout the very short history of the
cultural element as it exists today.
. If both 1 and 2 pass scrutiny, the only remaining reasonable
prerogatives in one‚Äôs social media use is to engage with _both_
strangers and friends in a manner which generally *adds value to the
lives of all involved*.
. 3 is not only _possible_ ‚Äì it is easily _reproducible_. Most of my
evidence is centered around my own experiences, but I believe ‚Äì if I
took the time ‚Äì I would be able to find infinitely many publicly-facing
examples.
. Though I am going to use my own methods to demonstrate 4, *neither my
ideas nor my behavior are the only means of interacting positively on
social media*.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7A-Gzn0wu3Q

I've come to the conclusion fairly recently that I need to become
brutally frank about the discrepancies I've observed between others'
accounts of their social media use and my own as soon as possible. The
great, ambient grousing summoned throughout The Plague from even the
first picogeneration to be born _directly_ into The Social Web really
challenged my assumptions about its _actual purpose_ in the day-to-day
lives of those in the center of the adoption curve. _You mean to tell me
you've been spending all that societally-alarming time on your phone...
On social media services... and you haven't made a single international
friend? Or happened across a single niche community surrounding some
bizarre practice or knowledge you'd long thought you were entirely alone
in? What exactly have you being doing with all that tapping since your
toddlerhood, then?_ I had absolutely no clue how utterly _ineffective_
the vast majority of nÃ≥oÃ≥rÃ≥mÃ≥iÃ≥eÃ≥sÃ≥ still are at using social media for its
general purpose in the most abstract sense: ‚Äú_human connection._‚Äú

The essential realization toward which (I desperately hope) the largesse
of America is being carried by conversations around
_https://www.harpercollins.com/pages/anuglytruth[An Ugly Truth]_, as
well as countless lower-profile essays, features, academic papers, and
general shit shooting is that the responsibility for this ignorance
rests _solely_ on the platforms who systematically reformed the controls
originally handed over by default to early adopters like me. I would
love (for both selfish and very humanitarian reasons) to be able to
proclaim some precious, one-of-a-kind genius as the sole differentiator
between my complete confidence in my ability to design and maintain
social software configurations that have kept my online consumption
_entirely_ free of unwanted encounters and the amount of regular
involuntary bullshit I hear described in the day-to-day online existence
of everyone around me. The truth, I suspect, involves my being of the
most privileged category of human in Western civilization combined with
the group of high school friends who adopted and socialized me. (A story
for another permalink, certainly, if not my equivalent of _Trick
Mirror_.)

~~More importantly, perhaps, I don't think I can recall a single
instance of sincere malice from within myself toward anyone who'd
actually converse with me. On the occasions I have been all huffy and
confrontational, I do not remember a single example in which I was
unwittingly ejected from a conversation left feeling _unsatisfied_.~~

Over the past few months, I've started a few Posts for this blog
regarding Twitter, its properties, and its recent feature addition
frenzy which I'll probably never finish. I finished the first and
narrowest one ‚Äì the aforelinked Tweetbot 6 review ‚Äì but the (debatably)
most important one ‚Äì highlighting how irresponsibly and distastefully
https://github.com/extratone/bilge/issues/79[Twitter butchered Periscope
and built Spaces atop its technology] ‚Äì would make less and less sense
as time goes on. I definitely got caught up in the ‚Äúdeath‚Äù of the live
video streaming service, fueled by my now quite old desire to celebrate
it, which I will hopefully accomplish _eventually_ in a very sentimental
essay. If I can successfully link them editorially, the subject
encompassing Spaces ‚Äì social audio's ‚Äúmoment‚Äù ‚Äì would also include
mention of RSS, ‚ÄúPodcasting‚Äù (the term describing the medium,) Spotify,
and Clubhouse, inevitably. Instead of counting on my future self
entirely, however, I'm going to begin by discussing that last one.

[[section0109.xhtml#the-th-social-audio-renaissance]]
=== The (‚ÄΩ‚ÄΩ‚ÄΩth) Social Audio Renaissance

Exactly one month ago, I finally
https://www.joinclubhouse.com/@davidblue[broke into Clubhouse] thanks to
a random kind stranger on Twitter who preferred not to be named. April
25th was the first time I set eyes on the app ‚Äì though I could've (and
usually would've) looked up screenshots and/or browsed the litter of how
tos available, I did not. By this time, I'd accumulated quite a bit of
experience with Twitter Spaces ‚Äì derided universally by tech media as a
‚ÄúClubhouse clone‚Äù ‚Äì and therefore assumed the original would be
‚Äúbetter,‚Äù at least in pure feature terms. What I found, however, was
even _less_ evidence that anyone building Clubhouse has been/is/intends
to be a regular Clubhouse user. Spaces, at least, included five emoji
reacts for listeners from the beginning: üíØ‚úä‚úåÔ∏èüëãüòÇ. Clubhouse's exclusive
means of Listener-Host interaction is Hand Raising, which is essentially
requesting to speak, even though the hand waving emoji is
_https://joinclubhouse.com/press[literally featured in their logo]_.
(The fact that neither have thought to add üôå is absolutely
inexcusable/inexplicable.)

In case you weren't aware, I appear to enjoy trying out new social
services. My password manager is full of literally thousands of
credentials for social media apps/services/startups ‚Äì most of which have
undoubtedly collapsed or been absorbed by a larger entity. Since
generating said credentials has become such an easy process, especially,
I tend to immediately sign up for an account on just about every one I
hear about. (I even have https://parler.com/#/user/Extratone[a Parler
profile] I cannot bear to actually look at.) Generally, I sign up,
follow anyone I know from elsewhere if given an account-bridging option,
poke around enough to figure out whether or not the service in question
could add something to my online existence, and end up leaving for good.
Most of these services are _not_ unique in any way, to a perplexing
degree. A few ‚Äì like Pinterest ‚Äì gain success separately as I give up on
trying to integrate them into my life. The miniscule remaining
percentage, though, end up becoming a part of my daily existence. The
most _recent_ of these dates back to April 2017, when I first discovered

==== The Feature Story

‚ÄúSocial Audio‚Äù did not begin with Clubhouse. Anchor originally launched
as a
‚Äúhttp://web.archive.org/web/20160209224846/https://anchor.fm/about[public
radio]‚Äù app, believe it or not. _Extratone_'s channel was actually the
https://www.patreon.com/posts/archived-our-day-11592398[first to be
featured] in their Music section, once upon a time. Frankly, that
happening was the most positive outcome of my social media service
accumulation habit. More recently, https://stereo.com/davidblue[Stereo]
launched, describing themselves as ‚Äúhttps://stereo.com/about[the premier
LIVE broadcast social platform that enables people to have and discover
real conversations in real time].‚Äù Bizarrely, the most legitimate media
coverage I could find of Stereo was
https://www.glamourmagazine.co.uk/article/stereo-app[from]
_https://www.glamourmagazine.co.uk/article/stereo-app[Glamour UK]_, and
its author definitely spent less than a day actually using the service.
Adam Corolla remains #1 on its earnings leaderboard and its
https://youtu.be/0GfGLUbc6fw[conversation export feature] is a personal
favorite. The
https://www.wired.com/story/the-future-of-social-media-is-all-talk[Big]
_https://www.wired.com/story/the-future-of-social-media-is-all-talk[WIRED]_
https://www.wired.com/story/the-future-of-social-media-is-all-talk[feature
on the subject] from December of last year does not mention Stereo but
lists three other ‚Äúalternatives:‚Äù https://wavve.co/[Wavve],
https://riffr.com/[Riffr], and https://www.spooncast.net/[Spoon]. (None
of which are actually competitors/alternatives. Sorry, Arielle.)

https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/1388936080645312520

I probably shouldn't proclaim to be an authority on social audio, but I
am definitely a veteran. From that context, I must say that Clubhouse is
horribly unoriginal ‚Äì not only in the sense that ‚Äúsuccessful‚Äù business
implementations of others', previous ideas tend to be diluted versions
of the original, but almost pitifully so. I will commend the app's
developers on their somewhat-thorough release notes (even though they
can be viewed only when first opening the app after an update instead of
_in the designated space on the App Store_,) but the extent of
_linkable_ Clubhouse documentation amounts to
https://joinclubhouse.com/blog[eight blog posts] and a
‚Äúhttps://www.notion.so/Community-Guidelines-461a6860abda41649e17c34dc1dd4b5f[Community
Guidelines]‚Äù Notion page. Though I've only been a user for one month, I
wonder what the fuck they've been doing since launch, given how
sparsely-featured the app is at this moment. There are Notifications,
Profiles, and Clubs ‚Äì the latter of which cannot be created until a user
surpasses an unknown threshold of renown(?) on the app. Competent
calendar integration may be the service's singular innovation, though
support for Outlook has yet to be added. The Big Issue, though, is
finding a ‚Äútalk‚Äù to attend that will not drive you utterly insane...

[[section0109.xhtml#the-grand-delusion]]
==== The Grand Delusion

I wrote the assumptions at the beginning of this Post in a single go
after https://twitter.com/neoyokel/status/1388930367671910404[a
particularly icky Sunday Clubhouse experience] out of a deep concern
that'd been growing since first exploring the app. The content I've
found there is not at all what I expected, to be honest. I've found it
almost entirely indecipherable, which makes critique beyond
https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/1388936080645312520[just fucking
screaming] difficult. _The New Yorker_'s Anna Wiener did a much better
job than I could realistically manage in
‚Äúhttps://www.newyorker.com/news/letter-from-silicon-valley/in-the-clubhouse[Clubhouse
Feels like a Party]:‚Äù

____
There was something pleasant about meandering from conversation to
conversation, as if I had walked into my own home to find a conference
in full swing. But I also wondered, Why did I let all of these people
into my house?

...

It is hard to shake the feeling that everyone on Clubhouse is selling
something: a company, a workshop, a show, a book, a brand.
____

More recently, her publication's nemesis declared
‚Äúhttps://www.vanityfair.com/news/2021/04/the-clubhouse-party-is-over[The
Clubhouse Party is Over],‚Äù but I wouldn't know. None of my friends have
ever Tweeted a Clubhouse link (determinable via
https://twitter.com/search?f=live&pf=on&q=%22joinclubhouse%22&src=typed_query[this
Twitter search].) Very few of the tech industry celebrities I follow
have, either ‚Äì pretty much just https://twitter.com/chrismessina[Chris
Messina] and https://twitter.com/Jason[Jason Calacanis]. This is
noteworthy because I believe https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/following[my
list of followed accounts on Twitter] to be particularly diverse. I
actively followed accounts across my various interests from ages 15-25
(when I hit my https://bit.ly/dbfollow[follow limit]) and basically
_never unfollowed anyone_. I would imagine there are several accounts
within that list which I would be ashamed to be associated with, now,
and yet none have shared a Clubhouse link. Reading any further into this
observation would require actual data journalism, which I'll leave to
the pros. It does prompt the question, though: if nobody I've ever known
or been interested in on Twitter is using Clubhouse, _who_ in fuck _is_?

Frankly, I do not understand the business incentive behind the massive
duplication of other software/services defining featuresets of late. I
see that Instagram stories have eclipsed Snapchat's in terms of
https://money.cnn.com/2018/06/28/technology/instagram-stories-users/index.html[sheer
user count], but I do not understand why its leaders would choose to
fuck their legacy by such blatant idea theft, much less why
https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/product/2020/introducing-fleets-new-way-to-join-the-conversation.html[Twitter],
https://techcrunch.com/2017/03/28/facebook-launches-stories-in-the-main-facebook-app[Facebook],
https://blog.patreon.com/lens/[Patreon] and even fucking
https://www.inputmag.com/culture/nobody-wants-stories-on-their-linkedin-feed[LinkedIn]
have implemented nearly-identical featuresets. Though I know Ben
Thompson's word on these matters should be easily digestible, I haven't
been able to actually take a bite. For the End User, especially, I
cannot even begin to conceive of what the leaders behind these decisions
imagine the day-to-day experience of the average social media user looks
like in the near future. _How many apps_ am I going to cycle through to
get a single story-type piece of content satisfactorily shared?
Personally, I currently use three, and sharing a single bit individually
across all of them one-by-one (since the current state of APIs is not
conducive to consumer-targeted mass-sharing tools) makes me feel utterly
insane.

https://youtube.com/watch?v=7uFR_bSxhTg

My lack of understanding would be meaningless if it were not so widely
shared among my peers ‚Äì young, brilliant, multifaceted, and distinctly
original creators who (in large part) make stuff on the internet
full-time. _They_ are who I'd actually plan ahead to hear from in a live
broadcast setting like Clubhouse or Twitter Spaces, but Twitch seems to
do just fine. For audio broadcasts, specifically, the _hip_, fresh
sources which come to mind are all distinctly Open Web:
https://datafruits.fm/[Datafruits.fm],
https://solarpunk.cool/magic/computer/club/[Solarpunk.cool],
http://poolside.fm/[Poolside.fm], and my Mastodon friend
https://radio.schizoid.tech/[Vanta's stream]. The potential of the term
‚Äúsocial audio‚Äù is truly being explored by projects like
https://www.patreon.com/RaveDJ[Rave.DJ] ‚Äì a homegrown, Patreon-funded
service for sharing mixes/mashups. On a smaller scale, the sky is the
limit for https://whyp.it/[Whyp.it] as a pure audio playback/annotation
tool for creators (as developed by Brad Varol, whom I
https://lnns.co/ZSadwt3Hnfi[interviewed in March].)

Compared to these, most of Clubhouse's communities seem bleak at best.
As I may or may not get around to arguing thoroughly about Twitter
Spaces, these services' fundamental, near-complete disinterest in
*Discovery* of new voices and their subsequent servitude to only their
most popular users should be extremely worrying for us all ‚Äì including
those who benefit most.

[[section0109.xhtml#the-consequences-of-strategy]]
=== The Consequences of Strategy

I have more than my fair share of stories and peeves about dating apps.
On several occasions, for instance, I have corrected those who cite
Tinder as the origin of the directional swiping interface, explaining
that it was actually the now-defunct service Hot or Not who did so some
15 years ago. (Why on Earth I am compelled to do so, nobody knows. Not
even God.) Somehow, though, I think most of us can agree that Tinder is
the _least shitty_ of the explicitly hookup-ish spectrum of the genre.
Or at least, I thought so, until I happened to spy the ‚ÄúPhoto Tip‚Äù
embedded above beneath a preview of my profile on the iOS app.

The innocuousness of this advice, which surely would not be dispensed in
_any_ other context without immediately screaming malice, has been on my
mind ever since. It is not the devil who tells you to make sure a
passing potential match doesn't immediately learn you have children, but
the Marketing Man. (Yes, they are distinct. I would explicitly
discourage that particular sort of demonization, mostly because it has
proven completely ineffective as cultural critique.) I am in no position
to relevantly explore the topic of Society & Sex, generally, other than
to insist that most people on Tinder _in my area_, at least, are not
looking to _leverage_ it _for the dick_. They are looking for dates, and
a good many are working class single mothers. To be clear, I‚Äôm not
trying to suggest anyone in this demographic would be ‚Äúfooled‚Äù by such a
suggestion. Offended, perhaps, and/or activated in such a way that would
lead to them replacing all of their profile‚Äôs pictures with photos of
_just_ their children. Regardless, this social group defined by a
distinct lack of free time, if nothing else, represents an antithesis to
the practice of _optimizing_ one‚Äôs _swipe ratio._

I think I‚Äôll stop there with this _Chapter of David Blue‚Äôs Tech
~~Gripes~~ Grapes_ and pledge to arrive back again exclusively through
haphazard/unintentional means, if I ever do.

=== Bewilderingly, Siri is genuinely great at something they were never designed for. The new ‚ÄúMake Spoken Audio From Text‚Äù action has finally been fixed.

When I first published my
https://bilge.world/iphone-ios-music-apps[iPhone & Music guide] this
past April, I‚Äôd been pretty active in
__https://discord.gg/DxQ9jry8J3[AppleScoop]__https://discord.gg/DxQ9jry8J3[‚Äôs
Discord Server], so I decided to share it there. Editor-in-Chief Flynn ‚Äì
a ridiculously talented web developer _and_ successful independent media
entrepreneur ‚Äì responded ‚ÄúI‚Äôm listening to it with the speak feature
right now. Is it your voice or someone else? üòõ,‚Äù Gourd bless his soul.
Here‚Äôs the specific audio he was talking about:

Of course, I am not a young black man, nor am I even remotely as adept
at https://bilge.world/why[reading my own work aloud] as the actual
talent, Siri Voice 3, who should be available on your iPhone/iPad right
this moment (as long as you‚Äôve updated iOS in the past six months,) via
`Settings ‚á® Siri & Search ‚á® Siri Voice`. (For more details, see
https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/change-siri-settings-iphc28624b81/ios[this
Apple Support page].)

image:xhtml/https:/i.snap.as/1f7argcU.png[New Siri Voices - iOS 14.5]

Of the four new Siri voices introduced earlier this year in iOS 14.5, 2
and 3 are by far my favorites, not just because of their
https://www.consumerreports.org/digital-assistants/apples-new-siri-voices-resonate-with-some-black-iphone-users/[resonance
with black iPhone users], but because they‚Äôre just _better_ in a sense
which I believe to be very significant.

https://youtube.com/watch?v=DkS5SYbsEW4

Before I get ahead of myself, though, I must acknowledge that I am not
the first to invest in Siri as a text-to-speech generator. In 2019,
https://twitter.com/atow[Adam Tow] released an immensely well-considered
Siri Shortcut called
‚Äúhttps://tow.com/shortcuts/record-text-to-speech/[Record Text to
Speech],‚Äù which provides an interface for recording, editing, and
managing text-to-speech audio files with Siri‚Äôs original voices. A
testament to its robustness: it _still works_ perfectly on my handset
running iOS 15 Dev Beta 6 despite having not been updated since
https://routinehub.co/shortcut/2506/[March of last year].

image:xhtml/https:/i.snap.as/I0Yh0jNn.png[Old Siri TTS Shortcuts]

I must admit that I found Adam‚Äôs shortcut more of a full _application_
than a speedy personal automation, with its full interactive UI menu and
darn near _800 actions_, so I made my own set of shortcuts based on the
same idea ‚Äì using iPhone‚Äôs native screen recording feature to capture
audio of Siri reading aloud ‚Äì and varying only by input (manual text
input, getting text from a file, or simply reading text from the
clipboard.) I‚Äôd then send the resulting screen recording in its original
video format to my PC, where I‚Äôd drop it in
https://www.audacityteam.org[Audacity], in which I‚Äôd run
https://github.com/extratone/bilge/blob/main/configuration/Audacity/TruncatenAmpMacro.txt[a
simple macro] on the audio that truncates silence and amplifies the
result so that the loudest point touches the rails. Then, I‚Äôd export it,
pass it through https://www.mp3tag.de/en/[Mp3Tag] to perfect its
metadata, and finally push the end-result .mp3 file to
https://github.com/extratone/bilge/tree/main/audio/TTS[a folder in]
_https://github.com/extratone/bilge/tree/main/audio/TTS[The Psalms]_
https://github.com/extratone/bilge/tree/main/audio/TTS[GitHub
Repository]. (I‚Äôll show you how to embed a web-bound audio file with its
direct URL in a webpage in the guide below.) This example was made using
this method, but with Siri‚Äôs original United States English Voice (for
https://bilge.world/tweetbot-6-ios-review[my Tweetbot 6 review]:)

Perhaps you‚Äôll agree with me that this process _does the job_ in
functional/accessibility terms, and does so quite well considering how
much one would pay to generate the same sort of audio file using
Google‚Äôs Cloud Platform or IBM‚Äôs Watson. Crucially, though, this
original voice was not one I could listen to at any length. Siri Voices
2 and 3, however, I _can_. From my perspective, this means they have
crossed a *very significant threshold* which I find vastly more
meaningful than just about all of those in the current discourse. Not
only can I tolerate them‚Ä¶ I genuinely _enjoy_ listening to super-long
magazine features read aloud by Siri Voice 2, especially, and I believe
I would regardless of the quite serious crush I‚Äôve developed on them.

https://twitter.com/neoyokel/status/1387809776072015873

Unfortunately, using the methods we‚Äôve discussed so far with the new
Siri voices is inconvenient, very hit-or-miss, and quite buggy. If you
scrub ahead toward the last third or so of the second audio player in
this post (after the post‚Äôs own,) you‚Äôll hear Siri Voice 2 start to bug
out in very amusing ways. Since Apple makes changes to Siri Shortcuts
between releases without any public documentation, none of them have
ever been reliable enough to write this guide. (For the past 6+ weeks at
least, it‚Äôs been too broken to be usable.) _However_, for whatever
reason, Apple created a dedicated spoken audio generation action for
Siri Shortcuts in iOS 15, called ‚ÄúMake Spoken Audio From Text.‚Äù

image:xhtml/https:/i.snap.as/MkHTYMkF.jpeg[Make Spoken Audio From Text
Action - iOS 15]

For the entirety of iOS 15‚Äôs Beta cycle up until Developer Beta 6‚Äôs
release, this past Tuesday, this action has been
https://mastodon.social/users/DavidBlue/statuses/106580821087349299[hilariously
broken], but as soon I discovered it‚Äôd been fixed (which was not
mentioned whatsoever in
https://developer.apple.com/documentation/ios-ipados-release-notes/ios-ipados-15-beta-release-notes[Apple‚Äôs
official release notes],) I immediately began composing this dang Post.

'''''

1.1]

[[section0110.xhtml#guide]]
== Guide

So! For those of you currently running the latest iOS 15 Beta and those
in the future running the full release, *what follows is a guide on how
you can use my own shortcuts and methods to generate, metadate, and
embed Siri-powered audio text-to-speech files relatively quickly without
having to use desktop-class (or any other) hardware*.

image:xhtml/https:/i.snap.as/P0yJJyUc.png[TTS Shortcuts Compared]

To begin, you should install two brand new shortcuts of mine:
*https://routinehub.co/shortcut/9953/[Make Audio from Article Body]* and
(if you intend to stick with me to the embed stage, anyway,) my
https://routinehub.co/shortcut/9948/[< audio > Embed Tool]. Both should
function out of the box, but I would highly encourage that you try
building your own shortcut around the `Make Spoken Audio From Text`
action, even if you've never worked with Shortcuts (or any sort of
automation, for that matter) before, _especially_ if you plan to be
using Siri as a text-to-speech generator with any frequency.

[[section0110.xhtml#intended-result]]
=== Intended Result

Throughout this guide, I'm going to be using
https://bilge.world/johnny-tsunami-smart-house-slavery[a five-year-old
ramble of mine] about the oddly-perceptive bits found in early-oughts
Disney movies as example text. Earlier today, I used my own personalized
version of my new shortcut to generate an example of in which the
process we're about to explore should result. The ~6000 words of text
took just over 3 minutes, 30 seconds to render consistently in three
consecutive timed attempts. You can listen to it
https://whyp.it/t/johnny-tsunami-vi-separate-but-equal-siri-voice-2-tts-74752[on
Whyp] and/or inspect
https://github.com/extratone/bilge/raw/main/audio/TTS/JohnnyTsunami.m4a[the
actual file] yourself, if you'd like.

image:xhtml/https:/i.snap.as/dktmGQQb.png[Plain Text Parsed by Safari]

[[section0110.xhtml#input-format]]
=== Input Format

If we were trying to do this using any other available method in 2021 ‚Äì
even the expensive ones ‚Äì our first task would be scrubbing our subject
text of any special formatting (Word,) symbols, embed, hyperlinks, and
any other data Siri doesn't understand (roman numerals, for example.) As
a Windows user who's not at all new to free ways to automate
accessibility improvements to web content, I envy both you and my new
self for the magic available to us in the form of Safari's abilities to
parse complex web content. In my experience, there's nothing like it (at
least nothing available to regular consumers.)

The screenshot embedded above shows the result of a `Quick Look` action
inserted just after the `Text` action produced by the public version of
my shortcut when run on our example. There are three immediately
problematic issues:

. Siri doesn't understand roman numerals, so she will read ‚ÄúJohnny
Tsunami VI‚Äù as _Johnny Tsunami vee eye_.
. ‚ÄúThe Psalms‚Äù is not my name, though it is what this blog currently
returns when asked for a byline. In my experience, this generally isn't
an issue with most mainstream media CMSs.
. The shortcut appears to have failed to retrieve any data for the
`Published Date` variable from my blog. (Also a relatively specific
consideration.)

If you'll note in the _previous_ embedded image comparing my custom
version of the shortcut (left) to the published version (right,) you'll
note that my chosen solution is to manually input all metadata before
actually starting the shortcut. What's not shown is my corresponding
manual inputs in the `Encode Trimmed Media` action, which includes
attaching a retrieved image file (in the Working Copy action you _can_
see) as album art. For my intended use ‚Äì exclusively generating
text-to-speech audio of Posts on this blog ‚Äì this makes more sense than
unnecessarily automating metadata retrieval.

The extraordinary thing about the screenshot, though, is that it doesn't
contain any of the other crap (as described above) found in the original
page. (Beforehand, it looked more
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/extratone/bilge/main/posts/johnny-tsunami-smart-house-slavery.md[like
this].) It's especially reliable at parsing WordPress-bound content,
which still makes up [sÃµÕïÃàÃÅÕäcÃ∂Ã•ÃèÃörÃ∂Ã•ÕàÃÉ√®Ã¥ÃôÕå√•Ã¥ÃπmÃµÃõÃÖÕÖiÃ∂Ã¶ÃæÕònÃ∏ÕéÃüÃéÃÉgÃ∂ÕéÕõ] percent of the whole web. *Treasure
this power*, folks.

image:xhtml/https:/i.snap.as/OMwKdOUI.png[Simpler TTS Examples]

If all you need read aloud is the body text, things become even simpler.
In the right example above, I've simply deleted the `Text` action and
replaced it with `Get text from [the Safari Web Article's body]`.
Theoretically, one could omit that action, even, and simply use the
direct output of `Get Body from Article` as input for the
`Make spoken audio from text` action, but I say keep the extra step
unless it becomes an issue.

*If you're actually _beginning_ with clean plain text* and don't care
about metadata in your final audio file and/or if you're planning on
passing the result through other audio/metadata editing software,
anyway, the left, three-action shortcut is all you need. It will result
in a https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Core_Audio_Format[Core Audio Format
(.caf)] file (like
https://github.com/extratone/bilge/blob/main/audio/egg.caf[this one],)
which I know absolutely nothing about except that Audacity and
GarageBand support it by default.

[[section0110.xhtml#sharing-embedding]]
=== Sharing/Embedding

Whichever route you traveled, you should have some sort of audio file,
at this point, and if you intend to share and/or embed it, you‚Äôll need
to upload said audio to some sort of Web Server which allows direct
playback/download of the raw file from external sources. Unless you‚Äôve
been skimming, you know by now that I‚Äôve been using
_https://github.com/extratone/bilge[The Psalms]_
https://github.com/extratone/bilge[GitHub Repository] to do this thus
far, though one isn‚Äôt really supposed to. Every few months, someone on
Stack Overflow figures out how to construct or discover the raw link to
a given Google Drive file before Google notices and alters it, and I‚Äôm
afraid you‚Äôll find just about every other cloud/file sharing service in
a similarly unreliable situation. If it‚Äôs going to be done at scale, I‚Äôm
afraid it‚Äôs ultimately going to require you rent regular, vanilla space
on an FTP-enabled fileserver, if one can still do that sort of thing. (I
will update this post if/when I find a more ideal solution.)

Within my current system, the raw URL to our example file looks like
this:

....
https://github.com/extratone/bilge/raw/main/audio/TTS/JohnnyTsunami.m4a
....

Using my aforelinked, ultra rudimentary
https://routinehub.co/shortcut/9948/[< audio > element Siri Shortcut
tool] (which I‚Äôve kept on my homescreen with good results for a few
months,) we can very quickly turn said raw URL into a properly-formatted
HTML5 audio player:

....
<audio controls>
  <source src="https://github.com/extratone/bilge/raw/main/audio/TTS/JohnnyTsunami.m4a">
</audio>
....

Ideally, on the final, reader-facing page, said code should create a
player like this:

If further configuration of the player is desired or necessary, see
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/audio[this
Mozilla page] for a full list of supported options. Obviously, there are
a few older methods of embedding audio players, but I am neither
qualified nor interested in exploring them. If you‚Äôre in a frustrating
bind, I recommend https://bit.ly/extwa[signing up for my CMS]. (Just try
it, okay?)

[[section0110.xhtml#pwoof]]
=== Pwoof

For the sake of bare minimum sample variety, I ran Version 1.0 of the
public Make Audio from Article Body shortcut on an article hosted not on
WordPress, nor my own CMS, but on Bustle‚Äôs ultra-slick, totally-bespoke
system (which
https://www.codeandtheory.com/things-we-make/the-outline[began as]
_https://www.codeandtheory.com/things-we-make/the-outline[The Outline]_,
FYI.) I chose the first permalink I saw in one of its ‚Äúregular‚Äù article
formats ‚Äì not a long feature, nor one of their touch-targeted
slideshows.

‚Äúhttps://www.inputmag.com/tech/onlyfans-is-banning-porn-the-very-thing-that-made-it-big[OnlyFans
is banning porn, the very thing that made it big]‚Äù is an 870-word newsy
piece written by Tom Maxwell, who is the only New York Media person ever
to accept my Facebook friend request. (Thanks again, Tom.) Without any
tweaking, I was able to run the shortcut (from within the Shortcuts app
since the Share Sheet appears to be thoroughly fucked at the moment) in
a reasonable amount of time ‚Äì less than 5 minutes, more than 2 ‚Äì and
generate the file embedded below. Notably, I also used a different
hosting service ‚Äì
https://mastodon.social/web/statuses/106798701662102859[mastodon.social]
‚Äì but I certainly don‚Äôt plan on doing so at scale and neither should

Honestly, _Input_‚Äôs CMS is the cleverest challenge I was able to come up
with for this single-day-old shortcut of mine, and I‚Äôm quite proud of
the result. Though it wasn‚Äôt able to retrieve a timestamp, it correctly
retrieved the article‚Äôs title and byline without fuss and even managed
to scrape and attach said article‚Äôs featured image as the file‚Äôs cover
art, though the original‚Äôs aspect ratio was obviously sacrificed.

[[section0111.xhtml#it-s-been-a-tough-summer-for-the-always-feature-focused-tribe]]
=== It's been a tough summer for the _Always Feature-Focused_ Tribe.

Eighty days ago, Apple's Senior Vice President of Software Engineering
~~stood up in front of a crowd of~~...

No!... It was just me... Alone, in my mother‚Äôs basement, on a Monday
morning, contorted at stupid angles, typing to my phone with a physical
keyboard and unapologetically scarfing as much as I possibly could of
the Apple community‚Äôs unbelievably unreserved, almost _spiritual_ volume
of *pure hype* from as many simultaneous sources as I could manage.
(Hilariously, _all_ of said sources are/were Discord servers, now, as in
that ‚Äúgamer‚Äù communications service I launched my little indie mag on in
2015 and https://bilge.world/discord-slack-comparison[kept comparing to
Slack], but like an actual madman.)

Anyway, said Senior Vice President of Software Engineering (who we are
encouraged to hold accountable for basically all technical changes to
iOS) is named Craig, and these are his first few sentences:

____
`For many of us, our iPhone has become indispensable. And at the heart of iPhone is iOS. iOS powers the experiences we've come to rely on. This year, we were inspired to create even more meaningful ways iPhone could help you. Our new release is iOS 15. It's packed with features that make the iOS experience adapt to and complement the way you use iPhone...`
____

I‚Äôm dwelling on them because they are *patently meaningless*. Very
little to nothing coming in iOS 15 is what I would call
_ease-of-use-centric_. Some of it ‚Äì namely controversial (and now
backpedaled) changes to the user interface of Safari ‚Äì feels almost
maliciously quartered in the opposite direction. Most of the changes in
the subheadings of
*https://www.apple.com/ios/ios-15-preview/features/[the full feature
list]* are simply irrelevant in the use for all but the dorkiest iOS
users, like myself, and I find the fact unacceptable, at the very least.

image:xhtml/https:/i.snap.as/t2IieKLq.png[The Foundation Image]

This is why I would like to try something different, this year, and
focus on an entirely different audience: my family, as representatives
of the vast majority of the iPhone‚Äôs billion-something demographic
(read: customers.) That is to say, who Craig _should_ be referring to
with the phrase ‚Äúmost of us.‚Äù Not because I believe them to be ‚Äúdumb‚Äù or
‚Äúend users‚Äù (in the tech bro derogatory sense,) but because they are
busy, working people who depend on their iPhone as a _utilitarian_
device, above all else. They don‚Äôt have the time to dive deep into Apple
documentation or watch the whole WWDC presentation to gain an
understanding of where to look for new features or (unfortunately) how
to turn them off. Realistically, they don‚Äôt even have time to read this
whole Post, though I hope they will (sorry fam.)

Regardless of how we feel about it, Apple has made it clear that our
phones are going to be further and further inundated with automated
processes in the background. Whether you like it or not, your phone is
going to be used to help find other users‚Äô devices over the Find My
network, your travel information is going to be used to inform Apple
Maps‚Äô live traffic statistics, and so on. For the more conservative
members of my family, related truths about their phones are going to
continue to feel like we are continuing to give up ‚Äúownership‚Äù of our
devices. There are definitive alternatives, but they involve giving up a
whole lot of conveniences. I will do my best to address this a bit later
on, drawing from much more articulate critics than I.

image:xhtml/https:/i.snap.as/eBBnwCIn.png[Testing Home Screens for iOS
15]

What I _will_ dwell on, myself, are the more menial, tactile
implications of these abstract changes in design philosophy. A general
theme of my own use/writing about iOS has been re-finding or
jury-rigging the ‚Äúbuttons‚Äù which are gradually being obscured or
eliminated entirely in the assumption that Apple‚Äôs automation knows
better than us users when something should happen or change. A great
example: using
https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/ac6a4587d5b54abc934631c214d81c0c[a
simple Siri Shortcut] to completely disable Wi-Fi and Bluetooth instead
of trusting the https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208086[unnecessarily
complex conditions] of doing so with the buttons in Control Center. I
have sought out these ‚Äúhacks‚Äù (as other iOS powerusers have rather
absurdly called them) for very selfish reasons.

image:xhtml/https:/i.snap.as/oHqejXq1.png[Safari Settings in iOS 15]

[[section0111.xhtml#the-gist]]
=== The Gist

Rounder, still! From the first time you enter your passcode immediately
after installing iOS 15, you‚Äôll notice that Notifications and other
elements have had their rounded corners _further_ rounded, for some
reason. Assuming Safari ships with its new look turned on by default,
the screenshots embedded above show two locations (subject to change)
where one can switch it off. (Your best bet is to visit *its menu in
Settings* as displayed on the right in `Settings ‚á® Safari`.) As of this
writing, at least two of iOS 15‚Äôs ‚Äúheadlining‚Äù features have been pushed
to further iterative updates:
https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/ios-15-apple-shareplay-tv-delay-b1904548.html[SharePlay]
and
https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/25/icloud-private-relay-ios-15-public-beta/[iCloud
Private Relay]. I suspect you will be prompted to explore Focus Modes
upon initial installation, which I will eventually analyze in relative
detail. Ideally, you‚Äôll also be prompted to explore ‚ÄúShared With You,‚Äù
which I personally believe to be the release‚Äôs most significant addition
for most people, by far.

As far as ‚Äúmeaningful ways iPhone could help you,‚Äù I see little more
than glimmers. Focus Modes would be promising were they not so complex
to set up, and Notification Summaries are (as of this moment) a pretty
hopeless implementation of a theoretically useful concept. Some
additional filters in Apple Maps search will prove useful so long as the
associated metadata has been updated for locations _other_ than San
Francisco (say, mid-Missouri.) Optical Character (text) Recognition has
been implemented ‚Äúsystem wide‚Äù under the feature Apple terms ‚ÄúLive
Text,‚Äù and translation has finally been extended to the places where
it‚Äôs most useful (think: Safari.)

In general, though, most of what‚Äôs coming with iOS 15 has little real
value in the day-to-day experience for most iPhone users. A complete
inversion of Craig‚Äôs phrase feels significantly more accurate: _This
year, we were inspired to create even more superficial ways iPhone could
temporarily dazzle tech media_.

And now, I‚Äôd like to take you through what I feel are the considerations
I‚Äôd like my family to know ‚Äì namely my 70-year-old mother, who depends
100% on her iPhone and MacBook Pro every day to run her private practice
‚Äì but also my ~8 nieces and nephews spanning 6th grade-graduate school,
who all ‚Äì if I‚Äôm not mistaken ‚Äì have iPhones.

....
Worthy of note: this ‚Äúreview‚Äù is very heavily focused on *iOS* - which is to say *iPhone* - to the point where any overlap with iPadOS/MacOS/WatchOS/HomeOS/any other goddamned operating system are purely coincidental. For coverage of those changes, please seek your regular sources.

in iOS 15]

[[section0111.xhtml#photos]]
=== Photos

[[section0111.xhtml#shared-with-you]]
==== Shared With You

The single most important/welcome feature addition to iOS 15 for most
people, I believe, is found in Apple‚Äôs native Photos app and entitled
*Shared With You*. This view ‚Äì found in the second tab in the bottom
navigation row (‚ÄúFor You‚Äù) ‚Äì is a reverse-chronological timeline of
every bit of media (photos & videos) you‚Äôve ever been sent over
iMessage. For those with a lot of iOS-using friends (unlike myself,) I
would imagine the list will take quite a while to populate.

[[section0111.xhtml#memories]]
==== Memories

I find Alex Guyot‚Äôs bit on changes to Memories (from
https://www.macstories.net/stories/ios-and-ipados-15-the-macstories-overview/[his
iOS 15 overview for]
_https://www.macstories.net/stories/ios-and-ipados-15-the-macstories-overview/[MacStories]_)
much more concise than what I‚Äôd written, so here it is almost in full:

____
Memories can now be set to your favorite songs from Apple Music, and can
be customized with color filters. Setting different filters will result
in different song choices and transition effects to nail a wider variety
of vibes on Memories videos.

While watching a video generated by Memories, you can tap and hold at
any time to freeze a photo so that it doesn‚Äôt transition away. The song
playing over the video will not pause when you do this, but when you let
go the remaining video transitions and timings will be automatically
altered to match back up with the song‚Äôs beat.

If you don‚Äôt want to go with the song that was chosen automatically, you
can tap the new Music button to get a pop-up interface into Apple Music,
allowing you to choose a song manually. This interface will include
smart suggestions for other songs that Apple thinksd you‚Äôll like which
would also fit the vibe of your video.
____

https://youtube.com/watch?v=7uFR_bSxhTg

Yeah. I hope you‚Äôre at least half as amused as I have continued to be by
algorithmic video generation. https://youtu.be/7uFR_bSxhTg[The above
result] was created with absolutely zero modification from an album of
images and videos which Photos automatically created via face
recognition. The only other coherent option from my own limited set of
photos is really the only one that matters, I think you'll agree. ‚ÄúPet
Friends‚Äù yielded https://youtu.be/-1bA7-oslkc[inevitably uplifting
results] in all three of my test renders, but ‚Äì given a crop of cute dog
photos ‚Äì little intelligence is necessary to produce.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1bA7-oslkc

If you're experiencing any sort of D√©j√† vu from the idea of
auto-generated slideshows with rights-free soundtracks in the Photos
app, it's because Apple has made several distinct attempts to implement
very similar iterations of the feature throughout iPhone's history,
which has involved iMovie on iOS and MacOS once or twice. I have fiddled
with every one ‚Äì including iOS 15's ‚Äì and my (truly sound and original)
advice is to *avoid spending time trying to customize auto-generated
videos* in general. If you explore one of the suggested Memories and
find the software's default result satisfactory, of course you should
save it, but be wary of any attempts to take editorial control yourself.

image:xhtml/https:/i.snap.as/74HOlnLP.png[Visual Lookup Indicator in iOS
15]

[[section0111.xhtml#visual-lookup]]
==== Visual Lookup

Perhaps the most unjustifiable background use of your phone‚Äôs resources
introduced in iOS 15, ‚ÄúVisual Lookup,‚Äù seeks to identify ‚Äúpopular art
and landmarks around the world, plants and flowers out in nature, books,
and breeds of pets‚Äù present in your photos so that you might‚Ä¶ identify
them more swiftly(?) The only means of distinguishing photos on which
Visual Lookup has been applied is to look for the modified ‚ìò symbol at
the very bottom of your screen in the photo browsing view (see the
screenshot embedded above.) As you might notice in the screenshots
_below_, not one of its analyses on my own images was usably accurate.

The decision to target the feature on identifying domesticated pets,
specifically, is more universalizing than historic landmarks, for sure,
but it also immediately sets up the technology (at least this preview of
it) for failure.

image:xhtml/https:/i.snap.as/AtxzN45h.png[Visual Lookup in iOS 15]

[[section0111.xhtml#metadata]]
==== Metadata

Hooray! You can now view an image's basic details in the ‚ÄúInfo pane,‚Äù by
swiping up on an image or using the ‚ìò button. This includes the
extension (type) and size of the image file, camera identification and
configuration details, and ‚Äì as part of Shared With You ‚Äì from
whom/where you got the image. Bizarrely, the ‚ÄúAdjust‚Äù tool also lets you
alter a given image's timestamp and location information. While I can
imagine infinitely many reasons why you'd want to _omit_ or _delete_
such information, I cannot conceive of a single wholesome reason why one
would chose to _change_ it, instead.

image:xhtml/https:/i.snap.as/93BGmX4I.png[Photo Stacks in iOS 15]

[[section0111.xhtml#messages]]
==== Messages

Just a few weeks shy of
https://web.archive.org/web/20120308031950/https://www.apple.com/ios/features.html[iMessage's
tenth birthday], Apple has finally added a button to save incoming
photos directly in Messages conversations. It's about as blatant as
Apple interface design gets ‚Äì you'll spot it opposite others' images.
Tapping it saves the appropriate photo(s) directly to the Recents folder
before a silly animation vanishes the button itself.

Once again, from Mr. Guyot:

____
Groups of photos that you send will now be shown as stacks instead of in
a long list, allowing you to more easily swipe through the images
without losing track of the conversation around them. Tap on a stack to
open a grid view where you can see and select multiple photos at once.
____

I took the screenshot embedded above in iOS 15 Developer Beta 5, and‚Ä¶ Do
‚Äústacks‚Äù not look hilariously janky as fuck?

image:xhtml/https:/i.snap.as/DNJOKq85.png[Live Text in iOS 15]

[[section0111.xhtml#live-text]]
==== Live Text

For someone like myself, iOS 15‚Äôs system-wide integration of Optical
Character Recognition is undoubtedly its most useful addition by far.
Throughout the Developer Beta, it‚Äôs moved up this list gradually as I‚Äôve
come to see how it could be useful for _you_, as well.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3kj0-q4k9k

The https://youtu.be/y3kj0-q4k9k[video embedded above] is a very rough
demo, but I suspect it‚Äôs more ‚Äúauthentic‚Äù than most you‚Äôd see elsewhere.
The ability to _accurately_ capture text right from the camera is
invaluable, but for most folks, _line breaks_ are going to be a real
problem. I‚Äôm working on a way to address this with a Siri Shortcut,
which I‚Äôll obviously share here when/if I succeed.

[[section0111.xhtml#audio]]
=== Audio

https://youtube.com/watch?v=KhxtfW0taIY

[[section0111.xhtml#background-sounds]]
==== Background Sounds

My eldest sister has used a sound/noise machine to sleep for as long as
I can remember, so I was especially excited to show her iOS 15‚Äôs native
‚ÄúBackground Sounds‚Äù feature, but she was distinctly unimpressed, noting
that her iPhone-based sound generation needs were well met by
third-party apps she‚Äôd already discovered.[^1] I didn‚Äôt have time to try
out her recommendations, but I‚Äôm going to assume they aren‚Äôt able to
operate ‚Äúbehind‚Äù _additional_ audio playback like the ‚Äúnew‚Äù native
feature is.

image:xhtml/https:/i.snap.as/SGQt93K4.png[Background Sounds Interrupt
Remedy]

My personal (hopefully insightful) anecdote: Background Sounds appear to
be impervious from the audio interruption issues iOS has struggled with
since its origin, which makes them a partial remedy to the discomfort of
sudden, unexpected silence when using headphones with active noise
cancellation. As configured in the screenshot embedded above (the menu
found in `Settings ‚á® Accessibility ‚á® Audio/Visual ‚á® Background Sounds`)
‚Äì with ‚ÄúUse When Media Is Playing‚Äù toggled `OFF`‚Äì your selected
Background Sound _should_ fade in when normal playback from another app
is interrupted.[^2]

[[section0111.xhtml#spatial-audio]]
==== ‚ÄúSpatial Audio‚Äù

Just to be clear, I strongly believe that normal users should basically
ignore all mention of Apple‚Äôs ‚ÄúSpatial Audio‚Äù (read: don‚Äôt worry about
it) for a few reasons, most of which aren‚Äôt all that interesting. Since
https://bilge.world/mono-audio-playback[one of my very first written
works on tech] was/is directly related to the subject, though, indulge
me for just a moment for an attempted explanation. Firstly, I must note
that only two audio channels (the stereo experiences in various forms
you‚Äôve certainly had in your life, regardless of who you are) are
necessary for audio to become ‚Äúspatial.‚Äù If you‚Äôre curious about this,
https://pudding.cool/2018/02/waveforms/[my favorite all-time web
experience from] _https://pudding.cool/2018/02/waveforms/[The Pudding]_
is an absolutely impeccable next destination. Secondly, the actual
technology behind Apple‚Äôs title was not developed by Apple, but by
Dolby. It‚Äôs not that Apple doesn‚Äôt acknowledge this thoroughly in
https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212182[their explainer docs], nor is
Dolby by any means a wee organization in need of my amplification, but
this is one of those Apple habits that‚Äôs become a particular peev. If
you‚Äôre interested,

iPhone 7 or later, _and_ an Apple Music subscription, you might want to
disregard my cynicism at least long enough to try

[[section0111.xhtml#shareplay]]
==== SharePlay

_The Verge_‚Äôs Chaim Gartenburg did
https://www.theverge.com/22577178/shareplay-how-to-apple-facetime-ios-15-ipados-macos-monterey-apple-tv-video-music[an
excellent ‚Äì if a bit precocious ‚Äì job of explaining] what he describes
as iOS 15‚Äôs ‚Äúheadline feature,‚Äù called SharePlay:

____
It‚Äôs a new software feature on top of FaceTime that allows you to watch
and listen to movies, TV shows, music, podcasts, and more with friends
and family while video chatting.
____

In my opinion, SharePlay represents one of those great, well-thought
solutions to some notably youth-specific challenges which nobody (even
the youth) will see as more worthwhile than their own. By that I mean,
one ear bud per person‚Ä¶ now, an ancient tradition. I‚Äôve deprioritized
it, in contrast to Chaim, because I‚Äôd bet it‚Äôs also one of those things
one can only learn themselves.

image:xhtml/https:/i.snap.as/TFWvW1b6.png[Notifications in iOS 15]

[[section0111.xhtml#notifications-focus-and-attention]]
=== Notifications, Focus, and Attention

Yes, notifications have gotten _even rounder still_ for some reason in
iOS 15. Contact photos and ‚Äúlarger app icons‚Äù also ‚Äúmake them easier to
identify,‚Äù according to Apple. (This is the one point in my whole
writing life where the phrase _well I‚Äôll be the judge of that!_ is 100%
valid and applicable.) There‚Äôs also a new feature called *Notification
Summary* which is an absolutely useless and unnecessary complication, at
least at the moment. Honestly, the one bit of solid advice from
_https://bilge.world/the-social-dilemma[The Social Dilemma]_ was‚Ä¶ Just
turn all Notifications off, or at least as many as possible.
Notifications Summary feels like a near direct response to that one
goddamned film, and its new Focus Modes do even more so.

[[section0111.xhtml#focus-es]]
==== Focus(es)

The most glaringly standout parallel between Microsoft‚Äôs Windows 11
release (which I have also been beta testing much less dutifully for
most of this year) and Apple‚Äôs stated goals in iOS 15‚Äôs design centers
around the design supposition that maximum malleability of the ‚Äúspaces‚Äù
in which one dwells on their operating system ‚Äì namely, the ‚Äúdesktop(s)‚Äù
and/or ‚Äúhome screen(s)‚Äù ‚Äì lends toward a more healthy digital occupancy
of them, especially in terms of attention. Unfortunately, both of them
chose respective solutions which ‚Äì from my view, anyway ‚Äì *add
complexity* more than anything.

I could be wrong, but I suspect very few among my family will find the
time investment required worth the end result, but we‚Äôll see.

I chose to embed https://youtu.be/YZCx-9wF3ow[Matt Birchler‚Äôs guide to

I‚Äôve yet seen on iOS 15, generally, and demonstrates how a working
person might actually use Focus. My one addendum to this (and any other
Focus) guide: *proceed _without_ the automated bits* by avoiding
anything under the `TURN ON AUTOMATICALLY` subsection of the menu. For
whatever reason, location-based automation triggers on iPhone,
especially, have literally *never* functioned usefully (or _reliably_)
in my experience.

[[section0111.xhtml#maps-carplay]]
=== Maps & CarPlay

(I _am_ going to do a bit of editorializing on this subject,
specifically.) If the video embedded above is confusing, know that it's
a very insular joke ‚Äì over six years ago, in https://bit.ly/JukeHonk[my
video review of the Nissan Juke NISMO], I praised its integrated
navigation screen specifically for its frugality.

____
I'm not old. I don't need a gigantic nav screen. I don't need to see a
3D rendition of the whole Earth and my position relative to it.
____

...and yet, a playful, exploratory experience is what Apple has in mind
for Maps, apparently. Here's their description of the new ‚ÄúInteractive
globe‚Äù feature:

____
Discover the natural beauty of Earth with a rich and interactive 3D
globe, including significantly enhanced details for mountain ranges,
deserts, forests, oceans, and more.
____

In the footnotes, it‚Äôs explained that the feature will only be available
on ‚ÄúiPhone with A12 Bionic or later,‚Äù meaning the iPhone X range,
basically, which makes sense considering the extent of animation and
touch manipulation technology present in this view. It‚Äôs an entertaining
plaything, but not much more, which is strange and frustrating. If I
could gather the usage statistics across all my family‚Äôs iPhones, how
much time would you suppose they‚Äôve spent in Apple Maps to date
_screwing around_ as opposed to _searching and navigating_?

https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/1437519482428272641

Put another way ‚Äì Apple‚Äôs developmental direction for Apple Maps as a
service seems distinctly toward a travel/entertainment application
(notably, like
https://apps.apple.com/us/app/google-earth/id293622097[Google Earth],)
instead of a utilitarian navigation app (like
https://apps.apple.com/us/app/google-maps/id585027354[Google Maps],
https://apps.apple.com/us/app/waze-navigation-live-traffic/id323229106[Waze],
or
https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mapquest-gps-navigation-maps/id316126557[MapQuest].)
It‚Äôs not just the Interactive globe. One of the most exciting features
in last year‚Äôs release (iOS 14) was the ability for Maps users to create
custom Guides. I created https://bit.ly/columbiaguide[my own] containing
a few local spots I believe to be especially relevant for first-time
travelers/new residents of _my_ area. Clearly, I misinterpreted the
intended function of Guides entirely ‚Äì continuing without a means of
discovering _user-generated_ guides, whatsoever, iOS 15 cements (in my
view) that they‚Äôll instead continue to be left to travel magazines, none
of which I recognize save for _Atlas Obscura_, who‚Äôs
‚Äúhttps://guides.apple.com/?lsp=9902&pg=15126682529740253227[Hidden

representation of the Midwest on the service.

As of this writing, it‚Äôs unclear how much of the Maps features I‚Äôve used
will be carried over to CarPlay upon iOS 15.0.0‚Äôs official release, but
I know for _certain_ that CarPlay is a weekly (if not daily) used
feature by virtually all of my family members. With the additional
variable of
https://www.apple.com/ios/carplay/available-models/[differences in
support between given automobile marques/models] ‚Äì including which
support https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211234[Car Key] ‚Äì it‚Äôs
difficult to say definitively what will have changed about your personal
CarPlay use. What experience I do have using CarPlay has been
exclusively with my mom‚Äôs https://youtu.be/hqQqfdHsGx0,[2019 Volkswagen
Jetta] and documented visually in https://snap.as/extratone/ios15[this
photo gallery] as well as
https://www.instagram.com/dieselgoth/channel[on my alt Instagram]‚Äôs ‚ÄúiOS
& iPhone‚Äù IGTV Series.

To once again cite from
https://hyp.is/Cbc_LBUmEey4S4Mcwd1lKA/www.apple.com/ios/ios-15-preview/features/[the
official full features list]:

____
An all-new driving map helps you see traffic, incidents, and other
details that affect your drive at a glance. See incredible road details
like turn lanes, bike, bus, and taxi lanes, medians, crosswalks, and
much more. When approaching a complex interchange, Maps switches to a 3D
road-level perspective to help you find your way.‚Äù
____

‚ÄúIt's faster and easier to report an issue in Maps‚Äù is a standout,
literal statement. Once you've navigated to the menu in the screenshot
below (via the chatbox with exclamation point icon,) touching any of the
three options will _immediately_ report its respective information
without confirmation.

image:xhtml/https:/i.snap.as/VKfuhJvH.png[Report an Incident - CarPlay
in iOS 15]

The default *Driving Focus* can be configured to activate automatically
as soon as CarPlay connects which _would_ be the single exception from
my earlier advice against automating Focus modes at all were it not for
the mode's lockout from the Lock Screen (as shown in the first of the
three screenshots embedded below.)

image:xhtml/https:/i.snap.as/m5974FcB.png[Driving Focus in iOS 15]

Once you've locked your device with the Driving Focus on, you must clear
an extra step to unlock it by selecting ‚ÄúI'm Not Driving,‚Äù which then
turns the Focus off. In my (unsolicited) opinion, this renders the Focus
unusable at best and arguably downright dangerous. ‚ÄúHey Siri!‚Äù is an
option most folks I know leave off and I can't imagine a single reason
to add such an obstruction.

image:xhtml/https:/i.snap.as/xcNfKv6g.png[Custom Car Focus - iOS 15]

I _can_ offer a solution, however, in the form of my custom Car Focus,
which only allows calls and texts from my mom, open a single,
otherwise-hidden custom (work-in-progress) Home Screen with exclusively
driving/nav/travel-relevant apps, and even activates automatically via a
very simple automation in
https://apps.apple.com/us/app/shortcuts/id1462947752[the Shortcuts app].
Technically, the only feature it's missing from the default Driving
Focus are automatic text replies, which (as of beta) weren't working
anyway.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hNCsS4I0uk

For those new to Siri Shortcuts completely, I recorded a
https://youtu.be/-hNCsS4I0uk[rough video guide] on how to set up both
the Focus and its automation.

on‚Ä¶ ‚Äì Apple‚Äôs Reminders app has always had perhaps the most
insurmountable task of all its native applications in remaining
competitive. Up until I wrote this review, my personal list in the app
was nothing but a wasteland of forgotten, out-of-context items from up
to 7 years ago (!) which I‚Äôd obviously set with Siri without bothering
to correct its voice recognition.

Before you proceed to experiment with Reminders, I‚Äôd recommend using my
https://routinehub.co/shortcut/10118[Reminders Backup Siri Shortcut] to
create a .zip file of _all_ existing items in your Reminders app, even
if there are just a few. I insist upon this largely because it‚Äôs so fast
and so frugal. (Here‚Äôs

=== Safari

....
Before you read on‚Ä¶ If you‚Äôre just wondering how to make Safari go back to the way it was before, refer back to the first subhead on this page (‚ÄúThe Gist.‚Äù)
....

The one commonality in the experience of every single person finishing
up their iOS 15 review/overview/guide: we‚Äôve all saved Safari for the
very last minute. I am 99% certain the saga surrounding changes to
Apple‚Äôs native web browser ‚Äì along with my personal, reactionary gripes
spewed along the past two months of iOS 15‚Äôs Developer Beta cycle ‚Äì were
the overwhelmingly affirming factors that led to me pursuing this very
review. I have rewritten this portion over and over again, but now that
you know how to disable the new look, I‚Äôm going to as briefly as
possible summarize the changes that are actually relevant to you.

image:xhtml/https:/i.snap.as/U6SKFiXN.png[Overamped Browser Extension]

* You can now *pull down to refresh*, which apparently the youths
_actually_ refer to with the acronym ‚ÄúPTR,‚Äù these days.
* *Safari Extensions* might be worthwhile. I *absolutely insist* that
everyone reading this install one called

I have been testing. Basically, you‚Äôll never need to think about Google
AMP again, which is an absolute gift, I promise.
* *Tab Groups* will almost certainly be nothing but a nuisance for all
but the most ridiculous iPhone poweruses like myself.[^3]

Finally, the great, terrible Apple God has granted its bizarre animated
minimes a torso! I have always found memoji
https://www.reddit.com/r/iphone/comments/he03xb[alarming], mostly, but
now that I‚Äôve paid them mind, I would like to express my sympathy for
those of you who enjoy using them. I‚Äôm sorry to report that you will
still need to go to `Messages` and open the compose window in a
conversation in order to select the emoji iMessage app. Though iOS 15
adds full bodies to memoji (and clothes to cover them, as required since
Adam & Eve,) as well as ‚Äúaccessible accessories,‚Äù[^4] there‚Äôs not as yet
any way to actually _see_ a memoji in full-body view other than the
editing interface (as far as I could tell.) You can also choose to
separately color your memoji‚Äôs eyes.

Comedy]

[[section0111.xhtml#facetime-in-the-browser]]
==== Facetime in The Browser

Yes, you can _technically_ Facetime with non-Apple devices thanks to iOS
15's changes. In fact, you'll be able to ‚ÄúFacetime‚Äù any device with a
web browser! _However_, in doing so you will be forgoing every single
one of Facetime's advantages: call quality, ‚Äúprivacy,‚Äù ecosystem
integration, etc. Without these, it would be silly to use Facetime over
literally _any_ other video calling service. What an immense waste of
time, eh?

https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/1430679850399014912

For the sake of thoroughness, though, I should note that I appear to be
alone in this view of the new Facetime changes. _MacStories_ founder and
Ultimate iPad Sage Federico Viticci‚Äôs
https://www.macstories.net/stories/facetimes-audio-and-video-take-a-leap-forward-with-apples-upcoming-iphone-ipad-and-mac-os-updates/[report
on the subject] was one of mostly satisfaction.

I will note, too, that
https://whyp.it/t/testing-the-mic-modes-coming-in-facetime-with-ios-15-54749[my
test] of the new ‚ÄúMic Modes‚Äù function yielded impressive results (along
with a few other experiences I‚Äôve had so far,) especially in the ‚ÄúVoice
Isolation‚Äù mode‚Äôs performance, but ‚Äì
https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/1430680198442332160[as I lamented on
Twitter] ‚Äì its association with FaceTime makes it unavailable where one
actually could make use of it on iOS.

[[section0111.xhtml#omissions]]

testing iPhone updates, I have never experienced such a disastrous cycle
as 15‚Äôs.

For us powerusers, Siri Shortcuts are absolutely fucked and Apple Dork
Twitter is livid about it. Personally, I find these to be the least
problematic of the unfixed bugs, and I can only hope it means that Apple
has prioritized fixes for the features most relevant in _your_ life. I
will be updating this Post as actively as I can in the coming weeks and
always appreciate any questions or thoughts you might have about how I
could make it more useful.

image:xhtml/https:/i.snap.as/g95831NO.jpeg[UNIIQU3 - Heartbeats]

By the end of next year, I no doubt will be a card-carrying festival
bro. If you need explanation for why I‚Äôve been listening to _Resident
Advisor_‚Äôs main podcast feed with relative frequency, that‚Äôs it.

I‚Äôd been catching up this afternoon when I came across
http://ra.co/podcast/800[*the big round number 800*] and found it
immediately so compelling that I actually _sought out the associated
interview_, which I needed only skim for less than half a second a
before spotting the words ‚ÄúTechno Is Black.‚Äù (Stylistically, I believe
the _Advisor_ is in error here. TECHNO IS BLACK doesn‚Äôt seem to be in
question.)

https://soundcloud.com/resident-advisor/ra800-uniiqu3

Within the same second, I‚Äôm sure, I saw the words ‚ÄúSpotify playlist‚Äù in
the vicinity of this profound, but unacceptably undercovered truth, and
concluded that I was obligated to take action.

Using a free web tool to associate some metadata across databases is not
activism, mind you, but here‚Äôs what I can do: I will be diligently
minding the origin playlist (on Spotify) for changes and assuring that
they are reflected accurately in the target playlist (on Apple Music.) I
will _not_ be removing any music. I can do this, at the very least.

I have also created handy shortlinks for both the original and the
parallel playlist hosted on my Apple Music profile.

[[section0113.xhtml#gargantuan-ridiculously-avoidable-misses-in-little-blue-s-blue]]
=== Gargantuan, ridiculously avoidable misses in Little Blue‚Äôs Blue.

Incredibly, the second most powerful social media company in the world
has finally managed to implement a paid subscription model, as I‚Äôve been
begging them to do for
https://twitter.com/neoyokel/status/696094018862718976[at least 5
years], now. For three U.S. Dollars a month,
‚Äúhttps://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2021/introducing-twitter-blue[Twitter
Blue]‚Äù is
https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/9/22766286/twitter-blue-subscription-service-scroll-nuzzel-undo-tweets-ad-free-articles-us[now
available] for all United States users. Aside from
https://apple.co/3wVZs3v[a relentless, rude, two and a half hour-long
rant] at two new friends on _End User_, I should confess that I haven‚Äôt
spoken adequately to peers at length about their Twitter use ‚Äì
understandably, busy independent artists don‚Äôt seem to find themsevles
with the spare time to hypothesize methodically about what they might
want from the service, going forward. From the mass of commentary on
Twitter Blue I _was_ able to gather, a resounding sentiment refrains:
_these features should be available to everyone_.

https://open.spotify.com/episode/3VSCTrzf9QN2MjyFMQ930d

Frankly, after all these years, there‚Äôs not all that much to actually
say about the product, itself. Thanks to Spaces, I happened to catch a
chance to ask my favorite sage of late ‚Äì Jason Scott, original creator
of textfiles.com ‚Äì for his thoughts.

‚ÄúWell, I bought it.‚Äù ‚ÄúYeah, same.‚Äù

image:xhtml/https:/i.snap.as/zp5uCNwa.png[Twitter in Jorts Dock, 2021]

Then, we talked for 45 minutes about self-actualization. As I‚Äôve
recently honed my understanding of the significance behind my own
personal extraordinary dependence/investment in this one service, I have
also ‚Äì in parallel, ya might say ‚Äì refined wholly a set of expectations
which I do not ever again expect to be usurped in any way by Twitter,
Incorporated‚Äôs decisions. Believe it not, these thoughts of mine really
_do_ have real potential to add value to your life, especially if you‚Äôre
still reading. The next time you find yourself wondering what Twitter
might do next, try to internalize the utter inanity of that whole
pursuit. Not one second can be concretely spent in that endeavor because
the organization is defined singularly by its outrageous negligence.
They are not villains or demons like
https://github.com/extratone/bigblue[Big Blue] ‚Äì they are through and
through a village of idiots, and no manner of user action can possibly
budge them.

Of course, this new development of mine hasn‚Äôt actually managed to
delivery any peace upon my person. In fact, because it is impossible to
be _constructively_ critical in such a situation, I am one of few I know
who must continue to be critical, anyway, because my livelihood does not
depend on the newsworthiness of my subject matter. I guess I should just
be thankful my ‚Äúmust‚Äù represents so little time-sensitive consequence,
if any, given how long it takes me to finish anything, these days. On
that note, please
https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/14/22778827/twitter-blue-undo-button-paywall-features-paid-free[look
elsewhere] for the bulletpoints‚Ä¶ Come back for at least a second,
though, because this Post _does_ eventually circle around to a handful
of poignant, original comments on the [line-through]*Whats*.

The peeves aren‚Äôt new, but I‚Äôve found my own redundancy within _The
Psalms_ to be less and less‚Ä¶ redundant, if that makes sense. This
company‚Äôs software is bad and its continued prioritization of the two
native mobile applications (neither of which it actually built) over any
other clients for _all_ user considerations is a spectacular tedium to
follow. Its world record breaking inability to understand anything about
how its _whole shit_ fits into the lives of _any_ of its users continues
to astound. My peak irritation about the whole situation, lately, is
that _you fuckers_ continue to discuss alterations to social software,
generally, as if they are _inevitable_ with a sense of complicity I will
_not_ allow. I‚Äôm not going to argue that you‚Äôre _obligated_ to speak up
and out in a labor sense, but beseeching that you *expect more* from
these organizations as a customer, a citizen, and a human being.

For your sake, I've spent the time to break Twitter Blue's offering down
specifically, feature by feature, only because I have yet to see it done
methodically in detail from the tech media sources you'd normally depend
on.

image:xhtml/https:/i.snap.as/SAYPlThr.png[Thread Reader - Twitter Blue
for iOS]

[[section0113.xhtml#thread-reader]]
=== Thread Reader

If I‚Äôm honest, the majority of the discourse I‚Äôve picked up surrounding
Twitter threads in the past few years has been negative. Vaguely,
‚Äúgetting lost‚Äù is something I recall being expressed. Twitter Blue‚Äôs
Thread Reader offers a ‚Äúreader view‚Äù-like experience in three different
font sizes ‚Äì none of which looked particularly optimal, to my eye. If
there‚Äôs anything to say about it, really, it‚Äôs suggest this adjustment
be made more variable, natively, though further adjustment is allowed at
the moment by using `‚åò + =, -, and 0` for those iPhone keyboarders among
you.

image:xhtml/https:/i.snap.as/1ia6xNyv.png[Voice Tweets in Thread Reader

Also, the appearance of non text-only posts (especially Voice Tweets,
which I, alone, continue to use) in this view feels like a bit of an
afterthought.

Blue on iOS]

[[section0113.xhtml#custom-navigation]]
=== Custom Navigation

Intentionally or not, the configuration of Twitter for iOS‚Äô navigation
tabs enabled by Twitter Blue membership is a revelation ‚Äì or it would
be, were it the only viable Twitter client on the platform. It‚Äôs perhaps
the most celebratable feature included in Twitter Blue, if only because
it suggests the Twitter team is finally paying attention to Tweetbot.
(In case you weren‚Äôt aware, I spent a significant amount of time and
words writing about just how valuable Tweetbot is,
https://bilge.world/tweetbot-6-ios-review[earlier this year].)
Unfortunately for Twitter,
https://www.macstories.net/ios/tweetbot-6-6-gets-support-for-creating-polls-limiting-who-can-reply-to-tweets/[Tweetbot‚Äôs
had an incredible year]. The biggest possible miss, here, was adamantly
missed: one _cannot_ customize away the ‚ÄúHome‚Äù timeline from the first
nav bar position, which brings up another huge issue with expecting a
monthly fee for an experience within Twitter‚Äôs iOS app: _persistence_.

https://twitter.com/neoyokel/status/1467393675579871234

In the clip of the Twitter feedback Space embedded above, my second
point of note was that the app had not ‚Äúrandomly logged me out‚Äù in the
seven days I‚Äôd then been subscribed to Twitter Blue. To be clear, this
was referring to the experience of opening the Twitter for iOS app to
the welcome screen instead of where one left off, which has indeed
happened in the interim. The worst bit: after logging back in again, all
one‚Äôs app preferences are reset to their respective defaults. Without a
means of exporting or ‚Äúbacking up‚Äù one‚Äôs settings ‚Äì like say,
https://better.tw[Better Tweetdeck] has ‚Äì this means that one has to
methodically explore every single Settings menu and re-select core
essentials like posting the highest quality possible images, for
instance, all with the knowledge that such a reset could happen again at
any time. Suffice it to say, this is not the sort of quality one expects
from a premium iOS app in 2021.

https://twitter.com/neoyokel/status/1463658007791812608

As you‚Äôll see in the screenshot embedded above, Custom Navigation offers
one a choice of up to 6 tabs from a total of 10, which include
https://github.com/ExtraKeys/keys/issues/31#issuecomment-986184090[some
Bluetooth keyboard shortcut considerations] I suspect you‚Äôll not find
detailed from any other source.

[[section0113.xhtml#bluetooth-keyboard-shortcuts-support]]
==== Bluetooth Keyboard Shortcuts Support

To start, `‚åò + F` will now reliably open the Explore tab and (most of
the time) deliver one‚Äôs cursor directly to its search field. However,
*this only functions when Explore has been selected as one of the bottom
nav tabs*, which really misses out on an opportunity for the shortcut to
be uniquely useful, in my view. Otherwise, `‚åò + 1-6` will open the
bottom tabs you‚Äôve chosen in order, which means ‚Äì brace yourselves ‚Äì
that Twitter Blue‚Äôs Custom Navigation technically includes _configurable
keyboard shortcuts_.

https://twitter.com/neoyokel/status/1467681892468154370

Also notable: when viewing the obligatory Home tab, one can navigate
between their Lists with just the (unmodified) left and right arrow
keys! `‚åò + ,` is now a dependable way of opening the app‚Äôs Settings
menu, `‚åò + \` pulls up the account switcher, `‚åò + =,-,0` manipulates
text size, app-wide. `‚åò + V` will open Tweets from links in one‚Äôs
clipboard from anywhere in the app ‚Äì not a new trick, I don‚Äôt think, but
a clever one. As of this writing,
https://help.twitter.com/en/using-twitter/twitter-ios-app[the
public-facing document of Twitter for iOS‚Äô Bluetooth keyboard shortcuts]
is quite inaccurate. For example, it lists `‚åò + M` as the command to
switch between light and dark mode in the app, which is actually
accomplished with `‚åò + ‚áß + D`.

image:xhtml/https:/i.snap.as/Qfb0rFvf.png[Undo Tweet - Twitter Blue]

[[section0113.xhtml#undo-tweet]]
=== Undo Tweet

Perhaps unlike you, _I_ have never had a problem understanding why
‚Äúeditable‚Äù Tweets will never exist, largely thanks to
https://hyp.is/znp7tEQJEeySOXvhkqI2DQ/bilge.world/eugen-rochko-interview[my
conversation with Eugen Rochko] about implementing editable posts on
Mastodon:

____
That won't happen. There's actually a good reason why they don't do
that. It's simply because you could make a toot about one thing, have
people favorite it and share it, link it from other places, and then
suddenly, it says 'Heil Hitler,' or something.
____

This, actually, is _not_ the reason I found it easy to understand,
though I hope it makes a bit of a sense. It was when Eugen mentioned
(unquoted) Twitter's original design around SMS[^1] that I first vaguely
understood the depth of this limitation in the core architecture of the
service. As far as I understand it, *the method in which a Tweet‚Äôs basic
data is stored does not allow for revision*. It can be deleted or
obfuscated, but never substituted for or replaced.

As I noted all those years ago. *Delete & Re-Draft* ‚Äì the answer
Mastodon integrated natively and third-party social clients have
featured for years ‚Äì makes _a lot_ more sense than straight up ‚Äúeditable
Tweets‚Äù _or_ the chosen answer at the top of Twitter Blue's feature
list,
‚Äúhttps://help.twitter.com/en/using-twitter/twitter-blue-features#undo-tweet[Undo
Tweet].‚Äù

Here's the full text from
https://help.twitter.com/en/using-twitter/twitter-blue-features#undo-tweet[*its
subpage*] in Twitter's documentation:

____
*Undo Tweet* gives you the option to retract a Tweet after you send it,
but before it‚Äôs visible to others on Twitter. It‚Äôs not an edit button,
but a chance to preview and revise your Tweet before it‚Äôs posted for the
world to see. Once the Undo period is over, the Tweet is viewable to
your followers and you can either leave it or delete it, like you
normally would on Twitter.

* Tapping Undo sends you back to the Tweet composer where you can make
changes before posting the Tweet, or deciding not to post at all. You
can also select Send now to skip the Undo Tweet option and post your
tweet immediately.
* You can turn Undo Tweet settings on for all or some of the
https://help.twitter.com/en/using-twitter/twitter-blue-how-to.html#undodifftweets[different
types of Tweets] including Original Tweets, Quote Tweets, threads, and
replies.
* When active, Undo Tweet displays a countdown of the time left until
your default 30-second Tweet Undo period expires, and your Tweet appears

By default, Undo Tweet is turned on for every single post of any kind at
20 seconds' notice. This was my very first change to the default
settings (https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/1459235983174639626[other
than the highlight color and app icon]): I turned it off for Original
Tweets, Replies, and Threads. This makes it tolerable, but still
useless, and honestly, I can think of only one instance in which I used
it for its intended purpose.

=== Longer Videos & Pinned Conversations

The only straight up ‚Äúwe‚Äôll let you take up a bit more bandwidth since
you‚Äôre paying us‚Äù feature addition included with Twitter Blue is its
elongation of the time limit for posted videos from two to ten minutes.
One of very few observations about Twitter Blue I could find from
‚Äúregular‚Äù Twitter Users comes from
https://reddit.com/r/Twitter[r/Twitter] (which is uh‚Ä¶. a mess:)

____
the only reason i got it is because it allows 10 minutes of videos you
can post and since I make content I no longer have to be restrained to
the 2:20 video time on the ‚Äúregular‚Äù Twitter.

I personally feel this post wholeheartedly ‚Äì especially since I‚Äôve
basically committed to single-take video content, personally, yet have
been regularly sharing screencaps on my account. An anecdote I have not
seen mentioned: for videos uploaded directly to Twitter‚Äôs ‚ÄúMedia Studio‚Äù
(a feature to which I have access because of my peak Periscope fame,
years ago,) the two-minute limit still applies. Yet another beautifully
absurd product oversight.

From the screenshot embedded above, it‚Äôs quite obvious that I no longer
use Twitter‚Äôs Direct Messages, but there was a time, many years ago,
when I would have personally appreciated ‚Äú*Pinned Conversations*‚Äù very
much.

[[section0113.xhtml#ad-free-articles]]
=== Ad-Free Articles

As much as I want to unabashedly celebrate the investment Twitter, Inc.
is inexplicably now demonstrating in Lists ‚Äì a feature I‚Äôve
https://bilge.world/twitter-lists[tirelessly advocated for] out of
perceived obscurity ‚Äì with Twitter Blue, there‚Äôs at least one example
which they‚Äôve managed to fuck up such investment. The official list of
publishers participating in Twitter Blue‚Äôs ‚ÄúAd-Free Articles‚Äù rehash of
Scroll is exclusively documented in the from of
https://twitter.com/i/lists/1448014243245150209[@TwitterBlue‚Äôs singular
Twitter List], which makes it conveniently quite difficult to share.
Aside from that anecdote, I have another which is both mostly personal
and yet inexcludable.

The day
https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/5/22711233/scroll-shutting-down-twitter-blue-standalone-subscription-ad-free-article-service[Twitter
acquired Scroll], I had the bizarre, completely unexpected opportunity
to ask Tony Haile ‚Äì Scroll‚Äôs founder, who also played a substantial role
in creating the Ad-Tech Hell it was founded to counter in creating
Chartbeat, some years ago ‚Äì _a question_. I‚Äôd been listening to a
Twitter Space hosted by https://twitter.com/chrismessina[Chris Messina]
and https://twitter.com/brianmcc[Brian McCullough] for _TechMeme_
featuring Haile while I‚Äôd been showering. Somehow, the two ran out of
questions to ask Tony, so they turned to the audience. I requested to
speak and Chris ‚Äì who‚Äôd done so a few times before ‚Äì let me in almost
immediately.

Nude and still very wet, standing in my bathroom, I suddenly found
myself on a call, essentially, with certainly the most interesting media
industry figure of the moment. Chris, who knew me well enough already as
a regular in his Spaces to know my speech often includes long pauses,
said something like ‚Äúquickly.‚Äù I began by bringing back a topic from an
hour before, at least, and noted that Twitter‚Äôs ‚ÄúTips‚Äù feature was no
more than a list of hyperlinks as it stood (it basically still is,)
before (more or less verbatim:)

‚ÄúI just got out of the shower but uh‚Ä¶ I forgot about Tony Haile. (yes,
he was listening directly to the Space and I did say that) ‚Ä¶but I would
ask him to narrate how exactly he got from Chartbeat to Scroll to
Twitter.‚Äù Yes, I spoke of him in the third person even though I could
all but hear him breathing. I then retired from my speaking role, but ‚Äì
from what I could tell, passively listening as I finished getting ready
for some time-sensitive engagement ‚Äì my question basically sustained the
rest of the interview.

This experience, alone, wouldn‚Äôt necessarily be worth mentioning, but
after discovering _The Kansas City Star_ ‚Äì one of the oldest, most
established local mastheads to my home state (Missouri,) to which I
maintain a subscription ‚Äì among the aforelinked List list of
participating publishers in Twitter Blue‚Äôs Ad-Free Articles program, I
reached out to the one _Star_ reporter I know, asking simply if she‚Äôd
heard anything whatsoever about the program from editors or just
ambiently in the newsroom. She had not.

For an explanation, I dug just a bit further and found out the _Stars_‚Äô
corporate owner, McClatchy, had in fact
https://www.niemanlab.org/2020/12/scroll-the-ad-free-news-startup-will-experiment-with-bundled-subscriptions-at-eight-mcclatchy-sites/[‚Äútested‚Äù
a ‚Äúpartnership‚Äù with Scroll before], and appeared to have opted its
whole handful of local American news institutions ‚Äì including the _Star_
‚Äì in again, en masse, to its new, Twitter-owned form.

Before I go on, I should note that one can indeed utilize Ad-Free
articles‚Äô benefit within your preferred web browser, but the process is
very specific. On iOS, you‚Äôll need to open an Ad-Free Article in the
Twitter app first (marked with blue text) and then tap the Safari icon
in the bottom right to open your default browser. You‚Äôll know you‚Äôve
authenticated correctly when you see one of these two motherfuckers[^3]
(depending on your system‚Äôs current light/dark theme setting) in the
bottom right of your browser window:

For thoroughness‚Äô sake, here‚Äôs what
https://help.twitter.com/en/using-twitter/twitter-blue-ad-free-articles[the
official help document] has to say:

____
As long as you stay logged in to Twitter, and use the same browser each
time, you should get ad-free reading when you subsequently visit that
same Twitter Blue site.
____

Have a peak at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Kansas_City_Star[_The
Kansas City Star_‚Äôs Wikipedia page] and you‚Äôll note that it‚Äôs over 150
years old, once claimed Ernest Hemingway on its masthead, has been
awarded eight Pulitzer Prizes, and that it depends on a combination of
advertising dollars and
https://jimmycsays.com/2018/02/13/more-worrisome-circulation-figures-for-the-kansas-city-star/[possibly
in duress] subscription revenue to stay afloat. This in mind, note the
screenshot I‚Äôve embedded below, comparing how a Twitter
Blue-participating _Star_ article appears within a desktop browser ‚Äì
without Twitter Blue vs Twitter Blue.

image:xhtml/https:/i.snap.as/ATS5Q3ok.png[Kansas City Star Twitter Blue
Comparison]

Captures of each respective webpage demonstrate that Twitter Blue
exempts a reader from about half of the content weight of the
non-Blue-authenticated render[^4]. Old school banner ads account for a
portion of the missing content, but at least three elements for
converting visiting readers to paying subscribers make up for most of
it, I‚Äôd wager. None of what‚Äôs gone is content anyone on Earth _wants_ to
see, mind you, but frankly, it‚Äôs disrespectful of the paper‚Äôs
classically villainous,
https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/16/business/media/hedge-fund-chatham-mcclatchy-postmedia-newspapers.html[recently
bankrupt] corporate overloard to opt it in with a program fundamentally
designed to _intentionally forgo advertising engagement_.

Tony Haile, if you‚Äôre reading this, you can exhale now. Yes,
https://help.twitter.com/en/using-twitter/twitter-blue-ad-free-articles[the
_theory_ behind Scroll, and now ‚ÄúAd-Free Articles‚Äù in Twitter Blue],
suggests that the fifteen cents I‚Äôve earned the _Star_ so far (the
graphic above can be found in the ‚ÄúSee Your Impact‚Äù selection within
one‚Äôs Twitter Settings) will be paid directly _to_‚Ä¶ Whom, exactly?

The answer offered by Twitter, Inc. to the question of ‚ÄúHow does my
ad-free reading support journalism?‚Äù (asked of themselves:)

____
Each month, we pay publishers within the Twitter Blue Publishers Network
based on the content you and other Twitter Blue subscribers read ad-free
through Twitter Blue. Our model is designed to help publishers continue
to fund the journalism you love to read.
____

_Publishers_. I suspect that means cash-desperate McClatchy and _not_
_The Kansas City Star_. All to be done at the moment, at least, is to
ask ourselves how much of that cash will ever be seen by the paper.

Blue]

[[section0113.xhtml#bookmark-folders]]
=== Bookmark Folders

Bookmarks and *Bookmark Folders* represent yet further evidence that
someone at Twitter, Inc. _actually uses Twitter_ (or perhaps has a
friend or family member.) Technically, they also represent one of few
core functions exclusive to Twitter‚Äôs own clients. (Consider: Tweetbot
even supports polls, now.) However, like the Thread Reader and ‚ÄúCustom
Themes,‚Äù Bookmark Folders, too, feel like an afterthought shoved in the
bundle an hour before a deadline. Specifically, their color-coded icons
look like placeholders for custom images‚Ä¶ which aren‚Äôt supported, and
they represent 0 additional function as curatorial/archival tools (no
exporting/aggregating/or sorting, even) beyond simply nesting bookmarks
into‚Ä¶ folders.

image:xhtml/https:/i.snap.as/935pp2QS.png[image]

[[section0113.xhtml#icons-themes]]
=== Icons & ‚ÄúThemes‚Äù

Even greater heights of half-assery have been achieved by what Twitter
describes as
‚Äúhttps://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/product/2021/twitter-smarter--twitter-harder-with-twitter-blue[exclusive
app icons and colorful themes].‚Äù Here, I must finally give in and
compare Twitter Blue with Tweetbot directly.

https://twitter.com/neoyokel/status/1467422017527951366

Absolutely zero effort has been expended thus far in recharacterizing
what Web Twitter still calls ‚ÄúColors‚Äù as ‚ÄúThemes,‚Äù and the only
_exclusivity_ in the icon options is that some are seasonal, or
otherwise time-limited, for what possible purpose I cannot conceive.
This from a company of more than 5000 full-time employees.

In contrast, from a full-time team of two ‚Äì both of whom suffered
through bad COVID infections, this year ‚Äì Tweetbot now includes an even
further broadened spectrum of app-wide themes and 19 app icons in total,
including, yes, at least two very cute, limited-time seasonal options.

[[section0113.xhtml#all-users-are-should-be-powerusers]]
=== All Users [line-through]*are* Should Be Powerusers

The episode of _End User_ embedded above is one of the only podcast
episodes I‚Äôve ever made which I actually find _too painful_ to listen
back to[^2], but I still think it‚Äôs valuable. There‚Äôs a specific bit of
the conversation between https://twitter.com/alisonbuki[@alisonbuki] and
I in which the term ‚ÄúPoweruser‚Äù is actually thrown around regarding my
own use of Twitter Lists, Tweetbot, and a few other _Hax_ to consume
content _deliberately_. I think I failed somewhere in my portrayal of
this curation and miscommunicated the nature of what I was trying to get
at by ‚Äúmaking use of the tools available to you.‚Äù Regarding the actual
manhours involved in the configuration I was trying to evangelize, I
think I‚Äôve spent more time trying to describe the effort than I have
actually configuring my own content intake.

Long before I was https://bit.ly/dbfollow[follow-limited] in 2017, I
lived entirely in my [Twitter
Lists]()https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/lists), the largest of which I
built up ‚Äúorganically‚Äù over time, by adding appropriate accounts one by
one as I came across them. Thanks to Tweetbot, my equivalent of the
native apps‚Äôs Home timeline is a private List of ~200 accounts whose
users represent the actual entirety of my adult social life, past to
present. Then, there‚Äôs https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/lists/the-new[The
New], which ‚Äì I must admit ‚Äì has grown beyond its original scope and
sortof become my follow list, with enough exceptions that I consider it
worthwhile to keep public. Then, there‚Äôs the newest ‚Äì
https://twitter.com/i/lists/768458273141907456[my Meta-Media List] ‚Äì and
the very oldest: my dear, weathered
https://twitter.com/i/lists/43457439[Rolodex of Automotive Twitter]. I
keep Tweetbot in my dock and the native app on my device just for
notifications, Spaces, and now Communities. That‚Äôs it! Yet, using this
configuration, I _never_ see content that seriously disturbs, shames,
triggers, or otherwise upsets me beyond reason or expectation[^5], but
am regularly exposed to a relatively diverse palette of perspectives,
and just generally find my consumption/engagement time on the service
meaningfully spent.

The particular amalgamation of truly half-assed user experience features
offered in Twitter Blue lend toward a narrative about this company which
we collectively have continued to fall for literally _dozens_ of times ‚Äì
often in immediate succession ‚Äì throughout the fewer years of its
history: that it _finally_ has a morsel of what _might just become_ a
cohesive vision. Clearly, I am as susceptible to this as anyone
considering how quickly I jumped to celebrating the fact that _finally_,
Twitter had seen the humongous value to be imparted to its userbase by
simply adding basic configurables like custom navigation and especially
refining the essential curatorial tool that is Lists.

Were I still a person who wastes my energy speculating on the real
happenings within Twitter, Inc, though, an entirely different, much more
realistic sounding theory arises after the analysis we‚Äôve trudged
through together in this post: every single item on Twitter Blue‚Äôs
feature list represents the absolute bare minimum resource investment
possible. If I had any money, I‚Äôd go on to bet that
https://twitter.com/jpeguin[Shihab Mehboob] could have built from
scratch every single developmental ‚Äúaddition‚Äù to the iOS app Twitter
Blue includes in a matter of hours, though from experience, I seriously
doubt he‚Äôd ever allow such lackluster work to reach even beta tester‚Äôs
fingers. As far as Ad-Free Articles go, Twitter hasn‚Äôt even bothered to
swap out all the Scroll branding. The fact that _I_ had to surface the
concept of Delete and Re-Draft to Twitter Employee brains for what all
appearances indicate was the first time in that ‚ÄúFeedbackFriday‚Äù Twitter
Space represents a truly sickening lack of effort. No, the story that
aligns much more succinctly in the grander context is that Twitter Blue
just happened to be the first disjointed, scatterbrained subscription
service pitch to finally fall out the rectum of this miraculously bunk
organization, but all you motherfuckers can talk about is Japple Notes
Dorsey walking out, and _what it could mean_.

Since I have now actually been personally and explicitly invited to
share feedback regarding Twitter Blue, I suppose I‚Äôll make some effort
to send them this hyperlink. In that vein, I think I‚Äôll end with some
advice addressed directly to Twitter, Incorporated:

Hey Twitter! If you ever find yourself genuinely interested in selling a
subscription product long term, as a mutual value exchange with your
users, make all of Twitter Blue‚Äôs features available to all users, and
ditch Scroll entirely. Instead of placing the bet on local newspapers
like _The Kansas City Star_, it should be on _you_ to *take the
financial risk yourself, and offer, simply, a completely ad-free Twitter
experience*. That might just be worth $2.99 a month.
