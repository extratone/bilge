Well... that's all I was compelled to write, sober.

Yes, I'm still thinking about *why* I am doing this whole thing, and maybe that's unhealthy. Perhaps I'm blind to my own misdirections, but I've stubbornly retained the belief that I can think and talk my way through everything. The practice (especially when public, like this) is consistently cyclical. If existing as a witness to one who's constantly repeating themselves is as excruciating as I've always found it to be, I apologize. But - as I've mentioned publicly a few times these past few months - it would appear that repeating myself (within reason) actually nets positive in terms of distribution of my conversation.

> *My conversation.*

That's an extraordinarily lucky segue into the other prime component of my recent internal discussions: ***what do I really have to say?*** and precisely **why**, **where**, and **how**?

A year ago (to the day, nearly,) Brent and I semi-ironically watched a bunch of Disney movies from our childhood, and I wrote *the very first* and second works for *Extratone*, entitled "[Stairs, Wiggling](http://bit.ly/wigglecruise)," and "[Johnny Tsunami 6: Separate, But Equal](http://bit.ly/sarahmouth)," respectively.

I think it's possible that they are also the first and second most *entertaining* compositions I'll ever birth, but it's interesting, in retrospect - even in the midst of some very taunt bitterness - my newfound commitment to incubating my emotional functionality was evident in the way I spoke of *Furious 7*. It's relevant to myself and my own personal development, which, clearly, is our primary beat, to this day.

And I'd spent 2015 saying some truly hilarious shit on *Drycast*, *Honk*, and the off-record conversations I had with Brent, in between, but I'd been under the influence ***the entire time**.* During the making of [my Toyota Avalon review](http://bit.ly/selfavalon) - debatably *Honk*'s peak - I was high on adderall, alcohol, and some *very* good cocaine. Brent and I truly became our own, ultra-bitter, highly-exclusive society of *hatred* and maniacal, recklessly loathsome irreverence. I was sharp, witty, and ***utterly miserable***. By early Winter, my grief was *really* gaining ground on me. After hyper-focusing for a month and half getting [*Feebles*](http://bit.ly/Feebles) to print, I ran out of distractions. By late Spring, I'd lost my job and escaped as completely as I could into *Eve Online.* 

And then - in June - I met Eryn, who'd lead me back to Earth, teaching and changing me far more than anyone I've ever encountered.

But that's a story for another time.

I wrote and said a lot in 2015, and most of it's pretty sublime, by my standards, but also *entirely useless. Drycast* was hilarious, yes, but my then-primary means of hysterical spewing really just served up a realization: while some of my arguments were very entertaining and intelligent, *none* were ***relevant***. I'm thankful I managed to be as receptive as I was to the new perspectives from friends old & new that were graciously presented to me while hosting that show, but after it'd spun out, I found myself lamenting the opportunities I'd missed in consistently sacrificing any real depth to the idol of *entertainment*.

I'm pretty convinced that those few months between the [last episode of old *Drycast*](http://bit.ly/drycast54) and *Extratone*'s founding were the worst I will ever experience, mostly because I perceived my future as in *absolute zero* status*.* It was utterly silent, wholly peaceful, and... identical to death, really.

(I recently said something like "*Feebles* was my critique of peace, and *Extratone* is my manifesto against it," but it's also a means of finding and providing an **alternative**, in many ways.)

In the midst, of course, I put many 'a' manhour into *my own poetry collection*, feeding my obsession with revision with a boatload of adderall to a degree that I forgot to continue drinking alcohol. By the time I figured out what the hell my withdrawals were, I thought I'd just hold out the rest of the way to sobriety, leaving myself with my fairly rudimentary publication, and an empty schedule. And it was on Amazon, there, yet I could not sincerely find it within myself to recommend it to potential customers over Rupi Kaur. I missed my tractors and found peculiarity in my waking post-mortem drear, and *so fucking what*.

I can't give you a specific date, but something very profound happened, then, while I was left alone in silence with my exponentially growing fear of death: I realized that **the legacy of an amplifier and shepherd of *relevant* voices was vastly more preferable to one consisting of my voice, alone.**

In my waywardness, I'd been allowing myself my first opportunities to truly recommune with my punk friends from high school, without my blinding adolescent distractions, and I extrapolated from *Feebles* 'silence(peace) = nothing but death' argument, determining *I'm here, and I want to fucking live*, which simply meant existing in the antithesis of death... **NOISE.**

For the first time since Junior High, I began to explore the prospect of *Web Development*. The name 'Extratone' was first or second on my list. The Twitter username was free, and the dot com was up for auction. I won it in early April, and the year, since has unquestionably been **the most significant of my entire life**, to date.

*Thanks, WordPress...........*

***

In sincerity, though, I must (continuously) thank **you**.

If you're still reading, you're more likely than not one of the primary reasons I am still here. 

Heavy stuff, eh?

Till next time,
