I've probably already told some of you one or more of these stories, but
these past few weeks have been more interesting than usual.  
   
 I spent nearly all of today trying to wriggle a [podcast
episode](http://bit.ly/futureland27) out of Audacity (my home machine is
out of action for the moment,) and then... the audio player on the site
kept breaking on every new post. I'm not sure how long I spent trying to
troubleshoot it... 2 hours, probably. I spend way too much time slaving
over tasks I am not adept for, these days, but here's hoping that
changes within the next year.  
   
 Perhaps in stupidity, I've been working on another one of... whatever
it is that I write for [*Words of David Blue in
Red*](http://bit.ly/vilechrist) (the series of ramblings that bred the
obsessive tendencies I started this newsletter to combat) arguing that
the book of Revelation is - in fact - about Facebook. Ultimately, I
think I just wanted an excuse to entitle something ***Mark Fuck***.  
   
 Nonetheless, I'm also including a fairly detailed account of an
entertaining experience I had at work:

I don't know if it's a *joke* or not, but I've always found it amusing
to greet customers with a sometimes-cacophonous "**GOOD MORNING**"
regardless of the actual time-of-day. According to Tevin, a semi-elderly
woman whom I'd subjected to this at \~7PM, a few weeks ago, came up to
him after I'd walked away and remarked "it's so nice that you all hire
retarded people." That's a keeper. I'm surprised my reaction wasn't more
severe, to be honest, but then again... I *am *on *more pills* again!  
   
 Last year, after my pediatrician finally forced me to seek a Big Boy
Doctor, I went to a local family clinic, and was assigned Dr. Fast (not
his real name,) with whom I had an awkward first encounter, for whatever
reason. This second checkup, though, was absolutely hilarious.  
   
 My adderall prescription requires me by law to be seen every three
months. I'm not sure what - if anything - is legally required to
constitute a "checkup," but Dr. Fast literally just pokes my chest over
my shirt with his stethoscope for like... *less than one heartbeat*to
justify the checkup bit, and is totally no-frills for the rest of the
verbal portion.  
   
 I told him I was hoping to go back on Lexapro because I want to be
funny again, and he began entering the script on his laptop before I
even finished my explanation. I also brought up how stressed and scared
I am for the first time in my life, and - I swear to God - his parting
sentiment was "we'll do our best to get you funny and keep you
terrified." The *ideal medical professional *for me, that's for sure.  
   
 I remember having objections to the way Lexapro made me feel, but I
can't quite recall what they were... so I guess I'll just need to
discover them again. Remind me to write them down, this
time.![](../../../gallery.tinyletterapp.com/e8ecb4f78686444d5a5c89d53c49de7c8feb8ac5/images/3659a10a-8fcd-4e8c-a532-9078b7677377.png)I've
been talking about the past a lot. I suppose that's inevitable when one
moves back in to the very house they occupied for the majority of their
incubation.  
   
 When I take one of the numerous breaks from web administration I
require in a work(night,) I often walk the same route I walked to school
in first grade... by the building, in fact. Sometimes, I make use of the
very swing I 'claimed' as mine at recess, from which I'd shout Elvis
songs at my second-grade crush.  
   
 I've been exempt from this place by my own design for the vast majority
of my time, here, and that removal turned out to be quite detrimental
for my development. I guess my captivity here is a penance for my
childhood mistakes, though I don't think that's entirely fair,
considering all my cells have been replaced, since, if science is to be
believed.  
   
 *(Sorry, just practicing for Bible Study.)*  
   
 In the summer of 2015, I met a girl (we're going to call her Brittany,)
who'd been sniped by Amway - a fascinatingly disturbing Christian
pyramid scheme that's managed to thrive more or less under the radar by
convincing society's most desperate people to buy tickets to various
meetings; local weeklies, regional annual conferences, etc.  
   
 She got me to go to a few meetings, sign a few documents, and attend a
few conferences. It was an extraordinarily surreal time. The young woman
I'd grown up with had severed contact with me completely and (more or
less inexplicably) just 6 months before, and the depth of my internal
emptiness was only surpassed by that of my general detachment from
reality. My state of all-consuming apathy was perhaps at its most
inescapable, but the first steady presence of *real insanity* in my life
since I cut off contact with my father provided me a very particular
sort of fundamental wariness, and I savored it.  
   
 I'm not going to tell you there was a single moment when I "figured it
out," because I did *not* care about my use of my time or my wellbeing,
in any sense. I was utterly listless... without volition, but - when I
sat down in that first meeting, squared away in the conference room of
our local, two-star Stoney Creek Hotel - at least enough instinct of
self-preservation had stuck with me to recognize the suspiciousness of
the whole thing.    
   
 Somehow - without spending a dime of my own money - I managed to ride
the wave as far as a new 'IBO' ("Independent Business Owner") can
reach: Summit.  
   
 During the course of that weekend-long event - hosted by the U.S. Bank
Arena in Cincinatti, featuring a very long, very emotional presentation
by Duke University's Coach K - I experienced what I'd guess was the most
uncomfortable I'll ever be in a public setting. It was the zeal, the
constant insistence upon the organization's legitimacy, and the
implications of it all on the 10,000 people who surrounded me.  
   
 Obviously, I'm not all that great at articulating it yet, but I think
I'm emotionally prepared to begin addressing it. Amway is virtually
invisible to the press upon a Google search, which was the most
significant red flag for me, in the beginning. I think I could be the
right one to 'oust' it, but I just want to tell the story of my
experience.   
   
 More will come on the topic when I'm able to craft it more formally. Of
course, don't be afraid to reply to these emails, or contact me
elsewhere.   
   
 Till next time,  
 David
