Hey {.subject}

I'm crazy enough to believe that I can - or must - learn the things
you're supposed to seek from academia by embarking on a journey to start
an online magazine from nothing but an amazing group of people. I have
always been very proud, and it's been tremendously misplaced for most of
my life. But perhaps - with age - I am recognizing the ability to be
proud of something parallel to my efforts to build Extratone. But in
starting this, I am taking the steps to realize something I've needed
for balance: an outside line. \
 \
 Before I continue, I have to make a few promises to you about whatever
future is in these letters:

-   I will not revise them beyond the backspace key (within reason.)
-   I will be as honest and genuine with you as I can be with myself.
-   I will not revisit them after they're sent. 
-   I will not write you out of vanity.
-   I will only write you when I feel like it.
-   I will write you whenever I feel like it. 

There's an obvious common thread, there. I have internalized words as my
function, and my pride has long since turned to obsession over my voice.
It has all but ruined my ability to tell stories. I may ramble. I may
get things very wrong, but I have to learn how to do so, again.\
 \
 I think I'll start with some more intimate works I've been sitting on
for a good while.\
 \
 Until then,\
 David
