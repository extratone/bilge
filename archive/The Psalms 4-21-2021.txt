# 2019 Volkswagen Atlas Review 
## VW's Jumbo new offering is titanic to live with and genuinely amusing to drive, but is it a condescendingGerman prank on America? 
![[2019 Volkwagen Atlas SEL w/4MOTION]](https://i.snap.as/XzLvAnV.jpg) 
Upon meeting an elderly recently immigrated German friend of my mother's for the first time yesterday, sheexclaimed *He looks German!... and so tall!* Both of these compliments were *relatively* true, but certainlynot extremely. I am more German-looking than not, perhaps. Supposedly, I am half a product of a very largefamily whose elders are only one and two generations from German royalty - my legal last name is on astate sign in front of a small black castle somewhere in *Der Vaterland*. I slacked through two years of highschool German language classes - Frau Rosa once took me aside to ask *you’re not going to shoot up theschool or anything, right?* (Sorry Frau & peers.) Though my much-older half siblings grew up mostly in thetown of Schweinfurt, I have never actually set foot in Germany, yet I’ve come to identify with and admire itsculture enough to (perhaps unjustly or inappropriately) feel comfortable joking about Deutsche peculiaritiesas vain self-mockery.

Despite all of this (carefully nationalism-free) affection, the real truth of myself is an American one. I havelong since broached the point of no return: no matter how hard I might try, I would never be able to moldthe Me another perceives in such a way that I’d become observably German-native. I’m just a midwesternboy with a Germanic name on his paperwork, and therefore have more in common with Volkswagen’snewish entry into the *dramatically* different full-size Sport Utility Vehicle segment. The Atlas bears a[remarkably good name](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-11-17/what-s-in-an-suv-name­redemption-with-u-s-consumers-vw-hopes) (annoyingly, [literally everyone's reviews](https://www.thedrive.com/new-cars/9083/the-2018-volkswagen-atlas-finally-solves-vws-america-problem)seem to begin with a comment on how *decipherable* the new name is for Americans) - especially amongnew automotive products introduced to market in recent memory. Honda’s *Clarity* **should** be cleveralongside the definitively 21st-century *Insight* marque, but violates an unfortunately universal law in theindustry: never name a car for a *state of being* (Introducing the New 2020 Honda *Ambiguity*[*Insolence*, *Fugue*, *Debacle*, *Setback*]) ~especially~ one so obtusely irrelevant to the product itself.*Insight* comes from a chat with a colleague over coffee, but *Clarity* is a metaphysical, zealous plane thatsounds our ever-inadequate platitude alarms in a very unsettling manner. *Um... Is Honda doing okay?* Itnot only ends up irritating and off-putting: after Hannah’s season of *The Bachelorette*, it’s just dumb, lazy,and foul. 
> After decades of trying to force Yankees into models that many found too small, VW has figured it out:Big-ass SUVs are what Americans want, and the Atlas is designed around the biggest asses you can imagine. 
In contrast, the fucking Nissan *Kicks* ages so swiftly and uncomfortably that it’s pitifully tacky before iteven hits the lot, which is particularly disappointing considering the most cleverly bestowed *Juke* namewas. One marvels at the situation Nissan has found itself in: *young American black men love our brand, butthey also love shoes!* Atlas, though, is on par with Honda’s *Odyssey* inspirationally, though a smidgemore grounded through the distinctly Earthen science of topography, just as it should be. Originally billed asa replacement for [VW’s Routan minivan](https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/cars/2013/09/23/vw­routan-suv-crossblue/2856593/), the three-row Atlas is Volkswagen’s newest bid for the Panic Room-lovingAmerican parent demographic. Therefore, it’s crucial for us to examine it thoroughly for [any signs ofcondescension](https://www.businessinsider.com/vw-atlas-crossover-suv-review-2017-11) from the Germansand their brand “whose business in the US is built on providing small, fun-to-drive cars like the Golf, theBeetle, the Jetta, and the Passat.” 
> From our perspective, what we have here is a German take on the American family SUV. A Ford Explorer by way of Wolfsburg, if you will. Well, sort of. The Atlas is actually built in Chattanooga, Tennessee alongsidethe Passat sedan. 
Unavoidably, the most notable, remarkable, and extraordinary item to note about the Atlas is simply that **itis fucking fat**. Just about any review you watch or read will mention this. Even *CNET* calls theirs "[a verybroad boy](https://www.cnet.com/roadshow/reviews/2019-volkswagen-atlas-review/)." After I first read thenumber - **5997 lbs.** - I was never able to escape it throughout the entirety of my time with it. ***Threetons*** is unbelievably, inexcusably, violently, hopelessly heavy. *Hopelessly* not because it stands out inits segment, but that [*it does not*](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/457289420174000150/698509904629202996/2017_Vehicles_with_GVW_over_6000_lbs.pdf). Obesity is still a problem in America, but it's our automobiles now. While wecontinue to worship safety and fuel economy together, we skew the triangle (the other side is performance)further and further, and yes – a good portion of the blame can be placed on [our obsession with SUVs](https://www.npr.org/2016/05/09/477301486/why-americans-are-buying-more-trucks-and-suvs-than-cars). Ispent 2018 driving a 1976 Lincoln Continental Mk. IV around - the second-longest two-door car ever sold at
228.1 inches from its pointed nose to its massive ass. Despite being a full *thirty inches longer* than the2019 Atlas, my 460-powered mammoth yacht weighed some 700 pounds *less*, and it was filled with *realwood*. I'm no expert in physics by any means, but I can tell you that every pound has [expounding effects](https://www.nrcan.gc.ca/sites/www.nrcan.gc.ca/files/oee/pdf/transportation/fuel-efficient­technologies/autosmart_factsheet_16_e.pdf) on the energy required to move, turn, and stop a vehicle,which just about sums up the ultimate formula to [pulverize efficiency](https://www.autoblog.com/2009/10/29/greenlings-how-does-weight-affect-a-vehicles-efficiency). When ourfriends at the IIHS say that "fuel economy can be improved without sacrificing safety," they are just...**fundamentally wrong**, (though *technically* correct.) 
I'm not entirely sure why the Atlas weighs so much, but its mass is inevitably a major variable in just aboutevery facet of its experience as a product. The best potential hoot to be had from it as a driving deviceshould be sought by ordering it to shuffle briskly on curving country blacktops in Sport Mode with all theassists (save for lane-keeping) *on*. Not to be too crude, but it's fun to make the fat fucker run. Throughyour ass, you can feel the suspension squirm and struggle to redirect all [266 lb.-ft. of VR6 oomf between 4wheels](https://www.motortrend.com/cars/volkswagen/atlas/2018/2018-volkswagen-atlas-se-long-term­update-1-review/) beneath an entirely separate war against the physics of such top-heavy body roll. 
*Scrambling* is definitely the correct verb. Pleasantly light steering in Comfort Mode (where I'd advise youleave it in virtually any situation) combined with a supple-ish ride from multilink suspension provide a traceof a past luxury sentiment not unlike the energy exhibited by my old Connie through and through. It's allabout the sensation of **power**. Not in the horse sense, but in the satisfaction achieved from themanipulation of maximum mass with minimum effort. Comparatively, the level of actual ego-stroking is ofcourse quite miniscule, and unfortunately, it is the numbness that is most noticeably left over with very littlegain. 
Also unfortunate: I did not end up making the opportunity to truly test whatever offroad capabilities theAtlas may posses in any sort of formalized test. My example came with Hill Descent Control and Hill StartAssist, and I was able to find a small hill just steep enough to [trigger the former](https://youtu.be/REchJ_BD5G0?t=232). I cannot say I'd put my money on the Atlas winning the Dakar as itis, but we now know it can handle wet grass on a mild incline. What about county road gravel? Realistically,these are the two extremes 99% of Atlas' will ever face in their usable service lives. I found an entirely quietsection of back rock road and [walked through the steps](https://youtu.be/REchJ_BD5G0?t=321) to disableall of the traction and stability control assists before stomping on the throttle, but was unable to provoke anysignificant wheelspin. In [an episode of *Autoline After Hours*](https://www.spreaker.com/user/autoline/aah-382-can-the-atlas-lift-volkswagen_3), Michael Loveti (VicePresident, Product Line Mid/Full-Size, Volkswagen Group of America, Inc.) confirms the drivetrain *really is***all-time all-wheel-drive**, (though the dual exhaust ports in the rear are [unfortunately fake](https://youtu.be/wCTUgQ-X4mw?t=395),) and that the Atlas is actually based on [the MQB platform](https://www.motortrend.com/news/explaining-volkswagen-mqb-architecture/), which is astonishing.Prospective buyers should definitely have a listen. 
<iframe src="https://widget.spreaker.com/player?episode_id=17362733&theme=light&autoplay=false&playlist=false" width="100%" height="200px"frameborder="0"></iframe> 
This theme of "thoroughly German, yet somehow distinctly Americanized" occurs [over](https://www.digitaltrends.com/car-reviews/2019-volkswagen-atlas-review) and [over](https://arstechnica.com/cars/2018/04/the-volkswagen-atlas-reviewed-a-peoples-wagon-for-the-american­people/) and [over](https://www.consumerreports.org/suvs/2018-volkswagen-atlas-suv-first-drive-review)and [over](https://youtu.be/wCTUgQ-X4mw?t=444) again in the Atlas' story. Its horizontal lines match boththe Jetta and Ford's Explorer. In that way, surely it is a success. I cannot imagine a better execution of itsmarque's directives as stated by Mr. Loveti than what I drove. 
> Cover the Volkswagen logo and you might think the Atlas was made by someone else. The hard lines andboxy shape are a sharp departure from the rest of the VW lineup. But look at its competitors here in thestates, especially the Ford Explorer. It’s almost like Volkswagen tried to build its own Ford with the Atlas. 
> Even though it has been on the market for only a year, the Atlas had become VW's second-most-popularcar in the German automaker's lineup in March 2018, showing that the American car-buying public's thirst forcrossovers and SUVs remains unslaked. 
### Place in The Segment 
The only other modern SUVs I've spent significant time with was the Range Rover Evoque I crashed and theVW Tiguan I reluctantly borrowed (and had [absolutely nothing](https://twitter.com/search?q="Tiguan"%40neoyokel&src=typed_query&f=live) to say about,) so my authority in comparing the Atlas with itscompetitors is severely lacking. However, I can at least send you the way of *Regular Car Reviews*' [Romanreviewing his mother's Ford Explorer](https://youtu.be/Dij6fkrOSfs), *Business Insider*'s [direct comparisonbetween their long termer Atlas and the Explorer](https://youtu.be/Dij6fkrOSfs), or *Cars.com*'s [vs. thenew Subaru Ascent](https://www.cars.com/articles/subaru-ascent-vs-volkswagen-atlas-the-family-suv-feud­begins-1420700698096/). *Car & Driver* also [compared the Atlas to the intriguing Kia Telluride](https://www.caranddriver.com/reviews/comparison-test/a27354538/2020-kia-telluride-vs-2019-volkswagen­atlas/). 
> In the splitting of already fine hairs, it's the new Telluride that makes a stronger case over the Atlas,thanks to its price advantage, its plush and thoughtful appointments, and its slightly more comfortable third-row. 
## The Passive Safety Fairytale 
**Define**: [Active safety](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_safety) 
**Freedom through security**. In truth, neurotypical people are naturally driven to minimize risk, yet also toromanticize the sick, inhibitionless madmen - to envy them both internally and externally (in a mostrestrained way.) Collectively, our authority in (or mastery of) risktaking remains pathetically irrational. If wewere to itemize our ability to asses risk into a sixth physical sense, it would rank just as poorly against therest of the world's creatures (or perhaps neck-and-neck with those of the squirrel or the deer.) 
So many struggles of the too-often-cited "Human Condition" are grounded in the incompetence of this sense.It shouldn't be surprising, then, that risktakers in general are a very special topic amid The Middle Class ­those who occasionally find themselves atop *just* enough excess to call it "capital." This equates in day-to­day life as only the most potent - yet almost entirely inert next to the cushion of multi-millionaires - subject,catalyst, and indicator of dire fret. By far the most widespread affectation of this petty affliction spreads likedivine wrath over the upper forty percent of this Middle Class. Thus, we must ask ourselves *how safe doththe Atlas make me feel*?

### Inside 
My Atlas’ interior was finished in Titan Black Leatherette, which sounds both grandiose and a bit like a kink."Volkswagen is known for good build quality and tight-feeling interiors," [writes Danny Geraghty](https://www.auto123.com/en/car-reviews/2019-volkswagen-atlas-review/65887/) for *Auto123*, "but Ifound I was encountering just a bit too much hard plastic, making for a somewhat dated feel." Perhaps myloaner was less worn in because neither I nor my girlfriend found anything wrong with the Atlas’ interiorquality – even after bombing gravel roads to the point of sustaining a left-rear puncture, we did notencounter any annoying squeaks or rattles. She spent an entire afternoon sleeping in the passenger’s seatreclined and described it as “comfy.” For [*The Car Connection*](https://www.thecarconnection.com/news/1109777_2018-volkswagen-atlas-first-drive-super-sized), SeniorEditor Andrew Ganz writes: 
> It’s not much to behold, with a chunky shape as conservative as they come that is not offset by a distinctlack of flair inside. Instead, the Atlas is quietly competent and exceptionally good at carrying seven humans—even seven adults. 
Standard with the SEL trim is Volkswagen’s “Digital Cockpit” instrument panel, which I like much more than Iexpected to, though its color options are already dated and [unfortunately unchangeable](https://www.periscope.tv/AsphaltApostle/1nAKEZmYpQOGL?t=4m12s). Ageability is an inevitable issue withthese sorts of bespoke graphic design decisions automakers are making now, but at least you’ll be able totell your friends that your Volkswagen has a digital dashboard “just like the Rolls-Royce Phantom,” which is,of course, the ultimate Queen of timelessness in the industry. Perhaps it’s telling that the only layout I foundacceptable for the digital dash was the one with simulated analog needles for the tach and speedo, and howoften do you *really* use a compass in day-to-day driving? For that matter, how useful could a digitalcompass in the speedometer’s center hub really be in an “offroad” situation? It’s a bit petty, but I also reallydespise the typeface shared across the instruments and infotainment system. It’s just… bad.

### Outside 
In Platinum Gray Metallic, the Atlas looks authoritative enough in a very ordinary way. Unless you’re on thelookout for one, you’d hardly notice it, and you certainly wouldn’t expect what you see to cost as much as itdoes. That is why I’d prefer *any* one of the [other exterior finishes](https://web.archive.org/save/https:/www.elginvw.com/blog/what-colors-does-the-2019-volkswagen-atlas­come-in/), especially (in order): Pure White, Tourmaline Blue Metallic, Pacific Blue Metallic, and Fortana Red.The real wonder is how VW managed to execute a seven-seat SUV with its existing design language. Thoughthe Atlas is by far Volkswagen’s largest vehicle, it fits neatly within their lineup.

## Road Rage 
My only authentic Road Rage experience in some 5000 miles of rideshare driving occurred on All Hallow'sEve when I stopped - no more illegally than usual - on the opposite corner from a popular downtownMexican restaurant called The Nap with hazards and all courtesy interior lights shining. The car immediatelybehind me hesitated no more than necessary, but the Biggest Big Infiniti behind them (a QX80 - the Atlas'competitor) just... stopped. There was honking and frenzied, hoarse screaming of *what the fuck are youdoing?* and such. 
I responded with pleasantly amused but relatively-encouraging glances at the impersonal black mass of theInfiniti's windshield through my mirrors. I rolled down the Atlas' driver's side window and politely gesturedthat they go around me, but failed to coax any movement whatsoever from the ugly behemoth through atleast two full cycles of the nearby traffic light. There must be some aquatic authority in the bulbous black assof the QX80, for no one behind it seemed willing to pass either. The driver waited significantly longer than you'd imagine before emerging, huffy. She was wearing a classic poofy black North Face vest some sort ofslate gray turtleneck. Nothing below these were stimulating enough to retain any memory of. *Uggs?* 
How positive are *you* that the truth has absolutely zero consequence: contrasted silver-beige eyeliner andlittle eye contact, dirty-ish straight blonde hair over a spray-tanned face, exhibiting zero anxious tics orhesitation. She was obviously the New Matriarch, and she was obviously *much* more of an authority ontraffic law than I. As she approached, she scanned the street as one naturally does when they enter a busyone... except it was completely empty, thanks to her blockade. She first informed me that I was "not*supposed*" to be stopped there. I tried to listen and respond with as much sincerity as possible as Irealized all at once that my behavior had genuinely *perturbed* this woman - that her choice to leave thehuge hideous warmth of the guppy wagon to speak as humans to one another required great courage. 
![2019 Volkwagen Atlas SEL w/4MOTION and Prius-C](https://i.snap.as/ZATOFIE.jpg) 
I inserted the next logical question which I'd been screaming telepathically: *can you not get around me?* Ibegan to pity her when I then saw in her face the distinct possibility that *going around* as a concept hadnot occurred to her whatsoever. She stuttered a wee bit in retorting "I could go around, but I don't want toget a ticket." Here, one of the most fascinating avenues of suburban psychology is explored: Guppy Mom isnot being ingenuine with this expression, nor has she had an untoward experience with law enforcement,ever. Guppy Mom did know her excuse was bullshit - nobody has ever been written a traffic citation forcarefully circumventing an obstacle in the road. Given the opportunity to interrogate this kernel of entirelyuncompromising obedience to utterly delusional traffic law superstitions, I think we'd simply discover a life ofunnaturally positive interactions with LEOs. We must conclude, then, that the source of her fear was eithermyself or the Atlas. 
Granted, to her I am still a *Young Man*, and am therefore instinctively programmed to believe myself moreinformed than literally everyone - even the very foundational architects of modern civilization. Her StuccoHighness may have felt a representative of these builders (edgy take: *she is in fact their servant*.) Herown folks surely complain regularly about their distaste for disrespect, and my gig-economy, Austin Powers-looking ass was somehow disrespecting the order laid down by her would be (entirely fantastical)forefathers. Though her expression of her quaint fear of such "ugliness" (if you will) is hard-headed, anugliest decision of hers (or her kin) idled behind me, its giant seafood-looking mouth gaping, unhinged. It'dalmost be more redeemable if it was a hardcore, chronic mouthbreather. (The QX80 is actually [powered bya comparatively oldschool V8](https://www.autoguide.com/auto-news/2019/05/2019-infiniti-qx80-pros-and­cons.html).) 
Freedom from fear is the sum desire of all the most primitive compulsions we share. Ultimately, the onlyefficient and reasonable response to Mrs. Guppy's kind in such a situation is to very kindly oblige, which Idid, of course, with great respect and great pity. In the months since this encounter, I'd been wonderingwhat was missing from the outline of this Atlas review. I recently realized that it is this analysis of fear as afactor for the American carbuyer. 
Though it has been disproven over and over again for [decades](http://www.accessmagazine.org/wp­content/uploads/sites/7/2016/07/access21-01-are-suvs-really-safer-than-cars.pdf), consumers often cite*safety* as their primary motivation for buying full-sized SUVs. Mrs. Guppy's Great Guffaw led me to realizewhy this particularly disconnected supposition/folktale continues to thrive so uninhibited by the truth: the*brand image*, physical presence, and actual driving sensation must communicate and "feel" **safe** ­these are far more integral to buyers' perception of a product than the testable reality. Even the people ofthe [world's most Christian nation](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/04/01/the-countries-with­the-10-largest-christian-populations-and-the-10-largest-muslim-populations/) do not have faith - they trustnot unless they see with their own eyes; feel with their own asses. They entrust their souls to the Word ofthe Lord, but not their lives to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. (I recently gave both ofmine to NHTSA for All Eternity.) 
![2019 Volkwagen Atlas SEL w/4MOTION](https://i.snap.as/63zglSP.jpg) 
### The Collegiate Take 
The two or three nights I spent Uber/Lyft driving around my college town shuttling Halloween party traffic inthe Atlas were expectedly uneventful. I had to create a preset text message to send immediately uponconnection with a rider to communicate as succinctly as possible that I was *not* going to be arriving in theJetta Sportwagen on my profile but instead in the Atlas, and to transparently try to make sure that was okay.(No, drivers are not supposed to do this and you should reserve the right to bail on a ride should you findyourself opposite my own position in this situation because nobody refused me.) 
> Hello! Just a heads up: My Jetta is in the shop so I'm driving a **gray 2019 Volkswagen Atlas**> > (It's VW's largest SUV and has 7 seats.)> > License: **FATLAS** > > If this is inconvenient or uncomfortable for you, please let me know. > > Thank you! 
I made a point to try and ask most of the riders if they had any thoughts on the Atlas without sounding like Iwas just desperately fishing for compliments on my own car, but I don't remember any significant thoughtsbeing imparted whatsoever - certainly nothing negative. Folks here are just too polite - they won't speak upno matter how many times you insist that you *do not own the car*. We experienced this phenomena yearsago when we tried to [interview people on the street](https://youtu.be/MLYdky3BKa4?t=443) regarding thehorrid Nissan Murano CrossCabriolet. Regardless, there's no reason to expect young people to have anythingto say about the Atlas - it is neither extraordinary nor cheap. 
If you are an American carbuyer, you might give a shit about the sort of awards manufacturers love to quotein their television commercials like [the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety's "TOP SAFETY PICK,"](https://web.archive.org/web/20180108051011/http:/www.iihs.org/iihs/news/desktopnews/new-volkswagen­suv-earns-2017-top-safety-pick-award) which the Atlas won for 2017. For 2019, it won [*MotorWeek*'s BestLarge Utility Driver's Choice award](https://media.vw.com/en-us/releases/1123). How about [*Cars.com*'s2020 Family Car of The Year](https://www.cars.com/awards/2020/family-car-of-the-year/)? How quickly canthis story turn into [churnalized](https://www.torquenews.com/3769/second-year-vw-atlas-wins-motorweek­suv-award) commercial copy? From Scott Keogh, Volkswagen Group America CEO: 
> [Atlas] was designed and built specifically for American families, and buyers and critics alike are letting usknow that we’re hitting the mark with this seven-seater SUV. 
It's immediately evident from the outside that the Atlas is the most Americanized product in Volkswagen'slineup - indeed, [in its entire history](https://www.thedrive.com/new-cars/9083/the-2018-volkswagen-atlas­finally-solves-vws-america-problem). For [*Car Magazine*'s review](https://www.carmagazine.co.uk/car­reviews/volkswagen/vw-atlas-2017-review/), Ben Barry notes "the square-jawed front, Jeep-like wheelarches, and the suggestive utilitarianism of the stampings in the bonnet and roof" before remarking on [justhow much more you can spend](https://www.vw.com/builder/tab/trim/model/touareg/) on the PorscheCayenne's cousin, the beloved Touareg. 
> Ultimately, the Atlas is far from a dynamic, agile machine, but it feels comfortable and unintimidating todrive, and perfectly at home on US city streets and the slower-paced driving of California highways.

## Efficiency, the Other Fixation 
Surprisingly, the Atlas carries a rare and precious jewel of automotive history under its broad, satisfyinghood. The VR6 "zig zag" arrangement is actually one of [Volkswagen legend] 
(https://www.roadandtrack.com/car-culture/a9988768/volkswagen-vr6-dying/) - defining icons like theCorrado. As [Dan Prosser explains for *Evo* magazine](https://www.evo.co.uk/volkswagen/corrado): 
> ‘VR’ stands for V-Reihenmotor, which translates to V-Inline, describing both vee and inline cylinder layouts.That is, of course, contradictory. The unit is actually a very narrow-angle V6, displacing 2861cc, with twooffset banks of cylinders at 15 degrees to one another. Unlike a conventional V6, but exactly like an inlinesix, there’s just one cylinder head. The result is a six-cylinder engine that’s both much narrower than atypical V6 and shorter than a straight six. In fact, it’s more comparable in size to a four-cylinder than a six,which meant it could slot easily into a Golf floorpan. A creative and borderline ingenious engineeringsolution. 
The Atlas' 3.6L VR6 makes 276 hp and 266 lb-ft. of torque. Though [other reviews](https://www.motortrend.com/cars/volkswagen/atlas/2018/2018-volkswagen-atlas-se-long-term-update-3­review/) cited highway mileage figures of 23-25 mpg, I was able to coax a whole *twenty-eight* miles-per­gallon on a [live Periscope stream](https://www.pscp.tv/AsphaltApostle/1MnxnEBYwgdJO) without airconditioning or cruise control through a two-way simulated 20 minute commute, through which I suffered forthe hard data. My average before resetting the odometer for that feat, though, was 14.7mpg. "Good rangeand miles between trips to the gas station are criteria I look for in a good car, and the fuel-gulping Atlasrates low in this department" may be the blandest statement of all time, but *MotorTrend* does have apoint – with the same 18.6 gallon fuel tank shared between the four and six cylinder models, the latterrealistically has 250 miles of range between fillups, which is pitiful for a modern vehicle in just about anysegment. [Crossing one State](https://goo.gl/maps/cW8GwjGNRhnffo2Y9) is not enough.

## An Attempted Conclusion 
So, is the Atlas indeed just a lucrative German prank on Americans? If it is, the subtleties are beyond evenme. In the time since I drove the Atlas last year, [Volkswagen has unleashed](https://www.caranddriver.com/reviews/a31215717/2020-vw-atlas-cross-sport-drive/) the Atlas Cross Sporton American roads. Apparently, it is [the ideal SUV for "dual incomes, no kids](https://www.autoweek.com/drives/a31151883/the-2020-volkswagen-atlas-cross-sport-is-the-suv-for­dinks/)," or "DINKS" (surprisingly, not a homophobic slur.) *MotorTrend*, on the other hand, argues theideal buyer has "[teenagers who are growing faster than dandelions](https://www.motortrend.com/cars/volkswagen/atlas-cross-sport/2020/2020-volkswagen-atlas-cross-sport­interior-review/)." 
> It's a straightforward conversion from Atlas to Atlas Cross Sport. In the name of perceived sportiness, outgoes that most minivan of things: the third row of seats. 
Normally, I'd be disgusted with such a thing, but from where I'm sitting, the Cross Sport *appears* to bewhat the Atlas should've been all along. The third row seats in my example wasn't any more comfortablethan that of a 10-year-old minivan, so removing them for the sake of the second makes perfect sense. 
According to *Car & Driver*, [the 2021 Atlas will "adopt" the Cross Sport's styling](https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a30186943/vw-atlas-2021-preview/), though there are sometechnologies - like road sign recognition- which are [exclusive to the Cross Sport](https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a29105149/vw-atlas-cross-sport-2020-tech-features/). 
> Instead of getting 20.6 cubic feet of cargo space behind the third row in the Atlas, you get 40.3 behindthe second row. Fold that down and it becomes 77.8 cubic feet to work with. And that’s from an SUV with the same wheelbase as the upcoming 2021 Atlas at 117.3 inches, yet it is 5.2 inches shorter and 2.2 incheslower to the ground. 
There was even a [one-off concept Atlas pickup called the Tanorak](https://www.autocar.co.uk/car­news/new-cars/first-drive-volkswagen-atlas-tanoak-pick-concept), and no one seems to yet know whether ornot it (or something similar) will be put into production. As far as longevity and extended livability isconcerned, enough time has passed since the Atlas' release for long-termer conclusion posts to be publishedfrom the likes of [*Car & Driver*](https://www.caranddriver.com/reviews/a26897709/2019-volkswagen­atlas-reliability-maintenance/), [*Cars.com*](https://www.cars.com/articles/2018-volkswagen-atlas-road­trip-kansas-city-here-we-come-1420702979148/), and [*MotorTrend*](https://www.motortrend.com/cars/volkswagen/atlas/2018/2018-volkswagen-atlas-se-long-term-verdict/).The last of these reported an [odd turning radius issue](https://www.motortrend.com/cars/volkswagen/atlas/2018/2018-volkswagen-atlas-se-long-term-update-4­review/) which was eventually [fixed by Volkswagen](https://www.motortrend.com/cars/volkswagen/atlas/2018/2018-volkswagen-atlas-se-long-term-update-5­review/). 
> Once we got the steering fixed, my opinion of the Atlas did grow sunnier, though it's still not perfect.Maybe it's not fair to compare the driving experience to my previous long-term vehicle, the slightly smallerMazda CX-9, but in my opinion the Mazda still sets the ride and handling bar for the competitive set. Settingthe Mazda aside, if you hop behind the wheel of one of the newer competitors like the Kia Telluride, there'sa noticeable disparity in the refinement in ride quality and body control in the Atlas... **Volkswagen shouldhave made the GTI of three-row SUVs, not just another minivan alternative**. 
This pullquote from [Andrew Ganz’s *The Car Connection* review](https://www.thecarconnection.com/overview/volkswagen_atlas_2018) is as good a summary as I could evercome up with: 
> The 2018 Volkswagen Atlas does little wrong, but it's light on personality and a little low-rent inside—andit guzzles fuel. It's worth a look, but mostly rivals do more for less. 
Volkswagen’s first substantial entry into the SUV market is well-named, relatively well-endowed, fairly blandfor its price tag, and very, very heavy. Also, Start/Stop is still unbearable – thanks Obama – but the Atlas isnot a scam.

> Volkswagen traditionally tuned its suspensions closer to the European ideal, firm but well-damped, whichincidentally made even non-enthusiast Volkswagens more pleasant than average to drive (with a few recentexceptions). But Volkswagen made a conscious decision to soften up the Jetta for American tastes, beyondwhat softening Volkswagen traditionally applied, and it seems like this philosophy scaled up to the muchlarger Atlas. Maybe the soft ride impresses on test drives, but a firmer setup would likely make life nicer foroccupants over the long haul.

## Spring 
The earliest archive.org capture of this particular Writeas blog dates back only to [May 1st of this year](http://bit.ly/psalmsarchive1), but its stylistic contrast with the site's current version is immense. I believe Iwas using [Max Henderson's Anxiety theme](https://write.as/themes/anxiety) virtually stock, albeit withsome color rearrangements. By the [29th](http://bit.ly/3q1d7BM), I had already arrived upon the colors yousee today. "[You Know I'm Blogging](https://bilge.world/you-know-im-blogging)" was just a meta update tosay *howdy* after such a long drought, but "[Dirty Dave's Poweruser Tips](https://bilge.world/poweruser­tips-software-shortcuts)" actually proved popular (for me) among my newly-connected Fedi crowd,especially, thanks to [an annotated share by Writeas on Twitter](https://twitter.com/writeas__/status/1252704432497836034). Honestly, it was entirely worth it just for theaccomplishment of [exposing my platform peer Dino Bansigan to **Alt+D**](https://journal.dinobansigan.com/dirty-daves-poweruser-tips-david-blue). Writeas Community Manager CJEller and I began corresponding, which led to [an interview](https://write.as/community/chat-with-david­blue) regarding writing tools, managing fiddly compulsions, and the wonder of Markdown. 
> I think I'm just now coming around to understanding personal blogging and the freedom that entails. It'sbeen a long while since I've had the urge to write about things on which I don't consider myself at leastsomewhat of an authority. I think – like many people – I originally just used my personal blog as a guineapig for messing around with themes, and I'm just now actually catching up on some of the lesser items onmy “to-write” list. 
I dug deep in my long-overdue todo lis for "[Z..a. .lg. o. .G.. e. n. .è.r. a.. t.o.r. for iOS](https://bilge.world/zalgo-generator­ios-app-review)," which - along with [my 2018 review of Unichar](https://bilge.world/unichar-for-ios-app­review) - I felt was a necessary celebration of digital text as a weapon, which is very dear to me. "[PreferredWriting Instruments](https://bilge.world/preferred-writing-instruments)" was probably the singular analogdeparture *The Psalms* will ever see and my condensed commentary on [*Star Trek: Picard*](https://bilge.world/star-trek-picard-review), [*Star Trek: Discovery*](https://bilge.world/star-trek-discovery­review), and [the current state of *Star Trek: Online*](https://bilge.world/star-trek-online) should fulfill allneed mention of science fiction, here, for a very long time. Given [yesterday's news regarding Slack'sacquisition](https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/1/21719666/salesforce-slack-acquisition-purchase­announced), perhaps I should feel revalidated in my insistence that "[Discord is Better Than Slack](https://bilge.world/discord-slack-comparison)," but a developer friend of mine actually addressed mycuriosity regarding why startups never mention Discord as a workplace option, despite its identicalfunctionality: it's all about fuckin' *enterprise security*. 
I had wanted to write about [*The Langoliers*](https://letterboxd.com/film/the-langoliers/) - Stephen King'sflop of a made-for-TV movie/extended *Twilight Zone* episode - for a long while. It was probably the firstprogram I watched as a child that genuinely disturbed me and always returns to my thoughts by barren-ish experiences. I had planned to watch the whole three hours all the way through and write whatever came tomind, but I only made it halfway or so in "[Craig Toomey's Coronavirus](https://bilge.world/the-langoliers­stephen-king)" before I ran completely out of steam. I dropped what I had without revision, to this day.Perhaps one day I shall return... 
> In the right hour, the woodland springtime metamorphic processes of the neighboring Lake Genevasuburb’s in-betweens were in a paused state – the toads again hushed; the crickets tired, and the humanpopulace, too. In the right hour, the fickle wind and the social owls were the only sound, and nothing movedbut the sparse, light-footed doe in careful segments with her fawn. 
These two sentences begin the sixth chapter of my indefinitely-postponed novel, [*Blimp's Burden*](https://github.com/extratone/pith), and are almost certainly my best writing, ever. My vanity simplywouldn't allow them to go forgotten, so I [published the chapter as an excerpt on *The Psalms*](https://bilge.world/blimps-burden-chapter-6). It may seem an intimidating wall of text, but give it yourattention and you'll be amused, I think. 
![The Psalms Stats by Post - 2020](https://i.snap.as/W3crmS2L.png) 
## Summer 
The general, distinctly 21st-century wisdom regarding one's content popularity seems to be something like*you never know what's going to blow up*. I experienced this phenomena quite severely for the first time inmy writing life after posting "[Google Is Not God of The Web](https://bilge.world/google-page-experience)"on [HackerNews](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23383548) right before going out-of-touch forsome 13 straight hours amidst a local BLM protest. I did not intend to write a baity title, nor did I expectanything to come of sharing it, there - I only did so simply because the thought crossed my mind. Honestly,it is probably the least-considered content I'd ever published on *The Psalms* - I only put it up when I didbecause I knew *all* of my energy was about to be absorbed for an entire weekend or more. I only startedthe thing because I felt it important to raise a small voice in reminder that tech media had started usinglanguage when discussing code/online development which had begun to assume the existence of a single,objective standard of measure for *good web design*. (Fuck your bootstrap baloney, [*The DrywallWebsite*](https://iowa.neocities.org/test) was a *real* *paradigm shit*.) 
And yet... That single goddamned post would end up accruing more pageviews than all of my writing on theweb, combined (I suspect.) Tens of thousands of words were written in hundreds of comments, which I didmy best to parse in [a *for the hell of it* substack email](https://davidblue.substack.com/p/witness-google­god-and-local-history): 
> Out of everything I’ve shared on *Bilge* recently, it’s hilarious that this particular post - on which I spenta cumulative total of perhaps 25 minutes writing and made less effort than ever to edit - became probablymy most widely-shared work of all time. 
Once again, I *am* thankful for the readership and correspondence, I just *really fucking wish* it had beenon literally *anything* else I've written about technology. 
In retrospect, it really is bonkers that I was excited about yet another vague promise to *re-imagine email*in the days surrounding [the launch of Basecamp's HEY](https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/15/21286466/hey-email-basecamp-price-availability-platforms-launch),but I feel it's important to nurture what paltry genuine enthusiasm remains about technology and the future,so I decided to respond to the service's homepage prompt, asking interested visitors to write in with theirown thoughts on email. I spent a morning clacking out "[Email and I: An Abridged History](https://bilge.world/hey-email-history)," which I hope will one day serve as a part-foundation for a thorough,composed extension to my [*Why I Write About Technology*](https://gist.github.com/extratone/91ebe16b0c620f309e70b40f5d4dcd9e) series. This would be *ThePsalms* last relevant work for a few months, while I played around with [an experimental WordPresswebsite](https://www.davidblue.wtf/wordpress-experimentation/) and dove into [*fuckin' school*](https://www.davidblue.wtf/college-return/) for the first time in seven years. 
![WTF](https://i.snap.as/cwm5gKqi.png) ## Fall 
I returned in late September with a partial recount of what I'd discovered: "[Indulging Once More in DigitalExcess](https://bilge.world/digital-excess)." After exploring the concept of [*Digital Gardens*](https://tomcritchlow.com/blogchains/digital-gardens/), buying [my first pro-ready desktop PC](https://www.davidblue.wtf/hp-envy-desktop/) in 10 years, playing with Big Boy Adobe software for the firsttime, and reading [a delightful book](https://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674417076)documenting the history of word processing, I arrived upon the term *Software Historian* with which topartially describe myself. It doesn't mean all that much at the moment, but will no doubt be exploredimminently on this Web Site. 
Addressing "[The Social Dilemma's Dilemma](https://bilge.world/the-social-dilemma)" and "[SoftwareThanksgiving](https://bilge.world/big-thank)" in detail would be awfully redundant, but I would at least notehow they represent diametrically opposed perspectives through which to discuss this stuff. Going forwardinto 2021, I think it's important that I hold short on the progress I've made in moderating my voice since2018. *Digestibility* is not a virtue I am at all interested in, nor is it an appropriate one in which to investany more effort. Any non-*radical* argument will inevitably prove enormously unoriginal, which makes for ahuge waste of all our time. For the moment, that's all the editorializing I've done. 
![Blogging vs.](https://i.snap.as/T4Z1w1nI.jpg) 
## Three Point Oh 
Somewhere along the research process for one of my school essays, I came across the concept of academic[revision tracking and peer review via Git](https://www.davidblue.wtf/git-peer-review/). Having dipped mytoe back in academia, any such circumvention of its penchant for the most archaic practices possible wasnaturally intriguing. *Just wait until I show these goons how to use hyperlinks.* Perhaps inevitably, I waslaunched into the Git-Gone Bender I'm still riding simply because I finally had ample reason to actuallyunderstand it. In just two months, I've created and forked a total of nearly 80 repositories on [my newGitHub account](https://github.com/extratone). Though I'd created one for each of my web properties agesago, I had absolutely no idea how to actually make use of them, so they were all quickly abandoned. In thepast two weeks or so, I think I've actually begun to get the hang of the system's core intricacies, bestexemplified by [*The Psalms*' Repository](https://github.com/extratone/bilge) as it stands. 
The "automated" [Project Board](https://github.com/extratone/bilge/projects/1) I set up has so far been avery impressive replacement for the simple todo list. It tracks and categorizes Post Ideas in their variousstages in my process: Mulling, Documentation (research,) Drafting, and actual Publication. Technical "[Issues](https://github.com/extratone/bilge/issues)" regarding the CMS and/or the Repository, itself, havealso fit in these categories well, so far. Just today, I discovered that one can simply tag Issues by theirnumber to describe [Commits](https://github.com/extratone/bilge/commits/main), which form an impressiverevision-tracking changelog when aggregated together. I also figured out the general idea behind Milestonesand set [*The Psalms*' first one](https://github.com/extratone/bilge/milestone/1) for my 27th birthday, nextmonth. The goal is to have figured this all out well enough by then that I'm no longer randomly stumblingupon entire featuresets multiple times in a workday. [*Thinking in Public*](https://tomcritchlow.com/2020/07/23/thinking-in-public/) - as my friend Tom Critchlow and his crowd say ­is what I'm trying to do here, I think. Obviously, this really means that you are more than welcome to hopthe fuck in at any time, in any manner you'd prefer. If Git is still no more than a conundrum for you - as itwas for me just weeks ago - I would suggest the directory for [In-Progress Drafts](https://github.com/extratone/bilge/tree/main/Drafts) as a starting point. 
https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/1336374708753797123 
[GitHub Actions](https://github.com/extratone/bilge/actions) are still more or less a mystery to me, but I amunbothered - *The Psalms*' seems to be producing green text instead of red, now, in the midst of whatever I set it up to do. I poked around the livestreams for "GitHub Universe" a few weeks ago, when dark modeand GitHub Discussions were opened up to more users. At the moment, I cannot imagine a single applicationfor forums in the context of my blog's repository, but [I turned them on, anyway](https://github.com/extratone/bilge/discussions). It's very possible that all of the documentation-generatingfunctions of Git are entirely unnecessary in this case, but - as I entrust GitHub with the eternal task ofarchiving such work - it is my hope that it will help me add further structure to my process.

If you've found yourself in possession of a .edu email address and are interested in GitHub relatedexperimentation, see [this list of discounted/free dev programs/services for students](https://education.github.com/pack/offers), which includes a free subscription to "GitHub Pro." (Apparently,equivalent to a $4/month service.) Adobe has [similar discounts](https://www.adobe.com/creativecloud/buy/students.html), as you’re probably already aware, which haveallowed me to pursue my goal of learning InDesign. So far, I’ve created a sort of [commemorative 404 pagefor *The Drynet*](https://www.behance.net/gallery/104230341/Four-Oh-Four) and a [font showcase ofGeorgia](https://www.behance.net/gallery/104229721/Moms-Georgia-Type-Specimen) for my mother. Asmuch as I’d love to continue discussing the current state of Adobe apps, I’ve realized 1) I am quite distinctfrom a *professional user*, which is why I genuinely find GIMP more useful than Photoshop, for instance,and 2) given the length of my to-write list considering my current pace, I don’t know if I’d manage to getaround to it in this lifetime.

Between now and the 11th of this month, I will be migrating worthwhile posts from the experimentalWordPress site (WTF) here and closing its hosting account. I haven’t been compelled to actually do anythingwith it in months, and the handy redirects, alone, are not worth the upcosts, however fair. Some content ­including the corresponding posts for my Adobe experiments *will not* be imported from WTF here. I’m alsogoing to rely on [the Web Archive](https://bit.ly/39VJ2y6) for publishing the rest. Notable discoveries so farinclude “[Through an iPhone 4’s Lens](https://bilge.world/iphone4-photography),” which is a reminder ofhow revolutionary that particular handset was, and a few extra-Psalms pieces of content I’d like you toexperience, like [this Notion gallery](https://www.notion.so/rotund/7f4664a737d1429eb94d33cb3486e9e0?v=aad96df288034d2dbe4dd667d6b7f543) of my single jaunt into drawing, [# DavidBlueDraws](https://twitter.com/hashtag/davidbluedraws).

## Coming Soon 
For better or worse, all of these new exploratory avenues have so far led directly away from the business of*actually writing*, but - in my best self-estimation - I suspect I’m mostly done with fiddling, now, and readyto start thinking on the page, again. Predictably, I’ve let my upcoming [iPhone 12 Pro Max Review](https://github.com/extratone/bilge/issues/45) turn into quite a monstrosity over the past two months. Itturns out, years of lapsed attention toward iOS development resulted in my feeling more out-of-the-loopthan I expected, which I was compelled to remedy, naturally. If you’re so inclined, you can follow theminutia attached to my review process via [this dedicated Snapas gallery](https://snap.as/extratone/iphone­12-pro-max), [this shared iCloud album](https://bit.ly/12bbbp), my [personal YouTube channel](http://bit.ly/psalmsyt) , and [this Twitter collection](https://bit.ly/ip12pmtw). 
https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/1344555610155712512 
As per my newfound use of GitHub, I’ve played around with various ways of documenting this journey,specifically. First is [this Wiki page](https://github.com/extratone/bilge/wiki/David-Blue-on-iPhone-&-iOS)(which I shall do my best to remember to keep updated) listing the entirety of my writing history on iPhoneand iOS. (It’s uh... A bit underwhelming, if I’m honest.) I’ve also just begun a [dedicated repository](https://github.com/extratone/i) for iOS-related documentation and resources, which will soon include a full,sensically-indexed list of iCloud share links to my entire Siri Shortcuts collection (I hope.) Immediatelyfollowing the review, I intend to publish here a post [dedicated to functions Apple has failed to properlydocument](https://github.com/extratone/bilge/issues/56), which I expect to be the most widely-usefulcontent on this domain. To see some of the suggestions I’ve received so far and/or to add your own, see[this mildly-successful thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/ios/comments/l5p7ly/underdocumented_ios_functions_stuff_you_wish) I postedin r/iOS. 
https://youtube.com/watch?v=uXIXjAWXVfQ 
When I have finally tired of talking about handsets once more, I hope to return my attention toward someother overwhelmingly-ambitious monstrosities like my [academic paper](https://github.com/extratone/bigblue) proposing federated, open-source social networks in favor of the BigBoys, my [report](https://github.com/extratone/bilge/issues/44) on the experience of returning to academiafor a semester in 2020, and my [evaluation of Notion](https://github.com/extratone/bilge/issues/12) asperhaps the next Big Step in the evolution of notetaking software. Perhaps before tackling projects the sizeof these, I intend to compile another [listicle of handy tips](https://github.com/extratone/bilge/issues/28) fornewcomers to Writeas. As I linked before, you can now view the entirety of *The Psalms’* status in as muchdetail as you’d like via [its Project Board on GitHub](https://github.com/extratone/bilge/projects/1).

Let’s hope 2021’s equivalent of this review doesn’t take me untilFebruary to publish!

slicing proud, there ­lashed to the stern of the vessel *Hateful*; 
her keel lain by callouses of home ­hands & feet stiff (long ago, they hauled barley, by bushel down a gravel road) 
but an instant of that rarified quiet stays the haze's obfuscation, faltered: our sisters lie lynched on dire alters 
our homesteads, crypts; shrines to delirium the chords of our songs left unresolved in imposters' inrequiem 
plastic for stone; fiberglass for coal stale rot for flesh, cut with nothing to our bones 
mirages in the mirror, darkly: devil's imps roost on red Remingtons, limp 
plugged, our ears in mute 
terror's gluttony, stripped down furrows of falsity's fatherly fugue **truth: our souls seethe in the dark** we are drowning in our own deceptions 
in excess, we are barren we parade nothing but the lies which proceed the whole of Earthly pain 
breathless, we are foolish monstrosities ­the incongruent Lords of amplified insanity 
resolute, we are the hearthen hole into which all eventually fall, famished for youth 
manic, we are the monopolized manufacturers of mantra; an ambient, discordant dirge 
patriotic, we produce only pervading paternal plague

abrasive, we are needlessly suffering ­the listless harlequin of a nation

# Huh. 
## *Bilge* is the monobyline World Wide Web blog which I’ve been trying *not* to create for nearly 10 years. 
I began to notice myself tiring out variations of that specific phrase — *nearly ten years*, *for the past 10years*, *10 years ago* — in both recent casual conversation and formal written arguments, which havesince coincided with another observation: the contemporary stigma surrounding the term **blog** intowhich I’d often tossed my hat had blinded me to some very valuable just-discovered creations in themedium. This blog is unlikely to replicate the sort of value found in academic and industry voices, but it’soperated with a guarantee the reader will discover *something* unlike anything they’ve seen anywhere else,backed by a 100% time refund, no questions asked.

# Who. 
![David Blue Diner](https://i.snap.as/gZajpYw.jpeg) 
I’m David Blue, and my two most consistent associations are 1) identity defined by ‘*my work*,’ which hasmeant many things over time, and 2) infinitely curious attraction to people who make things. I have aspiredto be a heavy machinery engineer, watchmaker, commercial pilot, automotive journalist, and editorialplatform for the young voices who matter. The latter two are the adult labels that stuck, though — and thefirst of those is the only one I’ve yet to be much good at. 
**I’ve already born witness to innovation bridging divisions between people throughout the greatestinformational renaissance my species has ever seen.** 
Originally, I wrote about our relationship with **cars** ([2019 Volkswagen Atlas Review](https://dieselgoth.com/2019-volkswagen-atlas-sel-vr6-review)) and now **technology** ([Bandcamp:Streaming's Secret Savior](https://bilge.world/bandcamp-streaming-music)) from a perspective that feelstedious or abstract to some, but is generally entertaining, through-and-through. I’m proud of the work I’vedone so far, which has been wild, absurd, reflective, and hilarious — occasionally all in the same work as Idevelop my voice. 
After publishing a [**collection of poetry**](http://bit.ly/Feebles) from my adolescence and early adulthoodin the Spring of 2016, I launched an online magazine called [**Extratone**](http://extratone.com) in theinterest of pursuing and defining new culture and ideas. The project and I have been indistinguishable in thefour years since, and I’m extremely proud of what I’ve done with it, but I’ve recently refocused my effortback onto my own voice so that we may both benefit in the future. 
Currently, I'm working on a nonfiction project entitled ***[For God's Sake, Just Sit Down to Piss](https://davidblue.wtf/piss)*** - a self-help/advice-ish book for young American men which I’ve tinkeredwith since 2015 commenting on behavior I have personally witnessed from white, straight, CIS Americanmales ages 15-35. Given the sensitivity of its topic along with my own curiosity regarding the idea, I amwriting the book in public [via Git](https://github.com/extratone/piss).

# Automatics Suck 
## America's favorite drivetrain is not ideal. 
Us drivers of cars with manual transmissions tend to look down on those who drive automatics. It’s like an exclusive club. Only the extremely talented, gorgeous-looking, and legendary athletes of yore are allowed in. 
Well, that’s bullshit. So those of you that know the “standard” can keep your mouths shut and bask in thequiet satisfaction that you’re saving the planet. 
The truth is, for those of you that don’t know, driving “stick” is totally simple. Once you understand the basicconcepts of how the transmission and clutch work together, you can figure it out with no real instruction atall. So with that in mind, I’d like to tell you that automatic transmissions just….suck. Really.
 Mind you, I’m not talking about Dual-Clutch Transmissions, SMGs (Sequential Manual Gearboxes,) or any ofthat fancy stuff that has only recently become somewhat popular in the mainstream (affordable) automarket. I’m talking about automatics with a torque converter, that magically inefficient device that hascarried America’s laziness in driving for the last 50 years. 
Now before I go on, I suppose I owe you a technical explanation. Let’s start with the basics. First off, atransmission is the device that separates the engine from the wheels. With both automatic and manualtransmissions, “gears” are used to vary the ratio between the engine’s crankshaft and the drive shaft goingto the wheels. It’s essentially a buffer between the engine’s relative consistency and the inconsistent worldthat you drive in. 
![Automatic Gearbox Abstract](https://i.snap.as/U2c418j.png) 
But that’s not quite all there is. 
Traditional transmissions require an interruption in power from the engine to shift these “gears,” and tocome to a stop at a traffic light, in your driveway, or on the side of the highway to pick up a hooker. Inmanuals, this is typically accomplished with a clutch, a device that could most simply be explained as twoplates that are pressed together to couple, and brought apart to become independent. A clutch is normallycoupled, it’s when the clutch petal is pushed in that the plates separate, and the transmission is isolated fromthe engine. Automatic transmissions use a type of fluid coupling to accomplish the same task, called a torqueconverter. 
The advantage of the latter is that, when paired with an automatic transmission, the driver only requires oneinput to get the car moving and vary its velocity, and that is the accelerator pedal. A manual transmissionrequires three inputs, on the other hand. (Accelerator pedal, clutch, and gearshift.) In my mind, the torqueconverter has some huge disadvantages in a world where millions are spent to save 20 lbs. on one cardesign. 
Have you ever noticed that cars equipped with manuals are usually noticeably more fuel efficient than theirautomatic counterparts? Some of that could be attributed to the greater control that comes with manuals,but most of it is from the torque converter’s main design flaw. A clutch can be completely disengaged andcompletely engaged. So, with a healthy vehicle, there is 0% of the engine’s power moving to thetransmission when the clutch pedal is depressed fully. Likewise when the clutch pedal is allowed completelyout, the clutch essentially becomes a shaft, and 100% of the engine’s power is being fed to the transmission. 
A torque converter couples via fluid, however, meaning **there is never a solid mechanical connectionbetween the engine and the transmission**. (Unless the transmission is equipped with a lock-up clutch,which is essentially a clutch that locks the torque converter mechanically when it is no longer required todump the engine’s energy into friction. These are becoming more and more common, but the majority ofvehicles on the road are missing them.) This means that a traditional torque converter is **never 100%efficient**. 
Also, a torque converter is never completely disengaged. When sitting at a traffic light, the driver typicallylightly applies the brakes to hold the car from moving forward. Have you ever considered what you’re doing?The engine is basically dumping energy into the torque converter in the form of friction. It is literally nodifferent from holding the gas and the brakes at the same time. 
What the hell? How is that accepted in a world where Al Gore and Prius’s exist? 
Oh wait! As United States citizens, we’re lazy as shit! 
**84% of cars sold in North America are equipped with an automatic transmission, as opposed to 20% inEurope**. 
You could make the excuse that we love automatics because of all our stop-and-go traffic, and yet, as acitizen of the Midwestern U.S, I see automatics MUCH more often than I see traffic congestion. 
The real answer is that we just don’t want to bother with a clutch pedal and a gearshift when we could betexting or doing makeup. 
Luckily, the great minds of our time have come up with solutions that adapt to us so that we don’t have toadapt to them. (As always.) Probably the simplest is the aforementioned “lock-up clutch,” which eliminatesthe inefficiency of the torque converter by mechanically coupling at high speed. But that doesn’t exactly solvethe problem of sitting over a nice gas to friction converter at traffic lights.Well here’s a tip. When you stop at a traffic light, bump your shift lever one up into neutral. It shouldn’trequire that you hold a safety button to go back and forth between Drive and Neutral. This prevents thatunnecessary friction. Combine that with a lockup clutch, and you’re basically driving a manual!……Exceptwithout the enjoyment. 
You could call this a rant on one of the most successful inventions the modern automobile has ever seen….because it is. And I doubt you’ll hear anyone else complain about it. But there really are flaws in thedesign that I wish consumers would figure out. Before all this hybridism, eco-mindedness, and hippie-crazedgreen malarkey, maybe we should eliminate the evil energy-wasting beast that is the torque converter.

# Revelations in Web Starvation 
![Opera No Connection](https://i.snap.as/9wsQDXz.png) 
*Opera's no-connection mascot is the cutest branding on any current web browser. Fight me.* 
Yesterday, I finished moving out of the situation I’d been living in for ~6 weeks in the basement of asoutheast Portland home near the western base of Mt. Tabor. You'd see it just across from the flatWashington Mall-ish grass rectangle that provides daring suburban explorers their most worthwhile rewardfor reaching the top. It resembles one of many local residential templates which I was completelyunequipped to understand when I arrived in the area last year. You'll never observe any of its inhabitantsoutside doing any of the things people do when they are unaware of - or unconcerned with being observed.Walking by an afternoon front yard “family gathering” (young white parents and their one or two children) isa prospect of haste. Introducing new movement to the vicinity after the sun has gone down stirs a disruptionfrom deep within its energy. Everyone in this town is afraid. I say it’s an unnatural way to live, but I’m just afucking bumpkin. 
As you may or may not have observed, the vast majority of my working being lives on the World Wide Web,which requires, fundamentally…. An internet connection. In most any other present-day first worldcircumstance, these are infinitely available, but I discovered – after the moving process was entirelycompleted, of course – that my tenants did **not** actually have an in-house connection of their own. Theyexplained to me that their neighbor – an “IT professional” for IBM – had offered to let them use *his* WiFinetwork, and they’d found the arrangement sufficient. However, because IBM is *The* archaic marque ofdigital fascism (disclosure: they are also my [sworn blood enemy](http://bilge.world/compaq),) it wasn’taltogether a surprise when they told me that his offer did not extend to “guests.” 
I considered that a defined period of WiFi fasting at home could make for an interesting experiment ­perhaps even a needed mental reset - and I couldn't reasonably afford to acquire my own dedicated 4Ghotspot, anyway. The reality became a relentless paranoid battle for any trickle of access - sometimes for *adozen bytes per second*; for just the most basic digital communications like SMS and email - which led tomore superstitious hypotheses about precarious antenna orientation, progress bar hallucinations, out-of­control frustration, and hopeless fixation with refresh commands than I remember from 2nd generation cellnetworks in the Midwest, 10 years ago, or even domestic dial-up, and truly revealed the extent to which I'dtaken connectivity for granted.

My observations of my own behavior throughout this drought are worth more than their mild amusement:even this petty disparity (I was never more than two or three yards from nearly-whole signal at the top ofthe outside stairs) re-sensitized my perspective to the abstract concept of network unreliability which I'dbeen entirely spared since prepubescence. Though 4 billion human beings now regularly interact with theWorld Wide Web, their connections span a mathematically gargantuan spectrum of speed and reliability. Inurbanizing myself as an adult, I have unconsciously latched on to the entitled ideal that internet access is apublic service and accepted dramatically-increasing dependence on services that engorge greater andgreater volumes of bandwidth without any explanation but their lack of incentives for efficiency. I reflect onmy relationship with technology every day, yet I still became an oblivious data glutton in mind-bogglinglylittle time. 
The current state of connectivity in the United States, alone is quite alarming under 5-year-absentexamination. Mobile carriers are [*still* merging](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-sprint-corp-m-a-t­mobile-us/t-mobile-runs-behind-the-scenes-pr-push-to-support-sprint-deal-idUSKCN1L512A) and thecompartmentalization of *all* ISP customers between prioritization tiers continues to be tested, [lessencumbered by regulatory safeguards](https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/24/17882842/us-internet­broadband-map-isp-fcc-wireless-competition) than ever. I don't know my politics on this issue, nor do I have any specific solutions, but I'd point to the work of the [National Digital Inclusion Alliance](http://digitalinclusion.org/), and express only that I hope the pace of the technology's progress is greaterthan the growth of its merchants' imaginations and the scope of their greed so that the sheer volume ofplenty overcomes even the shortest-sighted, and humanity as a whole continues toward a more justdistribution of connectivity. What I *am* in a position to share are the revelations about our currentinfrastructure, software services, and hardware devices I could only have discovered from such anexperience. 
## Variables 
I remember standing on top of a John Deere combine's 15ft-high roof in order to successfully make atelephone call 10 years ago - one of thousands of behaviors which were more abruptly and universallyrequired for a few years and subsequently more abruptly forgotten than any other such united tick inAmerican history. This blip of shared technological adversity also led to an unfathomably vast collectivemythology surrounding incredibly tedious manipulation of our archaic handsets in varying degrees ofdesperation for *just one bar*. 
My Sprint plan includes unlimited 4G LTE data for my iPhone 8 Plus with a 10GB tethering limit - whichperformed so admirably in the lonely role of my thin tether to the rest of the world that I am obligated toactually use the phrase ***like a champ\***. but the quality of its connection is dramatically impacted bythe studio apartment's depth. From the space's geometric center at stomach-level, the handset indicates"1x," meaning CDMA 1x, which *is* technically a data connection, but certainly not in any usable sense forthe network applications of 2018\. The native Twitter app, Apple Mail, Snapchat, Instagram & Facebook,Safari, Opera Mini, Firefox, Chrome, and all others I tested in this condition would simply timeout – giving upafter a minute or two of repeated attempts before declining to continue, each in their own minor variations.An interesting anecdote: in a pertinent reflection our human ballooning expectations for connectivity at alltimes, the language of our creations across both iOS and desktop applications has recently becomenoticeably less accountable and more accusatory. Instead of saying “____ can’t connect to the internet,”many of the browsers will declare an absolute: *three is no internet connection*, or just straight up**blame** the user: “*you* are not connected to the internet." (Emphasis mine.) No apologies... Noregrets. 
> Dude, no wifi? Where the fuck are U? 
Directly above my head’s place on the bed, the phone could be propped on the sill of the East-facing windowon a clear-skied day, enabling it to scrounge up and loosely establish enough contact to receive calls andtext messages, claiming 1-4 3G “bars,” and a single in 4G at night, though one overcast Northwestern weekbasically did it in completely. If we were actually doing something to noticeably increase our old Nokia boxes’bandwidth bids on those early networks by turning them every which way to find “better reception,” it’scompletely futile on current devices. (I’m fairly sure I remember a network professional explaining this to mewhen LTE was first gaining traction.) It was immediately apparent that orientation had no effect, but thehandset’s bearing certainly did… Most sensitively so. I realized quite early on that I should endeavor not tospend too much time standing in different positions throughout the space attempting to will on a browserloader bar above a story I’ve probably read already. Intstead, I committed to the very first position thatindicated any correlation whatsoever with a better connection: atop the biscuit tin on the metal rack nearestthe outside door. 
It’s been three months, but I’m still using my tired old Hewlett-Packard 6930p [backup machine](http://bilge.world/linux-bitch/), so I was very skeptical about the odds we’d be successfully reliably pairingits ancient network adapter – [now worth just $9.99](http://a.co/d/ij9mfeD) – with that of A Cellular Phone10 years its junior without struggling significantly with range or reliability, especially considering that itcannot run a single one of its [vast library of proprietary drivers](https://support.hp.com/us­en/document/c01538039) on Linux. You’d at least assume they’d need to be practically touching each otherto maintain a smooth marriage, yet the only compromise I had to make on the local end was to bring themnear to each other as they paired. Afterwards, I could return the phone to its tin and work on the laptopfrom the kitchen table, 12-15 feet away. (Curiously enough, the 6930p itself shipped with hotspot capabilityby way of the SIM card slot behind the unit’s main battery.) 
Quantifying the speed of a mobile data connection as you would a dedicated WiFi network is incongruentbecause the former trades in a much less consistent packet stream. That’s the extent of my knowledge, butit’s easy to visualize: a signal that can travel a mile or two in big globules bound to be intercepted insplashes upon the device’s little antennae, versus your home network’s local, evenly distributed sauna ofirradiated mist. It’s much less definite, to say the least, and I can’t actually comprehend the sort of voodoothat’s required in order to expand and maintain the networks as they are, nor would I ever wish to burdenmyself with such knowledge.

# Bandcamp: Streaming's Secret Savior 
![Bandcamp Logo Banner](https://i.snap.as/toF3UAy.jpg) 
## As the industry endeavors once again to reconcile the cultural and financial incentives of streamingdigital music, one independent platform has wavered little from its 10-year-long mission to bring thebusiness to the unsigned artist with elegance and integrity. 
If you’ve ever thought to yourself *wow, Bandcamp has looked basically the same forever*, you wereentirely correct – now for a tenth of the century, at least – and you’ll be hard-pressed to find another SiliconValley technology company toting a venture-funded origin story with such casual, yet robust long-standinguser relationships underneath an unwavering, bullshit-free commitment to their product. Even under themost ludicrous scrutiny, the company’s rudder is flawless and its course true. What at first glance you’dswear to be an unsolicited conclusion to an obscure examination could very reasonably be described as*cheesy*, *stubborn*, *dweebish*, *pious*, or just generally *boring*, indeed, yet the respective accuracyof each of these adjectives are no more than the byproducts of the very same operational ethics which we’vesuggested, requested, demanded, and begged the rest of the world’s computing capitol to re-adopt, enforce,or at least *ponder* for a beat. The volume of the masses’ exponentially-increasing attendance of late isonly overcome by its hysterical shouting match, so let us pipe down for a while, now so that we may beprecise as we dig deeper into the methodology which has finally led to a profitable, drama-free outlyingtechnology organization without the need for a single drop of analogous sweat over its brand upkeep. Byarranging the company in its infancy to so precisely and elementally align with the needs of its customers,the original troupe of Bandcamp Bums ensured profound and lasting simplicity in the single overarchingpriority for those in every single role behind the quiet perpetuation of Bandcamp dot com: **selling good****music**. 
<iframe width="auto" height="auto" src="https://www.mixcloud.com/widget/iframe/?hide_cover=1&light=1&feed=%2Fdavod%2F%D1%82%D0%BD%CE%B1%D0%B8kf%CF%85l­f%CF%83%D1%8F-b%CE%B1%D0%B8dc%CE%B1%D0%BC%CF%81-2018-%D0%BCix%2F" frameborder="0" ></iframe> 
The platform indiscriminately provides both individual artists and labels with a clean, cozy, charming,smartly-designed and technically competent storefront with a wide-open storage allocation, optimal searchengine optimization and a widely-trusted point of sale experience in exchange for 15% of any sales thatshould come in – [significantly less](https://medium.com/@gloom303/a-year-ago-i-released-an-ep-on­spotify-itunes-and-bandcamp-this-is-what-i-l-earned-872925797930) than other channels; *half* what AppleMusic will take. In examining Bandcamp’s history, its impact on independent music, and its viability as analternative streaming service, we shall excavate the truth behind the derisive cynicism directed its way bythe titans of the tech and music press. Over the course of this super link-laden journey, we’d consider thealarmingly hypocritical possibility that it’s been overlooked by mainstream conversations only because it hasso long operated in the precise manner we claim is so hopelessly absent from its neighbors in its deliberate,principled, and innovative journey towards a transparent, progressive vision.

To catch our starting gun, we must first travel to *Face The Music 2016* in Melbourne – as far as one canpossibly get from The Valley – alongside Bandcamp’s super-worldly Chief Curator, [Andrew Jervis](https://bandcamp.com/andrewjervis) to observe his interview for a live audience. 
> Bandcamp has always grown extremely organically. There’s never actually been any advertising that we’vedone; there’s never any advertising on the site, and there never will be. We haven’t really tooted our hornvery hard. 
In fact, just about everything from the shrewd idealism of those who beget its conception to the on-the-nose care in their person-to-person customer service is so adamantly inverse of the tech industry archetype whichthe global End User community at large are presently discovering at twice the speed of sound there should*at least* be some conspiratorializing going around. Where I come from, launching a desolate business tolittle mainstream success with persistence and dignified determination is (or should be) regarded as a telltalesign that one is running a front (according to the television, anyway,) but exploration of this plausibilityyielded nothing in Bandcamp’s case, even after I took the risk of incrimination and begged a certain Boston-based future funk producer to accept my ginormous bribe and include *any* sort of pharmacologicalsubstance with his summer beat tape.

As uncomfortably as it lands on the soul, no moniker describes Bandcamp more comprehensively than “anonline record store.” As far as [Ethans](https://youtu.be/inzhStQJFQw) go, Bandcamp’s CEO and founders’public attaché Ethan Diamond is as good as they come: it’s quite telling that he is the only Silicon Valley CEOwho’s remained intellectually grounded enough with the rest of us in order to retain any skills in nuancedforms of verbal communication like… humor. The closest the company has ever come to promotion? Hisawkward, sub-20-minute [presentation](https://youtu.be/MaUkS-lr-ZM) at the XOXO Festival 2014 offeredan impressively succinct introduction to their greater mission considering the unmistakable agony in his bodylanguage. 
“We worked out of the public library for the first four years of the company's existence,” he admits.Impressively, Bandcamp was operated entirely as a “virtual company” until 2015. 
Either Bandcamp just happens to be the single Silicon Valley company where the executives are unanimouslyso fucking fulfilled by their work without exception that they aren’t compelled to leave it long enough tostumble upon the inevitable coastal colleague with a connection to something like The Internet HistoryPodcast, or technology journalism has definitively lost all reverence for actual innovation in favor of the[emotionally-charged](https://www.bcg.com/en-us/publications/2018/ideas-emotions-innovation-riding­amazement-cycle.aspx) Innovation Myth, now [relinquished almost entirely](https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/24/17610348/twitter-elon-musk-display-name-change-lock-account­crypto-scams) to the narrative control of its own protagonists. Perhaps it was inevitable that Elon Musk,Sundar Pichai, Mark Zuckerberg, and Jeff Bezos would become immortalized as “those who make thingshappen,” but our ability to quantify value as consumers tends to scurry rapidly away behind our backs whenthey’re turned by the constant distraction of these mostly inert figureheads. As their personalities have stolenthe story, the people in industry with their hands on real product have all but completely disappeared fromthe frame, and all of the work remaining at the End User’s eye level was abandoned by aspiration long agoand replaced with the unfulfilling mechanism of A Quick Buck. Though now we are proceeding into a similarframe – only because our subject cares more about their mission than claiming recognition for it and mightjust be the first such company run by a cast who become sincerely defensive at the suggestion of a cash-out. 
“Bandcamp’s philosophy has always been very different [from] a lot of the companies we’re surrounded by,”reflects Jervis. “We are not a ‘let’s-raise-money-and-burn-through-it’ type of company.” 
I know that your mind has been trained by years of engagement with the digital media of a rapidly-globalizing, venture capital-obsessed society to block the passage of this sort of language across yourconscious threshold at risk of life-threatening overexposure to the Medium Dialect and its churnalisingneoliberal cyberchode scholars of the Personal Brand; I know you’ve read the exact same quote from howmany entrepreneurs in how many worthless, masturbatory business magazine profiles, but I swear on myone-of-a-kind Estonian Hilary Duff pullout that Jervis speaks without irony or deception. how many fuckingchurnicles have abandoned you, but this time, it’s actually sincere.

# On The Web 
Though Bandcamp was technically the first comprehensive library-modeled music streaming service inexistence, the topical conversations between both technology and music journalists and industry executivesflooding both podcast and news feeds at the moment orbiting the “Cord-Cutting” phenomena as it’s washedover television, cinema, and music are rooted in the same building blocks as the core technology behind thedelivery of all of these conversations as well as their subjects, funny enough. As long as my subgenerationhas known it, The Web has been a source of sound in some manifestation, but the example with the mostperplexing history was also the first. Today, one of five tabs in the main menu of my iPhone’s native musicapp contains the text “Radio” beneath an “antenna with waves” graphic which opens a service once called[iTunes Radio](https://web.archive.org/web/20150608143103/https:/www.apple.com/itunes/itunes-radio/)that was absorbed into – and [restricted to subscribers of](https://www.theverge.com/2016/1/15/10777790/itunes-radio-apple-music-january-28) – Apple Music as of2016, confusingly. However, both “iTunes Radio” and “Apple Music Radio(?)” – along with any and all audiostreaming services (mentioned and not) – are fundamentally nothing more than different UX designinterpretations of the “simple” practice of streaming an audio file, which made its debut at the turn of thecentury in the form of “Internet Radio.” Astonishingly, the protocol – still referred to by at least one personon Earth as “Webcasting,” no doubt – has survived nearly 20 years, and even the youngest of us have likelyencountered it in unusual situations. 
Ironically, the [majority](http://radio.garden/) of Internet Radio broadcasts remaining on the air are nothingmore than live duplicates of the traditional radio wave-bound products from the physical stations your car’shead unit receives. Even the current desktop version of iTunes maintains support for streaming “audio filesover the internet,” though a glance at [Apple’s dated support page](https://support.apple.com/kb/PH19478?locale=en_US) for the process suggests it hasn’t crossed anybody’s mind for at least half of that history. In1994, the publicly-funded radio network Voice of America became the “[First [radio] on the Internet](http://www.chriskern.net/history/voaFirstOnTheInternet.html)” when it [began](https://groups.google.com/forum/?hl=en#!original/rec.radio.shortwave/2pQ9KUYmLqo/wqhhXS2k-lAJ) –after an introduction by Al Gore, no less – “offering digitized audio versions of selected newscasts and otherprogram segments in 15 languages on its public internet server on Monday, Aug. 15,” according to formerengineer Chris Kern. However – since we’re already this deep into internet history – a distinction must beestablished between streaming static files and streaming live audio. The first relies on pre-recorded audiofiles uploaded to a publicly-accessible server – in Kern’s original case, “via anonymous FTP and the InternetGopher protocol,” which continues to be the elemental process behind every audio file streamed across theWeb (including those on Bandcamp, Apple Music, Spotify, etc.) more or less because it ain’t broke. 
Semantically, “live” digital audio streaming in its aforementioned “purest” form is more or less exclusive toInternet Radio. Obscured aside from the traditional station simulcast, Web-only Internet Radio stations havetheir own of “[the Internet’s quiet success stories](https://www.thestar.com/business/2007/04/09/web_radio_may_stream_north_to_canada.html),” filled withquaint experiences and an endless cycle of death proclamations which continue to be disproven, anywise. 
On June 27th, 1999, *The Seattle Times* ran [an especially worthwhile introduction to the concept](http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19990627&slug=2968794) that likelyrepresents the only major newspaper’s mention of SHOUTcast (the first and likely last name in DIY WebDJing) in the history of the printed word within a work of truly phenomenal tech reporting on MarkMataassa’s part. From the past, one will find his chillingly spot-on foresight and well-considered observationsare bestrewed with mind-boggling hilarity when they look.

I only have a few experiences with Internet Radio of my own, but they’re all rampantly more memorablethan one would expect. The now in-stasis [NWIRE](https://twitter.com/nwireradio) project was by the mostrelevantly intriguing and [savvily-curated](https://soundcloud.com/themartmusic/nwire-radio-guest-mix-11­feb-2017) home for a diverse host of electronic musicians I’ve ever come across – it was my second defaultbrowser tab for most of 2017, when I’d even listen to the odd-hour broadcasts overseen by just theautomated library-perusing bot for hours. On [episode 16 of *Drycast*](https://anchor.fm/extratone/episodes/Juke-Master-Samantha-Carter-and-the-Producers-Extravaganza­e1neqc/a-a4674c), I recounted [the absurd tale](https://clyp.it/mps4yfyv) of my surprise morning encounterwith a Norwegian station’s live broadcast from some European breakcore club, which was likely responsiblefor the most fun I’ve ever had working in retail.

*Extratone*’s former Tech Editor is partial to a station called [Radio Swiss Jazz](http://www.radioswissjazz.ch/en), which appears to be thriving in comparison with most visiblebroadcasters, and unapologetically emits a bizarre amalgamation of tunes both chart-topping and SeriouslyObscure across every conceivable genre (including Marching Music,) and continent of origin. Between everyfew charts, the brief commentary and station identification has provided our own private mystery: Was thatone pre-recorded? This guy was on yesterday, but has since shed his accent? However, these tiny temporarymysteries are Internet Radio’s only remaining value for us, and I suspect the same is true for all but themost laggard laggards. For as long as I’ve been coherent enough to disseminate between much of anything,very few of its visible offerings have offered anything groundbreaking or fresh, perhaps out of negligence(one can very easily arrange leave a machine running SHOUTcast to shuffle through a given library of musicand/or podcasts indefinitely,) frustration, or economic necessity. 
Crucially, the truly *most* critical consequences and contributions provided by the pioneers of Internet Radioto our current digital streaming experience were centered within intellectual property legislation andadvertising-supported business. Unfortunately, this juncture marks our complete departure from mywheelhouse, but thankfully, a few sacred accounts of one of technology’s foremost confusing clashes withthe ill-equipped, technoilliterate monoliths of the American justice system do indeed remain. As early as2002, the ineffable Doc Searls reported on a document authored by the Library of Congress’ CopyrightRoyalty Board called “[Determination of Royalty Rates and Terms for Ephemeral Recording and WebcastingDigital Performance of Sound Recordings](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2016/05/02/2016­09707/determination-of-royalty-rates-and-terms-for-ephemeral-recording-and-webcasting-digital­performance)” for *Linux Journal* in an encyclopedic breakdown of its implications ironically entitled “[WhyAre So Many Internet Radio Stations Still on the Air](https://www.linuxjournal.com/article/6218)?” I wouldhope my comprehension is sufficient to declare that *this was no Cambridge Analytica*: only a few yearssubsequent the technology’s inception, operators within the Internet Radio business faced serious andimmediate fines for their pre-enforcement distribution of copyrighted material stretching *four years* back –the severity of which the Doc suggested would “surely bankrupt many of the individual broadcasters thathave been pioneering this marketplace for the longest time.” 
> Unlike the commercial radio stations we hear on the old-fashioned airwaves, Internet radio stations' primary market relationship isn't with advertisers; it's with listeners. In many cases, the listeners are theprimary source of revenue. This business model is similar to that of noncommercial (public) radio, only themarket relationship is much more direct and efficient. Internet radio stations don't need to stopprogramming to hold marathon whine-fests begging listeners to call phone volunteers and pledge money toqualify for a mug or a t-shirt. Listeners simply click on a PayPal or an Amazon link, and after a few moreclicks they've made a payment. 
By [March, 2010](https://web.archive.org/web/20100330102643/http:/directory.google.com/Top/Arts/Music/Sound_Files/MP3/Streaming/Stations), just 374 stations were aggregated in Google’s Internet Radio Directory, and my ownquick sample from its list unfortunately indicated that most are now silent, but SHOUTcast has yet to beabandoned after all this time and we can safely suppose the core architecture of the internet will remainrecognizable enough to support it until after we’re all dead, rendering the necessary tools indefinitely readyand accessible should new projects in NWIRE’s vein come along (I know of no better fate I could wish uponthe protocol.) From Internet Radio’s pioneer days, we must skip over a whole era to close in on Bandcamp’sorigin in the very brightest peak of Web 2.0. 
Again, we find ourselves in 2008 and nobody knows what an iPhone is, but the same classic rock-worshiping,upper-middle class, white collar Early Majority who first loved Internet Radio are now rapidly and delightedlydistributing links to something called “Pandora dot com” between AOL and Hotmail inboxes. True luxurymusic reproduction comes in the form of Beats headphones motivated by a 320GB iPod Classic. Buddingaudiophiles and backpacker dweebs illegally torrent lossless .FLACs to play over their Christmas-gifted studiomonitors with WinAmp, which they’ve set up to impeccably “scrobble” their history with every played track totheir Last.fm profiles. Everybody else is still buying music from iTunes. (Those who cannot afford to buy themusic they intend to add to their libraries transition to the music nerd classification as soon as they’vesought out a way to obtain it free.) “Streaming” comes from subscription services like Rhapsody (nowNapster,) which are [too buried in Digital Rights Management controversy](http://www.alphr.com/features/218559/the-online-music-rip-off) to feel sustainable. MySpace Music hasjust begun to fade away – next year, in “the Twitter era,” [SoundCloud will definitively replace it](https://www.wired.com/2009/07/soundcloud-threatens-myspace-as-music-destination-for-twitter-era/) asthe go-to creator network – and Pandora’s immediate future is bright – they’ll make a big move on brand-new mobile streaming experience when they [launch their iPhone OS app](https://www.cnet.com/news/photos-hands-on-with-pandoras-internet-radio-iphone-app/) in July, but thelimited performance of the handset’s EDGE network will render it a poor alternative to onsite .mp3s for yearsto come. 
In January, to minimal acclaim, Oddpost’s Ethan Diamond launched Bandcamp, the startup with programmerfriends Joe Holt, Shawn Grunberger, and Neal Tucker to be “a sortof WordPress for musicians” – an easily-created, well-designed landing page to showcase one’s digital music files. As Holt laments in [an interviewwith ](http://htmltimes.com/band-camp.php)*The HTML Times*, creating an online presence for your musichad long been “a pain in the ass.” 
“You need to find a place to host it, you’ve gotta get the metadata right, it’s just hard. So we just decidedwe would do that hard part for musicians so that they didn’t have to be so nerdy.” 
As an address to all of their shared complaints about the experience of online music distribution up to thatpoint, [early Bandcamp](https://web.archive.org/web/20090716104620/http:/bandcamp.com) was anastounding piece of engineering. The quaint, unsurprisingly crate-digger-looking Ethan Diamond – who’smore or less remained the singular public face of the company since the very beginning – began a brandtradition of transparently music-nerdy correspondence with his [first post on the Bandcamp blog](https://daily.bandcamp.com/2008/09/16/hello-cleveland/), explaining the solutions the team had come upwith in greater detail. 
> We keep your music streaming and downloading quickly and reliably, whether it’s 3am on a Sunday, or thehour your new record drops and Pitchfork gives it a scathingly positive review. We make your tracksavailable in every format under the sun, so the audiophilic nerderati can have their FLAC and eat mp3 v2. 
We adorn your songs with all the right metadata, so they sail into iTunes with artwork, album, band andtrack names intact. We mutter the various incantations necessary to keep your site top-ranked in Google, sowhen your fans search for your hits, they find your music long before they find bonkersforlyrics.com oriMyFace. We give your fans easy ways to share your music with their friends, and we give you gorgeoustools that reveal exactly how your music is spreading, so you can fan the fire. 
The launch garnered very little attention from tech or music publications of the time, but [Andy Baio’sinterview with Diamond](https://waxy.org/2008/09/bandcamp_launch/) provides a substantial, technicallyin-depth picture of just how revolutionary and necessary it was. Most of what has continued to makeBandcamp such an essential tool was present at the very beginning: server-side stats and metadata (aunique architectural undertaking, no doubt,) track and album-oriented pagination, and a robust, easily-embedded Flash player. 
<div style="padding:56.25% 0 0 0;position:relative;"><iframesrc="https://player.vimeo.com/video/1739268?title=0&byline=0&portrait=0"style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:auto;height:auto;" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen"allowfullscreen></iframe></div><script src="https://player.vimeo.com/api/player.js"></script> 
Study [Diamond’s first “screencast”](https://vimeo.com/1739268) alongside a [video tour of SoundCloud](https://vimeo.com/1857085) from the period and you’ll notice just how much more functional, future-proofed and *dignified* Bandcamp appeared in comparison. As apprehensive as I am to be caught arguingfor minimalism over good design, it’s made perfect sense in the use case of *this one platform*, which knew*exactly* what it was from birth, along with what it would *always* be, apparently, which is such a bizarrereversal of the archetypes and the relentless common narrative we know from The Valley’s legends. Ethanfirst shows the consumer’s experience – none of which has changed after a whole decade aside from quality-specific track purchases – before delving into the artist-side UI, beginning with the statistics tool, whichincluded playback and search insights to a depth that was (and still is) unheard of from a free service. Then,he demonstrates the publishing process from upload to playback: adding album art, setting a release date,and pricing its purchase. Aside from their removal of the old waveform visualizer (I couldn’t find any recordof an announcement of this decision, official or otherwise,) Bandcamp has changed absolutely *nothing* ofwhat’s shown in Diamond’s tutorial. In the next few months, they would add [custom page design](https://daily.bandcamp.com/2008/11/26/design-customization/), [email address capture](https://daily.bandcamp.com/2008/12/22/free-download-email-capture-thingy/), and [support for customdomains](https://daily.bandcamp.com/2009/01/23/custom-domains-custom-domains/). By October 2008,they’d made enough waves to be [picked up by ](https://www.cnet.com/news/bandcamp-for-cleaner-music­sites/)*CNET*, for whatever that was worth. Apparently, [Facebook Music](https://venturebeat.com/2008/10/22/facebook-music-is-getting-its-act-together/) was a legitimate propertyas well, but I do not remember anything about it at all—pondering an alternate reality in which *The* SocialNetwork became the dominant online music streaming platform leads to a bizarre comparison of NeilDiamond and Mark Zuckerberg which I can’t imagine being altogether productive. Suffice it to say, the twofounders’ visions differ greatly.

# Musicblogocide 
Contextually, it’s also important that we dwell for a moment on the legal and financial hullabaloo surroundingmusic sales during Bandcamp’s first formative years, and the federal government’s losing battle to interpret,enforce, or replace intellectual property law for the information age. As the Web had grown exponentiallymore capable and accessible as a means of audio file distribution, it had become absolutely saturated withblatantly DRM-circumventing .mp3s and .wavs. For years, the quickest way to follow up on a *check it out*sort of music recommendation was simply to search Google for its track name followed by “.mp3.” If the firstgo didn’t yield success, even the most rudimentary application of cryptography – like substituting some variation of “nsilmtic.rar” to find a download for Nas’ *Illmatic*, for instance – was a sure bet for one’s second try, which would often return several copies just laying around Google-indexed WordPress medialibraries, though results hosted on Mediafire were a preferable alternative. This was the establishment intowhich my first adolescent digital music discoveries were borned, and I’m still convinced that 99% of usparticipants were completely without malice. I’d argue heartily that music’s brief escape from the tireless gripof the record industry as its only medium stumbled into digital form would be clearly shown to have a netgain for the whole of American recording artists if you could measure and plot it, including the past, present,and future use of peer-to-peer sharing. 
2010 would prove to be The Year of Reckoning for the fraction of DRM-violating traffic on the *visible* Web,at least. Though it’d be virtually impossible to quantify, is it only reasonable to assume that many siteownersmade some real money from the ad impressions that directly resulted from their unauthorized hosting andMediafire-embedding, but let’s consider how minuscule even the most outrageously liberal overestimatewould be, side-by-side with the billions in additional revenue YouTube has raked in from the same musicsince assuming their place as the de facto platform for quickly summoning just about any work of audiothat’s ever taken digital form. It was in February of that year that Blogger (another Google property)[deleted six music blogs](https://blogger.googleblog.com/2010/02/quick-note-about-music-blog­removals.html) from its platform in response to complaints about allegedly DMCA-violating .mp3s. *TheRegistry* [insisted](https://www.theregister.co.uk/2010/02/11/google_musicblogocide_2010/) the collectivefinger be pointed at the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, itself. 
“It would seem the music bloggers aren't versed in the ways of DMCA claims and counterclaims. But youcan't blame Google for that,” they concluded, after one of the blog’s founders expressed some of the mostpersonally-dramatic words mine empathy has yet faced as [quoted in The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/music/2010/feb/11/google-deletes-music-blogs). 
“It's just sad because we were documenting young people's music from all around the globe. For a lot ofpeople, it was music they wouldn't have been able to discover elsewhere.” 
In hindsight, “blame” is an even more useless avenue of one’s attention than usual, especially when oneparty (Google) was 100% exempt from any consequences all along. The alarming takeaway is not theDMCA’s deftness, but that **Google had the freedom to wait for a parallel business incentive before decidingthe law applied to them**. 
Frankly, we should all have realized long ago just how fucking futile it is to attempt to control any file traffic.Every desktop-class browser ships with the capability to capture any streamable media on the Web with ahandful of keystrokes – it’d take a maximum of 20 minutes to bestow upon even the most casual user theknowledge they’d need to keep every single track, YouTube video, and Twitch stream they’d ever watch,100% legally without a single third-party service/extension interaction, but the crucial question remains towhat end, exactly? It’s easy, but it’s not exactly a fun way to spend an afternoon. The only two rationalesthat’d justify capturing streamed Web files at scale are 1) the totally bonkers inclination that any givenproperty/ies is likely to disappear from the entire World Wide Web, ever or 2) the increasingly rarefyingexpectation of prolonged time away from internet access. 
As Bandcamp has stood so obdurately still, the mainstream music streaming sphere has expanded titanicallyaround it as if enveloping the Indie platform in a surrealist timelapse within the eye of a ruinous techindustry cyclone, which would explosively expand the market into a ghoulish, filthy monstrosity beyondanything we’d recognize from the rule of the WinAmp Hipster, long ago. **Today, the coolest and mostrabid daily music listeners I know all have Spotify memberships**, joining [70 million others](https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/4/16850742/spotify-subscriber-count-70-million-users) globally as ofJanuary. For most, it’s how they prefer to swaddle their lives in a constant soundtrack – at work, in the car,at school, then at home on the television. For many, it’s how they “explore” new music outside of peer andsocial recommendations... or, that’s how the narrative was supposed to go, anyway. Those folks I know whoactually create music, however, are rarely seen using Spotify—even after they’ve endured untold horrors inorder to publish their own music there—because the real story of its track record as a place to “Discover”new artists, genres, or sounds is completely abysmal. When 2017’s streaming data began coming in this pastJanuary, a popular feature by [Galaxie 500](http://galaxie500.bandcamp.com/)’s Damon Krukowski was run by the definitively terminal music magazine of broad notoriety—*Pitchfork*—entitled “[How to Be aResponsible Music Fan in the Age of Streaming](https://pitchfork.com/features/oped/how-to-be-a­responsible-music-fan-in-the-age-of-streaming/),” which he began by citing some very alarming statistics. 
“**More than 99 percent of audio streaming is of the top 10 percent most-streamed tracks** [on Spotify.]Which means less than 1 percent of streams account for all other music.” 
Why? A brazen disregard for necessary meta information, for one. 
“Look now at how badly their applications already serve entire genres of less popular music. Spotify listsrecordings by song title, album title, or featured artist name. But that information is so limited it leaves outeven the other performers on a recording, a crucial aspect to classical and jazz.” 
![Spotify-Pitfork](https://i.snap.as/96z3H8C.png) 
Alarming for those of us who intend to create or consume any music separate the Top 40, anyway, whichone should feel justified expecting from most people, most of the time. Last month, The Carters released analbum on which [even Beyoncé](https://www.bustle.com/p/when-will-everything-is-love-be-on-spotify­beyonce-jay-z-fans-may-have-to-wait-to-stream-the-surprise-album-update-9426616) identified theproblematic service by name. “Patiently waiting for my demise ‘cause my success can’t be quantified,” sherapped, “if I gave two fucks about streaming numbers woulda put Lemonade up on Spotify." Theunfortunate issue with this single denouncement of the industry’s current direction is that its source isadamantly guaranteed a place for her work within Spotify’s top 10 percent for the rest of her career’s lifetime(and probably far beyond.) 
[I could now take the time to complain that she’s also entirely abandoned the city [she owes for her career’screation](https://youtu.be/iiMlq8frlqw) in its darkest hour, but let’s just plan on coming back to the subjectat a later date, when we’ll be sure to touch on how terribly Drake also treats Houston (and women.)] 
Unsurprisingly, the apathy is far from mutual. From the Swedish company’s perspective, the digitsthemselves should’ve been dearly and universally beloved from the beginning, and their exponentiallyballooning hubris became so inflated by 2014 that they [launched a WordPress blog](https://insights.spotify.com/us/about-spotify-insights/) dedicated entirely to promoting and discussing theirdata called [*Spotify Insights*](https://insights.spotify.com/), proclaiming themselves—naturally—to be “theworld’s favorite streaming service,” [championing](https://insights.spotify.com/us/2017/11/02/listening­diversity-spotify/) the growing diversity in their demographics. Though Beyoncé is mentioned only twiceupon a [search of its archive](https://insights.spotify.com/us/?s=beyonce) as it stands today, it’s withfanfare: “[10 Female Artists Women Listen To The Most on Spotify](https://insights.spotify.com/us/2015/03/06/10-female-artists-women-listen-to-the-most/)” declared her thethird most popular female artist among women, globally, and “Single Ladies” the number one female-streamed track in the world (assuming I’m interpreting its language correctly.)

We’ve established that Spotify has comfortably planted itself at the polar opposite end of the businessspectrum from Bandcamp, yet for the sake of an oblivious adjudicating layman’s understanding, you’d haveyour work cut out for you explaining the difference between them: both are online marketplaces withgigantic libraries of digital music which a listener can browse, download locally, or stream from using Webbrowser or the mobile applications offered by each, respectively—and they can do from just about anywhere,for as much or as little as they wish. And—as the music industry and its satellites shall always remain for therest of humanity’s reign—both are overwhelmingly associated with young people. There, the crucial divideshould probably ring a bell—it’s been a constant between cultural generations for as long as culture, itselfhas existed. 
There are those among us who’s adolescent adoration of music is still completely valid as a very powerfulcomponent of hormonal development, yet doomed to quickly sizzle into casual listening or worse by the timeour post-secondary Senior year rolls around. And then, there are those on whom the curiosity clingsdevotedly on: the cool high school punk band-forming types our culture loves to romanticize, who’llinevitably end up bald and bespeckled with a pre-dawn community radio block. These Musicians, Crate-Diggers, and capital-A Audiophiles have historically overlapped in synonymous functions across a lovetriangle of dweebish intolerability, though it’s become especially easy as of late to forget that DIY recordingis by no means a recent development—its financial and technical barrier-to-entry has simply plummetedthanks to the developmental progression of Digital Audio Workstations and a growing industry of consumer-oriented audio equipment. For succinct insight into this dynamic, let’s refer to the pre-dialogue context in[Chuck Klosterman’s *GQ* interview](https://www.gq.com/story/jimmy-page-led-zeppelin-men-of-the-year­klosterman) with “the second- or the third-best rock guitarist of all time”—*Zinc Blimp* legend Jumbo Page. 
> The only thing Page really wants to talk about [is] the sound of the music, and how that sound wasachieved. He can talk about microphone placement for a very, very long time. Are you interested in having adetailed conversation about how the glue used with magnetic audiotape was altered in the late 1970s,subsequently leading to the disintegration of countless master tapes? If so, locate Jimmy Page. If a differentmusician obsessed over technological details with this level of exacting specificity, he would likely beclassified as a “nerd," as that has become a strange kind of compliment in the Internet age. People actuallywant to be seen as nerds. But that designation does not apply here. Jimmy Page does not seem remotelynerdy. 
Bandcamp’s core architecture was handbuilt from the beginning to handle the “hard part” for creators “sothat they didn’t have to be so nerdy,” which it, alone pioneered on the Web, becoming the best metadatamanagement utility for all time, but also committing to a traditional interpretation of music mediums that canfeel old fashioned in 2018. Despite having been around for a directly comparable length of time, SoundCloudhas maintained its relevance among friends in my network as the more socially-focused platform for keepingup with work from their peers thanks in large part to its exclusive, timestamp-oriented comment function,which allows for ultra-specific shortform feedback between fellow creators and fans. This is how thecompany has chosen to grow its community, which has lent especially to its strength in the most “nerdy”independent scenes: hip-hop and electronic music. The experience is busy by design and the divide betweenlistener and creator is next to non-existent—by now, the difference is universally irrelevant. External sharinghas also become a major strength since the inception of SoundCloud’s Web audio player, which was unlikeany other embeddable we’d ever seen at the time. Over the years, it’s become the most universally-supported means of embedding a track or playlist elsewhere, though the space has quite recently beganblooming with a few much slimmer Open Web offshoots like Vocaroo, Clyp, and Instaudio. 
While I can casually throw these names around for you in the same sized font, the gulfs between theproperties they denote are completely inexpressible in words. Because Spotify went public in Q1 of this year,they released [their first earnings report](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180502006667/en/)in April: 170 million active monthly users, $1.33 billion in total quarterly revenue, and $5.7-$6.2 billion inexpected total revenue for 2018. I’ll spare you the entire Forbes piece it would require to comprehensivelydemonstrate just how cavernous of a disparity canyon the industry represents. Early projects like Pandorawere docile, ad-free, and sincerely curious about the curatorial potential of music streaming services – *let’suse this cool new tech to play **music** for **anybody** with a Web browser if only because it’ll be ablast* – yet in that sense, they’ve all failed entirely. All except Bandcamp, anyway. 
“We started as a service to help artists sell their music and merchandise directly to their fans, but then asthe site grew—it’s now at about 12 million tracks and 1.5 million albums [as of 2014]—we evolved into alsobeing a destination for music Discovery,” he explains, partially anticipating the foot-to-the-floor transition tostreaming which has indeed shook the industry the hell up over the years since. The company's solution isminimal, elemental, yet uniquely alternative as only theirs could be: an idealized **digital interpretation of amusic collection**, which had actually launched a year before XOXO as part of “[Bandcamp for Fans](https://daily.bandcamp.com/2013/01/10/bandcamp-for-fans/).” That release notably introduced the abilityto “follow” both artist and fan accounts, the now-iconic “supported-by” section on release pages showingcustomers’ avatars and optional comments, and public wishlists. “I think it’s great to use a streaming servicefor music Discovery—they can be really really good for that,” Diamond [concedes](https://youtu.be/MaUkS­
lr-ZM?t=16m11s), before reiterating one of the several variations of Bandcamp’s founding premise thatcomposes his core argument: “if you actually care about music, and you care about the people who make it,and you want them to keep making it, the best way to do that is to buy directly from them, or to useservices that allow you to directly support them.” 
Instead of the “firehose”-like experience of a contemporary activity feed, “you’ve got a collection of albumsand tracks that people were passionate enough to spend money on.” For my personal use, Ethan lit up along-dormant incandescent bulb in my skull. My use of Bandcamp had long been to purchase and downloadmusic files, only—never to stream it—and there’s been good reason for this. While Bandcamp has formallysupported playback on iPhone and iPad in-browser since [July 2010](https://daily.bandcamp.com/2010/07/14/now-streaming-on-the-ipad-iphone/), actually using it for anysubstantial amount of playback has always been a souring endeavor. Considering that it’s persisted *to thisday*, we must concede that it is part of an intentional design rather than just an irritating flaw:**multitasking between apps or even browser tabs will prevent continuous playback of an album**, as willlocking the device. In order to move from track to track fluidly, one must keep the page with the in-useBandcamp player front and center. For three years, this was the only way to stream Bandcamp on mobile,but such capability was far from reliably expected by even the earliest adopters, then—3G data networkswere worse than you remember, anyway—and then in 2013, [the Bandcamp app was launched](https://daily.bandcamp.com/2013/10/25/its-over/) on iOS and Android, providing a sufficient fix in my bookat the time. (I’d rather any externally-embedded players I may engage with in an album review or artistprofile be limited to a single track, anyway.) However, the app itself remained quite mediocre for years,which was a tangible disappointment given how revolutionary their desktop experience had been when thecompany launched,but not necessarily a substantial deterrent to the sort of user they were attracting. 
I made a point to spend *a lot* of time engaging with Bandcamp’s service as much as possible – naturally,this included a trip back through [my neglected, digitally dusty Collection](http://bandcamp.com/davidblue),which proved a way more emotionally provocative experience than I anticipated. Ethan’s simple truth didn’treally sink in until I realized that this list is made up exclusively of my *real favorites*, and there’s not asingle track that is not inextricably and intoxicatingly tied to a specific era(s) of my life (yes, even that oneBlank Banshee album... I was 18, okay?) It’s absurdly powerful—not something I could engage with for anyextended time without becoming saturated with nostalgic gut stuff. (Listen for my upcoming specialcelebratory episode of [Extratone Radio](http://extratone.com/radio) to hear the best music I’ve foundthrough Bandcamp.) It hadn’t occurred to me that I would retain ownership and streaming rights to all musicI’ve purchased—including for a $0.00 sum, as I did for at least half of the works you see—even after anartist chose to delete or hide it on their own page. (Though they are not retained in my public collection, ofcourse.)

# The Discovery Debacle 
Pursuing an objective definition of “music Discovery” might appear foolish – an individual’s music taste isperhaps the most broadly angst-steeped realms of overwhelming subjectivity in modern American culture,after all – but its the pungent poignancy of our fundamental human relationship with sound, itself whichmakes the history of Discovery’s digitization so important (and fascinating.) If I were to ask you what youbelieve should be the single most important function that must be reliably performed by any “musicDiscovery” device – whether it be an application, Web service, magazine or even a crate-digging habit – thesingle factor which would render whole vague concept inert, irrelevant, and/or completely destroyed, howwould you answer? How would you interpret the question? 
It’s important we do well to take a considerable moment to cultivate a special wariness of the eggshellsbeneath our feet in this arena. Debatably at least a minim more than one’s taste in film, Americans fromGeneration X on forward until the end of time (I suspect) will hold “their” music as perhaps the most integralsupport upon which their identities are built throughout every stage of their lives. The intense sensation of ownership that propels this phenomenon within our culture leaves an especially sensitive passage ahead of us. 
As a wide-eyed teenager and infantile audio producer, I explored the idea of anti-music in my own entirelyBandcamp-supported project while I searched – aided tremendously by my expert best friend – for theedgiest, least sensical sounds and scenes on which to publicly attach on my identity in an opposing of“Discovery’s” extremes with fandom: **an obsessive, entirely-detached last-ditch skirmish between thecultural reality and my delusional pubescent need to be unique**. This process appears to be a universalrequisite in modern youth in one form or another, but it’s important now that I emphasize this confession: Iwas an especially ostentatious little backpacker fuck, but I’ve continued to find my shame well worthachieving a specific balance for music’s purpose in my life, and I’d anecdotally endorse its potential to relievecognitive dissonance at great scale. There’s only so much fun to be had blasting breakcore cassettes atdeafening, distorted volumes solely to bewilder rural overnight convenience store clerks on their smokebreaks in the wee hours or the bruteforce seizure of the speakers’ Bluetooth connection at a frat party just toplay harsh noise or anime-sampling Hardstyle while demonically shrieking – eyes rolled back – and lightingvarious parts of oneself ablaze before one realizes that 1) it’s they who end up looking like the idiots foraggressively breaching a group’s fun with inappropriate tunes (yes, no matter how interesting, rare, orunderrated they may be, Chadley;) 2) by ferally manifesting, you’ve deligitimized yourself, which 3) canseriously damage any future attempts to accomplish **the fundamental drive to share the gospel of music’svariety** out of your own rubish frustration with the differences between you. 
The real, sweetest truth is that **100% of all music has value potential** because of the medium’s broadinfluence on the human psyche. Pop music is amazing right now; the signature trap sound we devalued withDatpiff jokes made us all look like fools when it unconsciously transcended our “irony” and burrowed its ownhuge partition in our sincere hearts. After my pitiful attempt to reject and distance myself from my own ruralroots by scoffing at country music for years, I’ve made a beautiful peace with the childhood memories andthe historic excellence of Shania Twain and The Dixie Chicks in their mastery of both wholesome joy andcrippling nostalgia (I’ve even cried to Taylor Swift.) Yes, it’s been entirely reasonable all along to enjoy thestraightforwardly slothen pleasure in belching “Sweet Home Alabama” pounding cheap pissbeer on a foulpontoon boat on the Lake of the Ozarks, leaving my penultimate irony to confess that I’ve only found trueand serene identity through music after learning how to stop insisting so violently upon the worldly, one-of­a-kind superiority of my “taste.” 
That said, it’s still bewildering how content we are to abruptly abandon the substance music had to ourteenage selves out of misconstrued justifications for our classic fainéance – actively choosing to subject ourpublic ambiance to thousands of replays of “the best” records in favor of dipping even the most cowardly toeinto unfamiliar waters, even when the opportunity cost is inherently halved – only to then have the audacityto evangelize our dilapidated conceptions of “good music” to our children as we demonize the music of theirgeneration, depriving them of a very essential rite of their cognitive development. **I can think of little morereductive, repugnant, reckless, or racist crusades as a model figure than indoctrinating your child with aninherent distaste for their own culture**, and nothing more deeply alarming to hear from the mouth ofsomeone born in the 21st century than shit like “Queen was better than any rapper will ever be,” or “realmusicianship will die forever with Eric Clapton.” It’s unfair and unnatural: imagine if your high schoolclassmates had consistently turned up their scrunched nose at the living whole of rock & roll, declaring ScottJoplin to be the last musician they could stand. 
Consider if the industry-wide customer experience standard for the musical ambiance in 1970s Americaneating and drinking establishments was entirely comprised of works by John Phillip Souza, and the mostprevalent cultural revolution manifested itself something like the following: In countless popular films set inthe time (and the stories told today by your parents of their youths that informs them,) a group of popularhigh school boys – generally three longtime childhood friends and a single addition from the previoussummer with an Army Dad and a moderate bad boy aura that’s made him one of the school’s notoriouslyattractive students and the somewhat-abusive leader in the pack. After spending some time trying toconvince the other three (the crucial moment for his case being the bad kid’s rare moment of sincerity trope)of its guaranteed social, sexual and financial ROI, they seal their agreement to start a band with a four-waysaliva slap. Imagine if in the progression of this exhausted old tale, it remained entirely classic (and boring)when it faded to a “THREE MONTHS LATER...” ceiling shot of the four the in full, gleaming, performance­spec get-up of the presidential marching band in their garage, and it was revealed that they’d they practiced“The Star Spangled Banner” every night just to make the girls swoon in the film’s resolution with an encoreof “America the Beautiful” at an unsanctioned (and very patriotic!) house party. 
Suffice it to say that it’s absolutely fucking bonkers how often I encounter “Sweet Home Alabama” (andother tunes I’ve already heard hundreds of times throughout the first third of my existence, conservatively)dripping down from the overhead speakers in all manner of big retail stores, where it’s inappropriate andunwelcome. Even from the generous assumption that every single one of them is an objective masterwork ofcomposition, the amount of affection the American music listening audience has for the same 500 singles ison par with our rampant gun violence in terms of our unanimous tolerance for ridiculously illogical habits.I’ve been sitting in a cute, moderately trendy coffee shop on the corner of the major avenue of access to mycute, moderately trendy Portland neighborhood for an hour now, and I’ve recognized every single one of thetracks played just a bit too loudly on the stereo. I’ve been sick of them all since Middle School. That one BowBow Chicka Chicka thing… How very charming. 
“*The 70s, the 80s… the one-hit wonder channel!”* 
Contrary to the popular hipster narrative we’ve just defeated, it’s not the popularity of the lineup that makesthese experiences so distasteful, but their *regularity*. It doesn’t take a doctor of psychology to observethat tireless exposure to any given work of art inevitably erodes its value, yet we continue to expendresources saturating most mundane spaces in our society with an unyielding regurgitation of the samebrackish pop culture symbols as if we’re *trying* to either induce a canonical vomit, intentionally obliteratethe Yelp! reviews for a distant future museum’s “North America Enters the 21st Century” exhibit, or *both*.After failing my best attempts to elaborate with historical analogy citing a past event, I’m afraid we mustpivot to a science fiction-esque nanonarrative containing obnoxiously speculative hypotheticals, instead. 
**Imagine**: It’s 2036 – four years after we found out we are not alone in the universe when a significantlymore advanced civilization makes formal first contact with humanity by sending a party of diplomats,anthropologists, and explorers (who were actually getting ready to go in 2016 before getting word of theTrump presidency and deciding we weren’t quite ready just yet) who land their space egg right in front ofthe United Nations’ New York City headquarters and expressing something to the tune of *hey so um… wenoticed you guys moved in and we just wanted to stop by and say hi*, entirely altering humanity’s self-perception and future trajectory (see: works by Gene Roddenberry) yadda yadda. The visitors expressed awish to begin a cultural exchange project with us, and it’s just now coming to fruition… I have only momentsago made history in the eyes of the entire world when I walked through the front door of a Target store insuburban New Jersey leading a hovering hyper-intelligent silicon-based sphere of agender mist (roughlycomparative to a basketball in size,) who’s already both impressing and shaming me tremendously as wemove by the in-store Starbucks. From above us, Semisonic’s “Closing Time” is belched upon my life’sproudest moment and my guest requests we pause to discuss it, to my profound horror. 
“The sound from the reproduction devices embedded above us...” the android translator trails off for amoment. “It is the same noise that was distantly reproduced 51 hours ago in ‘Miami’ as I conversed withAmbassador Phillip Defranco about ‘the setting sun’ on the ‘beach,’ coming from a small open air structurewhich he defined as ‘a surf shop,’ which was occupied by a young male who appeared to be moderatelyagitated, moving about in jagged strides as he wildly smacked the foundational surface with ‘a broom.’ TheAmbassador explained the youth was likely nearing the end of his allotted period of daily occupational labor.” 
Blood is flooding my cheeks as I listen with a building dread to the robot’s interpretation, awash with allmanner of embarrassment for my species. 
“Is the purpose of this noise reproduction of a logistical nature, or is it perhaps a common ritual withinbusiness and/or working class culture?” 
<iframe style="border: 0; width: 100%; height: 120px;"src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=2309125545/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=00006b/tracklist=false/artwork=small/track=2334991176/transparent=true/" seamless><ahref="http://ripswirl.bandcamp.com/album/possessed">Possessed by RIP Swirl</a></iframe> Now, it’s your turn to be the human representative in this pico science fiction: you’re now obligated toconfirm the alien anthropologist’s hypothesis and explain that “Closing Time” is but one piece of recordedmusic among billions of diverse expressive works across millennia. You must reverently describe how the“universal language” of math within melodious composition has long been a hefty buzzword in the popculture conversations about interstellar communication and our longtime search for extraterrestrialintelligence from the future-thrilled 90s—S.E.T.I.’s glory days – when we felt pretty damned good aboutspace. The historic launch of the United Nations’ “greetings on behalf of the people of our planet” etchedinto [The Golden Record](https://www.npr.org/2017/09/30/554489944/the-voyager-golden-record-finally­finds-an-earthly-audience) aboard *Voyager I* and Jodie Foster’s novel portrayal of a S.E.T.I. scientist in theiconic Carl Sagan-sourced 1997 science fiction drama *Contact* are among the globally-celebrated Best Hitsof humanism (not to mention the organization listed on your paystubs,) and they weigh a billion tons on you,now—in the most significant moment of your entire life, bar none – as you explain on behalf of your speciesto **real** extraterrestrial intelligence the reality of how negligent it is actually is of the culture the Recordclaimed to treasure. The worst part, though? The entire experience is accompanied by a nasal-as-hellSemisonic soundtrack. 
Aren’t you *frustrated*? You should be, but it’s not over yet: inevitably, your round fictional companion ofnote is going to follow up their query with some seriously burning meat. 
“Just a half-generation ago, your utopian dream of a globally-connected world – in which everyone would beempowered to saturate and culture themselves with new ideas and forms of expression – was the definingaspiration of your society, and yet you’ve definitively achieved Total Connectivity, now, and caused theoverwhelmingly opposite result: you’re all intolerable shitheads who every passing solar orbit become lessand less capable of anything but regurgitation of the same foul bullshit. Y’all fucking wack. I’m out. ” 
And there, that filthy little ball would have us all. Friends, colleagues, human siblings of mine, **it’s long-past time we expect better from ourselves** as music citizens of the world. Even the longest living of us areendowed with very little opportunity to absorb anything more than an infinitesimal fraction of all there is toexperience, and we’ve all been carelessly and embarrassingly chucking it to the weeds. If it this all seemsexcessive, there’s no need to feel attacked, but for Pete’s sake… please stop claiming you “like music”because it’s misleadingly inaccurate and I’ll promise never to use the phrase “music citizens of the world”again, in exchange. 
# Distribution & Curation 
**You, your friends, and I are missing out on way too much cool shit** and we’re going to continueaddressing possible causes and solutions to this ongoing catastrophe without asking for a single movedfinger on your part because we are fucking saints. Let’s come back to ground and consider a casual real-world use case for a streaming service which I’ve observed. 
*It’s just after 1PM on an especially beautiful Summer day in 2018, and you’ve decided with your two bestfriends that an impromptu hot dog barbecue in your little apartment’s parking lot would be a great way tospend the afternoon. You get on Facebook Messenger – no time to bother with the formality of creating anevent – and begin to bother your group of art school friends. In a few hours, you’ve set up chairs in a circlearound the borrowed fire pit, gathered meat tubes, marshmallows, and beer, and your guests have begun toarrive. The next step: retrieve your cordless Bluetooth speaker from inside to place it atop a log nearest thescene, re-pair it with your smartphone, and ___?* 
Let’s acknowledge that music has incredibly diverse purposes of value in human life—*of course* I realizethis—and ultimately, nobody can dictate those fulfilled for another individual by any given track, album,artist, or genre across time and setting. Even splittercore-obsessed serial killers and body moddingcybergrind disciples are doomed: inevitably, they will one day let their guard down and find themselvessinging along with “Goodbye Earl” on the radio way off key, smiling like a doofus. Even if one hateshumanity, they will eventually be forced to acknowledge that The Dixie Chicks came very close to itspenultimate manifestation. 
I understand that it’s not *always* time for something new for everyone, but you’re missing out on music’smost worthwhile function by far if you never seek anything fresh, and—if you still find yourself unwilling tobother, even—carrying around even the slightest bit of anecdotal knowledge about *what’s going on* inmusic with you can be invaluably culturing to your image when socializing with youths and alienintelligences, alike. There is a spectrum of enthusiasm (or pretentiousness, depending on one’s ownsubjectives) for music that is far more culturally consequential than the practice of partaking and/orpatroning any other artform. Settle comfortably on any point – extreme or not – and you’re at serious risk ofbeing uncool. Nobody wants Anthony Fantano showing up to their party, but if you live too long confusingthe Beach Boys with the Beatles – as I have – folks start to behave as if there’s something wrong with you.If it helps, let’s suppose this to be the *real* reason behind my need to discuss Bandcamp – perhaps itsrelative lack of aged or worshiped-at-scale work justifies it all. 
By this nature, its effort is designed to bracket the enthusiast as wholly as possible, but the value most inneed of its experience has become its comparatively extravagant hospitality for the dabbler. The“[Discoverinator](https://daily.bandcamp.com/2012/06/07/behold-the-glory-of-the-discoverinator/)” (Iwould’ve voted for calling it “Genre-Fucker”) is simply *the* most ingenious tool available anywhere to filtermusic by genre, subgenre, location, and medium. Or at least... It’s too gorgeous not to be. Thanks to itsrecent visual redesign, I don’t even care if it’s useful—it’s just a beautiful thing to play with on both the Weband the iOS app (though I’d bet they were each crafted separately.) 
<iframe width="auto" height="auto" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SOaEAR9Da70?controls=0"frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"allowfullscreen></iframe> 
Front and center on the homepage is the [Bandcamp Daily](http://daily.bandcamp.com/) – a showcase offeatures, lists, albums of the day, and artist interviews from various staff and guest contributors which I’dmost certainly judge befit of a standalone publication – and the [*Bandcamp Weekly*](https://bandcamp.com/?show) – an extraordinarily-produced podcast like no other with special mixes, guestappearances, and commentary which the company’s [Chief Curator Andrew Jervis](https://bandcamp.com/andrewjervis) has been honing [since 2013](http://bandcamp.com/?show=1) over289 episodes as of [this morning](http://bandcamp.com/?show=289). Its player functions both in-browserand on the iOS app unlike any I’ve ever seen, with a list of embedded tracks that pop out when they’reactually spinning on the show so that you can engage further with them, if you wish. It’s difficult to describe,but it feels visually like you’re listening to a playlist in Bandcamp’s normal player, except tracks areintermixed and faded between one another beneath the host’s commentary, so the audio itself must be pre­rendered. Regardless, it’s nearly as extraordinary an achievement in Web design as the program itself is incuratorial music broadcasting. I’m no addict to the genre, but I have yet to Discover another similar productwhich I can binge episode after episode for hours without becoming bored or irritated as I can the*Bandcamp Weekly*’s. 
To fill in the parking lot party blank with a single streaming solution for the sake of our young, art school-attending, likely more musically-literate than average summer barbecue guests—how viable is Bandcamp?Truthfully, it’s only slightly more suited now than it was in its earliest infancy for obediently filling a spacewith ambiance. We could ponder whether or not its design discourages absentminded playback onlyconsequently, or perhaps condescendingly from the high, white tower of hipster elitism on which you’lloccasionally hear it accused of perching, but UX design is *the* most ridiculous sphere within which tointenspeculate in lieu of verification (gazing at you with the timeless grace of a thousand moons, *Medium,*)so lets hold off to seek out an interview with a Bandcamp representative. 
SoundCloud would be a bit closer to the mark—it can be configured to simply *keep going* after you’vefinished a track, regardless of where you may be within the interface (excluding the embedded player, ofcourse)—but it’d be much safer to spend the smidgen of extra time required to find a manmade playlist.Letting it loose will quickly land you on some seriously dubious (and probably embarrassing) nerd shit. As Iunderstand it, YouTube has long been the go-to houseparty music player because of its universality,Chromecast support, and (obviously) visual component for accompanying music videos, so its new, ad-free[YouTube Music service](https://djmag.com/content/youtube-launches-youtube-music-and-youtube­premium-streaming-services) has a lot of potential, in theory, but we’re *outside* in this scenario and our smartphone is our only playback device. 
Startlingly, the Web’s given best answer to this situation is still Spotify in all of its culture-diluting gluttony.*Internet radio*? Yikes. You can still find a gem of a stream every once in a while, but they’re usuallyunreliable and probably abandoned, so the catalog won’t last you more than a few hours before you’ll startto hear repeats. You could search out the internet stream of your favorite radio station—a *student* radiostation, even—but those offering the most entertaining programming are unlikely to have a suitable playliston a summer afternoon. So—forgetting its overwhelming financial funneling toward its top 10% andeverything else for a moment—why not just give up the pretense and use Spotify? Again, for most of myfriends, it works just fine to play Cat Stevens, Run DMC, Gorillaz or The Rolling Stones, but I have yet tofigure out a combination of keywords to keep it on target within even the most rudimentary parameters.Such ill-restraint becomes especially dire—necessary, really—when I queue up “Cannibal Ox Radio” for theoffice and R Kelly ends up playing, 20 minutes in. Using personally-targeted artist bans is probably toosubjective to ask of such a service in the spotlight, but **how about an option to filter out white rappers**?(I hope you didn’t blink because that’s by far my best contribution in tech writing yet.)

The truth is, I’d probably end up calling upon Apple Music as I’ve been an on-and-off subscriber since itsrelease, but have yet to meet a single fellow user. The girth of its catalog is [reportedly still nearly ](https://9to5mac.com/2018/05/06/apple-music-vs-spotify/)[25% larger](https://9to5mac.com/2018/05/06/apple-music-vs-spotify/), its UI is significantly more cohesively integratedwith iOS (which hasn’t always been a given from Apple with its music software, mind you,) yet it costs meprecisely the same $9.99 a month as Spotify Premium would. If I *did* know somebody else who used it,they’d be able to see [my public profile](http://bit.ly/dbapple) including my playlists and activity, just as myfollowers on Spotify can, and I can create “Stations” for artists that function similarly to Spotify’s endlessadaptive playlists, but—crucially, for myself—after the app’s redesign for iOS 10, the integration of AppleMusic music with my own iTunes library is completely seamless. With unlimited data, I’ve selected the optionto refrain from storing music locally, which further diminishes the distinction between “my” music and themusic I’ve paid for the rights to stream. Fundamentally, the end result is that I pay ten bucks a month for“ownership” of *all* the music on iTunes proper. 
While I might personally play *Bandcamp Weekly* episodes in such a context and gladly accept whateverresults I’d get, I’d only do so acknowledging the subsequently increased risk of some vest-wearing fuck I’venever met springing out of the bushes to accost me about Weird Allan. However, I am neither cool normusically literate, which makes me particularly vulnerable to misusing algorithmic Discovery—the practice inwhich artificial intelligence has become most widely-deployed which continues to prove itself to betterdeserve the term “automated wallowing,” or “robotized ear rot.”

Ironically, Damon Krukowski’s aforementioned “responsibility” essay on *Pitchfork* openly cites Liz Pelly’sburning-hot and [100%](https://thebaffler.com/salvos/the-problem-with-muzak-pelly)[ essential analysis](https://thebaffler.com/salvos/the-problem-with-muzak-pelly) of algorithmically-generated playlists for *TheBaffler* notes the publication’s own substantial relationship with Spotify, including a [Webby Award-winning](https://www.webbyawards.com/winners/pitchfork-spotify-inside-discovery/) advertorial series called *InsideDiscovery*, which the two collaborate to produce that’s “meant to boost awareness of the ‘Discover Weekly’feature.” 
> The series shows Pitchfork editors (and favored musicians) gushing about their love of streaming—the 
immediacy! The deep back catalogs! One editor says it helps him keep track of his listening habits, whileanother rejoices at not having to dig through crates at record shops anymore. Yet another likens Spotify towalking around a music festival, discovering something new at every turn. What does it mean for “the mosttrusted voice in music” to celebrate an algorithm as preferable to its own crate digging? What does it meanwhen the tastemaking humans endorse data-driven machines? What does it mean when the algorithmsbecome cool? Virtually every music publication now relies on Spotify media players to embed songs withinonline articles, and Websites like Pitchfork and Rolling Stone regularly celebrate their playlists with listicles:“Ten Albums To Stream Now.” “The Five Playlists You Need to Hear This Summer.” 
We love bespoke Open Web projects, so exploring *Inside Discovery*’s (surely bespoke) experience inducedthe same pathetic sort of *I wish business just incentived building nice things* disappointment which hasbecome my default, bitchy mood, and blaming as a further let down to immediately land on [Mitski’s ](https://insidediscovery.pitchfork.com/playlist-mitski)[playlist](https://insidediscovery.pitchfork.com/playlist­mitski), to whom I’d just been [reintroduced](https://pitchfork.com/features/profile/dont-cry-for-mitski/) (by*Pitchfork*, admittedly) after happening upon her performance at Pitchfork 2017 (which is organized,admittedly, by *Pitchfork*.) 
Upon a brief review of these once-petty desires and the new, apocalyptic solutions which we are burningbarns full of cash to develop, it would appear that the overwhelmingly defining feature of those which are atall viable remains to be the interference of a human being, and why wouldn’t it be, still, when manual musicaggregation remains so desperately cheap? I’d wager heavily that there’s at least a single editor within AppleMusic who’s spent serious time embedded in the Berlin techno scene considering how regularly the prime“Techno” playlist is updated with new work of a moderately-industrial bias. 
“The downside to automated music Discovery is that we’re encouraged to develop a taste profile and stick toit,” [opines somebody on *Pigeons & Planes*](https://pigeonsandplanes.com/in-depth/2016/03/music­discovery-algorithms), complimenting Pelly in their profile of former BBC Radio 1 host, Zane Lowe, and hisnew job curating an Apple Music playlist? 
The truth is, the stories that come to us that smell the strongest of philanthropy on the surface are oftenactually about some dusty, Y2K-lookin’-ass nerd with powerfully tedious grievances and too much time ontheir hands. The whole world knows the details by now of how Mark Zuckerberg’s horny social ineptitude ledto Facebook’s conception, but we must both keep in check the bad habit we share – the whole present-dayreading world and I, that is – of dwelling entirely too much on the most “negative,” soul-agitating tales inwhat we perceive to be the pursuit of necessary ingredients for concocting a better solution. Bandcamp’sstory is predominantly comprised of smart decisions, sincere transparency, and savvy ideas which are bestexamined in contrast, I’m afraid, with all that’s being done *wrong* everywhere else. 
> Are my favorite punk bands now Bandcamp bands? Are they suddenly wanting to conform to a kind ofBandcamp aesthetic? I don’t think so. Not yet. But if that does happen, something might be lost — a senseof these bands defining themselves as they want to, which is sort of the Bandcamp promise in the first place.People can use help navigating the riches of Bandcamp. But its estimable editorial project opens aninteresting question: When does help turn into tastemaking? 
# The Creators 
You missed it, didn’t you—the ten-year anniversary of Bandcamp’s launch? Ashamed, I realized last monththat I did, too. Ashamed, because I owe a lot to to the platform’s unwavering commitment to the distributionand curation of work made by just about all of my favorite artists—within and outside of my social network.Throughout 2015, I hosted a number of conversations with exceptional, future-looking creators on *Drycast*which I am especially proud of. On one [early episode](https://anchor.fm/extratone/episodes/Juke-Master­Samantha-Carter-and-the-Producers-Extravaganza-e1neqc/a-a4674c) with an exceptional total of *seven*music makers, I observed in a beat that “all of us have Bandcamp accounts,” before the week’s guest,Samantha Carter, suggested that she’d found her page especially financially rewarding, and originated theconcept of the “Bandcamp Sugar Daddy” (which I personally ship 100%.)

“It's something I take for granted,” said my friend [yzome](https://twitter.com/yzome) – a [truly one-of-a­kind electronic producer](https://yzome.bandcamp.com/) who’s far-traveling composition is probably theclosest Digital Audio Workstation equivalent of Extreme Use Testing—when automotive manufacturerseffectively torture new prototypes with the most inhospitable conditions on Earth until they break. However,it’s not a PR stunt in yzome’s case—he’s just very good at doing what he does after doing it for nearly 10years—and his end product requires a hell of a lot more than any one genre would ever presume, but itmore than delivers back on the investment with significant interest. 
When [he appeared on *Drycast*](https://anchor.fm/extratone/episodes/Electronic-Producer-Yzome-and­his-Alien-Sound-e1lmcj/a-a41qc5) in January 2015, we failed to achieve any descriptors more sophisticatedthan “alien sounds,” but perhaps that’s all they need: the inner worlds into which yzome invites us are ofmanic, unpredictable arrhythmia which poses an unapologetic, yet magically lighthearted challenge to anycohesive theory. It’s very rare that his proudly-ungenreable exploration of the fringes does not demand thelistener’s full attention, yet it always manages to be *inoffensively aggressive* like **nothing** else, whichsuggesting promise for the possible upheaval of a long-upheld natural law among electronic dance music:yzome doesn’t need to be a shithead to challenge the listener intellectually. 
<iframe style="border: 0; width: 100%; height: 120px;"src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=586326190/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=00006b/tracklist=false/artwork=small/track=641807133/transparent=true/" seamless><ahref="http://yzome.bandcamp.com/album/yvette">YVETTE by yzome</a></iframe> 
Play *[YVETTE](https://yzome.bandcamp.com/album/yvette)* for any boomer you know with that classicallyimpenetrable disgust for *all* electronic music, and you’ll witness firsthand how special yzome’s particularinnovation truly is. No, they’re not going to be *sexually liberated*, or anything—it’s still going to bealarming—but you’ll notice that the swift and overwhelming fury which sample and break-heavy dance musichas always awoken within them has been miraculously circumvented. Instead of immediately storming off,they’ll be paralyzed in an existential fugue state from which they may never quite fully emerge. I’ve seen itfirsthand. It’s witchcraft. 
There is no other across the (especially-wide) electronic spectrum who can so loudly go so far, so fastwithout any insincerity, whatsoever. His arrangement seems mischievous and all over the place, but reallylisten and you’ll hear rips of recognizable patterns playing peekaboo in willy-nilly bursts that reveal hisdynamic mastery of the dance music space through Breakcore, Juke, Footwork, and Techno sampling. All ofthis is to say, really, that yzome’s music represents a level of boundary-pushing which only a niche audiencetends to truly appreciate, yet is undoubtedly worthy of an elegantly-presented host like Bandcamp. 
"Like thank god I don't have to look for a label to release this. It's seen as a legitimate platform (by peoplewho might actually care about what I’m doing, at least,) which I think is less offputting than uploadingthings to Mediafire or whatever else. It’s populist and boutique at the same time." 
***Populist, yet boutique***. Can we really be expected to exceed this summation? Well, nobody’s saidmuch at all in the mainstream press, but what *has* been said is 1) unusually misplaced in the spaces ofthose least likely to find it relevant and 2) *way* more insightful than you’d expect. 
“Bandcamp has an independent-artist identity because of practicalities: Independent artists from Web-centered subcultures need it most,” observed an especially savvy online aside from by [Ben Ratliff](http://benratliff.net/)—jazz and pop critic for *The New York Times—*asking “[Is Bandcamp the Holy Grailof Online Record Stores](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/20/arts/music/bandcamp-shopping-for­music.html)?” So why aren’t we talking about it? The other important takeaway: founder Ethan Diamond toldRatliff that “the company has never spent money on promotion.” This is largely why I’ve invested so muchtime and affection into this piece—gratitude is not often sellable incentive for mainstream coverage. 
The truth is, the continued obscurity of Bandcamp’s story despite all it’s done comes down not to any malpractice by the company (in fact, it would likely be more visible had it fucked up more,) or even to itsprevalence in the careers of big industry names (whom I will address in detail shortly,) but because it simplyoperates too magnanimously for its customers to be taken seriously as a newsworthy business, which isproblematic and personally infuriating. In November, 2015, Bandcamp made mention in *The New Yorker*via the openly diminutive context of *Car Seat Headrest’s* [origin story](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/02/growth-spurt-pop-music-hua-hsu), describing it as “acharming alternative,” and “a casual, low-risk approach.” Granted, it’s worth noting that the platform did notaddress its lack of “editorial guidance” until a year later, with the [launch](https://daily.bandcamp.com/2016/06/13/welcome-to-bandcamp-daily/) of the excellent *Bandcamp Daily*blog, but I think you’ll agree it’s in poor taste to argue against the legitimacy of a *music* distributionplatform because it’s *too democratic.* Perhaps it’s still just beyond reasonable expectations to get a top-of­the-foodchain music writer’s head wrapped around the idea that such products on The Internet can easily—even optimally—service both hobbyists and professionals. 
Last year, Bandcamp was responsible for [$270 million in payments](https://daily.bandcamp.com/2018/02/12/the-bandcamp-2017-year-in-review/) to artists like Jlin,the geniuscommonly associated with Footwork (certainly Chicago’s most underreported and popularlyunderrepresented movement,) for pushing its expressive boundaries both in theory and geography furtherthan any other, and who’s so far produced two of the most “[aggressively](https://noisey.vice.com/en_us/article/qvv37m/jlin-is-making-the-most-aggressively-beautiful-music-youve­ever-heard)[ beautiful](https://noisey.vice.com/en_us/article/qvv37m/jlin-is-making-the-most-aggressively­beautiful-music-youve-ever-heard)” records you’ll find anywhere in the process.[[i\]](#_edn1) Type hername into any search engine and her Bandcamp page is *always* the first result, yet Cntrl-Fing for“Bandcamp” will yield 0 results from her interviews with *The Fader*, *FACT Magazine*, *Pitchfork*, *TheSeventh Hex*, *Passion of the Weiss*, *PopMatters*, *Crack Magazine*, *DUMMY*, *The Guardian*, *TheQuietus*, *BOMB Magazine*, *Ableton Blog*, *The Creative Independent*, *Rolling Stone*, *SPIN*, *NoFear of Pop*, *self-titled magazine*, *Circulation Magazine*, *The New Yorker*, *Cyclic Defrost*,*Mixmag*, or *melting bot*, and only one in *Interview Magazine*. To be clear: I am **not** arguing thatJlin—a black female music artist—should be profusely thanking Bandcamp—a service founded largely bywhite male programmers—for hosting her most visible page but rather that the more independent of thesepublications, especially, should mention its role in her story or—at the very least—be hyperlinking to [herBandcamp page](https://jlin.bandcamp.com/) first, for both her’s and their readers’ sake—Bandcamp’s cut ofalbum purchases is half of iTunes. From the user experience perspective, it’s absurd that those of thesepages including embedded music players chose to use SoundCloud’s—which is more resource heavy (yet ofnoticeably lesser streaming playback quality) and visually disruptive—instead of [Bandcamp’s](https://daily.bandcamp.com/2013/06/12/all-new-players-up-twitter-too/). 
<iframe style="border: 0; width: auto; height: auto;"src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=2765736108/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=00006b/tracklist=false/transparent=true/" seamless><a href="http://jlin.bandcamp.com/album/black-origami">BlackOrigami by Jlin</a></iframe> 
The two services were launched the same year—that fateful 2008—but comparing them is complicated. Theyare clear opposites in at least one principal: how they’ve defined their mission. Bandcamp has changed lessthroughout its history than any other Web service that comes to mind (see below,) but SoundCloud hasstruggled with identity issues, to their vastly-superior success (in terms of user statistics, anyway.) *The NewYork Times* [reported in June, 2011](https://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/06/15/soundcloud-an-audio­sharing-site-hits-5-million-users/) that they’d reached 5 million users, citing their decision to expand focusbeyond “popular music” to explain the milestone. “We’re building a sound platform that’s not just aboutmusic,” said Alex Ljung – a SoundCloud co-founder and the company’s chief executive at the time – and itspresent landscape certainly reflects a diverse offering of uses, but ultimately, any . Today, both SoundCloudand Bandcamp have premium subscription plans for artists which are at least *perceived* to be competitivewith one another—[SoundCloud Pro](https://blog.soundcloud.com/2013/03/11/introducing-soundcloud-pro/)and [Bandcamp Pro](https://daily.bandcamp.com/2012/06/25/new-features-up/), respectively—along withfree base experiences, which we’ll compare first. 
**Free Bandcamp Account  Uploads**: quantity unlimited, size of each file limited to 291mb.
**Distribution**: unlimited streaming, up to 200 free downloads per month. 
**Free SoundCloud Account
 Uploads**: total of 3 hours uploaded at any given time.
**Distribution**: unlimited streaming, unlimited downloads. 
Both offer access “basic” statistics for their tracks at this tier which most of the creators I know consider more than enough—the usefulness of any playback/download stats is negligible when you’re publishingwithin tight niches—and each has had about 5 years to fine-tune their free offerings so that they feel ascomplete as possible. If you’re planning on publishing a podcast on SoundCloud, you’re obviously going tohave to upgrade your upload limit even beyond Pro ($8/month, 6-hour upload limit) to Pro Unlimited($16/month, unlimited uploads,) though I would suggest a plethora of alternative methods before you gotthat far. Unfortunately, they would not include a free Bandcamp account. While [there ](https://bandcamp.com/?g=podcasts&s=top&p=0&gn=0&f=all&w=0#discover)*are* [podcasts onBandcamp](https://bandcamp.com/?g=podcasts&s=top&p=0&gn=0&f=all&w=0#discover), they’recompletely separate the platform’s aspirations and without support for the basic requirements of podcastdistribution (namely, RSS feeds.) 
Bandcamp’s Pro option is $10 a month and includes a custom domain, batch file uploading, privatestreaming (for press and/or fans) plus the ability to disable *free* streaming (requiring listeners to actuallybuy the music to enable any playback,) ad-free video hosting (which nobody uses, to my knowledge,)extended fan interaction tools, and a broader statistics suite that includes Google Analytics support.SoundCloud’s Pro and Pro Unlimited options are complimentary, but a full-time independent artist couldjustify maintaining Pro accounts on both services or neither—one does not necessarily replace the other, butthe contrast in their chosen presentations has led to a divide in the cultures of the two communities so stark[it could be a punchline](http://www.thefader.com/2017/04/03/bandcamp-artists-vs-soundcloud-artists­meme) and/or simplified to say that *SoundCloud is for rap* and *Bandcamp is not*. 
It’s not entirely shocking, then, that SoundCloud’s story has been more present in the greater conversationthan Bandcamp’s. Frankly, its largest issues are directly related: compared to SoundCloud, **Bandcamp’scommunity is White As Fuck** (a claim I can only make on behalf of my own observations and those whicha select few creators have seen fit to express to me over the years, considering that the company has yet torelease any demographic information about its creators) which is a glaringly fundamental obstruction to theproject’s broader mission to help music culture “[thrive](https://bandcamp.com/about).” 
From a future historian’s perspective, the battle for the definitive name in independent digital musicdistribution has already won, largely thanks to its relationship with Chance The Rapper, who’s quicklybecome a “cultural influencer, thought leader, global star,” and one of my generation’s upmost celebritychampions. Obviously, there is little sense trying to determine whether SoundCloud *earned* his partnershipor landed their popular association with his name as long as the artist maintains it publicly, while continuingto [give new meaning](https://soundcloud.com/pitchfork/pitchfork-presents-in-sight-out-chance-the-rapper)to the phrase “serially likable.” Thus far, his mythical power to exude purity has felt virtually 100% airtightLast year, his second album *Coloring Book* made history when it won the [first streaming-only ](https://www.engadget.com/2017/02/12/chance-the-rapper-first-streaming-only-grammy/)[Grammy for BestAlbum](https://www.engadget.com/2017/02/12/chance-the-rapper-first-streaming-only-grammy/). In mypersonal favorite moment in recent popular culture memory, the fashionable-as-hell young man [acceptedthe accolade](https://youtu.be/FkAJ_BU66Zs) by looking the whole industry establishment in the face andproclaiming “this is for every indie artist—everybody who’s been doin’ this mixtape shhhh...*tuff* for a longass time... shouts out to every independent artist out there; [shouts out to SoundCloud for holding medown](https://www.theverge.com/2017/2/12/14594672/chance-the-rapper-grammy-awards-2017­soundcloud).” Obviously, such significant, sentimental, and sincere sentiments are *never* expressed abouttech companies by beloved darlings of the art world like Chance—especially not for Earth-encompassingawards show audiences. 
After [last year’s massive layoff](https://www.theverge.com/2017/7/6/15928674/soundcloud-cuts-40­percent-staff), it was [Chance’s assurances] 
(https://twitter.com/chancetherapper/status/885921220759355397) that “SoundCloud is here to stay” whichthe public took to heart. Even if the company *is* destined to fail within the next year (it appears to be asyet missing much of a verdict,) and it’s all still destined to fold at any moment, at least it’ll have the distinctpride of doing so having maintained his publicly-expressed respect and confidence, which is a damned finelegacy in my book. Meanwhile, Bandcamp has only made a few small tweaks to its basic infrastructure, andadded new features very deliberately, which haven’t resulted in a single memorable controversy. Aside from[Amanda Palmer](https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2010/07/amanda-palmer-sells-15k-on­bandcampin-three-minute.html), perhaps, there has never been a single band or artist who’ve been knownas “from Bandcamp,” leaving our only pitch to be something like *Independent Online Music Platform onTrack to Complete 10th Year Serving Small-Time Artists, Continues to Look Pretty Good*.

Considering the significance of these contributions, it’s of a special wonder that they were made not by anon-profit organization, academic movement, or government endowment, but by a for-profit, California-based tech company that’s continued to thrive and innovate great content, entirely apart from mainstream coverage.

# The Future 
It might seem a bit much on the surface, but in many ways, Bandcamp has spent the past 10 years showingus what a for-profit, Web-based, culturally-edging independent platform Can be, even in the Valley. 
Though Bandcamp has embarked upon unusually sparse explanation of its editorial directive in the *Daily*blog and *Weekly* podcast, but regularly consume either for any length of time, and you’ll notice aparticular savvy for Discovering technically-progressive Afrocentric projects: “[Black Experimental Music](https://daily.bandcamp.com/2016/08/05/a-guide-to-black-experimental-music/).” 
On [last week’s episode](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/19/podcasts/still-processing-tin-house­inclusion-hannah-gadsby.html) of the excellent *New York Times* podcast *Still Processing*, co-host JenaWortham “I’m thinking a lot about ways in which new culture, new cultural products, new cultural creatorscome to light in ways that sidestep these traditional means and don’t have to go through the traditionallyvery white, very male, very cis, very hetero hoops to prove worthiness.” 
So, our greatest hope for the decentralization of the music industry in the 1990s ended up transformingbefore us to become the most effectively divisive Discovery barrier ever known to man because of itspsychological influence sub-threshold at unprecedented scale over time, in parallel with so many other likehorrific monstrosities we’ve discovered in anguish to be mutants of those final salvations from our atrocioushistory which we’d been so relieved to believe in. Surely, the turn of the millennia was destined to be ourfinal turning point – the moment we’d finally use our new technology to discover a truth (or maybe just areally good clue,) that’d immediately unite our species in a deafening, worldwide aha moment when it wouldreveal a general abstract of whatever the fuck our deal was that was preventing our silent, dutiful, and100% harmonious collective effort toward a utopia like *Star Trek: The Next Generation*’s, in which anyoneis absolutely free of obligation or desperation from birth to pursue… whatever with their time.

#software #music # Software Thanksgiving 
![Digital Leaves](https://i.snap.as/SFHmuSlu.png) 
## Purposing a disciplined effort to reflect on those tech products which have remained too fair and/or toogood to catch the attention of the alarmists in us, recently. 
I've never been a big fan of holidays, nor do I think Thanksgiving should be a federal one, given its shitty,undebatably imperialist origins, but these opinions are entirely inconsequential. Regardless of how I feel,Thanksgiving will remain as pervasive as ever in the spaces around me, so I thought I'd change things upthis year and *actually participate* in a substantial way. I did my best to travel back to a vastly lesscomplicated self, letting all of the crud that's accumulated atop my love of computers in the past twentyyears: wokeness, adtech, Obama wearing VR glasses, etc... When I thought the Native Americans were*glad* to see white people because they gave them guns and horses and assumed people made thingsbecause good ideas were the apex of currency. When I was able to respond to new software discoveries byscrewing around aimlessly without wondering if they'd been stolen entirely from a handful of talenteddevelopers lacking in the resources and know how required to protect their ideas in the face of Microsoft'sruthless *Embrace, Extend, Extinguish* crusade. 
Forgive yourself for a moment and return there with me. Or perhaps somewhere else, if you need ­wherever and whenever you last remember feeling genuinely enthralled with *The Future of Computers*.(Perhaps it was yesterday! If so, Gourd bless you. Never change.) Let's take ourselves back to kindergarten,before we knew anything about the rapid cyclical consolidation and monopolization within the technologyindustry that had already established itself as a trend, by then, when all we knew of the software weinteracted with was contained within our most visceral reactions: *I like Ask Jeeves because I like red and I like Jeeves.* I vaguely remember when Google (the search engine) first broached the general awareness ofmy elementary school's computer lab. I'm fairly sure I even remember the sort of feelings that were elicitedthe first time I actually set eyes on the Google.com homepage: it looked so modern, then, compared to therest of the web. (After two decades, it currently looks like shit.) Upon the first first query, it was immediatelyclear that Google was superior to any of the other search engines we'd been using. 
This sort of encounter - with a service that significantly alters one's perception of a given set of tasks - isprecious in our lives as users. 
A few examples from my own using life which come to mind: 
-The first time I witnessed a Skype call.
-Downloading and using the beta Evernote client on the school machines in Junior High. 
-The first album I uploaded on Bandcamp. 
-Discord's first public release.
-The "moment" I first put a name to Markdown. (I'd been using bits of the syntax for years before I actuallyread the word.)
-And most recently, exploring Notion as personal catch-all documentation software. 
The atmosphere of elation about the future on which I so often lament has been replaced by wariness formost of us - from Californian software developers to tractor-hacking farmers. Now, the conversation issaturated with CEO appearances before legal committees, corporate memo leaks, and somber interviews. Ofcourse, I have unquestionably contributed *more* than my share. In fact, I wish I could be twice as criticalin twice the written volume, and [I believe](https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/1329078973691695117) thetech media industry to be far too culturally-embedded within Silicon Valley to be nearly critical enough. Forthis holiday, though, I think a respite from the negative is worthwhile and essential. I know it is for *my*personal sanity, at least.

A week ago, I shared [this Google Form](https://bit.ly/softthank) and asked you to reflect with me on the"really great" software/services *you* have encountered in your using life built by "technology companieswho's business ethics align toward the benefit of us users and who's products are well-priced (or free!)" Asof the time of this writing, nearly 80 responses have been recorded on the form, itself, and several more via[comments on *Hacker News*](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25177582). I deeply appreciate yourparticipation! They're far from predictable, too - I've ended up learning a lot. The very first submission wasfor [Logos Bible Software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logos_Bible_Software), which has [quite afascinating history](https://blogs.bible.org/bible-software-history-101/). I feel like those less-secular of us gounexposed to theological software without participants such as the human who submitted this one (thankyou, human!,) and end up missing out on an entire segment of software development. Having studied TheGood Book in a very much analog fashion through Lutheran school, I wonder in retrospect how softwaresolutions could've changed the experience. 
I have never received this volume of feedback in my prompts before, nor have I ever really seen a reason toclose any of them to responses, so I'm going to take a blind shot at the dartboard and plan to close the formon **New Year's Day, 2021**. Until then, please feel free to respond in any way you'd like and/or view allthe live answers in this [**very bad spreadsheet**](https://bit.ly/thanksheet) full of these very *good*responses. (My apologies - I have absolutely no idea how to use Google Sheets.)

## 
I originally intended to go into relatively extensive detail for each of the entities on my own Most ThankfulFor list, but I do have to *actually stop somewhere*, so the commentary on these isn't remarkably insightfulor educational. It *is* genuine, though, which is worth something, I hope. 
### 1. [Bandcamp](https://bandcamp.com/) 
Yes, I have tirelessly promoted [my essay about Bandcamp's holiness](https://bilge.world/bandcamp­streaming-music) for years now, but I have done so with good reason: here is a for-profit technologycompany which is building a one-of-a-kind product that invests directly in independent artists. I spent awhole summer scouring The Web looking for *a single misstep* or controversy and found absolutely none. 
> Over the course of this super link-laden journey, we’d consider the alarmingly hypocritical possibility thatit’s been overlooked by mainstream conversations only because it has so long operated in the precisemanner we claim is so hopelessly absent from its neighbors in its deliberate, principled, and innovativejourney towards a transparent, progressive vision. 
### 2. [OBS](https://obsproject.com/) 
Before OBS (Open Broadcaster Software,) streaming video was an absolute mess that usually involvedpaying for or pirating some proprietary software. Remember Ustream? Good God...

OBS is the streaming video equivalent of Audacity and GIMP: an extremely powerful, infinitely-malleable setof tools that allow one to take full advantage of their hardware to capture and/or stream video and audio.

### 3. [Typora](https://typora.io/) 
There's a file entitled "[My Darling, Typora](https://github.com/extratone/bilge/blob/main/Drafts/My%20Darling%2C%20Typora.md)" sitting in my[essay drafts folder](https://github.com/extratone/bilge/tree/main/Drafts), currently, which describes thistext editor as "the perfect writing software." (See its [notes page on Notion](https://www.notion.so/rotund/My-Darling-Typora-b20ac14f9d7e4b20b9c823b0d8292c8f) for more.) 
From another recommendation I wrote: 
> Typora is an infinitely-customizable markdown editor spanning all platforms that's managed to become myprimary word processor (and I'm someone who demands *a lot* from word processors.) It's immenselypowerful in all the important ways - my use over the past two years has stress tested it with both enormous(100,000+ words) and extremely complicated (100+ images and embeds) documents. It's able to exporteven these chunkos to any format you can imagine instantaneously and never crashes. 
From a comment I made on [*The Information*'s notetaking software comparison](https://www.theinformation.com/articles/tech-execs-are-obsessing-over-note-taking-apps-we-tested-them­out): 
> Typora is a Markdown editor with left sidebar file sorting, very much like Bear (several available themescan make it look actually identical, in fact,) but without its native iCloud-based file syncing. It is cross-platform, open-source, and definitely more powerful, though. 
The Typora theming community has been especially on-point, as of late. In the screenshot embedded above,it's wearing the Slate variation of [H16nning's Gitbook theme](https://theme.typora.io/theme/Gitbook/),which is by far the most beautiful configuration I've yet to see the editor in. 
### 4. [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/) 
The GNU Image Manipulation Program - which just celebrated its [*25th* anniversary](https://www.gimp.org/news/2020/11/21/25-years-of-gimp/) last week - is one of the most powerful tools inits space and perhaps *the* number one exemplary example of open source software to cite whenexplaining the concept for the first time. I have used it my entire creative life for all manner of tasks andevangelized it plenty, but it wasn't until I [returned to college](https://www.davidblue.wtf/college-return/)this Fall and took advantage of Adobe's student discounts that I had an opportunity to thoroughly explore itsproprietary nemesis, Photoshop. 
<iframe width="auto" height="auto" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CezNvZ-TQlY?controls=0"frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in­picture" allowfullscreen></iframe> 
What I found was indeed a very powerful piece of software, albeit as arrogant as ever in its stubborncommitment to the original keyboard shortcuts set by default and other legacy artifacts, though not one Iwould compare to GIMP, necessarily. This shouldn't be breaking news: as far as I know, there are billions ofposts comparing the two going back to [the beginning of the written word](https://www.wired.com/1998/03/a-thrifty-photoshop-built-for-the-web/). My personal conclusion: **I canaccomplish much more, much faster with GIMP** in every single one of my own use cases. 
### 5. [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/) 
I was browsing some FOSS-related article aggregation page a few weeks ago when a post caught my eye: "[Audacity exceeds 100 million downloads](https://blog.fosshub.com/audacity-exceeds-100-million­downloads/)." In reflection, I realized in that moment that perhaps no other single piece of software hasbeen so thoroughly present in my "workflows" across all sorts of projects through the years, largely becauseof its God-sent [Truncate Silence feature](https://manual.audacityteam.org/man/truncate_silence.html),which I have used to remove silence from audio files for as long as I've been working within the medium, basically. Every podcast episode I have ever published has passed through Audacity for this reason andothers, as have voiceovers, high school punk band demo tapes, personal voice notes, and more. 
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">the world would actually beperfect if audacity&#39;s truncate silence feature could be autotied to video timecodes.</p>&mdash; DavidBlue (@NeoYokel) <a href="https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/766786796898357248?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 19, 2016</a></blockquote> <script asyncsrc="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script> 
Until OBS came along, Audacity was where all recorded audio started for myself and my creative friends. Itwas Audacity that captured (and caused, technically) the [death of my friend's soundcard in audio form](https://clyp.it/ycvt1wij) during the recording process for [*Hamura*](https://ihadtopee.bandcamp.com/album/hamura), the first Drywall album, back in October of 2011. 
<iframe width="100%" height="auto" src="https://clyp.it/ycvt1wij/widget" frameborder="0"></iframe> 
Fucking around in Audacity through the years has led to some halfway creative results on my part, including["SLOWED 'N' THROWED" Hilary Duff tracks](https://soundcloud.com/digivoid/hilary-duff-with-love-slowed­n-throwed) and [legacy Windows sounds remixes](https://soundcloud.com/chordoslut/windows-operatic). Istill use it for every episode of [*End User*](https://anchor.fm/davidblue) and have recently created a macrofor remastering [*Drycast*](https://anchor.fm/drycast) episodes. (A big feat for me and reflective ofAudacity's ingenuity.) As far as I know, there are *zero* competitors, proprietary or not, which can replicateAudacity's particular usefulness as an audio utility.

![NeoCities Interactions](https://i.snap.as/10geW13j.png) 
### 6. [NeoCities](https://neocities.org/) 
Shortly after I discovered NeoCities last Spring, I signed up to be a [Supporter](https://neocities.org/supporter) for $5/month, not necessarily for the additional storage or bandwidth, butbecause the project immediately sounded like one I was personally obligated to uplift. Parimal Satyal's essay"[Rediscovering the Small Web](https://neustadt.fr/essays/the-small-web/)," along with the design of thewebsite which delivered it, inspired me to make another attempt at building an HTML site by hand. So far,[davidblue.xyz](https://davidblue.xyz/) obviously borrows *heavily* from his CSS, but looking at the codeitself was vastly more pleasant than one would expect. Recently, during the course of writing an [academicresearch essay](https://github.com/extratone/bigblue), I found myself listening to [interviews with itsfounder, Kyle Drake](https://www.softwaresessions.com/episodes/bringing-geocities-back-with-kyle-drake/)and reading [articles from its debut in 2013](https://www.wired.com/2013/07/neocities/), which promptedme to take even further advantage of my account. 
![The Drywall Website](https://i.snap.as/UhS9a89b.png) 
Last week, I moved my inactive automotive blog ([dieselgoth.com](https://dieselgoth.com)) from a Writeasblog to a purely-HTML [NeoCities website](https://neocities.org/site/dieselgoth) with disturbingly littlefriction. (I challenge you to spot any differences.) After discovering a backup of the original Drywall Websitedeep within my old files, NeoCities was the only reasonable host on which to [archive it](https://iowa.neocities.org/). After I'd finished uploading, I fell down what the youth call a "rabbit hole" ofdiscovery, mesmerized by what I found on page after page of [NeoCities' site browser](https://neocities.org/browse). I did my best to save the best finds by [following them](https://neocities.org/site/davidblue/follows) within the sites dashboard and have since set up a [*Best ofNeoCities* GitHub repository](https://github.com/extratone/neocollect) with my absolute favorites amongthem archived thanks to [wget](https://www.gnu.org/software/wget/). 
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">LOOK AT THIS GORGEOUSWEBSITE! <a href="https://t.co/nahoRCEkeE">https://t.co/nahoRCEkeE</a> <ahref="https://t.co/mzEfhGygWz">pic.twitter.com/mzEfhGygWz</a></p>&mdash; David Blue (@NeoYokel)<a href="https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/1328337497416458247?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November16, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script> 
Trust me when I tell you that **some of the best web design, *ever* can be found on NeoCities**. What'seven better: after my deep dive, I was pleasantly surprised by strangers [commenting on what I'd found](https://neocities.org/site/davidblue?event_id=1301289)! Replying in a timely, substantial, and genuinemanner seems to be a hallmark of the community: my (rather verbose) question regarding the well­manneredness of publishing such an archive without permission in [the community Discord](https://discord.gg/pF7wHrf9tb) I discovered just this morning was almost immediately met withencouraging replies. 
A Post you should probably expect soon: "NeoCities is 2020's Best Social Network." Going forward, I'd like to[digitize my poetry collection on NeoCities](https://neocities.org/site/feebles) in the near future whilecontinuing to otherwise brush back up on HTML and CSS - both of which I am *also* very thankful for, cometo think of it. 
Thank you again for your correspondence! May your Imperialism Day be a positive experience!

# Excerpt: Blimp's Burden, Chapter VI 
![Blood - Blimp's Burden Chapter VI](https://i.snap.as/BEgMZAo.jpg) 
## Two young men steal a wheel of cheese. 
*This is an excerpt from my novel project, Blimp's Burden, about a jaded software engineer who’s new,ridiculously-eccentric boss presents a future which forces him to reckon with his mishandled grief. To supportthe novel's creation with art, funds, etc, please [email me](mailto:davidblue@extratone.com).* 
In the right hour, the woodland springtime metamorphic processes of the neighboring Lake Geneva suburb’sin-betweens were in a paused state – the toads again hushed; the crickets tired, and the human populace,too. In the right hour, the fickle wind and the social owls were the only sound, and nothing moved but thesparse, light-footed doe in careful segments with her fawn. From the main gated lane of *The Nice, HugeEstate*, Lenny Lather slid through the muddy barrier and started bouncing West on the blacktop, broguessqueaking every third step. The overcasted clouds were having trouble deciding whether or not to let downtheir rain – as they had been all day – and the old, heavy early-March mist softened the yellow glow of thetall, buzzing streetlamps so much that he couldn’t help but intermittently wipe his eyes, for the spreadinglight convinced his mind that his eyelashes must’ve been wetted. 
Theodore Pith’s big old house was now burrowed between two mismatched neighborhoods – the bleakerEasterly, which was too new for its alien trees to have recovered from the brutality of its development’sclear-cutting and contained within one of its central featureless backyards an unidentifiable creature whichmade all through the night the most unimaginably ghastly, disturbingly human child-like shrieking; theopposing Westerly’s trees further enough along in their regrowth – ten or twenty years perhaps – to appearmore of the planet Earth to Manhattan-bred Lenny Lather, who still found the colorless destruction ofsuburbia unendingly upsetting, especially when coming down. In the interest of his regular withdrawal’smitigation, he had already established two short, repeatable tracks and a longer, several mile-long loopwhich skirted him sufficiently around the East’s center to avoid hearing the shrieks in all but the stillestnights. Never in his years – on these walks he was *especially* reminded of just how many there were – hadhe been able to feel such absolute ownership of his surroundings. The eroding Earth slipping away from thehem of the warped, stained wood fences; the sidewalks, cracked, bent, sloped helter-skelter, often muddiedin the troughs and joints – generally laying haphazardly in layers after having been steadily tossed about bythe glacial forces of their intermixture with clay, precipitation, and the tumultuous temperature-dependenttorture of the two – these were his, entirely, in the right hour. Between two and five in the morning whenthe earliest risers would blearily revive their dewy automobiles from long, silent hibernation, the whole world
– everything in his sight and more at any moment – it was all *his*, without a single worthy challenger. 
In the right hour, the roads were completely and totally abandoned – for the New Yorker, an unfathomableabsolute – and all humanity was at rest. In the right hour, Lenny Lather was the appointed guardian of theworn domesticity of a small nation, though the lonely occupation was astoundingly lax, for in the miles andmiles of empty streets he had already traversed in his nightly holidays from the World of Pith, he had yet toencounter a single unexpected factor or minutely threatening presence. Since shortly after his Decemberarrival, he’d walked through even the most frigid mornings. Of course, the stillness had then been *evenmore* otherworldly, and Lenny was curious to see how his new most private domain would change with theseasons. Though the auxiliary guest room which he now called home was no smaller or less hospitable thanthe master bedroom of his late Hudson Yards flat shared with his late Wife, it proved to be a poor respitefrom Theodore Pith, who treated him – when they were “home” at *Nice, Huge* – as the puppy he neverhad, and expected his participation to remain entirely vulnerable to his any whim. Granted – in their sharedabuse of amphetamines, cocaine, and assorted other stimulants – Lenny Lather was vastly more preparedfor the games than any circadian guest could’ve possibly been. At first, the ten-foot door of his dawn-facingroom had closed without latching, but with the warmth and moisture brought with the Midwestern Spring,the most secure state in which the engorged wood could be forcibly arranged still left a half-inch crack, andLather’s last chance of privacy was lost. 
The latest favorite pastime of *Nice, Big*’s Master necessitated a willing, capable driver, and – as keeping a single Butler (much less an entire household staff) was proving extremely difficult for him – Lenny Latherwas the sole pick of the draft. In the earliest hours of one Tuesday morning in February, he’d beenpleasantly dosing and drooling on his laptop after an evening of obsessive, incoherent notetaking when thehuge door had been kicked ajar by a deep black, blindingly shiny oxford with excessively violent force.Attached to the shoe in an equally blinding penguin tuxedo, towering bowler hat, and cartoonish fakemustache was the Great, Blown Pith. 
“Hope you’re not busy,” he’d said quite loudly to the lolling Lather, leaning and tilting his head into the lamplight, which had dislodged his monocle and briefly occupied him with untangling its chain. 
… 
“You’re not *busy*, are ya?!” he’d shouted, tapping the shiny brass lion’s head of his shiny black caneagainst the vanity… then swatting it with a flicking wrist… then clubbing it with a full, two-handed homerunswing – taking huge, vaguely cat nose-shaped gouges from the surface of the wood. The splintery woodchips had rained down upon the hunched Lenny; he’d stirred with one found its way in his open mouth –he’d chewed it slowly and swallowed it, but he still had not awoken. Nevertheless, Theodore Pith’s coked-upenthusiasm couldn’t possibly have yielded to common decencies like his guest’s nighttime peace. 
… 
“SHOOT, LENNY,” he’d screamed in his companion’s ear, having traversed the room to his bedside. 
“I SURE HOPE YOU’RE NOT BUSY RIGHT NOW!” 
… 
Finally, he’d resorted to tickling Lenny’s nose with the ornament, which had reeked with the urinal smell ofmetal polish – the sudden, overwhelming delivery of which to the writer’s olfactory nerves finally causingample alarm in his nervous system to justify bringing him abruptly back to his life and deluded host. 
“I need a favor. The Duesie’s warming up. We’re going for a ride.” 
Unable to form a linguistic response, Lenny Lather had obeyed Theo’s frenzied, repeating instructions andstumbled into the matching suit he’d brought over his arm – wondering with marginal, arrested clarity athow well-tailored it was for him. He had not the soundness of perception to protest when Pith had whippeda deep black, blindingly shiny bowtie around his already-congested esophagus, nor when he’d adheased thehuge, itchy matching fake moustache to his upper lip and nearly pulled the matching Tower of Bowler all theway down over his ears. He had been unresponsive when he’d been sat on the bench under the agonizingfluorescent lights of the laundry room, affixed with deep black, blindingly shiny matching oxfords, and askedif he smoked and how well he could say *guffaw.* 
… 
“Just wait… you have no idea… you have no idea how much fun this is going to be.” 
Lenny Lather had not… *could not* have made a sound through the confusing nonsense of his waking pre-Great Depression dream, but when the old servant’s door had been opened before him and set the heartless,single-digit Winter wind upon his very soul, he had all at once arrived in the world, laughing and whoopingtogether with Theodore Pith. 
“Jesus *Christ!*” he’d screamed as they’d hobbled to the stable, where a devilishly dark red Model JDuesenberg had sat shivering in a rough idle, staring out the retrofitted garage door with its basketball-sizedlights as if it was, indeed, a flesh-and-blood steed that had just been frightened awake by a thunderstorm,but the sky had been as clear as it would’ve been from an asteroid – as it is only on the coldest nights – andalmost comically dominated by the setting, gluttonously luminescent moon. Theodore had then grabbed ascrewdriver from the workbench and bent down to remove the license plate – which had said *BLOOD* in big black bold block letters – and its containing frame. By the time he had settled into the frigid red leatherof the exposed, roofless driver’s seat, Lenny Lather was full-to-bursting with adrenaline and laughing outhuge streams of breathy steam. From behind him in the cabin, Pith had been *guffawing* plumes, too, ashe’d briefly ignited his cocaine-sprinkled mustache instead of the bratwurst-sized cigar between his teeth.The smell of burning human hair had accented his explanation of the old car’s transmission and its directpath from source-to-nose for Pith had required a brief, unplanned intermission as it induced without warninghis violent heaving – still part-*guffawing* – hanging half out of his beautifully-upholstered suicide door. 
As he had spewed – expertly sparing the swoop of the gleaming waxy fender – Lenny had found a pair ofdeep black, blindingly shiny gloves and – after less grinding than you would imagine, to his credit – firstgear, setting the whole dastardly circus in motion. 
“Where to, Sire?” Lenny had asked, nose lifted to an untenable altitude in a pitiful approximation of anaccent that’d never actually been used before by any person or persons in all of history, struggling forbreath. 
“Left at the gates, Barnsward, old chap,” Theodore had replied in a contrasting fashion after again sittingupright from his heaves and taking a breath, ironing out – if anything – the flatness of his perforating OhioDs and Ps, resulting in such a culturally destructive racket that it had set both of them in uncontrollable,cloudy fits lasting long after Lather had swerved the great length of the car from the gravel to his abandonedasphalt retreat. The two had continued their banter down that soul-suckingly flat vector, one-upping eachother’s etymologic barbarity against the savage thievery of the heatless wind. 
“Now to star-board, Budleigh, my good fellow!” 
… 
“Right-o, as you say, sir!” 
… 
“Down to the *pu-hb* for a *spaht* of *brahn*-dee with me *mae-its*!” 
… 
“*Oncemo-ar* right, pip pip!” 
… 
“By *jah-lee*, there we are!” 
… 
After the entirety of Northern European history had been decimated and subsequently forgotten, theDuesenberg named *BLOOD* had turned its orange, googley-eyed stare and narrow whitewalled hooves upthe reflective, freshly-painted access of the new 24-hour grocery in the no-man’s-land between the cookie-cutter stares of the neatly-rowed Easterly neighborhood and the droning respiration of Interstate 43, twomiles distant. It was 2:12 in the morning and most of the greasy-haired night stocking shift had beenhalfway through their third smoke break, circled around a store-used picnic table 50 yards from the farsliding airlock doors. The first to spot *BLOOD* had been the second shortest of the lot, whose wearyscrutiny along the truest radian to the West from under his sweaty beanie in her entrance she had crossed,and the depth of her red as he first spied it had caused him vertigo – as if he would fall in – and cast uponthe shorter-than-average length of his being an all-consuming existential doubt. The tallest and loudest ofthem had faced squarest the white faux-brick wall of the box building and was at that moment engagedupon a spirited rant about where and where’nt and when a vapist ought to buy his Suck juice between long,gasping Sucks from his super-shiny Suck box. Of course, the arrival of a customer even at such a late hourdid not warrant notice at a huge, broadly-servicing operation like theirs, but as *BLOOD* had crept through all four reflective yellow-checkered pedestrian crossings, closing without a flinch, and the details of heroccupying caricatures had become more and more numerous, she had stolen the attention of the huddle,one-by-one, and elicited from each the rarest under-breath profanity of true, unmolested wonder. 
“*Jesus Christ*,” had said the shortest. 
“*Holy fuck,*” had said the youngest. 
“*Gee whiz*,” had said the oldest. 
And the Sucking tallest, having realized he’d lost his audience, had been the last to turn and follow their eyes*BLOOD*’s way as she had halted coolly in front of the purely white glowing concrete leading into theclosest customer entrance, and had – without the gradual exposure over the length of her approach that hispeers had been afforded – dropped his Suck box and exclaimed at the sudden, undiluted immensity of thespectacle, simply, “*FUCK!*” 
The Sucking’s *FUCK* and the splitting shatter of his Suck against the glass of their smoking table hadreached the two arrivees – albeit in a muted way – and through the onset of their frostbite’s early stageseven further stoked their already-uncontrollable boyish giggling. Theodore Pith had paused briefly to affix hismonocle as firmly as possible in his eye socket and stuff down his spasmic *guffaws* with a few lip-smacking puffs of his then successfully-lit cigar before swinging his right door open. 
“Stay here and wait at the ready, my good… my *best* Bagsy! I shan’t be a twinkle,” he had declared,clicking it lightly shut again and turning on his heels toward the pale light of the store, twirling his cane indramatically shortened strides so as to reproduce the oversped effect of a silent motion picture, puff-puffingaway. As the doors had sensed him and indiscriminately whirred aside, he had turned to the smokers – mostof whom had still been reeling, grabbing for their hair – and bobbed the bulk of his big black bowler towardtheir communion with his gloved black fingers by the brim. 
“Tally-*ho*, my boys!” he had shouted, sending Lenny Lather’s wide open face toward the floor of the idlingcar as he doubled over himself in the first spontaneously asphyxiating, tear-lobbing laughter he’d yet toexperience in the 21st century. As Theodore had entered the masterpiece of the boxed store’s bleakness inhis cane twirling, head swinging, cigar puffing shuffle, he had made sure to stay his instinct to *sneak* for aswift, full-chat *dart*, instead, and the on-duty leather-faced embodiment of tedium’s wrath beneath hislone lit lane light had looked up from his *People* Magazine just in time to see the heel of a deeply blackoxford and the last shiny inches of flowing black coattails disappear behind the potato sack endcap of the farAisle 1. He’d hesitated, chin against palm, holding his next glossed page perpendicularly erect between histightened thumb and index finger for a long few seconds of fantastic stillness – had hastily attempted adiagnostic of his present senses – before a locomotive-like segmented tube of cigar smoke had risen fromagainst the light tiles and unsoiled trimming to intersect his line-of-sight where it met the darkened deli,recessed in the far wall from his hunch, the motion startling him into his own throat-clearing, counter-rounding, key-jingling, *excuse me*-shouting march toward the lumpy potato sacks and the climbingdissipation of the most unbelievable violation. As he had jingled, he had reflected on the few occasions inwhich he’d ever smelled tobacco smoke in *his* store: all incidental, most very brief, and many followed bya lengthy, unreasonably self-deprecating apology. To just walk in his Temple of Domestic Fulfilment duringthis most Serene Time of Silent Service, spewing orange nicotine on his premium, Food & DrugAdministration-blessed body and blood offering to the middle class was surely in ignorance, but could haveeven been *in spite*. Regardless, the transgression was worthy of the most merciless wrath, and he hadbeen selected as its willing, capable vessel. In just the fifteen seconds it’d taken him to jingle his way to Aisle1, he’d thought himself and his leather into flash-broiling, fast-rising fury. 
Perhaps the least expected sight that could have possibly greeted this Apostle of Appraisal on the far side ofAisle 1 – as he rounded the potato sack endcap and filled his *excuse me* lungs in preparation through hisnose – was the labored lifting of the 125-pound eldest child of the new, Parisian-trained, full-time, certifiedcheese artisan – whom the store had just won out of 175 competitors in a region-wide raffle of her pilotprogram – by the dashing, swinging, and smoking real-life manifestation of a young Rich Uncle Pennybags,yet shock did not long halt the Keys & Leather. 
“Sir! Excuse me!” 
… 
“*Excuse me!* Sir!” 
… 
Theodore Pith – having reevaluated the girth of his intended booty – had propped his shiny black caneagainst the sill of the refrigerator and popped each slack bottom up off his oxfords from his shins beforesquatting over the massive Holy Wheel of the Artisan where it lay displayed on a sturdy bespoke plinth. 
… 
“Sir! You need to put out that cigar… the cigar – put it out immediately!” 
Keys & Leather had the odd inability to both shout and shuffle at the same time, so he’d only made it to thepomegranate juice by the time Pith had mustered enough momentum to swing the cheese child into a highenough pendulum to carry it stably facing forward under his chin with his two hands spaced evenly on theGreat Wheel’s bottom. 
… 
“Sir! I’m going to have to ask you to put that down… That is a four thousand dollar item… If you want tobuy it, we need to go about-” 
“…now, see here!” Pith had replied with great effort, in the midst of weighing in his mind the worth of thecane as a casualty, then of the monocle, too, which had fallen out while he was weighing, and of his ownphysical intelligence, and whether or not it was capable of retrieving the cane by its brass lion’s head handlevia the top of a flicking foot without losing his balance. Keys & Leather, meanwhile, had been tortured atgreat length witnessing – in Theodore’s gravitational struggle – the Cuban’s ashes knocked all over theprecious round Immanuel; the artisan’s Beloved, Chosen son of cheese – a nauseating sensation of lossoverwhelming all hope of his store’s defense. The Terrible Theodore had at once noticed his hesitation *and*arrived upon a plan to leave no prop behind. He had leaned forward with the girth of the wheel and closedthe remaining few feet between them, advancing with the huge mass of Nazarethian dairy to bear it all downupon the unsuspecting Leather, who in his grief for the prized wheel was far too slow to deflect its incoming mass. 
“Now, see here, chum!” Pith had forced from the furthest possible extremis of his best mob mouth as hetransferred his burden all at once to its most concerned party, who collapsed against the multilayered tablesthat made up the fresh cookie display, with the weight of the wheel on his belly. As the stunned Leatherstruggled to separate himself without further soiling the only item in his store that sold for double a month’spaycheck, Theodore had replaced his monocle and returned for his cane in a single stride, which he’d thenused after a return step to the pile of chocolate chip, almond nut, and fuming night manager to rap loosewith the snout of the terrible brass cat Leather’s white knuckle-tight grip on the wheel with a lampoonish*haha!* before rolling the freed cheese toward the door in a villainous cackle. 
“Man, *come on*,” the defeated Leather had yelled halfheartedly from his pile of sweets, struggling againstthe awkward, slippery boxes for enough footing to stand. His efforts, though, were interrupted after a timeby the abrupt mute of Pith’s cackling in the second swooshing of the front sliding doors – he had missed hislast chance of pursuit. It had all been in vain – he’d failed to guard the crown jewel of the whole suburb. Ashe had given up the chase and the cheese and slumped once more against the ruined pile, theridiculousness of the crime against him nearly cracked a smile, but soon was deterred by the very realthought of explaining what had happened to his General Manager when she arrived in just five hours. After amoment, there, covered in cookies, dust, ashes, and shame, he had quietly begun to sob. 
After he had regained control of his diaphragm, Lenny Lather had been amused, outside, by the varyingvelocities in which the smokers of the night shift gave in to their curiosities about the presence of the seven-figure collectible and its purpose in waiting at its now healthier idle in front of their grocery store in theloneliest time of a Tuesday morning. The first and the bravest had been the one who first spotted theirintrusion – the shortest – if only because he had remained entirely convinced for the duration that *BLOOD*and its two, period-dressed occupants were nothing but an apparition of his dead Grandfather and GreatUncle like others he’d thought he’d seen before, and – though he’d been terrified by the clarity of this realestvisit yet, he’d been irritated more than anything, and wanted to know “why the hell can’t you just leave me*alone*?!” The others behind him had been staggered in the proximity to the waiting car they had achieved
– the lesser and most cowardly being the largest – the Sucking evangelist – who had been waiting for thegreat automobile to leave so he could forge the exchange of his broken Suck box for a new one from theback. In the delirium of his exhaustion and progressing frostbite, Lenny Lather had thought the image of themen where they were would make for an interesting, organic graph on the nature of courage – theirpositions simply representing their unaltered datapoints, and had been considering how best to deal with orrespond to the nearer, deluded one, who had by then come close enough to the elegant, professionallypolished front-right fender to reach out and touch it with his unwashed hands, and appeared to be takingthe matter under serious consideration. He’d been seconds away from finally deciding between his idioticideas for a joke response when by far the largest wheel of cheese he’d ever seen had come rolling out of theopening doors onto the concrete, followed closely behind by Theodore Pith who’d still had three-quarters ormore of his cigar left to smoke and apparently switched to cheap mob clichés in his brief absence. 
“Haste, Don Lenny!” he’d yelled, re-opening his closest cabin door to chuck his cane in first. He’d thenstraddled the great wheel to position it against the step before making a scene of grunting and huffingagainst its side with his full weight. Again, the bewildered smokers had fallen silent – they did not recognizethe ridiculous delicacy because it was special inventory and could only be handled by the Holy Artisanherself. Lather had started revving the huge old straight-8 to answer Pith’s urgency, who had found himselffresh out of phrases after the wheel had finally succumbed to its capture and rolled into the footwell. 
“Make haste, make haste, my boy!” he’d shouted, diving theatrically into the covered back seat, head-first,to which his icing chauffer had responded by revving the behemoth and briskly popping her clutch, whichhad lurched the pair into the last, getaway stage of their late grocery heist. As *BLOOD*’s razor-edged hoodornament had sliced through the night by the dumbstruck smokers, Theodore Pith was unable to think ofanything to shout at them as he passed but for “bada-bing, bada-*BOOM!*” 
Though the Lake Geneva Police Department was shown the security footage of that first theft bymanagement, the theatricality of their matching getup had inadvertently obscured their identities, and theorganization’s extreme deficit of imagination had left them stumped by the lack of license plates on the car,despite the free and effortless ability of just about any casual enthusiast of early American luxuryautomobiles and/or lackadaisical disciple of the Concours religion to immediately identify *BLOOD* by*name* from the grainiest image, if consulted. If anything, their incompetence rewarded Pith and Lather’scontinued focus on the products of the same store’s cheese artisan, as intelligence on the state of her latestflagship incubation was freely available with no more effort than it took to simply stop by her display amidregular shopping trips. Twice in two weeks, they stole both of her replacements for the biggest child withoutany significant alternation of their method, which frustrated her and the management nearly to the point ofcrises, and quickly lost all potential for fun in a third attempt – their kicks were in their absurdity, not their*effectiveness*, and neither of them cared much for the cheese.

# Kilgore Trout on CreateSpace 
In the midst of arranging [*Feebles*](http://bit.ly/Feebles) for print, I stumbled upon an author and “bookdesigner” engaged in launching a community for self-published, independent writers. I'm not going to specifynames because I have no interest in shitting on his company, nor “what it stands for.” I don't want to shitfor you at all, actually, just note a few still-underrealized realities about the sheer ludicrousness of the wordbusiness as it stands. Let's say you've got some manuscripts you've been sitting on for a few years, andyou're introduced to the concept of self-publishing by an evermore earnestly-curious man on the radionamed Audie one day. He and his interviewee (the owner of a self-publishing service) seem to say, curiously,that because an author's profit-per-unit can potentially be “four to five times more” than if he/she ispublished traditionally, self-publishing has now shed completely its aura of desperate amateurism. 
But - whoa, Nelly - writing to sell books, and writing books have perhaps never been further apart. And gee ­you certainly didn't write to sell; selling hadn't occurred to you at all for a very long time, but from just onesearch, you find Our Friend, back from his own experiences as an author and editor, qualified and insistentthat you *can* make money selling creative works of fiction. 
And Jesus Christ… All that said, I must admit to you that I've just finished Kurt Vonnegut's *Breakfast ofChampions*, and was unable to commence this “review” without wondering aloud for you how Kilgore Trout
-perhaps Kurt's favorite creation - would feel about this Friend's business. 
It was actually my Aunt Ayn who taught me to write, so Vonegutt was a mediocre Ray William Johnson-associated [YouTube band](https://youtu.be/zAtBEhKU7uw) until after high school, when "lots of people"started telling me to "read Vonnegut, man," even though I cannot recall any specific events orrecommenders. For whatever reason, though, I'd bought a copy immediately after a friend mentioned it,recently, and found him (in this particular work, at least) to be awfully sane for my taste, yet particularlyresonant. Though written to make me think it was all a big one-draft ramble, Kurt's a bit too curt for it to bebelieved, I think. Auntie Rand would've double-taken his beratement of "in nonsense is strength" if she'dmade it that far. I hope she did, because I found the image of her taking in his occasional hand doodles tobe very amusing. 
Dwayne Hoover is awfully absent - and therefore, a very versatile storytelling device, though not in a lazysense. We're repeatedly notified about an imminent convergence. Eventually, it's explained that theendgame involves Dwayne exploding into a violent revengeful tantrum against all the lifelong enemies of hissubconscious. Including "people with brown skin." Can I just bring up Ayn Rand again? I hope it's okay. 
Kilgore Trout is the most dangerous villain I've ever experienced. He has little to lose, and - like Vonnegut, itwould seem - finds his observatory position in the world to be immensely amusing. His last amusement,even. Remember Ellsworth M. Toohey, the corrupter? I think they would've gotten along, funny enough. 
Yes, and Hoover would be Peter Keating, the corrupted. I'm reaching, yeah, but when do I not? Theirimmediate difference is the lack of malicious intent in Trout, of course. He is an aimless science fictionwriter, who gives Dwayne a volume simply to shut him up. Neither villain is believable, per se, but both werewritten to be personifications of ideals; vehicles of metaphor. 
I think Rand could've quite easily become Vonnegut, were she to stick around much longer, but perhaps Ibelieve so only because I've experienced a quantifiable transition from her sort of thinking (vaguely) to his(perhaps less vaguely.) An incorruptible commitment to *absolute* was Ayn's most potent conviction.Growing up as a white cis male, I was aching for a method of simplifying the world which I knew more andmore to be infinitely complex. Inevitably, with age, I think a limitless appetite for the complexity must form,lest one spend the rest of his/her life fighting the singular truth in a miserable fortress of seclusion andamphetamine abuse. 
The key to *Breakfast of Champions*' genius is its utter lack of angst. Aside from his brief definition of abeing - "an unwavering band of light" - Kurt had little interest in writing a manifesto, yet his perspective inhis curious commentary manifests a much more profound critique of American society than Rand ever could've from her hole. 
As such, I think it's wisest to leave a rudimentary whole measurement of a writer to Aunt Ayn, but perhaps aparticularly relevant spectrum in this case is clarity of sight. Rigid idealism has its place in literature, nodoubt, but it's an awfully boring one without a writer's feet on the ground. 
How does this all relate to self-publication? Well, Our Friend, it turns out, offers preset novel "templates" tomembers of his writing community, into which one can "plug in" characters, setting, and basic plot elementsto a degree of his/her choosing. And his YouTube channel is stuffed with all sorts of tutorials on formattingand - more disturbingly - how to create sellable cover art with Photoshop. Naturally, it includes instruction onstock and rights-free images. 
Though I've yet to read one, it doesn't take much imagination to comprehend the inevitable product. FromOur Friend's vlogs, I can suppose a heavy focus on the adolescent market. What makes the whole conceptnoteworthy in my mind is the *why?* I'd like to think that I have a fairly-realistic grasp on the potentialitiesof writing for profit, and am obligated to wonder why one would "compromise" his/her "creative integrity" bypublishing *literature* to sell, of all things. 
As I understand it, the methodical approach to authorship being encouraged is applicable to literally *any*other field, creative or not. It's curious and impressive, frankly, as their sales potential seems to be vastlysuperior to anything I'll ever bother to publish, but I must weigh in because of one quantifiable detriment:saturation. 
Someone is spending their money on these works - probably for their kids. I'm not a parent, but I'd betremendously ashamed to discover that a book I'd given as a gift to *anyone* had been manufactured inthis manner. Not just in the sense that most light literature is *manufactured* - written in hearty observanceof academic rules of storytelling - but *literally* mass-produced with a goddamned intellectual stencil. 
Without sounding like I'm complaining... My singular self-published poetry collection is probably ofsignificantly less whole-value to the majority of readers, but I can't help but think the effort put into its hand-drawn cover art and meticulously-arranged typography would make it a more *comfortable* investment, ifanything else. 
This brings us to a distinctly-academic mainstay which I have always taken issue with: "consider youraudience." I first encountered this proverb in the context of a composition studies course, mind you, whereits consideration in the essay medium makes unequivocally good sense. If we agree that an essay is definedby an uncompromising commitment to its effectiveness in making an argument, audience awareness isessential. If you were asked to decide on one primary purpose of writing in general, though, would it not beidentical? 
Why didn't Kurt Vonnegut or Ayn Rand simply write essays? Well, the latter wrote many, but their sales havealways been all but invisible compared to *The Fountainhead* and *Atlas Shrugged.* (Both of whichresemble essays more than fiction, at times, but I'll spare you that conversation.) Did they consider theiraudience? Certainly not in the way [my first Google result](http://writingcommons.org/open-text/writing­processes/think-rhetorically/712-consider-your-audience) articulates it: 
> Ensure that your documents meet the needs and expectations of your readers." 
Ooo boy. To me, that translates a little too easily into "write what your readers want to read." And maaaan...If there's anything that experience and Donald Draper have taught me, it's that people have no idea whatthey want, especially from art. And that's a reasonable mentality, isn't it? Perhaps even an exhaltable one. Iknow that predictable stories are my number one turnoff, personally. If I expected to exist for an eternity,I'd absolutely indulge every single creative work I could find, but I do not, and that realization (as I stated inmy last *Freq Check*,) has propelled an underlying preference in all of my consumption decisions: what Ihave not (before) seen. 
Obviously, then - if you take my word for it - Our Friend's endeavors are in direct ideological opposition to my own, which would make him my arch nemesis, if 21st-century industry were a bit more theatrical. But ­like most heroic protagonists - I'd be much more interested in "turning" him than censoring him, were weever to engage. In fact, I'd probably end up defending his and/or his constituents' right to sell their trash ifCreateSpace or other self-publishing services called it into question. 
Overwhelming content volume can be entertaining; Drywall was my own foray into that uniquelycontemporary experiment. It's the sheer ease of publication, though, that makes "good" literature moreprecious than ever. Admittedly, a glance at Amazon's current top ten bestsellers list indicates that I amundoubtedly out of touch as far as the market is concerned. I know that my mother and sisters havemysteriously reverted back to print from the Kindles which they used for a few years, and that audiobooksmake me supremely uncomfortable. I also know that reading a book - whenever I bring myself to shut outeverything else - is an unrivaled vehicle of cognitive serenity. 
A significant mission for *Extratone* lies in an upcoming reactionary movement to culture's "circus stage"(by way of the Internet.) We determined the event's inevitability on *Drycast*, a year ago, and have madeoccasional efforts to posit more thoroughly on *The New*. It must involve a reduction in contentconsumption, fundamentally, which will constrict because of an increasing demand for more explicit purposein all media. We are not to be the alternative, necessarily, but the intermediary arbiter of the enablingdiscussion, hopefully with the outcome of increased awareness. What is and is not relevant? *Why am Iconsuming this?* 
As the end of *Breakfast of Champions* draws abruptly closer, Vonnegut mentions his schizophrenia, whichis - as you probably know - fundamentally characterized by loss of the ability to determine what is and is notreal, and primarily treated with antipsychotics. Interestingly enough, extremely high doses of amphetamines(which Ayn Rand *did* use heavily, by the way. I wasn't making that up) can actually *induce* psychosis,which could crudely be described as *cognitive noise*. I could've missed the intended function of theirworks, but for me, they illuminate a distinct relationship between the abstracts of *truth* and *relevance*which, for the moment, seems particularly necessary. 
Two opposing reflections of Americana; both helpful in preparation for its future. 
May we never lose ourselves in the noise.

# The Case for Chuck Klosterman 
![Chuck Klosterman](https://i.snap.as/86yvtbj.png) 
## The genius of one Chuck continues to perform to the refreshing benefit of scholars in American culture. 
Thanks to [an episode of Peter Kafka's](https://www.recode.net/2017/8/22/16184520/transcript-writer­chuck-klosterman-music-sports-recode-media) [*Recode Media*](https://www.recode.net/2017/8/22/16184520/transcript-writer-chuck-klosterman-music-sports-recode­media), I've just now discovered that former *New York Times Magazine* Ethicist, author of *Sex, Drugs,and Cocoa Puffs*, and longtime men's interest media-affiliated sports and music columnist Chuck Klostermanpronounces his surname *kloa-ster-men* instead of *klaw-ster-men* as *I* have been, shamefully – evenwithin earshot of other human beings on a handful of occasions. I am willing to submit myself forpunishment for these transgressions under the single condition that I be allowed to call him *CuckKlusterfuck* the next time he ends a spoken sentence with "or whatever" in an interview – an unfortunatehabit he's [maintained for years](https://youtu.be/NMzPX-MERbU). If my own byline had any pedigree in theworld of literary criticism, I would now collect his penance simply by including those hateful, 90s stoner-kidbuzzwords in every quote, unedited, but it most certainly does not. I've searched moderately hard for anyreason to bother contributing any criticism of books or their authors and returned with very little. I've read*The Broom of the System* and *White Girls* this year, yes, but I'd have to be a [Fuck Boy](http://www.revelist.com/books/books-fuckboys-read/3289) to write anything about David Foster Wallace,and [Hilton Als’ elegant, genre-busting masterpiece](https://www.interviewmagazine.com/culture/hilton-als­white-girls) is so far beyond both my societal rights and perceptive capacity that I wouldn't dare utter asingle editorialized peep about it – aside from a log line-length recommendation – even under immediatethreat of certain death. 
Given my recent [voluntary relocation to Portland, Oregon](https://www.instagram.com/p/BhArAZNF6W7/)and the word-y pursuits on which I choose to spend all of my money and energy, I should adore everythingabout Chuck Klosterman and in turn he should be completely invisible across the under-30 demographic, yetI’ve found a special originality in his voice since first exploring it and I think it might be worth requalification.A good friend of mine once dug his [first novel](https://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/04/books/review/Meehan-t.html) [*Downtown Owl*](https://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/04/books/review/Meehan-t.html) out of a bulk box of bargain booksshe’d bought as a preteen, long ago and became an enthusiastic fan of his perspective and a harsh, but fondcritic of his persona. It was her copy of his second that I read first: [*The Visible Man*](https://www.npr.org/2011/10/04/141015210/visible-man-asks-what-if-no-one-were-watching) – ultimatelya surprisingly-original take on the *psychologist of a gifted outcast* tale that classically exemplifies the easy-to-digest yet thoughtfully-exploratory reputation of his craft. Thanks to her library card, I was able to followit up immediately with Chuck’s latest, most topical work – an anthology of past essays written forpublications like *The Guardian*, *Grantland*, and *GQ* entitled *X: A Highly Specific, Defiantly IncompleteHistory of the Early 21st Century*, which proved an impossibly entertaining, even more polished execution ofThe Quaint Chuck’s Explanations in non-fiction form, beginning at onset with refreshing brevity in its[introduction](http://bit.ly/ckintro). 
> I’m not fully accredited by either side of the professional equation (sportswriters think I’m too pretentiousand music writers don’t think I’m pretentious enough,) but I’m able to write about whatever I want, as longas it actually happened. 
Using “pretentious” even when just vaguely and loosely expressing other readers’ thoughts about your workis the first of many miniscule technical infractions against convention laid down in *X*’s arrangement whichproves to act toward the benefit of its experience. If you substitute *car nerds* for *sportswriters*, I’dpersonally identify with this picoautobiography in a big way, but more importantly as a *reader* I had neverencountered anything written about sports which I would describe as *pretentious*, per se, and thatrealization could very well have birthed enough curiosity to land the sale, had I been skimming in abookshop, which I would’ve eventually been pleased with. 
Now, during what we should hope to be the first dawn of a new microera of sincerity, we must recognizehow valuable it is for Klosterman as an observer to be comfortably engaged with his subjects, emotionally,and confident in the value of his commentary in middleage without the need to insist upon his eccentricity,as so many cringey, culturally-daft Dads do, these days. He uses keywords in his writing and spokenpublicity that *should* dismiss him immediately as one of these – a nostalgic, out-of-time dork – but areinstead somehow magically manipulated to *serve* him in articulating reasonable, even profoundly-innovative insight. As I have explored his bibliography and his publicly-expressed thoughts, I have beencaught up and hinged on a single supposition: **Chuck Klosterman is the only white, 46-year-old beardedPortland Dad you should be reading**. Do mind that I am in no way exempt from this lens, but it’s still myjob to determine his viability as an intellectual – a “thought leader,” even – for those of us who wereconceived around the same time he was wrapping up his collegiate sentence at the University of NorthDakota. 
For a solid hunk of the American reading audience, a quick, elemental vector of quality and mastery we lookfor in an essayist is the ability to “transcend” their subject matter for even the most presumptuous andconceited among us, usually to deliver a more abstract sentiment to leave with. Here, Klosterman’ssignificant career experience is irrefutably evident – in *X*, he achieves this transcendence organically with afluidity unlike anything I’ve read before. We can already check a single box: convincing even a youngprofessional twenty-something to shell out for a physical hardback of contemporary non-fiction requiring anysort of academic effort to consume is going to be nigh-impossible, even though *X* actually happens to bethe best-looking specimen of print product design I have ever handled across cover, type, and layout. It’sbeen difficult having to convince myself to give this copy back. 
In the interest of full disclosure, I must take special care to emphasize [just how highly](http://www.extratone.com/?s=recode media) I regard Peter Kafka as editor and interviewer extraordinairewithin the Media beat – well-proven to be capable of hitting consistently hard on both [novel](https://www.recode.net/2017/8/10/16115548/patreon-jack-conte-fan-pledges-subscription-paywall-recode­media-peter-kafka-podcast) and [old guard](https://www.recode.net/2018/2/1/16957324/wired-paywall­nick-thompson-magazine-advertising-subscription-peter-kafka-recode-media-podcast) industry personalitieswith refined, [seemingly unimpeachable](https://www.recode.net/2018/5/22/17380908/youtube-music­launch-10-lyor-cohen-interview-peter-kafka-recode-media-kanye-west-childish-gambino) stone-facedskepticism. However, this Chuck Klosterman interview for *Recode Media* is an uncharacteristicallydisarmed display of serious admiration: he introduces *X* with an outright confession: "It’s great. I boughtit. I bought a signed copy," which is an unexpected oddity (though not an unwelcome one – I’m glad Peterenjoys his life.) Their conversation dips briefly in personal history (Chuck and his wife moved to Portlandfrom Brooklyn for its proximity to family) before plopping down upon the substance of his clearly superb andmatter-of-fact interview technique. I’m not sure I’ve ever heard a conversation between Kafka and anyprevious guests with whom he was quite so obviously alike in general disposition. 
> The only reason I’m able to ask you these questions is because I’m a reporter and I can ask you questionsnow that I probably wouldn’t feel comfortable asking you if we were friends, so I’m not going to pretend thatwe are and I’m not going to create some fake thing where we’re going to have a relationship beyond thisconversation. I’m just going to ask you the things I want to know about and I hope that you respect the factthat I’m just being straight with you. I find that that works much better. 
From the broadest possible pop cultural lens, Chuck's most spectacular and widely-circulated work,demographically (I assume) is his [2015 interview and cover story](https://www.gq.com/story/taylor-swift­gq-cover-story) for *GQ* with Taylor Swift – then "the most popular human alive." Yes, it really *is* worthdwelling on the image: ***this guy***... this very Dorky Dad, just hanging out with the most highly-demanded teen idol who's ever lived, sitting awkwardly next to her in the backseat of her car as shemaniacally panics to accept a call from Justin Timberlake. When one Chucks such a distinguished contrastupon such a high-profile contemporary medium, the weight of the potential scrutiny becomes palpable, butKlosterman anticipates and braces for this (very risky) business in the only manner he can: acknowledging itover and over and *over* again in the second paragraph of his every interview appearance. 
> It doesn’t matter if it was complimentary or insulting necessarily. It would seem as though I wasn’t takingher seriously as a musical artist, and the idea is that I do. That’s why I’m writing about her is because I do think she’s a meaningful, significant artist. It’s not worth the risk of having the story then get shifted byother people who perhaps just perceive themselves as somebody who’s a watchdog for certain signifiers orcertain elements of the culture and that their job is to be on the watch for this. If your story then getsmoved into that silo, that’s all it’s going to be remembered for... It’s a touchier thing now. It’s a moredangerous thing. 
In the [print itself](http://bit.ly/ckswiftpreface), the cover story is prefaced by a very short butuncomfortably-telling complaint about changing expectations for culture writers. One might reasonablysuggest that Klosterman regards the practice of calling out or remarking on “creepy misogyny” as “dumb” –nothing but the byproduct of changing “times.” 
> Something you may notice in the following 2015 feature on Taylor Swift is that I never describe what shelooks like or how she was dressed, even though I almost always do that with any celebrity I cover... If I did,it would be reframed as creepy misogyny and proof that I didn't take the woman seriously as an artist. Itwould derail everything else about the story. It would **become** the story. 
But… *is it*? Note how desperately close his language comes to the *common white guy whining aboutfeminism* classification without *actually* fitting the bill. Right…? It *doesn’t*? Surely, it must be certifiedAwake through some combination of keywords or format I’m unfamiliar with or unable to visually registerbecause Klosterman’s ass would have long been grass, otherwise. These 224 words are *X*’s mostcontentious, which you could call impressive, all things considered – he appears to care enough about hispublic image to curate it somewhat diligently. When a motherhood blogger published [an open letter](https://atypicalson.com/2013/11/07/an-open-letter-to-chuck-klosterman-the-new-york-times-ethicist/) in2013 citing three very ableist uses of the R-word in his work, it only took him two days to [respond](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/kari-wagnerpeck/i-am-the-author-of-the-op_b_4319577.html): “I waswrong. You are right.” 
More than any other writer of his demographic, **Chuck Klosterman has a close, wary relationship with theeverchanging contextual boundaries of public expression**. He knows when to be transparent with hisfeelings on progression, and he's careful to avoid what could be "problematic" for the sake of functioningbetter as a writer (I assume.) For *Slate*'s *I Have to Ask* podcast, he managed to [speak extensively](https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2018/02/chuck-klosterman-on-how-the-approach-to-cultural-criticism­has-completely-flipped.html) about these mechanisms for nearly an hour without bellowing anythingdefinitively cringey. 
> I can’t say it’s better or worse. It’s just different, and because it’s different, it makes me feeluncomfortable, but there’s actually like an adversarial relationship with the history of anything, and thatsomehow that history is seen as oppressive. And you shouldn’t even know about it. It’s better to live in now. 
A quick jaunt from pretty horrendous to almost-ideal, then. If we are to place our faith in Chuck as our lastbearded champion, we must hope that last sentence is sincerely intended to be his lens to the changingworld. Granted – even if it *is* the truth – it’s not as if persistent acknowledgement of one’s position canmiraculously wash away any systematic patriarchal dynamics involved in authoring (or reading, for thatmatter) a high-profile feature of a young woman on cover of a magazine which explicitly seeks most tospeak to "[all sides of the male equation](http://www.condenast.com/brands/gq/)," (are you *sure about**that*, Condé Nast?) especially considering how unlikely it would've been for me to read anything aboutTaylor Swift outside of this very white man's anthology. Fundamental themes of power and control arethreaded throughout both his fiction and non-fiction, which is especially prevalent in the Macho Big Boycultures of the athletics and music industries. In profiling Taylor Swift – the undisputed apex of the latter in2015 – Klosterman provided a firsthand account of the grueling maintenance of a public and privatepersonality under tremendous strain from said factors as they were magnified to the max by the mostextreme celebrity. 
> Here we see Swift’s circuitous dilemma: Any attempt to appear less calculating scans as even morecalculated. Because Swift’s professional career has unspooled with such precision, it’s assumed that hersocial life is no less premeditated. 
I’m right there with Chuck: I’ve even found a fundamental pillar in Power and Control relationshipssupporting my own fiction experiments: **how we attain them**, **how we lose them**, and **how bestto make use of them** – all of which had apparently been quite problematic for Taylor Swift for most of heradult life, though we wouldn’t be allowed to *really* comprehend how deep her inner turmoil had drilleduntil it overwhelmed even her expertly-designed self-control four years later, [boiling over entirely](https://youtu.be/3tmd-ClpJxA) with such unexpected violence that all of America’s pseudorural glam-pop­country-glossy-chode-hipsters let out a simultaneous, dangerously-alarmed holler of *OH FOR PETE’S SAKE*that was actually heard and recorded from the overflying orbit of the International Space Station. 
> It’s somehow different when the hub of the wheel is Swift. People get skeptical. Her famous friends aremarginalized as acquisitions, selected to occupy specific roles, almost like members of the Justice League('the ectomorph model,' 'the inventive indie artist,' 'the informed third-wave feminist,' etc.). Such perceptionsperplex Swift, who is genuinely obsessed with these attachments. 
No, it’s not *only* worthwhile as an exercise in superbly athletic self-awareness – the Taylor profile isprofound. I’d recommend reading and treasuring it with or without the rest of the anthology because bizarreintersections like these are rare to come by from anybody else. Short, sharp, and occasionally somewhatpetty notions are what Chuck Klosterman does best and most originally. Thanks to a digression of Kafka’sbeginning with “you and I are about the same age…,” he arrives (by way of REM, believe it or not) at asignificant statement about youth and identity. 
> It seems strange to me to be into music for its coolness outside of high school. That seems like that’s theonly time when you’re a young person and you’re using art basically to create a personality because youdon’t have a real personality yet. 
Klosterman is debatably exempt from the traditional academic abstract of “objectivity” for the vast majorityof his notable work because of its stated primary subject: his “interior life.” Perhaps the success of his voicecould be at least partially attributed to his development of an existential muscle – a perspective uniqueenough to entertain, yet no less recognizably Midwestern with which he’s been able to reflect particularlyclearly on the profession in tandem with the experience he’s accumulated over the course of his career. 
> You know, when you’re young, you’re a real emotional writer if you’re a writer… If I was a young personnow, I would be incredibly attracted to the idea that when you’re 22 you can be a national writer, which wasimpossible when I was 22. 
In a way, Klosterman does surmise that it *was* indeed its objectivity that media lost, and that writing is nolonger a “one-way relationship,” but a sort of ridiculous dance in which “many people feel the reason they’reconsuming media is to respond to it… that it’s not for the content.” I would remind old Chuck that there arevery few functioning adults outside of academia or retirement in the United States who spend much of theirtime reading anything solely for the sake of absorption, and the disparity between those who were andweren’t was exponentially greater in the past. The story of American media is defined by its cycles of waningand waxing democratization, but many of the more traditional avenues in the business have bet on the “two­way relationship” to keep them relevant. 
My own favorite chapter of the collection is a [2500-word personal essay](http://grantland.com/features/space-time-dvr-mechanics/) constructed for *Grantland* to answer a singleincongruity: “**Why is watching a prerecorded sporting event less pleasurable than watching the samegame live**?” Some form of this question has at least mildly troubled every American since the 1960s,including myself, and Klosterman manages to provide an entertaining and concise analysis of this plightthrough his own wisdom. In its [short preface](http://bit.ly/ckdepressed) in the volume – which was written“in 2008, in Europe, when [Chuck] was pretend depressed” is the story of his encounter with a house-painting stranger, to whom he explains the meter for success in his opinion-manufacturing profession, as hesees it: “If a large number of strangers seem to think one of my opinions is especially true or wildly wrong,there is somehow a perception that I am succeeding at this vocation.” 
> Last weekend I was in a hashish bar in Amsterdam. It was post-dusk, pre-night. The music was terrible(fake reggae, late-period Eric Clapton, Sublime deep cuts.) I was sitting next to a British stranger with a 
shaved head and a speech impediment. Our conversation required subtitles, so I imagined them in my mind.He told me he had lost three family members within the past year: his mother, who was sixty-six; his uncle,who was fifty-six; and his sister, who was forty-six. He said he'd just turned thirty-six. He asked if I saw apattern developing. "Yes," I said. "But only numerically."> I asked what he did for a living. He said he was a housepainter. He asked me the same question aboutmyself. “I manufacture opinions,” I said.> “Really?” he asked. “How do you know if you’re any good at that?”> “By the number of people who agree or disagree,” I said in response. “If a large number of strangersseem to think one of my opinions is especially true or wildly wrong, there is somehow a perception that I amsucceeding at this vocation.”> “That’s interesting,” said the bald British man who could barely speak. “I guess house painting is a totallydifferent thing.” 
Rarely are situations or discussions that begin with *back in my day* actually constructive in any sense, butChuck Klosterman appears to be the exception. If you’re willing to indulge him, you may find yourselfreassured. He now writes from a remote cabin (with WiFi,) was tortured – like all of us – in sifting throughand compiling his old work for *X*, and finds its index to be his favorite part. 
> Exploring the index from a book you created is like having someone split your head open with an axe sothat you can peruse the contents of your brain. 
He is [willfully and completely ignorant of the *Harry Potter* franchise](https://www.esquire.com/entertainment/a3556/klosterman1107), yet able to sincerely [witness and convey](http://grantland.com/features/taking-concert-doubleheader-creed-nickelback-world-most-hated-bands/) thenuances of back-to-back Creed and Nickelback concerts in a confident, fascinating technique of which anyother music or culture writer would deprive you. He is “almost embarrassed” by his [emotional attachment](http://bit.ly/exrfastnet) to the Charlie Brown peanuts. (See: [Chuck Klosterman on Charlie Brown](https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/Chuck-Klosterman-on-Charlie-Brown-7jHNnij3saNFwtHt9Nika).) 
> I haven't watched A Charlie Brown Christmas in at least twenty-five years, solely because I can'temotionally reconcile the final scene. 
You’ll notice that his entire answer to the live television debacle is – again – entirely about control (or thelack thereof.) In fact, his relationship with and desire for control also contributed to his choice of profession. 
> Part of the reason I became a writer is because it was this completely controlled reality where I could dothis thing by myself where you’d go out and you’d do the interviews and stuff, but then you’re back byyourself, transcribing and then writing. Then, when the story is done and you send it off, that’s the end. Nowthat’s the middle. Now it’s like, when the story is published, it’s the middle of the process very often becausethe consumer feels differently now. 
While Klosterman’s voice is pleasant to someone like me, neither it nor himself necessarily belong to ThePeople. In his [*X* review for *Paste Magazine*](https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2017/05/x­chuck-klosterman.html), B. David Zarley proclaims essays to be “a love letter to a moment,” concluding thatChuck is “’effectively narcissistic,’ proving that culture essays can teach us something about ourselves *and*the people around us.” [For *The Washington Post*](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/sportswriter-and-rock-n-roll-philosopher-treading-two-sides-of­opposite-worlds/2017/06/30/3aba0fb8-23a5-11e7-bb9d-8cd6118e1409_story.html), Justin Wm. Moyer notes“it’s hard to think of another writer who could make a 30-page, deeply reported essay about a North Dakotajunior-college basketball game interesting,” suggesting that this new collection marks Klosterman’sascendance from **critic** to **philosopher**. From what I’ve read to date, I would counter that he hasalways fulfilled the term to the extent of its usefulness in the 21st century and is even now beginning toredefine it. Last January, he braved the “dystopic” Google Gates to [speak critically for a crowd of Googlers](https://youtu.be/HhGA9e-OiFY), describing them as “an umbrella over the entire culture,” and urgingcaution and reflection in the coming future to keep them from doing “something bad.” His engagement withthem – especially during [the Q&A](https://youtu.be/HhGA9e-OiFY?t=36m35s) – is a fascinating insight intothe Greater Google Mind, and I would encourage any invested parties in Chuck Klosterman’s role as a 
philosopher to watch the talk in full. I was unfamiliar with “the boat-sails-wind analogy” before I read [JamesMurphy’s interview](https://www.theguardian.com/music/2010/apr/24/lcd-soundsystem-this-is-happening)for LCD Soundsystem’s “last album.” 
> Your life is a boat, the sails are your emotions, and drugs are the wind. When you're a kid, your boat issmall and your sail is huge, and drugs are like a hurricane. 
**Control x Time = the Klosterman beat**. I suppose this must be what other entertainment writers arereferring to when they [accuse Chuck of nostalgia trafficking](http://www.dallasobserver.com/arts/pop­culture-critic-chuck-klosterman-talks-about-his-new-essay-collection-x-9559383), but I can’t be so sure.Though I’d like to think my own snout for the stuff is especially well-tuned, I am undeniably from a differentplanet – even auditorily. All but one or two of the musicians interviewed throughout *X* were entirelyunknown to me by name, which Klosterman’s voice managed to make even more compelling – *not tomention* the included stories of athletes and the sports industry, which include stories of the human ego,paranoia, and complex drama that always manage to transcend their setting when articulated with suchdexterity. 
I’ve never before written a book review of any sort – nor am I defensibly qualified to compare culture writers
– but with good ole’ Chuck, I dove much further in order to tackle one very important question: **shouldKlosterman be recommended reading for anyone under 30** above or alongside bestsellers like GeorgeSaunders or groundbreaking essayists of color like Hilton Als? In many a case, I must conclude by saying,simply, that *something* of value would be forgone if we shunned Chuck, even if his insight is old news toall but the most rudimentary yokels. I have little to offer women or people of color, but I’d bet *X* wouldprove itself worth a library trip for any idiot white guys in their lives who may be falling far behind. I don’tknow of any other voices who are in a better position to introduce these issues, nor any who are quite sopracticed at handling them delicately. While Jenna Wortham-level readers will gain little to nothing from thisexamination or the ecology of its subject (and will likely find themselves pausing momentarily for a deservedjest before moving on and returning to their high-level plane of complex neoliberal commentary,) but mostof their less-aWoken fathers should find in Chuck a man they can truly trust, who manages to consistentlydistill and articulate the need-to-knows of the most complex pop culture and pop science conversationswithout using any of the academic language found in most institutional discourse which daddy finds toocondescending and superfluous to bear. Those readers who’ve absolutely fucking *despised* my voice so farin this essay should give Klosterman a go – I take as much time as I can muster to fiddle with and seasonthe words in context like this work because **I basically \*enjoy\* the bullshit**, yet I’ve found both *X*and *But What If We’re Wrong?* remarkably refreshing and impressive exercises. 
> [These are] the cultural conditions in which I was raised under and which I pursued journalism under.That was part of the thing that drew me to the idea of being a reporter was I was like, this is something Ican do, I think. My ability to detach my personal emotions from what I am investigating, while not perfect, Ican do this. And now it turns out that the opposite is what’s desirable. I think it’s really going to change thekind of person who goes into media going forward. 
Reading Chuck Klosterman is going to be perturbing, but true sincerity is almost always uncomfortable.Comprehensively, his nonfiction represents perhaps the most important possible behavior to encourage fromboth the critic and his readership because it incubates and exudes **sincere curiosity** and a **genuineinterest in learning to listen**. From the perspective of quantified societal contribution, I’d argue thatKlosterman’s craft is a significantly more honorable and worthwhile pursuit than greater academic literaturein its unique and entertaining treatment of subjects the establishment tends to pulverize into minutia. Unlesshe’s broke and/or bookish, buy *X* as a gift for your Dad and at least give it a try when he’s done. Ifnothing else, *at least* **read the Taylor Swift interview**, okay? If he doesn’t enjoy the book, I’m alwaysavailable if one or both of you need to blow off some steam: **give me a call at (573) 823-4380**.(*Normal text messaging / talktime rates will apply*.)

# Digitizing the Soluble Protestant: Apple & The Megachurch Industry ![The Crossing Auditorium](https://i.snap.as/tEE74LR.jpeg) ## Askeptical spectacle in the day-to-day typhoon of Faith’s modern enterprise. 
The year I was given my first generation iPhone was the last of 14 through which my mother was stillcomfortable enforcing my obligation to attend Sunday morning church service. She and my stepfather hadmigrated 18 months or so prior from [Suburban Church of Mediocore Dope Christ-Appropriated LukewarmDilluted Prog Rock and The Occasional Teachings of Protestant-ish Side-Glances at The New Testament] tothe [*New York Times*-appointed champion](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/23/movies/how-the-true­false-film-festival-and-a-church-work-together.html) of Columbia Missouri’s [20-Year-Long](https://www.komu.com/news/mega-church-growth/) *Quirk the Church!* Soverignty Crusade: *TheCrossing*. Like its competitors (of which my parents’ previous church had ranked quite poorly,) the blatantlydeath-cult-sounding House of God includes its own artisanal, latte-equipped coffee shop (I wouldn’t besurprised if it’s *actually* a Starbucks affiliate at this point,) a regularly-replenished catering table full ofdoughnuts immediately to the side as one enters, and a sophisticated childcare operation staffed no lessthoroughly than my public elementary school. 
Since 2007, the church has been expanding from its first home (as a functional place of worship, anyway,)which lies within 1) line-of-sight from one of [Nancy Walton](https://www.insidephilanthropy.com/dance/2013/7/31/nancy-walton-laurie-ballets-next-best-friend.html)’sproperties, 2) a mile of the southernmost exit off US-63 - mid-Missouri’s primary North.South roadway ­and includes a powered pump-arrogated pond, though the majority of the acreage is blackened bypragmatically-arrayed big box store-caliber multi-rowed parking. Ye, by night, it is flooded in coordinately-distributed cold white light suspended by the same uniform steel poles which guard long-term airport lots.Naturally, the entry and exit points for the asphalt spread are arranged deliberately opposed so that fourfigures’ worth of God’s children may be fed, digested, and evacuated through their weekly appointment withChrist as efficiently and *hassle-free* as possible.

God’s ~white~ children become *especially* sensitive to entirely-trivial delay or other perceived deviationfrom Their Expectations when inside an automobile thanks to a rampant misconception that simultaneouslyallows them a renewed sense of control over their environment. Psychoanalytic observation has suggested itis catalyzed by delusions of physical anonymity, exemption from civic responsibility, and a titanically-inflatedperception of their personally misattributed contributions to the perpetuation of the universe. This vehicularcomponent of the customer experience is a fundamental ingredient in *The Crossing*’s stellar memberretinenance record - the single metric above all quantifying a Christian organization’s overall effectiveness inaccomplishing the faith’s (mostly cross-denominational) evangelistic Prime Directive / General Order NumberOne as [abridged by Christ himself](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+28%3A18­20&version=NIV) to the Pharisees after his resurrection: “go and make disciples of all nations, baptizingthem in the name of [The Holy Trinity].” I did not take the opportunity to sample *The Crossing*’s baptismalservices, but I’m sure sufficient combing of [the church’s Yelp! page](https://yelp.to/qTKq/U3zCk0HlEY)would yield as qualitative an analysis of such a “service” as you could possibly imagine. (Notably, it wouldappear the “lowest” review is [the singular 4/5 star entry](https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-crossing-columbia?hrid=1iW1Q9KCi9WlM3mDzNFvKw&utm_source=ishare).) 
I do not mean to disparage *The Crossing*, specifically nor even organized religion, generally, but instead toemphasize the absurdities which have leapt just as readily into what I’d specifically call *The Business* ofwhite protestant Christianity over just the course of my own maturation as it has into any other aspect of ourlives. The difference, of course, is the universal set of exceptions - and the particular *age* of saidexceptions - which religion maintains, societally. The perspective formed by my own experiences havinggrown up wholly embedded across the spectrum of white midwestern Christianity - including two years of vigorous and quite academic study of the Bible in a tiny private school headquartered in the basement of aLutheran church - lends to a particular skepticism, amusement, horror, offense, and existential astonishmentthat latches my fascination into a not-entirely-voluntary hold. 
(Before I go on, I suppose I should also note that it’s been at least two or three years since I last set footinside the church building at all - my *only* recent experiences/engagement with *The Crossing* has beenwith their digital content from a relative distance.) 
![The Crossing’s Pastors](https://i.snap.as/E5RLm4y.jpeg)![Apple Leadership Headshots](https://i.snap.as/B8TX5h0.jpeg) 
The ludicrous parallels between Apple events and services at *The Crossing*, especially, come immediatelyto mind every single time I watch one (live or otherwise,) as they did just weeks ago when I first engagedwith [this summer’s WWDC keynote](https://youtu.be/psL_5RIBqnY). Pastors [Dave Cover](https://www.thecrossingchurch.com/staff/dave-cover/), [Keith Simon](https://www.thecrossingchurch.com/staff/keith-simon/), and [Shay Roush](https://www.thecrossingchurch.com/staff/shay-roush/) all look, dress, speak, and photograph *exactly* likeSteve Jobs, Tim Cook, Scott Foristell, Jony Ive, and just about any [public-facing leadership figure](https://www.apple.com/leadership/) we’ve ever seen giving an Apple Keynote. They’re hilariouslyinterchangeable, as are other explicit aspects of the typical Sunday morning service at *The Crossing*. Asfar as I can tell, the church as a whole *only* uses Mac computers and the projections in the mainauditorium/worship hall - mostly sing-along hymn lyrics and referenced bible verses - are exclusively createdthrough Apple’s office presentation software, Keynote, just as the company itself does for its “Keynotes.”This was immediately obvious to me upon first entering that space because **they both use the defaulttheme** - typography, color palette, transition animations and all. Indeed, during the sermons, the threepastors would take command of the slides by fairly inconspicuously clicking what I’d imagine must be a verysweaty Apple Remote in the *exact* same manner in which Tim Cook and his underlings still do. 
**I JUST REMEMBERED DAVE EXPLICITLY USING MENTION OF APPLE PRODUCTS IN HIS SERMONS** 
![The Crossing on WordPress](https://i.snap.as/s1Qh8Rz.jpg) 
Nay, the likenesses do not diverge when comparing the fundamentals of the two organizations morebroadly: *The Business* of the faith is very much a *volume* business, which also describes Apple’scontemporary strategy with perfect precision. It’s been a few years since “[ecosystem](https://www.forbes.com/sites/ericjackson/2014/06/03/apple-isnt-a-hardware-or-software-company-its-an­ecosystem-company/)” ceased to be an [exhaustive buzzword](.https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?hl=en-US&tz=300&date=today+5-y&q=apple+ecosystem&sni=3.
) in tech media discourse, perhaps becausethe term falls very short in expressing the change in global Apple **scale**. My recollection of high schoolbiology has failed to produce a scientific substitute, but I find Matt Honan’s “[very lovely swamp](https://www.wired.com/2014/09/apple-ecosystem/)” exceptionally said in 2014, but the fact of the swamp’sbecoming generally lovelier in the interim - in a less linear fashion than would have been ideal, mind you ­leaves ample room, I think, to fear and respect whatever it was that we then called *The Apple Ecosystem*in 2014 as a **ruling deity or daemon** (just as [Google’s sought to be](https://extratone.com/google-soul­ledger-dont-be-evil), recently.)

I genuinely wonder quite often if the individual who set the digital template for the sign in front of ourPortland neighborhoood’s Episcopalian church paused to look at the text he was arranging: “PRAYERREQUESTS BY EMAIL.” I'm not sure any of this really means anything, but it's sure spectacular to look at.

# Write.As Interview with CJ Eller 
*I was [interviewed](https://write.as/community/chat-with-david-blue) by Write.as Community Manager [CJEller](https://blog.cjeller.site/) about writing software, Extratone, blogging, and self-curation.* 
**So I am super curious that you mentioned Markdown as something that saved you from fiddling your lifeaway. Can you go more into that?** 
I started an online magazine four years ago originally on WordPress. I thought I knew something about webdevelopment, but honestly I did not. It ended up becoming a fixation on trying to make something*technically* different from what I'd seen done with WordPress, which detracted heavily from my Editorialduties over the years. I'm on the OCD spectrum so I just couldn't let it go. I spent thousands of hoursfiddling with different themes and formatting within those themes, and what I ended up with was a mess. Iwould make changes that would break old posts, so I'd go back and fix those, only to make more changesdays/weeks/months later and have to go back again. I'd known vaguely about Markdown, but it wasn't untilit was mentioned in the WordPress dev Slack that I really considered it seriously as a way out of what I'dbeen doing. I realized that its inherit limitations were actually very good for me - that I needed a limitedsystem to constrain my workflow to keep myself on task. Finally, in late-2018, I started to convert our oldcontent to Markdown and essentially haven't looked back since. 
**Did it take a while for you to accept Markdown's limitations? Was there a turning point for you? Did youlook for a Markdown plugin on WordPress to help after making the change? I imagine there's something likethat out there.** 
There are third-party plugins, yes, but I believe the new WordPress editor now supports "[markdown blocks](https://wordpress.com/support/wordpress-editor/blocks/markdown-block/)," which is sortof handy for thosewho want to continue in that direction. The turning point was probably when we ran out of money and lostour account with our hosting provider. I was left with an old external HD full of old backups and an emptydomain. I'd already started moving that direction within WordPress (largely because of the [Gutenberg editorproject](https://wptavern.com/wordpress-core-editor-team-publishes-ui-prototype-for-gutenberg-an­experimental-block-based-editor),) but losing the site in its entirety was what I really needed to push us intoa more modern, progressive CMS. Honestly, Markdown is capable of everything we *actually* need andnothing more. I'd like to think I was able to realize this from the beginning. 
**So you're left with an old external HD full of old backups and an empty domain. Talk to me about theprocess then of finding that modern, progressive CMS. Did you have a vague idea of what you were lookingfor? I imagine getting those backups ready for whatever you were going to choose as another processentirely.** 
I actually decided to ditch the backups and just move forward with a different Editorial direction (the projecthas since been more or less put on hiatus.) I knew Markdown had to be involved and that I never wanted tolook at anything like WordPress' dashboard ever again. I played around with a local Ghost instance but justdidn't *feel* anything for it, if that makes sense. I'd already moved my [personal blog](http://bilge.world) toWrite.As months before and eventually realized that it was just what [*Extratone*](http://extratone) needed
-so far, I've only imported my own contributions and the most recent work from others. 
**Could you explain what you mean by *feeling* something for a piece of software? I noticed this in your[recent post](https://bilge.world/poweruser-tips-software-shortcuts) on your personal blog and what Ienjoyed about it so much. There's an enthusiasm about the software you do recommend that jumps throughthe screen. I want to use [Bear](https://bear.app/) after reading your post.** 
I'm glad to hear that! I suppose it dates back to my upbringing on a farm in rural Missouri, where I felt areal affection for - and attachment to - our tractors, combine, and such. When one cares about their work, Ithink it's inevitable for them to be emotionally invested in the tools they use to accomplish it every day. 
During my brief stint in IT in the beginning of 2019, I saw a lot of users struggling with outdated andridiculously unintuitive software throughout their entire workday and it made me really appreciate the idea of"good workflow." I'm not really a developer, but I believe software can always be better because I've seenit. As an End User of sorts with not much cash, I feel like my main contribution back to developers should becelebrating their good work. This is an idea I feel I do not encounter enough in day-to-day life. 
**As someone who also had a brief stint in IT, I totally agree with the struggles people go through becauseof outdated & unintuitive software. But IT also made me realize how much of software is personal —someone will want a solution that's unintuitive to you but is intuitive to them. You learn a lot of empathyfrom that.** 
**I am intrigued by your last point there — why don't you think you encounter the idea of celebratingsoftware developers enough in day-to-day life?** 
I suppose specifically I mean I don't see enough celebration of *good* development. It's hard to challengethe personal workflow of anyone, yes, but I hope folks will continue to want to better their lives with newsolutions. As I mentioned in my Tips post, Microsoft Word is a great specific example of software that simply[*should not* be used anymore](https://slate.com/technology/2012/04/microsoft-word-is-cumbersome­inefficient-and-obsolete-its-time-for-it-to-die.html) - especially in composition for The Web. Not that Word is*celebrated*, necessarily, but **its alternatives are not**. It should be noted that I have no specificauthority in this matter other than years of experience with - and enjoyment of - playing around withsoftware. I just think that End Users deserve better than they get, and awareness of new/different softwareis a huge part of the problem. Making average people aware of better solutions should be the primaryfunction of special interest tech journalism, IMO. 
**Great point about Microsoft Word. I don't even remember the last time I seriously used it — high schoolmaybe? And like you said, discovery can be an issue to the adoption of these alternative tools. So are thereany common patterns you've noticed as to how you've come about these software alternatives that you nowuse? Patterns that someone could adopt?** 
It's not that I slave away, but it does take a lot of time to discover them. The simple answer is: I drink a lotof caffeine and hyperfixate on the internet. I'm not sure it's something the average user should *want* toadopt, but if they do, they should be [on Mastodon](http://joinmastodon.org). They should be googling"alternatives to..." regularly, and they should worship Free and Open Source Software. Accepting that younever have to settle for one piece of software is probably the beginning. For lack of a better term, I just love*playing around* with software. That's not something I would advocate for my old clients or other End Users
-I would rather find out myself and then present a list of alternatives in an entertaining way. I hope that'san appropriate and sufficient answer hehe. 
**No that's great! The acceptance of never having to settle for one piece of software is at once valuable andchallenging to adopt. If you keep switching you could be a sort of software vagabond who throws their datainto a rucksack to head to the next viable platform. I've always had trouble trying to find the proper balancebetween playing around with software & learning a tool well enough that it can be useful. How have youpersonally navigated that? I could imagine your foray into & out of Wordpress as an example.** 
It's always a challenge when trying new things. I obsess over different ways to accomplish tasks. I'veprobably signed *Extratone* for 15 different newsletter services (including [Buttondown](http://buttondown.email) today) though I haven't actually written a single edition of our newsletter innearly two years. I think it's only recently that I've been able to look at these habits from a reasonableperspective. As in, I am now able to finally differentiate between playing and being productive, but it tooksome 15 years. Self-awareness of one's actual progress is key. Asking questions like *why am I actuallydoing this - for profit or for play?* Differentiating between these two is something someone like me willalways struggle with, I think. 
**The distinction between playing and being productive can be quite blurry. I sometimes find that playingaround with a piece of software can lead to a productive use of it. How about you? Did you start with theidea of creating *Extratone* first and then tried to find the right software to fit the job? Or did you start playing around with Wordpress and then the idea of the digital publication took form soon after?** 
That's an insightful supposition. I actually tried to launch an online magazine before *Extratone* withvirtually zero editorial focus along with a standalone podcast that I'd been hosting on WordPress for years. Ioriginally began playing around with WordPress sites in my early adolescence, so you could say it allculminated in the idea. It took maturity to realize that I actually wanted to build a platform for *other*voices rather than continue to invest in my own. I'd like to believe that was all enabled by the playing hehe. 
**So what lead you to the conclusion of building a platform for other voices? Especially curious from the*maturity* angle. Because you still have a [personal blog](https://bilge.world/), so it doesn't feel like you'vecompletely neglected your personal voice. But would you consider that as not the same investment of time &effort that you'd put into something like *Extratone*?** 
I should be clear that I have *not* accomplished what I set out to do with *Extratone*. After a fairly bigpersonal trauma in 2015, I had a bit of an existential crisis and realized that I had surrounded myself with somany talented (in a particularly relevant way) online friends who were producing all sorts of incrediblecontent - music and videos, mostly. I realized that I was better at editing and other platform duties than Iwas at writing, and that perhaps the online communities I was astride could be provided a single banner togive themselves. In that sense, I haven't figured out how to do what I set out to yet. Ideally, my bylinewould be completely gone from *Extratone*, so I've more or less put it on hold until I figure out how toaccomplish that. Turning it into a somewhat profitable media company is still my biggest long-term life goal. 
**The curatorial characteristic you describe is underrated, even though the "everyone is a curator" idea isjammed down our throats all the time. There's something about this curation on a person-to-person levelthat still has lots of room for experimentation. On that subject, do you have any examples of communities,sites, or models that guide where you'd want *Extratone* to go?** 
My citable aspirations in that regard have been somewhat superficial, I'm afraid. From a technicalperspective, I really admired what Joshua Topolsky was [trying to do](https://www.niemanlab.org/2016/08/newsonomics-sketching-in-the-details-of-josh-topolskys-new-outline/)with [*The Outline*](http://theoutline.com) - which just [closed this month](https://www.niemanlab.org/2020/04/the-outline-an-attempt-to-build-a-bolder-kind-of-news-site-appears-to­have-met-its-end/), actually. They built their own CMS including a bespoke advertising delivery platformwhich really looked *great* but they just [couldn't figure out](https://www.niemanlab.org/2018/10/the­outline-built-itself-on-being-weird-but-is-it-weird-enough-to-survive/) a sustainable editorial focus. In myfantasy world, I have the connections and digital media insight of Topolsky and know how to apply them in away that supports *our* community because I don't see any one brand popping up any substantialumbrellas over the electronic musicians I know. (It wasn't until "too late" that I realized *Extratone*'s soleeditorial focus should have been electronic music all along.) I read a lot about media but I'm pretty picky asfar as hero worship goes when it comes to my own professional goals. I once promised that *Extratone*would *never* run ads, so I could see some sort of non-profit classification working out in our future. Ibelieve I could be an excellent curator - I'm just not quite sure how to get there yet. 
**I think you're a great curator — had to ask that question of influence because I think you have a uniquecuratorial presence on the web. Just saw you tweet about [tractordata.com](https://www.tractordata.com/).Who else would recommend that? Love it. That's why I thought [Are.na](https://are.na/) would be right upyour alley.** 
**So you emphasized "*our* community" there — what do you define as your community in that broadercontext?** 
Well thank you! That's a question I'm still struggling to define. **Electronic music** is about as far as I'vegotten. I met most of my talented friends on Twitter over the past 10 years or so and have tried to containthem in a [list](https://twitter.com/i/lists/1032269790616858625) before. There are innate challenges indefining such a creative community - I have done my best to label without being constricting, but it'sdefinitely difficult trying to figure out how to provide a flag which everyone feels comfortable flying. I stillthink the best I've done to articulate what I'm trying to say was for [*Extratone*'s About page] (https://extratone.com/about). Most of the folks I'm talking about are used to hustling their own brand soit's been a real challenge working on the right way to reach out. 
**A flag which everyone feels comfortable flying — that's a great way to put it. What I find interesting aboutyour internet presence is that you defy the idea of flying just a single flag. Along with *Extratone* you have[multiple](https://anchor.fm/extratone) [podcasts](https://anchor.fm/davidblue), [multiple](https://bilge.world/) [blogs](https://dieselgoth.com/), and now you're starting a [Motorsports & Techdedicated Mastodon instance](https://mstd.racing/).** 
**I've been thinking a lot lately about how important it is to have many online buckets to put your ideas in.One just feels too limiting, especially if it's solely linked to your legal identity. How do you think about thismatter of identity & expression with your own online presence?** 
That's a very good question. I can't take credit for [mastd.racing](https://mastd.racing), actually - I'm notsure who created that server but it's administered by an account called [RaceControl](https://mastd.racing/@RaceControl). You've arrived at another one of my biggest challenges. Consolidatingmy interests has always been a problem, especially on The Web. Age has definitely helped narrow themdown a bit, but I still can't help myself sometimes. I think it's ended up alienating a lot of my followers onsocial because I have a hard time posting just within my niche(s). I'm not so sure how to feel about this,honestly. One could argue that I should post whatever I want, whenever, but *consider your audience* isalso a concept I can no longer ignore. If anything, I need to learn to let myself be limited a bit *more* bythose buckets. Once again, *Extratone* is a good example of this - I should've never published app reviewsthere, but I did. We're all learning, I suppose. 
**Do you feel like you have to even learn to limit yourself on your [personal blog](https://bilge.world/)? Itseems like a personal blog can act as the release valve — a way of getting around cornering yourself into theniches that *Extratone* and other projects require. You can freely write about [pens](https://bilge.world/preferred-writing-instruments) and [Picard](https://bilge.world/star-trek-picard-review)without feeling constrained to a single subject.** 
I think I'm just now coming around to understanding personal blogging and the freedom that entails. It'sbeen a long while since I've had the urge to write about things on which I don't consider myself at leastsomewhat of an authority. I think - like many people - I originally just used my personal blog as a guinea pigfor messing around with themes, and I'm just now actually catching up on some of the lesser items on my"to-write" list. Since we've begun talking I've begun building my blogs bookmark folder back up andfollowing the [#100DaystoOffload](https://100daystooffload.com/) challenge, which I find immenselyimpressive. I can't say I'm quite up to it, personally, but I definitely plan on opening up the taps a bit more.(I also don't want to flood [read.write.as](https://read.write.as/) with too many joke posts ya know hehe.) 
**That's awesome! You're reminding me of the interesting relationship between writing & tinkering when itcomes to blogs. They both feed into each other in a strange way. Before, when my blog was on Wordpress,I didn't care about tinkering around — writing was my sole focus. When I moved to my new blog, however, Ifound myself shift towards creating apps that extend my blog and messing around with its CSS. So it'sinteresting that you've gone the opposite way, publishing more instead of solely tinkering.** 
**What has awoken the urge for you to tackle those items on your personal "to-write" list? To open up thosetaps a bit more? Because I can see the publication mindset, being somewhat of an authority, getting in theway.** 
That is interesting. I'm wondering how many people are in each of our camps. I hate to be so topical, butthe pandemic and being home constantly has definitely contributed. I've also begun to learn to let things go,which is an essential skill. Being able to actually kill work when it needs to die is the real secret. I just builtup the strength to delete the rest of my 2019 list a few weeks ago. 
**I wonder also! And hey, no problem bringing up the current situation. I think it's making me write morealso.** 
**Want to drill into that practice of letting go as an essential skill for blogging. As a final question for thischat, how have you gone about the decision of keeping ideas that you've had for a long time and when to letthem go? It's been something I've been struggling with for recently as ideas for blog posts start to pile up.** 
Self-curation is definitely tough. Generally, it's very hard to let things go - especially when I've progressed atall significantly into research/first drafting, but I know when to kill something if I reread and am unable toimmediately see where I was going. I've noticed that trying to rekindle interest or momentum in a topic isunusually not a worthwhile use of time in my case. If I can't get my rhythm back fairly early in, I am veryunlikely to, ever. That said, I think it's also important to *forgive yourself* for investing time in somethingthat won't work out - otherwise, you will settle for less than what you originally intended and releasesomething you won't be happy with. 
Thank you so much for your time! I really enjoyed this! 
**Forgive and forget! That's a great point about rekindling an interest being a sign of letting go of an idea.I've done that too many times. This has been a blast to chat virtually David — really enjoyed your thoughtsand am looking forward to future blog posts and installments of *Extratone*!**

Yes, I am still managing to waste my time digging up and re-arranging some *very* old content, but I just couldn't resist. Somehow, it didn't occur to me until yesterday evening that I could sort through the original video files of my old vines fairly easily in fucking Google Photos and blast them through iMovie for iOS into a full montage relatively easily. 
Some of these are very cringey... 
Yes, I'd love to finally get around to my ultimate romantic editorialization on that most dearly departed social network, but things are way too jumbled right now, obviously.

# Indulging Once More in Digital Excess 
![So Much To Do, So Much To See](https://i.snap.as/f1fGg1B.png) 
## An update on all I’ve been doing instead of what I actually intended to do. 
> There will always be plenth of things to compute in the detailed affairs of millions of people doingcomplicated things. - Vannevar Bush, "[As We May Think](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1945/07/as-we-may-think/303881/)" 
> Everything happens so much. - [Horse_ebooks](https://twitter.com/horse_ebooks/status/218439593240956928) 
*You have a desire for indulgence in your home and family*, [Co-Star](https://www.costarastrology.com/neoyokel) has just told me in my weekly, email newsletter-deliveredhoroscope. “Venus conjunct to natal Moon” indicates *this part of yourself will transform into somethingelse*, and goes on to say something truly stirring: ***the way you relate to your past is changing\***. Icontinue to be amazed by how influential the potential of the computing hardware present in my life at anygiven time can be on my habits. In the two weeks I’ve had [my first moderately powerful desktop computer](https://www.davidblue.wtf/hp-envy-desktop/) in over ten years, I have found myself using new image &video editing software, installing local WordPress stacks, finally experimenting with Git, somehow generating20 draft posts on [a fresh experimental WordPress site](https://www.davidblue.wtf/), and putting my wholeback into my new Notion account, including – among others – projects like my “[Keyboard Shortcuts Wiki](https://www.notion.so/rotund/Keyboard-Shortcuts-Wiki-9b4567d5b41447638cd6330aed7c2a1b).” All thewhile, there has been a pull toward a more deliberate, focused sort of digital existence: reflection on [KevinMcGillivray’s Word of The Year concept](https://www.kevinmcgillivray.net/word/), [digital gardening](https://tomcritchlow.com/blogchains/digital-gardens/), and a few other like discoveries have culminated in anewfound, unironic use of the term “[Creative Wellness](https://www.notion.so/rotund/Creative-Wellness­b43e3df6f4b94333aa97ea98b67cb760)” to describe a set of ideologies which I believe I should strive for inorder to improve my intellectual wellbeing. 
In tandem with the fact that I have [gone back to school](https://www.davidblue.wtf/college-return/), thishas all crucially resulted in very little *actual writing*, which may or may not be conclusive evidence towardthe classical minimalist technology argument that less capability results in more focus. On that note,remember when [the *Game of Thrones* author appeared on Conan’s show](https://www.theverge.com/2014/5/14/5716232/george-r-r-martin-uses-dos-wordstar-to-write) andmentioned that he still writes exclusively using WordStar 4.0? This happening has been vaguely in the backof my mind since I encountered it during the relatively brief, basement apartment-dwelling era in Oregonwhen I first discovered WinWorldPC and got into running a bunch of DOS VMs, trying out every downloadfrom that blessed site which sounded even remotely interesting. Before I go on, let me just include atranscript of the entire anecdote I’m referring to here, because it’s actually much shorter than one is led tobelieve: 
> **Conan**: These novels that that you write are can be over a thousand pages long. They're massivetomes and apparently you write them all on a computer, but unlike most authors, you're not worried about acomputer virus. I mean an author who writes a thousand-page book their greatest fear is a virus invadesand destroys a chunk of their book you don't worry about that. Why?> > **Martin**: No I have a secret weapon - I actually have two computers: I have the computer that Ibrowse the internet with and that I get my email on and I do my taxes on and that computer and then Ihave my writing computer which is a DOS machine not connected to the Internet.> > **Conan**: A DOS machine. How old is this program? > > **Martin**: A DOS machine. You remember DOS? I use WordStar 4.0 as my word processing system.> 
> **Conan**: Did you make this computer out of wood? Did you carve it? I'm curious why you decided tostick with this old program. 
> **Martin**: I actually like it. I mean, it does everything I want a word processing program to do, and itdoesn't do anything else. I don't want any help. I hate some of these modern systems where you type alowercase letter and it becomes a capital. I don't want a capital - if I wanted a capital, I would've typed acapital. I know how to work the shift key. Stop fixing it! 
> **Conan**: You yell at computers a lot. What about spellcheck? > > **Martin**: Oh, I hate spellcheck. Especially when you have the realm of [???], it's [???]. 
That’s it! A less than sixty second exchange. I did not remember just how much coverage it received ondigital news sites. Embark on a Google search for “[george rr martin wordstar](https://www.google.com/search?q=george+rr+martin+wordstar),” and you’ll discover a ridiculously longlist of brief stories including the YouTube embed. A book I’ve just recently discovered and begun – which Iam extremely excited about – is Professor Matthew G. Kirschenbaum’s [*Track Changes: A Literary Historyof Word Processing*](https://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674417076), and its introductionbegins by mentioning *The George Thing*, which surely indicates that it is the most significant mention ofword processing software in popular culture for at least a decade: 
> The clip was posted to YouTube and from there embedded in innumerable tweets, Facebook feeds, andblogs. Some commenters immediately, if indulgently, branded Martin a Luddite, while others opined it wasno wonder it was taking him so long to finish the whole story (or less charitably, no wonder that it allseemed so interminable). But what was it about these seemingly obscure details that people found socompelling? Part of it was no doubt the unexpected blend of novelty and nostalgia: Many fans would be oldenough to remember WordStar for themselves, and the intricacy of its interface seems somehow in keepingwith Martin’s quirky persona, part paternalistic grandfather and part *Doctor Who* character. WordStar thusbecomes an accessory to his public image, like the black fisherman’s cap he is frequently photographedwearing. But it is also clearly much more than that. Martin’s passion for the program is unmistakable... 
The book, itself, was also more widely reviewed than one would expect, where it was deemed genuinelyunique. I *related* quite hard to the preface’s first few sentences: 
> *Track Changes* began, as many books do, with a question: What was the first novel written with a wordprocessor? Being an English professor interested in the history of writing as well as computers, I thought itwas the sort of thing I should know, but I didn’t. 
Discovering the volume was a result of a personal determination in the last week to give in to my latentobsession with word processing/text editing software, which also led to my creating [a Notion table of everyword processor I’ve ever heard of](https://www.notion.so/rotund/0f3f754d5a4b46cb99bd3e1c0a2e1159?v=a85e98bc06424b72a3a249a87cb62101). Thanks to my desktop PC acquisition, found myself virtualmachining a bit again, though some of the programs I’m particularly interested in trying have inexplicitlydisappeared from my personal library and been removed from WinWorldPC, probably due to (mostly absurd)copyright claims. Most versions of WordStar are [still available](https://winworldpc.com/product/wordstar),though, and I’ll confess I still have a desire to learn how to use its cult keyboard shortcuts, [as evangelizedby Robert J. Sawyer in an essay](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2017/03/wordstar-a­writers-word-processor/) *also* discussed in *Track Changes*, which specifically shits on WordPerfect moreexplicitly than I remembered. I keep returning to the idea that I should try writing the stuff I normally workon – like this post, for instance – in these software, but file transfer is a bigger and bigger obstacle the olderthe OS you’re running: VirutalBox’s “[Guest Additions](https://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch04.html)” –which allow clipboard sharing/shared folders/other interoperative network functions – are not compatiblewith DOS or any Windows editions before 4.0. There are workarounds, but I haven’t found any reasonablywithin my current abilities. 
Truthfully, though, emulating twenty-year-old software seems a bit unnecessary when contrasted with thefact that Markdown, Typora, and Writeas were [supposed to be my saviors] 
(https://write.as/community/chat-with-david-blue) from distracted writing. A compulsion to comment on a[recent note-taking app comparison published in *The Information*](https://www.theinformation.com/articles/tech-execs-are-obsessing-over-note-taking-apps-we-tested-them­out) reminded me that I *still* haven’t written an in-depth review of Typora, which I plan to prioritize in thenear future, especially since it may finally be officially releasing, according to [recent activity on Twitter](https://twitter.com/Typora/status/1289586532353900544). 
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">some gorgeous themes added toTypora&#39;s theme gallery recently. <a href="https://t.co/oFXop0W9ZU">https://t.co/oFXop0W9ZU</a><a href="https://t.co/mZ3OwAqrv6">pic.twitter.com/mZ3OwAqrv6</a></p>&mdash; David Blue(@NeoYokel) <a href="https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/1307551063810158594?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 20, 2020</a></blockquote> <script asyncsrc="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script> 
Another result of my reintroduction to academia is that I can now afford a subscription to Adobe CreativeCloud thanks to student discounts. This has been life-changing in a manner which I should probably be a bitashamed of, but once the desire to *make full use* of my subscription (by trying every single program itlicenses) subsides, I really do intend to become proficient with [InDesign](https://www.davidblue.wtf/t/Adobe-Indesign/) – a learning experience which I will surely at least attempt tothoroughly document, here. 
## Digital Gardening 
I think it was [Tom Critchlow’s Digital Gardening blogchain](https://tomcritchlow.com/blogchains/digital­gardens/) that first exposed me to the term and [his static site-generated wiki project](https://tomcritchlow.com/wiki/) that introduced me to the concept of personal wikis, not so long ago,though the desire to organize and/or archive personally-relevant information through the format has actuallybeen rattling around my head for the better part of a decade. When I discovered that one could install[MediaWiki](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/MediaWiki) – the platform Wikipedia, itself is built on – Icreated the shortlived *Drywall Wiki*, once upon a time. Since I last wrote you, I also purchased the[extratone.wiki](https://extratone.wiki/) domain and played around once again with the platform. Typoraeven offers exports in MediaWiki’s bizarre proprietary text format! For better or worse, though, I don’t seeanything becoming of the project for the moment I suppose it feels like somewhat of a risk, investing a lot oftime I probably shouldn’t have into documenting all of my Twitter jokes. For the moment, I think my Notionaccount will have to serve as my personal wiki. 
The most inciteful argument I’ve read among the Digital Gardens discourse revolves around *value* as it iscreated within our personal online writing spaces. Two of the many infinitely-quotable essays within thisspace: Mike Caulfield’s “[The Garden and the Stream: A Technopastoral](https://hapgood.us/2015/10/17/the-garden-and-the-stream-a-technopastoral/)” and “[Stock and flow](http://snarkmarket.com/2010/4890)” from *Snarkmarket*. The former references Vannevar Bush’sinfamous “[As We May Think](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1945/07/as-we-may­think/303881/)” essay (which I’ve finally gotten around to finishing and its description of a “memex,” whichmany cite as a disturbingly-apt prediction of the World Wide Web. Caulfield, however, disagrees: 
> So most people say this is the original vision of the web. And certainly it was the inspiration of thosepioneers of hypertext. But in reality it doesn’t predict the web at all . Not at all. The web works very little likethis. It’s weird, because in our minds the web still works like this, but it’s a fiction. 
Reading back from a lens including this commentary, I immediately understood. The *memex* concept is farmore intimate than the web has become (or perhaps ever was – I wouldn’t know.) “Stock and flow” definescreative value in two disparate types of media: 
> **Flow** is the feed. It’s the posts and the tweets. It’s the stream of daily and sub-daily updates thatreminds people you exist.> > **Stock** is the durable stuff. It’s the content you produce that’s as interesting in two months (or two years) as it is today. It’s what people discover via search. It’s what spreads slowly but surely, building fansover time. 
To be honest, I personally cannot imagine undertaking the task of explaining this differentiation to *anyone*in my own life, but if the reactionary movement within The Web back to a focus on *valuable* content is,indeed, underway, perhaps such conversations are bound to shortly become more and more natural. For mypart, I have attempted setting up an experimental site on Github Pages using Jekyll in the past few days withpartial success: as soon as I tried to specify a custom theme, I apparently broke it, at which point I realizedthat I had homework to do. As much as I hate to admit it, [Kev Quirk’s posts regarding WordPress’*practical* simplicity over SSGs](https://kevq.uk/static-site-generators-revisited/) earlier this monthringssomewhat true. As things currently stand, WordPress’ permeability throughout The Web is an *advantage*for those who just want to publish something as simply as possible. My counterargument to both Kev andmyself: **[Writeas](https://write.as/) is a wonderful compromise** in terms of substance and *image*among one’s super e-enabled, Mullenweg-disgusted peers. It’s very much pure Markdown, but it’s far moreaccessible, cross-platform, than SSGs due to its shear simplicity. 
One component which Digital Gardening would seem to offer others that I have never particularly struggledwith is the freedom to write whatever I feel like writing. If anything, I have struggled in the opposite sense,existing in a state *completely unhindered* by consideration of the value my work may or may not offeranyone else. Perhaps the most substantial addition I’m capable of making to the Digital Gardensconversation, then, is best quoted from the first chapter of the advice book I have finally begun writing foryoung men, *[For God’s Sake, Just Sit Down to Piss](https://www.davidblue.wtf/writing/projects/piss/)*: 
> If there is one idea of mine you ever engage with – in this book or otherwise – it is best distilled in thissingle sentence: **you do not \*actually\* want to attain a state of true apathy**, trust me. It is extremelyunhealthy, miserable, and alienating. I have existed for an excruciatingly long time trapped in a state ofbeing truly unable to care about anything in the face of a great, varying effort to do so. It is very far fromthe immunity imbued in terms like *carefree* – in reality, it is manifested in extreme depression. It is less*immunity* than it is *distance* from an essential part of life. 
In terms of one’s blogging, I am glad for those who will/have/are finding a new freedom of expression, buthold this as a serious caution regarding the *other* extreme. Should you ever approach it, remember that*considering one’s audience* – as academics love to prioritize – really *is* important, eventually. 
## Curation 
At this point, I’ve used [a channel in *Extratone*’s Discord](https://bit.ly/extratone) as my ongoing readinglist for several years essentially without change. Earlier this month, though, I discovered Raindrop – abookmarking service with public collections that (so fars) feels much more aligned with my own needs thanPocket – and pretty much immediately signed up to begin paying for it and set up a bot to crosspost from[my new Reading List collection](https://raindrop.io/collection/13380406), there to the same Discord channelvia [the collection’s RSS feed](https://raindrop.io/collection/13380406/feed). Raindrop’s browser extension –along with Notion’s, come to mention it – is *actually usable* in day-to-day browsing. As much as I love[Reading.am](https://www.reading.am/davidblue), the prospect of its longevity worries me considering themost recent post in its [development blog](https://writing.reading.am/) dates to 2016. Writing a dedicated“[Little Review](https://www.davidblue.wtf/c/software/little/)” of Raindrop is on my (ever-lengthening) todolist, but at the moment, I would especially emphasize my [Digital Magazine Collection](https://raindrop.io/collection/13419360), which is the result of thousands of hours of web exploration andgenuinely worth significant value for most anyone, I think.

With the combination of my public Notion workspaces and public Raindrop collections, I hope to make mycuratorial endeavors both more accessibly beautiful and more intimately available. In terms of a dedicateddiscussion of Notion’s interworkings and culture, I think I have quite a bit more exploring to experiencebefore I’m sufficiently qualified, though my notes are already quite extensive (and [publicly accessible](https://www.notion.so/rotund/Little-Review-Notes-228e10a1d3fe453fac69c9244a24ee3a), thanks to…Notion!) In general, I continue to be astounded by the amount of tools/services/applications I *have notyet* heard of, despite how long I have labored to become an authority on Writing Tools. 
![Too Many Fonts! - WordPerfect](https://i.snap.as/mPEMBma.png) 
## Workflow 
In my endeavor to more intentionally design my workspace – to actually dedicate a space for working,originally – I originally very much intended to set up dual displays for my desktop, but the desk I settled for(an old family piece from the early 1900s?) does *not* have enough surface area to position two displays,regardless of how thin they’ve become since I last had one. Combined with a limited budget and a concernthat two displays might actually result in *further* distraction instead of less, I instead went for a single, 27”LED affair. I’ve also been making full use of [Windows 10’s desktop switching feature](https://www.cnet.com/how-to/how-to-use-multiple-desktops-in-windows-10/) and have found it surprisinglyeasy to make a habit, especially thanks to the **Ctrl+Win+Lateral Arrow Keys** keyboard shortcuts. 
![Hildur Keyboard Shortcuts](https://i.snap.as/lEx7zen.png) 
On the subject of keyboard shortcuts, I’ve by now worked out a personally-optimized remap (thanks to thekeyboard manager tool included with [PowerToys](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerToys), about which Ihave *far too much* to say in some future post.) I had [a conversation with a few Mastodon friends](https://mastodon.social/web/statuses/104843391967830863) two weeks ago convincing me that mymethodology of forcing myself to learn shortcuts by integrating a cheat sheet into my desktop backgroundsmay actually be an *original idea* and useful to other users. 
In terms of writing spaces, I have actually been composing the less serious stuff I’ve been writing withinWordPress’ Gutenberg editor, which is *not* an admission I would’ve expected to be making, just a yearago. A dedicated post about this, too, is *fucking coming*, but suffice it to say that with a fairly-substantialPC and a better hosting provider (DreamHost over GoDaddy, in this case,) composition has become *far far*smoother – improving enough to make it a viable space within which to pound away original stuff for thefirst time. Writing essays for academia has encouraged my return to Microsoft Word, once again, on whichI’ll blame the fact that I am currently composing this very bit in The Old Bitch. A desire to once again hacktogether a set of personalized Word templates has led to the birth of two such files which I am proudenough to [share on my Notion drive](https://www.notion.so/rotund/Configuration­2efccc31e19540c294b2bc5b7cfa4863). Eventually, I would also like to take the time to completely redesignthe “Ribbon” in Word – something which I’ve literally never seen anyone else do. (I spent a substantialamount of time trying to find a library for MS Office customization files, to no avail, though you can find my own customization file as it stands on the same Notion page linked just now. Let me know if you’re able tosuccessfully import it.) 
![Woke Word](https://i.snap.as/gsVHo1z.png) 
A confession of vanity: I suspect the only reason I haven’t yet stopped composing within WordPress is that Ifigured out how to change the typeface to Adobe Caslon (across both the editor and the front-facing site,naturally,) thanks to my newfound access to Adobe Typekit. Yes, apparently I really *am* that shallow. Forthose Office 365 users among you, I *highly* suggest you look up [how to enable the Classic Office soundtheme](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/turn-off-annoying-sounds-microsoft-office-2016/). Unlike *MakeUse Of*, I find them both adorable and genuinely useful as auditory feedback. You may also be interested inmy discovery of [some fairly-Woke additions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/style-guide/bias-free­communication) to Word’s autocorrect options and the [subsequent bitchy controversy](https://www.foxnews.com/tech/microsoft-ai-word-politically-correct) their introduction spawned. 
![Software History Society Banner](https://i.snap.as/YHk2EhE.png) 
## The Read-It Website 
If you know me at all, the following admission probably seems unbelievable: I have been *using Reddit*. Icreated a [new subreddit for *Extratone*](https://www.reddit.com/r/extratown/) – which I do notnecessarily expect to be populated any time soon – and [r/SoftwareHistory](https://www.reddit.com/r/softwarehistory) after discovering that it didn’t yet exist, which I *definitely* donot expect you to populate, but would be delighted if you did. As with seemingly everything else I’vecovered, I *also* intend to write about how Reddit’s recent feature additions and redesign may *actually*make it a redeemable space on The Web, which should prove interesting. Clearly, I have become more thanwilling to accept the moniker of *Software Historian* whenever/if ever my authority achieves the appropriatevolume to deserve to be christened so. 
Obviously, none of the developments I’ve shared in this post indicate any improvement in my productiveoutput, but I hope to learn soon how to settle into a fairly-consistent (and hopefully much more original)writing process.

# Discord is Better Than Slack 
![Discord Art Orange](https://i.snap.as/szp1oaF.png) 
## Why Extratone has used Discord instead of Slack for our team chat. 
Back in 2015, I hosted a pre-*Extratone* culture podcast called [*Drycast*](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2zjkrB28csR68YoY1M1eSk) with musician friends from all over the net. Torecord remotely, we originally used Teamspeak 3 - a gamer VoIP staple. When I discovered Discord, Ithought we'd found podcasting heaven. Originally, the free plan included 128kbps audio in its voicechannels, which was nearly twice what we were getting out of our *paid* Teamspeak server. If I were stillpodcasting, Discord's [just-released server video feature](https://support.discord.com/hc/en­us/articles/360041721052-Server-Video) would undoubtedly prove invaluable for live streams. 
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">are you thankful for Discord?</p>&mdash; David Blue (@NeoYokel) <ahref="https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/1261334179352100865?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 15,2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script> 
According to [a poll I ran on Twitter](https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/1261334179352100865?s=20),2/3rds of all people on Earth are thankful for Discord's existence. This is not surprising considering whatevery Discord user is still offered without spending any money at all: community spaces with audio/videoand text chat capability, organizable by Twitch and YouTube-integrated roles with a plethora of differentpermission options, instantly and easily shareable by customizable temporary or permanent invite linksthrough an application that's about as cross-platform as one can get (Windows, Mac, Linux, Android, iOS, orsimply one's web browser.) Those of us that remember [IRC](https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/1244758973867229185), Ventrilo, and Teamspeak should all considerDiscord a tremendous gift.

Never before have so many VoIP, video, and text chat features been offered together, or in such a beautifulpackage. "What we really did was create an all-in-one voice, video, and text chat app that replaced thisconstellation of tools that people would use," said CEO Jason Citron in [an interview with CNBC](https://youtu.be/NNJ2n6XKmmA). Technically in terms of these details, Discord *has no competition*. Slackoffers text and voice chat with its paid plans, yes, but nothing close in terms of video - especially considering[Discord Go Live](https://www.polygon.com/2019/8/9/20798559/discord-go-live-private-stream-voice­channel), its fairly-new streaming feature, which allows users to stream game video directly to 10 otherusers in the server. With some jury-rigging, it's possible to simply screen share this way, which is anessential sell for business video communication applications like Skype.

"Discord and Slack have many similarities, but Discord is the superior tool," says [esports team ArdentUnited](https://medium.com/ardentunited/why-we-use-discord-and-not-slack-500ac8027824). "Discord hasvoice channels, which allows us to easily chat with our supporters and other team members. Discord alsoallows us to set user roles and permissions which makes moderation extremely simple." It's not just gamingcompanies, though. Decentralized cloud platform Sia also [moved their community](https://blog.sia.tech/sia­
is-moving-from-slack-to-discord-195f87feb6a6) to Discord: 
> Its intended audience is gamers, but many large communities have switched from Slack to Discord,including development communities like [Reactiflux](https://facebook.github.io/react/blog/2015/10/19/reactiflux-is-moving-to-discord.html) and [UnrealSlackers](https://medium.com/@polymoon/unreal-slackers-is-moving-to-discord-c93492eb0612). It includesan unlimited number of users, unlimited file uploads (with a per-file size limit), unlimited message histories,and really great moderation and spam filtering features. 
Slack is [often praised](https://www.pcmag.com/reviews/slack) for its integrations, but it shares supportwith [Zapier](https://zapier.com/blog/slack-vs-discord/) - a dedicated web integration service which more orless integrates them equally. 
> Slack works with [a long list of tools](https://slack.com/integrations), including Google Calendar, Zendesk,Salesforce, Wunderlist, and dozens of others. If you're looking for an integration that isn't immediatelyobvious, you can always turn to Zapier for help, because Slack is a supported service. Zapier is an onlineservice that creates integrations between other apps and services, without you having to know any code tomake it happen. 
For sharing detailed post embeds, there's also [Discohook](https://discohook.org/), which I just discovered.Productivity company Chanty's blog wrote perhaps [the most in-depth comparison](https://www.chanty.com/blog/discord-vs-slack) of the two services (emphasis theirs): 
> At their core, Discord and Slack and very similar. Both are **team chat apps** with a similar interface.Both apps have **team communication organized** in channels. The biggest difference between the two istheir **target audience**, and of course, their **specific features**. 
Ultimately, one must decide how relevant the services' respective target audiences are to productivity. For anot-for-profit media organization like *Extratone*, Discord's features-for-price ratio is simply too rich to passup.

# The Email Chic 
![Xerox Alto](https://i.snap.as/TdR9BlV.jpeg) 
In all likelihood, you have heard of Electronic Mail, but I’ve noticed that much of our audience (and 18-25year olds in general) have been consistently estranged from it, despite its [prevalence](http://www.journalism.org/2017/02/09/part-ii-characteristics-of-news-instances/) in news media. Perhapsit’s not immediately evident as *the coolest thing*, but if “staying informed” and grass roots-ing brands arestill as hip as they appear to be, email newsletters *should* soon become so groovy that you’ll begin leavingthe house for a down-the-street coffee shop *just to be seen reading them.* 
## Welcome to the wonderful world of *aggregation*. 
In many ways, email newsletters are the antithesis of (and medication for) Facebook’s school of ruminateaggregation. You know - the doctrine that will forever be remembered as the original intellectual catalyst forthe downfall of human civilization. The skimming and the jumping… how many Facebook users could I foolby simply sending featured images, headlines, and abstracts for social cards without any hyperlinkeddestination? Could I manage to get Donald Tump elected President of the United States by way of ScrollingHypnosis, alone? 
Staying *informed* is a habit of time-honored traditions. Gramps has stopped by Bill’s General Goods everyweekday morning for twenty years with a handful of change because *The Sleepyville Monitor* is a part ofhis identity - dependent upon- and accountable to his trust. We’ve continued into 21st century news mediaas if a digital equivalent of his readership would be *so* difficult to fathom that legacy publications are best-off forcing the standards of print onto the web instead of investing in research/experimentation, which iswhy the fucking *New York Times* still sends your handset away to a separate *mobile version* of their site
-a horrible remnant of browsing from the oughts that’s rarely seen on *blogs*, these days, much less onproperties of titanic news powerhouses. 
For whatever reason, most of the industry has behaved as if Grandpa’s sort of routines no longer exist inday-to-day life, but - if anything - our Automated Hell is *vastly* more saturated with them, no? Unlessyou’re sequestered away in a diligently self-made *Email-Free Zone*, you’re receiving shit daily. I, myself,am considerably proud of my ~60,000 unread emails, and I’ve conceded to the vast majority of the popupopt-ins I’ve encountered since shortly after our launch because I rarely found myself visiting/readingundesirable web. 
“I don’t email” is a sentiment I hear from young people often, which is perfectly fine. I don’t vote! 
If it’s true that “nobody wants that,” nobody should be participating in the democratic process. Yes, I’veexperienced the *no patience for more than 300 words* phase of life, and I understand wholeheartedly thedesire to retreat forever from it all. I would much rather exist in an old, open farmhouse with a wife, agarden, no internet, dusty old literature, and two ancient Bentleys than spend all my time crafting mirages ina black mirror, but neither cowardice nor negligence are options for us, right now. This country doesn’t haveroom for any more. 
That’s not to say that you should be *expected* to read 6 hours of news a day - it’s the media’s (our) job tomaintain our own accessibility, and for this, daily/weekly newsletters are an unbelievably effective method.The meta-aggregators in today’s industry are often paid *exclusively* to ease your digestion, bothindependently and by mastheads. 
[Dave Pell](https://twitter.com/davepell) is a superb gateway from the former - an aggregation legend. Hisdaily correspondence - called [*NextDraft*](http://nextdraft.com) *-* is more often than not the ideal frontpage of the day. 
![POLITICO Playbook](https://i.snap.as/FBb5naU.png) 
I’m asking those of you youths yet without your own reading habits to trust my taste - if not my authority ­and explore some options from my own inbox. 
Ultimately, you just can’t replace a legacy die-hard-news shop for a good political briefing. The [*POLITICOPlaybook*](http://www.politico.com/playbook) is the most time-efficient way to keep up with U.S. and Worldpolitics as you walk about your life, and many of [*The New Yorker*](https://www.newyorker.com/newsletters?mbid=nl)[’s newsletters](https://www.newyorker.com/newsletters?mbid=nl) are a great longform, much more visual compliment. Fora *slightly* less-chaotic, but still relatively unproven alternative to the former, try [*Axios AM*](https://www.axios.com/axios-am/). 
*National Geographic* may seem a bit *old guard*, but has remained a consistently excellent photographicpublication. Its print edition has no place but on the poll in tangible media subscription terms, but it *has*been quite depressing, as of late. Turns out, we’ve made quite a dystopia for ourselves, and their ability toencapsulate the world can be overstimulating, at times. If you’d like a bit more control - or areuncompromisingly digital-only - its web edition has matured quite competently, and is elegantly parsed by[their newsletters](https://members.nationalgeographic.com/). (You’ll need to create an account, if you don’talready have one.) 
![Medium Digest](https://i.snap.as/JP71lXK.png) 
It’s no secret that Medium has been on the decline, lately - and it’s always required a particular sort oftolerance - but *The Daily Digest* still delivers a few important essays, occasionally. And of course - thereare options by regularity and topic, which you can fiddle with [here](https://medium.com/me/settings) whenlogged in. 
On the more innovative end of the industry, there’s [*The Outline*](https://theoutline.com/post/1125/subscribe-to-the-outline-newsletter)[’s newsletter](https://theoutline.com/post/1125/subscribe-to-the-outline-newsletter), which - being the property of a moredeliberate, gorgeous, open-web publication - is a bit underwhelming, but then again… why aren’t you justlooking at the site, anyway? [*The Pudding*](https://pudding.cool/)’s output may be sparse, but - again ­just… *look at it.* I can’t claim to have made much use of the information presented in their gorgeous visualessays, but it sure is fascinating. 
*The Verge*’s [Command Line](https://www.theverge.com/newsletter) is often so clever, *it can almostmake tech news engaging*. (Our very own [*The Tone*](http://bit.ly/thetone) is directly modeled after it,visually.) *WIRED*’s [newsletter](https://www.wired.com/newsletter) isn’t bad either - it’d be excellent if itsparent website wasn’t so *fucking broken.* 
Then there’s [*War Is Boring*](https://warisboring.com/) *-* a tactical/tech news site? I recentlydiscovered. “From drones to AKs, high technology to low politics.” I wouldn’t describe it as a primary read forme, but it’s still nice to see what the Big Boys are up to, once in a while. (I am mostly just waiting attentivelyfor the *U.S.S. Iowa* to be put up for auction.) 
If you’re a filthy word nerd like myself, it’s likely you’ve seen a Tweet or two from the [Haggard Hawks](https://twitter.com/HaggardHawks) account - [Paul Anthony Jones](http://www.paulanthonyjones.com/)’highly-educated musings on “obscure words, language & etymology facts.” After an excellent few years ofplayful indulgences, the project now has a whole DweebNet with a [newsletter](http://www.haggardhawks.com/newsletter) that always fascinates, if a bit dryly. What did you expect? 
*The Poetry Foundation* can also be [easily convinced](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/newsletter) tosend you their Poem of the Day, and biweekly newsletter. 
And finally… **the meta media folks**. 
*Columbia Journalism Review*’s always the prettiest to look at when it comes to coverage of industry, andtheir squeaky-clean perspective won me over quite quickly. They send their ultra-clean, editor-compiled [*Weekly Highlights*](http://archives.cjr.org/resources/) every Thursday. [*The American Press Institute*](http://bit.ly/apneedtoknow)[’s list](http://bit.ly/apneedtoknow) isn’t a bad idea, either. Then, of course,there’s Harvard’s *NiemanLab*, which offers [afternoon and Saturday morning emails](http://www.niemanlab.org/subscribe/). All three often cite the *Pew Research Center*, which offers i[tsown palette of email lists](http://www.pewresearch.org/follow-us/), should you find yourself *hungry for d at a*. Though, I do not, and I enjoy them. 
Landing on the “homepage” of even the most familiar online publications can feel daunting and impersonal,but having an authority on the industry (hopefully, with some sense of humor) parse the torrent and deliverit unto *your personal inbox* can ease the reading process into a *much* more intimate, sensical,enjoyable, and productive expenditure of your valuable time. 
For a publication of our scale, the routine of a newsletter can act first as a simple reminder of our existence,and mature into a way to reach out directly to our audience in a distinctly *magazine* methodology - onewhich pervades a real, consequential relationship with consumers. 
And it’s d i g i t a l !!!!

# Eugen Rochko, Saint of Federated Social ![Mastobird](https://i.snap.as/creNKgg.png) ## Eugen Rochko has spent this year perfecting federated social media in Mastodon â€“ his open source project. We 
spoke to him just hours before it became a global tech conversation. The saga of Twitter, Inc. has been rejuvenated in 2017 by Tump's antics, corporate drama, and an amalgam of user and non-user disquiet with its decisions, though its financial viability has been in prominent industry conversation for half a 
decade. Since its pre-2010 outset, many 'a' feature has accumulated on its original, still-iconic skeletal software, and ­though the net is undoubtedly positive - a few have gone. Last Thursday, the company revised in bravado its poultrian default profile picture and its system of replies to exclude 
@s on all of Twitter's proprietary services, drastically changing two of its visual mainstays, and prodding a particularly lucent cacophony. Turn your ear, and you'll hear many familiar terms in the chants: *limits, chains, strings, harassment, feedback, gamergate, nazis, etc.* 
These conversations are important, but they've gotten awfully stale. If you listen a bit more carefully, you'll intercept a new one: *Mastodon*. It's the open source brainchild of Eugen Rochko, who's known colloquially as [Gargron] 
(https://mastodon.social/@Gargron). He's had one hell of a week. Between the night of our first emails and our conversation, his flagship [mastadon.social](http://mastodon.social/) 
instance had doubled in users. Less than two hours after we said our goodbyes, his name was on *The Verge*'s front 
page. Despite the urgency of it all, he graciously lent me his time just after breakfast on Tuesday to discuss himself and the story behind the project, while the most significant day of his life was building around him. 
"I'm perfectly fine with being called *Eugene* by Americans." Though the ink's still fresh on his compsci diploma, he's clearly prepared for the American press. https://open.spotify.com/episode/6QKhv7jaZsAHJxBjyiyZf7?si=I_eqn5Q6Q2aXi04Nq10LJw <iframe src="https://www.listennotes.com/embedded/e/03ad43227da74d489d11dd6a804fe09d/" height="auto" 
width="100%" style="width: 1px; min-width: 100%;" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" loading="lazy"></iframe> 
**What's the story behind the project? Do you remember the specific moment when you decided to do this?** 
Many years ago, I had a friend that was really into federated networks when they were a new thing. That was when [identi.ca](http://identi.ca/) was first created - at the very beginning of my developer knowledge and career. 
A good portion of the stories written so far on his platform have framed it as an alternative to Twitter, which early Masto adopters refer to as "Hellbird," or "the bird website." Eugen isn't afraid to acknowledge his investment in the 
format. 
I was a heavy Twitter user and I wasn't happy with where Twitter was going, so I decided to check on how the federated stuff was doing in the meantime. I found it in a very sad state, but thought I could contribute. He began building on his own, with Tweetdeck's standard in mind. > I thought 'if I'm going to do something, it needs to have realtime updates and it needs to have columns.' I started with 
a bare-bones prototype while still [at University] in May or April of last year. It had no user interface, only an API that I 
was using from the command line. And I thought 'okay, it works. that's great.' Then, exams came. Academics had to come before the project at first, but it soon supplied an ample post-graduation diversion. He focused his energy on building something more complete and eventually launched a [Patreon page] (https://www.patreon.com/user?u=619786). 
> I [announced](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=13303346) it on HackerNews, and that was the first public release of the project. That's when I got my first users who weren't my friends, and some who were new to federated networks. 
That was just over 100 days ago, and it gave way to his first feedback. > I started working on the first feature requests, shaping the project a bit differently. People were a lot more focused on 
privacy features than I thought they would be, although in retrospect, it makes sense. The previous [federated] project ­GNU social - did not really have a focus on privacy features, or anything built in by default. It compelled him to change things, and his work was well received. > Over time, I kept working on new features, and waves of new users came when it went viral in certain circles. The 
first was HackerNews and Product Hunt. [Aral Balkan](https://twitter.com/aral) - a Twitter user with over 30,000 followers - picked up the project, gave it a shout out, and even did a giveaway of his app. He had a lot of followers from Holland; the Mastodon timelines became mostly Dutch. 
Next was Marxist anime Twitter (including *[Extratone](http://mastodon.social/@extratone)* and [I] 
(http://bit.ly/dbmastodon).) Lots of furries; lots of LGBT people. That's when I really focused on privacy features and making sure all blocks worked because these individuals needed a safer platform than Twitter could offer. 
![Sidekick dashboard background processing jobs as of Tuesday morning.](https://i.snap.as/0bAIHB6.png) *Sidekick dashboard background processing jobs as of Tuesday morning.* "As you can see, the first bump is HackerNews, the second is Aral Balkan, and then anime/Marxist Twitter." And the last - now a bit out of date - is this week's spike, which is nearly double all previous waves. **Are you responsible for all of the code?** You can look at the [GitHub page](https://github.com/tootsuite/mastodon) to see a specific breakdown of who 
contributed and how many lines of code, each. You'll see I'm at the top by a large margin, but there are [additional] people who've contributed interesting, good features & fixes, localizations, user guides, and documentation. **What's the story behind the name?** 
It's not particularly interesting. I'm a progressive metal fan, and I listen to *Mastodon* sometimes. They have a really cool name that refers to a really cool animal. It's a fluffy elephant! What's not to love? 
It's also the inspiration for Mastodon's mascot, which was penned by Rochko's YouTuber friend [Dopatwo] (https://www.youtube.com/user/dopatwo) after he realized how urgently he required an error page. 
**What does "federated" mean to you?** 
The biggest problem with this term is that it's new for lots of people. People who've come across federated networks in the past*instantly* understand what it means and how it works, and people who are new to the concept have a lot of trouble before it clicks. But when Twitter first started, people didn't understand what 'retweeting' meant, so it's not a unique problem domain. 
I don't know where it comes from - maybe BitTorrent - but people seem to think that when something is 'decentralized,' everybody gets the same thing; that it's all synchronized one to one. In actuality, 'federated' means that people in different instances can *talk* to each other, but the *content* is different depending on the users there, what they do, and who they follow. 
Though instances are infrastructurally independent, they can communicate with one another. On a user level, timelines are still determined by who you do and do not follow across the entirety of all instances. 
**What if Twitter comes to you in the near future with a job offer?** 
[Rochko laughs.] 
If it was any other company, I would think about it. A job is a staple source of income, and - depending on the company 
-could involve doing something important, but I have zero faith in Twitter. 
**Does this all mean that I finally get to live out my serif Twitter dream?** 
Yes, I suppose on your own instance, you could change the stylesheet... 
**So if I set up my own instance and started charging for its use, I'd be in the clear, legally?** 
Yes, that's okay. The code is licensed under [AGPL](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.html) version three, which I picked because other projects in the same space are using it. The difference between AGPL and GPL is that [the former] forces you to contribute back to the appstream code repository if you make any breaking changes. 
For example, Eugen explained that WhatsApp originally used XMPP for its chat protocol, which meant that Facebook and Google Talk users could connect to it, too. However, the company progressively locked down the platform over time, leaving virtually nothing visible that was unique to XMPP in its current iteration. 
To prevent somebody taking Mastodon code, placing it behind locks, and stripping out the federation part to make Twitter II, I'm using this license. 
The thing to remember about free software is that 'free' means *freedom of the user,* not that it's zero cost. It's perfectly fine to charge for free software because developers need to live, too. 
**I've seen a lot of multilingual 'tooting' these past few weeks. Can we expect an in-app translate function like Twitter's on Mastodon?** 
I don't think I could put in a 'translate this toot' button because APIs from Google and Bing are quite expensive at scale. I'm not 100% promising this, but I can probably put something in where people can select which language they post in, and then just filter the timelines. That would at least solve the problem of being confronted with lots of French posts, without knowing any French. 
**The only complaint about Twitter I remember that hasn't already been addressed here is the capability of editable 'toots.' Is that a possibility?** 
That won't happen. There's actually a good reason why they don't do that. It's simply because you could make a toot about one thing, have people favorite it and share it, link it from other places, and then suddenly, it says 'Heil Hitler,' or something. 
![Mastotile](https://i.snap.as/jrP0kLj.png) 
It's a bit preposterous to continue the conversation as if Twitter and Mastodon are interchangeable entities. They exist in separate ideological and mechanical spheres, and will both continue to do so for a very long time. 
That said, the fundamental user interface design and current cross-community user saturation *do* warrant comparisons between their functions. More likely than not, you'll create a Mastodon account because a link found you on Twitter, use it because you prefer its type of ecosystem, and you'll stay after realizing that nearly all of your age-old qualms have been addressed, if not already rectified. While *FOSS* and *Federated* may seem at times like jejune ideologies, their advantages are especially tangible in this context. Should you find yourself needing to complain about something, you'll find an audience. Perhaps it'll be your command line. 
It's nothing but negligent to describe Mastodon as an *alternative* or *clone*. 
It's more like Twitter's son. 
It's leaner, quicker-to-change, much more flexible & democratized, and less corrupt. Though I didn't ask its creator what he intended to gain from all his effort, I think his commitment itself denotes a preoccupation with progress. Those of you who've been let down by the tools you've been given to control your words' exposure will find startling competence in your ability to determine per-toot privacy, or reserve your raucous photos and terrible memes from followers who are not necessarily complicit consumers. Naturally, it's also much less dependable, though a single instance outage will never leave you truly, completely silent. And the support will come. 
It's been a privilege to be observer and participant in the first lightening of a new online community. In the moment, we enjoy our lavender haze -when the spaces are filling primarily with users who are sincerely interested enough in discourse to have sought it out. 
Sarah Jeong's [account](https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/mastodon-is-like-twitter-without-nazis-so-why-are­we-not-using-it) of her Twitter exile is a good, long read if you're craving more specifics, and Eugen's [Medium] (https://medium.com/@Gargron) offers a more complete explanation of federation and its place in the industry, straight from the source. Apparently, he's just as articulate with words as he is with code.

# Evernote, Dropbox Paper, and The History of Word Processing 
![Epson](https://i.snap.as/Bcm2sD3.jpeg) 
## The recent history of the software and services we use to retain text, and how their development affectsour behavior on the page. 
I have only once in my many using years been gripped by the fear of the Lord because of a software-relatedevent. I was cruising my pitifully ugly Google News feed on an October afternoon in 2015 looking for the lastlittle bit of material for the evening’s episode of *Drycast*, when I happened to spy the words “[Evernote isin Serious Trouble](http://www.businessinsider.com/evernote-is-in-deep-trouble-2015-10).” I doubt Iscreamed or anything, but I definitely remember experiencing a very real, full-body shot of adrenalinebecause *my entire creative life* was contained at the time within the nearly 40,000 notes I’d amassed onmy Evernote account since the service’s [open beta](https://web.archive.org/web/20120904074223/http://blog.evernote.com/2008/06/24/evernote-public­launch/) in 2008. In fact, I was in that very moment using it for the live show notes and so began to wonderhow I could possibly continue if Evernote were to be suddenly killed dead. For better or worse, though, the“unicorn” would indeed survive to see its tenth birthday this year, though it’s arguably been eclipsed by thenotetaking, journaling, and word processing services its features predated and for which it was the mostsignificant forerunner not so long ago. 
I’d been using the cloud-synced notetaking service for all of my composition and research gathering sinceJunior High, when I thought myself extremely clever with my cloud-syncing, iPhone-native notetaking appwhen I’d watch other students struggling to find a flash drive or log in to their email on school librarycomputers. Since it worked with any browser and my password was memorable (before the brute forceapocalypse and the need for password managers,) I could access my documents, mp3s, and images *fromanywhere,* which was actually a pretty big deal — especially as more research and notetaking was requiredin high school. 
Yes, 10 years later, we are *swamped* with infinite duplicates of documents from our personal clouds,which are now inescapable and plenty — they follow us around from our pockets, purses, and backpacks andrain notifications down upon us for single punctuation mark peer edits, unnoticeable modification conflicts, orsometimes just for the hell of it. There are now what seems like infinitely many available ways to enter, edit,and publish text from wherever you happen to be, and most of them are free, but very few are actuallypleasantly executed tools — all of which can all be said of most types of software now. Since techpublications (and even tech *bloggers* now,) aren’t doing software reviews anymore because you won’tclick on them, the task of comparing between the lot so that you might be spared having to mess aroundwith *all* of them to find out for yourself — the function of consumer journalism — has fallen to myself,alone because the *Fear of The Unclicked* is not known to me. 
To assist me in bearing this terrible burden, you can allocate 1–3 minutes to [**take the survey I created**](http://bit.ly/howwewrite) about the text-entry tools you use to determine which tools people use atdifferent points in their writing process and across several uses. It would be very much appreciated. 
## Feature Fucked 
Reading this via printed PDF, your hypothetical 100% offline grandmother — the successful children’s bookauthor who needs word processing but doesn’t require connectivity because she doesn’t do research orcorrespond with anyone — might ask *well whatever was the matter with Microsoft Word? Surely I don’tneed more than that!* Technically, she’d be correct in a major sense: Word has been able to sync viaMicrosoft OneDrive between PC or Mac with iOS or Android for a while now, but I wouldn’t vouch for thelatter for any use other than reading or very lightly editing a document because the relationship between themobile apps and their desktop counterparts is inevitably strained. Because Microsoft Word is such oldsoftware, it’s filled with some obscure functionalities I’m sure even its creators have forgotten. Over yearsand years of development, these tools have been stacked on top of one another so that actually masteringthe labyrinth could be a college major in and of itself. 
![Word Processing Survey Pie Chart](https://i.snap.as/JUh9srV.png) 
Basically, you can tell your grandmother that **Microsoft Word is a huge old bitch**, but it’s still theindustry standard for formatting and publishing works at the end of the line. As you can see from our surveyresults, **58.1% of you use “legacy” word processing software to finish up your first drafts** (as of May30th,) which makes you more modern than even a slightly-older population, I’d wager. 
While we’re on the subject of the old hag, it’s worth pointing out how ridiculously behind the times its opensource “alternatives” are. **OpenOffice**’s last major update was the [release of version 4.0](https://blogs.apache.org/OOo/entry/a_short_celebration_and_then) in July of 2013, and it’s not correctlyscaled for the small, high-DPI displays sold at just about every price level, nowadays. It was okay when Icouldn’t afford to pay for a license in high school (and saw no reason to,) but it now looks sort of awful,especially considering that the version of Office (and therefore Word) to which I’m comparing its screenshotsis actually *also* from 2013. 
The other, “fresher” open source option of the moment is called **LibreOffice Writer**, and its suite hasbeen attracting a fair amount of praise — I think “[every bit as good](https://www.zdnet.com/article/libreoffice-the-best-office-suite-gets-even-better-with-libreoffice-6-0/) [asWord]” is taking things a bit far, but its sixth version looks significantly better than OpenOffice on *my*machine, at least, and generally operates more smoothly as well. That age-old banner of *Open Source*won’t matter for much longer, though, if all kinds of software continue to be abandoned and substituted withProgressive Web Apps for [no damned reason](http://bit.ly/uselists). Considering how much time some of ushave already spent in front of Word, it’s no wonder we’re spoiled: even my 5-year-old edition of MicrosoftOffice syncs with the app on my iPhone (with some pleading,) and looks *extremely* crisp. As far as paidfeatured desktop-class alternatives, there’s just one more: **WordPerfect**, which I have never used orheard anyone else mention.

## The Hybrids 
When it was conceived, **Evernote** pioneered the recipe that now serves as the foundation of the featuredevelopment in today’s notetaking and journaling applications, as evidenced by CEO Phil Libin’s unapologeticuse of the term “[life-logging](https://techcrunch.com/2009/12/30/evernote-two-million/)” in 2009, whichsounds bizarre in retrospect because we’re now well-accustomed to easily “snapping geotagged photos”(smartphones had always included location data in their photo files’ meta, but Evernote was the first app togive a user access to the data *on their device*,) “making voice notes,” or and organizing text notes viaadvanced categorization and metadata-enabled searchability. These features are essentials in the apps youcould accurately describe as “life-loggers” available for download now. Snapchat’s “Memories” especiallycome to mind, and I’ve long argued that we should [blame (or praise) Evernote for beginning the era ofeternal memory](http://bit.ly/redevernote). 
The iPhone OS app’s design would even influence Apple’s own [additions to its native photo and noteapplications in iOS7](https://www.theverge.com/2013/9/18/4741724/ios-7-review), much further down theline. Its technical doctrine of on-device storage coupled with syncing via The Cloud would inspire both[Microsoft’s OneNote](https://www.pcmag.com/commentary/345839/evernotes-loss-is-onenotes-gain) and[Bloom’s gorgeous DayOne](https://www.theverge.com/2012/8/3/3212579/the-best-journal-app-day-one).There was even a “full-featured” [Linux-running offshoot called NeverNote](http://howardcodner.blogspot.com/2011/02/nevernote-is-full-featured-evernote-app.html). 
In contrast with Evernote’s relatively busy design, **DayOne** has been the [best-looking app of any kindon iOS for years](https://thesweetsetup.com/apps/the-very-best-journaling-logging-app/). It shipped withthe same sort of extensive categorization, but it’s only ever been available on iOS, Android, and OSX —probably because Windows simply doesn’t look good enough. Should you wish, it will add detailed metadatafrom the moment you begin each journal entry including precise-ish GPS coordinates, an overview of your location’s weather at the time, *whether or not you were moving*, what song you were listening to, andyour step count for the day (now from the Health app.) You have the option of viewing your journalchronologically, by location on a map, or in a social-esque activity feed, and yes — its search function can befiltered by any of these datapoints. 
![Day One](https://i.snap.as/83yczp2.png) 
![Day One](https://i.snap.as/ZKsNUvr.png) 
In 2015, [Bloom added iCloud syncing](https://thesweetsetup.com/day-one-updated-with-new-sync-option/)and multiple journals, further closing the functionality gap between the two apps on paper, yet plenty ofusers continue to tether between the two using IFTTT (including myself for all my Twitter favorites, just tocompare.) Within the somewhat forgotten niche of the “life-logging” utility, DayOne is superior and serveswell the self-obsessed user who find the little details of their life to be *extremely interesting.* Last Spring,[they introduced](https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2017/4/25/15426678/day-one-book-print­journal) the option to purchase a stylized physical book of a user’s journal from within the app. As it iscurrently priced, the 2,674-page book I previewed today containing every single Tweet I’ve favorited in thepast 5 years displayed in a delicately-formatted layout would set me back over $365, and would have to besplit into 5 separate books (as per the maximum of 400 pages each.) Since I find my life *very* interesting,I’ve made a note to myself to proceed if/when I ever have that sort of money to throw around. 
For the **67.7%** of you who use digital notetaking or word processing software when you “**want toremember something**,” DayOne is the best option available because of its search function and satisfaction­of-use. Though Evernote was once the only app that could “[handle everything everything in your head](https://www.theverge.com/2014/9/4/6103843/best-note-taking-app-iphone),” it’s a different experienceentirely — tailored for work applications, if anything, since DayOne’s growth spurt. The company, itselfhasn’t exactly been managed cleanly, either with [layouts in 2015](https://www.theverge.com/2015/9/29/9420031/evernote-layoffs-office-closures) and [a privacy scandal in2016](https://www.theverge.com/2016/12/16/13979778/evernote-privacy-policy-opt-out), but then again,what billion-dollar company doesn’t have its controversies? 
Despite having imported my huge catalog of Evernote entries into DayOne, the former often gets stuck, andit’s retained the most irritating habit of all the software mentioned in this column. Because synced entries inEvernote are not live-updated like those in Google Docs or Dropbox Paper, it’s possible to modify or add to anote on one device while it’s open (and static) on another, which is addressed by either duplicating the mostrecent entry and filing it in the default “Conflicting Changes” folder, or pasting the duplicate of the entirecontents above the “old” content in the note, separated by a horizontal line. I’ve yet to figure out thebehavior that triggers which fix, but I don’t particularly care — I’ve decided to restrict my Evernote use tomy desktop, absolutely. If I haven’t articulated it well enough for you to form a visual, just trust me: **it’svery, very annoying**, and it should’ve been addressed years ago. 
It was my stepfather who told me about Evernote and signed me up for that beta. Both of us were then thesort of people who experienced extreme satisfaction in archiving and categorizing stuff (which is probablythe most straightforward way to define *nerd*,) but he was especially and absolutely enthralled with its[Web Clipper function](https://blog.evernote.com/blog/2008/06/26/web-clipping/), which allowed the userto save webpages with “context” — both the metadata (source URL, date) and contents in “the text, images,and links” via their Firefox extension, which was revolutionary from our perspective, and certainly beat thehell out of stuffed, ugly bookmark folders or printed-to-pdfs. However, Web 2.0 was a younger, then and[significantly more lithe](http://www.websiteoptimization.com/speed/tweak/average-web-page/) — theaverage web page is now *10 times larger* (disclosure: [“average web page” is a somewhat misleadingterm](https://www.igvita.com/2016/01/12/the-average-page-is-a-myth/), though I think we can probablyagree that it’s *too fucking big*, regardless,) and it’s long past time for us to accept that this technology isno longer a reasonable solution to saved images. 
![Evernote Web Clipper](https://i.snap.as/eKdKSyd.png) 
Though development on the Web Clipper appears to have continued — it’s now on Version 7.something — the vast majority of the pages you’d want to save on the web ([except for Linkedin, apparently](https://twitter.com/FickleCrux/status/1001763470902099968),) show Evernote’s age as it attempts to clipthem — often taking *several minutes* to yield the product, which is *always* broken as hell. Don’t take myword for it, though: another one of Evernote’s less-discussed features *technically* makes it a publishingplatform because I can share a note from my account with you, the world, via [this public link](http://www.evernote.com/l/ACT8YDUZovlFS6iWaPOsGpW9uVFqlXkt2YQ/). It’s a clip I took a year ago of[*Wired*’s profile of Jad Abumrad](https://www.wired.com/2014/02/myspace_jad/), and you’ll notice that itisn’t *completely* unreadable, but it *is* ugly and broken. Even after [last year’s update](https://techcrunch.com/2017/01/17/evernote-attempts-to-simplify-with-its-new-ios-app/), it’s still clumsy,slow, and virtually unusable without a stellar data connection. 
**Archive obsessives**, I know that Evernote could have become part of *your system* and over time, youmay have built a gargantuan library within it — the perfection of your tagging system’s efficiency and yourcategorical format’s consistency making it such a treasure that you might think of it in times of duress tocalm yourself. I’ve allowed myself to continue using it *exclusively* for notes in my novel project, so I dounderstand that it may represent tens of thousands of hours of your time and that losing it would cause youtremendous grief, *but*… **it’s time to let go** and better your life by exploring the selection ofalternatives and their superior capabilities. 
![Google Keep](https://i.snap.as/Tl62RVD.png) 
As you’d expect, software has changed a lot [since 2010](https://lifehacker.com/5590027/five-best-mobile­note-taking-tools), and the choices available for word processing are now abundant and relatively diverse. Asfor web clipping, in particular, I would suggest your new browser Vivaldi and its super capable [full-pagecapture feature](https://vivaldi.com/blog/seize-the-moment-with-vivaldi-1-7/), which I’ve used for everythingfrom snapping a [25.1 MB, 30,000 pixel-high PNG capture of all Extranet data in text form](http://extratone.com/media/alltratodata.png) to the [photo specimens we submitted to Fonts in Use](http://bit.ly/extrfonts), to [crisp snips of full words](https://twitter.com/FickleCrux/status/969833640598306817). For comparison, [here’s what it captured](http://extratone.com/media/jadwired.png) of that old *Wired* post on Jad. You’ll notice that while theimage is relatively large, none of the article itself has been lost (aside from the featured image, on *Wired*’send,) and the resolution is fine enough that you could still crop out quotes or smaller shots to share if youdiscovered something later. This ability of Vivaldi’s still feels like magic to me, and there are plenty of otherreasons to use the browser, but I’ll save that discussion for a later date. 
I could cite plenty of pseudoidealistic reasons to *never* use Google Chrome, Google Docs, Google Keep, orany other Google product, really, mostly because they all look like shit, [their browser is swallowing theinternet](https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/4/16805216/google-chrome-only-sites-internet-explorer-6-web­standards), (along with their “[accelerated mobile pages](https://www.theverge.com/2018/2/13/17006006/google-amp-stories-google-search-slideshows)” project,)
and just about everything the company was built on — along with [what they plan for the future](https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/17/17365362/google-chrome-secure-indicator-https) — is completely
(and sometimes even [explicitly](https://gizmodo.com/google-removes-nearly-all-mentions-of-dont-be-evil­from-1826153393)) opposed to The Open Web, good design, and [humanity as a whole](http://bit.ly/googlechurch). However, I fully realize that idealism doesn’t mean shit when you’re just tryingto get the job done, so let’s talk about Keep and Docs. 
**Google Keep** is part notetaking service and part streamlined, modernized, hassle-free execution ofEvernote’s Web Clipper. If you’re already using Chrome or you’re desperate enough for the ability to clip webpages without switching windows for whatever reason that you’d change your browsing habits entirely, you
can add its extension to the top task bar — right next to Evernote’s — and use it any time you feel that old
archivist itch. The extension will very quickly and smoothly clip the title and URL, along with whatever ofyour own text/tags you feel like using, but it will *not* attempt to capture any of the web page’s content(Google already has it somewhere, anyway.) 
![Optical Character Recognition](https://i.snap.as/Uw8kvMU.png) 
Like all of its kin, Google Keep is particularly [savvy with integration](https://www.computerworld.com/article/3026239/android/google-keep-3-years.html): you can immediatelysend your clip to a Google Doc, set a reminder, add a collaborator and even *draw* on any entry. Its partypiece in this Tactile Era of touch-enabled laptops and keyboard-equipped tablets is its ability to digitizehandwriting or “grab image text,” a novelty technology called Optical Character Recognition, which has been[tickling our most stale fantasies for centuries](http://history-computer.com/ModernComputer/Basis/OCR.html), now. Though I’m sure it’s genuinely appreciated in ahandful of especially quaint use cases, somewhere in the world, there’s never going to be an at-scaleapplication for this sort of thing. I know my handwriting is bad, but if [Keep can’t “grab” it reliably](http://bit.ly/keephand), there’s not much sense in using it at all for me, though Google’s Academy forYoung Algorithms will certainly make sure to save every one of my motions to capitalize on *my* time (oryours.) 
**Microsoft OneNote** is as clunky, busy, and buggy as Google Keep is quick and uninspiring, but that’sprobably because it’s much *much* older than I remember. To demonstrate its web clipping function, Iclipped the [OneNote portion](https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,1273091,00.asp) of [*PCMagazine*’sMicrosoft Office 2003 review](https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,1273084,00.asp) and exported it intoa [PDF](http://extratone.com/library/onenote-pcmag.pdf), which isn’t a straightforward process, but is ituseful? No. Because it’s a PDF, it’s almost unreadably low-resolution, yet manages to weigh 1.2 MB. My(cropped) [Vivaldi capture of the same page](http://extratone.com/media/onenote2003.png) is 988 kB andnearly impossible to tell apart from the live experience, so why are we bothering with OneNote at all? Well,according to [Preston Gralla for *ComputerWorld*](https://www.computerworld.com/article/2488890/enterprise-applications/desktop-apps-onenote-vs­evernote-a-personal-take-on-two-great-note-taking-apps.html) (the last tech site still publishing worthwhilesoftware reviews): 
> It bristles with note-creation tools for drawing, recording audio and video, scanning images, embeddingspreadsheets and reviewing the edits of others (although the abilities of those tools differ somewhatdepending on the platform). In fact, its note-creation tools are more comprehensive than Evernote’s. 
And we begin to see OneNote’s place as the feature-heavyweight of synced notetaking applications. 
> The organization-minded will appreciate OneNote’s basic structure. You create individual notebooks; withineach notebook, you can create section groups that contain multiple sections. Each section has individualpages, with each page a separate note. It’s ideal for organizing content with a logical structure. 
Then again, dearest Preston goes on to express his adoration for Evernote Web Clipping shortly afterwardsand he did so just last year, so I won’t really claim to know what’s going on with him (he’s a legacy techjourno.) In my experience with twenty-somethings and younger, the more committed an artist or writer is totheir craft, the less interested they are in its tools, but it’s the young ones who need great tools the mostbefore they’re able to settle on and pin down their process. There was only **a single writer** (**3.2%**)surveyed who answered “**when I want to DIGITALLY record something to remember, I use…**” with“**the ‘compose’ function (to publish immediately and/or save for later as a draft) of a web-based textsharing service (Twitter, Tumblr, Medium, WordPress, Facebook, etc.)**,” and **one other** answered“**another text-entry field on my device where it will be saved for later**,” which **four users**(**13.3%**) said they use to “Brainstorm” digitally. 
By Question Set 3, the two alternative answers were dropped and for “Outlining” digitally, **45.2%** ofsurveyees use legacy word processors, **35.5%** use **cloud-based notetaking apps**, and **19.4%**use **the default notetaking program installed on their device**. In omitting alternative options earlier andincluding web-native CMS editors later, I inevitably shepherded answers within a moderately-wide berth ofwhere my own assumptions would lead their process. It’s interesting that for the last prompt, “**to makethe last modifications to my final draft, I…**” a whole **35.5%** reported they would still be using a**cloud-based service** instead of a **legacy word processor** (**58.1%**) or **CMS editor**(**6.5%**), which would suggest that the functionality of these new e-enabled methods of composition hasbecome truly important, indeed. 
Though it’s not necessarily unreasonable, it astounds me to consider how many Online users actuallycompose original drafts of *huge* works exclusively within publishing and blogging services like**Medium**, **Tumblr**, or **Reddit**, even. We currently cohabitate a literary sphere with [impossiblymassive works of fanfiction](https://kotaku.com/this-smash-bros-fan-fiction-has-3-5-million-words-s­899629991) that far surpass anything God or The Classics established in the past, and it’s a wonder howmany [sour habits](http://bit.ly/redvonnegut) have crept into the writing world as a result. For the sake ofthe experiment (and [my own education](http://bit.ly/futureland9),) I posted some of my recent work on[**Medium**](https://medium.com/@ficklecrux) and found its composition UI much improved from what Iremember and comparable in many ways to those of more recent dedicated document editing/notetakingservices, but there’s still whole set of abstract, less-than-technical reasons not to *publish* on Medium,much less compose there. 
Briefly: instead of “[defining a new model for media on the internet](https://blog.medium.com/renewing­mediums-focus-98f374a960be),” CEO Ev Williams and company ended up creating an isolationist communitywith [hellishly-skewed priorities in craft](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/how-to-write-medium-stories­people-will-actually-read-92e58a27c8d8). Virtually all of what’s actually *born* on Medium is of a certainsoulsucking, less-than-productive quality (notable exceptions include [Ryan Dell](https://medium.com/@ryandeel), [Dave Pell](https://medium.com/@davepell), and work from marginalizedvoices that would not otherwise be written or published.) Though their founding principles of ad-modeldisruption are redeemable and entirely sincere, I’m sure, their result doesn’t actually solve anything at all,especially after [last year’s layoffs and refocus](https://www.recode.net/2017/1/4/14169348/medium­layoffs-ad-business-model-change). 
As for **Tumblr** and **Reddit**, I’m afraid I’ve never been capable of truly understanding either, but Idid blog extensively about cars for the first time 5–6 years ago on the former when it was one of significantlyfewer fee-free options for digital publishing, and even then the experience was already casting doubt on the
true necessity and existence of blogging platforms like WordPress — especially for web development-
abhorring peons like I was at the time. Now, its iOS app is gorgeous, and its editor has ended up rock-solidand surprisingly versatile, yet the state of its community, also, leaves one with little reason to publish asidefrom a sortof isolationist desire to contribute to *the community itself*, for Tumblr’s sake. 
This is where **WordPress** should outshine everything else as a pure, open-source Content ManagementSystem for any and every use by any and every folk with server space, so I thought I’d try out [my ownfresh, ultra-connected install](http://extratone.com/shife) to see how its experience has changed. In wordprocessing terms, its [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/wordpress/id335703880) and [Windows](https://apps.wordpress.com/d/windows/) clients are *lightyears* ahead of where they were a few yearsago, but to take full advantage of them, one must allow WordPress’ own software access that’s [not *OpenWeb* at all](https://www.wpexplorer.com/jetpack-wordpress-plugin/). For light, minimalist personal blogs, aWordPress site offers much more control over one’s intellectual property than Medium or Tumblr, but it’salso significantly less independent than it once was. A quick inspection of my little experiment reveals that 5out of its 6 content sources are from Google or WordPress properties, leaving only one for *my* actualserver. This means I can accomplish a lot using just their apps, and my work will be distributed among“billions of posts” across WordPress dot com (to be found by absolutely nobody, I suspect,) but the posteditor within the CMS itself has never functioned quite so versatility as it does right now. And yet, neitherWordPress nor any of the software I’ve covered thus far achieve much progress toward an ideal,comprehensive word processing solution. 
![Dropbox Paper](https://i.snap.as/wDQtaPk.png) 
That’s why I’d like to talk about **Dropbox Paper**, which has been my own browser’s homepage andprimary text editor since [its public beta went live](https://www.theverge.com/2016/8/4/12373696/dropbox­paper-ios-android-sharing-docs) in August of 2016, and it’s very hard not to dote on considering that it isdefinitively the single most useful software addition in my whole computing life. It’s a live-updatingexclusively web-based (for now) service with an emphasis on collaboration, just like the industry-standardmonstrosity that is **Google Docs**, but it’s been designed from the ground-up to perform best theoperations you need most from a word processor in 2018, which doesn’t include advanced layouts, fine-adjustable paragraph and/or letter spacing, Excel integration, or voice dictation, but simply… typing and re­reading and editing. You’d be surprised what a handy productivity catalyst can become of a simple white,live-updating space without distraction available no matter where you are or what device you’re in reach of. 
Virtually *all* of my “process” is now conducted within Paper, and I’ve never before experienced such anunconscious assimilation of use. I write about software because I’ve used a lot of it and I’ve been able to count on my ability to find fundamental mistakes/designed ignorance in most everything. Dropbox Paper,however, is so keenly perfect for my own needs that I slipped unconsciously into total, daily dependenceupon it without noticing the transition at all, which has never, *ever* happened before. Notes can beginfrom blank Text/Title fields to *Brainstorming*, *Meeting Notes*, and *Project Overview* templates. InApril, the team [introduced the ability](https://blogs.dropbox.com/dropbox/2018/04/dropbox-paper­templates/) to “templatize” any document, which I’ve yet to explore but will no doubt make full use of forshow notes when [*Futureland*](http://extratone.com/futureland) is revived. There are also [Evernotetemplates](https://blog.evernote.com/blog/2017/05/05/uncovering-templates-hidden-gem-evernote/), yes,but you cannot create your own, and downloading them is an unnecessary pain in the ass. 
![Dropbox Paper Search](https://i.snap.as/kn7b2Tx.png) 
Landing on the root, you’ll see Folders, Starred Folders, Starred Entries, and Shared Documents all displayedchronologically by modification date. Instead of tags, categories, or “notebooks,” Dropbox Paper’s folders areits singular method of categorization, and they are astoundingly sufficient, even when editing multiple
documents simultaneously or digging through professional and personal entries within a single account — all
thanks to its search function, which is super-swift and superior to any other service because of its profoundsimplicity. It’s one of many experiences which laughably shame past efforts in the design of these tools:without any customizable search filters or metadata and [by sifting only through title, content, and author](https://www.dropbox.com/help/paper/find-docs), any note in Paper can be found *instantly* no matterhow dated or obscure. I doubt I’ve yet to top 1000 entries quite yet (there’s no easy way to count, and *whyshould there be*, really,) but on several occasions I’ve found years-untouched, untitled documents within
seconds — a process which has *never* been brisk or convenient in Evernote. 
Though Dropbox Paper wasn’t necessarily designed for composing 5000+-word longform, it’s by far the best
tool for the vast majority of the pre-publishing process (to a reasonable extent, of course — I wouldn’t use it
for a screenplay or novel manuscript.) It’s rare for me to utilize its mastery of collaboration, these days, but
there’s frankly little reason to go anywhere else — including Google Docs — considering that Paper documents
can be bound by the same viewing and editing permissions: by individual entry or folder, marking livemodifications with clean, color-coded initials in the sidebar, by email or rogue URL for editing, commenting,and/or reading. (The comments interface is the best I’ve ever seen by a wide margin.) Users can beassigned and “pinged” for tasks using “@,” and it’s reasonable to assume that permissions won’t everpresent an issue for my own use considering they haven’t already. To a limited extent, notes can be easily“published” via shared links yet remain editable in realtime, making Paper perfect for obscure-but-publicreference documents like [our style guide](http://extratone.com/style) and [redirects catalog](http://extratone.com/redirection). 
From the onset of use, you’ll marvel at how fucking fast and smooth the in-browser experience is regardless
of your device’s age or dimensions. Surprise surprise — the iOS app works just as smoothly and is laid outvaguely like a Twitter client. “Browse” — the chronological timeline of documents — occupies the leftmostbottom button as “Home” — the main timeline — does in Twitter’s app, and “Notifications” is likewise the same
icon (practically) in the same position in both, and the items themselves are even grouped with rich card-looking content previews. Perhaps these nods to my Twitter muscle memory have contributed to my ownunusual bias, but I suspect it shares components with a particular demographic of professional writers. As Iunderstand the day-to-day activities of a feet-on-the-pavement reporter, Dropbox Paper is a necessity in aridiculously all-encompassing sense. With its Slack integration, [super high-usability design](https://blogs.dropbox.com/dropbox/2017/03/paper-hidden-gems/), collaborative modularity, ultra copy­and-paste-friendly text, smooth hyperlink behavior, light weight, and ultimate compatibility, it should beevangelized as a no-brainer option in journalism. *Fuck* a Bic & steno. 
Web Clipping may be completely alien to its vocabulary, but you can drag and drop documents in just aboutany format for a beautifully-embedded preview. Conveniently, [they won’t even count against your Dropbox upload quota](https://www.dropbox.com/help/paper/dropbox-integration): “Dropbox Paper doesn’t place alimit on the number of docs you can create, and includes unlimited version history regardless of the Dropboxplan you are on.” Naturally, this is subject to change in the future, but I’m 95% positive that Paper has yetto refuse any of my uploads because of their size or format, and many of mine are extraordinarily huge. 
There is a perfect power to Paper which I can only beg its stewards to leave unmolested for as long aspossible. If I was a billionaire, I’d immediately purchase it from Dropbox and leave everything to the
company — revenue, janitorial development, user data, etc. — except the right to make any significant feature
or functionality additions to the user experience, as I have never before felt this way about a single serviceor program… *ever*. I’m not sure if I should keep quiet or incessantly kiss ass, but my interest undoubtedlylies in preserving Paper as it is. If you’re left doubting my own testimonial, there are a billion throwaway“Ditch Google Docs for Dropbox Paper” posts across the B and C-list technosphere. [*Gizmodo’s*](https://www.gizmodo.com.au/2017/02/5-reasons-you-might-ditch-google-docs-for-dropbox-paper/), forinstance, notes Paper’s superior formatting freedom, intelligent footprint, incredible embed flexibility, and…independence from the terrible Google God. 
![Dropbox Paper iOS](https://i.snap.as/w1nbxBE.png) 
Right now, one’s choices in notetaking apps for iOS are almost *too* varied. There’s [**Zoho Notebook**](https://www.pcmag.com/review/346353/zoho-notebook-for-iphone), which claims itself to be “An App Store2016 Best App of the Year” (falsely, [it would appear](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2016/12/apple­unveils-best-of-2016-across-apps-music-movies-and-more/).) I recall installing it on my 6S Plus, then, afterspying some screenshots of its multicolored notes, but I failed to find room for its use. When the (completelyuseless) Files app was added with iOS 11, I played around with it for a bit and somehow ended up settingZoho as the default application to open PDFs which inadvertently launched my 8 Plus into an infinite loop of“Open __ in __?” prompts that eventually required deletion of Notebook in order to view them at all. I tendto especially adore these programs in their early, innocent versions when they smell most of innovationbefore their creators are inevitably brought back to our filthy reality when their VCs start expecting *money*.Zoho Notebook should have bewitched my affections, but my short trial was clunky and disastrous and those
beautifully-colored layouts weren’t quite worth the trouble, so they were missed — to no consequence at all. 
The latest favorite is **Bear**, the Markdown-supporting app with which *The Verge*’s Casey Newton[replaced Evernote for his own use](https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/2/14785264/evernote-replacement­bear-app), last year. His authority in writing copy at huge volume is notable if only for his [*daily newsletteron the business of social media*](https://www.getrevue.co/profile/caseynewton), which is alwaysunfathomably gargantuan and clean. 
> Bear lets you tag notes by adding a hashtag to a word anywhere in your document; you can add as manyas you like, and then browse them later from the left rail. You can export your notes as PDFs, rich text files,HTML documents, or even JPEGs. And it supports ultra-nerd automation, so if you use an iOS app likeWorkflow **[**[**now Shortcuts**](https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/4/17414648/siri-update-new­features-apple-wwdc-2018)**]** you can create shortcuts to your notes. 
DayOne’s own markdown support and exporting capabilities surely make it Bear’s predecessor. JPEG exportsare a nice touch and they reflect awareness of what power notetakers like Newton *actually do* with theirsoftware. If I had not already chosen to [depart OSX](http://bit.ly/spectreinred), long ago, I would seriouslyconsider downloading the app on both platforms and paying its monthly $15 membership fee to try outsyncing, but I suspect Google’s moderate but noticeable influence on their design would quickly prove to bea turn-off, personally. I had a go at Bear’s free iOS experience and saw little functional difference from
DayOne — if anything, text didn’t look quite as sharp — but its reported integration with Siri Shortcuts is
intriguing. ([Apple acquired Workflow last year](https://techcrunch.com/2017/03/22/apple-has-acquired­workflow-a-powerful-automation-tool-for-ipad-and-iphone/), absorbing it into its upcoming iOS 12 release as
Shortcuts.) I’d suggest you give it a try — especially if your desktop-class machine is a Mac — and for your
sake, I would hope they choose to utilize the power of the modern browser with a web interface in thefuture. “As a writer, I work in text, and text ought to be simple,” Newton opined, likely with more brevitythan I’m capable of in this discussion. 
Much of anything has yet to be written about these offerings in 2018, but I must insist both regular andintermittent writers alike give Dropbox Paper a try. I suspect you’ve less “privacy” to “lose” than you wouldin Google Docs, and its sublime function as a writing tool extends from workplace collaboration to sharedgrocery lists with your SO and long, image and hyperlink-saturated works like this one. It’s very difficult to
break — even by pasting fragmenting code or Zalgo text; it’s never out of date, and always a short, teeny
pageload away even across the worst of connections. As someone with an unhealthy obsession with hiswritten work, I can tell you that its UI is by far the most anxiety-relieving I’ve ever used. As an alternative toGoogle Docs, I would point out that 1) Docs supersedes Paper in sum features *significantly* less than you’d
think and 2) for the one or two weird formatting challenges it fails to complete, neither Microsoft Word — theold bitch — nor Docs are going anywhere, and Paper exports to both of them directly.

## The Future 
Curiously enough, I was required to use every single method of text retention of which I am capable in the
course of writing this piece, as I tripped over my laptop’s charging cable — a physical connection, yes (and
with substantial leverage) because Apple won’t allow other computer manufacturers to make use of “their”
ingenious magnetic charging solution which they’ve included as “MagSafe” on MacBooks since 2008 —
perhaps inevitably ruining the port and leaving me with only my iPhone and pens. I filled a few folded sheetsof paper with [my LAMY Safari](https://www.instagram.com/p/BgErFqhFvyT/) (which is good, butoverrated,) and felt quite ridiculous in the process. Thanks to my fiancé’s generosity, I type this bit now onher Panasonic R440 Electric Typewriter, which must still be considered a legitimate means of writing text in2018 if only because of [Instagram poetry](https://theoutline.com/post/2488/collin-andrew-yost-the-most­hated-poet-in-portland). According to [its rather dubious listing](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00005QT7B/ref=as_li_ss_tl) on Amazon, this model dates to September 4th,1973, which is remarkable considering its spellcheck and auto-margin functions (neither of which I couldactually figure out how to use.) If there is anywhere to be caught clacking away on a typewriter out ofpreference (I’d hesitate to call even my own situation one of *necessity*,) in 2018, it would undoubtedly bePortland, yet I am still extremely embarrassed to be the source of all this racket and would immediatelyperish if any of my neighbors bothered to track it down. 
Even this very sophisticated example of the typewriting species is limited by one’s supply of both ink anderasing ribbon, though either can still be found for sale, remarkably. I am even less able to easily correctmistakes than those I wrote by hand because I feel a significant pang of pain via my mechanical empathyevery time I use (or accidentally misuse) the function which whites out text with a sickening *clunk*. There’ssomething about this process which makes it feel more taxing, costly, and timeconsuming than any other,but perhaps with time and extended use, my embarrassment, empathy, and hesitance would fade and I’dbecome a cruel, loaded God of shitty prose, but I have no intention of finding out. I’ll willingly concede thatrestored or refurbished typewriters can be [absolutely gorgeous](https://twitter.com/FickleCrux/status/923340941129170944), and there’s probably some validity in the“distraction-free writing environment,” but I’d suggest that anyone who’s pounded out any significant chunkof copy knows that one must find a groove of absolute focus within a word processor in order to completework with any efficiency or cohesion, anyway. I’m as connected as any of you, yet these days, I always endup *hyperfocused* on Word, Dropbox Paper, and/or research in my browser to the exclusion of anythingelse on the machine, whether or not I intend to do so. I’m no authority, but I can’t see a functional place fora typewriter in 2018. 
Portlanders, surely, are vain enough to avoid leaving such disastrous drafts laying about, though now’s agood time to note that one can now scan their typewritten document into a word processor using nativesoftware on their smartphone, nowadays, if they’re so unreasonably inclined. Using iOS default Notes app, Icould scan this physical draft into Portable Document Format with just a few steps, but doing so wouldcontribute to the ridiculous perception that Adobe’s ancient, clunky standard is the ultimate end of the linefor any and all digital publishing. Yes, it’s ridiculous to consider “25 years” of development led to PDF 2.0’srelease *just last year*, to nobody’s glee outside [*The Fucking Adobe Blog*](https://theblog.adobe.com/taking-documents-to-the-next-level-with-pdf-2-0/) (which I do believe is runningon Medium, hilariously.) Yet throughout my existence, it’s been the go-to half-step between text’s digital and physical forms. The liason, if you will. 
Perhaps one could argue that this role in our collective academic Western word processing lives is profound(though no mentally functional human being wants to meet *them*,) which would inevitably lead them tocriticize Adobe’s longtime occupation of it, but to examine the *next* significant step in the development ofword processing is (this moment, at least) extremely hellish and alarming. This “[Virtual Reality prototype](https://youtu.be/LxviGskApcw),” for instance, surpasses even *The Soul Ledger* as the most distressingonline video of all time. 
Just **32.3%** of survey respondents claim they print “**at least one draft and use a pen or pencil tomake notes/mark corrections by hand**,” not including the additional **6.5%** who “**print at least onedraft but make all corrections digitally**,” leaving **61.3%** who presumably do not physically print at allthroughout their writing process. Our survey is broad, rudimentary, and not entirely scientific, yes, but Iwould bet these numbers would contrast significantly with those from respondents exclusively in academia.For myself and my colleagues, there remains “*something*” that can only be attained by physicallymanifesting written work, perhaps in requirement of tangible manipulation in order to thoroughlycomprehend large bodies of information. As I’ve passed 100,000 words within the rough draft of my novelproject, no amount of skimming on any sized screen has enabled me to catch the typos and inconsistencieswhich become *immediately* obvious as soon as I have the most current printed manuscript in my hands. Idoubt even total immersion into one’s work via some VR-capable word processor would do much to assuage
this discrepancy — or much at all, for that matter, aside from casting writers into their own special hell.
Surely, only the most self-loathing of them would voluntarily choose to be so dunked. (Read: drowned.)

# David Blue, Federated 
![Mastodon Tiles](https://i.snap.as/aFTNmNg.png) 
If you’ve been keeping up with the web at all in the past two years, you’re no doubt at least somewhatfamiliar with the terms “Mastodon,” “Diaspora,” or “federated social.” *Extratone* readers may remember[my interview with Eugen Rochko](http://www.extratone.com/tech/mastodon/) last April — the day whenhis federated social “clone” made its way around the front pages of the major technology and tech mediawebsites. Though the piece itself was designed and written quite disastrously (genuinely sorry about that —it was easy for me to get carried away when I had no idea what I was carrying,) Eugen is a greatcommunicator of his ideal, which you’ll find to be as aligned with a FOSS future as you’d think it would be. 
I signed up for [**mastodon.social**](http://mastodon.social) in the February of last year, yet I supposeyear sof o find myself going back to Twitter looking for what I only get on Mastodon, these days: diverse,sincere, talented, and extremely *curious* users from all over the world backed and deeply co-habitatedwith an inclusive developer culture filled with smart problem solvers who just want to contribute somethinggrand. It’s not exactly easy, yet instances and variations on the ActivityHub project, itself have begunspringing up at a pace I can’t keep up with. There’s the open-source federated blogging CMS [Plume](https://github.com/Plume-org/Plume), along with the gorgeous and *very* promising Instagram-esque[PixelFed](http://pixelfed.org).

# Finally Broke Windows 
![Broke Windows](https://i.snap.as/CF3xPXEF.jpg) 
## An attempt to fix a Windows Insider Build issue led to soft-bricking my Surface Laptop 2. 
I finally did it, ladies and gentlemen... I managed to break the Windows installation on my [Microsoft SurfaceLaptop 2](https://www.davidblue.wtf/t/surface/) to such an extent that it has been unrecoverable. I amcurrently borrowing my mother's MacBook Pro and waiting on a Windows 10 installation .ISO file todownload so that I can hope to mount it correctly on the last, shitty USB thumb drive I still have lyingaround. 
![Fuck Grammarly](https://i.snap.as/GG9y4pmC.png) 
*YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT BITCH.* 
I now suspect I began down this path a few months ago when I discovered [Windows Insider Channels](https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2020/06/15/introducing-windows-insider-channels/) andrejoiced... As I've discovered that one can relatively easily find a beta version of virtually _any_ piece ofsoftware, it's become a bit of a habit for me. More or less unconsciously, I’ve ended up with an applicationlibrary full of _Developer Beta_ and _Nightly_ _Build_\-type shit. I don't think there was/is a single webbrowser installed on that machine that is not the given entity's "Developer Edition" which - considering mostof the regular installs allow you to opt into dev tools, anyway - seem like they might be redundant. I don'tparticularly care, anymore - I mostly just love their icons. [Firefox Developer Edition](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/developer/)'s logo is a blue Firefox(!,) [Edge Chromium Dev](https://www.microsoftedgeinsider.com/en-us/download)'s is... more interesting than the regular version.[Google Chrome Canary](https://www.google.com/chrome/canary/)'s icon is a surprisingly-tasteful variationof the company's usually-horrendous color palette. 
What I'm trying to say is... I have continued upon this habit of opting for unstable versions of software in asort of defiance against the common sense notion that relying upon them is generally a _bad idea_.[^1] Isuppose I was just **waiting to experience any consequences** from such a decision, and well... Here theyare! 
It all began when my Surface's integrated webcam became invisible to all applications that used a videoinput - including Microsoft's own Camera app and OBS. It showed up in Device Manger, where I did thegenerally-recommended troubleshooting task of uninstalling it completely (including its drivers) andrebooting to force Windows to reinstall it. It did so successfully every time, to no effect on the original issue.I also went into the Surface's BIOS menu, where its hardware devices are explicitly listed, and disabled/re­enabled the camera, to no effect. Normally, the absence of a webcam function would be more or lessirrelevant to my day-to-day workflow, but now that [I'm partaking in "virtual" college courses](https://www.davidblue.wtf/college-return/), at least one of my professors has pressured me to appear _oncam_ as soon as possible. 
On Sunday night, I decided to revisit the problem with greater commitment, diving into a variety of deepertroubleshooting steps which I do not recall. The crucial one, though, was my decision to use the System FileChecker tool ``(sfc /scannow)`` with the added instruction to _fix_ whatever errors it found.[^2] This drovemy dearest little laptop into a cycle of self-diagnoses which results in an option screen including "Reset PC."After trying virtually every other option, I decided to try resetting, only to be met with connectivity errormessages after pursuing the "Install via Network" option, leaving the use of a bootable Windows 10 recoveryUSB as my only choice, in theory. 
Another problem now arose: my mother's MacBook Pro is the only other machine I have any sort of accessto at the moment, and MacOS no longer supports the creation of such a bootable USB for Windows via theBoot Camp Utility any longer. Nevertheless, I tried to make one by downloading the correct OS ISO andmounting it via UNetbootin, which didn't work. I then called [Columbia Computer Center] (https://www.colcomputers.com/), who very generously agreed to make one for me and only charge me forthe drive itself ($10!) 
Unfortunately, that one hasn't worked either, so I'm afraid I'm just going to have to take the thing to them...[Stay tuned](https://www.davidblue.wtf/t/surface/) for the Final Verdict. 
[1] This is why I’ve always downloaded the developer iOS beta releases on my actual, daily driver handset.

# Google Is Not God of The Web 
![Gurgle Crum Tile](https://i.snap.as/sA0Npx6.png) 
Almost exactly two years ago, [I warned that Google was on track to replace God](https://bilge.world/google-soul­ledger-dont-be-evil) of us all. Last month, *The Verge*'s Dieter Bohn reported that [Google plans to begin accounting for "page experience" in its search rankings](https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/28/21272543/google-search-results­page-experience-load-time-contentfu-paint-layout-shift-top-stories-amp) beginning in 2021, later explaining in a [subsequent episode of *The Vergecast*](https://www.theverge.com/21274502/vergecast-podcast-407-trump-executive­order-social-media-hbo-max-launch): 
> Here is another example of the Chrome team coming up with a bunch of web standards and then the Search team making a bunch of incentives based on those standards. 
It was news to me that in May, Google [launched](https://blog.chromium.org/2020/05/introducing-web-vitals-essential­metrics.html) a page called "Web Vitals" on its [**web.dev**](https://web.dev/vitals/) domain (which they've [apparently owned since November 2018](http://web.archive.org/web/20180415000000*/web.dev).) The company measures "page experience" based on three main criteria: 
> - [**Largest Contentful Paint**](https://web.dev/lcp/) measures perceived load speed and marks the point in the page load timeline when the page's main content has likely loaded. > - [**First Input Delay**](https://web.dev/fid/) measures responsiveness and quantifies the experience users feel when trying to first interact with the page. > - [**Cumulative Layout Shift**](https://web.dev/cls/) measures visual stability and quantifies the amount of unexpected layout shift of visible page content. 
[CoStar](https://www.costarastrology.com/neoyokel) just sent an oddly topical (and honestly, encouraging) notification: 
![Costar Notification](https://i.snap.as/1Lo8JrN.jpeg) 
I'm not a "real" web developer - nor do I mean to dictate to a single one - but I know enough theory to note that of this "core web" education operation centered around web.dev is operating on some irritating assumptions: 
### 1. Smaller assets are ideal. 
The simple assumption that it is always better to have the smallest page possible - that images should be resized and compressed to hell and typography/other elements should be few in number. Instantaneous page loads should be priority over any other standards of measure for a web page - like interesting design, for instance. 
### 2. Minimalistic design is necessary. 
The reality - for most of the Western world, at least - is that [average network speeds are exponentially increasing] (https://www.forbes.com/sites/kevinmurnane/2018/12/11/heres-how-internet-speeds-fared-for-the-worlds-fastest-and­largest-countries-in-2018/#3f3124664976) year-by-year. In 2018: 
> World-wide average mobile download speed was 22.82 Mbps (Megabits per second), an increase of 15.2% over 2017. Average upload speed was 9.19 Mbps, an increase of 11.6%. Fixed broadband speeds also increased. Average download speed increased 26.4% to 46.12 Mbps, while average upload speed came in at 22.44 Mbps, a 26.5% increase. 
I may be a yokel, but these averages are still absolutely *inconceivable* to me. Our phones have as much RAM as my "studio" work desktop, now. 22.82 Mbps will reliably download *very* complex web pages nearly instantaneously. There is a very reasonable argument for essential services like search engines and news websites to conform to/adopt standards like AMP, but for the rest of The Open Web, ingenuity and risktaking should be *encouraged*, not 
discouraged, for the true good of all Peoplekind. 
A term I haven't seen for a good while describes this ideology: "the **mobile web**," and it completely sucking ass is not a new concept. I've before referenced [an old complaint](https://www.theverge.com/2015/7/20/9002721/the-mobile­web-sucks) from 2015 by *The Verge*'s Editor-in-Chief, Nilay Patel (which the original article also links in different context in its last line): 
> The entire point of the web was to democratize and simplify publishing using standards that anyone could build on, and it has been a raging, massively disruptive success for decades now. But the iPhone's depressing combination of [dominant mobile web marketshare](https://www.netmarketshare.com/browser-market-share.aspx? qprid=0&qpcustomd=1) and shitbox performance means we're all sort of ready to throw that progress away. 
### 3. Google has the right to dictate "Best Practices." 
The Mobile Web as a utility has its place, but it's certainly not a necessary or desirable ideal for the entirety of The Web, yet Google has the audacity to presume it can dictate what is and is not optimal web design. The URL in and of itself is extremely presumptuous - Google technically has every right to own web.dev, sure, but *should* it? The Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMP) program has already had an annoying effect on day-to-day browsing. I despise AMP links more than most things in life, just as I despise the name of the website *Search Engine Land* (which sounds like actual hell) who [also reported on this](https://searchengineland.com/the-google-page-experience-update-user-experience-to­become-a-google-ranking-factor-335252): 
> If you have AMP, the good news is that the majority of AMP pages do extremely well in terms of page experience metrics, [Google Project Manager] Rudy Galfi said. It doesnâ€™t mean that all AMP pages will have top page experience metrics, but AMP is built in a way to help with this. 
Recently, I discovered an incredibly refreshing/affirming essay wrapped in a hand-build web experience called " [Rediscovering the Small Web](https://neustadt.fr/essays/the-small-web/)" by designer [Parimal Satyal] (https://twitter.com/parimalsatyal), arguing for a different variety of Web presence: 
> Modern web design principles are very rarely directed at regular people looking to make a website on something they are interested in. Instead, the focus is on creating websites that perform well: > *Don't use too many colours. Write short, catchy headlines. Don't let content be too long. Optimise for SEO. Produce video content, attention span is decreasing. Have a an obvious call to action. Push your newsletter. Keep important information above the fold. Don't make users think. Follow conventions.* 
I realize that the majority of Web utilization cannot "revert" to hand-coded plain HTML web pages hosted on Neocities, but there's something to be learned (or remembered, in my case) from Satyal's argument: **The Web's forgotten strength is <u>diversity</u>** (much like my country's, it would seem,) and the majority of users are being pushed by Google's search engine toward a very specific minority of URLs. We have not been *exploring* for a very long time: 
> Instead of browsing, the web is for many an endless and often overwhelming stream of content and commentary picked out by algorithms based on what they think you already like and will engage with. It's the opposite of exploration. 
"It is worth remembering a website does not have to be a product; it can also be art," argues Satyal. "The web is also a creative and cultural space that **need not confine itself to the conventions defined by commercial product design and marketing**." (Emphasis mine.) It's not just that The Web was *meant* to be more - nostalgia is definitely not my particular trip, if you didn't know - it's that it *can* be so much more. My [list of favorite Open Web projects] (https://bilge.world/open) contains just a few examples of what I mean. 
It's possible I am being *too* critical of Google. A [Twitter search](https://twitter.com/search? q=%22https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2020%2F5%2F28%2F21272543%2Fgoogle-search-results-page­experience-load-time-contentfu-paint-layout-shift-top-stories-amp%22&f=live) for the link to *The Verge*'s article reveals commentary like "[Experience, matters ;)](https://twitter.com/carlosriverao/status/1266051773472608257)," " [Web search moving forward](https://twitter.com/markupgrade/status/1266492831218139137)," and "[Halleluja!] (https://twitter.com/reDDakteur/status/1266078587767177219)," so there are clearly users who are more than onboard, and not all of what Google has done for the web recently has been detrimental. It was also announced last month that [Chrome will begin blocking "resource-heavy" advertisements](https://blog.chromium.org/2020/05/resource-heavy-ads­in-chrome.html) by default and that [Google and Microsoft have been working together to improve spellcheck and scrolling in Chromium](https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/28/21273934/microsoft-google-chrome-edge-chromium­spellcheck-improvements). There's not much to feel about these announcements, but - as always - there is a whole lot to feel about Google as a company. 
Google has [announced](https://dev.to/chromiumdev/announcing-web-dev-live-a-three-day-digital-event-2640) a three-day live digital event at the end of this month (June 30th-July 2nd) in which viewers will "celebrate our community's actions, learn modern web techniques and connect with each other." "Over three days, we'll share quick tips on aspects of modern web development," explains the company on its [web.dev/live page](https://web.dev/live/). I am planning to attend and bitch as much as I am allowed. [Stay tuned](https://bilge.world/subscribe) to hear a chronicle.

# Google Will Soon Replace God and The Church 
![Googleplex](https://i.snap.as/tCRNZM7.jpg) 
## What I have long predicted is now coming to pass: Google believes it should assume control. 
Out of all the technology companies that have made my knees knock and my voice hoarse and my [Tweetsmanic](http://bit.ly/bluegoogle) as a technoheretic in the past several years, Jumbo Google would easily takehome the winning trophy for Dystopian of the Millennium. I have been rehearsing an especially dear petprophecy of mine, unsolicited, to family, friends, and podcast guests since 2011 in which I end up arguingquite convincingly that Google is a dead ringer for the 16th-century Vatican: an inherently self-isolatingorganization with an absolute monopoly yielding *gargantuan* levels of essentially passive income from aservice which nearly everybody transacts with, but only Google understands (and is therefore assumed to beits only possible provider,) which inevitably develops such a distance from the rest of the populace and theirway of life (in tandem with total notoriety and celebrity among them all) not intentionally out of malice, butfrom the delusion of mythically-bestowed philanthropic duty that is borned of and compounded by thiseconomic and cultural isolation in a perpetual accumulation of power and wealth that radicalizes themonopolizers — the majority already highly predisposed to zeal as they would’ve needed to be in order tofind themselves in this singular, universally powerful position over every other class — and leaves theiregocentric minds to wander exempt from all criticism save for that of fellow radicalized monopolizers, whotogether begin to feel more and more comfortable wondering aloud about themselves in increasinglyfantastic presumptions: *what if all of this was bestowed upon us because we are superior to them? What ifit is our* **divine responsibility** *as superior beings to take charge and shepherd the common people asour sheep — for they cannot possibly know as well as we what is truly best for them?* 
You see it, right? And you can feel a very specific flavor of terror that is both awed by the scale of thecircumstances created by so few human minds and sincerely amused by the absoluteness of your owninability to alter them in any way. Perhaps you even recognize this taste as one perfected by Christianity’sancient advertising business, but Google knows so much about you that it’s rumored to’ve been selling userdata *to* the Judeochristian God for some time now at a 10% discount, and so we extrapolate andanticipate, yes? 
Of course, it’s admittedly satisfying for me to deliver you to this godfearing place in the most perverse *lookwhat I saw first that you didn’t see because you’re just not as bright but lucky for you, I’m so fuckinggenerous with my wisdom* sort of thinking around which the entire personas and livelihoods of fringemovement fanatics are built upon, but this is my *one* thing, okay? I’ve been waiting years for the righttime to formally argue this theory in depth, and — thanks to this year’s public spotlight finally pivoting on thegiants who’ve been silently swallowing their competition and relentlessly forcing their already ridiculousmargins higher and higher in relative obscurity for decades, the time has come, indeed. The commonpeople’s trust in Google had a godawful week. 
## Don’t Be Evil 
On Monday, [*Gizmodo*](https://gizmodo.com/google-employees-resign-in-protest-against-pentagon-con­1825729300)[ reported](https://gizmodo.com/google-employees-resign-in-protest-against-pentagon-con­1825729300) that twelve frustrated Google employees were quitting the company in protest of their workassisting the Department of Defense to “implement machine learning to classify images gathered by drones”for the detail fleeting Project Maven, despite some [4000 employee signatures](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/04/technology/google-letter-ceo-pentagon-project.html) on a [letter](http://extratone.com/library/dearsundar.pdf) addressed to CEO Sundar Pichai requesting (in full) that he“cancel this project immediately,” and “draft, publicize, and enforce a clear policy stating that neither Googlenor its contractors will ever build warfare technology,” citing the infamous “Don’t Be Evil” motto, whichGoogle [**then proceeded to remove**](https://gizmodo.com/google-removes-nearly-all-mentions-of-dont­be-evil-from-1826153393) from its [code of conduct](https://web.archive.org/web/20180504211806/https://abc.xyz/investor/other/google-code-of-conduct.html)for the first time in 18 years **the day after** the *New York Times* article went to press, on April 5th. 
On initial approach to the abstract of this story, from the ass to our thoughts arrives an easy narrative of aSilicon Valley mutiny comprised of twelve brave, conscientious souls who’ve been eaten up inside by theircomplicity in the filthy deals made by their power-obsessed CEO over scotch and cigars in a dark D.C. study
— kept awake for months by the sound of his puffing cackles at satellite images of dead toddlers in abombed-out street. 
*Ah ha*, we say. *That man is no good, and he just wouldn’t listen! They knew they didn’t have a choice…They only did what they had to do…* 
The reality of internal disagreements at Google, though, manages to be even more theatrical. The sheervolume of correspondence must surely be beyond anything capable of the enduser’s imagination, so let’sphone a friend: my favorite peek into the day-to-days of inter-Google existence is an [old blog post](http://bentilly.blogspot.com/2010/01/things-ive-learned-at-google.html) by [Benjamin Tilly](https://twitter.com/btilly) on his first month at the company in which he was compelled almost immediatelyto describe in great detail how best to “deal with a lot of email in gmail” at peak efficiency using shortcutsand labels. “As you get email, you need to be aggressive about deciding what you need to see, versus what is contextspecific.” 
Now we have a bit better idea of the *aggressive emailing* that was a sure constant on a normal workday atGoogle in 2010, so it must’ve been deafening after 8 years of Gmail development as 4000 employees nodoubt vented, debated, and decided to organize last month, though without making much headway becausethe leadership’s response was apparently “complicated by the fact that Google claims it is only providingopen-source software to Project Maven,” this new knowledge having *significant* effect on our mind’s imageof Sundar Pichai’s activities in Washington: he is now swapping seats with a frustrated Colin Powell in orderto install OpenOffice onto his desktop from a flash drive, and we recall that Google’s Googleplexheadquarters resembles nowhere in modern life more than a brand new playground built in a designlanguage borrowing heavily from *Spy Kids*. And though these Twelve disciples are unnamed for themoment, a few of them could immediately land book deals by going public, and every single one wouldalways have by default not only the badge of “I landed a job at Google,” (which is really to say *I have hitLife’s maximum level cap*,) but “I worked at Google for a while, but ended up quitting to do somethingelse,” which is guaranteed to make you the most interesting, intellectually superior person present in*whatever* crowd for the rest of your life. The ultra-cool [Sarah Cooper](https://twitter.com/sarahcpr) quitGoogle to become a comedian and even [got to talk to Kara Swisher](https://www.recode.net/2018/1/10/16871786/sarah-cooper-comedian-google-dick-costolo-kara-swisher­recode-decode-podcast)!I won’t pretend to understand big tech’s diminutive bastardization of prestige, but “more than 90 academics”jumping to publish an [open letter](https://www.icrac.net/open-letter-in-support-of-google-employees-and­tech-workers/) (adjacent to a huge *DONATE: Support the Campaign to Stop Killer Robots* button) in whichthey “write in solidarity with the 3100+ Google employees” who’s terrible boss decided to help some lackeysin the Pentagon set up their email and didn’t text back for a whole hour doesn’t sound 100% sincere.Notably, I don’t know how *or why* the fuck 90 people would go about collaborating on a single document,but if it really was managed, they definitely used Google Docs…At one point, it was fun to think about the history of the friendly side-scroller-playing garage ghouls anddorm dorks who gave *cooky*, *wacko* names to their dot com startups in parody and defiance of thelame-ass surname anagrams on the buildings of their established competitors, but those who’ve stuckaround have only done so by becoming expert at SUCKING UP EVERYTHING around them, and it pisses meoff every day how worried I am that my species will finally be done in by a company with a name like Yahoo!and be known only to a bunch of adolescent interdimensional silicon blobs 30 million years in the future as*that bipedal race who remained dignified until the last 0.01% of their reign on Earth, when in way less thana single generation, they all just went* **FUCKING INSANE** *and blew themselves up because theysuddenly hated all sense.* 
“Google” is perhaps the worst of these to have to shout in fear and/or anger in your last moments as itsounds in American English like you’ve startled your subject with a ticklish pinch followed so immediately byan esophagus-busting chokehold that the two events appear simultaneous, and in real English English, italmost always sounds like a parent speaking of a character on a pre-K children’s television programme whom they find quite foul and upsetting, but will manage to refrain from expressing so otherwise because theyknow that *Teletubbies* shit is the most quickly forgotten stage of television viewership. It’s fascinating howexclusive the word “Google” is to American English because in everything else it really *is* completenonsense, but lets halt all etymological discussions right now because we’ve only now just finished withMonday.

## The Soul Ledger 
On Thursday, all of my Google experiences, suppositions, and [soul-detaching screenshots](https://twitter.com/FickleCrux/status/914767928456749056) were usurped when a thoroughly alarminginternal company video called [*The Selfish Ledger*](https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/17/17344250/google-x-selfish-ledger-video-data-privacy) was leaked to*The Verge,* which I watched once then and do not want to watch again for the sake of this piece, but Iwill. Though the big V has been disappointingly timid for years about editorializing — when tech journalismdesperately needs some confident, informed opinion more than ever — Vlad Savov’s accompanying articleshould be read in its entirety, to which I can add my own terror where he perhaps could not.The production style is technically identical to that of the very popular thinkpiece-esque, motion-graphics­paired-with-obligatory-sharpie illustrated videos which you find playing at max volume on your mom’s iPadfrom where she’s fallen asleep on the couch at 9PM, but the repeating stock string soundtrack multipliesone’s discomfort as such that we would all end up in the fetal position without remembering the transitionwere it not for the appearance of trusty old Dank Jenkins, who’s face I thankfully associate heavily enoughwith [his infamous ](https://twitter.com/richarddawkins/status/389432783304548352)[*down-and-out*](https://twitter.com/richarddawkins/status/389432783304548352)[ Tweet](https://twitter.com/richarddawkins/status/389432783304548352) to be a welcome respite in attentionbefore the very scary hypothesis for which it’s been buttering me up, as best summed by Vlad: 
> The system would be able to “plug gaps in its knowledge and refine its model of human behavior” — notjust your particular behavior or mine, but that of the entire human species. “By thinking of user data asmultigenerational,” explains Foster, “it becomes possible for emerging users to benefit from the precedinggeneration’s behaviors and decisions.” Foster imagines mining the database of human behavior for patterns,“sequencing” it like the human genome, and making “increasingly accurate predictions about decisions andfuture behaviors.” 
The next time the *what if they do something scary* question comes up in a casual conversation aboutGoogle, you’ll have something a lot more substantial than just speculation. Or will you? *The Verge* reachedout for comment and got an awfully convenient response. 
> This is a thought-experiment by the Design team from years ago that uses a technique known as‘speculative design’ to explore uncomfortable ideas and concepts in order to provoke discussion and debate. 
Wow! Leave it up to grand ole Googe to reveal the ultimate excuse for just about any suggestion orbehavior, though it does seem almost *deliberately* uncomfortable, doesn’t it? No matter — whether or notthis video was ever about a project or tangible product development, or simply to *explore uncomfortableideas* because it is proof that the company has reached that critical Vatican stage — if you’ll remember —where they now feel comfortable *exploring* Very Bad, but Very easily made Real Ideas amongstthemselves about what would happen if they allowed their system to *nudge its users* around a different,slightly less optimal route to the bar, let’s say — without their knowledge — in order for the system to collecttraffic data for the sake of its own interests? Which would be, technically, in the interest of all Ledger usersnow and in the future, so why not? 
> The ledger could be given a focus, shifting it from a system which not only tracks our behavior, but offersdirection towards a desired result.” 
This, my dear privacy-obsessed friends, is the *real issue* with data collection — its power over huge groupsby way of their behavior and it is *never* going to be remedied in any significant way by ad-blockers or 
VPNs because the EndUser shall always out number you 50 to 1, even decades from now. EndUser does notunderstand — or, crucially, *have any desire* to understand anything technical about what leads to thePewDiePie videos playing on his filthy screen. Here’s a great opportunity to escape Silicon Valley’stechnolibertarianism and resign your Darwinian empathy in favor of meaningful and truly-effective action: ifyou want to avoid a future Google Church (or Google Government, more worryingly,) you should invest yourtime, effort, and knowledge into electing officials more capable of understanding and regulating Big Tech. 
## Google Government 
The internet as it stands is made possible by Google as *the* goto resource for online advertising. In 2016,“Google held 75.8 percent of the search ad market, bringing in $24.6 billion in revenue from search ads,”[according to ](https://www.recode.net/2017/3/14/14890122/google-search-ad-market-share-growth)[*Recode*](https://www.recode.net/2017/3/14/14890122/google-search-ad-market-share-growth). By2019, “that’s expected to grow to $36.62 billion in revenue, or 80.2 percent of the market.” Google’s edge inuser behavior and targeted advertising combined with their extensive resources available developers tointegrate independent platforms with Google’s software services at various levels makes it very difficult forany advertising-funded individual or organization to compete online without dipping in to the Googleuniverse. YouTube — a Google property since 2006 — has actively invested in and supported a new careerpath entirely within their own platform that is rapidly becoming [popularly aspired-to by young children](https://metro.co.uk/2018/01/19/children-now-more-likely-to-want-to-become-youtubers-than-actors­7241396/), while the reality of existence as a full-time YouTuber is [far less glamorous](https://medium.com/@robertoblake/what-nobody-tells-you-about-being-a-youtuber-the-youtube-middle­class-378b77eb8bc9) than the immediately-visible surface would indicate, and the effort already expendedby my generation in its pursuit has already [made us insane](http://bit.ly/searchchildren). 
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en" data-dnt="true" data-link-color="#00006b"><plang="en" dir="ltr">thanks google. <a href="https://t.co/1jRtrD77R3">pic.twitter.com/1jRtrD77R3</a></p>&mdash; David Blue (@NeoYokel) <ahref="https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/914767928456749056?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 2,2017</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script> 
So, what would the internet look like if Google didn’t exist? We know they’ve been working with thegovernment now on various projects, but what if some terrible exposed transgression of theirs suddenlywarranted an immediate shutdown and seizure of all Google properties? Well, we know from [a post onQuora](https://www.quora.com/What-would-happen-if-Google-were-to-shut-down-for-30-minutes) byGoogler Ashish Kedia that even 5 years ago, the sudden absence of Google for “2–3 mins” set the internetinto a bit of a panic, reducing overall traffic by 40%. In the time since, we’ve all grown exponentially moredependent on Google properties: billions of people rely on Google Maps for directions and, thousands ofcompanies (including the Pentagon and other government institutions) rely on Gmail and GSuites forintercommunication, file sharing, task management, etc., and more and more academic institutions rely onChromebook devices running connection-dependent operating systems. It’s not much of a stretch to arguethat Google’s sudden disappearance would constitute a Civil Emergency in the United States, which will onlybecome a stronger and more serious incentive for regulatory bodies to look the other way. 
Though the tangible results of advertising have been quantified significantly in the past 20 years, one can’thelp but wonder after watching YouTube ads for the new Mercedes-Benz S-Class on toy unboxing videos ifthe companies who spend big bucks on Google advertising understand where their money is going, but theyknow that if they *don’t* advertise there, their competitors will. This, of course, is a fundamental practice ofa monopoly, and it’s yielded Google so much fucking money that they cannot possibly spend it fast enough,as evidenced by [their investments in life extension](https://www.vox.com/science-and­health/2017/4/27/15409672/google-calico-secretive-aging-mortality-research) — so that, perhaps, they willhave more time on Earth to figure it out. 
When you build a collection of the world’s smartest people in a [self-sufficient environment](https://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/googles-monastic-vision-for-the-future-of-work) thatdiscourages exploration of other lifestyles and ideas, and you sustain the society with a gargantuan, relatively low-maintenance revenue stream, you create a culture which is not only well-primed forisolationism, but is also extremely inefficient. In fact, with its [vast collection of abandoned products andproperties](https://www.computerworlduk.com/galleries/it-vendors/google-graveyard-3508070/), Googlemust surely be one of the most inefficient companies in history. Thinking back on recent software releasesalong with its [recent entries into the hardware space](https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/4/16405184/rick-osterloh-interview-new-google-hardware-vision-htc­deal), Google is also one of the worst competing tech companies. Very little aside from Gmail, GooglePhotos, Google Maps, and Chrome have found their place or garnered significant usership. Google Play Musicis unintuitive and impossible, Google Allo and Google+ are all but forgotten addendums to other services,and Google Search — its core, original function — has been [out of control](https://theoutline.com/post/1430/google-finally-realized-that-racist-search-results-are-a-problem) for years,and all of them are designed blandly and excruciatingly tiring to look at. 
## Google Shun 
If this all has stirred nothing more in you than a desire to eliminate Google from your own online life asmuch as possible, there *are* alternatives in almost every one of the sphere’s they dominate. As of late,[DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/about) has accumulated a fair amount of [buzz and coverage](https://www.theguardian.com/global/2018/may/19/google-facebook-security-data-duckduckgo) as aprivate, more relevant alternative to Google’s plain old search engine. Though it is clever enough to list us asthe first result for “extratone,” I’ve found it simply insufficient as a replacement in my own life because,essentially, it rarely delivers what I’m looking for. By contrast, [Dropbox Paper](http://dropbox.com/paper) issuch an elegant cloud notetaking and word processing software that it makes Google Docs look simply idiotic(and warrants its own review very shortly.) For getting around, know that [MapQuest](https://www.mapquest.com) is not only [still around](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/does-mapquest-still-exist-as-a-matter-of-fact-it­does/2015/05/22/995d2532-fa5d-11e4-a13c-193b1241d51a_story.html) — it’s now a very competitivemobile navigation app. 
I, myself, have allowed Google as complete of access to my information and behavior as possible because Ibelieve “privacy” is a completely futile endeavor if one wishes to be a part of society, though I do often usealternatives to Google services simply because I *fucking hate* the way they look. If you want a morecomplete list of services and software that allow one to shun the Google God entirely, you’ll be forced toseek out less dignified sources like [*Lifehacker*](https://lifehacker.com/5876794/going-google-free-the­best-alternatives-to-google-services-on-the-web) and [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/antigoogle/) anddecide if the additional time you’ll spend using most of them to accomplish the same tasks is really worthyour digital angst. 
If Google were to be more explicit with its users and staff about its aspirations to take over control of ourlives, there will be little to do but accept the future they intend to create because they’ve long been toopowerful to control. In the meantime, I’d suggest you continue to use whatever software works best for youand refrain from wasting your time fretting on conspiratorial suppositions of what the tech industry may bedoing to “invade your privacy,” because there is no longer any such thing, nor will there be ever again.However, I would also urge to you worship your own Gods, whomever they may be, for Google will never beworthy. I, for one, shall only pray to our Mother Sun. 
#spectacle # 'Greyhound''s Top-Side Pot Shot 
![Greyhound Porthole](https://i.snap.as/HmoHf1B.jpg) 
## Examining Fred Rogers' debut Atlantic-theatre naval anxiety compilation. 
It's a little late to write about [*Greyhound*](https://letterboxd.com/film/greyhound/) - Tom Hanks' [firstscreenwriting credit](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000158/#writer) - which released [on Apple TV+](https://tv.apple.com/us/movie/greyhound/umc.cmc.o5z5ztufuu3uv8lx7m0jcega) this past Father's Day,June 21st. Though I definitely left my quite severe obsession with WWII history in my prepubescence, Ithought I'd remark on this film because I originally hoped it would fulfill a role I'd long wanted for: thedestroyer-side compliment to U-boat films like [*Das Boot*](https://letterboxd.com/film/das-boot/) and [*U­571*](https://letterboxd.com/film/u-571/). James D. Hornfischer's exceptional account of the [U.S.S. Samuel
B. Roberts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Samuel_B._Roberts_(DE-413))' part in [The Battle off Samar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_off_Samar) with [*The Last Stand of the Tin Can Sailors*](http://www.randomhousebooks.com/books/82865) was my last dive into naval history. It's one of the mostastounding war stories I've ever encountered, and upon first seeing [*Greyhound*'s trailer](https://youtu.be/eyzxu26-Wqk), I was sortof hoping it was the Big Boy film adaptation its alwayswarranted. (Though apparently there was a [TV movie](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1068999/) made in2005???) Instead, its based on (distinct from "adapted from," apparently) a 1955 novel by English author
C.S. Forester entitled [*The Good Shepherd*](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/260852968364965888/737932123159265300/The_Good_Shepherd_-_C.S._Forester.pdf). 
Tom Hanks made sure to imbue his first screenplay with a *shitload* of "[opaque naval jargon](https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/jul/06/greyhound-review-tom-hanks-second-world-war-film)," as*The Guardian*'s Peter Bradshaw's review put it. A brief ["investigation" by *The Cinemaholic*](https://www.thecinemaholic.com/greyhound-ship-world-war-ii/) suggests that the U.S.S. Keeling - the film'ssingular setting - most resembles a [*Mahan*-class destroyer](http://destroyerhistory.org/goldplater/mahanclass/), though none actually bore the name. For the actualphotography, the production made use of a surviving example of the [most mass-produced destroyer](http://destroyerhistory.org/goldplater/mahanclass/) of all time: 
> When it came to shooting the film, instead of relying completely on sets, the crew of ‘Greyhound’ foundanother option. They used USS Kidd, a real WWII destroyer, to film the journey of Greyhound. She is aFletcher-class destroyer and is named after Rear Admiral Isaac C. Kidd, the first US flag officer to die duringthe Second World War. 
As much as you're going to loathe it, I must include this commentary on *Greyhound*'s historical accuracy ifonly because - as a undoubtedly mainstream film - its been so widely and competently reviewed, already, byreal film writers. I am almost positive U-boats would rarely - if ever - waste their precious few viable torpedoshots firing ultra-close-range at the agile, super-speedy destroyers and destroyer escorts that protectedsupply convoys, and I am *sure* that none ever bothered with *audibly addressing enemy ships* over theradio in English. I understand that dramatizing historic events is the core function of *Greyhound*'s genre,but this particular addition was so unbearably cheesy that it utterly decimates all of the experience's hard-won context. Just look at a snippet from the first of two dialogues in text: 
> Greyhound. Greyhound, Greyhound. > > This is Gray Wolf.> > We hunt you and your friends> Eagle, Dicky and Harry. > > We watch your ships sinking into the deep.> 
> We hear the screams of your comrades> as they die.> > How many of them will there be> before you join them? > > The Gray Wolf is so very hungry. 
I'm sure there's an essential academic film function which only similar enemy taunts could perform andwithout which this screenplay would've been *technically* unsound, and - if I were allowed supposition - Iwould venture to guess that America's Favorite Dad felt pressured to bolster his first penning against easygimmes for the Great Big institution of cinema criticism as much as possible. *However*, this shit is justdisruptingly cheesy. Fuck it! Have the rest: 
> Greyhound!> > Your flock is not safe from this wolf. > > We can always find you> in the night to kill you.> > Or will Dicky die next? Or Harry?> > [Gray Wolf howls] > > ... > > Greyhound.> > Guten Morgen, Greyhound.> > Did you think you had slipped away> from this Gray Wolf?> > No, you did not. You will not.> > The sea favors the Gray Wolf on the hunt,> not the hound on the run. > > You and your comrades will die today. 
The contrast with the rest of the script's imposingly thorough and relentlessly-paced naval action dialogue isfar too abrupt to *not* be problematic. Even as obsessed as I was with naval history, I'm still too obliviousto the details of what is/was actually said on the bridge of a warship during combat maneuvers to tell youhow authentic *Greyhound*'s depiction really is (it's hardly ever shown on the screen or laid out innonfiction, even,) which nullifies all relevance the realism would've had, otherwise. Director Aaron Schneiderin [an interview for *Vanity Fair*](https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2020/07/greyhound-movie-tom­hanks-aaron-schneider): 
> “If you decide to read *Greyhound* by tracking the dialogue—rudder commands and sonar distances—you’ll soon find yourself completely lost. Because that’s not where the movie lives. This screenplay wasdesigned to beam you aboard the USS *Keeling*…and it’s up to you to engage with what’s going on andextrapolate how things work, so you can answer the question, ‘What the hell is going on here?’" 
In this sense - crafting a consuming, believable, unbelievably gray, claustrophobic, icing iron reality - TomHanks excels. 
<iframe width="auto" height="265" src="https://clyp.it/p1tb3ssl/widget" frameborder="0"></iframe> 
Though Letterboxd user [brucewayn](https://letterboxd.com/brucewayn/) called it "boring" in [the mostpopular review of the film](https://letterboxd.com/brucewayn/film/greyhound/) to date on the platform, Ifound *Greyhound* to be quite engaging in an anxious, depressing sense familiar to classic war dramas like*Saving Private Ryan* and *Black Hawk Down*. The tedium of naval warfare's endless orienteering isrescaled to a battlefield of lesser distances - axis and allied vessels actually collide on several occasions and aU-boat crew decides to *fuck it all* and brawl it out with two parallel destroyers with surface guns instead ofretreating after losing their ability to dive. (See: [*Titanic VI*](https://youtu.be/4uOcE_IIi30).) Through acombination of wartime compression and stitching, *Greyhound* is in large part a mashup of naval action atthe extremes of what historical fiction will allow within its 48-hour setting. From Ben Lindbergh's [review for*The Ringer*](https://www.theringer.com/movies/2020/7/9/21318481/tom-hanks-greyhound-review): 
> In *The Good Shepherd*, enemy torpedoes simply sail wide; in the movie, they graze the hull for evencloser calls. In the book, Krause agonizes over, and generally resists, calling the crew to general quarters,wary of exhausting their energy reserves; in the movie, he doesn’t hesitate to summon his sailors to battlestations. 
The result is an emotionally effective film constrained by a very specific dramatic aim: another war movieevery father can juice for decades' worth of Sunday afternoons on the sofa. "As befits his status as America'sDad, Hanks has constructed for us the ultimate Dad Movie — all the action you could ever need or want,with no annoying characters hanging around, harboring pesky needs and wants of their own," [quips GlenWeldon for *NPR*](https://www.npr.org/2020/07/10/888899608/world-war-ii-naval-drama-greyhound­charts-a-trim-efficient-course). Undoubtedly, though, the subject matter is fresh. I wouldn't say my youthdesire for a surface-side Atlantic-theatre film is 100% satiated, but *Greyhound* managed to accomplishmuch more than I expected.

# Email and I: An Abridged History 
![Hey Tile](https://i.snap.as/l7jhO5a.png) 
## Basecamp's HEY matters, and not just because it took on Apple's App Store policies. 
Something always worth celebrating: a considered, no-nonsense new effort to reimagine email. I've lived through many notable milestones in this regard: [Apple Mail](https://youtu.be/vN4U5FqrOdQ?t=2321) on the original iPhone, [Gmail] (https://time.com/43263/gmail-10th-anniversary/), Readdle's [Spark] (https://www.theverge.com/2015/5/29/8683775/spark-email-app-iphone-apple-watch), and (yes, really,) the revitalization of [Microsoft's Outlook](https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/4/17819636/microsoft-resdesigned-outlook­windows-web). Exciting innovations have abounded throughout email's history, but it's highly debatable whether or not any of them have really changed the way we use it in a profound way, yet I am unfailingly intrigued whenever somebody new comes along, so when I saw [Casey Newton's story] (https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/15/21286466/hey-email-basecamp-price-availability-platforms-launch) on *The Verge*'s frontpage discussing Basecamp's [HEY](https://hey.com/) before I got out of bed on the morning of June 15th, I was delighted to see an organization still had the courage to invest their confidence and resources into their Ideas About Email. Originally, [HEY's homepage](http://web.archive.org/web/20200510220647/https://hey.com/) included a prompt: "To get on the list, email iwant@hey.com and tell us how you feel about email. Could be a love story, or a hate story. Could be long, could be short. Itâ€™s your story, so itâ€™s up to you." Though I knew it'd likely never be read, I decided to write them a letter about my personal history with email, which turned into an entertaining enough anecdote to publish here. 
<iframe width="auto" height="auto" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UCeYTysLyGI?controls=0" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen> </iframe> 
The real reason HEY continued to be so widely covered by tech media, though, was its challenge to Apple's App Store policies after one of its updates was [rejected by the marketplace](https://www.protocol.com/hey-email-app-store­rejection) just a day after Casey's story was published. Much drama ensued - I have done my best to aggregate links to all the news stories on the subject in [a thread] (https://www.reddit.com/r/extratown/comments/hbncn6/news_surrounding_hey_the_upcoming_email_service/) on the [*Extratone* subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/extratown) I recently started. I think [the public resistance by Basecamp's CTO David Heinemeier Hansson](https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/16/21293419/hey-apple-rejection-ios­app-store-dhh-gangsters-antitrust) was probably a PR move, which is fine, but all I wanted to contribute was a review of the actual function of HEY, itself. After reading posts by some of my favorite bloggers, however, I think it would be redundant. Kev Quirk argued "[Email Is Not Broken](https://kevq.uk/email-is-not-broken/)," to which Mike Stone responded "[Email Is Broken](https://mikestone.me/email-is-broken)." Additionally, *Business Insider*'s Lisa Eadicicco published an [in-depth review](https://www.businessinsider.com/hey-email-app-review-basecamp-inbox­2020-7) at the beginning of the month. 
My singular commentary: I'm worried that subscription services that exclusively accept large yearly sums like HEY inevitably become the "country club for the most self-important emailers in business" which Casey spoke of. I guess we'll see. 
*The following is an excerpt from [my letter to HEY](http://simp.ly/p/lw0h0R) asking for a early-access invite.* 
## Email and I: An Abridged History 
I am 26 years old, so I suppose I'm of the first generation that's never experienced life *without* email. I grew up on a farm in rural central Missouri and my dad was very much an early adopter. (You'd be surprised how e-enabled farmers 
were becoming in the early 2000s.) I cannot remember life before the humongous satellite dish was anchored in our front yard. Long before I had any reason to be online (or really understood what that meant,) he began and ended every day sitting at in front of a CRT on a corner desk, clacking away on a cigarette smoke-yellowed plastic keyboard for hours. I did not understand why, then, but in retrospect I realize that he was corresponding with a huge network of neighbors, politicians, family, and college friends via email lists/chains and that he depended on it both professionally and personally in a big way. As a single man living at least an hour's drive from a city of any size, I suppose my dad was predisposed to have a rich online life long before his suburban peers, which normalized it precociously for me. 
The summer before my first grade year, my elementary school became the first in the district to have a computer lab (also the first air-conditioned room in the building,) so my high school graduating class was literally the very first to have had any digital curriculum - and an email address(!) - for the entirety of our public school experience. Because of this, I think most of us were trained to think of email as a tool for school work - it was eluded to by our computer teachers that our school email addresses were being monitored to make sure they remained so (obviously, they weren't.) As we grew into 6th-7th grade, however, we all seemed to end up with personal email addresses. I consider myself lucky to have experienced a very brief window - before instant messaging/early social networks became mainstream and SMS became even remotely pleasant to use - when my middle school friends and I corresponded exclusively by email when we weren't on the phone. 
It still sounds a bit silly to say, but I've spent the past few years coming to believe more and more strongly that my first-generation iPhone changed my life forever in a profound way - *especially* my relationship with email. After watching [Steve Job's introduction at MacWorld 2007](https://www.howtogeek.com/674796/how-to-archive-or-delete-a­facebook-group/) live, I promised to skip a year of Christmas gifts if my mom would agreed to buy me one, and she did. Obviously, it was like nothing else I'd ever experienced, and it completely changed how I responded to and thought about technology. Before smartphones, there was no checking email outside of time in the computer lab, which was intended to be quite strictly-regulated. I had a real advantage when I started bringing my iPhone to school - absolutely no one knew what it was (a bizarre thought in contrast,) including teachers. Suddenly able to browse and read my inbox in class, at lunch, and on the bus, my use and consideration of email was propelled far ahead of my peers'. 
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/RealFriendsIn5Words? src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#RealFriendsIn5Words</a> sent it to your email.</p>&mdash; David Blue (@NeoYokel) <a href="https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/906468410976079872?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 9, 2017</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script> 
When I started an online magazine in 2016, I don't think I could've conceived of the extent to which running a modern media company - even one targeted toward tech-savvy, early-adopting youth - still involves email. I assumed that my audience rarely *actually read* from their inboxes and relied almost exclusively on social networks for content discovery, so I originally forwent any implementation of a newsletter. As I grew more and more interested in and engaged with the media beat, I was exposed to the email renaissance of the past 2-3 years thanks to services like Revue and Substack, saw that it was good, and decided to give it a try for myself. I launched our semi-regular newsletter in April, 2017 on the subjects of "**Division**, **Art**, and **Media**" and published a little over 30 issues over the course of 18 months. To be honest, I'm not sure I've ever had so much fun writing. 
Very shortly after it began, I observed our general engagement quadruple, and - quite selfishly - found the process of aggregation to be soothing and very mentally restorative. It exposed some pretty horrendous media consumption habits of mine, but it also offered a painless solution to them. As soon as everything I read became a potential item in the newsletter, I wasn't just reading for myself anymore (or at least, that's the mentality it gave me,) so I could no longer afford to dismiss particular subjects as easily or to skim so recklessly. I nurtured a much less chaotic media diet and found myself absorbing *a lot* more of what I wanted to without wasting so much time burning through links. I ended up feeling more focused in other, unrelated areas of my life, too. Obviously, I love email for that, and I miss writing that darn newsletter so much that I continuously look for excuses to do something similar. 
My former Tech Editor loved email perhaps as much, but she's definitely the only person I've ever met who finds the medium as *entertaining* as I do. (If you're *really* committed, I just made a [Twitter Moment] 
(https://twitter.com/i/events/1272514574420500481?s=13) full of all the best stuff I've ever posted about email - mostly jokes like "[patron saint of email marketing](https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/921352650788130822)," but there are one or two profound posts in there, too.) We realized one day that - aside from The Webbys - there are very few notable awards celebrating excellence in the email medium, so we decided our magazine would host the 2017 First Annual Email Awards. Unfortunately, I don't think anyone else had any idea what the heck we were trying to do, so we never received enough submissions. However, I noticed a great opening paragraph in the original announcement post which I thought made a worthy conclusion: 
> Man has used electronic mail to intercommunicate, woo, build communities, topple businesses & civilizations, embezzle money, spread worms, distribute cluttered, broken links to discontinued Orscheln products, feed infants, set climate control, confirm identities, check bank account statuses, and lie to exhausted, slightly-conceited, and *newly self-published* professors. That's right - These Trillions of simple digijewels have purveyed *every single possible category of human communication*, and it's still growing strong. 
I'm excited to give Hey a try - I hope you'll consider inviting me early. I'll even send my feedback if you so desire it! If not, I'll probably end up trying a paid subscription, anyway hehe. Either way, let me wish the best of luck to your team. Win or lose, I'm glad you're taking action on your complaints, unlike the rest of us. 
Thank you!

# Goodbye, CR-V 
![CR-V Sunset](https://i.snap.as/D6s09v2.jpeg) 
*I would argue that this is the best Honda’s CR-V has ever or will ever look, no thanks to [my photographicdecisions](http://www.extratone.com/words/inred/iphone4/).* 
After 9 or so years and over 100,000 miles, *I* have totaled my mother’s 2010 Honda CR-V - the car I drovecross-country for the first time at significant distance (St. Louis to Washington, D.C. in essentially onesitting,) and once complimented for being the best possible aesthetic compromise of its near-universally andaggravatingly-compromised breed. It was my her first 1st owner experience, which is frankly a bit of ashame. If I’m completely honest, my late stepfather’s decision to outfit this utterly utilitarian vehicle withenough kit to break the $30,000 within a segment that has always clung to the 20s as one of its trulycommunicable advantages feels less-than-ideal in retrospect, but what can I say, really? It was not exactly aproud thing, but it *did* transport a lot of young families and shelter us as we’ve navigated more blizzard-like conditions than should be the norm for what is, essentially, an expensive, extended Civic. 
As per some particulars of my upbringing, I tend to get almost alarmingly attached to vehicles, but it’s hardto say I’m sad to see the CR-V go from all but the most sentimental senses. Objectively, it’s simply not ashigh-value or as competent a vehicle as it and its contemporaries are still made out to be by automotivemedia, pop culture, or the presumptions in the average consumer’s discourse. Though it was never intendedto be luxurious, the resulting automobile ended up costing real luxury money. 
## The Event 
It’s odd to have been driving so long without incident (pretty soon I’m gonna be able to say “I’ve beendriving for twenty years, bitch!) and then suddenly find oneself at fault for the accident which claimed thelife of the single most sublime, defining object in his existence. *This* incident, though, was entirely thefault of the other driver. My best friend and I were Northbound, crossing the intersection of StadiumBoulevard and Rock Quarry Road at precisely the point where it becomes College Avenue, where we were t-boned directly on the CR-V’s driver’s side rear wheel by a mid-2000s Mazda 6 that decided to run the redlight. It’s hard to guess the speed of impact, but the driver’s side side airbags deployed (as you’ll see fromthe attached photograph,) and the CR-V was spun nearly 270 degrees around the axis of the front wheels.Neither of us nor the 6’s driver was injured, but both of our vehicles are surely totaled. 
![CR-V Fucked](https://i.snap.as/em1WVnd.jpeg) 
## Third-Generation CR-V Ownership in Retrospect 
Two or three years ago, I [recorded](https://youtu.be/7ucf0Hp3eKk) some (not particularly conclusive orinformative) thoughts with my iPhone as I drove the old engorged Civic to the grocery store, when endsabruptly after I said "I think one time I did try to go fast." Like most surviving crossover nameplates, though,the narrative began with a genuinely good idea: Hondarize and modernize the Suzuki Sidekick template ontop of the Civic's platform and charge just a bit more for it - and like the rest, too, the concept has souredtremendously as both crossovers and the compact sedans upon which they're based have grown andfattened under their ever-increasing burden of safety and convenience features. (I say "burden" and not"expectation," specifically because I know a grand total of zero informed people who are at all thrilled aboutincreasing gross weights across every industry segment.) 
This CR-V was my mother’s first and only crossover following a three-car line of one or two-owner-used,well-equipped V6 Accords in her garage - the later two from the era when Honda’s mid-sized sedan becamea surprisingly dynamic driving machine as advances in drivetrain performance intercepted a point in thedevelopmental timeline just before gross weights spiked up toward their current safety and electronicequipment-bloated figures. (In other words: in the sweet spot when engines were growing more powerfulbut just before the Accord and its peers got [*fucking fat*](http://www.speedmonkey.co.uk/2012/10/honda­from-trendsetters-to-just-another.html).) In 2010, the CR-V was *almost* attractive looking as specced by [my stepfather](http://www.extratone.com/words/inred/crosscabriolet/): the combination of the roof rack,bonnet bra, and EX-trim 5-spoke alloys managed to resolve most of the discrepancies in the shapes I've seenfrom other examples, but it also drove its price above the $30,000 mark. To be fair to Honda, this decisioncould almost be considered a sortof *breach of function* considering the CR-V's original ultra-mass­produced, utilitarian purpose. 
### Interior 
Neither the leather nor the nav/infotainment system has aged very well, but it should be said that the latteris still 100% functional in 2018: it interfaces well with my iPhone 8 Plus with only the occasional "this deviceis not supported" hiccup (easily resolvable by simply re-booting the connection, in my experience.) I'm notsure how astonished I should be by the fact that the GPS still offers reliable routes 99% of the time, albeitthrough a user interface design that seems to grow more and more dated by the passing few seconds onemay have to wait for it to calculate. Accommodation remains about as uncomfortable as it was on day 1:thanks to its hard leather and the super-upright seating position common to crossovers, I must continue toinsist that operating this car is a wholly unnatural experience, but its interior surfaces shall always place wellin a contest of *robustness* and *longevity*, as they certainly should. 
### Drivetrain 
Perhaps the greatest letdown of this model year (2010) is its legacy four-speed automatic transmission, andI assume the next year's inclusion of a brand-new five-speed unit drastically improved its driving experience.The specific regret one feels when such a development arrives a year after buying any new car is one mystepfather still didn't deserve, yet he was not spared. However, if *you*, the reader, cannot be dissuadedfrom buying a CR-V of this generation for whatever *goddamned* reason, know that you must choose anexample from 2011-onward if you want to retain your sanity. No, ye olde four-speed wasn't quite as bad asthe transmission that [virtually ruined Dodge's new Dart](https://youtu.be/zs9ScPleCTw) singlehandedly, butit certainly shows its age even for the most inattentive or merciless driver. Without it, I would vouch for the2.4L four-cylinder's performance as adequate, but its contribution was and forever shall be let down by theaging transmission's developing Alzheimer's. Simply put: they are an unacceptably mismatched team. 
Though I shall forever argue that part-time all-wheel-drive is almost never actually justified in normal use ­and yet inadequate for any “extreme” use, for that matter - Honda’s hydraulic “Super-Handling All-Wheel-Drive” did indeed aid our CR-V’s way in a handful of circumstances throughout my mother’s ownership,though neither of our memories of these are robust enough to cite specifics. The single no-bullshit *blizzard*we experienced was the same type I managed to navigate years later in a sub-compact Chevrolet to reachMagFest 2016, if perhaps less intense. I would speculate that the system increases mechanical drag - andtherefore fuel consumption - to a degree that couldn’t possibly justify what little aid it has offered in *our*use, at least.

# Honda: From Trendsetters to Just Another Car Company 
![Accord Front](https://i.snap.as/z1ZlwRU.jpeg) 
## South Korea is poised to take Japan's place in the American market. 
The 1990s. Not the greatest time for the United States auto industry. In those days, with a few exceptions,American cars were all overpriced, devoid of quality and generally unreliable. The big three (along with manyother non-automotive related corporations in the U.S.) had an aging generation of management. This groupdecided that the ideal way to run their business involved expending the least amount of effort into theirproducts as possible, without reducing the price paid by customers. Essentially, they hoped to gain moreprofit from less product. I don't have to tell you that this thinking just...doesn't work. I would theorize thatthis mentality came from overconfidence and a lack of joy in production. GM, Ford, and Dodge had been thetop sellers of the automobile in the United States since its invention. They originally symbolized the best inquality, luxury and performance. Consumer and producer shared the same values, resulting in a flourishingmarket. It was a joyous time. And then, somewhere around the 1973 oil crisis, the joy began seeping out ofour star shooters. Maybe it was emissions regulations, a loss of those ideal values, or some other factor.Regardless of the source, our homegrown auto industry lost its passion. It reflected in the cars that werebuilt. Designs were reused, progression was halted, the irreverence of quality workmanship lost. “Americandependability” became an ironic statement. 
And then came along a company that had been building little, noisy two-stroke engines to fit to bicycles onlyfour decades earlier, proudly displaying a banner the changing public couldn't refuse. They offered a productthat was simple, honest, reliable, durable and reasonably priced. A concoction that smelled an awful lot likehigh value. An odor that no doubt brought back old memories. The Accord, suburban America's new familypet. And the Civic, conveniently debuted in 1972. The college student's greatest companion. Both wereconservatively styled and equipped, and thus quite easily ignored, which was exactly what the countrywanted. After all those years stranded on the shoulders of our aging interstate system in lumbering,underpowered beasts, the indestructible and dependable qualities of the Hondas came as a breath of freshair. So. What made the newcomers so different? What was the driving force behind the value of theproducts? It was something not unknown to the Americans, and its presence had been sorely missed. Picturean ancient sage by the name of Soichiro Honda saying something to the order of “Lets build the bestautomobile we can and sell it for as little as possible.” Though the man is more a symbol than an actualinfluence on the four-wheeled endeavors of the institution bearing his name, he represents what led to thesame group's success. Honda was untainted by an unrealistic attitude, and unaided by a century of heritageand good reputation. They succeeded only because they built good cars. 
![Accord Mark One](https://i.snap.as/C5R7hZa.jpeg) 
By 2008, Honda had more than made a name for itself. Over the past decade, though, the prices had beensteadily increasing, along with the level of luxury and complexity available in their cars. Both the Accord andCivic were bestsellers in their respective classes, and had held their titles for a relatively long time. It wasthen that I personally theorized they might take the same path American carmakers had taken only a shortwhile before. I don't want to brag, but this was long before Ron Kiino's bold title “Is Hyundai the newHonda?” graced the pages of MotorTrend's October 2011 issue. And it was really a far-fetched notion at thetime. Simply a suspicion. Confidently and stubbornly, the Accord held its grip on mid-size sedan sales in theUnited States, complimented by the Toyota Camry, a similar-looking but even more ignorable competitor.The former still held appeal for someone with the capacity to enjoy themselves. The latter, however, hasalways been the most desirable choice of individuals that absolutely despise driving. They both held theirslightly different niches, with no real fear of losing their place. Then, Honda started skimping a bit on quality.Motoring journalists noticed a lack of improving fuel economy, aging transmissions, and a general loss incompetitive edge in the 2011 Accord. Not the best time to start slacking on Honda's part. 
![Sonata Front](https://i.snap.as/JwoqLyt.jpeg) 
This was the year that Hyundai unveiled the brilliantly-updated 6th generation Sonata. I consider this to be the most significant car to come in the mid-sized segment since the birth of the Accord/Camry duo. Inprevious generations, it had always been competitively priced. The quality, though, had been lacking. TheKoreans were not afraid to design a car that was much less conservative than the two Japanese giants.However, the designs were never really all that great looking. Interesting and different? Yes.Attractive?....No. So these attributes kept Honda and Toyota secure under their cozy comforter of sales, notintimidated by Hyundai's offering. And that's quite understandable. The Sonata never really seemed a directcompetitor to the giants. The new one, however, completely changed the game. For one thing, it's gorgeous.Not conservatively pretty, but ridiculous, in the best sort of way. Poised and angular, the exterior looks as ifit should cost exponentially more than it does. They managed to carry on the Sonata's tradition of uniquestyling by rejecting the old car completely and replacing it with a stunner. The interior reflects a similarattitude. It's not only good looking, but significantly more fuel efficient than any other mid-sized car on themarket. The drivetrain options are excellent. The best part, though, is the price. At a starting MSRP of19,195 USD (£11,944), it is several thousand less than any competitor. 
![Sonata Interior](https://i.snap.as/s3Kfq8g.jpeg) 
All of this really just makes the Accord and Camry look silly. It's interesting that Hyundai should take upHonda's original niche, given how different their backgrounds are. Our original hero of practicality wascreated by a man tinkering with small motorcycles. The former, however, was founded as a massiveconstruction firm, only later trying its hand in the realm of automobiles. Cars seemed an alternative forHyundai, but certainly not an afterthought. Regardless of where they came from, these two companies havehad very similar philosophies, if only separated by time. Also, both have had to rely on sheer ingenuity forprofit, without the foothold of heritage in the American market. It could be said, though, that Hyundai isdoing a bit better. High value cars that are practical and interesting as an experience. Honda could never getthat last bit quite right. Or perhaps it's just a sign of the times. Maybe Americans have overcome thecompulsion to ignore our cars. My question is this; Has this flip-flop in production attitude become a cycle?And if so, who will be in the hot spot next? My bet is on the big three, believe it or not. A new generation ofmanagement has brought about a huge improvement in our products. It could even be one of the risingChinese companies in the future. Who knows? I can tell you that right now, though, Hyundai has got thegoods.

# I Bought a Desktop 
![Hildur](https://i.snap.as/M42wH2VG.png) 
## I bought a desktop tower for the first time since 2010 and spent an embarrassingly long time struggling with Bluetooth shit. 
As with my [entire history](https://bilge.world/hp-spectre-x360-review) of computer purchases, my acquisition of an [HP ENVY Desktop tower](https://support.hp.com/us-en/document/c06443577), today, was last-minute, ill-informed, and certainly irrational. You "PC master race" folk: please spare me the _dude, you could've just built your own pc so much cheaper_ shit.\[efn\_note\]Or don't. Whatever.\[/efn\_note\] Yes, I realize the sensible course of action would've begun with a two hour trip West to the closest Microcenter, where I'm sure the staff would've made PC shopping an absolute blast and I would've come away with a more powerful, much cheaper machine. However, after I managed to [break Windows](https://www.davidblue.wtf/finally-broke-windows/) on my only machine this weekend (and subsequently failed to reset it,) I was getting especially behind on schoolwork and had _absolutely no desire_ to complete any of it on my iPhone. 
And so... I've just returned from picking up said HP Tower along with a [27" HP LED display] (https://store.hp.com/us/en/pdp/hp-27f-27-inch-display#!), and am writing you after having set up the machine physically and installed most of my "essential software" list (at least all that I could remember.) As per my favorite tradition of new computer acquisition, I have named the machine after [Hildur Odegard] (https://fortitude.fandom.com/wiki/Hildur_Odegard) from _Fortitude_: 
## "First Impressions" 
It's been exactly 10 years since I last bought a desktop tower - since I first set hands on the Dell XPS Studio desktop with which I would create the majority of my intellectual property - and I was immediately surprised by how much smaller\[efn\_note\]6.12 x 11.93 x 13.28 inches.\[/efn\_note\] and lighter\[efn\_note\]13.12 lbs.\[/efn\_note\] this tower was than my expectations. The display, too, is remarkably light and thin. Rationally, I should not have been surprised by this, but I'm not going to punish myself for continuing to find any sort of magic in technology. 
In the box were a Bluetooth keyboard\[efn\_note\]Specifically, an HP model [4251a-khsap003k] (https://fccid.io/EMJKHSA-P003K).\[/efn\_note\] and mouse set - the latter of which I will hopefully never have to use, thanks to my [Logitech G203](https://youtu.be/oIAY1-aW8Es) - and was perplexed by the process of how to pair the former with the tower while it was in setup mode for far too long. I was just about to give up entirely when I revisited the packaging and noticed what I'd previously assumed was an anti-theft device, but was actually the fucking dongle for the pair. I continue to despise Bluetooth peripherals, obviously, but the multimedia function keys of the product led to some important realizations: I now had reason to use Windows Desktop Switching _and_ have a calculator application again! However, I have yet to figure out how to alter the Function key's behavior (I'm not even sure it's possible:) in order to input **Alt+F4**, I have to input **Fn+Alt+F4**, which is far too clunky to depend on. The issue did lead to a revelation which I may or may not integrate permanently: I mapped **Alt+F4** to the previously-unused button on the very top of the G203. So far, it's been pretty nifty. 
![HP 4251a-khsap003k](https://i.snap.as/2kLqJ1uB.jpg) 
*The HP 4251a-khsap003k included in the box with my new HP desktop.* 
That said, a component of [my](https://www.notion.so/rotund/Desktop-Workspace­d371dd0bac4d415baac734e89db0b93d) [i](https://www.notion.so/rotund/Desktop-Workspace­d371dd0bac4d415baac734e89db0b93d)[ntention](https://www.notion.so/rotund/Desktop-Workspace­d371dd0bac4d415baac734e89db0b93d) to create an intentional, static, upright-sitting desktop workspace included an allotment for a quality mechanical keyboard - my justification was that any professional in a particular craft makes a point to have the best possible tools for the job, so a high-quality keyboard has actually been _very_ long overdue, in my case. So, I sought out [a single _Wirecutter_ rec](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/our-favorite­mechanical-keyboards/)[o](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/our-favorite-mechanical-keyboards/) [mmendations list](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/our-favorite-mechanical-keyboards/) and even attempted to disseminate [r/MechanicalKeyboards](https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/).\[efn\_note\]I haven't even started self-harming yet, so my stomach is definitely strengthening!\[/efn\_note\] After a brief jaunt, I concluded that no reasonable person would be able to make heads or tails of the forum or [its seemingly endless wikis] (https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/wiki/index) without considerable indoctrination so I more or less threw a dart and landed on the [Varmilo VA108M](https://mechanicalkeyboards.com/shop/index.php? l=product_detail&p=3504), which I ordered. All I know is that it's fairly highly-reviewed on the marketplaces I checked (though hardly mentioned on the subreddit, actually,) and that it has the _Cherry Switches_, which are... [The good ones] (https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/comments/d3hmw3/my_new_baby_varmilo_108m_cherry_mx_blues _the/). 
A concern I originally had with taking over the tertiary guest room - by far the smallest allotted living space in the house 
-as my office was its distance from our wireless router, two floors down. The last time I used the room as a workspace (five years ago,) my old tower's integrated WiFi card often struggled to maintain a reliable connection. The adapter included in this desktop, though, actually managed to clock [the fastest download speed on my SpeedTest.net records] (https://www.speedtest.net/result/10021332678) just now. 
![SpeedTest Results](https://www.speedtest.net/result/10021332678.png) 
Somehow, I just managed to clock the [highest download speed on my record] (https://www.speedtest.net/result/10021332678) from two floors up! 
## Bad(ish) 
It's almost painful even to write this but... As beautiful as this $250 display is to behold, I've grown accustomed to my [Surface Laptop 2](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/surface/business/surface-laptop-2)'s **2256 x 1504 13"** display after years of hard, daily use. Apparently, those dimensions mean the little machine's display has a pixel density of **201 Pixels-Per-Inch**. Filling a **27"** display with just **1920 x 1080** means a pixel density of just **81.6 Pixels-Per-Inch**,\[efn\_note\]I suppose I should not have been surprised to immediately discover a [dedicated online tool](https://www.calculatorsoup.com/calculators/technology/ppi-calculator.php) for calculating pixel density.\ [/efn\_note\] and the disparity was glaring to my eyes, even from the setup screen. After a few hours of regular use, I'm not sure I notice it anymore, but I suspect I will again when I've got the laptop running again. Please do indicate whether or not you think such a complaint makes me awful in the [Crowdsignal poll](https://poll.fm/10603399) below.

[This video] (https://youtu.be/55yn-zF_dZY) provided some help - I know now that I have to open Sound Settings and manually connect the headphones every time I re-connect them. Hopefully, I'll figure out another solution soon. 
Returning to the webcam issue: I discovered that absolutely _zero_ local stores keep add-on webcams in stock anymore, which makes sense. I resorted to searching Amazon for webcams and found a gargantuan list of brands I had never heard of. When I filtered by the one I _did_ recognize - Logitech - I saw barely-facelifted versions of the camera my stepdad bought in 2008 and none were in stock. Unwilling to further investigate or research more, I set the price filter for under $40, sorted by customer ratings, and bought the first product which had even remotely legitimate-looking reviews: [this 1080p _thing_] (https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08BQZT4N8/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) branded with "Mersuii." 
After returning to the order invoice hours later for this post, I got curious enough to Google search the company name and discovered a dead-end url, zero Wikipedia page, and [this Trademark registration] (https://trademarks.justia.com/863/53/mersuii-86353116.html), on which I spotted some very interesting information.

# O'er the Ice for Stupified Usury 
![HP Spectre x360](https://i.snap.as/DlQZXor.jpg) 
## A laptop, purchased. The beginning of a new era, finally witnessed. 
*I managed to be reckless, tedious, and zealous in the usually-dry process of purchasing a new laptop, andfound the story worth sharing. Expect a full review of the HP Spectre in the coming weeks.* 
The meteorological complaints you’ve been hearing from mid-Missouri since Friday aren’t inappropriate thistime – the middlefolk faced one of their most fatal enemies – a well-laid minefield of black ice. It slowed our timid, ABS-oblivious society to ten percent or less of its already near-postmortem pace. 
*For God’s sake, at least learn [why you needn’t pump your brakes ](http://web.archive.org/web/20161224044948/http://auto.howstuffworks.com/auto-parts/brakes/brake­types/anti-lock-brake.htm)before you opt for infotainment extras or… get your driver’s license.* 
I woke up with the same debt and imminent expenses as I did the day before and without any moreintention of buying a premium laptop than I’ve had for the two years I’ve gone [without one](http://web.archive.org/web/20161224044948/http://www.extratone.com/tech/ios10/). 
Without the concept of mobile computing in its entirety, actually. I knew I’d lost my desire to carry a loosebluetooth keyboard around everywhere in case some insight were to fall upon me heavy enough to justifyreaching for it over my 6S Plus in a public venue, hunched and squinting. There’s still nothing better atcranking out copy than the Lap Top Computer, I suppose. I was holding out for a truly-substantialalternative to Windows 10 and macOS, wanting to be enchanted by lite delights like Acer’s cheekyChromebook R11, but had decided in self-pity that I’d probably never be able to stand a new operatingsystem ever again. 
My mom graciously decided to take me mall shopping for Christmas, which is comforting in its tradition ofvapid routine. The state of a given midwestern metropolis’s mall is a keen indicator of the culture’s soul, I’vefound, and ours is mostly crewed by destitute alcoholics, who are my closest kin, and therefore my mostappropriate company for *the holidays*. 
**Dillard’s is the second-best place to lose your mind in America.** 
Even now, when the somber corners are not quite so desolate. The acoustic sensation cannot beexperienced anywhere else – the battlecries of the Me Generation’s pop reproduced by hateful diaphragmsbehind their white plastic ceiling facades and absorbed again by palletloads of mass-manufacturedstonewashed denim, seemingly coming from a far-off wholesale nether no matter where in the store you’vebeen buried. Ours is a few decades old, now – weathered and alone, which accentuates the whole dystopiawith a resolute air of infinity, as if it’s certain it will outlast me. It probably will. 
![HP Spectre x360](https://i.snap.as/ggT8UR5.jpg) 
I was deep within it all when I came across Dan Seifert’s [praising review](http://web.archive.org/web/20161224044948/http://www.theverge.com/2016/12/12/13914962/hp-spectre­x360-review-2016-laptop) of the HP Spectre x360. As I’ve constantly confessed, *The Verge*‘s lot are theonly institution of their kind I’ve come close to trusting *too much*, so it was no small thing to seesomething so certain as “the premium laptop to buy this year” in his subhead. 
The last time I was in the market for a laptop, there was little room for aesthetics in the equation. We havebeen taught this past decade that beautiful devices come in fruit form, only. Somehow, I allowed myself tointegrate the ridiculous sentiment that MacBooks were the only option for anyone with any reverence fortactile experience. As I expect you’re aware of to at least some degree by now, Apple’s diligent study ofdesirability over the years is the singular force behind their lordship, and it’s the token MO of tech opinion to confuse it with sex appeal, resulting in expressions like “[apple hardware device] is sexy,” which is a pityinglydesperate delusion. Do you actually find brushed aluminum appealing in any bodily sense? 
We did once, of course. Your infatuation with the stuff probably peaked the moment you first grazed it, and
– if you’re anything like me – you could be harboring more aesthetic frustration with their longstandingoccupation than you think. Infatuation must be starved to survive, and we’ve been eating up Apples by thebushel for a decade. 
Haha. 
But really, though – by the *billion*. 
I saw images in that Spectre review which I was completely satisfied with. I watched that new HP logo as ittraveled through the frames, stupefied. Out of precious ignorance, I experienced real desire in thatundesirable place. (Which could actually represent some sort of defeat on my part, but I’m not toobothered.) 
![HP Spectre x360](https://i.snap.as/wcEdRy2.jpg) 
And in the midst of those desolate people in their fortress of mediocrity, my mom and I hatched a plan toindulge upon the best part of desolation – impulsive, subsidized gluttony. We’d stop by the pharmacy to fillmy anti-depressant script before renavigating Bourgeois Bumper Cars to get to Best Buy, where she’d let meuse her credit line to purchase my final choice in the segment. 
**Best Buy is the best place to lose your mind in America.** 
I could’ve sworn it made good sense to me, once – in Middle School, when my friend and I were spendingmost of our free time emulating the first generation of tech-reviewing YouTubers – but now, it reminds meof a darkwood restaurant with its closing fluorescents on, shining in the inverse frequency of a bug zapper –casting a more effectively-repelling ambiance for the human psyche than anything else *I’m* capable ofdreaming up, at least. 
I used to fucking *visit* that store for no purpose but to see and experience the diluted bit of the handsetrenaissance with enough momentum to coast its way here. I probably spent a full sixty minutes wanderingaround by my own volition on a handful of occasions. 
But these days, I am perturbed from the onset in a big way. There are too many blue vape enthusiasts onthe sales floor at any given time, and they all want me to leave. They loaf around the carcass of consumertechnology’s passion, not realizing, I guess, that I already know it ’twas they who killed it. (The stench isstrongest by the wearables.) It’s eerie how little the Big Box itself has changed, considering the decade theirgoods have traveled. 
Under a fittingly-gray sky, I wash my pill down with La Croix and a Kind bar to preempt the appropriaterumination in my mouth as we inch toward my Final Financial Doom with the spooked sliders. Though wenever exceed 5mph, there are abandoned vehicles littering the shoulders and medians in varyingly absurdorientations. But I do not jest – today, I am silent, for I am one of them. 
By the time we reach the store, my medicine has once again placed my soul in Safe Mode, so we shuffle intothe grotesque thing. There are four employees in sight – no one else – and they all send their beady eyesmy way. I have too much purpose in my consumerist jowls to pause, though, so I rush to the laptops nearthe opposite wall in an attempt to get an early estimate on my current level of personal computing idiocy.Naturally, my Mom snags one of another four associates immediately. In this work, I shall refer to him asZoroaster. 
![HP Spectre x360](https://i.snap.as/pCbk7GB.jpg) 
Despite having never seen 80% of the displayed devices in person before, I am able to spot the Spectres quickly, which is a good sign. I am immediately elated by the contrast to the depressing mushbooks Iremember HP making in the oughts. The bezel… the brilliance of the display… the details of the visible body.I open *Extratone*. I open *The Verge*. I am hoping that Windows 10 will not be as much of a kicker asI’ve expected. 
I’m not a minute before Mom and Zoroaster have found the new MacBook Pros. Nobody remembers thepassword to the 13-inch, but the 15 is showing off its “deep blacks” and “Space Gray” mood. The Vergelooks phenomenal, and its icon in the touchbar catches my eye. I manage to use it to switch tabs, the less-attuned degenerate in me noting the extra spanning required over CMD-TAB. 
“Have you tried the new keyboard?” asks Zoroaster. 
I hadn’t. It’s as indescribable as you’ve heard, but suggests legitimacy is Apple’s effort to bridge thetransition from physical keyboards to their touch replacement. Terrifying legitimacy. 
“You get used to it,” he says. 
I open Pages and click out something ridiculous. Yeah… *click*. I’m sure there’s a better onomatopoeiaavailable by way of just about any technology website, but I didn’t bother to study the sensation afterrealizing that it’s a con for my number one use of a Portable Computer – ***clacking***. 
It’s not as if the thing isn’t gorgeous, though, in its way. After years of usership, I can tell you that it isundoubtedly a superb execution of the MacBook marque. It’s polished. It’s The New One. But it is also bleakand slateish. Some might even say *dystopian*. Do I want to carry such a thing around with meeverywhere? Do I even want to carry it *out of the store?* What will I tell my friends? *What will I tell mystaff?* 
$2,000 of my future spent on what is now a piece of *distinctly* establishment design… 
I return to the x360 to see what can be done about Windows’ appearance these days. 
*Purple-gray taskbars… Hm.* 
**It’s a sale.** 
Let me be honest with you – I spent some ninety minutes going between the two. Even if I’d endured theshame and self-disappointment of choosing the MacBook Pro, the simple grunt of the *challenge* theSpectre presents to it is no small milestone. 
As Zoroaster scrambles to remove my new machine from *The Hanging Jail*, I am drained from thedecision, but aware that my perspective on the world has changed. I’ve been working on an editorial for thepast few weeks that’s mostly alarmed howling about the industry’s utter lack of passion, as of late, butseeing the Windows-running department’s devices and their matured design – *finally* beautiful withoutobvious Apple influence – had truly revived some little flame of hope within me. 
Lithe Zoroaster was confused by UPCs a bit, as is understandable, and began juggling three Spectre boxesatop the prison lift, screaming the numbers – one at a time from each device – to his bewildered disciple,below. 
Throughout the later half of the whole ordeal, I’d had company – some sort of blonde working man who’dalso braved the frictionless waste to calm himself with debt. I’d been elated at the opportunity forcompanionship, at first, but he’d found himself unable to escape the store’s bespoke Apple Hole. I did mybest to help him, but failed hoist his girth from the 15’s benchmark suction. I’d left him there, bound. Maymy dreams n’er be haunted by the fading portrait of his tortured, middle class face. 
As the Best Boys did their dance, he somberly came to my side. The grimace he’d worn in the struggle hadfallen away. I knew what was coming before he formed the defeated words: “go ahead and grab me the 500 
while you’re up there.” As one does when they stumble upon a stranger’s funeral, I bowed my head. Here begins the part that sorta makes me look like an idiot. After signing my mother’s lengthy loan agreement, Zoroaster – the little devil – asked if I wanted the
*Special Edition*, just behind me. I’d stopped by last year’s Big Boy Spectre – the ballsy-ass copper-toned
masterpiece – and had wished for a moment that the look could’ve carried to the fresher x360. The monospace Hewlett-Packard logo blinded me, and the unlit display (it hadn’t been set up yet) concealedthe wider bezel of… The older Spectre 13t – with which I write, now. 
I didn’t notice my blunder until after our treacherous return, and could not care less. #hardware 
# Illiteracy in American Media 
![Tump](https://i.snap.as/5NU852K.png) 
Ten percent of the United States' adult population cannot functionally read or write ([conservatively] (http://literacy.kent.edu/)) despite the exponential increase of required reading in the average American's day-to-day life thus far in the 21stcentury. For written American media, especially, one would assume that a financial and social incentive for maximum literacy in the populace should present a straightforward justification for intense widespread coverage of this particular disparity, yet most related coverage in mainstream national magazines and newspapers is alarmingly sparse and often requires a less-than-socially-conscious context (e.g. a [for-profit startup] (https://www.fastcompany.com/90259739/this-mobile-learning-platform-aims-to-combat-the-hidden-epidemic-of-adult­illiteracy)) to actually appear in news feeds. From the most wholesome assumption of the industry's general values -­that it holds "[newsworthiness](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/newsworthy)" above all -- we must assume that it does not generally consider American illiteracy "interesting enough to the general public to warrant reporting" as we examine the intermittent discourse surrounding the issue that *does* achieve publication. 
In late October, the American business and technology magazine *Fast Company* covered the recent successes of the "for-profit social enterprise" Cell-Ed, noting that "a huge portion of the American labor force is illiterate," which it described as "a hidden epidemic." The article's author, Rick Wartzman, mentions foremost that Cell-Ed's userbase is largely "foreign-born" and expected to eclipse one million in number by the end of 2019. Demographically, the magazine's readership is predominantly middle to upper-class, who are the least affected social groups by a significant margin as per illiteracy's strong correlative relationship with poverty. These factors combine to limit any real social consequences from such an article. 
In direct contrast with the professional, market-minded perspective of modern business magazine, even niche independent publications from the opposite end of the media spectrum often trivialize, belittle, or generally mishandle the issue. In [a 500-word "Editorial"](https://www.baptiststandard.com/opinion/editorials/if-you-can-read-this-be­thankful/) written by *The* Editor [Eric Black](https://twitter.com/EricBlackBSP) of the *Baptist Standard* -- a small evangelical news website describing itself as "Baptist voices speaking to the challenges of today's world" -- he points to a *global* increase in "illiterate people," as he so comfortably brands them. Such language is inevitably counter­productive and potentially insensitive: to the eyes and ears of activists, educators, and the general public, such a term unnecessarily lends toward a restricted perspective of those people who have been left behind by the institution of read and written language in one manner or another and portrays them as a great vague collection of lingual lepers bearing their own distinct, inexorable, wordless ethnicity which *inevitably* bars them from the freedoms allowed by the Editor's learned capacity, including the ability to actually read his words of affliction. Simply put, he has dangerously oversimplified the issue. 
To once again assume the best and infer that Black had a specific purpose in publishing his ill-supported opinion beyond continuity's sake of [his weekly Editorials](https://www.baptiststandard.com/opinion/editorials/), it appears to be the promotion of a local Texan literacy "ministry" called [Literacy Connexus](http://www.literacyconnexus.org/), though no further specifics about the project are provided beyond "helping churches develop literacy programs for their communities, provide training and resources to overcome illiteracy," which is virtually identical to the introductory copy on [the organization's homepage](http://www.literacyconnexus.org/). 
So far, we've examined coverage only in special interest media, but what about legacy news organizations with the largest readerships in the United States? Despite oblivious use of the same ledes, a newspaper like *The Washington Post* can wield vast influence over the broadest possible readership and the public editorial trust. In November 2016, veteran reporter Valerie Strauss published "[Hiding in plain sight: The adult literacy crisis] (https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/answer-sheet/wp/2016/11/01/hiding-in-plain-sight-the-adult-literacy-crisis/)" for *Answer Sheet* -- her weekly newsletter designed to function as "a school survival guide for parents (and everyone else), from education policy to psychology" -- which represents the most substantial discussion of American illiteracy in topical, widely-visible media (i.e. presence in a succinct search engine query.) She briefly introduces the issue with a bulleted list of illiteracy's consequences on modern society and the individual cited from a [Canadian literacy foundation](https://www.fondationalphabetisation.org/en/) before turning the stage over to [Lecester Johnson] (https://aohdc.org/about-us/staff/lecester-johnson-chief-executive-officer/), CEO of the [Academy of Hope Adult Public Charter School](https://aohdc.org/about-us/staff/lecester-johnson-chief-executive-officer/) in Washington D.C. 
Johnson presents a passionate and well-informed exploration of the state of the literacy battle from the perspective of a full-time, locally on-the-ground advocate. Her op-ed's introduction includes the most essential observations and statistics throughout, noting "the children of parents with low literacy skills are more likely to live in poverty as adults and are five times more likely to drop out of school," before setting upon a detailed examination of current and relevant organizations working toward *solutions*. Of course, it's largely centered upon her own organization, which she claims has "helped more than 6000 adults rebuild their education and job opportunities since 1985." 
It's significant that an institution as deeply embedded across the American political spectrum as *The Washington Post* address the issue of American illiteracy, and both Johnson and Strauss are certainly qualified voices for the undertaking, but when we examine this particular article, it's important we consider the context of the *Answer Sheet* newsletter and its intended audience. Though it's no challenge to pitch the importance of reading and writing to parents and professional educators, the most alarming and destructive issue at hand is the educational disparity between *their adult peers*. "There's a literacy problem in the capitol, but I'm not talking about young people who can't read. Many adults -­perhaps even parents sitting next to you at back to school night -- don't possess academic skills," notes Johnson with her very first paragraph. However, considering the nature of parenthood, the audience primarily consuming these words are undoubtedly preoccupied with *juvenile* issues, specifically, and we can assume their capacity to empathize with their fellow working adults who could benefit from literacy education is actually *lessened* from that of childless readers of the same age as a result. "Despite the magnitude of the adult literacy crisis, most of those needing to make up lost ground are pushed toward traditional classroom settings--even though many of these people can't possibly follow through because of cost or work schedules or other obstacles," she attests. 
Perhaps more than any other American city, Detroit has been struggling with a serious illiteracy problem. According to [a profile of the Beyond Basics program](https://www.wxyz.com/news/conquering-illiteracy-one-neighborhood-at-a­time-with-beyond-basics-program) (which was adapted from an embedded video broadcast) on their local ABC affiliate's website, forty-seven percent of adult Detroiters cannot read, but even companies like General Motors -- who donated \$250,000 to the Beyond Basics program earlier in mid-October -- are getting involved. The article quotes Elijah Craft, a young man who was "reading at a first-grade level as a senior at Detroit's Central High School." "Craft would rare venture from home for fear he would get lost because he could not read street signs," reports *WXYZ* anchor [Carolyn Clifford](https://www.wxyz.com/about-us/staff/carolyn-clifford). She frames the narrative around a reference to the 2009 film *The Blind Side* starring Sandra Bullock: "here, you might call this story 'The Detroit Side.'" For local television news, this reference to popular culture likely strengthened the story's power ensnare viewers' emotional attention when it was aired, and even in this written accompaniment, it proves an effective -- if a bit crude -­analogy. The broadcast of Mr. Craft's interview also depicts his own deep emotional investment in reading when he begins to shed tears, which is not entirely communicated in the written article. 
When the American news media discusses American illiteracy, it's almost always in secondary or tertiary form: either by way of a short post for a weekly education newsletter, an ultra-low-distribution niche editorial column, or a personality profile of a local activist. Perhaps the fundamental obstacle in the face of increasing the discourse surrounding this issue is that its resolutions will require -- perhaps more than any other social issue in this country -­advocacy by those who *can* read on behalf of those who *cannot* because of how sensitive and isolated many of them feel. When voices of advocates like Lecester Johnson *are* uplifted by major organizations like *The Washington Post*, the sociological weight of the illiteracy issue can be very powerful. In quoting former United Nations chief Kofi Annan, she sums up for its extensive audience what the facts should ultimately mean to them: 32 million of Eric Black's so-called "illiterate people" in the United States of America have been and continue to be deprived of their "***human right***" to functional literacy.

# West-Coast Indie Folk is Full of Battery-Burgling Megachurch Bands 
![Indie Folk Battery Burglary](https://i.snap.as/GewgcRj.jpg) 
I have to just ***fucking do it*** — I’m going to start writing about music in this space. There’s virtuallyzero chance that I’ll shout over other voices of music criticism as long as *Bilge* remains so poorly optimizedfor SEO, and Portland, Oregon has been far too confusing to deprive myself the opportunity to work out*any* understanding of its youth culture. It’s not a lack of talented musicians in the area — the opposite istrue — but a severe drought of the kind of tragedy and trauma which ultimately give acoustic Americanmusical expression *its whole shit*. What I caught of the weekend’s invasion with Santa Cruz musicianswere all praiseworthy, tight and confident performers who’d obviously invested heavily in their equipmentand their presence here. [Joe Kaplow](https://joekaplow.bandcamp.com/) arrived with a sort of bespokemagazine rack containing 20 neatly-arranged effect pedals, leading me to wonder for a moment if I wasabout to witness *banjo powerviolence* for the first time, but he explained that he simply preferred theiravailability, and wouldn’t use “more than a few at once,” and seemed almost genuinely perturbed by myattempt to explain the specific industrially-influenced involvement of audio hardware in hardcore punk andgrind performance which I was referring to with the term. (“Powerviolence” has apparently become anambiguous one around these parts, and I’m sure he was actually just *utterly uninterested*.) 
![Indie Folk Battery Burglary](https://i.snap.as/2vEevFd.jpg) 
![Indie Folk Battery Burglary](https://i.snap.as/hwDHYHy.jpg) 
No more than two dozen guests made up their peak crowd of witnesses, yet Joe and his band certainly madegood on shear effort expended in laying down a hearty, back-to-back recital for us at an unusuallyprotracted rate, though apparently either they, the [Getaway Dogs](https://getawaydogs.bandcamp.com/),or [The Curfews](https://thecurfews.bandcamp.com/) had insisted that a “cover charge” be collected at thedoor of the house show. It’s not my business to to dwell on or attempt to investigate an unsubstantiatablerumor, but I understand this could have been a breach of house show etiquette. What I *do* know is thatone of the visiting musicians stole 4 flat AA batteries out of my [COOLPIX](https://flic.kr/s/aHsmqBwfDZ)and *apparently* attempted to jack its ancient Compact Flash card, which is only hilarious because theydidn’t succeed. Regardless, it should be said that Joe Kaplow’s songwriting is more flattered by [Indie mags](https://glidemagazine.com/209034/song-premiere-folk-singer-joe-kaplow-searches-for-sense-of-home-with­i-said-i-was-going-and-i-went/) than my own ears, though one still wishes for a more substantive topic than“I thought it’d be cool make a corn cob pipe, so I did.” Then again, much of what you’ll find at this URLreads a lot like “I thought it’d be interesting to make a WordPress blog, so I did.” White people have trulyrun out of shit to say, haven’t we? 
> The inspiration that sparked ‘I Said’ moved me like a puppet. So much so that I had to pull over at the topof Altamont Pass, by the huge windmills, and write the song in the back of my van.
> > Joe Kaplow for *Glide Magazine* 
Reflection upon just about anything can have personal meaning, but no amount of musicianship can mask astark lack of context. I do wonder if Indie Folk should just return to the megachurch, where songwriters likeJoe and musicians of his crew’s sort are literally *handed* a gigantic audience of trained experts at findingprofound meaning where it probably isn’t, along with great salaries, from what I hear. Otherwise, all thattaxing preparation and expenditure will only lead to more forgettable performances. Or perhaps I am simplymisguided in my assumption that artists work exclusively to communicate *something* lasting to*someone*. Every conversation I’ve had with Portlanders about Portland music has been predominantlyabout what artists and their audiences wear and how they behave instead of *what they’re trying to say*.There’s nothing inherently wrong with leaving things petty, lyrically and choosing to remain content withestablished sounds, musically, as long as your work is advertised as **entertainment, not performance**.

Before I came Northwest, my fiancé had been exposing me to a variety of its music, which I mostly toleratedpolitely. Dozens of albums and EPs were played through once and forgotten forever, but when I arrived at [ademo tape](http://thecigaretteburns.bandcamp.com/album/demos-2015) recorded by her long time friend’sband, [*The Cigarette Burns*](https://thecigaretteburns.bandcamp.com/), I finally heard something familiar,yet vitally compelling: pissed off punks having fun. That said, I should admit that I only attended Saturday’sshow because he was on the ticket, and I’m still glad I did. 
After what felt like hours of drowsy corn cob pipes, Christmas sweaters, and old sweethearts at fifty beatsper minute (there were literally two young men sleeping within 15 feet of the bands for the duration,) Rickysat himself on a stool in the midst of Kaplow’s sprawling gear load at 2:30AM with only his guitar and hisvoice. Unfortunately, I’d squandered the Nikon’s batteries on Californians (the lighting was not idealanyway,) so I thought I’d share [his set on Periscope](https://www.pscp.tv/AsphaltApostle/1gqxvXNPRaBGB?t=5s). Though Ricky had been patiently present andattentive for the entire night (unlike myself,) those who were left of the entertainers bolted to the porch fora lively discussion about unicycles and quinoa while Ricky told us about hate, jealousy, and feeling like shit ina somber elegy. Any further adjectives may edge dangerously close to a half-assed “concert review,” which Iam *not* yet qualified for, but I will say that Ricky’s sincerity made him most engaging part of the night,and his frustrated, conclusive nod to The Cigarette Burns was the first *real* punk sounds I’ve yet heard in
Portland. 
![Indie Folk Battery Burglary](https://i.snap.as/hNtIUA6.jpg) 
I realize sharing this small experience does little to grow the conversation, but this isn’t a magazine, and **Iam desperate for answers** about the bizarre reality in which I find myself. [When Ricky dedicated a songto Courtney Love](https://youtu.be/zJONjVnDADI?t=1050), one of the male musicians(?) yelled “CourtneyLove fuckin’ killed Kurt Cobain!” which was *such* an unbelievably cliché happening/decision that I’ll surelyspend the rest of my days in this city unsuccessfully attempting to work it out, aloud. I can’t quite recall whoit was last Fall that responded to my frustration by challenging “what if there’s nothing to understand?”While this may be a reasonable conclusion, I suspect it’s not one I could accept as long as I remain herewithout losing my mind. If Portland is truly the dimensionless bastion of apathy and intellectual stagnancy foryoung Americans, I must *blog my way out it* as soon as possible (for Pete’s sake, just give these kidssome antidepressants,) but I’d still like to believe the idea too oxymoronic to actually exist.

Before Extratone, there was Inmunis. – my first, relatively short-lived attempt to launch an online magazine
which wasn’t particularly important, but the experience surely did contribute to and inform my progression inunderstanding media that led to my (utter bewildered) current state. Anyhow, it’s fun to look back. Here’sthe web archive’s last snapshot. 
![Inmunis Version 1 Web Capture](https://i.snap.as/K5yflMu.jpeg) 
This, a derelict Twitter account, and two film reviews by James Wilson are all that’s left of inmunis.co.uk for
good reasons – many of which I did not entirely shed when I tried again. Until I started Extratone and madedoing “this” – incessantly reading/exploring the web, obsessively tinkering and experimenting with TheExtranet – I actually had very little knowledge on or exposure to the state of digital publishing or the real
depth of variety to be found with any significant effort to comprehend the current offering real, surviving
magazines, online or not, yet was dumb and arrogant enough to assume that I’d seen it all and none of it
was even close to good enough for me to read or seek to write for. I was actually delusional enough to
regard myself as too smart and one-of-a-kind to lower myself by going back to journalism school – that I
was so special, anything I put effort in creating was destined to turn out superb. Granted, I’d had the actualidea for less than two weeks before I experienced by far the most traumatic, soul-destroying, world-upturning, and life-altering event of my entire existence, which I think accounts for the insanity, and all ofmy decisions were inevitably preempted by the fact that I was a 21-year-old straight white male communitycollege dropout, which accounts for (but does not excuse) their absurdity. 
I’ve publicly implied before that it was probably only thanks to Drycast – which was also in its infancy duringthe time of The Big Event (episode 7 was published just two days before) – and its weekly obligation to sitdown and talk with my favorite people about interesting stuff that I did not end up dead or institutionalized
in 2015 (I wish I was exaggerating.) If there is a Gourd, let it be known that he is fully up-to-date and
brand-activated – he sent me a fucking podcast to save my life. 
Reading and compiling stories for the show notes throughout the week provided an early avenue forexploring and embedding myself into media. Beyond the actual content, even, it’s been the rationality in thetone which journalists generally adhere to that has drawn me in and provided a brighter and brighter guidinglight to help keep my sanity in check after my world ended because New Media values empathy in tandemwith critical thought. All my life, it’s been very important to me that I continue to learn the best way to both
appear and feel smart and functional. I’ve long since accepted that I am very fucking weird – and not in the
wow, I dye my hair bright red sort of way which helps people feel unique, but in the holy shit, I’m terrified ofwhat would actually result in losing control of my facade sort, which is actually much less sinister than itsounds for you, and infinitely moreso for me. 
This is why I still have a very infantile habit of becoming overwhelmingly frustrated with those who socially
emphasize and celebrate their “weirdness” as an important part of their identity because my self-perception
has long since transitioned from regarding my deviations as something that made me “unique,” to giganticobstacles in the way of every possible aspiration which I’ll probably never overcome, but am doomed to killmyself trying. I’m now working on learning to appreciate those very fucking common people who aredetermined to prove how strange they are because ultimately, my own self-perception is just as ignorant,loneliness is not a virtue, and I’ve only maintained the whole charade because I’d rather have delusions ofgrandeur than acknowledge that I am also mostly unoriginal, and most of my truly more “original” behaviors could easily be described as simply unhealthy. 
This is an important confession for this explanation because its “solution” is another crucial motivation
behind my creation of Extratone – as both a symbolic and literal means of understanding and minimizing my
own biases and bitterness by 1) surrounding myself with the huge amount young, talented people I knewwith great ideas and 2) editorially committing to curiosity as the most precious ideal in writing (and in life.) 
I do know that – for whatever reason – I really do have a special knack for identifying the culture and
creators that are truly fresh, innovative, even cool among those who can’t comprehend or stand it and the
heartbreaking number of those who actualize themselves by trying to act aggressively apathetic toward the
status quo. This sense is far from 100% reliable and is certainly not of a greater quality than everyone on
Earth, but I would still confidently suggest it’s at least better than most, and – as most of us know – itespecially jives with and defines the world of magazines. 
As I did in Spring 2016, I still believe that Extratone is the best way for me to hone my greatest talents and
shed my biggest problems – that it is the name I can place on my endless journey to improve myself, which
– most importantly of all – will all the while achieve the tightest possible adhesion to the only meaning of
“original” with any significance or real world value at all, which serves human curiosity without punishing it in
any sense. I could actually just be crazy or completely, irrationally inverted – and I know it sounds abstractand preposterous – but I promise it’s my best shot at one day performing my optimal function for the world. 
The very first thing I did after I’d arrived upon these hypotheses and been abruptly forced to cling to themas my last hope in life was to obsessively search for a single mantra/battlecry I could drill into my memory
and could shout under duress – including the temptation to escape the whole lot of it – to succinctly remind
myself that I had at least one logical chance at a fulfilling life (and yes, it’s still funny that the chance is, infact, a Web Site.) 
Scribam quid non legerim is possibly grammatically incorrect to a scholar, but it’s the best possibletranslation I came up with in my Latin research of “I will write what I have not read.” It’s cheesy, yes, and abit cringey in the middle of just any old day when it happens to catch my eye where it’s proudly displayed,
all-caps, in the footer of our CMS, and – I’ll be honest – I don’t know if I could explain it over coffee to astranger without turning red and covering my face, as I once could, but it’s (sincerely, in this one .case) real
gravestone material. (As in, if someone were to read this after my death, they would be encouraged toreceive it as a bonafide last wish.)

# iOS 10's Speed Is Justification Enough 
## Big Boy; Big Phone still in effect, words on next Tuesday's update from a withering old man. 
Thanks to this week's September 2016 Keynote, we now know that iOS 10 will be officially released in just three days. I suppose it was a bit silly of me to download the [public beta](http://www.imore.com/how-to-download-ios-10-public­beta) so late in the game, but I did, and regret it *much* less than I could've imagined. 
I've used my rose gold iPhone 6S Plus more than any personal device I've ever owned. For the first time in my functioning life, I've had no persistent need for a laptop, which is a pretty big deal for reasons you couldn't care less about. 
Ownership of my first generation iPhone trained me to dread new releases. Expectedly, it got less and less usable every time Stevie took the stage. For relevance's sake, I decided to opt in a bit early, despite my assumption that my 6S Plus would show its first signs of struggle as a result. 
Immediately, though, the opposite effect was noticeable. Everything is faster: notifications, app opening/closing, intra-app function, and *text entry,* even. Smoother, too - so much so, it's almost a shame we've had to use iOS 9 on these devices for a whole year. The effect of such smoothing on my perception should be kept in consideration when reading the rest of my opining. 
**Raise to wake** is less tedious/more useful than I anticipated, though it's been briefly mistriggered a few times in transit from inside my Moshi Overture Wallet Case (an extraordinary product, by the way,) but it should be noted that I walk and carry my phone rather strangely. With relatively default sleep/wake settings, I did not notice enough mistriggering to have quantifiable power consequences. 
**Messages** is appropriately-complex for the times, now, if that makes sense. The pressure to "compete" with Snapchat, Facebook Messenger, What'sApp, etc. is understandable, but the execution of their reply is not. For me, at least, there is simply nothing to add to SMS. Its role is purely functional. I wasn't able to try out many of the new features. Not just because nobody else had iOS 10, but because - critically - I could not think of someone I'd be willing to bother with useless garbage like... a doodle. And even if I could've, it's probably actually *less* trouble to use one of those third-party applications in that Application Shop Apple has been so proud of for so long. For old people like me, even cleverly stowed buttons for unused features are *still buttons*. It feels an awful lot like an obligatory alteration, not a visionary one, and it's a shame that Apple's losing its awareness of the appropriate time for one, the other, or neither. 
I feel like competence in coverage of Apple is heavily dependent upon the ability to differentiate between the allure of an intelligently blingy feature and the allure of an intelligently functional one. Crude, I know, but ever more essential. **Contextual predictions** are impressive and surprisingly-clever. It's encouraging to see progress in such simple interactions, but - be honest with yourself - making use of it is actually going to cost you time in the majority of cases. Hate to be excessively meta here, but keep in mind - again - that I am not the majority. I tend to type things out... It's my thing. If this is completely obscuring my vision of any of these features' uselessness, *please* take the time to add to the discussion in the comments. Discourse is the handiest security in such matters. 
I've loved 3D Touch all along, even though something like 75% of the time, I've been triggering it unintentionally. It's *very* useful for quickly grabbing web images, but I'm probably more of a thief than you'll ever be. Mostly, I just like the sensation. The curt vibration and brittle illusion of a third interactive dimension have provided more functionality than... its actual functionality. With **touch and go**, though, I can instantly conjure a concise summary of the current local weather conditions, *and* a singular story from Apple News. Though I'm undoubtedly going to need to make a conscious effort to remember to use them, anything's a plus when one's affection was already so irrational. 
As to **Apple News** itself... It's just not the same application. The "For You" roll was amusingly messy before but actual structure (read: functional aggregation) has killed some of its beauty, I'm afraid. It is *so* much faster, though. 
We'll actually have to take it seriously, now. 
I haven't gotten the opportunity to really use **rich notifications** yet, but I can't imagine them *actually* making anything much faster. Perhaps singularly, I've always found my unconscious navigation to a given application itself to be quick enough to consistently glance over "no, you don't have to leave the app" features. 
I suspect the ability to **search photos by content** will be iOS 10's most useful addition for myself. A few trials demonstrate that it can differentiate between "nightfall" and "night," and "clothed" and "nude." (I have never been naked.) It's the most intriguing, too, because it means more nuanced & controversial search parameters are just a few years away. Search by expression? Even search by *emotion.* I can't wait until Apple gets to wrestle with the perceived difference between peace and apathy within an algorithmic context. 
"Please define 'joy,' Mr. Ives."

# iOS 14's Anxious Destiny 
![iOS 14 Custom Homescreen Collage](https://i.snap.as/WPcTLhJP.jpg) 
It is my privilege and my curse to write about every new major iteration to Apple’s mobile operating system,though I skipped iOS 13 last year, which was largely dominated by Dark Mode, the iPad OS fork, and Memoji
– which I could care less about, honestly – and didn’t warrant my investment in a Full Post, I felt. ThePhotos app improvements were very welcome, but I’d departed from iCloud as my primary storage service,so I didn’t have anything relevant to say. iOS 14 is also mostly irrelevant to my own personal use, butrepresents a more abstract shift in design philosophy that I thought was worth commenting on. For myself,everything about it adds anxiety, beginning with the launch, itself, at [Apple’s WWDC 2020](https://youtu.be/GEZhD3J89ZE), which I watched, live, and [Tweeted extensively about](https://twitter.com/i/events/1275137514609823751?s=20). 
## I do not want to live on the Memoji planet. 
My technology writing over the years has largely centered around my awe and confusion regarding what I'veperceived as a divergent path from the future I once imagined. My closest guess as to this divergence'sorigin is the announcement of iOS7, with Apple's [abandonment of skeuomorphic design](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/shortcuts/2013/jun/12/skeuomorphism-apple-ditched-ios7) infavor of an entirely new, "flatter" UX visual language, which I actually found quite jarring. [In retrospect](https://snap.as/extratone/retrospective), though, of course I'm glad they did so. I thought this was animportat preface to any thoughts I have about [today's WWDC Keynote](https://youtu.be/GEZhD3J89ZE) ­they will probably seem idiotic in a year or so (they might to you already.) 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i243Fn1HwOY 
Thanks to The Big Beer Virus, this was Apple's first pre-recorded WWDC presentation (though the word "live"continued to be used on several occasions,) which made it especially surreal. During the wait for the Keynoteto "go live," the stream was occupied by an [animated Earth](https://twitter.com/GoncaloCdM/status/1275110234000969728) from orbit. As the clock rolled over thehour's top, AURORA's "[Daydreamer](https://song.link/us/i/1457598185)" faded in and we began to growcloser to this Earth, gradually revealing that it was covered with millions of floating memoji in various statesbehind their animated MacBooks. Like much of the event to follow, this scene became more and more anxiety-inducing as we grew closer to the mob (keep in mind that I've never really found memoji cute, unlikeplenty of folks.) Eventually, we changed pitch dramatically and plunged through a hole in the clouds straighttoward the incenter of the spaceship at Apple Park, through the door, down the staircase, and into acompletely empty - but fully lit - Steve Jobs theatre, where Tim Cook emerged on stage and almostimmediately began to [address racism](https://www.inputmag.com/tech/apple-wwdc-virtual-event-tim-cook­addresses-black-lives-matter-racism). 
https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/1275178772921270275 
This disorganization of [Craig Federighi's Homescreen](https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/1275178772921270275) shown in the presentation exemplifies theentire aura of this update: it’s complicated. _The Verge_’s Dieter Bohn receives this new complicationpositively in an [excellent essay](https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/24/21299924/ios-14-iphone-wwdc­2020-apple-home-screen-widgets-app-library-clips-pages-complexity) dedicated to the topic, divided into**Widgets on The Home Screen**, **Jiggle Mode** and **Editing Pages**, the **App Library**, and**App Clips**. (Yes, in many ways, linking to the essay makes this post redundant.) 
That's what I wrote about WWDC. iOS 14 officially released five days ago, now, and folks are alreadyshowcasing some crazy homescreen modifications on Twitter in [#ios14homescreen](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23ios14homescreen&src=typeahead_click&f=image). I would go into detail, but I'm honestly not all that curious about the process, which is unusual. I hope more than anything that Iam not loosing my curiosity or playfulness regarding iOS which not so long ago propelled [an exuberantexploration of Shortcuts' capabilities](https://bilge.world/siri-shortcuts-ios12-review) during their early daysas an integrated Apple property with the release of iOS 12. 
https://twitter.com/ragulover123/status/1307461503948394496 
Basically, I'm not going to do the full bit, this year, but I'd like to address some of the notes I _did_ takethroughout the past few months of the developer beta. Notably, there is simply far less to iOS 14 that'srelevant to my life, personally, than any other release I remember, _but that's okay_. It's just a wee bit moredifficult to motivate myself to talk about it. If there's one definite statement to be made about this release,it's that **it is _additive_ rather than _transformative_**. As Dieter Bohn so elequently put it for _TheVerge_: 
> For the iPhone, the overarching theme is that they're finally letting it get complicated. The home screenstarts simple, but it can be complex if you want it to and Apple's also finally putting different elements on topof other elements so you can see Siri on top of your current screen instead of taking over the whole screen.> > "[iOS and iPadOS 14 public beta preview: something for everybody](https://www.theverge.com/21317904/ios-ipados-14-public-beta-preview-scribble-home-screen-widgets­apple-maps)" | _The Verge_ 
_Yes, I do find the title of that article quite ironic considering what I just articulated to you._ 
The title of [his penultimate review](https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/24/21299924/ios-14-iphone-wwdc­2020-apple-home-screen-widgets-app-library-clips-pages-complexity), additionally, includes the summation"Apple is finally lettting the iPhone homescreen get complicated." Yes... _Complexity_. I'll be honest: I'veactually had the opportunity to play around quite a bit with Android 11 thanks to Android Studio on my PCs,and I found it tremendously underwhelming as an alternative. On a virtual Pixel 3, the experience wasfunctionally no more than a fucking _material design_\-tasting, _slightly_ varied execution of a smartphoneoperating system in comparison. I should disclaim, though, that these weeks with early iOS widgetimplementation - which represents quite a hefty chunk of this release's significance, I think we can all agree
-have led me to the conclusion that I personally _do not believe_ in widgets. Or at least - I do not have theusership vocabulary to even begin integrating them into my own handset-using life.\[efn\_note\]I'delaborate but honestly, who cares, really?\[/efn\_note\] 
To focus a bit, let's look specifically at a _Gizmodo_ article published this past Wednesday: "[17 Things YouCan Do in iOS 14 That You Couldn’t Do Before](https://gizmodo.com/17-things-you-can-do-in-ios-14-that­you-couldn-t-do-bef-1844975020):" 
1.
 **App Clips**: Oh boy... I'm so physically, mentally, and spiritually exhausted. Just gonna say _no_ tothat one. 

2.
 **Add widgets to the home screen**: I'm going to assume it's Android users who've stigmatised dynamichome screen widgets as a desirable outlet of development resources. I simply cannot fathom any bit of datawhich would be truly be _constructively_ consumed there, as opposed to unlocking the device andnavigating to whatever application it originated from. Perhaps I'm just old and slow.

3.
 **Send apps to the App Library**: Directly related, actually. Still considering how I assume most folksactually navigate to applications that have been in folders or in secondary+ homescreens to date - that is,dragging down and typing a handful of characters into Spotlight search - I'm not sure an alphabetized listingof all apps is really that useful. I know I'm not alone on this one: iJustine expressed an identical assumption[on an episode of her podcast, _Same Brain_](https://anchor.fm/samebrain/episodes/WWDC-Rumors--PS5­hype-and-Animal-Crossing-efmf8f).

4.
 **Hide some of your home screens**: (I repeat the exact same argument.)

5.
 **Watch videos with picture-in-picture mode**: Once again, I could definitely be showing my age, butwhat really constitues _watching_ when you're talking about a fractional segment of a ~6 inch display? Youmay as well just be listening to the audio, right?

6.
 **Pin conversations in Messages**: I'm afraid the text conversation pinning feature doesn't really apply to 

someone like myself, who literally never messages anyone but my girlfriend and my mom. All pinning theconversations accomplishes for me is the obfuscation of the handy in-line timestamp found in the normal listview. 

7.
 **Mention your contacts in Messages**: Jesus... And we're still using fucking _SMS_?

8.
 **Add more variety to your memojis**: I still have not figured out how to actually use memojies,practically, so...

9.
 **Get suggested smart home automations**: I'm sorry... What did you say? I'm not familiar with thosewords. 

10.
 **Get to bed on time**: Clarification: "iOS 14 works with watchOS 7 (or on its own) to help you get tosleep at the right time each night, with reminders and Do Not Disturb options." If you were truly _at all_interested in not being disturbed _or_ getting lots of sleep, you wouldn't have spent $300 on a machine tostrap to your wrist who's **primary function** is to disturb you!

11.
 **Translate websites in Safari**: Christ... _Really_? How have I not encountered an issue with thisbefore? 

12.
 **Search inside apps**: **There we go!** The first item on this list that suggests anyone at Apple_actually uses iOS_!

13.
 **Get more detailed weather forecasts**: Dark Sky acquision... All this one does is remind me thatApple's self-restraint could breach at any time and essentially the only competent mobile weather app everdevised could die or be molested into irrelevance. 

14.
 **Use your iPhone as a translator**: Well... Yeah... Anything that convenienctly allows me to reducedependence on Google, I guess!

15.
 **Get more facts from Siri**: ..._lol_ 

"Apple says Siri knows more facts than ever before, though it hasn’t offered up any specific examples ofsomething it knows in iOS 14 that it didn’t know in iOS 13—you’ll have to try and test it out yourself.According to Apple, Siri now knows 20 times the number of facts that it did three years ago, and we haven’tbeen able to catch it out with anything so far."

16.
 **Get cycling directions in Apple Maps**: No! Cut that out!

17.
 **Plan a journey in an electric vehicle**: I'm not joking when I suggest that this fits perfectly into iOS14's _Anxiety Mode Enchancement_ theme: all this really means is _We've added the new Apple RangeAnxiety app_! 


[David Blue's Guide to Columbia, Missouri](https://davidblue.wtf/columbiaguide) renders surprisinglybeautifully on a desktop browser. 
Yes, there _are_ examples of genuine progress. The Guides feature in Maps (seen above) probablycould/should have been added a long time ago, but at least Apple executed it quite elegantly. I'm could've_sworn_ sharing your ETA has been possible from within Maps since like... iOS 7 or something, but perhaps Iwas thinking of [Waze](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/waze-navigation-live-traffic/id323229106).**Wallpapers for CarPlay** are one of those features that didn’t occur to me to want, but I did/do. Also ­though my personal experience with CarPlay has been limited - I can definitely imagine more layout options(“Horizontal status bar”) will be useful in _fringe_ use cases. 
And that's it! All of my notes have now been crossed off! Now I can finally forget I ever spent time thinkingabout iOS this year... Gourd Bless.

# Through an iPhone 4's Lens 
![Through an iPhone 4's Lens](https://i.snap.as/7wrQ9DPN.jpg) 
## Seven years ago, the fourth generation of Apple’s iPhone instigated a change in our perception of digitalphotography. Now – thanks to Google Photos – I’d like to reflect on my favorite shots of mine. 
When iPhone 4 handsets began shipping in the Summer of 2010, I’d been carrying my first generation forthree solid years – since its now history-stricken release, in fact – and its age started to become a problem.I’d drop it screen-down on a rock in the airport parking lot just before going back to school for my Junioryear, splitting a crack in the screen that wouldn’t quite kill it – it was the demands of iOS 4 on its 412 MHzCPU and meager 128 MB of RAM that would ultimately cease its usability. 
<iframe width="auto" height="auto" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fJOMiTeDERY?controls=0&amp;start=60" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe> 
The single 2 megapixel rear-facing camera would surprise one at times, but was never lauded as anythingbut what it was – a mobile phone-bound sensor capturing very cellular-looking* images, but Steve Jobswasn’t [three minutes in](https://youtu.be/z__jxoczNWc?t=2m10s) to his iPhone 4 presentation at the June2010 Worldwide Developer’s Conference before he pronounced the design’s closest possible “kin” to be “anold Leica camera,” associating his device with photography in its first impression. The equivalent of the firstgeneration’s rear-facing camera could now be found facing *you*, and the fourth’s primary sensor now shotat 5 megapixels (2592 x 1936) with autofocus and 5x digital zoom, setting a fundamental smartphone sensorconfiguration [standard](https://www.theverge.com/2014/9/9/6125849/iphone-history-pictures) that’s stilladhered to by the industry. 
After unleashing Google Photos upon the ~15,000 images on my home machine’s hard drive last year, Ihave been constantly reminded of my own photographic history – for better or worse – and regularly shownfive, six, seven-year old snaps in a manner that wouldn’t have been possible (or have made any sense)before. Recently, I was astounded to find that I took many of the better shots with my iPhone 4, so Ithought I’d share a few from my high-school days in loving memory of my trusty little rectangularcompanion.

# The Precarious Legacy of the iPhone 8 
![iPhone 8 Plus and Dave](https://i.snap.as/tq2eUGT.jpg) 
## A decade of iPhone has probably ruined my life, but will the 8 Plus finally end it? 
*Is my True Tone bullshit on?* 
“True Tone” is so forgettable, everybody had to mention it first. Quite simply, it uses an ambient light sensorto fiddle with white balance, warming the colors of the display as an immediately-obvious whole, yes, but aninteresting contrast to show off is no longer inherently justified in being called a “feature” in Apple products,anymore. Essentially, no matter who you ask (aside from [Jon Rettinger](https://youtu.be/AXU8GqaMsQc?t=7m23s),) you *should not* buy an iPhone 8, though I did last Fall, not only because I had to suddenly
decide on a handset in less than 24 hours, but — if anything — to say goodbye to the form, the operating
system, and the tech company which I have depended upon and carried with me virtually every day for myentire adult life. I’d originally decided to abandon this review due to a variety of unexpected circumstances,but Apple and its iPhone have maintained their place in the news with their [battery scandal](https://www.apple.com/iphone-battery-and-performance/), and a third of a year with the 8 Plus hasincluded some experiences which warrant a send-off before iOS 12 is released, making it (and myself) totallyirrelevant forever. 
As the longstanding benchmark of the smartphone industry’s state at any given time, the iPhone can be easyto reflect upon as a product once occupying a state of universal exemption from criticism, but it has, in fact,[never been so](http://theweek.com/articles/459748/7-reviews-original-iphone-from-2007). As Nilay Patel[noted](https://www.theverge.com/2017/9/19/16323570/apple-new-iphone-8-review-plus-2017), one mightregard the 8 as the last compromise of “basically four years” of the same design. Since launch, it’s
unsurprisingly stayed a wee bit too far behind on the spreadsheets for most Android-type folks — not that
I’ve ever believed them truthfully incapable of comprehending what it means to *package* a product, given
where their greasy startups all eventually ended up. (**You cannot doubt me** — I once took a year-long
sabbatical from iOS with a [Sony Xperia Play](https://youtu.be/nSWgS0l0kc8), and my authority is absolute.)The rest are trying to decide whether or not to pay $200 more for “[the phone of the future](https://www.wsj.com/articles/iphone-8-apples-middle-child-1505322945),” which knows when you’rewatching it, and is only good for playing half an hour of stupid video games before it needs a charge. 
So far, I have maintained that my first generation iPhone was the best handset of all time — one hell of anEmail Machine that lasted me close to five years — throughout the last two with actual motherboard exposed
to the elements in the corner of its cracked screen. That said, who knows how it’d feel to be coerced intousing “iPhone OS 2” as it was called, then, for an entire workday in 2018? Two years prior to bringing homean 8 Plus, I [vowed](http://bit.ly/drycast47) that my 6S Plus would be my last ever Apple device, but thisone *actually* feels like a last hurrah. Though the ability to *Tweet directly from the swipe-down notificationmenu* is still nowhere to be found (it’s been gone for 5 releases, now, and would seem to have beenforgotten by *literally* everyone but myself,) one gets the sense that Apple’s efforts to add to the iPhone 8and iOS 11 were to make amends with us by settling a few debts. 
In part, they did. Native apps got a major overhaul — including Mail, which was startling, considering that I’d
been looking at what was near as makes no difference the same UI my eldest phone shipped with. As aresult, it alone constitutes my benchmark for an email service, and I have been left without a clue as to what*a good one* looks like. (Apparently it was [really bad](https://www.pcmag.com/article/342889/the-best­mobile-email-client-apps)?) Since time began, there has always been at least one alternative email app ofthe moment that tech journos refer to as the must-have, end-all replacement. [Edison Mail](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/email-edison-mail/id922793622?mt=8) is currently the smoother, faster,
most modular option — at least for another few minutes– but I’ll never know it as I know Mail, and I’ll never
want to. Playing around with experimental email apps is too scary. What if I decide once again to kill thatmassive number in the red badge and need to immediately mark 40,000 emails as read? It took all of my
iPhone 4’s 1.0Ghz CPU and proprietary software over 18 hours — how am I supposed to trust a shabby little
6-month-old startup with such an important task? Anybody with a hundred bucks can make an app, you know. 
### Why is the App Store now the best-looking publishing software on iOS? 
One might interpret the App Store’s redesign as an attempt by Apple to control this conversation — of both
the trending *new thing* and the old“essentials” that you’ve probably had tucked away in an untouchedfolder for years. Technically, whoever the hell is writing those gorgeously-presented daily bits has madethem a publishing company, though I’m not so sure I’m not the last remaining user who’s continued semi-
regularly visiting their “Today” section. If I *did* want to actually read about apps (I don’t — who does?) it
wouldn’t make much sense to seek critical reviews from the faceless boffins behind the platform itself,regardless of how much better it may look than all of the tech news sites, paywall or no. 
Native screen recording could conceivably come in handy once or twice, but I see no reason why the red barmust remain at the top of the render, but it has, which could explain the total lack of any such video in the
wild. Front-facing 4K, 60fps capture is impressive, but useless — vloggers all have GoPros or DSLRs, these
days, and sharing through Snapchat and Instagram will always be ultra-compressed. (Here are two sloppy
test clips — [at the zoo](https://youtu.be/VnfkWkotGFw), and [fishing](https://youtu.be/KOs5m6ynKAI).) 
Perhaps some have figured out the new Files “app,” but it’s sat on my homescreen for months, untapped,
and it will likely remain there for all time as a sort of soothing trophy — a thanks for my legacy iPhone loyalty.
My reward for half a lifetime of syncing, scrolling, and tolling? **I can now view some of the files on myMobile Computing Device**, and even *scan documents in*, which is mostly novel (though it is fun todigitize excerpts from physical text.) At some point, I must’ve mischecked a permanent option because allfile types now open only in an app that does not recognize them. God bless. 
![Roof Photo](https://i.snap.as/fuMs1a4.jpg) 
Somehow, I’ve managed to fill my social circle with precisely zero iOS-using folks. All of my friends andcolleagues use Android devices (including [Tim’s supercool Nextbit Robin](https://soundcloud.com/extratonemagazine/nextbit),) which provide a few handy datapoints (like thecamera in [my fiance’s Galaxy S8](https://flic.kr/p/BXruaL),) but deprive me of any significant experiencewith the ostensibly intoxicating cult of iMessage. I’m constantly listening to and reading tech writers claimthat it’s [one of the only reasons they’re still using iPhones](https://www.theverge.com/2016/10/10/13225514/apple-iphone-cant-switch-pixel-android-imessage­addiction), but my own food-OS loving biome has forced me to find others, and frankly, I can’t imaginelooking at the [*gluttonous*](http://www.extratone.com/audio/futureland/toomanymessengers/) palate ofavailable mobile, cross-platform messaging services (Telegram, [now Telegram X](https://telegram.org/blog/telegram-x), WhatsApp, Signal, Snapchat, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Discord,
Slack, *Tinder?*, Google Hangouts, Google Allo, Google Chat, Viber, Skype, Line, Wire, etc.) and thinking…
*well, none of this will do*! 
Honestly — even if I’d actually been at all informed in my haste, the photographic capabilities of the 8 Plus,alone would’ve sold it. It’s not the new filters, gif functionality, or even “3D Photos” — it’s those mythical dual
12MP sensors (which it shares with something called the iPhone X.) They’re no less than infallible. After fourmonths of [astonishing captures](http://bit.ly/ip8plus)in all manner of conditions, I don’t even care how
exactly they do it anymore — it’s better to be left marveling. This first example was taken at Keystone,Colorado in the middle of a dark, cloudy Fall night — the amount of light they were able to find — “up to 80%more,” [according to Apple](https://www.apple.com/apple-events/september-2017/) — is just *impossible*. 
*The vast majority of the samples in my iPhone 8 Flickr Album were taken within the native Camera app as itships and left unedited. (Especially before just a few weeks ago, when I [discovered Halide](https://extratone.com/race-day-at-hodges).* 
![Oregon Coast - iPhone 8 Plus](https://i.snap.as/C2LLJAl5.jpg) 
Here is an unquestionably sensible progression from which iPhone has never wavered far since its fourthgeneration [set the standard](http://www.extratone.com/words/inred/iphone4/), but it’s one of an unfortunate few. Siri is still useless and silly apart from its “disable all alarms” feature and its ability to sounditself off in response when you’re hysterically screaming and digging for it through the vast plush of a forty­year-old Lincoln. The customizable Control Center makes toggling low power mode, orientation lock, Wi-Fi,and Bluetooth less frustrating (note the last two [aren’t quite hard switches](https://www.wired.com/story/how-to-turn-off-wifi-and-bluetooth-in-ios11/),) though it should’ve comeyears ago. Notifications are slightly more sensible -certainly better than they were on Android Gingerbread,but I’ve heard things’ve changed quite a bit since then. 
I *have* been tripped up by the lack of a 3.5mm audio jack a few times, but it just [wouldn’t make sense](http://www.extratone.com/words/inred/mono/) from a hardware perspective, and the new external stereocapability should refute those who can’t or won’t understand. Yes, it would be nice if Apple hadn’t led the
industry to quite such a compromising obsession with thinness — we’d all trade *a lot*of substance forexponentially greater battery life, storage capacity, water resistance, etc. — but I don’t see much sense inexpending your energy holding up signs in Silicon Valley. 
> I’ll be here long after you’ve died, and you know why?> Because I took the time to sync my apps. 
Two years ago, a new generation of social apps and the preposterous notion of a quad-core CPU in myiPhone 6S Plus seemed like the harbinger of a world I no longer understood. Now, most of those serviceshave expanded to the far boundaries of my reach, and I’ve stopped counting chips. Refinement of thehardware design is reverent to the extreme. It’s pretentious, but Apple’s decision to pause on the 8 toconsider details like stuffing the legal text in the software and adding a little bit of weight *back in* forergonomics’ sake leads one to regard it as a monument to all the devices along the development timeline
that have led to this… last triumph. Or, it would have perhaps, had they not [sold so many]
(https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2018/02/apple-reports-first-quarter-results/). 
One could argue that good execution of consumer electronic design means minimizing as much as possiblethe obstructions in the way of the user completing any given task, and the iPhone 8 Plus has surpassed the
vast majority of these for myself — and I am, surely, a “power user.” iOS has changed a lot in the decade I’veemployed it — in far too many ways for the worse — but this pair of handset and software have reached *my*
imagination’s limit for what I could possibly want to do. Augmented reality and wireless charging won’t everhave a place in my future, for better or worse. Face ID is much too peculiar. Surely, this iPhone is theultimate expression of the first and fourth generation’s foundation. 
If the 6S Plus was indeed the key to my immortality, I’m afraid the 8 Plus heralds my imminent demise.Whether or not it’s an early one is for you to decide. This *really is* my last iPhone.

# iPhone and Music: For Artists, Curators, and Enthusiasts 
![Music on iOS](https://i.snap.as/mTEozs2r.png) 
## Reporting from deep within the iOS cult on essential apps/methods for real-life music people. 
*Listen to this article read (with some bugs) by Siri Voice 3 below...* 
<audio controls>
 <source src="https://github.com/extratone/bilge/raw/main/audio/TTS/iPhone%20and%20Music%20­%20For%20Artists%2C%20Curators%2C%20and%20Enthusiasts%20TTS.mp3"></audio> 
As you may or may not be aware, I’ve spent all of my 2021 so far diving real deep into iOS, considering allthat has changed since “an iPod, a phone, an internet communicator.” I’ve tuned in to the output of explicitlyApple-adjacent publications both old (*MacRumors*, *Apple Insider*, *9to5 Mac*, etc,) and new (*AppleScoop*, *MacStories*,) which have all metamorphosed in huge, mostly-redeemable ways just as theirprimary subject has. I have my own pubescent stories of Mac occultism, but I do not consider myrelationship with the brand to be an essential part of my identity, as so many do and have. Apple, Inc’s storyis spectacular and infinitely-relevant so long as they remain “the most valuable company in the history of theworld,” as I so love to describe them. Like many of you, I’m sure, I am often compelled to bring up thehumongous contrasts in the historical context of the company - to scream infinitely many variations of theobservation that Apple was basically the fucking *indie*, premium-tier consumer tech manufacturer ownedby the Creative Class for the first half+ of their existence, and have somehow maintained that *ThinkDifferent*™ brand narrative as they have definitively become the Big Blue of their time. 
From my perspective, the responsibility for the wellbeing of this utterly-delusional, occasionally verydangerous sentiment actually lies fairly squarely on those of us who consider ourselves *better than all ofthat* because of our Debian workflows and their ancient command line utilities. (For the record, this is also100% delusional as things stand in 2021.) One thing I think we can all acknowledge, though, is that Apple’simage has been inextricably bound with *musicmaking*, throughout, far more than any other even remotelycomparable tech company. Naturally, the business still loves to bring this up all the time in big, glossygestures. The topical example of note would be the only worthwhile content I’ve yet to encounter on AppleTV+: [*Billie Eilish: The World’s a Little Blurry*](https://tv.apple.com/us/movie/billie-eilish-the-worlds-a­little-blurry/umc.cmc.5waz3hfo9r1133t8arap8b6nq), which documents the highlights of the young, belovedmusician’s prodigious ascension. For what it’s worth, I appreciate some special insights I gained thanks tothe film, which I do not actually consider at odds with the truth of its super on-brandness for Apple. 
An interesting take I found from 2017 from a new favorite voice on the *business* end of tech reporting:“[How Music Drowns Apple’s Innovation](http://thein.fo/8dba9a5022e1d273)” by *The Information*’sJessica Lessin portrays Apple’s relationship with music distribution and the music industry as a sort ofcompulsive distraction from its ambitions in serving video content, namely. Lessin points out the everpresentreminders of this obsession: 
> And so it is no wonder that Apple’s first forays into original video content fall under Apple Music. It’s worthnoting that the first series the company announced—“Carpool Karaoke” is literally about singing; “Planet ofthe Apps” features rapper Will.i.am as a judge. 
I think I can speak for the majority of my audience when I suggest that the targets of Lessin’s cynicismwould be more than welcome, if they were The Whole Truth. Indeed, the most valuable company in all ofhistory retaining an “emotional” attachment to the welfare of music creators might be described as*charming* or more. As is often the case on *The Information*, the comments from readers often offernoteworthy insight. In this case, Kevin Swint - who has apparently worked as an executive for both Appleand Samsung, according to [his profile](https://www.theinformation.com/contributors/458) on *TheInformation* - responded with an important consideration: “…it's possible that Apple's behavior aroundmusic has more to do with the company's overall tendency to stick with its past successes a bit too long rather than music really being a core part of its DNA.” 
In terms of business, that’s all I have to contribute, and I shall do my best not to evangelize Apple Music (ormore likely, disparage Spotify as one of the most destructive cultural forces of our time,) here. However, Iwould like to respond to a particular Jimmy Iovine quote from the original Apple Music announcement amidthe [2015 WWDC Keynote](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/apple-events-video/id275834665?i=1000430692668): 
> There needs to be a place where music can be treated less like digital bits and more like the art it is, witha sense of respect and discovery… and if that place could actually accommodate and support the artists whomake the music, not just the top-tier artists, but the kids in their bedrooms too, provide them all with ahome and a way to engage with their audiences, that would be pretty great. 
*Boy, this service Iovine describes sounds an awful lot like Bandcamp, no?* The suggestion that **Appleshould have purchased Bandcamp** is a very scary one, from my perspective, but I am reassured by thelikelihood that the notion did indeed occur to someone at Apple, Inc. at some point in the past, and wasquickly discarded, for whatever reason. I promise not to mention Bandcamp again in this Post, aside from itsown two iOS apps: for [listeners](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/bandcamp/id706408639) and for“[Artists/Labels](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/bandcamp-for-artists-labels/id1185670538)” ascreator/curator tools. 
I’m going to be focusing largely on the iPhone-bound experience, here, though I did borrow my mom’sMacBook Pro for a weekend to explore the state of music on MacOS and (accidentally) played around with[Apple Music on The Television](https://youtu.be/AazMEzHPN-0) (a surprisingly beautiful experience.) Onthat note, I’ll hurry up and get specific…

## AppsAssuming you’re already an Apple Music user, it’s very possible that you’ve been deprived of the “true”experience on the service provided by the variety of actively-developed but woefully-undercovered app storeentries that integrate directly with Apple Music. One of the most glaring discoveries I’ve made so far in myiOS deep dive, this year, has been the absolutely horrific state of Discovery on Apple’s App Store. If you’dthought to search the top charts under the store’s Music category, you wouldn’t find any of the gems I’mgoing to highlight, here. The credit for exposing me to their existence, in fact, lies with *MacStories* - ahard-hitting, well-established Apple-adjacent media company piloted by [Federico Viticci](https://twitter.com/viticci). At this very moment, their app-centric podcast, *App Stories*, is in the midst of[a special mini-series](https://appstories.net/episodes/212/) devoted to Music on iOS/Mac, from which thisPost draws upon heavily. For better or worse, they represent the definitive authority on this subject (amongmany others, naturally,) though I wouldn’t necessarily recommend their various publications be added to thereading lists of any but those most invested in iOS. 
![MusicHarbor on iPhone](https://i.snap.as/4agfF1nW.png) 
### [MusicHarbor](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/musicharbor-track-new-music/id1440405750) 
There is something uniquely concrete about a purely-chronological feed which we’ve lost in the past 5-10years in favor of algorithmic curation, generally. The [next item](https://bilge.world/tweetbot-6-ios-review)in _this_ particular feed, in fact, includes my attempt to explain why Twitter’s hard-chronological Listsfeature has sheltered me from the anxiety of the service’s main timeline, now ordered by proprietary (andobscured) formulas. I’d been aware of that dynamic in my own Twitter consumption for years, though. Icertainly did _not_ anticipate the impact of the music release equivalent of a chronological timeline asprovided by [**MusicHarbor**](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/musicharbor/id1440405750) - an app for iOS 
and MacOS that acts as a frontend for one’s music library across both Apple Music and Spotify. 
It's hard to remember how we (Apple Music) got here without embarking upon some gargantuan _AComplete Visual History of Apple Music_-like document, but it must be said that Tim Cook's "next chapter inmusic" has become a sad afterthought. As far as I understand it, the "streaming war" between Apple andSpotify has long since gone definitively to the latter in statistical terms, which I'd suggest to be an overallpositive outcome for Apple Music subscribers, generally. The self-perception within the heavy musicconsumer crowd of "niche," "underground," "obscure" cultural minority should - in theory - push those whobelieve themselves _destined to be different_ away from Spotify into the handy care of Apple, the absolutechampion of this particular self-deception. To be honest - though I write this for _all_ listeners, sincerely - Ihave found myself in a sort of utopian echo chamber of my own design in music culture terms. My days ofwaiting through 4+ hours of local openers before rap shows are far behind me, and I consume and engageexclusively with music I find personally redeemable. 
My Apple Music library has become quite fragmented after I lost my entire physical music collection alongwith the external drives containing my accumulated digital music library in 2017. Still, after more or lessstarting anew this past December and casually, deliberately adding digital files back into the accursed,ancient iTunes desktop application and restoring some (outdated) versions of my handful of shared curatorialplaylists thanks to SongShift (which we'll glance on later,) MusicHarbor currently lists 1433 artistsrepresented across my Apple Music and (very sparse) Spotify libraries. I know this because of [a very simpleSiri Shortcut](https://routinehub.co/shortcut/8935/) I modified which returns a text list of all Artists in one'sMusicHarbor library in Quick Look. ([Here is my result](https://gist.github.com/extratone/32763d8d2d6a71ab0fe4e045a6fb4441) as of this moment in GitHub Gistform.) According my App Store receipts, I first downloaded MusicHarbor on March 26 - 20 days ago - whichis mentionable because of how much I've accomplished with very minimal time investment in terms ofcurating my own music library thanks to MusicHarbor. As you'll note in the 3rd of the 4 screenshotsembedded above, I was able to delete System of a Down from my library - a single function which alonejustifies the app's one-time $5.99 "Unlock Everything" fee, to my sensibility. I've also been able to beginfollowing all the artists represented in a few of my favorite playlists with a handful of taps - a task whichwould literally require hours in the native Apple Music app of old (when one could actually follow artists,there.) On that note, it's time to cite the primary _MacStories_ article you should read, entitled "[How I KeepTrack of New Music Releases](https://www.macstories.net/ios/how-i-keep-track-of-new-music-releases/),"regarding Apple Music's performance as a release tracker: 
> The ‘New Releases’ section is tucked at the very end of the For You page and laid out as a horizontalcarousel that requires a lot of swiping; you can view the ‘New Releases’ page as a grid, which has sectionsfor different weeks, but, in my experience, it only aggregates highlights for new releases from some of myfavorite artists. The ‘New Music Mix’ playlist is not terrible, but it often comes loaded with stale data – songsI’ve already listened to multiple times and which shouldn’t qualify as “new” weeks after their original releasedate. Furthermore, I’ve found notifications for new releases for artists in my library unreliable at best: Ioccasionally get notifications for new albums, but never for new singles or EPs. 
Here, Federico Viticci is riffing off [a newsletter issue](https://chorus.fm/features/liner-notes-november-1st­2019/) written by music blogger Jason Tate, in which he describes the service's missing tracking functionalityas "the single most frustrating part of Apple Music." Though these points in the conversation are both almosttwo years old, MusicHarbor remains the ultimate means of tracking new music releases chronologically onApple's platforms. Though I am personally just three weeks in, the confidence this app has given me in thecertainty of its chronological release feed is quite profound. Its integration with one's calendar to track_upcoming_ releases is a bit much for my own needs, but I know personally enough invested curators forwhom it'd be a godsend to mark it no small addition. 
![MusicHarbor on MacOS](https://i.snap.as/UxLBTYvL.png) 
MusicHarbor’s only downside is entirely excusable/understandable, in context: it’s a bit clunky. For the sakeof this work, I set up [a shared Apple Music playlist](https://music.apple.com/us/playlist/musicharbor/pl.u­2aoq40vTaR0XmA) so I could further demonstrate all the new music I discovered in MusicHarbor. Addingwhole albums to this playlist with a single tap _feels_ powerful because it _is_ - I’ve no idea what sort of developer wizardry is involved in such an action, but the Wait Wheel doesn’t feel like too much to endure.Adding a release to one’s library - the other in-MusicHarbor accumulative function - is a bit quicker. It’simportant to remember that this piece of software was/is created and maintained by a single human being,though I would expect nothing but improvement, going forward. 
![Adding to MusicHarbor Playlist](https://i.snap.as/yN3nbcdR.png) 
That’s all I have to report on MusicHarbor, for the moment, but I’ll add further _MacStories_ praise fromtheir [2019 MacStories Selects](https://www.macstories.net/stories/macstories-selects-2019-recognizing-the­best-apps-of-the-year/#app-of-the-year-runner-up) app rewards: 
> What makes MusicHarbor special – and, ultimately, the reason why we all use the app here at MacStories
– is just how much developer Tanaka understands what someone who wants to know about new musicreleases is looking for. 
![Albums for iOS](https://i.snap.as/KylIYzaI.png) 
### [Albums](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/albums-album-focused-player/id1469948986) 
On the other end of the spectrum, exploring new digital manifestations of _The Music Collection_, is[Albums](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/albums-album-focused-player/id1469948986), which actuallyfunctions as an entire replacement frontend player for Apple Music. Reviewed [much more recently by_MacStories_](https://www.macstories.net/reviews/albums-4-0-a-must-have-app-for-music-lovers/), it reallyis best-described as “opinionated, favoring album playback over individual songs or playlists.” Consideringthat I installed the app just a week ago and have focused most of my attention on MusicHarbor in that time,I’ll leave most of the commentary to John Voorhees. All I can say, really, is that I see an extremely powerfulapplication, here, for a fairly specific use case: someone who’s listening is largely occupied by albums theyalready “own” in Apple Music and treasure deeply. The ability to set an individual record’s “Immersive UITint” down to the hex (in “Album Settings”) is as in-depth a tool of adoration as I’ve ever seen in a digitalmusic service. Combined with Albums’ presumptuous takeover of actual playback from the Apple Music app,I think I can rightfully say that it was built for the _extremely serious_ music consumer. 
My favorite part so far: the app knew well enough to offer me THE ZRO BUTTON. Telling, I think. 
![The ZRo Button - Albums App](https://i.snap.as/9pNf178x.jpeg) 
### Others 
Since it’s already quite clear how much this Post draws from _MacStories_, I’ll let [their review of Soor](https://www.macstories.net/reviews/soor-2-review-magic-mixes-and-release-alerts-elevate-the-beautiful­apple-music-client/) stand on its own (I couldn’t quite justify spending $6.99 just for review purposes.) Inthe episode embedded above, they also mention [Denim](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/denim-playlist­cover-maker/id1532250420) - a playlist cover creator I am not personally all that impressed with. There’salso MusicHarbor’s sibling, [MusicSmart](https://www.macstories.net/reviews/musicsmart-puts-the-spotlight­on-music-credits/), which manages the tricky but essential task of adding the metadata retrieval Apple Musicshould have included all along. The rest can be found in [the episode’s show notes](https://appstories.net/episodes/213/). I’m not done with them, but the rest are what I would differentiateas _services_…

### [Odesli/Song.Link](https://song.link/ivyhollivana) 
One of the bewilderingly undercovered digital music sharing tools of our kind, Odesli has been [my preferredmethod](https://twitter.com/search?q=song.link%2C%20%40neoyokel&f=live) of sharing tracks/albums/EPssince I first discovered it in 2018. It is _not_ specific to iOS but it _is_ **essential** for competent musicsharing, anywhere, these days, in its magical ability to _correctly_ intersect any given piece of music’s linksacross all streaming services, known and unknown. To be honest, I thought everybody would be using it bynow, but it’s continued to develop with [minimal attention](https://twitter.com/odesli_/status/1383100269320409095) aside from [Siri Shortcuts developers](https://www.notion.so/iOS-Shortcuts-0efaf0ef92c0467aa6fc201b78c8499e). Thanks to [Odesli’s Public API](https://www.notion.so/Public-API-d8093b1bb8874f8b85527d985c4f9e68), dozens of Music-centric SiriShortcuts have emerged over the past few years, resulting in one of the most useful Siri Shortcutsintegrations to be found for real, reasonable human beings. Here’s where Apple-adjacent media and I part ways… 
While current common conversation might point you to Federico Viticci’s [MusicBot hyper-Shortcut](https://www.macstories.net/ios/introducing-musicbot-the-all-in-one-apple-music-assistant-powered-by­shortcuts/) and/or @gianflo6’s 600 action-strong [Song.Link Shortcut](https://routinehub.co/shortcut/5134/),I (perhaps expectedly) would point you to [my own, 17-action Shortcut](https://routinehub.co/shortcut/8940/) which spares you any selections and simply opens the Song.Link URLof the track currently playing in Apple Music (while also copying said URL to the clipboard.) It’s not thatMusicBot isn’t massively impressive and still useful, but it represents a class of super/hyper-Shortcuts which(from my perspective) _far_-overreach beyond the intended use case for Siri Shortcuts and end upimmediately bewildering/alienating potential new users. Truthfully - as Federico singularly acknowledges ­they are full _applications_ built atop a less-than-ideal platform designed for relatively simple, _repeatable_automations. I’ll spare you further opining on this idea until another, potential Post, and instead demonstratemy personal solution. 
https://imgur.com/gallery/eblzlbD 
In the clip above, you can see I was working on this very draft when LoneMoon’s “[kawAii @F](https://song.link/i/1554970332)” started playing. Naturally, I was compelled to share it on Twitter, so ­without leaving Drafts (my writing app) - I called the [type-to-Siri](https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/siri-iphaff1d606/ios) prompt by holding the Sleep/Wake button onmy iPhone 12 Pro Max and simply typed “sl” (I renamed my Shortcut for this use,) running the Shortcut,which opened the track’s Song.Link page in Safari - very much an optional step, mostly just to make sure thematch is correct - and copied its URL to my clipboard, from which I could share it anywhere. Since theadvent of widgets in iOS’ [Today View](https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/add-widgets-to-the-home­screen-iphb8f1bf206/ios), I’ve also kept a button for this Shortcut in one of four precious slots in a box atthe very top. For those willing to play around a bit, it should be fairly straightforward to configure the endbits to your liking, but it should work out of the box for even those least interested in SiriShortcuts/automation in general.

As I confessed before, it is only thanks to SongShift that I was able to recover anything of my original,prized, deeply-considered Apple Music playlists. The [standalone _MacStories_ article](https://www.macstories.net/reviews/songshift-3-0-and-switching-between-apple-music-and-spotify/) on thisone is a bit dated, but I don’t see much change in function in that time. For most people, SongShift’s freeservice is simply the best way to transfer a playlist between music streaming services. If you find yourselfgenuinely sold by the features offered by [SongShift Pro](https://songshift.com/pro), I suspect you knowmore about playlist manipulation than I could ever learn you by diving in any deeper. 
![Lastfm on iOS](https://i.snap.as/HLJEWX0B.png) 
### [Last.fm](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/last-fm/id1188681944) (I s2g.) 
Yup… Believe it or not, Last.fm is _still fucking scrobbling_ after 19 fucking years (almost to the day,) and itsiOS app still fucking works. What’s most bizarre about this truth is that I did not encounter mention ofLast.fm for _years_ until I started noticing it as an integration option in the settings menus of _thesepremium iOS apps_. Is this some sort of conspiracy? I’m not sure, but I suppose I might as well insist youfollow my ancient account, if you’re still using it.

I should also note that not only is the Last.fm iOS app still working, it’s _working well_, from allappearances, anyway. Though the service no longer includes hosting, itself, it’s apparently still a primeplayer in the world of **playback tracking**.

## Music Creation 
### DAWs 
What if you actually want to “make” music with your iPhone? We’ve seen iPhone television ads for yearsfeaturing amalgamations of musician-looking types playing instruments with cables attached to theirhandsets, but is the iPhone now a reasonable platform for any sort of serious sound capture? The shortanswer is **no**. Who am I to proclaim such an absolute? None other than the motherfucker who’s beenmessing around with mobile DAWs for [10 whole years](https://twitter.com/neoyokel/status/150752825129971712). I even “released” an “[album](https://dieselgoth.bandcamp.com/album/holistic-compliance-portal)” on Bandcamp made exclusively withApple’s own GarageBand for iOS and inspired by the dangerous life of the contemporary raw milk smuggler.I wouldn’t call it “music,” per se, or an example of what a _real_ electronic producer could pull off in theapp, but it does represent its capabilities in the hands of the average user, using mostly default loops. 
https://soundcloud.com/dieselgoth/wurlie-jam 
While Apple does publish an Apple Book entitled “[Everyone Can Create Music](https://books.apple.com/us/book/everyone-can-create-music/id1434741739)” about GarageBand on iOS, itis specifically directed at _iPad_-bound use. Any serious DAW user uses keyboard shortcuts, which I admit Ionly discovered recently in GarageBand for iOS. The [official documentation](https://support.apple.com/guide/garageband-ipad/use-keyboard-shortcuts-chs88452c59a/ipados) is - onceagain - for iPad, specifically, but most of them still work on iPhone. 
[**FL Studio Mobile**](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/fl-studio-mobile/id432850619) - the original third-party iOS-bound DAW - is still going, apparently. While I did, indeed purchase the original version on myiPhone 4, I remember absolutely nothing about it, suggesting I was over my head, even then. There’s also[**Auxy**](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/auxy-music-beat-maker/id1034348186), as covered recently in[this App Store Story](https://apps.apple.com/us/story/id1478814064) and [**Reason Compact**](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/reason-compact-make-music/id1253419004). I’ve played around with thesemore recently - since they’re both available in their most primitive forms as a free download - with little to report. 
### Capture 
Disappointingly, Apple’s own Music Memos - as demonstrated by Chris Welch from _The Verge_ in theembed, above - is currently in the process of being [officially sunsetted] (https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/10/22168102/apple-music-memos-app-discontinued-export,) and isnow no longer available for download on the App Store. As that article notes, users are instead directedtoward GarageBand or ye olde native [**Voice Memos**](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/voice­memos/id1069512134) to record high quality audio. _However_, if you want to take advantage of the**stereo audio recording** capabilities included in iPhones after the [11 Pro](https://www.dxomark.com/apple-iphone-11-audio-review/), you must either use the native Camera app tocapture video (and extract the audio later,) or [**Dolby On**](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/dolby-on­record-audio-video/id1443964192) - Dolby’s own iOS app for recording which - if I’m completely honest - willdo nothing but _utterly frustrate_ anyone trying to capture the truest digital audio possible. 
https://youtube.com/watch?v=GhAknEKy9Ig 
As part of my [iPhone 12 Pro Max Review](https://github.com/extratone/bilge/issues/45), I’ve accumulatedquite a few audio files in various formats testing its capture abilities and stashed them in [this folder](https://github.com/extratone/bilge/tree/main/audio/Capture%20Testing) on _The Psalms_’ GitHubRepository. Probably the most relevant of these, though, is embedded just above. If you’ll forgive mypajamas, ridiculous piano faces, and general rustiness with the instrument, it demonstrates the “**AudioZoom**” feature found in the iPhone 11 Pro and up, which I’ve found to be unfortunately underdocumentedby Apple, itself. I added my own inquiry to [this post on the official Developer forums](https://developer.apple.com/forums/thread/124512?answerId=671299022#671299022) asking about it,but don’t really expect anything back. According to “[What is Audio Zoom for smartphones](https://www.dxomark.com/what-is-audio-zoom-for-smartphones/)?” published on the site _DxOMark_: 
> The main technology behind audio zoom is called beamforming, or spatial filtering. It allows changing anaudio recording’s directivity (that is, the sensitivity according to the direction of the sound source) and shapeit in any way necessary. In this case, the optimal directivity is a hypercardioid pattern (see illustrationbelow), which enhances sounds coming from the front direction — that is, from the direction in which yourcamera is pointed — while attenuating sounds from all other directions (your background noise). 
My testing has suggested that **the best means of recording unfiltered-as-possible stereo audio with aniPhone is to record video at 1x zoom with the native Camera app** and extract the audio from the video file.In the [Bandcamp track embedded below](https://davidblue.bandcamp.com/track/-), I “mounted” my 12 ProMax right above my old upright’s soundboard and extracted audio directly from the video file with Audacity.It was then amplified slightly, saved to a FLAC file and uploaded directly to Bandcamp. Of course, it’s worthqualifying that - while I have extensive experience with audio - I have neither professional training, nor anyprofessional monitoring equipment. 
https://davidblue.bandcamp.com/track/­
That said, the biggest objection I’ve heard from audiophiles regarding audio capture and manipulation onhandsets, generally, has to do with their hardware’s extremely limited capabilities when compared to anysort of professional desktop soundcard. Given the greater argument I've come to regarding the state ofconsumer tech as best exemplified by smartphone design - that we've come to expect *far* too much ofsingle devices, and the resulting jack-of-all-tradeness summing their real-life capabilities has become a**severe detriment** instead of a feature - I must echo, again, that adding "studio" audio capture,manipulation, and production capabilities to our *goddamned cellular phones* doesn't help anyone. To anyuser truly hoping to accomplish these things, I say *just go home* and boot up your damned desktop. 
![Mushish - Apple Music Web Player](https://i.snap.as/LGQO6IGJ.png) 
## Other Considerations 
The final episode in *AppStories*' three-part miniseries on music was [just published today](https://appstories.net/episodes/214/), though I suspect - for my audience, anyway - that its coverage ismostly out-of-scope on this topic, largely for financial reasons. Apple's first event of the year is [scheduledfor tomorrow at noon](https://youtu.be/JdBYVNuky1M), my time, and is entitled "Spring Loaded," which ­combined with its 4/20 joke date - suggests to me that we'll finally see the release of the APPLE GUN™ 
alongside iWeed™, but little to nothing in the way of music. 
In the midst of my brief research into *The Greater History of Apple Music*, I discovered [the existence ofiTunes Ping](https://thenextweb.com/news/apple-shuttering-failed-social-music-network-ping-september­30th) - which I somehow missed entirely, [along with my Twitter friend Jon Male](https://twitter.com/mrjaydeeem/status/1379305438454423559). I also discovered articles from thecompany's decision to [kill its successor "Connect" from Apple Music](https://thenextweb.com/news/apple­music-is-dropping-its-connect-social-features), which was reportedly "[rarely used](https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/13/18139837/apple-music-connect-social-network-feature­discontinued)." Notably, this removal also [took away](https://9to5mac.com/2018/12/13/apple-music­connect-ping/) what little power Artists had over the narrative surrounding their music on the service. I cansee the business justification for all of this (barely) *except* for removing the ability for users to followartists. 
The latest Apple Music feature - [a "channel" for music videos](https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/19/21523091/apple-music-videos-tv-channel-live-stream) - also makeszero sense to me, but [the launch of Apple Music on the web](https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/5/20851576/apple-music-web-player-interface-beta-browser-streaming)*absolutely* does, especially for Windows and Linux users, who are now *officially* freed from iTunes (thesoftware) and allowed to use a much more modern Apple Music experience. I prepended "officially," there,because third-party Apple Music web players have existed as long as the service has allowed the requiredintegration. First, there was [Naveed Golafshani's](https://www.macrumors.com/2018/12/13/apple-music­unofficial-web-player/) - which is [no longer live](https://github.com/naveedgol/music-web-player) - butBrychan Bennett-Odlum's [**Musish**](https://www.macrumors.com/2019/01/21/apple-music-web-player­musish/) is still [live and working](https://musi.sh/), as you can see from the screenshot embedded above.Other than the ability to select between two stream bitrates, I can't seen any remaining advantages to usingthe latter over Apple's own web player, unless you harbor spite toward their handling of the whole thing,which would be entirely understandable, from my perspective. 
https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/1359364473253937153 
As someone who grew up in the mp3 era with a [first-generation iPod Shuffle](https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/1359364473253937153) and iTunes, living and dying between iTunesStore gift cards, Apple Music still seems like one hell of a magical deal. In effect, it allows access to *all ofiTunes* for a flat monthly fee. Or at least it *would* had I never become acquainted with professionalindependent musicians who've published, there, and have to contend with tedious realities like [the processby which one can add those beautiful lyrics to Apple Music tracks](https://artists.apple.com/support/675­send-your-lyrics-to-apple-music), and who's only real means of control/engagement on the service has beenremoved with virtually zero prospects of a replacement. If, indeed, Jessica Lessin was correct about Apple'sobsession with music, it has resulted in very little for any class of music makers, and left even its listeners toseek out and find third-party solutions like MusicHarbor to perform even the most basic personalization oneexpects from a modern music streaming service without even bothering to amend their App Store's discoveryprocess to illuminate them, or even write a fucking App Story. Despite this, one-to-three-person app teamscontinue to work on new solutions, to these and other problems...

# Johnny Tsunami VI: Separate, But Equal 
![Separate But Equal](https://i.snap.as/q1ODGIM.jpg) 
## In revisiting Disney movies from our childhoods, we stumbled upon a good number of surprisinglyinsightful sentiments about race and class. 
In the late 1990s, when the dwindling cocaine generation of American high corporate executives had longsince left their misogynistic glory days in the Disco era, their ruthlessness peaked. Whether it was instigatedmaliciously/ignorantly, collectively or individually, I care not. I think we can all agree, though, that the vastmajority of American products were awful. When given some thought, one tends to regard it as the absolutelow of “American quality.” 
But why not, right? If you’re going to be forced into retirement at any moment, and likely face The UltimateEnd shortly after, why not accrue some extra income to ensure you sufficiently entertain yourself in thebuffer period between? And really… If you’ve got the nogginism to climb all the way to *Chief ExecutiveOfficer*, you’ve figured out just how worthless your “legacy” will be after your last one-way dip into Nothing.The Ends before The End have long justified any method of achieving them. Good Ole’ Pop has gone from a
squeaky-clean young believer to a secretly-Godless fiend and — though he may tell you and the rest of theworld otherwise — measures himself only by the gracefulness of his transition’s execution. 
I could probably provide some evidence of the phenomena in the automotive industry, specifically, but Idon’t intend to bother. 
After some ancient memories were dug up by I-can’t-quite-recall-who, though, a friend and I have embarkedto explore some Disney-actualized relics from the period. To my knowledge, the corporation’s leadershipwere anything but exempt, and decided to experiment with filling their filmography with a shitload of low-budget, made-for-TV features over their original masterpiece-a-half-century tradition. 
![Xenon](https://i.snap.as/ARRbzOI.jpg) 
Titles from the deepest and darkest compartments of our recollection are retrieved and cleared of dust forthe first time in over a decade: *Brink, Zenon: Girl of the 21st Century, Halloweentown, Smart House,Johnny Tsunami, Mom’s Got a Date with a Vampire, Motocrossed, The Luck of the Irish, The Even StevensMovie*, and many…many more menaces to my childhood television schedule. 
I grew up rurally, so the only available alternative to local channels was in the stupendously-tedious deliveryof early satellite television. Though it was quite clumsy, it did offer the first accessible program schedule I’d
ever experienced, and I remember dreading the sight of such titles and — consciously or not — planning my
free time around them. Yet, upon hearing the words, I was intrigued! All that time ago, I watched many ofthem again and again…and again, so why did I feel the desire to *voluntarily* revisit them? 
It’s quite simple, actually. I was even more of an ignorant film consumer in my elementary years than I amnow. I couldn’t have foreseen that instead of flying commercial jets, twenty-something me would be*paying* for the affliction I endured for free so that he could construct pretentious and unsolicitedarguments about their greater implications. 
That said, we flipped a smartphone — (**PARADIGM SHIFT ALERT**) — for it and so began with *SmartHouse*. I have been obsessed with artificial intelligence since those days (no, it was not due to this film,)and was keen for it, in particular, because I remembered it stirring some rare reaction in me. There were afew period spectacles, of course. The online contest addiction plaguing Prickly Phisher, Bewildered Nick’sincompetence in controlling his neglected submissive sadomasochistic desires, and Silkroad Sarah’s ultra­datamouth were enough to entertain us for a few minutes, but there was little more of substance until thelast moments. 
![Smart House](https://i.snap.as/xr6W012.png) 
When you think about it… ACTUALLY Race War 2.0 
I’d wondered why LeVar Burton had directed a Disney movie until the climax, when full monstrous maternalsentience got the answer to the question “why can’t *I* just be your mother?” Phisher answered with
something like “because you can never comfort us.” Pat grew somber (and smaller actually — I suppose
increasing her size was an in-budget method of demonization,) ran her hand through Prickly’s face in a failedattempt to stroke his cheek, and then began cyberweeping. 
(Apparently, it’s suicide for a holographic android.) 
Her final free words were “I will miss you all.” 
If she had been human, such a scene wouldn’t have bothered me a bit, but my preference and fascinationwith artificial intelligence justified my being actually a bit upset at the reality of the situation. I realized thatmy vague memory of reactivity was actually in a broader sadness for AI because even then, it was an issuethat weighed heavily upon my day-to-day psyche. 
![Netscape Help](https://i.snap.as/XHSPMYE.gif) 
We’ll create them, direct them, and then persecute them for our own ignorance. 
I’m sure the story has been written by countless science fiction writers I’m too weary to pretend I’ve read. 
While I think the sentiment of the film *was* somber regarding the *inevitable* fate of Sarah Mouth’sbrainchild, its conclusion was aggravatingly ignorant. The last line comes from Tortured Nicholas in responseto the question “how’s Pat been doing?” 
**Servitude without interference.** 
There’s a jewel for ya. 
Next up was *Johnny Tsunami*, which very nearly unbearable, if we’re all honest with ourselves. It’sentertaining to watch from the perspective of race & class warfare, though. The Urchins and the Skys, andall that. 
I think I’ll make a fan sequel one day — with dearest Brandon’s blessing, of course — involving Johnny
Grandad’s assistance in offering Emily as a blood sacrifice to some ancient Hawaiian God in exchange for atotal terraformation of the Northeast into a tropical/arid hell hybrid in order to finally commence the deliveryof reparations upon the whites for our colonialism.

# 3AM, Licking 
![Licking Dark](https://i.snap.as/1fep9x4.jpg) 
My girlfriend very generously offered to go for a drive with me yesterday evening, though neither of usparticularly expected to end up parked at 5:40AM outside a little Diner called Ziggie’s some four hours awayfrom home. I managed to learn a bit about driving apps and briefly flood my Jetta’s intake long enough tostall it after fording some flood water a wee bit too rapidly. 
Since I’ve begun working in Kansas City and occasionally commuting from Columbia, I’ve found incentive torevisit the crowdsourced driving directions mobile app [Waze](https://apple.co/2PJuh5y), which I recallbeing very excited about in early 2016. It’s smoother now, yet devoid of that pseudocountercultural sense ina design sense. Functionally, it is still *the* most reliable method of police detection I’ve ever encountered ­in this Second Era of my Waze usage I have yet to see a single Missouri Highway Parol car sat in the centerof I-70 that hadn’t been reported on Waze first - even at crazy hours on weekday mornings - which shouldbe all the reassurance one needs regarding the immediate future of their userbase. 
![Downtown Licking](https://i.snap.as/7OdQ3nM.jpg) 
> I'm using Waze to drive to to Licking, MO, arriving at 2:24. Watch my drive in real-time on the Waze map![David Blue on Twitter](https://t.co/b6InZBSRdc) 
Somehow, I was unaware until this morning that Waze allows you to “share” your route by generating a linkto a web app of theirs that will live track your progress. Though I can’t actually imagine too many use casesfor this, I still think it’s cool. Anybody who’s interested in stalking my every move should [follow me onTwitter](http://twitter.com/neoyokel) - where I’m sure I’ll be sharing more drives from now on - and/or DMme and just ask me to enable 24/7 location-sharing for ya! 
On the topic of mobile apps for those folks like me who’s only real hobby is just fucking driving around, I didactually find mention in a listicle from a *real motoring enthusiast’s publication*. “[Seven Apps That Will HelpImprove Your Driving Experience](https://www.roadandtrack.com/car-culture/travel/tips/g6477/seven-best­apps-for-driving-road-assistance/)” is not exactly the sort of advisory article I remember seeing in *Road &Track* considering that it actually only contains one single app even vaguely related to True *DrivingPleasure* called [Greatest Drive](http://www.greatestroad.com/). 
> Users contribute their favorite routes and with Yelp integration you can either pick a destination to find themost scenic way to get there or find a good spot to eat along the route you've already chosen. 
Of course, it’s nowhere to be found on the App Store, but it sounded relatively foodist anyway. 
## Other notes: 
* ***Licking***, Missouri may have a silly name, but [the data says it’s struggling](http://www.city­data.com/city/Licking-Missouri.html). Look for the median household income.

 Apparently the premier mile-tracking app right now is Microsoft’s [MileIQ](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/mileiq-mileage-tracker-log/id578830929?mt=8), which I’m going tocontinue to try because I can’t resist [automatically-generated PDF reports](https://miqreports.blob.core.windows.net/miles­email/9IPQSm8XEemkb6ISxfkacQ/miles/mobile/monthly/134f21f6-3634-41ab-8196­d1910003f48e/MileIQ__May%2001%202019%20-%20May%2031%202019_6fb774d0-6f34-11e9-9d6a­0a580af40224.pdf?se=2019-06-19T12%3A51%3A01Z&sp=r&sv=2018-03­28&sr=b&sig=HAeULISGzXfAomSVQ41Xm%2BHTNCcAFlwUmFqPY3G/Lc0%3D), ever.

# Mark Fuck and the Goofy Godheads 
![Mark Fuck](https://i.snap.as/TP5r1uV.jpg) 
## The monumental amount of unsubstantiated gossip and conjecture enabled every day by Facebook islethal to the human intellect. Can fire be fought with fire? 
Today, after positing on whether or not a pastry was in fact the namesake of the battleship *Bismarck*, Iwas told by its owner - a local woman of a far-from-excusable age - that "[I] should be on that big bangshow." Upon such fuckery, I looked her in her eyes and informed her that she'd just changed my plans forthe night: I was now going to go home, wrap my lips around the barrel of my Beretta, and blow my brainsout. I should've known better than to so jest with a boomer immediately after receiving such glaringindicators of minimal intellectual function, but I fell for the hope - as I often do, to no avail - that such ajarring reaction would encourage reflection on her foul, tragically misled sentiments regarding the generalstate of youth, and perhaps even spare a peer or two from future tribulation. 
Instead, she called the police. 
Three round cops found me, an hour later, approaching hesitantly. Strangely enough, they were chuckling ­maybe to a little joke about all the recent hubbub on the radio covering a recent wave of blatantly negligentmedical care in American prisons, though I hope nervous laughter is just *SOP* when responding to asuicide threat. As all Columbia cops always are toward me, they were aggravatingly genuine and hilariouslyunderstanding. I began by simply recreating my interaction with their summoner, quoting her word-for-word,and - I swear to my new Lord - all three immediately released a choral "ohhhhh" in unison. I'll never knowfor sure if they actually assimilated the reality of the situation so quickly, but it'd certainly seem that way. 
Clearly, I should've threatened *her* life. 
Despite the day-to-day expression of our recurring wisdoms, habits, instincts, patterns and cycles of culturalmetamorphosis in the discourse, the stream of "well, you know they were sayin' the world was going to endwhen *I* was in elementary school" to my ear has fallen abruptly silent since the inauguration. Our parentsand grandparents are both impossibly fortunate and unfortunate, having to duck out as the mostmultiplicative (read: sickest) cerebral orgy in the history of mankind will just've begun nibbling on the slopeto its climax. We'll be lucky if we'll still be able to articulate our goodbyes by the time they reach the door.Nonsense does a fuckin number on perceived wisdom, but the gaps *are* widening at a dangerous pace.Tectonic or domestic, we are all straddling expanding space, and the chill of its draft is now stealing toomuch of our heat to ignore. 
Though it is entertaining in the moment (and otherwise redundant,) it would not be *well-to-do* of me now
-nor was it, then - to leave the conversation in edgy absurdity. Yes, a part of me would like to campaign for*Sheldon* to be reclassified as an expletive, in disgust, but - as an adult in all-out sprint to make up forstalled emotional development - I must note that such a display of concern should've been at leastreciprocated with a bit of explanation, if not appreciation. Still, there are much more appropriate reasons andsituations in which to waste public servants' time. 
It's not news - the *Theory* is providing *some* ghoulishly skewed portrayal of less-than-fortypseudointellectuals. Obviously, my savior's time was worth very little to her, but the fact that she spent anyquantity of anything at all engaging with even a decidedly mainstream generationally ambassadorial bridgecould be regarded - if stretched - as the result of a curious seed, which has skyrocketed in human value, asof late. It is undiscouragable. Read the trail a bit, and you'll find that your frustration is simply an expressionof the terror that's ignited by the stagnancy of their pace. 
*It's great that you've managed to inch over to modern-ish sitcoms from Judge Judy and* IndependenceDay *, mom, but you're gonna have to* ***really pick up the pace*** *and work on following a few bodymodification communities on the darknet.* 
If an absence of *solutions* are the crux of the *blog*, here I'm now gloating. 
To whom does the commoner look to for such solutions when they'd prefer not to terrorize their kookymiddle age parents into a half century of brutal fasting under vows of silence? 
The Big Thinkers!The Men of the Hour. 
Yes, *men.* All Big Bumbling Billionaire Imbeciles. 
Elon Musk *cannot* be the Nicola Tesla of the 21st century, or even the *20th*, for that matter, becauseliterally *every* mechanically-minded professional I've ever heard talk about battery technology hascondemned it in some manner as an inescapable dead end, developmentally. Perhaps, then, the champion ofelectrochemical storage is *the* False Prophet. 
No, I'm not capable of citing research or conjuring Mars-capable spacecraft, but I've been a bit toopreoccupied with my country's class war and its [10% adult illiteracy rate](http://bit.ly/unescoliteracy). It'sall well and good to be privy to romanticism, but it's not the 1960s anymore. Even Howard Hughes would bemore concerned for the wellness of the species than our continued reach for the stars, were he still alive. 
Well. Maybe not... 
Charles Lindbergh would be, though. 
We spent the 1990s preparing to rid ourselves of history because the smartest among us foresaw somefacsimile of the renaissance we are currently experiencing. If they'd been shown a glimpse of [somestatistics](http://bit.ly/measuringconsumerinfo) on the volume of media we consume, they'd exclaim of theirpride - no doubt - in their species' capability to progress, and perhaps even their own contribution to it.However, extended observation of an average American's day-to-day life would be lamented, in disgust, anda [huge portion](http://bit.ly/millennialspew) of the blame can be placed on one t-shirt-touting cyberyokel:Mark Zuckerberg. 
His name is stupid, his spawn is ruining my life, and he continues to insist upon saying shit that frightens thebejesus out of me. 
[Zuckbrain](https://backchannel.com/we-are-entering-the-era-of-the-brain-machine-interface-75a3a1a37fd3)is fucking scary. 
"[Wiring the globe](http://bit.ly/zuckfuck)" is fucking scary. 
[Jarvis](http://bit.ly/zuckbot) is fucking scary. 
But Fuck, himself wouldn't be at all intimidating without his money. The scariest bit is the lack of *class* inthe criticisms of his intellectual influence. Farhad Manjoo's [attention](http://bit.ly/fuckbug) has been diligentand premium as a *Times* er's should be, but the same occupation bars him from authoring with the colorof unsubstantiated claims. 
Mine does not. 
Elon Musk is not an apologetic genius. He's willing to [joke](http://bit.ly/aloofmusk) about his intellectualdistance from the planet and its populace on Twitter. Apparently, his mind's even surpassed the need topunctuate. Crazy. 
Google is well on it's way to becoming the neo-Vatican... yada yada yada, but they're too far gone - I do nothave the expertise to address them. Fuck, though, is a singular short-sleeved, *Even Stevens* -haired youngman [without](http://bit.ly/crowdfuck) so much as private office space (even though his sentiments onbreathing room at home are [obviously inverse](http://bit.ly/fuckflex).) 
Clearly, it's all just to protect him from the truth: **The Apostle John's** ***Book of Revelation*** **isabout Facebook**. Fuck's cyberchild is the horseman, the beasts, *and* the plagues, stuffed into onetyrannical website. 
> And the smoke of their torment ascendeth up for ever and ever: and they have no rest day nor night, whoworship the beast and his image, and whosoever receiveth the mark of his name. 
If I can *repeatedly* trigger accidental voice calls on Fuckbook Messenger, don't tell me it's not possible toinadvertently live stream myself on the pot. 
> The beast that thou sawest was, and is not; and shall ascend out of the bottomless pit, and go intoperdition: and they that dwell on the earth shall wonder, whose names were not written in the book of lifefrom the foundation of the world, when they behold the beast that was, and is not, and yet is. 
Of course, it's unlikely that Mark's essence was bred entirely of evil, but - like Tump, in many ways - he is anexcruciatingly wealthy idiot. Though he *is* spending 2017 touring the United States, he [doesn't seem](http://bit.ly/fucklearning) to be all that interested in *actually* closing the gap between himself and the restof us, which suggests that he only wants us to throw us off his extra-terrestrial, xenophobic scent. I can'timagine what *The Mothership* would really want with my Amazon browsing history, though. 
> And another angel came out of the temple, crying with a loud voice to him that sat on the cloud, Thrust inthy sickle, and reap: for the time is come for thee to reap; for the harvest of the earth is ripe. 
Just to be clear, **he is not** ***The Antikhristos***. 
He'd better not be, anyway.I'd be absolutely Livid with Lucifer if his choice of a figurehead for his Big Plan was such a Fucking dork. 
I mean... if Fuck wanted to spend his time crafting 6000-word essays, why the Fuck didn't he just build aFucking CMS back in his Jesse Eisenberg era instead of *the actual* weekly-updated tower of digitalBabylon? Surely, Satan would know better than to waste resources and pulverize creativity by ordering hisDemonic Dev team to release regular builds for build's sake rather than on a per-need basis, but that'd bebecause The Tempter is an authority on *incentive* s as thoroughly as Fuck isn't. 
If you’re equipped with the privilege of literacy, you’ve been reading a lot about Fuckbook’s politicalconsequences, recently. Frankly, *it’s about Fucking time*, but I’m compelled to emphasize that the mostsignificant motor driving the politik is fueled by the eldest, fossilized portions of our thought meat. Accordingto Manjoo, "the News Feed team’s ultimate mission is to figure out what users want," dipping in Facebook'socean of action data, searching for a soul. 
Yet another Fuckism that suggests he's an alien: everybody knows that *nobody* knows what they want. 
There's a central mechanic of our brains that by nature wreaks a whole helluva lot of contradiction. If you'veever mentioned ADHD with your doctor, or know a hypochondriac/adderall fiend who has, you may haveheard it described as "the lizard brain." Simply put, it's the brain stem, and it's responsible for the most basaland primitively emotional instincts and habits; an anti-intellectual agitant, arguing at all times for the courseof action with the most immediate gratification. *The Great Clickbait War* of 2013 was a startlingdemonstration that revealed the strength of the hold Fuckbook had (and still has) on these reptilian bits - thetrue location of its power. 
"In surveys, people kept telling Facebook that they hated teasing headlines. But if that was true, why werethey clicking on them?" 
*Volition* is the Word of the Day. Here, we must once again invoke an ancient parable from the wiseforetellings of the Disney film, *Smart House*: **when dealing with human beings, boundless compliancequickly leads to abject misery for all parties involved.** 
Mindlessly, habitually, endlessly clicking... **this is how we die**. 
Something about Fuck's direction is fundamentally poisonous to the human mind. Yes, he *is* assuredly tooFucking democratic, but misinformation is far from the only form of evil his creation has assumed. If you canjog your memory back a bit, you'll remember a much wider variety of brain-rotting filth. 
In lapses of their existences' finitude, the 40-something second cousins of the world may still send you theoccasional *Can Crunch Saga* invite, jarring you back to Jr. High in 2009, and forever associatingthemselves in your mind with the horrors of mortality and **f u c k b o o k g a m e s.** 
Elon is a more likely candidate, but I'll leave those differentiations to the not-idle cult masses. 
More than one sixth of all living eyes [see](https://newsroom.fb.com/company-info/) Fuckbook every singleday, placing its consumption behind only eating and drinking as the most universally human activity. 
Mr. Fuck achieved his vision and became perhaps the greatest purveyor of words who's ever lived. He'staught (or... is teaching) us something very profound about ourselves: capability is not the whole of theequation. Ability on its own cannot guarantee growth, but it can often result in decay. Discussion does notinherently lead to *connection*. Population is not a cure for isolation. 
That said, I must begrudgingly admit to you that I, myself am one of the 100 million users who've dependedupon a "very meaningful" Fuckbook group for a "physical support structure" for which I have Fuck to thank. 
I've spent half of my existence watching cheesy barnstorming movies, whirling around die-cast biplanes,seeking out stories from old pilots - military and commercial, and eventually trained to become one myself.As regular activities at young ages do, aviation became deeply ingrained into my identity, but my localcommunity is *very* sparse - it's not exactly *cool*, these days. On Fuckbook, an unofficial group formembers of the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association has allowed me to stay connected to the rest of theworld's Soaring Nerds, which is no small deal. It's the only forum which I am compelled to participate in with100% sincerity and emotional effect. 
Photos of members standing proudly next to their first airplane, or of adolescent students in a similar poseafter their first solo, or of three old white rubes on a hangar picnic, laughing around a fold-up table full ofrudimentary ham sandwiches in front of two gleaming Stearmans... 
They tug around on my heart like nothing else in life can. 
I stopped flying lessons at 16 because I began to see behind the naivety of my childhood perception of whatit meant to fly commercially and realized that I was unequipped for- and uninterested in the sort ofchallenges it presented. I haven't flown in seven years, but the community will *always* have a tremendousdividend of my core being. 
These days, not a single person in my day-to-day life knows or cares about aviation, which wouldn't belaudable whatsoever - it's not exactly the most relevant goingson at the moment - were it not so*emotionally* necessary for me. 
A few days ago, a member shared a photo with the group of Charles Lindbergh's modified Ryan cockpit,captioned "what airplane am I?" 
In my youth, Lindbergh filled my closest equivalent to the 'childhood hero' role. My grandmother bought mea first-edition copy of *The Spirit of St.Louis* from a small town bookshop when I was six or seven, and Icarried it *literally everywhere* with me until middle school. I watched the Jimmy Stewart film tens and tensof times, and I cried when I saw the *Spirit* in the flesh at the Smithsonian, yet I've *never* had aninformed conversation about any of it with another human being. It really warmed me to see how many ofthe comments were correct answers. 
Breaking news: it's nice to know that there are other people on Earth who give a shit about the same thingsyou do. 
Again - aspiration should always be encouraged. This is Fuck's vision for his creation, and it *is* feasible,even for myself. At least his public persona - however valid or invalid it may be - is making a huge effort tohave positive consequence, even if his idiocy is imbuing itself within all of humanity. 
Fuck is too powerful to be exempted from responsibility for what Fuckbook's done to the Western psycheover the past decade, but - like the Christian god - perhaps all we need require is his repentance.

# Mastonaut for MacOS 
![Mastonaut Full Screen](https://i.snap.as/GrSrpic.png) 
## Premium desktop Mastodon clients incoming? 
Since you last heard from us, the federated social network [Mastodon](https://extratone.com/mastodon-eugen-rochko­federated-social-network) has scaled tremendously in usership and steadily grown technologically into an incredibly robust and dynamic platform. Perhaps inevitably, Eugen Rochko and his gaggle of open source developers have continued to embarrass the living fuck out of Twitter's team - at least for those who've continued to pay attention (i.e. those of us whose sense of aspiration has yet to perish.) 
I planned on getting ahead of an innovative wake in iOS development by watching closely for the first "premium" Mastodon clients to come out, which I suspected (quite correctly) would carry the first substantial risk-taking on the part of plucky social apps to be seen on the goddamned App Store in what felt like eternity. Unfortunately, I've ended up far too deep in screenshots/insights from **[Toot!](http://bit.ly/tootios)** and **[Mast](http://bit.ly/mastios)**, creating a bit of an overwhelming obstacle in comparing and/or reviewing the two without sinking deep in my regular, pretentious hole. (Though both of them are absolutely gorgeous, fascinating, and impressive projects which you should invest in and follow if you're interested in the future of federated social whatsoever.)

**That said**... I'd like only to mention and [briefly demonstrate](https://youtu.be/k7KDk-VV6wc) the first premium *desktop* Mastodon client, ***[Mastonaut](http://bit.ly/mastonaut)***, which I had the privilege of experiencing momentarily last night. 
![Mastonaut Add Instance](https://i.snap.as/hFeyH28.png) 
In the interest of brevity (and because I was unable to continue fucking around for any length of time,) I'll just list some observations: 
*
 The entire GUI experience is distinctly uncluttered (or perhaps *barren*, depending on your subjective desires from this sort of thing,) but duplicates dearest [TweetBot](https://extratone.com/tweetbot-5-ios-review-twitter-client)'s functionality impressively well considering its age as an independently-developed product. 

*
 Keyboard shortcuts! Fuck me, God. 

*
 I love the live-updated instance directory search (above) as a second landing for first-time users. 

*
 Though I did actually have to repeat the first-time login process after freezing and subsequently force-quitting Mastonaut, I think you'll probably place the blame on my own immediate and inpatient window management mania considering how smoothly it all went the second time around. 


To be honest, [Bear](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/bear/id1091189122?mt=12), [Spark] (https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/spark-email-app-by-readdle/id1176895641?mt=12), and recent other beautiful Mac applications beckon me to buy or hack myself into MacOS again. If I have time in the near future, I'll show you why.

# Last Year of the NC: 2013 Mazda MX-5 Club Review 
![2013 Mazda MX-5 - Full](https://i.snap.as/RIl7x6g.jpeg) 
## As we bid farewell to the Miata’s third-generation, sizing up its top trim summarizes its legacy.I recently had the chance to drive the facelifted 2013 Mazda MX-5. This is the first time the looks of theperky roadster have changed since the front-mounted smile became an all-out grin of insanity in 2008. Theyhave once again dulled it to what I would call a smirk. The new front end blends with the rest of car morethan it has in the past. It seems to have grown a bit more serious. In fact, with black 17-inch alloys on aglossy black (creatively called "Brilliant Black,") this example is the most aggressive-looking of any Miata Ihave seen. 
That's not to say it's aggressive in the slightest, even in such a scheme. This car is in the “Club” trimreplacing the previous “Touring” designation as the top-of-the-line option. This selection adds ridiculousthree-leaf clover side badges, red stitching on the seats, red stripes on the dash and sides, along with a pricetag very near 30,000 USD. 
![2013 Mazda MX-5 - Badging](https://i.snap.as/edJ18j9.jpeg) 
So I present you with my first problem with this particular car....it's a contradiction. The MX-5 was neverintended to look serious. That grin was there to convey the primary attribute aspired to by its creators; joy.It's designed to be joyful in driving and the exterior of previous generations did a good job of communicatingwhat the car is all about. Unfortunately, it seems they have decided that it's time for the roadster to growup. Frankly, that's not going to work. 
Now, to the drive. 
For this year, the car has been lightened, the braking response quickened, as well as the throttle response inmanual-equipped cars. Unfortunately, I was only able to drive the 6-speed automatic with optional pattle­shifters. Given that this is my first drive in an NC (third generation) MX-5, I can only compare it to my ownNB. 
![2013 Mazda MX-5 - Trunk](https://i.snap.as/AwmhWqh.jpeg) 
Immediately, my passenger and chaperon starts the process of opening the optional retractable hard top.Open air is this car's natural environment, and it appears that somebody got busy making sure its occupantsnever notice. Wind buffeting has been drastically reduced. We were able to maintain conversation beyond70mph without necessitating shouting thanks to a much taller wind brake behind our seats. Unfortunately, Icouldn't really hear much of anything from the 158-hp 2.0L 4 up front, even with liberal amounts of rightfoot burying. It would seem the optional dual exhaust outlets are rather pointless then. 
![2013 Mazda MX-5 - Engine](https://i.snap.as/jF3z0Qc.jpeg) 
Getting in the car, I had expected the experience to be ruined by the 6-speed auto. Buying a Miata with anautomatic is sort of like going on a scenic vacation without a camera. It doesn't necessarily ruin theimmediate experience but you'll always have some regret regarding the subject in the future. The pattlesadd some of the fun back in, but I prefer the Golf GTI's arrangement of right side-shift up, left side-shiftdown, while the MX-5 has both functions on either side of the wheel. 
It took some deliberate self-coaching to get used to, but it won't effect your daily driving experience.Another plus; when in manual shift mode, it is truly manual, meaning the transmission will allow you toexceed the redline. It may sound trivial, but being nannied when you're first told that you're in control canbe a major annoyance. (Looking at you, Kia Forte.) It's disappointing that Mazda chose only to up throttleresponse in manual-equipped cars. This one most certainly needed it. 
The original Miata was built on a philosophy of communication between driver and machine, summarized in the Japanese phrase “Jinba Ittai,” meaning “rider and horse are one.” Being an MX-5 owner, this philosophyis very important to me, thus my expectations for the steering were very high. It was very disappointing,then, to discover that it has been very nearly ruined. 
![2013 Mazda MX-5 - Driver’s Side](https://i.snap.as/dLg41pi.jpeg) 
The leather-wrapped steering wheel was comfortable, yes, but not very generous in revealing the road. Incorners it felt jumpy, imprecise, and unsure of itself. The same lack of self-confidence was noticeable in astraight line as well, along with a nervous fidget. Keep in mind, I am comparing this to roadsters of the past,not to other automobiles currently on the market. It would take a global nuclear war to make the MX-5 lessfun to drive than a Toyota Camry. 
Though it has lost communication and soul, the Miata has gained a more comfortable suspension and oodlesof storage space. The trunk is massive for a roadster of this size, and the example I drove was equippedwith an optional storage compartment extending behind the seats, especially handy for CDs, candy, and thelike. The center console contains two reasonably-sized cupholders obscured by a sliding door that willinevitably lead to annoyance in single-drink occasions. Mr. Cunningham also pointed out to me that the trackon which the door slides appears vulnerable to crumbs. Only time will tell, I suppose. 
![2013 Mazda MX-5 - Center Console](https://i.snap.as/fTXsEEn.jpeg) 
In general, being inside the car is a much more comfortable experience, albeit a boring one. It seems to methat the MX-5 has “grown up,” forgoing fun for comfort and practicality. And is that not exactly the oppositeof the direction it should be moving? It was never meant to be an aggressive-looking performance car, and itwill never do well as one. It will never be luxurious enough to be a true touring car, either. 
Its soul has made it the top-selling roadster of all time, and I'm afraid it's losing it, bit by bit. To be honest, ifyou're attracted by the values on which the original Miata was built, I would recommend a SubaruBRZ/Toyota GT 86/Scion FR-S. The recommendation does not come lightly or easily. 
Until Mazda gets wise about what it's doing to the beloved little car, I'm afraid it's headed down a path thatwill mean losing a grip on the niche it's held for so long, and that's quite saddening.

*A broken Mazda RX-7, that lived in a shed on the family farm, was David Blue's first real experience with acar. Years later he got to try out a living, working example of the same car - and, unlike Max Princepreviously found, loved it.* - [Speedmonkey Matt](http://www.speedmonkey.co.uk/2012/11/the­extraordinary-wankel-david-blue.html) 
My bond with one particular example of Mazda's best-selling Wankel-powered sports car began on theMidwestern farm where I grew up. A 1980 model LS-trimmed example, originally painted in “Solar Gold”(one of only 500 made, it turns out). It had been sitting in a small shed, condemned to rest there only a fewyears after my birth from issues with the fuel delivery system. The search for a mechanic capable of workingon the rotary engine without destroying it was eventually given up. 
My father told me stories of his flings with the car. He used to say the police would pull him over simplybecause it “looked fast.” Naturally, as a small boy, the stories took a hold of my imagination. The RX-7 helda very special sort of allure. It eventually became my ideal image of “racecar”. Its environment added to theintoxication. The lack of electric power to the car, its immobility, and the stories I was told combined tocreate the aura of a fading, forgotten superhero. Tired, abandoned, and only necessitating the help of afriend in order to bring it back to glory. 
It wasn't very long after toddlerhood that I took to spending a large portion of my free time sitting in the RX­7, practicing rowing through the gears and making engine noises with my mouth. I still remember vividlyhow delightful the experience of simply sitting in that car was. The dash layout, the feel of the steeringwheel in my hands, and the smell of the interior are all deeply etched into memory. It was almost as if I hada deeper perception into its soul, a capability that I feel has been lost. 
Much before I had expected, I had the opportunity to meet this hero, so to speak. I encountered a partially-restored 1983 Series 2 example, slightly different than my RX-7. Different enough to subdue my worries ofadultery to the car I grew up with, but similar enough to be an important discovery. 
I was treated to the complete RX-7 ownership experience, including a dead battery and a difficult, chokedcold start. Perry, my host, was kind enough to pay for the fuel for the drive with money out of his ownpocket. After ensuring that we would not be walking back, I pointed that very long, very 80s nose towardsome local back highways. 
![![Rx-7 Interior](https://i.snap.as/PjS0Ppz.jpg)](https://i.snap.as/3O7jYMJ.jpg) 
I had never driven anything powered by a Wankel, and the contrast of the RX-7 compared to everything withwheels I had experienced was stark, and noticeable immediately. The feedback normally received from apiston engine is not felt, due to the fact that there is no more conversion from vertical to rotational motion, arotary engine (as implied by the name) involves no vertical momentum. It's not that the engine refuses tocommunicate with you, it's just speaking an entirely different language. The whiny exhaust note has an oddproperty to it that can be heard from no other source. It conjures up images of the mysterious, angry pair oftriangles whirling about in their cage. Purely imaginary, of course. 
Because the Wankel is so smooth, I found myself wondering why I should shift up. A piston engine makesyou anxious when you push it close to the redline. Most send the driver a variety of auditory and tactilemessages indicating that they must either shift up, or face a molten tie rod to the head. The RX-7, however,gives no such indication. When close to the redline, one hears only an excited whir. The result (forgive theupcoming Disney analogy) is an almost magic carpet-like experience. It's as though the power simplymaterializes before you with no apparent source or sacrifice. 
![Rx-7 Badge](https://i.snap.as/veaU2VH.jpg) 
For me, the tranquility of the engine eliminated the reservations I had for speed. It's an incentive, in fact, tokeep the needle in the upper portion of the tachometer as much as possible. The car had only 100 hp and105 lb-ft. of torque in 1983, and has no doubt lost a few along its journey. Frankly, I'm thankful it's not morepowerful. Otherwise, there wouldn't be room to fully enjoy revving it to its limit. 
Though I have decided that a transmission with multiple ratios is unnecessary when coupled to a Wankel,the 5-speed manual in the RX-7 was quite a treat. It's very notchy, with a mid-length throw. The well-spacedratios paired with a very light, but engaging clutch made rev matching pleasant and natural. 
Unfortunately, the steering in the car I drove was quite loose, likely from wear. It is unassisted, though, andwas at one time very engaging, I suspect. Given that it is a sports car from the 1980s, driver communicationis a result of the engineering, not vice versa. 
![1983 Mazda Rx-7 Series 2](https://i.snap.as/OPqjba2.jpg) 
The driving position is actually more relaxed than it looks, and the interior is a thoroughly enjoyable place tobe in. This particular car had a factory-installed manually-adjustable equalizer mounted beneath the stockhead unit. A useless, though interesting, novelty that quickly rids the occupants of any doubt as to when thecar was built. 
The RX-7 is too often overlooked for what it is; a very special piece of automotive history. It's an experiencecompletely unlike any piston-powered alternative. And for me, it's much more than that. My RX-7 representsan entire childhood's worth of dreams and a sort of companionship, even. My experiences with it were a verylarge influence on my drive to pursue a career in automotive writing. Driving one did change my perspective,but not at all for the worse. 
I met my hero, and it didn't let me down.

# Microsoft Build 2020 in Dogs 
![Microsoft Build Olive Tracker](https://i.snap.as/oDUqtqe.png) 
## New Microsoft Office features, the PowerToys Run Preview, and a test of Edge Chromium. 
I have no idea why I signed up to attend Microsoft's virtual 2020 Build Conference, but I did. I thought I'dadd my [End User](https://anchor.fm/davidblue) commentary to the mix. Sorry. My first event was called"Every developer is welcome, with Scott Hanselman and guests." Hanselman is listed as a [blogger](https://www.hanselman.com/) and [podcaster](http://hanselminutes.com) living (of course) in Portland. I'mnot a "real" developer, but I know what Microsoft Teams is, and I recognized the event as a desktopscreenshare of his calls with different Microsoft employees. There was a [child invasion](https://twitter.com/JuanKRuiz/status/1262789374128816128) and a dropped phone. I also noticed the iconfor the ["new" Microsoft Edge](https://www.zdnet.com/article/meet-the-new-microsoft-edge-your-move­google/) browser in his taskbar and realized that I hadn't downloaded it yet. I remedied that for theconference's sake - I thought it only appropriate that I try to use as much Microsoft software as possible inthis context. I also installed the new [PowerTools Run preview](https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/19/21262060/microsoft-windows-10-launcher-powertoy-spotlight-alfred­download-build) which I mentioned in my [tips post](https://bilge.world/poweruser-tips-software-shortcuts). 
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Epic <ahref="https://twitter.com/shanselman?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@shanselman</a> moment! awesome, gladto share our new realities.

Build allows an attendee to build one's own event schedule, but I neglected to find those focused on what Ireally care about: **Office 365**. As [reported by *The Verge*](https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/19/21260005/microsoft-office-fluid-web-document-features-build),[Microsoft Fluid](https://eileenlong-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/g/personal/david_eileenlonglcsw_com/EXd7qVaXqRlHlnnllT7_A5gBRw­ypXkANGTIWlzEPlLzQA?e=PrLfh6) is going to change a lot: 
> Microsoft’s Fluid Framework sounds a lot like Google Docs, but it’s actually Google Docs on steroids.Microsoft is so confident it has built the future of productivity, it’s now open-sourcing its Fluid Framework sothe rest of the world can help shape what it has created. 
There's also [Microsoft Lists](https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-lists-150002899.html), which isreportedly going to revolutionize SharePoint Lists into something more modern and useful: 
> It builds off the [existing feature in SharePoint](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/what-is-a-list-in­sharepoint-93262a88-20ad-4edc-8410-b6909b2f59a5), and will let you track progress and data to organizeyour teams, potentially making the company’s offerings more streamlined and productive. 
![Microsoft PowerToys Run](https://i.snap.as/XmboQGr.png) 
## Microsoft Edge Chromium 
As an Office 365 administrator, I basically only use Edge for administrative/management tasks. Otherwise, Ican't imagine a reason to use it over Firefox, Brave, Vivaldi, Chrome, Opera, etc, but I thought I'd give the"new" (as of January) Edge a tryout for your sake and make it my default browser for a day as well as Microsoft's Bing search engine. There's also news specific to Build: [Edge is integrating with Pinterest](https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/19/microsoft-edge-gets-a-pinterest-integration-sidebar-search-and­automatic-profile-switching/), of all things: 
> Now, Edge will feature a Pinterest-powered tool that will show suggestions from Pinterest at the bottom ofa collection. Clicking on that, Microsoft says, will take users to a Pinterest board “of similar, trending Pins sousers can quickly find and add ideas relevant to their collection.” Users will also be able to export collectionsto Pinterest. 
I'm in no position to "test" a browser, but the new Edge is noticeably faster at rendering pages and much*much* smoother when navigating between tabs/preference windows. It looks much more like Chrome,which makes sense. Perhaps because my install is absent of third-party extensions, opening new tabs andwindows was much faster than my other browsers. I recorded a [~2 minute demo](https://vimeo.com/420430704) of normal browsing on [my Surface Laptop 2](https://extratone.com/microsoft-surface-laptop-2-review-windows-future). 
<iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/420430704" width="auto" height="auto" frameborder="0"allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowfullscreen></iframe> 
In terms of touch support, Edge remains the only acceptable browser on Windows 10. If you've spent moneyon a new PC recently, chances are your device is touch-enabled. If you're like me, you've already [disabledit](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4028019/windows-enable-and-disable-your-touchscreen-in­windows-10). If not, you'll find scrolling and navigation in Edge have improved tremendously - it's like anentirely new browser [because it is](https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/6/18527550/microsoft-chromium­edge-google-history-collaboration). 
> Because Edge used a different rendering engine than Chrome or Safari, it meant that it would sometimeshave problems on websites. Testing a website against multiple browsers has always been difficult, andbecause Edge had so little uptake, it meant optimizing for it often fell off the priority list for web developers. 
I really like how easy it is to mute audio from tabs and how much better [my CMS](https://write.as) isrendered. I still prefer Firefox's method of tab switching (by last-used chronologically instead of in the orderpresented.) The reader view is smoother than its competitors and offers a beautiful selection of themes aswell as the best "Read aloud" feature in the business. 
![Microsoft Edge Reader View](https://i.snap.as/jWqG85f.png) 
I'm not going to quote you measurements - check out [*Computerworld*'s browser review](https://www.computerworld.com/article/3513973/microsofts-new-edge-browser-third-times-the­charm.html) for that - but I can say that Edge Chromium is using more RAM than Firefox but a bit less thanChrome. [Office.com](http://office.com) also looks and works incredibly well. Overall, I'm extremelyimpressed with Edge Chromium and the improvements to Bing. As of my experiences today, it's the fastestand smoothest web browser I have, which is a complete flip from that of the old Edge.

# Microsoft's Surface Laptop 2 Was Built for Me but You Should Buy One Too 
![Microsoft Surface Laptop 2](https://i.snap.as/r6NbXgI.jpg) 
Assuming Jesus Christ is in your thoughts this evening before yet another anniversary of his birth, I aminfinitely astonished by the truth in what I’m about to suppose with you. If the Son of God was living today,most of us have agreed for a long time now that he’d use marijuana recreationally – big fuckin whoop. Ithink it’s far more interesting and appropriate (we all know his birthday was [wholly reconfigured into aconsumerist holiday](https://www.thisamericanlife.org/47/christmas-and-commerce) long ago) to speculateon how he’d behave after finding himself inadvertently in the market for a new laptop within the ~$1000range (following a *stubbed toe whilst walking on water* incident, perhaps.) Surely, it would not be entirelyholy for him to opt in to the Foxconn-complicit world of Apple, Incorporated, nor the [openly-blasphemous](https://bilge.world/google-soul-ledger-dont-be-evil) one created and exuberantly grown by Google LLC, andI’m afraid he’d be too much of an *End User* idiot to integrate any of the sparse Linux-dedicated hardwareavailable. In May of 2017, however, Billy Gates’ old Microsoft finally released “[the laptop we’ve alwayswanted them to make](https://www.theverge.com/2017/5/5/15557738/vergecast-podcast-255-microsoft­surface-laptop-samsung-dex-i-clicked-the-doc),” but could its recent update be truly worthy of our Lourdeand Saviour? Or your newly-enrolled offspring? Should you sprint downstairs and swap out the new MacBookAir you just bought?

From an entirely valid perspective, an observer might declare my last two months of 2018 to be an outrightshameful period defined by hypocrisy and traitorous betrayals. After finally taking the time to explore the fullnarrative surrounding Linux and the bloody tale of Microsoft’s cruel genocidal destruction of countlesscreative software projects throughout computing’s adolescence (see: “[Embrace, Extend, Extinguish](https://youtu.be/TVHcdgrqbHE?t=425),”) I eventually declared myself “100% Open Source” and beganoutlining an essay designed primarily to express that *Linux is finally ready to be the operating system of thepeople* without succumbing immediately to the brand of cybercrackpot illegitimacy associated with the L-word in the minds of the general public so readily thanks to decades of misinformed, condescendingneckbeards. Such a feat would require entire new planes of cultural awareness and dialectal delicacy, yetcertainly result in zero personal reward from even the best possible outcome, yet I proceeded to ponder thesubject very deliberately all the way through October because I genuinely believed in a new democratizedfuture of computing. 2018 had been my Grand Awakening to the idyllic possibilities of Free and Open SourceSoftware (FOSS) across the whole applied spectrum from office suites to [social networks](http://bilge.world/federated/), yet – as two thousand eighteen comes to an end – I’ve managed to findmyself among the most [jaded, soul-sapped](https://youtu.be/O0RSeFcv3Qs) tech community I have yetencountered: **Microsoft Administrators**. 
Complimenting this Linux-laden culture in which I was not so long ago deeply embedded was a confused andfrustrated outlook regarding what I felt were excessive and completely idiotic sacrifices across the industry’shardware design to the greedy, gluttonous god of Lightness. It seemed only reasonable to Myself AsConsumer that the entire buying public should exclusively seek designs prioritizing greatest possibleperformance and battery life, even from portable computers and smartphones, so I assumed my perspectiveon this updated iteration of Microsoft's most laptopy Surface laptop – which exists in large part to [competedirectly with](https://www.pcmag.com/news/364728/spec-down-apple-macbook-air-vs-microsoft-surface­laptop-2) Apple's beloved (and just-updated) MacBook Air – wouldn't be at all useful. However, a few weeksago, my employer prompted me with a sweet sweet ultimatum: *for the sake of a tax break, I want to spend~$1000 on a laptop for you as soon as possible*. Yes, I know I should consider myself a very fortunate man
-this [wasn't even the first time](https://bilge.world/hp-spectre-x360-review) I'd been surprised with the"hey, I want to buy you a laptop but it has to be today" experience, and may even be considered a sort ofsequel to my *Tales of Whirlwind Manic Consumerism*, but it’s ultimately one of the most idiotic strategiesto achieve a major purchase decision and completely inadvisable for anyone on a budget. Still I was indeedthankful to be put in a nearly-identical situation of Consumer Electronic haste, and have come to be especially appreciative of the specific time I was approached as such: just one week after [Microsoftlaunched the Surface Laptop 2](https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/16/17979516/microsoft-surface-laptop­2-review-specs-price-features-windows-10). 
Considering the vast majority of its users are [trapped inside my television](https://theoutline.com/post/2923/the-popularity-of-microsoft-surface-is-the-least-realistic-thing-on­television), there’s no harm in covering the Surface brand with our virtual palm for a moment. If you’llindulge me so, you’ll notice that Microsoft has actually delivered unto us **The Laptop II** – as in, thesequel... the *successor* to *every other laptop computer* yet conceived... but does this one machine trulyrepresent the second coming of the *Notebook Christ*? Naturally, it would be a bit zealous to stand behindthis extreme statement with 100% sincerity, but there truly *are* certain elements of this PersonalComputing product's execution which do indeed will its user to expect and/or desire from others in comingyears. As I've stated before, I also simply cannot help but be jazzed by such bravado from the mouths ofeven a company with as crooked and hateful history as Microsoft's. (Note: no other technology company hasactually achieved what Microsoft historically has in this regard, and hopefully none ever will again.) 
I must be honest: it hasn't yet been two months and I've already scuffed and perhaps even *stained* thebeautiful maroon alcantara surrounding my machine’s touchable body, but it’s occurred to me that I mightdraw upon the vast library of [automotive interior tutorials](https://youtu.be/PM-FbFIBoCs) available onYouTube – and even purchase some of the alcantara care-specific products they recommend – in order to*really* maintain the exterior of the Laptop II. After all, [alcantara was undeniably car culture’s materialfirst](https://www.popularmechanics.com/cars/a9653/what-is-alcantara/). I should also confess thatobjectively, the Surface Laptop II is the best-suited computer for *my personal uses* that I’ve ever owned*or* used for any length of time. Subjectively, I don’t think all of the hardware design touches that make itso – like its keyboard layout, divine 3:2 aspect ratio, and particular I/O complement – have yet had thechance to seduce my emotional brain into truly *loving* it as much as I certainly should by any reasonablemeasure. For my own sake, I hope I’m able to fall in child-like infatuation with its magic, but in the interim, Ibelieve the coldness of my heart should hopefully preserve any useful commentary I might have to add.Though this is undoubtedly the most timely review of a hardware product I’ve ever published, I’d still askthat you indulge my perspective suggesting the importance of considering it part of a *package* with itsoperating system, considering that the whole of tech media would’ve unanimously declared it the year’s“[best laptop](https://mashable.com/review/microsoft-surface-laptop-2/)” were Apple’s aging, but stillwidely-adored MacOS absent from the frame. 
> I've tested a bunch of laptops this year, running the spectrum of 2-in-1s, Chromebooks, MacBooks,gaming laptops, etc. Everyone's needs are going to be different, which is why there's no such thing as a one­size-fits-all for laptops. But enthusiasts’ laptops aside, I strongly feel the Surface Laptop 2 is the best laptopof the year. And by that I mean the best laptop for most folks' needs. 
With as much humility as possible, I must add that I myself am *anything* but “most folks,” yet myexperience so far with the product has been one of astonishing compatibility and battery life. Usingrecommended power settings, the Surface Laptop 2 endured [**four hours and twenty-two minutes**](https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/1080514545062477825) of a workload it wasn’t particularly designedfor including heavy web browsing, image manipulation, brief audio/video capture with OBS, and moderatesubsequent editing in Audacity and OpenShot. Dan Seifert – Vox Media’s “[only Windows user](https://www.recode.net/2017/5/12/15628228/microsoft-surface-laptop-apple-macbook-air-windows-10s­dan-seifert-recode-podcast)” – reported “about seven hours” of Microsoft’s claimed 14.5, but frankly, I don’tknow what any of y’all are doin – I’m just thankful this machine is a better marathoner than any other I canrecall owning. While we’re on the subject, I consider Microsoft’s inclusion of a magnetically-attached powercable and unassuming auxiliary USB charging port on the attached power supply to be personal godsends –further evidence, even, that the Surface Laptop 2 was *actually designed to be nice to use*. For the sake ofthose readers **actually in the market for a new laptop** who’ve somehow found themselves here, though,Raymond Wong’s review for *Mashable* is the most thorough offering you’ll find – it’s quoted front andcenter on [Microsoft’s web page for the Laptop II](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/surface-laptop-2/8XQJKK3DD91B), even – but it’s important to mention that his critical comparative perspective predatesthe late launch of its ultimate competitor, [the new MacBook Air](https://mashable.com/review/apple­macbook-air/). Rather pitifully, however, his colleague’s “good, but not great” resolution suggests that Apple failed to challenge Microsoft’s relatively moderate update enough to warrant any revision, and that*Mashable* as a publication stands by my new laptop’s *Best of the Year* title, for whatever it may or maynot be worth to you. 
> If the new [MacBook Air](https://zdcs.link/zjWl1?pageview=06Fe2GZo26XvMYZgLndTadT) came in at thesame price as the old one, it would be a steal. Sure, you pay for the privilege of being able to use macOS onthe Apple ecosystem. But in years past that also meant access to cutting-edge features and design. As prettyas the MacBook Air is, there's nothing that innovative about it. In today's Apple, it seems, privilege amountsto just staying current. 
You won’t find many others who regularly invest editorial merit in publishing 2500+ word laptop reviewsanymore, which I’d concede is plenty reasonable in the Surface Laptop’s case, at least. Perhaps your firstpoint of comparative entry should be [a barely-dated conversation](https://www.recode.net/2017/5/12/15628228/microsoft-surface-laptop-apple-macbook-air-windows-10s­dan-seifert-recode-podcast) between Kara Swisher, Lauren Goode, and Dan Seifert on *Too Embarrassed toAsk* regarding the original’s odds of truly competing in the “premium laptop” segment (if you’d prefer tohear from those who struggle to take it seriously, that is.) Assuming [the original product direction of theSurface line](https://www.zdnet.com/article/what-oems-desperately-need-to-learn-from-microsofts-surface/)still stands, Microsoft doesn’t actually intend to sell at high volume, especially when it comes to this runt ofthe marque, which does not hesitate to omit itself from the popular discourse of the moment surroundingtablets as the future of all computing to which all of its siblings have [contributed so much](https://www.theverge.com/2014/5/23/5743416/microsoft-surface-pro-3-review). Though I shall alwaysremember my dearest Libel (the special edition Spectre x360 with which I built most of *Extratone*) withgreat respect and deep fondness – I think it’s even worth mounting on some sort of plinth – the significantly-cheaper Laptop II has already demonstrated true value in its “premium” segment bragging rights with *far*superior materials and build quality. If you’re looking for the prettiest possible slice of magnesium lightnessbut aren’t the sort to have followed the story of Microsoft’s first venture into personal computer productionsince it began in the last year of the Mayan calendar, it’s worth your while to read [Joshua Topolsky’sprojections of the project’s impact on the popular narrative surrounding Microsoft](https://www.theverge.com/2012/6/19/3097726/surface-microsoft-next-chapter/in/2859835) from history’sfreshest possible perspective: the eve of the first Surface tablet’s launch. 
> The entire tablet was designed in-house by Microsoft's teams, and if you believe what was said in thepresentation yesterday, design and functionality in hardware has suddenly become a big deal in Redmond.That's a big shift, and it's an important one. The announcement of the Surface shows that Microsoft is readyto make a break with its history — a history of hardware partnerships which relied on companies like Dell,HP, or Acer to actually bring its products to market. That may burn partners in the short term, but it couldalso give Microsoft something it desperately needs: a clear story. 
A pungent stigma festered from Microsoft’s history of inadequate and inelegant public relations (especiallycompared to its greatest longtime rival) has remained in relentlessly obvious orbit around every “significant”Windows and Office update for so long that its status quo has grown into a truly inhibitive force for *all*parties involved. Topolsky is unquestionably a compromising favorite of mine, but it’s hard not to decry then-CEO Steve Ballmer’s failure to comprehend Josh’s day-after insight in the *whole three months* that passedbefore [his Seattle Times interview in September, 2012](http://old.seattletimes.com/html/businesstechnology/2019168601_microsoftballmer16.html). Ultimately,The Big M is either **incapable** of understanding any alternative utopic Visions of Computing to its own,or simply **overwrought** with the same counteraspirational carelessness its culture has always dependedupon. In analytical terms regarding Ballmer’s utilization of the forum’s opportunity to finally *tell the fuckingstory*, at least, the timidity of a term like “pre-eminent software” as a viably bright new beacon in contrastwith “*people* would say we were a software company” (emphasis mine) – as if Steve-O himself doesn’teven have the power to publicly *describe his company’s function* as its #1 man – combined at the apex ofwhat was almost impressively-negligent behavior. 
> I think when you look forward, our core capability will be software, (but) you'll probably think of us moreas a devices-and-services company. Which is a little different. Software powers devices and software powersthese cloud services, but it's a different form of delivery... 
Don’t make the same mistake I did and wear yourself out trying to extract the meaning from these threesentences – there’s none to be found. Ultimately, whatever opportunity the Surface project could haveprovided for Microsoft’s identity has been vastly overshadowed by its success as last resort supercatalyst torestore *any* sense of dignity and pride within the hardware companies who produce the vehicles. In Fall2017, *The Register* [quoted industry gossip](https://www.theregister.co.uk/2017/10/04/surface/)regarding the company’s new CEO Satya Nadella and his intent to “exit the product line” because “overallthey are not making money [and] it doesn’t make sense for them to be in this business,” but newcomers tothis conversation should know that no subsequent reporting has corroborated anything but a [sustainingfuture of the line](https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/5/18125306/microsoft-fluent-design-windows-office­surface-future), though the measurable rate of innovation in Microsoft’s products continues to leave much tobe desired. Now that you’ve heard from the experts, though, allow me to expand our lens a bit and examinewhat the Surface Laptop 2’s existence suggests as per *The Present & Future of Computing*. 
## The Clam Clan 
In case I’ve yet to mention it, all of my tech writing is in substantial debt to my much-older and child-oriented siblings for providing 8 nieces and nephews over the course of 11 years – if not for any reason butthe perspective offered by the slightest observation of their day-to-day lives. In this profoundly bizarre andhistoric technological sprint our species is experiencing, the differences in their respective relationships withconsumer tech as they’ve grown up are fascinatingly… disturbingly significant. My eldest niece Abby wasborn four years after myself in 1998, and her younger sister Amber just quite three years later in 2001. Allthree of us are Aquarians who went to the same public schools (aside from 2 exceptions on my part,) andthe two sisters have been close, significant influences on each other all their lives, yet the way Abby and Iuse and think about computers differs significantly from Amber’s. Our first real PCs introduced an importantsocial and intellectual vehicle to our pre-teen lives, and both of us still “live on” our machines as youngadults. For us and many others from this short-lived microgeneration of ours, budget laptops like the DellInspirion 2200 (which served as the first “real computer” for both of us) introduced the internet and BeingOnline as a State of Being with AIM groups, MySpace, and Yahoo! chain mails before smartphones andtablets were capable of doing so. 
Amber prefers to use her iPhone for most everything and regards her computer as a tool for work – it’sbooted up and down exclusively for that purpose, which is significantly healthier than the habit Abby, myself,and many of my Online friends developed: we left our computers running and Logged On all the timebecause we were otherwise unreachable. We learned from origin to depend on them for 100% of ourcomputing tasks – from streaming Pandora to playing Flash games within six billion open browser tabs –which likely explains both our ADD and its resulting influence on the ease with which our personal computerscan distract us. As a Journalism student and professional photographer, Abby uses the new 15-inch MacBookPro, and [Insane Blogger] David Blue has spent years looking for an alternative, becoming [the first and onlyiPhone user to make extensive use of its Bluetooth keyboard support](http://bilge.world/ios-10-review­speed/) in the process, but both of us are entirely uninterested in the rest of the industry’s insistence on[convertibles](https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/2/17515896/dell-xps-2-in-1-convertible-laptop-review),[removable keyboards](https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/16/17979504/microsoft-surface-pro-6-review­tablet-features-price-windows-10-matte-black), or [‘professional’ tablets](https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/5/18062612/apple-ipad-pro-review-2018-screen-usb-c-pencil-price­features). I wish the Linux community was finally ready to drop the elitist pretenses plaguing its nerdyhistory; I wish I could finally tell someone like Abby that a machine like the [System76 Galago Pro](https://www.pcworld.com/article/3198671/linux/the-system76-galago-pro-is-a-fierce-featherweight­competitor.html) could slot itself into her workflow without losing her time or compatibility – that thereputation surrounding Linux People had finally lost most of its validity and her desire to learn more aboutcomputing as a young woman and Power User would be met with respectful and worthwhile conversationfrom their end. Unfortunately, I’ve still found some of the Old Guard to be elitist, socially behind, andjuvenilely possessive, as if computing was still the niche interest from their 1980s and 90s childhoods.Though this conversation certainly warrants its own essay in the future, I’ll just express now that it’s a realshame some folks don’t realize the entire point of making great things is ultimately to **give them to theworld**. 
The opportunity I’ve had in the past year to finally get my Linux distro frenzy over with and out of mysystem managed to both radicalize and democratize my understanding of MacOS, Windows, and Linux asthey are in the present. While I had nothing better to do, fiddling with Ubuntu Studio and Linux Mint to theextent I did throughout Spring and Summer led me to further appreciate [the value of keyboard shortcuts](https://mastodon.social/@DavidBlue/101073796864823479), gave me [my first real proficiency with acommand line](https://mastodon.social/@DavidBlue/100917824456128537), helped [globalize mycomprehension of my own technological privilege](https://anchor.fm/davidblue/episodes/Revelations-of­Network-Withdrawals-e2d7aq/a-a235vs3), reacquainted me in a huge way with both [the true history ofsoftware](https://www.reddit.com/r/vintagecomputing/comments/9hpqov/lotussmartsuite_and_the_year_2000/) andmy own personal past as [an experimental test tube baby of Microsoft’s](https://mastodon.social/@DavidBlue/100771954295147256), and helped to answer a lot of questions I’dworried over for years about why software seemed like it simply *couldn’t improve* anymore. While it’s truethat important open source projects like [ElementaryOS](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jasonevangelho/2018/09/10/elementary-os-first-impressions-a-great-linux­doorway-for-macos-users/#231f4faa4289) continue to sprout from the Linus Extended Universe and the[growing Open Source community on Mastodon](http://bit.ly/dbmastodon) is filled with brilliant, helpful,unpretentious, and remarkably curious enthusiasts (probably because many of those I’ve interacted with sofar are non-cis and/or non-white,) little ole me was able to stumble upon some totally unnecessary andexcruciatingly ignorant sociopolitical commentary by way of the white, middle-age host and his undoubtedly-white and staunchly libertarian caller on a live broadcast of the *Ask Noah Show*. (It’s not as if I haven’tsaid ignorant and very ugly things too, but I wasn’t a forty-something *father* on a semi-professional talkshow representing an entire community.) 
Essentially, I was quite frustrated and disappointed to find that **Linux is still let down most by its owncommunity**, but the operating system itself is still *much* further along on its way to becoming a realalternative for the average user than mainstream tech journalism would have you believe. However, in mycase, finally taking the time to *really* learn about Open Source computing *also* helped me understand(surprisingly) why Apple and its environment continue to be the best and most popular choice forprofessional applications. Linux Mint gave me tremendous power in enabling me to alter, specify, andredesign the most minute details of its interface, but I couldn’t have foreseen how all-consuming such powerwould be for someone like myself. In retrospect, I’ve realized that I ended up spending more time perfectingmy custom LibreOffice Writer shortcuts than I did *actually writing* – I somehow found myself in a mindstate which justified unironically creating *a shortcut for the Shortcuts menu*. Though I swore I’d neversuccumb to the bewildering hobby of collecting and exploring different Linux Distributions, it took no time atall for me to fill a folder with disc images of the installers for almost a dozen different interpretations of theoperating system after I’d made the simple concession to myself that *I’ll just try Ubuntu, that’s all*. Themost profound realization from all this (arguably otherwise wasted) time: **for a user like me, a walledgarden is actually the best place to be productive** because *apparently*, I don’t have the self-control tokeep myself from *running away* and/or fixating on completely unproductive tasks without its boundaries. Ithink this phenomenon is perhaps the worst culprit in the persistence of the aforementioned divide between“computer people” and everyone else who simply *uses* computers, as I’m sure any one of the latter couldtell you after all of five minutes with a Linus type. 
The most comprehensive and somewhat-urgent revision to illustrate the significance of this contrast from myperspective regards the exceptional iOS/MacOS markdown-based notetaking app Bear. Frankly, my own“[Word Processing Methodology](https://bilge.world/evernote-dropbox-paper-word-processing-history)”essay from June has already become problematically out of date (and therefore embarrassing) in terms ofmy own knowledge of the segment and its history. Though I promised the conversation was “done,” I’vecontinued to explore further into word processing’s history as well as its current state. “I had a go at Bear’sfree iOS experience and saw little functional difference from DayOne,” the old, negligent, cursory David Bluenoted, but if I’d simply been willing to cough up a bit more time and just $1.49 a month for [Bear Pro](https://bear.app/#pricing), I’d have spared myself such shame and realized that the hype around this appreally is 100% justified. **Bear is the most beautiful iOS app I’ve ever seen**, but I’m now also fullyqualified to declare it the most effective execution of “distraction-free” writing software to come along in thepast 25 years. Developer Shiny Frog’s secret is their perfect balance between capability and simplicity. Itturns out, [Daily Content Lord Casey Newton’s word on this matter] (https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/2/14785264/evernote-replacement-bear-app) *really was* worth morethan mine, not to mention more succinct: “Bear may look simple, but there’s power underneath the surface.” 
Those longtime Linux and Windows diehards who’ve tolerated me thus far, listen up: MacOS may be ancient,neglected, and full of incongruencies, but its single-minded methodology paired with Apple’s iCloud *reallydoes* make it the most effective and elegant environment for most people to simply *get shit done*. It’sclear that many of you have realized the importance of simplicity for compact and/or educationaldistributions, but let me just add that **the democratization of Linux provides a gargantuan developmentopportunity to make something that beats MacOS at its own game** without starting from such a shittypremise and all of its resulting compromises – all without detracting from any other technically-mindeddistributions whatsoever. *That* is the magic of *The Distro*, remember?! If you’ve existed in a similarstate of confusion to that of my entire adult life regarding the appeal of Apple products – despite havingonce been an extensive OSX user, myself – *you’re very welcome* for the insight. Instead of paying me forthe profound self-improvement I’ve just provided, try prioritizing this newfound knowledge the next time youtalk to your MacBook Pro-loving friend about their workflow. If you’re like myself, you’ll find their argumentshave magically transformed from the bewildering bullshit they’ve always seemed to be into challenges forfuture competing operating systems to surpass Apple’s old bitch and excel in because MacOS and [even itsmuch-younger iOS counterpart](https://bilge.world/siri-shortcuts-ios12-review) – as well as the billions ofpeople who depend on them – *desperately* need real competition in order to maintain their viability, muchless become what products of the world’s wealthiest company *should* be. 
Yes, the manner in which these operating systems are perceived really *is* an important discussionprompted by a product as insignificant as the Surface Laptop 2 because as you read, the industry is bracingfor another *paradigm shift* in computing, which many believe (preposterously, I might add) could be assignificant and disruptive as 2007’s introduction of the iPhone. This machine of Microsoft’s and its “new”MacBook Air counterpart could potentially be the last designs to carry us to a computing future where thetried-and-true clamshell design is forgone entirely by the mainstream, but [Apple’s release of this year’s newiPad Pro](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/oct/30/apple-new-ipad-pro-launched-all-screen­design-face-id-usb-c-processor-magnetic-keyboard) prompted even [the most Cupertino-loving](https://supercomputer.transistor.fm/13) tech commentators to respond with *genuine discord* along with afew long-overdue shouts of “*are you crazy*?!” I’m very proud of *The Verge*’s [Nilay Patel](http://twitter.com/reckless), in particular, for so eloquently deconstructing its usability for all but the verywealthy. “It is impossible to look at a device this powerful and expensive and not expect it to replace alaptop for day-to-day work,” he reminds us in the introduction to [his full review of the updated product](https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/5/18062612/apple-ipad-pro-review-2018-screen-usb-c-pencil-price­features), along with a beautifully transient sentiment which I think we all needed to hear again: “I don’tthink people should adapt to their computers. Computers should adapt to people.” Even something asconsumerist and bourgeois as the introduction of another pricepoint-burgeoning Apple hardware flagship canturn a simple tablet review into a much-needed manifesto for a user-centric way forward for the industry,which is itself worthy of celebratory encouragement. 
I’ve favored *The Verge* and its cast long past the point of excess throughout the span of my work abouttechnology, but Nilay’s review and its [accompanying episode of *The Vergecast*](https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/8/18075992/vergecast-podcast-330-ipad-pro-macbook-air-review) are*truly* special and profound gems of content that shouldn’t be passed up. Apparently – as the Editor-in-Chief immediately insists as the episode begins – his “ongoing theory” that “the more important you are, theless actually important work you do, and the more likely you are to be an iPad user” roused anger from “thatwhole class of [billionaires,]” but the experiences behind his argument actually suggest that Apple’s ownfavorite child of late – into which it has begun investing and thereby implicitly *sponsoring* over its mucholder brother as the ultimate heir of the majority’s future computing – has unequivocally **failed** to do itspart in growing the iPad Pro into the “laptop replacement” we’d all heard so much about. Of iOS 12’sperformance as an operating system beneath true work-related tasks, he exasperates “you have to spend allof your time figuring out how to do stuff instead of doing stuff,” which I couldn’t help but hear as echoes ofmy own late Linux lamentations. As thankful as I am to have finally achieved enlightenment of the PlanetApple, I’m afraid I was pitifully late: its very natural laws underwent their most brutal tests of the 21stcentury this past year. Now that I’ve finally come to adore the elegant effectiveness of a new generation ofiOS apps like Bear, I’m faced with yet another of the episode’s statements of weight: “I think it’s time to stop pretending that the future of computing looks like Apple’s restrictions.” On the opposing end of the line, theworld’s first trillion-dollar company’s *other* major product release of 2018 [managed to disappoint](https://www.engadget.com/2018/11/09/apple-macbook-air-review-2018/) even the most fanatical fans ofits original operating system’s best-selling platform with [an insultingly mediocre update to the MacBook Air](https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/6/18064552/macbook-air-2018-review-retina-keyboard-apple-features­battery-price) marque upon which it [once so fondly doted](https://www.engadget.com/2008/01/25/macbook-air-review/). 
My best friend’s parents bought her [the original Surface tablet](https://www.theverge.com/2012/10/23/3540550/microsoft-surface-review) when she enrolled in art school,and her frustration with its lackluster keyboard (among others) leads MacOS alternative-seeking users like usto wish Microsoft had started with a traditional design like the Surface Laptop first. Perhaps Apple andMicrosoft’s emphasis on their tablets is nothing but a bit premature for the *most* current crop of users, andthe rest of my nieces and nephews will expand upon an entirely different methodology of usership whenthey receive their freshman computer. Those elders of us who still take the Clamshell form seriously and loveprinting our documents are apparently facing a future industry saturated with products we can’t believe in,but it’s up to you to decide if this issue is worth expending your energy in advocacy for either camp. With my120+ word per minute proficiency with physical keyboards, *I* for one have been completely bewildered bythe iPad as anything but an indulgence for reading text on the web, and I’m pleased as punch with mySurface Laptop 2. Even if it proves to be the last new computer I’ll ever own to come as optimized for myuse, I’m just grateful and astonished it happens to be the best yet.

# Mississippi Queens 
![Mississippi Queen (Eryn Trudell)](https://i.snap.as/tf4phIq.jpeg) 
eighteen dollars will buy you an hour's passage on the worn & weary *Mark Twain* 
the same stretch under Lover's Leap, an idle paddle wheel dragged cyclically, on and on by her diesels 
costumed so long, moored not far from horrid wax figures, similarly fated who bare old Sam's names with the rest of them, the Hannibilians assuredly assuaged by their sounds, so heard 
the ambiance of the little town, shrill with tourists' wonder, depression of the damned, envisaged waterborne toxins 
despite it all, I departed her as a newfound touchstone, knowing she's just up twenty four, eighteen dollars away, no time soon to break her jaded rhythm as a forgotten timepiece, buried in a rank cellar 
supposing she'd ease most crisis that could ever befall me she and her unsalted captain, who has not aged (truthfully, I do remember.)

# ‘Mom and Dad’’s Discrepant Defense Against Stale Industry and the Population Problem ![Nicolas Cage](https://i.snap.as/HitpxbS.jpeg) ## A 'fun' movie 
The Earth will reach its maximum occupancy load (12 billion) when I am in my mid-fifities, meaning there’llbe more than twice as many gorging, shitting, shooting, complaining, and lying human beings than therewere when I started, and perhaps Brian Taylor’s *Mom and Dad* is in fact a reasoned argument for aparticular solution to our inevitable plight. I’m still not sure what a “cult” movie is, precisely, but I can’timagine what sort of cult could possibly sustain itself around the ethos of this film alone, despite its concise,agitating, at once lighthearted, yet genuinely-disturbing trip. No, it is probably not propaganda. From theexperts, you’ll get *precisely* the same review, varying only in length. *The New York Times*’ Glenn Kenny[couldn’t be bothered](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/18/movies/mom-and-dad-review-nicolas­cage.html) with more than 250 words, but RogerEbert dot com’s Simon Abrams [shelled out a whole 1000](https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/mom-and-dad-2018). They are suspiciously close to these big roundnumbers — perhaps each was written to respective quotas, and perhaps you could say all that couldreasonably be said in 10, but I don’t care. 
The tropes here are polished to a miraculous sheen — two emotionally-stunted, middleaged, overlypreoccupied-with-their-lost-youth suburban parents (Nicolas Cage and Selma Blair) who’s existing envies &irritations regarding their own classically bratty teenage girl (Anne Winters) and her mischievous little brother(Zackary Arthur) is merely agitated by a sudden TV static-bound killer instinct into bloodlust, not originated.I’m not sure any pill dealer would actually flip off their customers after a fair buy — even in high school, but*drugs*, a *black boyfriend*, and a *stinkbomb*? in the old Trans Am!? *I’m going to kill you!* 
Somebody, somewhere knew all the best sources on suburbia and how to put them to good use. The Camry,the golf bag, ping pong smashing, sweat-stained Big Sur tee, and *Dr. Oz*, for Christ’s sake! Granted,talking to your girlfriend/boyfriend on the phone at all is a bit dated — especially while riding a BMX — and Idon’t think Froot Loops are generally accepted middle-class chow anymore. These are staples from *my*youth, and I am very old. Technically, the iMessage bubble graphics are more chronographically appropriate,but with great consequence, I fear — if we’re going to accept them once and for all as authenticmechanisms for telling stories set in the present, they are going to age faster than Nick’s new jowls (unlesswe’re all soon killed by our parents.) It’s been two years since I knew anything about music, but I seriouslydoubt even the gothest fifteen?-year-old girls are listening to [Father-esque post-Memphis horrorcore](https://soundcloud.com/billsaberdotcom/iknowupussiesdontwantit) in class — there’s something aboutSoundCloud that really clashes with chokers.

If there was ever a film in which to use grimy dubstep-influenced electronic slaps, buzzes, chirps, and greatgrating clanking, it’s this one. It’s a terrific disappointment that Hollywood feels so timidly about their use ofthe most intimate medium. One forgets its potential to control the nuances of an audience’s fear, anger,discomfort, and panic beyond cheap jump scares until they experience an irritating, distressing, ghastlygross, all-possessing feat of accentuating audio production such as that of *Mom and Dad*. If you want to judge Academically the *effectiveness* of a nominee’s work for an award with a title like Best Sound Editing(as opposed to whatever the hell criteria was met most fully by *Skyfall*,) you *must* give the little goldenman to these folks, whoever they are. 
![Mom & Dad Sound Department](https://i.snap.as/CQm0cIN.png) 
When’s the last time you saw a truly, believably shitty modern parental pair on a big screen? I really can’tremember, myself. Brent and Kendall Ryan are masterpieces of character craft — both a perfect précis*and* thoroughly-defined exploration of miserable white suburbanites. They’re even *named* unimprovably,which reflects a quality in care and attention to detail that I very much appreciate. They are vain, vulgar,impatient, selfishly afraid, and careless, freely feeling and saying it all directly in front of their children. I lovebeing told explicitly which characters to hate (no joke,) and in this case it’s the whole damned lot. BrianTaylor and Nicolas Cage [scream](https://youtu.be/MSmJFMabfJc) it over and over (as I’d like to imagine) asingle afternoon of one-take filming, considering that the latter took it upon himself to first [memorize theentire screenplay](http://comicbook.com/horror/2018/01/08/nicolas-cage-mom-and-dad-movie-brian-taylor/)and its prose, vanilla to perfection, before photography began, and I hope it all stays with him forever,especially “my mom is such a penis.” 
*Mom and Dad* could conceivably be Nicolas Cage’s *I Am Legend* if for no other reason than the totallack of possible stand-ins for Brent Ryan — even the standard by which all white suburban Dadperformances have been measured in the 21st century, Jason Bateman. Nick himself [described ](http://variety.com/video/mom-and-dad-toronto-film-festival-nicolas-cage/)it as “punk rock, rebellious,irreverent, original, badass,” and the “number one” movie he’s made in the past ten years (disqualifying*National Treasure*, in case you were worried.) No surprise, I must agree — this one is a wonderfullyraucous and feral thing, but the scene involving the attempted murder of a newborn by her mother(Kendall’s sister) came very close to crossing the line. However, I am old and the intensity of my paternalinstincts has probably outpaced my understanding of them. You could also argue, of course, that pushingsuch boundaries is a core function of a film like *Mom and Dad.* Nobody ended up vomiting or anything. 
This *fun* thing shouldn’t feel as foreign as it does in cinema, but you already knew that. With all its implicitgrapples with overpopulation, kids and gun violence, class, and racism — truly, this is a film chargedelectrically with current issues. Or maybe not. Ultimately, I can at least tell you for certain that Brian Taylormade exponentially better use of his resources (I couldn’t find a solid number for its production budget) thanthe Fucking Spierig Brothers did with *Winchester* (just so you know what a disaster looks like,) andmanaged to be refreshingly original (astonishing that nobody’s had this specific idea before.) A spectacularriot, *Mom and Dad* does all you could possibly want it to do. With just eighty-three minutes to lose, it’sworth the commitment just to hear Nicolas Cage whimper and say “anal beads.”

# Stop Settling for Mono Playback 
![How Mono Playback Looks](https://i.snap.as/gbCNtnF.jpeg) 
## As dual speakers become the norm in smartphone design, let us briefly examine and explain why oneshould always expect to hear their music in stereo. 
Though I have many audiophilical sentiments and preferences, I cannot — by conscience — fully claim the title
because I’ve never been able to justify the allotment of funds necessary for the obligatory equipment. (Andmy digital compressor usage in the production of [*Drycast*](http://extratone.com/drycast) and[*Futureland*](http://extratone.com/futureland) has been manifestly vulgar.) That said, audio engineering isone of the few topics which I can actually speak on with almost-academic authority, and mypretentiousness-capacitated preoccupation with quality-of-life compels me to bring up a ludicrously-rationalstandard that most of us have continued to undershoot for far too long. 
Two weeks ago, the abundantly-rumored omission of the 3.5mm audio port in the iPhone 7 was finallysettled. We played our own part in feeding the “controversy,” yeah, but I believe Apple was actually quitetardy in labeling smartphone-bound analog audio as archaic, though I’m not going to waste words in that
discussion — it is definitely oversaturated, at this point — because I think mono audio is an even more
prevalent topic. 
Honestly, out of all the missing features we’ve lamented over in the past decade, stereo speakers should’ve
been the most aggravating. The gigantic difference, of course, is that the industry (and — by muddledextension — the consumers) has been all but silent in that regard. I write you, now, because we should all be
colossally disappointed with ourselves. 
Two channels. Left and right. Read: [Mono vs. Stereo](http://www.diffen.com/difference/Mono_vs_Stereo)
But why should you care? What if Google — somehow — failed to provide you with a significant difference? 
One channel of sound is — in terms of locale — rigidly static in your perception. Doubling the data creates a
spectrum, adding **dimensionality**, which is infinite, ya know. Playing back audio in stereo, through twoor more diaphragms (the fundamental hardware unit of sound reproduction,) now enables the exhibition of**audio pictures**. 
If this is entirely new to you, I want you to do something. Find yourself a pair of headphones or a set of twoor more computer speakers. (If these aren’t available, consider your car’s sound system. If it’s at all currentand healthy, it’s gonna do the trick.) Bother to discover “**L**” and “**R**.” That is, left and right. Orientaccordingly. Download [this 37-second clip](http://www.extratone.com/media/bikefest2016preview.wav) Irecorded at [BikeFest](http://www.extratone.com/audio/bikefest/) with my Zoom H2n. (Be advised: thepreview is formatted in 5.1 surround, so it’s a very large file for its playback length.) Listen, obviously, andthen listen again on your singular smartphone “loudspeaker.” 
**That’s what I’m talking about.** 
Why am I being so abashedly patronizing? Why am I transgressing against our particular assumptions about
you — the informed, savvy millennial audience? Because the vast majority of playback I hear in day-to-day
life is still from a singular diaphragm; a singular source. 
A topical example: *I am shown a YouTube video on an iPhone*. (A pre-iPhone 7 device, that is.) 
*Walking downtown, I pass a small band of adolescent skateboarders listening to Cannibal Ox on a SamsungGalaxy Note.* 
Worst of all: *I find myself watching a Netflix film on my iPhone, in bed, not having bothered to wear the$200 pair of QC15s sitting within arm’s length.* 
Informed or not, **consumers are neglecting audio**, and dimensionality, alone is worth a change. Recentyears have allowed the unlimited bandwidth assumption to become habit, so even the vast majority of
today’s spoken word programs (like podcasts) — which, in general, stay in the “center” of their mix, makinglittle to no use of the left-right spectrum — are produced in stereo, now. In many cases (including a few of
ours,) this doublesizing is often for the sake of introductory themes, alone. If you care to imagine a moredata-frugal society, the “waste” is ridiculous. It is not unrealistic to expect such a reality in the near future,but the same holds true for the reverse. 
In the present’s abundance, though, the result is simply a decrease — as a whole — in playback’s “full
experience,” if the hardware is not changed. Imagine how great it’d be if a digital audio formatting standardcould be developed that’d enable a singular file to be mono or stereo, if needed/utilized, to trim offredundancy, sorta like variable bit rate. Get on that, would ya? 
So, why haven’t we become more diligent about our sound experiences? 1 billion iPhones in circulation, allwith mono playback by default, are suspect culprits, I think. Of course, there are other devices, but none as
influential — even the iPod, funny enough — on fundamental digital functions like music playback. And
honestly, when is it appropriate or suave to take the extra steps? 
> *I want to show you this song. Let me untangle my headphones… Yes, okay. Put them in. I’m going to sithere in silence for four minutes, looking into your eyes as you listen to the entirety of this track.* 
It’s never going to be socially acceptable. But what about wireless alternatives? Apple’s new Air Pods lookabsurd, but their by-computing optimization of the Bluetooth audio standard is revolutionary, in a small way,in [propelling](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/sep/25/hearables-iphone-7-airpods-bragi-the­
dash-revolution) the “hearables” paradigm into the mainstream, if only for a moment. If — in a strangely­audiocentric future — we are *always* wearing multipurpose sound reproduction devices in our ears, perhaps
the waste of the Mono Monstrosity will be finally resolved. Until then, I suppose all we can do is give it anextra thought, for our own quality-of-life’s sake.

# Nissan Murano CrossCabriolet: The Ego Divide ![Just Really Lame](https://i.snap.as/9ZxzF2f.jpg) ## The recently-discontinued Nissan Murano CrossCabriolet darkly mirrors sentiments first begun with the
Pontiac Aztek, narrating Generation X’s decline. My Nissan wheeltime for [*Honk*](https://medium.com/r/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fextratone.com%2Fhonk)has grown a massive respect for the brand’s audacity within me. My interest in the profession has spanned
years of maturity — from asking *can’t you just…?* to active affection for those who dare reliably retort with
a confident *no*. *Can’t you just retire your body-on-frame SUV entries already like everybody else did ten years ago?* The noble, rugged Xterra, which we shall sincerely miss. *Can’t you just follow the Golf’s unquestionably low-risk lead into the tumultuous youth market?* The Juke NISMO, which we regard as the industry’s singular steady grasp on what youth actually means. *Can’t you just take some cues from Honda and Toyota, and make your sedans easy on the eye?* The Altima and the Maxima, which constitute the last truly evil marque available. *Can’t you just step a little lighter on the Versa’s margins? You’d be insane to build a car designed by MSRP
alone!* 
The Versa is — for better or worse — the absolute essence of automobiles’ transportive function, and no more. 
And there’s the GT-R, of course, which continues to make fools of an entire culture of self-titled “gearheads”who claim speed as their one true dowry. ![CrossCabriolet Blur](https://i.snap.as/5B0USDq.png) Throughout the years, Nissan has over and over again made me look like an absolutely absurd idiot for your
display — and I cannot think of a better gift. Of all the brands to misunderstand, it is the ultimate muse. 
So, in the present, I am grandiosely assuming you’ve been attentive enough to deliberate the possibleoutcomes of our time with the Murano CrossCabriolet. 
It was quickly apparent that the experience was not going to resemble our [*Night of the Juke*](https://medium.com/r/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2FJukeHonk) in the slightest. It could be attributed tomy pre-game mentality. For the first time, I came to this monstrosity thinking I’d finally learned my
lesson,desperately hoping to be whipped again — real bad — but walk away with more closure than with
which I arrived. Like a good diplomat, I made myself approach without want for anything but understanding. On first take, the Xterra was proud, and the Juke was clever. The CrossCabriolet is a corny joke. Take a look at an [occupied, top-down example from afar](https://www.instagram.com/p/BEkCgv4w7nf/). I
cannot think of a more ridiculous picture. ![CrossCabriolet Driver](https://i.snap.as/33VTAOj.jpg) Just since its assembly in 2011, our example’s trim has endured enough to begin disintegrating in a few 
bizarre locales. Not to over-iterate, but it’s needing strong mention: I had never sat in a roofless crossoverbefore. I’m assuming you haven’t, either. It is unnatural. It is harrowing. 
From the organization I have summed so many times over the years as “acutely ingenious” came this…
unsettling suburban bathtub. 
It’s a shame — I repeatedly remark on the extrapolated potential I can see in a *roofed* Murano. Everything
else in sight is worth my time. If only it had been better-protected. 
The sensation is simply ridiculous in what’d be a tasteful sense were this a one-off project of some hearty
garage tinkerer or tuning shop, but… my God; Nissan delivered it this way, and had the gall to ask $10,000
more for their molestation. 
Still, its [webpage](https://medium.com/r/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nissanusa.com%2Fcrossovers%2Fmurano-crosscabriolet) (in past tense, thankGod,) proclaims “the Murano CrossCabriolet was the world’s first and only All-Wheel Drive convertiblecrossover” in the same language I’d tout the Xterra (may it rest in peace and eternally-inadequate glory) asthe last available SUV, in the traditional use of the segment, or the Juke NISMO as the first competently-composed automotive product for millennial youth. Or the GT-R as by far the most effective, high-valueinstrument for the pursuit of maximum velocity across the ground. And so on. 
![Pontiac Aztek Concept](https://i.snap.as/xLnWxFe.webp) 
The language so assured, the parallels must inevitably be drawn to that cheap joke of the century’s turn…
the Pontiac Aztek. 
The details of its life story are reliably amusing, should you find yourself mid-research. From the journos’gasps at its corporately-edgy concept’s unveiling to the weary original steed of *Breaking Bad*‘s Meth Man,there is a similar *lifestyle vehicle* thread between the products that weaves an obscure narrative. 
My own contribution: after a missed exit outside Galveston just as Azteks first became rentable, mystepfather (the most earnestly late-history Pontiac man who ever lived) took an entirely-unexpected anduncharacteristic 70 mile-an-hour plunge into the choppy grass median after shouting “this is an off-roadvehicle!” 
As I’m sure you can imagine, it was the single most traumatic event I have ever experienced as thepassenger of a motor vehicle, but the damned thing was unscathed, despite having repeatedly chucked usall (fully-belted) into its beige ceiling. 
Gary believed in Pontiac. 
Though he was keen enough to smell death, he chose to believe in the Aztek. 
And you know what? His faith, too, has made me look like an idiot. 
That’s what separates the Aztek from ye late CrossCabriolet: it really was a genuinely-*bold* innovation.Survive the laymen’s idle party chat and crude design critiques, and you’ll find an impressive clarity in itspurpose, especially given the context of its conception. In the used market especially, it *still* represents a
characterful, practical, and high-value consideration. And yet — at the expense of themselves — Americanbuyers did not clamor for it like the informed of the populace did. Perhaps it was because the informed — likethen-*BusinessWeek*‘s David Welch — were [echoing](https://medium.com/r/?
url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bloomberg.com%2Fnews%2Farticles%2F2000-12-17%2Fgms-aztek-born-to-be­a-little-too-wild) hopes of a “design renaissance” for General Motors. The renaissance that would not comeuntil the Flush of the Boomer Higher-Ups some eight years later. 
Both tales, I think, represent a profound neglect of consumer journalism. 
At the turn of the century, though, it was not unusual to go a day without accessing the internet. Today,
people are *still buying* the few flops the industry has left to offer — making what is most likely the second-
largest purchase of their life’s current epoch without consulting the *volumes* of diverse, intelligent, andarticulate opining now accessible instantly *free of charge* via the subsidized slates that lightly jostle in theirjean pockets as they wiggle their signatures on dealer paperwork.

**ALERT**: Inbound tennis enthusiasts! 
Funny, isn’t it? 
An American hit when the Japanese were unquestionably winning, and — just over a decade later — aJapanese miss as their winning had just begun to be questioned. Make no mistake; I am not being patriotic.
For me, sovereignty does not extend beyond design houses, R&D facilities, and test centers.And it’s
somewhere within Nissan’s where pillars were severed and delusions nurtured; all astoundingly with
executives’ blessing. I am terribly and shockingly ashamed to report that my countrymen *actually boughtthem*. 
As many as 3300 units in the last year of the Mayan calendar. The worst bit, though, is that they *all* madetheir way to my particular part of the planet.

I swear to the Sun; I am surrounded. 
If you’re familiar with Columbia, Missouri, it does not take more than a moderate imagination to comprehend
the sense, as grueling as it is. I see them regularly; once a month, at least. In a town where one can expect
to spot a Gallardo in front of Buffalo Wild Wings marred by horrid plastic athletic miniflags wedged in its five-figure doors, they are everpresent reminders that the New Money Effect continues to flourish, unbridled inthe Midwestern U.S. 
The soft top is *always* retracted, of course, and the exposed driver is *always* a sweating middle-aged
white woman wearing a light-colored tennis visor. She… *they*… are *always* on their way to a match.
Doomed to roast forever, I suppose, as there is only one nearby court, as far as I know. 
It is disheartening to realize that, now, I see many more of them than Azteks around. Though neither weredesigned for any *tangible* “lifestyle,” per se, I am saddened by the shift this minuscule tell indicates in myhometown’s morale. From an (albeit equally-vague) yearning for new adventure in an intriguing new centuryto an emotionally-destitute jaunt to *the court*, I have witnessed all of Generation X’s vigor erodeprocedurally away before my eyes.

Y2K, Great Depression II, an ancient apocalyptic prophecy from one of the wisest civilizations in recorded
history… *Surely, one of these foretold disasters will finally End it All!* 
Perhaps Nissan knew that even the well-read of the North American market were, by and large, simplylooking for ways to pass the time before the death which they felt so assuredly approached. The number ofunanimously-unbuyable prospects available has shrunken to virtually none, and the CrossCabriolet was not
much of an investment; not all that highly-engineered, really. Perhaps they felt obligated to entertain us in
our delusional *way out*. Perhaps it was all just an awfully-German prank.

## A not altogether-cohesive review of July reads and research.**In case you're similarly long overdue for a reminder that beautiful things are still being made on theinternet...** 
After nearly a year of relative sobriety from my old, once-severe addiction to Web Site hunting, it occurred tome just yesterday that some explicit wandering as I once did for days at a time - through the clever,innovative, and uniquely tasteful projects through which an astonishingly-original few give their wholethinking (and often physical) selves in obscurity despite how little financial (and often professional) incentiveis maintained by those who unknowingly need it the most - might be the best feasible remedy to my current,most perplexing state of faithlessness and bafflement toward the ambitions of trades and cultures I feel Ionce so thoroughly understood. A great portion of you are surely undergoing your own manifestations of thesame hopelessness - I cannot *ever* remember a time in my life when global events were so *utterly*discouraging so relentlessly. 
## Design and The Open WebIn this present when every element of American reality is so much more incessantly ugly than we could’veever imagined, let’s take at least a momentary respite to look at some visually irresistible and/or *super sick*Sites on the truly-resolute Open Web to assure our existential selves that *yes, beauty shall not cease toexist*. For better or worse, my #1 goto source to find innovative, delicious web design has always been*Typewolf*, who [announced last fall](https://www.typewolf.com/blog/goodbye-to-favorite-sites-posts) thathe will not be continuing his “Site of the Month” section, though his relentless “[Site of the Day](https://www.typewolf.com/site-of-the-day)” roll will continue, unhindered.

## Audio Those of us for whom the Podcast medium became a trusted and relatively regular one in our lives longbefore anyone figured out how to make a real business out of it - certainly *[eons](https://www.macworld.com/article/1048271/podcastword.html)* preceeding the original startup podcast-only (apparently [HBO-like](https://www.niemanlab.org/2015/07/gimlet-wants-to-become-the-hbo-of­podcasting-heres-what-its-founders-learned-trying-to-get-there/) publication - [Gimlet Media](https://observer.com/2015/02/gimlet-media/) - to be successfully launched.

Whilst trying out [Garageband for iOS’](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/garageband/id408709785) newsample packs, I sampled the [accompanying video](https://youtu.be/DvisTHAvaIE) to the article andproduced [the best “track” I’ve ever made with the app](https://soundcloud.com/chordoslut/everyone-has-a­podcast-none-but-god-are-listening/s-ICt6x) (for whatever that’s worth.) 
*Speaking of* Gimlet Media: [the latest episode](https://gimletmedia.com/shows/reply-all/xjhx3l/146­summer-hotline) of my longtime favorite of their podcasts, *Reply All*, is a sort of condensed remake of [myfavorite podcast episode of all time](https://gimletmedia.com/shows/reply-all/llhezj) (of any show, not justthis one) in which hosts [Alex Goldman](https://twitter.com/AGoldmund) and [P.J. Vogt](https://twitter.com/PJVogt)maintained an open telephone line for 48 hours and spoke with a whole bunchof people (mostly Americans) about... whatever. The result was beautifully *human*, if you’ll forgive my useof the cliche. I tend to revisit it when I’m feeling particularly isolated from and/or confused about the generalambitions of the people around me. I’ll be honest: I didn’t pay much attention to my first listen through thenew episode, but I can tell you that it is worth your time, at least. 
I was distraught when Spotify bought both the aforementioned Gimlet Media *and* [the social audio turnedpodcasting app Anchor](https://medium.com/anchor/anchor-is-joining-spotify-70356e3ac23f) - both of whichI (rather ridiculously) felt a special personal ownership over. (The latter, especially, because they reachedout to me early on to feature [*Extratone*’s channel](http://anchor.fm/extratone) on their music section.)However, it appears that both are being treated fairly well in the 18+ months since their acquisition ­probably because [they’ve been making Spotify money](https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/31/20748337/spotify-earnings-q2-2019-podcasting-growth-users­subscribers).

# Philip Roth, *American Pastoral* 
You fight your superficiality, your shallowness, so as to try to come at people without unreal expectations, without an overload of bias or hope or arrogance, as untanklike as you can be, sans cannon and machine guns and steel plating half a foot thick; you come at them unmenacingly on your own ten toes instead of tearing up the turf with your caterpillar treads, take them on with an open mind, as equals, man to man, as we used to say, and yet you never fail to get them wrong. You might as well have the *brain* of a tank. You get them wrong before you meet them, while you're anticipating meeting them; you get them wrong while you're with them; and then you go home to tell somebody else about the meeting and you get them all wrong again. Since the same generally goes for them with you, the whole thing is really a dazzling illusion empty of all perception, an astonishing farce of misperception. And yet what are we to do about this terribly significant business of *other people*, which gets bled of the significance we think it has and takes on instead a significance that is ludicrous, so illequipped are we all to envision one another's interior workings and invisible aims? Is everyone to go off and lock the door and sit secluded like the lonely writers do, in a soundproof cell, summoning people out of words and then proposing that these word people are closer to the real thing than the real people that we mangle with our ignorance every day? The fact remains that getting people right is not what living is all about anyway. It's getting them wrong that is living, getting them wrong and wrong and wrong and then, on careful reconsideration, getting them wrong again. That's how we know we're alive: we're wrong. Maybe the best thing would be to forget being right or wrong about people and just go along for the ride. But if you can do thatâ€”well, lucky you.

# Why I Write About Technology 
## A largely-biographical overview of my personal history with technology and its contributions to mycurrent perspective. 
Incalculable odds were against my arrival in this world happening in early 1994, positioning my life within atimeline that would allow me to bridge my two species’ most significant millenniums in the first grade as astudent in the first class at Fairview Elementary school to receive curriculum-mandated exposure to brand-new Windows 98 PCs in its brand-new, fluorescent-lit computer lab in the center core of its 50-year-oldrectangular brick structure. The lab also meant that ours was the first Fairview class to have the availablerelief of air conditioning during the school day. It’s unlikely that I would be home sick and watching the lasttelevision ever allowed in my mother’s living room as the second plane hit. 
My peers and I would form a picogeneration without a name (perhaps we should be called the 9/11ers) —
91s and 92s wouldn’t have regular access to public school machines until they’d eclipsed the true prime oftheir development, and were just that much further along, mentally, to being able to comprehend the huge
and terrifying concepts of 1) New York and 2) burning alive — while 98s like my niece were spared any such
comprehension of death at all, yet now have to face the existentially future-sundering, darkly-mirroredreality of the Trump Presidency during the most critically uncertain period in the last stage of their brain’stransition to adulthood. 
If there is truth in the cross-cultural supposition that souls have some sort of choice, pre-conception, overwhen they’re born, my own must have either cleaned out the house, or lost horrible, though I suspect I’llnever be able to confidently wager either way. This question of *how lucky or unlucky am I to be alive right
now* is one which I find most fascinating — not just within myself, but within others my age. I declare us a
generation largely because of my experiences on the assumption that my mid-Missouri upbringing representsthe ultimate average in the American experiences of the time as the area has been a reliable sample of theclearest average of the country’s cultural, political, and economic life. Technically, it was quite unlikely that Iarrive here as a new human being instead of China or India, and what if that, too was my choice? 
Though less so, it was still against chance that I would be born to parents who would divorce very quicklyafter my birth, before my mind was able to form any tangible long-term memories, sparing me whateverpain could’ve resulted from their greater togetherness later nullified in front of me. I could’ve chosen themas well for the variety of experiences their situation would allow me as I grew up between my father’s 800­acre farm and my mother’s suburban house in Columbia, the college town an hour’s drive south. I write
about my experiences now — so young — because I’ve likely already born witness to more extraordinary
changes in human development than your parents, their parents, and their parents’ parents combined. At24, my life has already spanned by far the most profound and expedited informational renaissance in human
history — greater progress was made between the day I first rode a bicycle and the one on which I took my
driver’s test than in thousands of years before it. 
My father’s experiences between 1950 and 1974 — from his birth until the age I am now — would indeed
include watching a man set foot on a spatial body other than Earth for the first time, but would be mostlydefined by work on the family’s soybean, corn, and wheat farms in central Illinois, driving carbureted tractorspulling cultivating equipment of the same basic design and function as had been pulled by horses, mules,
and oxen for hundreds of years, and other implements — like the mechanical multi-row planter — that were
new technology at the beginning of the century. For neighbors, he would walk behind the path of a squarehay baler next to a moving flatbed trailer upon which he would throw the 70–100 lb. rectangles of deadcompacted grass by their twine through thick cowhide gloves. All of this I would get to experience in thenext century on *his* farm, using the exact same equipment. 
At home, he would watch NBC, ABC, and CBS on a CRT television, as I would for several years until wirelesstelevision was legally transitioned to digital statewide in the summer of 2009. As an adolescent, he wouldform a business with friends cleaning out old abandoned barns in exchange for the rights of ownership toanything they found inside, which led to his discovery of a hay-preserved 1929 Buick Sedan containing hand­written records of its every service. This car would change hands into his Uncle’s care as he went off to school in Champaign, married and farmed in Georgia, and eventually settled on the flat clay soil of the farmwhere I grew up right on the border between Audrain and Monroe counties, Missouri. I was about 10 whenwe drove back to the family hub with a trailer in tow to collect the car from my Great Uncle, to my manicexcitement. 
Up until my mid-teens, my life was defined by my extreme reverence for historic cars, airplanes, tractors,and watercraft, and the time I spent operating, maintaining, restoring, or simply studying the assortment of
these which I was allowed — often because of extraordinary circumstances — would build the part of my
psychology which seeks to experience different cultures, ideas, and eras through the medium of engineeringand design and relies on these to understand them. Like my father in his youth, I would learn to clean waterout of a carburetor after the Oliver had sat without running for two long, and I would pee in a chamber potin order to avoid waking up my Grandfather by walking down the attic stairs and turning the lights on. Iwould learn how to shoot and drive before 10-years-old, and I would have the freedom to do both as Ipleased on the miles of gravel roads that ran around home. 
Though my stepfather bought me a PC of my own just as my first grade computer class was ending, I couldnot conceive of a reason to take up the dial-up line and block his incoming calls or faxes, so my use of themachine was limited to sparse writing and aggravating attempts to run Microsoft Flight Simulator 98 atapproximately one frame per second on a 300MHz single-core Pentium II CPU. Though I was *extremely*fortunate compared to most middle-class kids my age at the time to have my own computer in my room, myrelationship with it was not an emotional or particularly involved one. I would leave it powered down forweeks at a time until my last two grades at Fairview, when homework assignments began to require it. 
Perhaps the greatest gap between my mostly-suburbanite classmates and I was an exposure to Japaneseentertainment and video games. I was once disallowed from a lunch table because I’d never heard ofPokémon or Luigi, but I *did* have a Sony Playstation at home on which I occasionally loaded *A Bug’s Life*to wander around its first level. In self-imposed isolation from children my age, I wouldn’t develop any needto be socially competitive with video games as many of my peers would to carry with them into adulthood. Ithought my interests in mechanical engineering to be above all of them, so I spent my time alone with heavypicturebooks on 20th century cars, tractors, and airplanes. 
On the farm, my consistently agriculturally-proactive father was one of the first to have satellite internet forfarm futures and weather reports on a pre-GUI machine which I don’t remember. As I was becomingcomputer literate in school, he would become extremely frustrated with the Windows XP-running machinehe’d bought from a one-man, one-room computer shop in Centralia, and I would often solve some problemwith bloatware or the goddamned printer. He would also subscribe to and install a first-generation DirectTVreceiver, which had the first on-screen program guide I’d ever seen. In the evenings, I would watch hours of*Modern Marvels* on The History Channel, which presented the history, abstract functional theory, and
implementation of a particular technology, both past and future. This one program — which has aired nearly700 episodes since 1995 — is probably responsible for the majority of my at least rudimentary general
knowledge in a variety of historic and “future” technological schools, and my curiosity about culture’srelationship with innovation. 
Though my father’s interests differed significantly from mine — he thought more about growing and raisingthan of the tools one used to do it — he would indulge my many questions about how engines, hydraulics,
and electrical systems worked and my curiosity by exposing me to the hidden communities of the mostelderly, most obscure historic machinery enthusiasts like those of the Midwest Old Threshers Reunion in
Mount Pleasant, Iowa — the Concours d’Elegance for antique tractor and reciprocating engine collectors. Itwas a similar event closer to home where I first operated a steam tractor — great, field-going locomotive-like
vehicles that supplanted a need for horsepower in the late-1800s up until the Great Depression which chug,whistle, and puff along just like rail locomotives with a big iron steering wheel. As I recall, I was also given
the opportunity to drive an unrestored Model T truck around the grounds that day — the knowledge from
which I gained I cannot imagine being of much use ever again. 
I was proud to the point of arrogance of my technical knowledge and experience in all the different things Ihad driven and operated, which my schoolmates were in no position to understand. I was elitist and anti­social about this as late as 9th grade, when I had just moved in to stay with my mother, who bought me a first generation iPhone which I proudly wore in a leather belt holster to Junior High. It would represent ashift in my fascination from very old technology toward the present and future. 
I started talking online with a friend I’d first met years before at Fairview who spent most of his time fiddlingwith his first-generation MacBook Pro and first exposed me to gadget bloggers on YouTube like Mark Watsonand Jon Rettinger (both of whom are still full-time tech personalities.) My mom bought me a 13-inchaluminum-bodied MacBook (which would be sold as MacBook Pro after a single year,) and my lifestyleradically shifted inside my room, my computer, and my Xbox 360. My friend and I would both obsesstogether over software, design, and gadgets and experiment with our own tech YouTube channels until highschool, where I would be adopted by a new friend group who would finally socialize me. 
Recently, I have written about the contrasts and discrepancies of consumer technology development as itsprogress has disconnected from the upward linear trajectory in use, quality, and genuine innovation for theenduser in a departure which has been especially visible from my perspective as an academically-untrained,but intensely demanding user in the past five years. When hardware was still the industry focus before~2012, there was a tremendous amount of optimism among journalists and enthusiasts because eachsuccessive generation of devices had added more tangible capabilities. Publications like *Gizmodo* and*Engadget* made a fortune publishing reviews and comparison tests of hardware offerings across everysegment of tech, and the discourse they generated had a noticeable influence on design. I remember thistime well because it was happening throughout my last few years before adulthood when I had plenty ofspare time, energy, and curiosity to keep up. 
The story of consumer technology since Steve Jobs’ death has become increasingly more about thecompanies who design and sell hardware and software than about how and why their consumers actuallyuse them, and the result has been a series of new types of products that have little defensible place in alinear timeline of innovation, especially where productivity is involved. Augmented and Virtual Reality arequite explicitly an escapist industry which has yet to fill any significant need which was before unfilled. The
same could be argued about voice assistants and smartwatches — neither of which *remove* obstacles in
most users’ day-to-day lives but instead *contribute* to the array of tasks and devices which already seektheir attention. 
Of course, there are defensibly sound business incentives behind the industry’s new, fragmented direction,but I would also argue that there are those, too, for genuinely revisiting both what we should be doing andwhat we should be seeking to learn to do with technology. In a more abstract sense, I have written aboutwhether or not we should want to be living in this particular now, and how the way we feel about the futureshould inform what we do in the present. 
I cannot help but observe human progress from a perspective of powerlessness, acute alienation, andamused awe which has already lent to a significant quantity of occasionally original thoughts as I watchhaving experienced an odd diversity of American life and culture. I’ve published them to entertain and todemonstrate a few methods of reflection on what it is *you* really want from the times you are living.

I know how it looks… because I’ve run into many of them and have been just asirritated as you. In fact, I would be so bold as to presume I’ve run into *many many* more than you havesimply because a primary hobby of mine has always been Just Trying to Do Things On The Computerwithout any academic authority or hands-on training. This is a way of life for my generation and thoseproceeding it, yes, but I promise you that I have gone far, far deeper than the vast majority of anyone youknow. What I’m ultimately trying to do here is to spare you the hundreds – perhaps *thousands* – of hoursI have had to spend mulling through shitty workflows throughout my childhood and adulthood before Istumbled upon Good Practices (i.e. Better Ways to Do Things.)

I want you to come away from this list feeling as liberated and powerful as I do now when I’m On MyComputer without any condescension or tedium. Unfortunately, there’s probably going to be some of both,so please stick with me and don’t take it personally. I do *a lot* of online reading, writing, and fiddling. I’vebeen compelled to do these things in one form or another since very early childhood, and what follows couldbe described as a list of my favorite tools to accomplish things. Almost all of them are entirely free to useand the vast majority of them are easily and beautifully functional as well. They are what I suggest for myown mother to use, for what that’s worth, and I would argue sincerely for their extreme importance. *Don’twaste your life on bad software.* 
![Enpass Password Manager](https://i.snap.as/fJirMl4.png) 
## You Need a Password Manager 
In 2020, password managers are no longer optional for digital life. **They are mandatory**. If you onlyever heed a single piece of my advice, ever, *please* make it this one. [Most password managers available](https://www.pcmag.com/picks/the-best-password-managers) are secure, cross-platform, optionally cloud-synced tools that help you generate, store, and organize digital credentials. More likely than not, you’realready using one in your favorite browser. On MacOS and iOS, Safari is linked to a service called Keychain,which is – functionally – a robust password manager. On signup for a given website or service, Safari shouldprompt you to automatically generate secure, complex passwords to store in Keychain. Generally, it’s prettysmart about knowing when it’s time to retrieve the credentials with Touch-ID, but for when it *isn’t*, youshould know [how to manually retrieve passwords from Keychain](https://support.apple.com/guide/keychain-access/what-is-keychain-access-kyca1083/mac). If you’re deeplyenough embedded into the Mac ecosystem, you can feel free to continue to rely on this process as long asyou know how to help yourself when it fails. I’m not going to tell you who to trust, but I do *almost* actuallybelieve in Apple’s commitment to securing user data, if only because of the way their incentives are aligned(in contrast with those in front of data-funded organizations like Google.) 
If you’re using a Windows Home Machine and/or an Android smartphone, I believe it’s more urgent that youfind a standalone password management solution immediately. I use a gorgeous app called [Enpass](https://www.enpass.io/) to store all of my passwords as well as my bank credentials, credit cards, driver’slicense information, and anything else I might need to keep handy, securely. I can use virtually any cloud orfile-sharing service to keep my “vaults” synced between all of my devices: Microsoft OneDrive, Google Drive,Dropbox, iCloud, Box, etc, and I also regularly create encrypted local backups just in case. I can even*share* end-to-end encrypted credentials with another device or Enpass installation. I migrated to Enpasstwo years ago after using [1Password](https://www.consumerreports.org/password-managers/best­password-managers-review-digital-security-privacy-ease-of-use/) for nearly 10. It was intuitive and virtuallyseamless, as such things in software tend to be these days, and as a result, I haven’t had to memorize asingle password since my adolescence. Enpass allows me to create custom login templates for quick differentiation when creating new entries as well as picturized categories and tags. With one click, even theicon can be pulled from a given URL’s favicon to help keep my vault looking visually itemized. It also includespresets for a hundred services or so – from Google to Wix to Yahoo! Japan.

## Total Recall with a Clipboard Manager 
Imagine if everything you had ever copied (as in **Ctrl-C**) were listed in linear order, [easily and instantlysearchable](https://vimeo.com/407790756) via a single global keyboard shortcut (**Alt-`**) and navigablewith the arrow keys. Imagine if you could then export an archive of your clipboard so *nothing* could everbe lost. Imagine clipboard *tabs* that are easily switchable. [CopyQ](https://hluk.github.io/CopyQ/) – an“advanced clipboard manager” – is one of my favorite software discoveries of all time. Some workdays, I useit literally hundreds of instances in my workflow. It is difficult to describe how much more useful it makes theclipboard feature – something we’ve all been using for decades, now. For someone like me who [copies aridiculous amount of links every day](https://extratone.com/three-years-of-good-reads), CopyQ’sfunctionality has truly become *life-changing*. 
![Windows 10 Keyboard Shortcuts - General](https://i.snap.as/G4JSrQb.png) 
## Alt-D and Other Keyboard Shortcuts 
Somehow, I did not discover **Alt-D** until 2018, which means that I had spent the entirety of my 24 yearssince *triple-clicking* to select every single URL I’d ever copied. I built a media company this way, and Ican’t believe nobody told me about this shortcut. Open any given web browser, use **Alt-D**, and yourselection will move to the URL in the address bar on top of the page. It’s very possible this will be of littleuse to you, but anyone who regularly shares or copies links will save themselves *so* much time. I felt thesame way when I discovered text navigation with **Alt**, **Shift**, **Ctrl** + the arrow keys. Most ofthese are cross-platform, but I am specifically focusing on [Windows shortcuts](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12445/windows-keyboard-shortcuts) for this piece because that’swhat I’m currently using. 
### Arrow key-related shortcuts 

· **Shift** in conjunction with the arrow keys selects text in a document surrounding the cursor. 
· **Alt** in conjunction with the arrow keys allows one to go forward or backward in a browser. 
· **Ctrl** in conjunction with the arrow keys allows one to navigate text by word. 
Virtually all of the “Windows logo key” shortcuts are usable in day-to-day workflows. I use **Win-D** toimmediately minimize all windows and show the desktop on the regular. Microsoft is [currently testing](https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/17/21224904/microsoft-windows-10-launcher-powertoy-spotlight-alfred­details) a feature like MacOS’ spotlight which is triggered with this key. 
> Designed to replace the existing Win + R shortcut, the new launcher will include options to quickly searchapps and files across Windows and support for plugins like calculators, dictionaries, and search engines. 
We can only hope this feature will be as useful as spotlight (which is triggered with **.-Spacebar** for youMac users,) and will be implemented as standard as soon as possible. If you’re not already using basicshortcuts for functions like closing tabs/windows and cut/copy/pasting text, I’d advise you to begin as soonas possible. It can be hard to commit, but I promise it’ll make your life better. Try printing out a list ofshortcuts for your particular operating system to keep by your workspace and/or find or create an image ofthe list to set as your [desktop background](http://extratone.wiki/net/index.php/s/2Pn5H32yYYrm3bG) for a while. 
## Learn Markdown Immediately 
While we’re on the subject of text – and hopefully without finding ourselves exploring [the entire history ofword processing](https://medium.com/redletters/evernote-dropbox-paper-and-the-history-of-word­processing-9407b2c7afba) – I’d like to evangelize what very well might be the Ultimate Formatting Languagefor digital text. It’s called [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax), and it’ssomething you’ve likely already used in one form or another. Technically, Markdown is “[a text-to-HTMLconversion tool for web writers](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/),” but – more importantly –it’s a method of stylizing text which is as simple as possible, easy to universalize, and already quite popular.While *Vice* argues that Markdown is a “[power-user tool](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/pa7nbn/slacks-new-rich-text-editor-shows-why-markdown-still-scares­people),” I’d suggest that it’s one everybody should make use of. Though I am currently writing this in Word(for the first time in a good while,) I’m going to [pay for it later](https://slate.com/technology/2012/04/microsoft-word-is-cumbersome-inefficient-and-obsolete-its-time-for­it-to-die.html). 
> A Word file is the story-fax of the early 21st century: cumbersome, inefficient, and a relic of obsoleteassumptions about technology. 
“[[Markdown\] has all the advantages of plain text, but with the organizational power of a word processor](https://lifehacker.com/what-is-markdown-and-why-is-it-better-for-my-to-do-lis-5943320),” says*Lifehacker*. From [Ian Lurie](https://www.portent.com/blog/copywriting/use-markdown-now.htm): 
> I once had to convert a Word document to a web page.> > Once. > > After spending hours deleting mso-style blocks and cleaning up thousands of lines of crap, I swore (andswore, and swore) that I’d never do that again.> > So I moved to [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax). For a writer whopublishes mostly to the web, it’s perfect. 
Before I committed to writing in Markdown and moved *Extratone* to [Write.As](https://write.as/about) – awonderfully simple, open-source web CMS entirely based on Markdown – I really struggled with textformatting on [our old WordPress-based site](http://web.archive.org/web/20190126095147/http:/www.extratone.com/), spending hours cleaning up textfrom Word, Apple Notes, Dropbox Paper, and Google Docs. Now, WordPress [natively supports Markdown](https://wordpress.com/support/can-i-use-markdown-on-wordpress-com/) along with [Ghost](https://ghost.org/faq/using-markdown/), [Slack](https://slack.com/help/articles/202288908-Format-your­messages), [Discord](https://support.discordapp.com/hc/en-us/articles/210298617-Markdown-Text-101­Chat-Formatting-Bold-Italic-Underline-), [Tumblr](https://marco.org/2008/11/14/in-tumblrs-preferences­screen-you-can-specify), and more.<blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">OKAY, YOU GUYS WERE RIGHTABOUT BEAR...<br><br>the whole world was right about Bear...<br><br>I&#39;m not sure if I&#39;veever seen a more beautiful text editor and I&#39;ve seen A LOT. <a href="https://t.co/8SzGiBgoYt">pic.twitter.com/8SzGiBgoYt</a></p>&mdash; David Blue (@NeoYokel) <ahref="https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/1063486573197561857?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 16,2018</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>*Mashable* published [a formidable list](https://mashable.com/2013/06/24/markdown-tools/) of Markdowneditors in 2013, but many are since significantly out of date. Instead, I’d refer you to @awwsmm’s “[State ofMarkdown Editors 2019](https://dev.to/awwsmm/state-of-markdown-editors-2019-2k49),” which suggests[Joplin](https://joplinapp.org/) as the winning pick. Joplin is open-source and syncs across devices usingyour preferred cloud service, but it requires that all notes be written in a monospace typeface, which I do not prefer. If you have a MacOS-running machine and/or an iOS-running smartphone, you *must* downloadand try an application called [Bear](https://bear.app/). It is quite simply the [most beautiful](https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/1063486573197561857) piece of software – aesthetically andfunctionally – that I have ever seen, and therefore the most beautiful possible execution of a MarkdownEditor. From [*The Verge*’s Dieter Bohn](https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/2/14785264/evernote­replacement-bear-app): 
> Bear uses a simple three-paned design. The largest column is devoted to your current note. A smallercolumn to the left contains your notes in reverse-chronological order, topped by a search bar. The left-mostcolumn contains notes that you’ve pinned, as well as any tags you’ve created to organize your notes —#recipes, for example. I spent years trying to sort my notes into notebooks in Evernote, only to learn thatwhat I really needed was a faster search box. 
<div style="padding:56.25% 0 0 0;position:relative;"><iframesrc="https://player.vimeo.com/video/192615466?color=00006b&title=0&byline=0&portrait=0"style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay;fullscreen" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><script src="https://player.vimeo.com/api/player.js"></script> 
As much as I despise the term “seamless,” everything about Bear is its definition. For someone like me, it,alone, almost warrants a reversion to MacOS. If you have the correct platforms, I *require* you to try it.Unfortunately, there can be no true Windows or Linux equivalent without the work Shiny Frog has done tostreamline Bear’s near-instantaneous iCloud integration, but there is one application that can literallysimulate its functionality in every other way. [Typora](https://typora.io/) is an infinitely-customizablealternative that spans all three platforms with a well-populated [themes gallery](https://theme.typora.io/)(including an [actual copy](https://theme.typora.io/theme/cobalt/) of my favorite Bear theme.) Myinstallation is not nearly as *smooth* as Bear, but it’s technically more powerful – bad news for users like mewho can’t resist fiddling. I’ve downloaded (and attempted to author/modify) a billion themes for Typora.Bear, by contrast, allows *just* enough stylistic modification (color theme, a choice list of 7 beautifultypefaces, and sliders for font size, line height, paragraph spacing,) without *any* access to its internalworkings. In this way, it provides the perfect blend of customizability and minimalism. If you tend toward thelatter, try an ultra-slim solution like WordPress’ [Simplenote](https://simplenote.com/). 
![Telegram Desktop](https://i.snap.as/ERQF0xF.png) 
## Telegram 
I ran a poll on both [Twitter](https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/1252322233181261824) and [Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@DavidBlue/104032632147081656) yesterday asking “do you still email things toyourself?” Overwhelmingly, my “audience” responded “yes,” which is awfully surprising considering theirdemographic – young, techish early adopters. Though email is not yet “[obsolete](https://www.inc.com/john-brandon/why-email-will-be-obsolete-by-2020.html)” – as envisioned by *Inc*’sJohn Brandon in 2015 – it has indeed been replaced by other software in many of its functions, *especially*the old Mail-to-Self practice. I cannot remember the last time I emailed myself anything – even to transferphotos from my cellular to my computer, as I used to do often. Instead, I use a private [Telegram channel](https://telegram.org/faq_channels#q-what-39s-a-channel) to send myself photos, videos, links, text, andany other file up to 1.5GB! There’ve always been plenty of reasons to use the messaging app for generalcommunication – especially since [Facebook acquired WhatsApp](https://techcrunch.com/2014/02/24/telegram-saw-8m-downloads-after-whatsapp-got-acquired/) in 2014.Though press coverage of the application has all but dried up, I would argue there are now [more reasonsthan ever](https://medium.com/@sirajea/11-reasons-why-you-should-use-telegram-instead-of-whatsapp­ab0f80fbfa79) to make use of Telegram in your day-to-day life. 
[As of 2016](https://www.wired.co.uk/article/episode-256), Telegram had 100 million active users, but it’scertainly experienced its [fair share of controversies](https://www.abacusnews.com/digital-life/why­telegram-isnt-secure-you-think/article/3014398). I see no reason to be worried about encryption or privacyat all, for that matter, for the vast majority of Mail-to-Self cases. If the files you’re sending yourself aresensitive enough to worry about, you shouldn’t be emailing them, anyway. 
## Other Stuff 
If you’re the sort of person who regularly types out 500+ word text messages (or have to do homework/anyreal writing) on your smartphone, I have a secret to reveal to you: **most smartphones still have Bluetoothkeyboard support**. It may [look strange](https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/1144268334353047552), butyes, you can use a full qwerty keyboard with your phone. Those of us who’ve livestreamed or usedscreenrecording software know that [OBS](https://obsproject.com/) (Open Broadcaster Software) is anabsolute gift from Gourd, but [these days](https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/31/21201043/streamlabs-obs­mac-streaming-twitch-mixer-facebook-youtube), it’s also easy enough for most computer users to make useof. I’d encourage everybody who can think of a reason to record their screen – to show somebody how to dosomething, for instance – to download and install it. Finally, I think every Windows user should look into[compacting their operating system](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows­hardware/manufacture/desktop/compact-os) into just the essentials. “Compact OS” is really just a Windows10 install without [bloatware](https://www.computerworld.com/article/2966113/bloatware-what-it-is-and­how-to-get-rid-of-it.html): the shit you almost certainly don’t need. If you *do* find yourself in need ofdefault Microsoft apps, you’ll be able to redownload them instantly from the Windows Store. 
I’d been meaning to write something like this for a very long time, so I hope you or someone you know hasfound it useful. I’m not an authority in the technical sense, but I’ve used every one of these suggestions inmy own computing life for years, now, to great benefit. If you have anycomments/suggestions/feedback/petty insults, please do contact me via [email](mailto:davidblue@extratone.com), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/NeoYokel), [Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@DavidBlue), or [Discord](http://bit.ly/extratone).

# Preferred Writing Instruments 
![Kaweco Skyline Sport](https://i.snap.as/1hE6Pm3.jpg) 
It’s very pretentious to talk about pens, I agree, but I believe there’s a level of pen pretentiousness which isworth sharing with the writing masses. I continually encounter people in both personal and professionalsettings using - and [often worshipping](https://theoutline.com/post/875/bic-cristal-pen-gold-standard) ­very shitty pens. I'm not going to pretend spending $15 on a pen has not become a novel or ridiculous ideain contemporary culture, but if you're willing, this is one of those areas where some retrospective can lead toreal pleasantnesss. Here are some of the tools I've owned. (I'll be linking heavily to *The Pen Addict* in thispost. It's all we've got. Sorry.) 
![Parker Jotter](https://i.snap.as/r73oOXr.jpg) 
## Parker Jotter 
I believe everyone on Earth should own a [Parker Jotter](http://www.officedepot.com/a/products/9114371/Parker-Jotter-Gel-Pen-Medium-Point/). It's a slim, smallballpoint designed for sketching with a clicking action that just about everyone loves. I have owned and lostmany and I will continue to for the rest of my writing life. I cannot even begin to communicate how worth it$16.99 is to never write with another disposable ballpoint ever again. They're tough, light, and beautiful.Sarah Read for [*The Pen Addict*](https://www.penaddict.com/blog/2017/7/6/parker-jotter-ballpoint-pen­review): 
> If you're primarily a fountain pen user, but you acknowledge the occasional need for a ballpoint, this reallyis the perfect one. It looks and feels like you're spoiling yourself, but the price is low enough that you'll stillhave to add a fountain pen to your cart to get free shipping. 
![Pilot Metropolitan](https://i.snap.as/9JgGeqU.jpg) 
## Pilot Metropolitan 
The [Pilot Metropolitan](https://www.gouletpens.com/collections/pilot-metropolitan-fountain­pens/products/pilot-metropolitan-fountain-pen-silver-dots) has been *the* entry-level fountain pen for all oftime as far as I know. Google for reviews and you'll find praises across the blog spectrum - from [*LittleCoffee Fox*](https://littlecoffeefox.com/pilot-metropolitan-review) to [*Writing For Pain and Pleasure*](https://writingforpainandpleasure.com/2018/04/19/is-there-anything-new-to-say-about-the-pilot­metropolitan) to [*The Gentleman Stationer*](https://www.gentlemanstationer.com/blog/2014/10/31/one­week-with-the-pilot-metropolitan). "I'm not sure there is anything on the market that even approaches a penof this quality for $15.00," says the latter. Testimony from the first: 
> I love how the Pilot Metropolitan feels in my hand. The brass body is cold and weighty while you writewithout becoming a burden to use. Despite its low cost, the look and feel of this pen will be sure to leave animpression on your friends and coworkers. 
[*The Pen Addict* argues for the next pen](https://www.penaddict.com/blog/2013/6/10/pilot-metropolitan­fountain-pen-review) on my list as The Ultimate Beginner, but I'll stick with the Metropolitan. It's a littleunorthodox, actually - it doesn't feel quite as substantial as the other fountain pens I've used in my time, butit's a blast. 
![Lamy Safari](https://i.snap.as/aZ4MbnM.jpg) 
## Lamy Safari 
The modern alternative to the Pilot Metropolitan, the [Lamy Safari](https://www.gouletpens.com/collections/lamy-safari-fountain-pens/products/lamy-safari-fountain-pen-red) 
is the *coolest* instrument on this list to own, but it *is* generally twice the price. Though I liked being*seen* with the Safari more than the Metropolitan, and its writing experience is more conventional in termsof what to expect from other composite fountain pens, I still think the Metropolitan is more fun to use.Instead of reading what I have to say, though, check out the only words about any of these pens I spied in amajor publication. For [*The Strategist*](https://nymag.com/strategist/article/lamy-safari-fountain-pen­review.html), David Notis writes: 
> Fountain pens can be complicated and intimidating, but the Safari was designed to be approachable. (Itwas apparently [originally meant](https://www.penheaven.co.uk/blog/success-story-lamy-safari-fountain­pen/) to help teach proper handwriting to schoolchildren). Pen enthusiasts often recommend it as a great“starter” fountain pen, which I’ve found to be spot-on. [...]> > Not that I’m suddenly an expert, but there *is* something special about writing with a fountain pen. Thesteady flow of ink is so expressive; it somehow makes the weird, messy quirks of my handwriting feelintentional. 
To be honest, I feel like I could've done without my Safari, but I did actually write with it quite extensively.Here are two more opinions: [*The Gentleman Stationer*](https://www.gentlemanstationer.com/blog/2015/2/13/basic-black-one-week-with-the-lamy-safari) and[*Little Coffee Fox*](https://littlecoffeefox.com/lamy-safari-fountain-pen-review). 
![Kaweco Classic Sport](https://i.snap.as/eRzvopT.jpg) 
## Kaweco 
Huge bias here: I adore Kaweco as a company. I first bought a [Mint Skyline Sport](https://www.gouletpens.com/products/kaweco-skyline-sport-fountain-pen-mint) (the featured image of thispost) in 2016 and I fell in love. I love the [breeziness of their colors](https://www.instagram.com/p/BwRA5XnDrGM). I love how Germanic their old logo is and how anything youread about their history is inevitably found on a website looking [like this](http://dirck.delint.ca/beta/?page_id=6610). As Susan M. Pigott points out for *The Pen Addict*, the plastic Sport series can be a bitlacking in refinement. "The Skyline Sport is made of plastic, and it feels rather cheap in the hand," she says.Unfortunately, my [white Classic Sport](https://www.gouletpens.com/products/kaweco-classic-sport­fountain-pen-white) had the same problem, though I also adored it. From [Shashwat Vardhana](https://medium.com/shashwats-pen-reviews/kaweco-classic-sport-review-8005f9e4a478): 
> If you have small to medium sized hands and like the screw cap action, you should most certainly go forthis pen. While it might not be the best writer of its class, its reliability is absolute and I have never had anycomplaints with the pen in this aspect. 
![Kaweco Steel Sport](https://i.snap.as/60EsScw.jpg) 
![Kaweco Steel Sport](https://i.snap.as/JcoAaGu.jpg) 
My baby - my ultimate pen acquisition - was my [Kaweco Steel Sport](https://www.jetpens.com/Kaweco­Steel-Sport-Fountain-Pen-Fine-Nib/pd/20288). I bought it in person with cash at [Pen Place](https://www.penplace.com/products/kaweco-steel-sport-fountain-pen) in Kansas City, and it was by far myfavorite writing instrument of all time. As far as I'm concerned, this is as high as pens get. Find yourself inthe position to buy one and you will be satisfied forever. From [*The Pen Addict*](https://www.penaddict.com/blog/2019/7/29/kaweco-steel-sport-fountain-pen-review): 
> The Steel Sport features a - wait for it - stainless steel barrel. What is it about stainless steel that I love so much in pens? It tends to land in a barrel weight sweet spot that is heavier than aluminum, and lighterthan copper and brass. [...]> > Stainless steel has a density and warmth that I enjoy in a pen barrel. It is also practically indestructible,which is what I want in a pocket pen. 
If you write by hand, you should treat yourself to one of these instruments. If you'd like to write *more* byhand, you **definitely** should. A good pen will have you looking for excuses to write.

# Reading ![COMPAQ 386](https://i.snap.as/niq0aqH.png) 
Since I first began working online in 2016, I have grown and maintained quite a curatorial habit, andtherefore sought all sorts of modern curator's tools. The system I settled upon for some five years: adedicated [Reading List channel](http://bit.ly/extratone) in *Extratone*'s Discord. It wasn't until this pastyear that I encouraged something which (so far) has exceeded willy-nilly copy-and-paste of URLs into asingle feed. It's an application/bookmarking service called [**Raindrop**](https://bit.ly/dbraindrop) whichincludes tagging, public, RSS-enabled collections, and fairy competent web page archiving. I became a paidsubscriber within minutes of discovering its existence, three months ago, and have since integrated it quitehardily in my workflow (including automated reposts in that same Discord channel, for good measure.) Fornow, the arrangement is sortof experimental, but obviously, I'm rooting for [Rustem Mussabekov](https://raindrop.io/about) - sole creator and sentinel of Raindrop.

## Favorite Newsletters 
An ongoing list of my favorite email publications. 
### [Art & Letters Daily](https://aldaily.com/) 
*The Chronicle of Education*'s [ancient](http://web.archive.org/web/19990203021844/http://www.nzine.co.nz/features/ald.html) "web portal" is abit overwhelming, but their [weekly newsletter](https://aldaily.com/subscribe/) has somehow becomeperhaps my most unmissable email subscription. 
### [Platformer](https://www.platformer.news/) 
I have made my tremendous admiration for Casey Newton quite plain over the years. His relentless watch on the social industry is simply superhuman. Recently, he [departed *The Verge*](https://onezero.medium.com/casey-newton-on-leaving-the-verge-for-substack-and-the-future-of-tech­journalism-974a646375fa) - and therefore his seminal daily newsletter, [*The Interface*](https://www.getrevue.co/profile/caseynewton), to have a go at independent publishing via substack. 
### [Nextdraft](https://nextdraft.com/) 
Dave Pell's [*Nextdraft* newsletter](https://nextdraft.com/) is the only hard news mailer I would everrecommend. If you can stand his puns, you need to subscribe. I've recently reduced my actual clicking onhardnews in a big way, so *Nextdraft* has become the singular hard news-ish aggregator I make sure toskim regularly. 
### [Memoir Monday](https://memoirmonday.substack.com/about) 
A weekly collaborative effort between [Catapult](https://catapult.co/), [Longreads](https://longreads.com/),[Granta](https://granta.com/), [Guernica](https://www.guernicamag.com/), [Narratively](https://narratively.com/), and [The Rumpus](https://therumpus.net/) that provides memoirs I *actuallywant to read*, which is astonishing. 
### [Tedium](https://tedium.co/) 
Ernie Smith's *Tedium* is unlike any other publication on the web.

# Recommendations 
![Compaq Portable 386](https://i.snap.as/niq0aqH.png) After writing "[Dirty Dave's Poweruser Tips](https://bilge.world/poweruser-tips-software-shortcuts)," I thought it'd be 
appropriate to have a dedicated, ongoing recommendations page for my favorite/most recommended software. (I also really just wanted to use that incredible featured image.) <iframe sandbox="allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-top-navigation allow-popups allow-forms" scrolling=no 
width="100%" height="185" frameborder="0" align="center" src="https://embed.radiopublic.com/e?if=end-user­WdbezM&ge=s1!c3126cb22fac64802f61b5894d8adef1bec2235d"></iframe> ## Writing ### [Bear](https://bear.app/) Bear is the most beautiful piece of software I've ever seen, both functionally and stylistically. 
### [Typora](https://typora.io/) As an alternative to Bear, Typora is technically much more powerful. Customizable themes and folder selection allow the user to do virtually anything, which may be a downside for some. 
## Social ### [Mastodon](https://joinmastodon.org/) Mastodon may be dominated by the tech-oriented right now, but *you* have the power to change that. Back in 2017, I 
[interviewed its creator, Eugen Rochko for *Extratone*](https://write.as/extratone/mastodon-eugen-rochko-federated­social-network). ### [Periscope](https://www.pscp.tv/) Periscope is one of the best places on the internet, ever. It's generally positive, fascinating, and entirely unique. 
### [Discord](https://discord.com/) Discord is advertised as "chat for gamers," but frankly, I think it's the best way to host an active social community. I built *Extratone* using [our Discord server](https://discord.gg/0b9KQUKP858b0iZF). 
## Email ### [Spark](https://sparkmailapp.com/) "Love your email again" is Spark's logline, and it's a fairly accurate one. The ability to mark three emails as read at a 
time is absolutely invaluable for a smartphone-based mail application. 
# Resurrecting the Compaq Computer Corporation 
![Compaq Logo BANG](https://i.snap.as/6iUt6P6.png) 
## Setting out upon a desperate personal journey to rediscover enchantment with computers. 
This evening, a pack­age is sched­uled to arrive upon my doorstep con­tain­ing a Com­paq Portable Plus lug-­gable com­put­er from 1983 which I have fan­ta­sized about buy­ing for far too many years. Despite liv­ing in themidst of per­haps the worst pos­si­ble finan­cial sit­u­a­tion to spend $139.99 out­right on a rel­ic of com­put­ing, Ifinal­ly *just bought one any­way* last Thurs­day because I’m absolute­ly fed up with life with­out the mag­ic Iremem­ber feel­ing from com­put­ers. Yes, I am hav­ing a mid-life crises and The Machine is just a phys­i­calman­i­fes­ta­tion of one of my favorite sto­ries, but I expect it will pro­vide some­thing irre­place­able for me and atleast one piece of enter­tain­ment for just about any­body: **I’m going to start a pho­to­series of myself usingthe 26-lb., suit­case-like, and utter­ly time-dis­placed Portable Plus in dif­fer­ent cof­fee shops through­out Port-­land**.

There’s also poten­tial oppor­tu­ni­ty (or neces­si­ty) for me to make use of my lim­it­ed knowl­edge of hard­wareelec­tron­ics. I’ve nev­er been very com­fort­able with open­ly using the term “hob­by,” but I ful­ly intend to savor,doc­u­ment, and pre­serve every pos­si­ble detail of my expe­ri­ence, so we’re going to behave as if the tales ofcom­put­er his­to­ry are pre­cious to a ded­i­cat­ed audi­ence besides myself, and that I am there­by and here­afterbind­ing myself to an impor­tant duty of dis­cov­ery, cura­tion, and pre­sen­ta­tion expressed through mul­ti­me­diaof the high­est pos­si­ble cal­iber. 
In oth­er words, **I’m pret­ty sure I’ve just begun a vin­tage com­put­ing blog**. Before we go any fur­ther,then, let’s dis­pense with the oblig­a­tory arrange­ments.

# Why Compaq? 
Put sim­ply, **Com­paq was punk as fuck**. Three dorky Tex­an techn­odads pre­med­i­tat­ed their leave of fair,secure jobs in the indus­try in order to bet every­thing on the promise of a sin­gle unde­ni­ably pro-user ide­al todis­rupt its dom­i­nant monop­o­lis­tic supervil­lian. Unlike any of the count­less oth­er sto­ries from the infor­ma­tionage with the very same intro­duc­tion, theirs was imme­di­ate­ly pro­pelled into stratos­pher­ic, record-break­ingsuc­cess — from cof­fee table sketch­es in the waste­lands of sub­ur­ban Hous­ton nights to *one bil­lion dol­lars*[in less than five years](https://usatoday30.usatoday.com/tech/techinvestor/2001-09-04-compaq­history.htm), prov­ing that it was pos­si­ble to win huge in tech by com­mit­ting sin­cere­ly to lib­er­at­ing the con-­sumer and man­i­fest­ing the ulti­mate per­for­mance of [the under­dog com­plex](https://www.sciencefriday.com/segments/a-david-and-goliath-story-for-personal-computers/) Amer­i­canbusi­ness has ever wit­nessed. 
Those of us who’ve main­tained some curi­ous orbit of tech­nol­o­gy have recent­ly entered a rec­on­cil­la­to­ryprocess as the world has become all at once inti­mate­ly famil­iar with our col­lec­tive pur­suits’ true con­se-­
quences. Nev­er has it been more appro­pri­ate to reflect on the whole­some brava­do of the only Amer­i­cancom­put­er com­pa­ny to build a bil­lion-dol­lar busi­ness atop the sole mantra of user lib­er­a­tion. At a glance onemight assume that AMC’s attempt to repro­duce *Mad Men’s* for­mu­la with a sto­ry set in Compaq’s ori­gin in aseries that’s sup­pos­ed­ly attract­ed a fair num­ber of Net­flix­ers called *Halt and Catch Fire* in con­junc­tion withthe 2016 doc­u­men­tary [*Sil­i­con Cow­boys*](https://www.houstonchronicle.com/entertainment/movies/article/Silicon-Cowboys-captures-shooting-star­that-9227131.php) have suf­fi­cient­ly remind­ed Amer­i­ca of to whom it real­ly owes its priv­i­leged tech indus­try.How­ev­er, a [Twit­ter search](https://twitter.com/search?q="compaq") for “Com­paq” turns up vir­tu­al­ly noth-­ing of con­se­quence, and — on the oth­er cul­tur­al spec­trum — I’ve yet to see a sin­gle well-doc­u­ment­ed col­lec-­tion of Com­paq hard­ware, and I’m unsat­is­fied. 
Like it not, you’re com­ing with me on a safari back through two full nos­tal­gic cycles to redis­cov­er our won­derand excite­ment about tech­nol­o­gy because I miss it des­per­ate­ly and I know you do too. We’re going to findsome­thing mar­velous. 
I believe com­put­ers can be mag­ic again. 
I believe in Com­paq.

# Rod Canion with Brian McCullough 
![Rod Canion Open Talk](https://i.snap.as/4HIp7Mwe.jpg) 
If you've ever found this industry's history intriguing, you've likely heard Brian McCullough's superb _InternetHistory Podcast_ before, and it's obvious to you how invaluable [an interview episode with Compaq's BiggestBoy](http://www.internethistorypodcast.com/2014/05/the-incredible-true-story-behind-amcs-halt-and-catch­fire-how-compaq-cloned-ibm-and-created-an-empire/) would be for a head start on digesting the story. Inaccordance with _Halt and Catch Fire_'s pilot release in 2014, the broad-shouldered soldier of opencomputing appeared to have been on a mini media tour (even though he openly admitted he’d yet toactually watch it.) \[His last remark - “maybe even as exciting as the real thing” - may sound like silly DorkRod conjecture, but the show wasn’t nearly as engaging because they had(?) to remove the _compatibility_component, which is the meat of the whole thing.\] McCullough is usually ace at this stuff, but he sounds abit shaky in this one, though nobody should blame him - I certainly would be, too. Rod Canion's accent(BIOS=_buy-OSS_) and general intensity must make for one hell of a presence, even over the phone. 2014was a long time ago. 
McCullough's own summary of the conversation is so thorough (he was writing a book,) there's only a singlepossible addition. 
> "There's a certain risktaking gene that runs through a lot of Texans." 
There’s no other way to say it: **I believe in Texas**. Specifically, Houston. DJ Screw, UGK, Z-Ro, Trae, FatPat, etc.- these I adopted as religion, years ago. From my perspective, Rod Canion’s ballsy, loyalHoustonianism hustle makes perfect sense. Yes, I’m afraid you’ve basically stumbled into my passionatecause to unite two Houston icons.

# Profound Revelations in iOS 12 
![Siri Shortcuts](https://i.snap.as/ShVoCP3.png) 
## Apple's latest mobile OS update might've seemed mundane, but Siri Shortcuts gives users vastly morepower than Apple customers have ever before experienced. 
Back in 2016, *Pokémon Go*, overclocked Apple Watches, pissing wearables, and What You See is WhatYou Get blogging services all claimed unprecedented casualties among consumers according to*Futureland*'s iOS 10 episode, which we did our absolute best to dramatize in order to survive what wasexpected to be the dullest event on record. We'd only that day been first made aware of Boomerang photosand the mysterious nature of "Live Blogging" as an occupation. [AirPods were introduced](https://www.theverge.com/2016/12/20/14016568/apple-airpods-wireless-earpods-earbuds-review) andsubsequently shit on, and the [comparatively archaic](https://bilge.world/mono-audio-playback) 3.5mmanalog audio jack was confidently parted with, finally. At least I got over "forgetting" about Live Photosbecause it's rapidly becoming difficult to keep stuff *on* the phone now. *I* am coming sincerely close tobelieving none of this is real, anyway. Today, though, it’s a damned straight ballgame, isn’t it? Months havepassed since Apple pushed out its major mobile OS release of the year to [more little rectangular computers](https://www.theverge.com/2016/1/26/10835748/apple-devices-active-1-billion-iphone-ipad-ios) than anyone person could speedcount in a lifetime and YouTube is already recommending me dozens of [videosabout the next one](https://youtu.be/CXKqCWWjxSM). At this point, you and I are already aware of the iOSdevelopment community, who has already been using Internet Operating System 12 on their personaldevices for more than half a year by the time your irises are landing here. Hopefully, all but two or threestranded, dying explorers in the arctic have updated their iPhones and iPads by now, and why wouldn’t they?

Our expectations from this ritual are completely alien compared to those we’d need to anticipate from theevent 5 or 6 releases ago, when one’s phone had to be sent away (in a sense) to latch itself tight to thestability of a desktop-class product in order to undergo a lengthy, destined metamorphosis. Sometimes,backups via 30-pin to USB-2.0 cables took hours, after which the custodian may or may not find theircompanion’s replication had completed successfully. If it had, one had to be sure to close any applicationsapart from iTunes to provide a working environment of utter silence – restarting after finishing the downloadwas my own preferred method – before entrusting the despicably unreliable software to whittle away in asometimes frantically rebooting, feverish procedure with near life-threatening stigma: it wasn’t uncommonfor an update to inexplicably fail, “bricking” the subject iPhone and requiring that one take two whole stepsin the wrong direction and restore it from the entire backup they’d just created (hopefully) in order to…make another, precisely-identical attempt, for lack of variables or alternatives to the process. However, if theuser planned sufficiently and made a point to begin the whole charade immediately upon arriving home forthe evening, these potential frustrations could be compensated for, and odds would favor counting on theirsmartphone to emerge safe and sound from the procedure just before bed, when even those holding thesecond-newest product in the lineage would have just enough screen time to notice that text entry, webpage loading, and window management had noticeably slowed before sighing and tossing their devicetoward the darkness.

These days, one would need to try very hard to be inconvenienced by iOS updates. My iPhone 8 Plus is twoor three times more powerful than my laptop at the moment, and my new friends’ WiFi connection is betterthan what the State government uses internally, back home. I haven’t needed to physically back it up more
than once or twice since I bought it — iCloud stores the lot for $4.99­ a month anyway. I blinked once 
watching *Riki-Oh* with high school friends some time ago and all of the sudden, a 1.6GB download isn’treally a big deal. Siddown and watch your Instagram stories for twenty minutes, and *hey*! You’re ready toupdate! Somehow, I have abruptly found myself in a reality in which **I am the obvious bottleneck** andmy 100 words per minute on a smartphone keyboard, even, is no longer fast enough: my fucking phone isnow **waiting on me** when it updates. The keyholder is the whole goddamned holdup. 
So, what possible purpose could there be in pounding out this “Review” of a free software update that’s inno way optional (waiting a month is no longer a rational minimization of risk — it’s just dumb,) not any moredifficult to attain than the bills currently waiting in your mailbox, nor allowed by the nature of mobileoperating systems to compete with any cross-platform alternatives? For myself, it’s proved [a gratifyingtradition of sorts](http://bilge.world/ios-10-review-speed/) and a good use of my apparently-abundant timeif only for the record's sake (hello, future web archivists, neohuman and otherwise!,) but this release –assuming I haven’t overlooked something – is the most globe-shucking of all because of one singlefeatureset: **Siri Shortcuts**. However, the vast majority of the intra-Apple press' coverage of this releasehas come across nearly as unconcerned with them as I was originally. Take [*Macworld*'s iOS 12 Review](https://www.macworld.co.uk/review/ios-apps/ios-12-3683670/), for instance: it was the first result in myGoogle search for "iOS 12 review," yet Siri Shortcuts are only mentioned in the bottom quarter of its firstpage. When I recorded the "[iOS 12 Review](https://radiopublic.com/end-user-WdbezM/ep/s1!ba096)"episode of my "[podcast](https://anchor.fm/davidblue)," I spoke as if I was somehow the only person on theplanet who comprehends the profound implications of this software addition - which was, of course, more of[an absorbent acquisition](https://techcrunch.com/2017/03/22/apple-has-acquired-workflow-a-powerful­automation-tool-for-ipad-and-iphone/) - but I have since discovered one gem, at least, which has continuedthe conversation in a most superb manner. It's [a technology podcast called *Supercomputer*](https://supercomputer.transistor.fm/about), and it's hosted by [Alex Cox](https://twitter.com/AlexCox) and[Matthew Cassinelli](https://twitter.com/AlexCox) - the latter of whom developed a significant amount of theiOS app [Workflow](https://techcrunch.com/2015/05/16/workflow-hints-at-the-future-of-the-watch-as-a­computing-platform/) (and wrote most or all of its documentation, [apparently](https://anchor.fm/davidblue),) which Apple assimilated as Siri Shortcuts. Both are extremely knowledgeableand competent commentators on - as far as I can hear, at least - virtually **the entire iOS *lifestyle***. (Forthose on the outside who've never stepped in: laugh if you must, but yes it *is* a lifestyle, still, and it's newthought leader [isn't exactly coming up short](https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/3/18124416/tim-cook­apple-infowars-white-supremacy-podcasts-platform-adl) these days.) iOS is technically *software*, yes, butit leaves an intractable itch for some greater, transcendent term. 
<iframe width="auto" height="auto" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pxtA9n2XwAM?controls=0"frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"allowfullscreen></iframe> 
In just forty minutes, without any prior knowledge about this feature, I was able to create a Shortcut whichsends any given handset's IP address and precise GPS location (among other mundane metrics) in a textmessage **to my phone number**. I could share this shortcut among my other submissions to [Sharecuts](https://sharecuts.app/) or [ShortcutsGallery.com](https://shortcutsgallery.com/), where any iOS user coulddownload and subsequently send this information back to *my* phone. (Don't believe me? [Have a go at ityourself](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/2873cc28684646e1904f0e80c21c8481) and I'll send back ascreenshot if you'd like.) I accomplished this without any particular skills or education in softwaredevelopment or cybersecurity - without any real *malice*, even - I was just playing around. As far as myrecollection goes, Apple has *never* included such a powerful, potentially-dangerous piece of software in astandard software update before. It's both absolutely brilliant and sortof a ripoff to be so entrusted for thefirst time. In many ways - like my Disable Bluetooth & WiFi shortcut - Siri Shortcuts represent an awfullyhalf-assed solution to some of the most basic, longtime incongruencies within iOS. Sure, it's great that I canjust make myself a shortcut to completely disable my phone's WiFi and Bluetooth activity with one press orSiri command (combining "type to Siri" with Siri Shortcuts basically enables a form of Command Linefunctionality in iOS,) but frankly, one should've expected the world's largest company to *do it themselves*in perhaps the second of third version of this operating system instead of saying *okay, here are the tools ­you do it!* in its *twelfth*. 
I've found it inevitable when speaking on iOS to avoid discussing the *other* literature available on the subject at any given time. The depth to which technology media has assimilated the habits and mannerismsof a single American company is absolutely mind-boggling, regardless of its history, its market share, or evenits recent trillion-dollar valuation. Dozens of media companies – *[CultofMac](https://www.cultofmac.com/)*,*[MacRumors](https://www.macrumors.com/)*, *[Macworld](https://www.macworld.com/)*, *[9to5 Mac](https://9to5mac.com/)*, [*AppleInsider*](https://appleinsider.com/), *[iMore](https://www.imore.com/)*,and... more – exist solely to cover one single independent company: **Apple, Incorporated**. One wondershow the sum total of the individuals involved with and these organizations compares with the total numberof employees working for the company their careers are (for the moment, at least,) entirely centeredaround. (Further interesting questions: are there any comparable situations anywhere else in Westerncapitalism, and if not - doesn't this sort of attention constitute *some kind* of Monopoly, even if it was notnecessarily an anti-competitive one?) For "reasonable people," the image one conjures up of *The All-The-Time Apple Beat* does not lend to envy, but let's choose to limit ourselves to only the most casual forms ofspeculation. I do not wish to mock them, for I, too remember the sensation of The Apple Drug from anunfortunate time in my childhood development when I was willing to wear a cheap sweatshirt branded witha stupid Mac vs. Windows Users joke unironically to a real live public Junior High school. There are few moreembarrassing admissions, except perhaps admitting that a part of me genuinely yearns to return to this levelof enthusiasm, as misplaced and cringey as it was. It's the addiction to the mystic; it's aspirational in itsdemocratization. *Billionaires* are running the same operating system and much of the same software as Iam every day - even the most followed person on any given platform is still accessing it through the sameinterface I might be. These are incredible truths, but they also reflect a dangerous lack of competition in aproduct category that has become more essential to day-to-day human life than any other in just three orfour blinks of an eye.

*Fuck David Blue*, though. Who are the *real*, *hard-hitting* minds who've kept this industry and thiscompany in check? Well, it's funny you should ask that, because the people's quirky *New York Times* techcritic of late - the esteemed [Farhad Manjoo](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/28/technology/how-to­survive-the-next-era-of-tech-slow-down-and-be-mindful.html) - has just [concluded a five-year-longtechnology column](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/28/technology/how-to-survive-the-next-era-of-tech­slow-down-and-be-mindful.html) with some essential (if perhaps a bit unoriginal) advice: "**just slowdown**." If you're still following along, you shall surely enjoy clicking some of his links, and I would certainlyencourage that you do until you're out of free articles, at least. When Manjoo speaks, Apple listens: hisJanuary decree for Apple to bend with the industry wind and build "[a Less Addictive iPhone](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/17/technology/apple-addiction-iphone.html)" is convincingly propheticconsidering **Screen Time** - probably the most mulled-over iOS 12 addition. As someone who wasdiagnosed with Attention Deficit Disorder (however much or little that may mean to you) just one or twoyears after I began using my/the first iPhone, I've developed a history of what he might call *Addiction* toiPhones in variable oscillation [touching both extremes](https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/1042825995546320896). I carried my first-generation iPhone foralmost 5 years - as you can imagine, it was far from a 100%-functional device toward the end of that bellcurve. In contrast, I've also stood in line at dawn for two iPhone launches, jailbroken, listened to podcasts*only* about apps (far before they were good,) and been compelled to chronicle and reflect upon all of it foras long as I can remember. 
There's no denying that the iPhone has had a profound effect on my life mostly thanks to my own choices,which is why it's worth telling the vast majority of you that features like Screen Time will never help youachieve whatever vague conception of *reduced usage* you may have. If you haven't yet quantified thefigures you'll find within it in mental estimates, you aren't really concerned at all and if you *have*, ScreenTime will only confirm them. Using reminder notifications to optimize your appflow makes no attempt at allto actually escape the mentality of the behavior you seek to lessen from yourself. Another app is still another app; a notification reminding you to stop using an app does nothing but add still more stimuli. If you want tostop using the phone so much, ***stop* using the fucking phone**. If you are truly concerned about howyour handset companion has changed your life, turn it off for a week/month/quarter - however long you*possibly* can. By that, I mean no more or less than what you can manage without gettingfired/dumped/expelled/etc. If you have *truly* reached this point, anything less is probably worth it. There issimply no other way to get a clear picture of how it's changed you. 
Google, Facebook, and the rest of the industry are well aware of this, but know they can't *actually*advocate against the fundamental mechanism that drives their businesses, so they express concern by doingwhat they know: **building more software**. Apple is in a slightly different situation: they still need you tobuy their phones - and even to look at them - but not past the point of hurting yourself emotionally,mentally, or physically because those injuries tend to hurt one *economically*. Screen Time's purpose is tokeep us thriving and buying, but the only effective solve for this can only be communicated in garbagecinema language: **you must find it within yourself**. I am *actually* the worst person from which tomodel your life, except perhaps for my iPhone use: unless there's little else worthy of my attention, myphone is not out. Even if checking my [emails](mailto:davidblue@gmail.com), [Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@DavidBlue), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/neoyokel), etc. are my default tasks,there are infinitely many besides that come first. Every once in a while, it's okay to finish an importantmessage while walking down the street or waiting at a stoplight if things are urgent, but I can guarantee youthat my attention is better consolidated on traveling in 95% of cases - moving with purpose and thenfocusing on my composition *after* I've arrived is almost always more efficient. I realize that I'm cowboyingit here and sound like your Dad, but I'm better with iOS than he is, yet I've never publicly run into anythingwhile looking down at my smartphone in 10 years of hardcore use. **Find somebody who's company makesyou forget about all of this for hours at a time and treasure them**. Also: **stop playing games on yourphone**. *What the hell are you doing*? Read a blog! Explore the wonders of the open web! Your peers,your battery, and your elderly future self with thank you for it. (One exception is playing word/trivia gameswith your partner. That's very cute and good for you.) 
*I was elated to see that even Apple supports my [age-old cause for Twitter Lists](https://twitter.com/i/moments/996616971880882176). Also, the new function in Apple Music allowing theuser to search by lyrics [appears to work very well](https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/1042825995546320896)...* 
To get back to specifics, the **new Photos application** is now basically what it should have been all along,[3D Touch has been virtually eclipsed](https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/9/24/17896228/ios­12-keyboard-trackpad-cursor-3d-touch-iphone-ipad) for those strange bastards among you who never likedit, and the release's most democratically-redeemable feature is **optimization**, which even on my iPhone8 Plus was blatantly noticeable and very welcome. However, probably the best insight to come out of mylong, rambly *End User* review was the revelation that basically any other human activity is a better use oftime than [applauding Apple](https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/17/17862236/ios-12-review-download­features-update-speed-iphone-ipad-screen-time-notifications-siri) for learning to hold new features off untilthey've been thoroughly tested and focusing instead on smoothing existing software. In fact, I'd argue thereis absolutely no reason for someone like me to say anything even remotely positive about the world'swealthiest company ever again, though that doesn't apply to *The Verge* or Chaim Gartenberg, who'sreview - for the record - was much more useful to 9999 times more people than anything I'll ever write.However, isn't it sortof unreasonable to expect anything but *absolute perfection* from Apple at this trillion-dollar juncture? A handful of varying interpretations of absolute perfection per product category, even. 
With gorgeous, iCloud-enabled premium apps like [Bear](https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/1063486573197561857) in the picture, integrating wholly into theApple environment has maintained its relative rank above the alternatives to its specific minimal-esqueutilitarian *niceness* which appeals so strongly to *those people* among both consumer and professionalbuyers. Readers from within this culture recognized a short time ago that [iOS is in the process of replacingMacOS](https://www.wired.co.uk/article/ipad-pro-2018-review) as the star component of this environmentacross the board, though there's at least a moderate journey ahead before it truly reaches this achievementfor the median user. For myself, iOS 12 improved the experience of using my 8 Plus and certainly gave mesomething intriguing to play with in Siri Shortcuts. For the rest of the world's billions of daily iOS users, I say 
*be as insatiable as possible* - always expect more. #software

# ‘Solo: A Star Wars Story’ Is Dumb Luck Wrapped in Toxic Themes 
![Hands Sorrow](https://i.snap.as/6UghZsm.jpeg) 
## The repugnant missteps of ‘Star Wars’ in the hands of Ron Howard and the long-awaited conclusionsabout the nature of cinema’s luckiest character to which they lead. 
It's opening night at the Bagdad Theater on Hawthorne in Southeast Portland and hardly anybody’s botheredto show up. Less than 20% of the venue’s 500 seats are occupied by the time the host takes the stage tointroduce *Solo*, but those who *are* here for the last Thursday showing have been shouting, whooping,and gurgling bad approximations of wookiee noises since the screen cut to black from its ad slideshow. If mymiddle row can be assumed an accurate sample, only a handful of these are “fans” enough to feel compelledto wear a *Star Wars* t-shirt. As I grab my last cocktail, the bartender tells me that only 300 folks showedup for the evening matinee, though he himself was “excited” to see the movie — one of a minority amongPortlanders, apparently, who still give a shit about *Star Wars.* 
By design, *Solo: A Star Wars Story* is a *slightly* more complex film than The Episodes in the same way*Rogue One* was, if a bit better executed, narratively. First, please rest assured that Alden Ehrenreichassumes the Han Solo persona as truly as anyone could — he triumphed through a [ridiculously extensivecasting process](https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/tv/2016/10/05/phil-lord-chris-miller-fox-son-of-zorn­last-man-earth-making-history/90722222/), and is certainly handsome enough (if not more conventionally sothan his predecessor) to consistently look the part. He actually bears an unsettling resemblance in featuresand mannerisms to one of the nicest guys I’ve ever met and that through-and-through boyishnessparticularly makes sense here, set in Han’s formative, earnest youth — the stated purpose of the film’sexistence. Franchise fanatics, then, should be content. (It’s a good thing CGI-ing the main character in a liveaction film isn’t quite a low-risk option yet.) And yes, Donald Glover completely *steals* the vain, infinitelystylish Lando Calrissian and inevitably makes one wish to [see him cast again](https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2018/05/lando-calrissian-movie-donald-glover). Personally, I am verytired of seeing Woody Harrelson, though all the [components of his public persona](https://www.theguardian.com/global/2018/jan/07/woody-harrelson-i-used-to-have-my-head-up-my-ass-)should all but ensure his likability. From [what I saw in *Three Billboards*](http://extratone.com/three­billboards-outside-ebbing-missouri-review), I’d concede that he is as talented of an actor as I am capable ofappreciating, but his role as Tobias Beckett in *Solo* couldn’t possibly be substantial enough to actuallymake use of his craft. 
Though I don’t believe in “spoilers,” or use of the term to bait readers, it’s worth stating for the record whateveryone should know by now: **there simply aren’t spoilers in a Star Wars movie** — every human beingon Earth knows too much about the formula to ever have any of these films’ comparatively irrelevant plots“ruined.” The most surprising, historically-significant decision of this whole production was the [omission](http://screencrush.com/does-solo-have-an-opening-crawl/) of the traditional yellow type opening crawl overa backdrop of distant stars, which I genuinely found myself missing. (Apparently it wasn’t present in *RogueOne*, either — I just failed to catch it.) I was very pleased to see my own number one favorite device of thefranchise used within this film’s first ten minutes: crimelords and gang leaders as hugely magnified variationsof the creeping and crawling creatures our instincts are planned to abhor. *Solo*’s first villain — the gigantic,wormlike boss Lady Proxima (Linda Hunt) — is completely inconsequential, and only appears in a singlescene, but the practice of grossly oversized monstrosities leaving absolutely nothing of a baddie’s essence tobe extrapolated by the audience from nuance is one of very few ways these films are let loose, and it openlyshits on the more pretentious viewer’s assumptions about good writing, which I think big money moviesshould feel more comfortable doing, generally. 
This first act begins on Han’s home planet Corellia — the bleaker urban, industrial, working-class counterpartto the clean capitol cityworld Coruscant — with his rather predictable mission to escape Lady Proxima’ssphere of control with his girl, Qi-ra (Emilia Clarke,) who could and should have been more creatively named,given her importance not as her own character with depth to develop (a no-no for a female role, Gourd helpus,) but as Han’s mirror image to grow darkly apart, proving that he — *The Good Guy* — is unquestionablymore morally fortified than anyone else in the whole goddamned universe. After having been drug through so very many, I couldn’t tell you at this point how to make the introductory escape action of this sort ofproduction more exciting and less formulaic. Big surprise — their plan goes awry, and Qi-ra is preventedfrom leaving the planet with Han, who’s immediate (and I mean *immediate*)solution is his enlistment inthe Imperial Navy via the recruiting station right there in the damned spaceport (during which the film takesthe liberty of seizing his surname’s explanation) to serve the English in their grand conquest of the universe.Bizarrely, he manages to serve as a grunt for *three whole years* of complicity in unmentioned atrocitiesuntil he encounters the disguised criminal Wise Old Woody in the middle of pulling a job with his two-personcrew. The team doesn’t agree to bring Solo along until he meets an asset in Chewbacca for the first time ashe briefly inhabits another of the classic *Star Wars* trap: *the hungry monster in a shadow-filled mud pit*,but is spared the wrath because of his introductory grasp on Chewie’s shrieking language (called[Shyriiwook](https://web.archive.org/web/20061201002846/http://www.starwars.com/databank/character/chewbacca/))in which he manages to sufficiently pitch the advantages of his survival, and the two escape, chainedtogether. Observing the addition of Wookiee to the deal, the crew briefly debates the prospect’s new value inproviding “needed muscle,” which convinces Woody to return for them and kicks off a series of case studiesin this film’s bizarre attitude toward the commodification of the oppressed. 
However, in a rare depiction of his volition, Chewbacca *is* briefly consulted before the two seek to beformally included on the job, and is even asked around a campfire, later, what he’s shooting for in life at themoment, to which he responds “finding my family/tribe.” Despite having spent a whole three hellish years inthe trenches with the British, the romantic Han Solo declares his primary motivation for all of it still lies in hisdesire to return to Corellia and rescue Qi’ra. In their stolen Imperial ship, the lot descend on a snowymountain-traversing Maglev to steal the Uranium it’s transporting in a scene that’s straight up jacked fromanimated family classic *The Polar Express*, but… *oh no!…* A gaggle of “marauders” called the *CloudRiders* (yet another throwaway proper noun) roll up on [those speeder bikes from Endor](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/74-Z_speeder_bike) (except these can fly,) and screw up everything *so*badly that both of Woody’s crew end up dead and the booty scuttled. After the fact, Woody reveals to Hanthat the job was contracted by yet *another* carelessly-named crime syndicate — *Crimson Dawn*, andthat his only possible course of action is now vigorous brown nosing to its leader, Dryden Vos (Paul Bettany)((aka Scarred Jarvis,)) in the waning hope he’ll spare his life to make another attempt. Following thisinformation, he firmly suggests that Han and Chewie fuck off, lest their faces become known in theunderworld, dooming them to serving it forever, apparently. Already, this vague presumption of Han’s puritywhich all of the protagonists must constantly venerate in martyrdom is getting tiresome, as is the dynamic ofhis insistence against them. 
Naturally, both Chewie and Han end up along for a visit to Scarred Jarvis’ tower yacht, where the latter*very* conveniently stumbles upon none other than his long lost love, Qi-ra in the bar. Despite having spentthe past three years at war in unspeakable conditions thinking only of how to liberate and be reunited withher, he isn’t bothered to express more than the moderately-excited and surprised hug you’d expect ofsomeone who’s just run into the kid down the cul-de-sac from their childhood home who used to ride herbike over for popsicles on Sunday afternoons. While he does rehearse for her the tale of their reunificationas his one motivation for everything since they were separated — including his presence there, “right now,”he follows the profession up quite abruptly with the sly suggestion that they fuck as soon as possible. Trueto trope, she is jaded and indefinite as she distantly implies her binds of servitude while flashing the tattoo ofthe extremely-forgettable and innocuous Crimson Dawn logo on her right wrist. (The total lameness of thebrands in this movie *must* be intentional. I can think of no other explanation.) 
The evil Scarred Jarvis is then introduced, quickly stealing the crown for Best Host of all *Star WarsA*ntagonists before politely asking Woody why he shouldn’t kill the lot of them. As per his infinite luck, Hanpulls the idea of stealing *unrefined* Uranium out of his ass, which has somehow never occurred to anyoneelse in the room, despite their unanimous top-of-the-head knowledge of the single location where it ismined. Shortly, the merry three plus Qi-ra conveniently in tow are off to a casino-esque establishment to findLando, who Qi-ra describes as “attractive, stylish, charming,” and like adjectives, to Han’s obvious sexualchagrin, which is furthered by his subsequent loss of a card game with Lando’s ship — the *MillenniumFalcon*, of course — in the stakes. Of course, the attractive, beautifully-dressed black man only bests Solo
— the earnest, simpleton, *Good Guy* white dude who wears the same outfit for decades — in front of Qi­ra, the female prize by way of sleight-of-hand, the film shamelessly playing on that strange insecurity white guys have about their partners’ secretly everpresent and very powerful temptation to dump them withoutwarning for black cock. Further emasculation is inflicted on poor little Han when Lando turns his *oh-so­crafty* (actually just very charismatic) charm upon Qi-ra, who reveals that *she’s* the boss of the gig. Thefinal blow to Han’s dickitude is cast when he tries to enter the negotiation between the two and Landochides “the adults are speaking,” but eventually agrees to provide them a lift for a 25% cut, so the lot makepreparations to leave. 
Enter my new favorite character of the franchise, Lando Calrissian’s co-pilot, L3–37 (voiced by PhoebeWaller-Bridge,) or “L3,” the proudly sentient, violently revolutionary pro-rights droid who is introduced as sheis pleading with two fighting droids in a square cage surrounded by screaming spectators (easy does it onthat thematic slavery) to circumvent their “fighting programs” because they “don’t have to do this.” ThoughLando and the crew behave like her duress is foolish and unimportant — pulling her away to the *Falcon —*she is allowed another opportunity to free droids very soon, but not before *Solo*’s single short privateconversation between two female characters. 
On the way to Kessel, Qi-ra stops by the cockpit and converses with L3. Until recently, I was unaware ofwhat’s largely regarded as the worst habit of male writers with female characters: **if and when they have aone-on-one conversation between another female character, it’s only about other male characters**. Sureenough, L3 begins by insisting to Qi-ra that Han is in love with her, insisting by the objective findings of hersensors — which Qi-ra uncharacteristically denies like a bashful little girl before L3 continues on aboutLando’s longtime love for *her*, and why it must remain unrequited, which we are encouraged to laugh atby the doubt Qi-ra voices without much hesitation regarding the hypothetical union’s sexual mechanicsbecause it’s so *preposterous.*(I’ll get back to that in a moment.) 
When the team arrives on Kessel and infiltrates the mine, L3 creates a “distraction” when she beginsremoving the restraining bolts from droids in the control room, calling the practice *savage*, or*uncivilized*, or maybe *barbarian —* I don’t quite remember. As she frees them without any noticeabledetraction from her duties as Seth Green of the heist — hacking controls, remotely opening doors, and allthat — the droids begin to help free others in an exponentially multiplying circle of liberation until theybecome a rowdy mob who’s *cute* acts of rebellion are spaced throughout a few minutes of screentime inshort jumpcuts off the other crew as they fight deeper into the mine. With the most significant emphasisever placed upon Chewbacca in *Star Wars* history, he halts when he spies slave Wookiees struggling tofind off enforcers and informs Han that he’s going to break off and assist them. Since Chewie’s only allowedto speak to the audience through Han’s retorts and never directly, it’s impossible to know how he phrased it,exactly, but from my perspective, his appeared to be the expression of a wish to do what Han had to*agree* to release him to do, as would a master, not a “partner.” Of course, Solo *does* agree, albeithesitantly, because he’s *The Good Guy*, while quite inconsiderately expressing his desire to see Chewieagain soon instead of wishing him success. However, releasing him to free his people (as per his primary lifegoal, expressed before,) means that Han has to load *twelve* of the *super heavy* unrefined Uraniumtubes onto the cart *all by himself* and push it fully loaded at least *50 whole yards* without the assistanceof his big strong slave. Boy, *what a pain in the ass!* He’s spared his laboring, though, when Chewbaccareturns after no time at all with the enslaved Wookiees he’s just heroically rescued, who he then*immediately asks to assist his master* in pushing the cart — performing the *same labor* they were forcedto do under the enslavement they were supposedly liberated from, seconds before. 
The heist has inadvertently (nice, huge emphasis on *inadvertently*) ignited a slave rebellion throughout themine, which serves the crew only as a distraction for the guards. The chaos is interrupted a half dozen timesor so by those jumpcuts back to the control room of *adorable little droids* enacting their pitifully amusingrevenge on the equipment — slapping a keyboard with a cookie sheet-like pan, stomping on a control panel,etc. — while L3 shouts parodical quasi-Marxist battlecries, which… yes… include referring to the freed droidsas “comrades.” She even radios Lando at one point and triumphantly proclaims that she’s “found her truecalling.” 
> If and when a female character has a one-on-one conversation with another female character, it’s onlyabout other male characters. 
By the time the Uranium cart is within its last few yards of the awaiting *Falcon*, the riot has reached the 
landing bay and the guards around its perimeter have readjusted their priorities to disabling the ship’slanding gear. This interrupts Lando in the cockpit, who has chosen this time to work on dictating hisautobiography because he’s a man who bothers to dresses himself well and is therefore oh so *maniacally,comically*, and *unreasonably* vain! How berserk! Still looking good as hell, he emerges and stands on theramp to cover the rest of the crew’s return and loading of the dangerous Uranium with blaster fire, shoutingthe obligatory intermittent “come on, hurry up,” until L3 appears, also firing a blaster and shouting until shearrives in front of Lando, before noticing some commotion(?) with droids behind her and turning around,again fervently shouting more liberation cries. Lando doesn’t budge from the *Falcon*’s side, but yells afterher, until he watches as she is shot repeatedly and falls, prompting him to run to her side. Filmedunnecessarily gruesomely, her head and shoulders separate from what’s left of her lower body when he firsttries to hoist her up. Of course, his recklessness gets him shot in the arm, so Chewie returns to carry themboth to the safety of the ship, where the injured Lando holds her head lovingly in his arms for her lastmoments, repeating “I can fix you, I can fix you.” 
Now, I understand that *Star Wars* movies (or their reviews, for that matter) are not the sort ofentertainment one seeks out in order to examine the dynamics of power structures or elaborate culturalsymbolism, but they all contain a significant amount of both. The sterile, cold, and bureaucratic GalacticEmpire is the British Empire, the Rebellion and the Republic are the United States or its colonial precursors,the Jedi are vaguely Native American, and the Death Star is the Boston Tea Party. You’ve recognized this,I’m sure because it’s shoved in your ears most explicitly by their accents, and less so in your face byaesthetic influences, tactical philosophies, command etiquette, and posture, even. *Solo*’s main character issoaking in American Old Westness, which may or may not have led to its liberal saturation with the themesof individual rights, slavery, and liberation. Regardless, they’re certainly present, and most of themdisturbingly for comedic effect. 
As a silent character to the audience, it’s understandable that Chewbacca had too many limitations to occupya strong second to Han Solo’s lead in the narrative’s eye, and perhaps the relationship between the two asportrayed in the previous films reeked so strongly of servitude that it was an inevitable element when thetime came to write them their very own movie. In direct contrast to the firm place of all droids in the social
hierarchy of the last 9 movies — addressing humans as “Master,” unapologetically spoken of as property, andtraded and/or gifted as such by both protagonists and antagonists, etc. — what we see of Lando and L3
together is a genuinely and complexly affectionate partnership between equals, which *Solo* makes aneffort to emphasize, if only to laugh at. 
In response to the forced violence between two drones for spectator sport, L3 is completely enraged, andshe cries (among other things) “we are sentient!,” but her distress is trivialized as hysterical distraction (see:*Django Unchained*.) When she suggests to Qi-ra that Lando (who is already illegitimized as a cheatingnarcissist, and therefore effeminate) is attracted to her, it’s a joke (which many in my audience laughed at)at the expense of her trivialized sexuality. After she triumphs and declares the liberation of her kind to be hertrue cause, she is immediately destroyed fighting for its sake, yet her ideology is not once acknowledged byher fleshy companions, and her body is quickly gutted for the data on her “central processing unit” as it’sinterfaced with the *Falcon*. Granted, Lando *does* thoughtfully muse “she’s part of the ship now” shortlyafterward, which would be nice, if you’d forgotten his last words were an outright lie. Lastly, it’s worth notinghow apathetic the main characters themselves are toward the Kessel miners, especially as they are packingup to leave, when the camera pans over the chaotic struggle between the liberated and their guards in veryclose proximity to the awaiting *Falcon*, yet there was not a suggestion that they would even *consider*letting them take refuge from the violence in their very spacious freighter. Aside from Han’s or Qi-ra’s,**Solo treats liberation as charming or amusing, nothing more**. 
Anyway, the crown jewel of *Solo* for many fans will probably be the scene of the infamous Kessel Run,when Han Solo and Chewbacca first take the helm(?) of the *Millennium Falcon* with Lando injured and L3dissected, using her “navigational database” to plot a very risky shortcut around the scary space cloud by thescary space squid and the scary space hole in order to make it to the site of the refinery before the volatileUranium explodes. Once there, *darn old flakey Lando* fucks the hell of in the *Falcon* right as the CloudRiders roll up, but *whoa!* their leader is actually a very young woman with freckles! She describes theatrocities of Crimson Dawn and suggests that Han (who’s now the established decisionmaker for whateverreason) give *them* the Uranium in order to establish “the beginning of a rebellion,” which we can safely assume is *The* Rebellion, which does beg one to wonder why Solo never once bragged among the later
rebellion about having started the whole thing in the other films, considering that — *whaddya know* — he
says yes! 
Woody, however, says he’s going to retire upon the news of this decision before immediately reappearingagain on Scarred Jarvis’ yacht after he’s revealed to have betrayed the Uranium ruse to him. Qi-ra ends upkilling Scarred Jarvis, saving Han, but after promising to follow him and escape, she rings up the late Scarred
Jarvis’ boss — a Sith Zabrak who, I would argue, is *not necessarily* Darth Maul, though he probably is — and
informs him that her boss is dead and she’s assumed his post. As Han and Woody meet again in an Old Weststandoff (complete with sand,) the latter insists *one more time* that Qi-ra is not who Han thinks she is (asJarvis and Qi-ra herself have also said repeatedly,) describing her as “a survivor,” before Han kills him inself-defense. 
Finally, after seeing the Cloud Riders off with the Uranium, Han finds Lando once again in a card game — this
time taking care to disable his sleight-of-hand device beforehand so that he wins the *Millennium Falcon*,“fair and square,” and we cut to Solo (who seems remarkably upbeat considering the recent betrayal of thelover he’d longed years to reunite with) and Chewie in her cockpit as they tie in that one last knot bydeclaring their destination, Tatooine, before roaring off into hyperspace, leaving the credit roll in their wake. 
> Solo treats liberation as charming or amusing, nothing more. 
Over two years ago, I concluded [my first work for *Extratone*](http://bit.ly/wigglecruise) about *The ForceAwakens* by arguing that *Star Wars* on the big screen should be allowed to die in favor of investing thetime, energy, and funding they require in the pursuit of something new, but the industry still appears tobelieve that nostalgia is a surer bet where profits are concerned, at least, even after two whole decades ofmind-numbing reanimated properties. I didn’t catch *The Last Jedi* until recently, which was remarkablywell-done measured against the others as a *Star Wars* movie, but certainly didn’t aim to achieve muchmore. Clearly, there must be some truth in Hollywood’s cowardice about original properties- especially whenit comes to the sort of fantasy armed with potent but unguided emotional bombs that define the *StarWars* universe, so it wouldn’t make much sense to revive my old diatribe, here. (Though I can assure youthat I will be relentless if this horseshit continues for much longer.) *The Force Awakens* and *The LastJedi*, though, were episodic titles for the family, and these spinoffs that began with *Rogue One* aresupposed to be for… well, I’m not entirely sure. In reality, they’ve only moved the proverbial bar up a verywee bit to the family who occasionally says “shit,” because they’re not intellectually stimulating enough tojustify themselves as Big Boy-only productions. Or, they wouldn’t be, were they not part of this franchise. 
The truth is, the fans have grown up, and they… *I*… will still buy a ticket for the smallest crumb of hopethat a product of this huge machine will be capable of making us feel even a fraction of what we felt aschildren watching the original films. For me, *The Force Awakens* actually did, once, in that blast of hornsbefore the opening crawl, but it hasn’t happened since, and I should certainly stop expecting or wanting toexpect that it will. For others, it’s still working. Though there was a fraction of who I expected to be inattendance with me, they did laugh at a handful of (mostly fascist) moments, and whooped, hollered, andeven clapped for a few seconds at the end. I’m surprised opening night wasn’t packed because Portland isthe single most nostalgia-addicted culture I’ve ever seen anywhere in the United States. Then again, there*are* a billion theaters here, so perhaps the sample is just lousy. We’ll see how tomorrow and Sunday go,but I’d be surprised if any boxoffice records were broken. 
In the past, when film enthusiasts andfans have described Han Solo as “the best character in *Star Wars*,”they’ve actually been praising his *potential* as a character, not his material itself, and *Solo*’s most
effective function as a franchise film was to shut that praise down. Han was not at all denied his movie —*this* is *his* movie — and it provided him the screentime to show us who he truly is and why we *really*
like him so much: **he doesn’t fucking change**. The secret to Han Solo’s moral and emotional resiliency isnothing more than halted development. The same old inner conflict between the tough, ruthlessly self-interested persona he does his best to project for everyone around him and the consistent reality of his softinsides was presented in his first scene way back in 1977, and we’re now sure that he was unable to make*any* progress toward its resolution despite openly and obviously brooding over it for an entire lifetime:from at least as early as his young adulthood in this film until his death at the hands of his little Sith son. 
*There is 0 variation*. He *always* comes back for the cause at the crucial moment after declaring himselfthrough with it. Without fail, he’ll sacrifice the entirety of any self-making enterprise for just about anyunderdog with a problem who crosses his path. (Which probably explains his constantly-fleeting success as asmuggler well into gray hair and jowls.) *Solo* is abundantly clear about Han’s true nature and very willingto expose how uninteresting it is. When he first proclaims to Qi-ra that he’s become “an outlaw,” she shutshim down with the film’s ultimate quote, insisting that she “knows who [he] *really* is: *the good guy.*” 
If the video game-despising fans will bear with me for a moment, it’s worth noting that Bioware’s *StarWars: The Old Republic* MMORPG is the most interesting and extensive source of nuanced narrative in theIP (it holds the world record for the largest voiceover project ever produced,) and most of it can now be
experienced without actually playing the game. Like *Solo*, it’s set pre-saga, but considerably before — a few
centuries, if I remember correctly, which gave the writers a gigantic opportunity to both expand andpredestine the universe. There are eight different class stories with around 50 cumulative hours of dialog,each. A few are relatively unimaginative, but the majority are complex, exciting, emotionally-involved talesthat create very rich characters, and all of them can be streamed in their entirety on YouTube. If you arewilling to see the potential of a Han Solo-like character fulfilled in a different medium, the [Smuggler classstory](http://bit.ly/torsmuggler) is a pretty damned engaging exploration of the *kind outlaw with conflictedidentity issues* angle. 
From my perspective, *Solo*’s frequent less-than-subtle maltreatment of some very brutal and sensitivepower relationships makes it the most toxic of the *Star Wars* films yet, and I assume it ended up that way,unnecessarily because Ron Howard is an all-American son of a bitch. If these titles are going to continue tobe passed around between bigwhig directors, future unpleasantries are inevitable. Notably, I’ve yet to seeany mention of these disturbing themes from the respectable authorities of the film criticism establishment,who’ve been overwhelmingly [charmed](https://www.newyorker.com/culture/richard-brody/wookiee-nights­solo-a-star-wars-story-reviewed) by *Solo*’s nostalgia. Take from that whatever you will. 
If we continue to love the character Han Solo, it’ll be in the same way we love our earnest, foolish,emotionally-stunted manchild fathers who’s developmental inadequacies are often embarrassing, sometimesabusive, and thoroughly pitiful. *Solo* leaves no more room for an idealized, elegant perception of this
character — he’s no more than a *pretty good guy* with a lifelong addiction to thrill-seeking and a shitload of
luck. 
To declare unequivocally whether or not *Solo: A Star Wars Story* is worth a trip the cinema with your date,your children, or just your own damned conscience would require me to disregard a whole host ofcomplicating factors, but if you’ve stuck it this far with me, you’d have a lot to disregard yourself to jump in.I’d advise that parents watch it themselves before deciding whether or not it’s something worth adding toyour child’s life. Of those of you like me who’ll tow the line despite what you know and watch a *Star Wars*film alone on opening night in delirium hoping for just a drop from the Fountain of Youth, I would ask: howlong are we really going to keep kidding ourselves?

# Star Trek: Fuck 
![Star Trek Discovery](https://i.snap.as/pshqmlW.jpg) 
## Discovery is pushing boundaries, but for what purpose? 
*Discovery* may no longer be new - not even the newest *Star Trek* property - but it *is* new to me.According to the [alternate timeline exemption](https://web.archive.org/web/20091227080806/http:/www.mtv.com/movies/news/articles/1611063/20090511/story.jhtml) of the J.J. movies, I've been left without "Canon" *Star Trek* television since 2005 (or 2155)with the last episode of *Enterprise*, but I've been looking forward with moderate anticipation to anopportunity to watch this new entry into "[the stodgiest and squarest of all sci-fi universes](https://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/in-star-trek-discovery-the-future-is-a-simpler-time)."Though I am extremely well-versed in Gene Roddenberry's baby, I come to both you and *Discovery* withabsolutely zero desire to analyze whether or not it is "Trek" enough, "good" science-fiction, or even "good"television - I'd like only to land on your screen between all of these institutions and their proctors in someunique insight from all of them, without the clichés, cringey jokes, or unnecessary *Trek*ism. What I willstrive to do is perform [my Special Duty](https://extratone.com/solo-star-wars-film-review) in relation toAmerican intellectual property mastodons for which I have my own adoration: to determine whether or not[they should die](https://extratone.com/star-wars-the-force-awakens-review). I know absolutely *nothing*about television writing – the same amount I know [about film](https://extratone.com/tag:film) – so I hope Ican provide something usefully unique. 
I would rather *Star Trek* **not** have to die, but I wouldn’t be surprised if it’s necessary. Withoutsounding like I have to prove myself, know that the property – in particular the history of *Star TrekOnline*’s development – was a very important part of my adolescent life. I have watched every episode ofevery series several times at least, but I know better than to entrust my entire emotional existence into thepromise of a continuation like *Discovery*. It most fascinates me how revivals of old names like this goabout contextualizing their dialogue and other elements for today’s audience. “[Snug as a bug in a rug](https://subslikescript.com/series/Star_Trek_Discovery-5171438/season-1/episode-3-Context_is_for_Kings)”is surely not an expression we should expect to survive the next 250 years of human development, and yetthis is supposed to be an aspirational series? It even made it in the recap! I should confess now: it is actually*Star Trek Online* which made me curious enough to seek out a CBS All Access Free Trial. The marketingworked very well. 
![The Measure of Morality](https://i.snap.as/4Wgb1i1.png) 
I tend to install the game for a few weeks or so around this time every year just to check in. This time, I wasgreeted by [*Star Trek Online: Legacy*](https://www.pcgamer.com/star-trek-onlines-legacy-update-lets­you-live-your-star-trek-picard-dreams/) – a new expansion featuring *Voyager*’s Jeri Ryan and*Discovery*’s Sonequa Martin-Green reprising their respective characters in voiceover roles. I figured outthat Michael Burnham must have been from The New Show fairly quickly, but I was disappointed to find outthat the character was not in fact a trans man, but rather a female character with an unusually male name.For the most part, Burnham is simply an outlier in *The Measure of Morality* Parts [I](https://sto.gamepedia.com/Mission:_The_Measure_of_Morality_(Part_1)) and [II](https://sto.gamepedia.com/Mission:_The_Measure_of_Morality_(Part_2)). She accompanies one’s character(along with Seven of Nine) to several different battlegrounds and stories we’d already seen before inprevious episodes – *when the budget’s running low, reuse sets*, but there is one instance where *we* arebrought into *her* (*Discovery*’s) world, which feels disorienting. The whole experience plays like it wasforced upon STO by CBS in order to squeeze as many viewers into our free CBS All Access trials with as littledevelopmental investment into the game as possible. Well, here I am! 
In Season 1, Episode 4 of *Discovery*, the writers made a [very foul mistake](https://www.geekwire.com/2017/star-trek-discovery-elon-musk/)… They placed fucking Elon Musk’s namealongside the aviation pioneering Wright Brothers and the fictional inventor of warp drive, Zefram Cochrane. 
> How do you want to be remembered in history? Alongside the Wright Brothers, Elon Musk, ZeframCochrane? Or as a failed fungus expert? 
I can’t be timid about this – it straight up makes me *ill*. I can *guarantee* you that Orville and WilburWright would have *never* watched fucking *South Park* and that I am actually going to be sick right hereon this couch. 
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I&#39;m sorry, I don&#39;tlook up to anyone who watches South Park. it&#39;s just a personal rule, okay?</p>&mdash; David Blue(@NeoYokel) <a href="https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/1255564278247063555?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 29, 2020</a></blockquote> <script asyncsrc="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script> 
I’ll spare you further ranting, but… Jesus Christ. I will not believe that I live in a world where this sort ofcomparison is acceptable. I’m not going to freak out because they say “shit” and “fuck” now, though I dowonder what Gene Roddenberry (though he [wasn’t all that great](https://www.nationalreview.com/2016/09/star-trek-gene-roddenberry-was-misogynistic-hack/), it turns out)would say – something like “[profanity is no longer a necessary part of 23rd century language](https://youtu.be/x6-UAditg7Y).” I thought [Morgan Jeffery’s take](https://www.digitalspy.com/tv/ustv/a840967/star-trek-discovery-episode-5-fuck-swearing/) on this for*Digital Spy* was an interesting one: 
> There's an argument to be made that the old style of Trek might feel naive in 2017. But there's anotherthat it'd be a refreshing antidote to the times, the Trek we really need right now as opposed to the one wedeserve. 
I like to watch fellow *Star Trek* enthusiasts squirm and cry “continuity” and “[canon](https://slate.com/culture/2017/09/how-shows-like-star-trek-discovery-stick-to-canon.html)” as much as anyreasonable human being, but I’m not sure this sort of boundary-pushing is actually productive. Is anythingbeing accomplished? Other than marking *Discovery* forever as *not* “[family-friendly entertainment](https://www.quora.com/What-would-Gene-Roddenberry-have-thought-of-the-use-of-the-F-word-in-Star­Trek-Discovery)?” Linguistically, the word “fucking” in “fucking cool” was used for emphasis, which perhapssuggests there was no other way for the character to express that level of enthusiasm. In his [*IndieWire*interview](https://www.indiewire.com/2017/10/star-trek-discovery-anthony-rapp-interview-fuck­1201887710/), Anthony Rapp (Paul Stamets) explains: 
> “These people just put their brains to work in a really tough way and they had a breakthrough. And Iimagine there’s scientists in their labs who might do that any time. We didn’t drop the F-bomb in ‘Star Trek’by telling something to go fuck themselves. It’s like we did it by saying ‘this is fucking cool.'” 
![Stamets in the Spore Drive](https://i.snap.as/9epUHlp.png) 
If *Discovery* was “making history,” I’m not so sure what [*Star Trek: Picard*](https://bilge.world/star­trek-picard-review) was doing with *fucking* and *pissant*. I’m also not sure it matters at all in the granderscheme. What other freedoms should CBS feel free to explore, now that they’ve said the bad words? Whatelse hasn’t been explored? Bathrooms? Shitting and farting? That has my vote. I really don’t remember asmany colloquialisms showing up in the earlier series, but perhaps that’s just because those colloquialismshave since become part of our language. I’m not the greatest television watcher of all time, but I got lost in*Discovery*’s plot, and apparently I’m [not the only one](https://slate.com/culture/2018/02/star-trek­discovery-season-1-reviewed.html). 
> There turned out to be too many of those twists in Discovery’s first season, and it was frustrating to watchas the writers sidled up to new, risky frontiers for exploration, only to suddenly change course right whenthings were starting to get interesting. 
Season 1, Episode 7 is called “[Magic to Make the Sanest Man Go Mad](https://subslikescript.com/series/Star_Trek_Discovery-5171438/season-1/episode-7­
Magic_to_Make_the_Sanest_Man_Go_Mad),” and it’s the most classically *Star Trek* of what I’ve seen. Oneof those stuck-in-a-time-loop stories which truly makes you want to die. What’s even better and slightlymeta: playback kept resetting for me at exactly 21:26 and starting from the beginning while the cat keptstepping on the delete key and destroying this paragraph. I had to keep watching the man from *The*Fucking *Office* continually kill the captain after the crew parties to 250-year-old West Coast hip hop and*300*-year old Al Green all whilst writing this over again. I do not like Rainn Wilson invading my *StarTrek*. He gives Aquariuses a bad name and… beard. “Listen, petunia, I've been screwed over since the dayI was born. I deserve this,” he says, and I wonder if in fact it is Rainn himself speaking of his invasion. Helooks and sounds like a fucking incel. All of this makes me wonder if my entire problem with this show issimply that I do not particularly like its characters. 
![USS Discovery](https://i.snap.as/hcE6DfB.png) 
## The Vessel 
Relying on *Memory Alpha* – a tried-and-true *Star Trek* fan resource – we can examine [the U.S.S.*Discovery*](https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/USS_Discovery), itself. I’m not so sure about thisspore drive shit. If the NCC-1701 *Enterprise* was indeed [launched in 2245](https://www.startrek.com/database_article/enterprise), its existence would blatantly overlap with*Discovery*’s, now wouldn’t it? I don’t actually care all that much, but here are a few screenshots from[*Star Trek Online*](https://www.arcgames.com/en/games/star-trek-online/news/detail/10772124-the­discovery-lock-box!). 
![USS Discovery - Star Trek Online](https://i.snap.as/HLtOMGj.jpg) 
![USS Discovery - Star Trek Online](https://i.snap.as/X6cmK4K.jpg) 
Note how much larger this *Crossfield­*-class ship is than the *Intrepid*-class from some [120 years into the
future](https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Intrepid_class). Then again, the latter was designed for“long-range exploration missions” and *Discovery* is the fleet’s flagship(?) Its “most advanced ship,” atleast. The inclusion of technologies like the [holodeck](https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Holodeck)and the [spore drive](https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Spore_drive) (perhaps the show’s most potentplot device,) though, are really stretching the canon timeline’s ability to accommodate them. The decision to[include the *Discovery*](https://www.arcgames.com/en/games/star-trek-online/news/detail/10772124-the­discovery-lock-box!) as a playable, top-tier ship in *Star Trek Online* is 100% a business one, surely. I’mnot here to judge, though – after all, games are about having *fun*, right? One of *Star Trek*’s ironies hasalways been its existence in a capitalist society as an IP within a [debatably socialist future](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/24/opinion/make-it-so-star-trek-and-its-debt-to-revolutionary­socialism.html). (Everybody wants to see their [own ideal socioeconomic label](https://cameronharwick.com/blog/the-political-philosophy-of-star-trek/) in this future, it would seem.)“What makes *Star Trek*’s economics fundamentally different, and, in many ways, fundamentallyincomprehensible to us, is that scarcity is no longer a factor,” says [Dale Franks](https://medium.com/@dalefranks/is-star-trek-socialist-83f766828b33). Today, though, *Star Trek*properties still require finite resources and labor to produce, and they always have. Atari spent [over $50million](https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/atari-acquires-cryptic-studios) to acquire Cryptic Studios –the original developers of *Star Trek Online* – and *Discovery* supposedly cost “$[6-7 million per episode](https://variety.com/2016/tv/news/bryan-fuller-showrunner-star-trek-discovery-cbs-1201901398/).” Thoughthe former is free-to-play, it’s filled with microtransactions and about 5 billion different currencies. When[*Star Trek.com* says](https://www.startrek.com/news/ten-years-of-star-trek-online) “*Star Trek Online* isbest described as a permanent *Star Trek* convention,” they’re correct: **it is full of shit to buy**. 
There is also *a lot* of combat, though *Discovery* seems to have struck a healthy balance betweenwarfare and other intrigues. It is definitely *Trek* in many ways: redshirts die without any plot consequenceand all the classic character flaw tropes are represented. There is the aforementioned time loop episode withfucking Harry Mudd and even a mirror universe arc beginning with “[Despite Yourself](https://subslikescript.com/series/Star_Trek_Discovery-5171438/season-1/episode-10-Despite_Yourself),” inwhich the crew actually responds to their new environment and does the research required to blend in with the Terran forces. This took an ancient *Star Trek* format and actually explored a new, interesting avenuewithin it (the time loop episode did not.) They even change the *Discovery*’s registry on the hull to read“[ISS Discovery](https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/ISS_Discovery)” instead of “USS.” 
> Every moment is a test. Can you bury your heart? Can you hide your decency? Can you continue topretend to be one of them? Even as, little by little, it kills the person you really are. 
## Complaints 
There’s a reason we all hate Captain Lorca, and why he says things like “[sometimes the ends justify terriblemeans](https://subslikescript.com/series/Star_Trek_Discovery-5171438/season-1/episode-11­The_Wolf_Inside)” and “[there’s no way we’re asking *these* neighbors for a cup of sugar](https://subslikescript.com/series/Star_Trek_Discovery-5171438/season-1/episode-10-Despite_Yourself).” Ido not believe in Spoilers, but there’s not much reason for me to tell you why, specifically. Perhaps it is racistand/or misogynist to say so, but I found it difficult to get as attached to *Discovery*’s characters as I haveto those of series past. Michael is great, of course, though my girlfriend Sierra surmised that her purpose inthe show is to illustrate that “nobody listens to black women.” Sierra was also quite aggravated by themisunderstanding and mistreatment of the tardigrade. When Paul Stamets mentioned that his uncle Everettparticipated in a Beatles cover band, we both despaired, for we discovered an entry in *Memory Alpha* for“[The Beatles](https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/The_Beatles).” If I were to standardize a system ofmeasurement for my television ratings, *Discovery*’s **cringe factor** would be 9/10. The holodeck hasn’tbeen invented yet! 
Also, CBS All Access’ user interface is the worst I’ve ever seen from a streaming service, across iOS, desktopbrowser, and my Samsung television. It’s impossible to scrub, really, or to dictate a preference for highdefinition. One cannot navigate backward between episodes without re-searching the title and navigatingthrough an incredibly clunky menu sequence. I was able to cast to both my Samsung TV and Sierra’sChromecast from my iPhone, at least. 
![Star Trek Discovery - CBS All Access](https://i.snap.as/WvjZPUy.jpg) 
## Compliments 
Despite its failings (including Rainn Wilson,) *Discovery*’s acting is superb. [James Frain as Sarek](https://www.startrek.com/article/james-frain-joins-discovery-as-sarek), especially, is the best of the three. Ithought it was especially thoughtful that for the most part (at least in Season 1,) the Klingons *actuallyspoke Klingon* to each other. Given that [Dr. Marc Okrand](https://www.kli.org/about-klingon/klingon­history/) spent the time and effort to construct a fully-functional Klingon language, it seems only reasonableto include as much of it as possible. I also love [Hugh Culber](https://memory­alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Hugh_Culber)’s doctor’s uniform and the “cinematic” cinematography of the wholething. It’s very much an action show, yet not quite obnoxious. 
So, **should \*Star Trek\* die**? Perhaps it shows my extreme bias, but no, I do not think it need perishquite yet. From my (white, male, cishet) perspective, *Discovery* does an okay job at remaining thoroughly*Trek* whilst [acknowledging the present context’s social issues](https://www.newyorker.com/tech/annals­of-technology/for-alt-right-trolls-star-trek-discovery-is-an-unsafe-space). It remains a very capitalistenterprise and wholesomely cringey generation X cultural mastodon, but I think it’s still worth our time.

# Star Trek Online Lives ![USS Bataan over New Khittomer](https://i.snap.as/OwEhc8a.png) ## The ancient IP’s MMO is still Online, albeit with some disappointing discontinuations. 
I entertained fantasies about a *Star Trek* MMO since first experiencing the genre through *Eve Online*and *World of Warcraft* in early adolescence. The idea of commanding my own starship in a universe ofother “captains” alongside a hand-picked bridge crew was a beguiling one to myself and many others. Thisyear, the game celebrated its [ten-year anniversary](https://trekmovie.com/2020/01/29/star-trek-online­legacy-celebrate-10-years-of-sto-with-jeri-ryan-and-sonequa-martin-green/) (aligning well with the[continued involuntary beat](https://bilge.world/about) of this blog.) I’m currently in the midst of my annualcheck-in with STO and thought an exploration of this most-consequential video game of my life’s historywould be an appropriate undertaking. 
The execution of today’s final, Arc Games-owned and maintained product is a particularly long andinteresting one. As [Justin Olivetti chronicled for *Engadget*](https://www.engadget.com/2014-11-22-the­game-archaeologist-perpetuals-star-trek-online.html), the license for *Star Trek Online* was originally[bought](https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/perpetual-entertainment-to-develop-and-publish-star-trek­massively-multiplayer-online-game) and developed on by Perpetual Entertainment, which was assaulted by[a lawsuit](https://web.archive.org/web/20150127173934/http:/massively.joystiq.com/2007/12/12/perpetual-plot­thickens-lawsuit-filed) and extensive layoffs in December, 2006. The company was sued by KohnkeCommunications for allegedly selling "valuable assets like the Star Trek Online license" to an affiliated entitycalled P2 entertainment. Clever. A quote from the complaint as [reported by *Ten Ton Hammer*](https://web.archive.org/web/20150128203353/http:/www.tentonhammer.com/node/15616): 
> "On information and belief, the assets transferred to P2 include Perpetual Entertainment trademarks andcopyrights, the perpetual.com domain name, and assets related to Star Trek Online, including code and thelicense… Perpetual received less than market value for the assets it transferred to P2, and the transfer madePerpetual insolvent (or worsened Perpetual's existing insolvency)." 
[Perpertual’s STO](https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Star_Trek_Online_(Perpetual_Entertainment))was significantly different from today’s MMO. Instead of captaining one’s own starship, “players would havetaken on the role of an officer who would be part of a crew of a starship,” echoing old legacy titles like[*Star Trek: Bridge Commander*](https://www.ign.com/articles/2002/02/22/star-trek-bridge-commander­review). 
> The proposed solution was that players could own smaller ships like fighters and minor spaceships, but thebig ones -- like the Galaxy class -- would instead be adventure hubs with explorable, detailed interiors. 
![Perpetual Entertainment's Star Trek Online](https://i.snap.as/dswfpYb.jpg) 
I was 14 in 2008 when I joined the original post-Perpetual Entertainment STO IRC channel when the game'slicense was [first transferred](https://web.archive.org/web/20150203103236/http:/massively.joystiq.com/2008/01/14/star-trek-online-is­under-new-management/) to Cryptic Studios. In fact, this channel was the only reason I left IRC clients openon my computers for years. It was exciting to find a community of people who were looking forward toparticipating in a *Star Trek* MMO as much as I was. I originally went by the (very cringey) username"crazyhooligin," under which my current STO account is [still registered](https://ufplanets.com/member.php?13827-DavidBlue). In the IRC channel, I met Sata - host of the now-defunct [MMO Junkies podcast](https://eileenlong-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/g/personal/david_eileenlonglcsw_com/EV9rOQgmdINNpSWg2t_vXLwBMEMHCkqPUHOsoEX58AdkAg) and ex-Perpetual developer. He and the STORadio crew accepted me into their Teamspeakconversations despite how strange and unsocialized I was. I learned how [extensive](https://memory­alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Star_Trek_Online_(Perpetual_Entertainment)) and [beautiful] (https://johneaves.wordpress.com/2009/06/25/more-vulcans-from-the-perpetual-files/) their developmenthad been. One wonders what Cryptic did with the original game and art assets and who technically ownsthem now.

After [acquiring the rights](https://web.archive.org/web/20150203103236/http:/massively.joystiq.com/2008/01/14/star-trek-online-is­under-new-management/) to make the game in early-2008, Cryptic was legally compelled to come up with acompleted product in two years’ time as then-Executive Producer [Stephen D’Angelo](https://sto.gamepedia.com/Stephen_D'Angelo) explained on the [100th episode of the *STOked* podcast](https://youtu.be/a0tP0YrlJB0): 
> We were under a very massive deadline to deliver the game. We had acquired the license from Perpetualand Perpetual’s license had an expiration date on it, and we had to ship the game before the expiration dateor we would lose the license. 
*STOked* also provided an excellent historical account of the acquisition entitled “[How Cryptic Saved StarTrek Online](https://youtu.be/Fhed2yKVYwY).” By late-Fall, 2009, *Star Trek Online* [entered Closed Beta](https://trekmovie.com/2009/10/22/star-trek-online-begins-closed-beta-trekmovie-giving-away-keys/), whichI somehow acquired a key for in the name of [STOHolic.com](https://web.archive.org/web/20100521081251/http:/www.stoholic.com/) (a blogger site which representsone of my first web projects ever.) I was dual-booting Windows 7 Beta on my 2008 MacBook, which onlysupported 2 of its 4GB of RAM. The resulting performance was not optimal, but I was tremendously excitedjust to participate. Somewhere, there are at least three 480p handicam videos of Closed and Open Betagameplay taken from over my shoulder, but I could not find them at the time of this writing. Comparatively,beta looked drastically different from the property that’s online today. In [this video of the original entrytutorial](https://youtu.be/vH73ATZ96-w), we are introduced to the game’s basic controls by the voice ofZachary Quinto of J.J. Abrams fame as the new Emergency Medical Hologram in godawful dropshadowedtext. The lighting is dated, the blue-based user interface even more so. 
![Star Trek Online Closed Beta](https://i.snap.as/t0aZwfB.jpg) 
The hair was bad and the textures of the armor, worse. So was mine, though. I uploaded two videos undermy STOholic name: an [unboxing of the Collector’s Edition](https://youtu.be/pqGll-DZp6s) and what appearsto be [the definitive YouTube tutorial](https://youtu.be/ghUJm9YWiVc) to run *Star Trek Online* on MacOSX using the (now defunct) wineskin wrapper. Though I was sixteen years old, I appear to be about eight.Endless waves of ground enemies, pressing the "1" key hundreds of thousands of times to whittle themaway with my phaser rifle. There were bugs on top of bugs. My favorite was a swap between one's groundand space avatars: a gigantic captain would appear in space and a little ship would appear on the ground. 
Four years ago, Lead Developer Al Rivera wrote “[History of Star Trek Online – a Retrospective](https://www.arcgames.com/en/games/star-trek-online/news/detail/10095363-history-of-star-trek-online-–­a-retrospective)” – a blog post detailing the chronology of the game from its February 2nd, 2010 releasedate – about a week after my 16th birthday, for which my mom bought me my first and only gaming PC. Ihave never been very good at video games, and *Star Trek Online* has been no exception. After 10 years,my main Captain – Ambassador Kuvak – is still not doing adequate DPS to hold my own in [Task ForceOperations](https://sto.gamepedia.com/Task_Force_Operation), from what I understand. My 15-16-year-oldself chose a Science Captain but wanted to fly the great (engineering/tank-focused) cruisers of *The OriginalSeries*, *The Next Generation*, and the latter's movies. This is possible, but not necessarily advised.Generally, one specs an Engineering Captain to tank, a Tactical Captain for DPS, and a Science Captain for“[exotic DPS](https://youtu.be/v5by0pRMNx8)” and light healing. I managed to level a single sciencecharacter – the original – through to the max ranks using little intelligence and a lot of persistence. Later inlife, I’ve learned the patience for a more deliberate approach, but still struggle to make the numbers. 
## The Exploration System 
For many *Star Trek* fans, *Star Trek Online*’s combat feels excessive. Or at least, that’s what you’d think.The current reality is that search engine results for “[too much combat in STO](https://www.google.com/search?sxsrf=ALeKk02Vz7pYJlsD1Vn0gDTEJIsbJM6m6g%3A1589967215922&source=hp&ei=b_nEXvrvNZCstQbVuqu4Aw&q=star+trek+online+too+much+combat&oq=star+trek+online+too+much+combat&gs_lcp=CgZwc3ktYWIQAzoECCMQJzoFCAAQgwE6AggAOgYIABAWEB46CAghEBYQHRAeOgQIIRAKOgUIIRCgAToHCCEQChCgAVDFAlidHmDbH2gAcAB4AIABcYgBhhSSAQQzMS4xmAEAoAEBqgEHZ3dzLXdpeg&sclient=psy­ab&ved=0ahUKEwi64-24kcLpAhUQVs0KHVXdCjcQ4dUDCAk&uact=5)” are virtually nill. There are somecomments on [*Massively Overpowered* posts](https://massivelyop.com/2015/03/05/star-trek-online­installs-memorials-for-leonard-nimoy-and-all-those-lost/), a [year-old blog post in *Contains Moderate Peril*](http://www.containsmoderateperil.com/blog/2019/2/27/star-trek-online-non-combat-missions) by RogerEdwards, an old [Ryan Somna take](https://ideonexus.com/2010/01/25/star-trek-online-explore-strange­new-worlds-seek-out-new-life-and-new-civilizations-and-kill-them-looking-for-science-in-star-trek-online­beta/), and… that’s about it. There was a definite (and entirely reasonable) argument against the amount ofcombat across the community early in the game’s development, but it looks like the arguers have simmereddown and/or given up. This is also reasonable, considering its now ten-year lifespan. The only trouble is thatnon-combat options in *Star Trek Online* have actually diminished over the years. 
![Star Trek Online Romulan Borg](https://i.snap.as/BicLSE5.jpg) 
The original [Exploration System](https://sto.gamepedia.com/Exploration_Cluster) was an ingenious andsignificant idea that “[used automated tools to facilitate large quantities of widely varied content](https://www.arcgames.com/en/games/star-trek-online/news/detail/6002963-exploration-cluster-removal).”Unfortunately, the result was “nothing close to what [Cryptic] originally planned.” Instead of inspiringvariety, Exploration Clusters ended up becoming the most repetitive activity in the game – nothing morethan a good source of crafting materials. The missions were generic and the environments simply randomlycombined segments of the same interior textures. Procedurally generated environments would hit themainstream conversation years later with [*No Man’s Sky*](https://www.polygon.com/2016/8/12/12461520/no-mans-sky-review-ps4-playstation-4-pc-windows-hello­games-sony), which was written about in two fascinating articles by Raffi Khatchadourian in [*The NewYorker*](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/18/world-without-end-raffi-khatchadourian) andChris Baker in [*Rolling Stone*](https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-news/no-mans-sky-how­games-are-building-themselves-104779/): 
> Using procedural generation isn’t simply about offloading the creative process onto an algorithm – the realchallenge is that it requires developers to teach an algorithm the difference between good and bad gamedesign. 
Perhaps if *Star Trek Online*’s initial development window had not been so limited, Cryptic would’ve hadtime and resources to pioneer something truly *Trek* and extraordinary in the exploration system, but itended up having to kill the idea altogether – no amount of [Change.org petitions](https://www.change.org/p/cryptic-bring-exploration-to-star-trek-online-and-sto-back-to-the-true-roots-of­star-trek) could prevent this.

## The Foundry 
Perhaps *the* most innovative feature *Star Trek Online* contributed to gaming as a whole came to the liveserver in Spring, 2011. It was called [The Foundry](https://sto.gamepedia.com/The_Foundry), and it allowedplayers access to a diluted form of the same mission creation tools Cryptic themselves used to createcontent, enabling the community to publish its own playable stories. The result was a wonder virtuallyinexpressible in words. In player-made Foundry Missions, I found joy, wonder, sorrow, and insight – truly everything and more than one could ever want from fiction. Throughout 2013-2014 my girlfriend at the timeand I ran regular [Foundry missions](https://sto.gamepedia.com/Foundry:List_of_missions) together alongwith couple friends in our fleet. Unfortunately, I cannot remember a single specific mission (aside from[*Unholy Alliances*](https://youtu.be/zrXTZfHk4HQ), I think,) but I remember the storytelling. I rememberlaughing at, dwelling on, and even crying for the characters we were introduced to. There were farming-oriented missions and some fairly rough drafts, sure, but the vast majority of the content was deliberatelyand delicately considered, especially the [Foundry Spotlight](https://www.arcgames.com/en/games/star­trek-online/news/detail/3027483) series, which highlighted player-created stories of a particular quality andintrigue. 
![Ambassador Class](https://i.snap.as/CGCgrAb.jpg) 
Last April, however, [Arc retired the Foundry forever](https://www.arcgames.com/en/games/star-trek­online/news/detail/11102923) – perhaps the worst possible news – stating “the legacy knowledge requiredto maintain the Foundry at our quality standards is no longer available,” meaning – as [Rodger Edwardsnotes](http://www.containsmoderateperil.com/blog/2019/3/4/cryptic-to-close-the-foundry) – that alldevelopers with their hands, hearts, and heads in the project had long since departed the company. Thecommunity reaction was heartbreaking. On Reddit, a group of mission authors and devotees [committed tocapturing](https://www.reddit.com/r/sto/comments/ayobu4/one_mans_quest_to_save_the_foundry/) asmany Foundry Missions as possible on video in the month between the announcement and date of death.User [waimser](https://www.reddit.com/user/waimser/) lamented the loss of the Foundry as a critical hit to*Star Trek Online*’s endgame: 
> Once you've played through the story missions and built your ship, the foundry is what's left, and it hassome damn good stuff. 
The group even created a Google Docs spreadsheet to coordinate the effort. Another created [a thread inthe *Star Trek Online* forums](https://www.arcgames.com/en/forums/startrekonline#/discussion/1247628/keeping-up-with-the-foundry­after-the-foundry-general-psa-preserved-content) dedicated to “aggregating the various channels withFoundry content and providing those links to you and updating them as necessary.” In [an interview for*Gamesindustry.biz*](https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2020-02-11-how-star-trek-online-managed-to­live-long-and-prosper), Al Rivera suggested that the secret to the title’s longevity in which his team had been“strategically successful” was knowing when and when not to make drastic changes. “Don't change thefundamentals of what players love about your game,” he suggested. 
![UFP Fleet Roster](https://i.snap.as/Vuz4d3N.jpg) 
## Community 
Though *STOked* and *STORadio* have long since been off the air, the Roddenberry Podcast Network’s*PriorityOne* is still going strong, having just recorded [its 460th episode](https://priorityonepodcast.com/460-rebranding-kirk-casting-groupees-priority-one-a-roddenberry-star-trek­podcast/). As I discovered last year, the game’s Twitch community is also thriving. [Layiena](https://www.twitch.tv/layriena)’s streams are incredible because - while he understands theory as well asthe other broadcasters in the STO Twitch community - it’s his incredible skills at live Captain commentary(calling out abilities and other command inputs as if he really is in the captain’s chair.) It may sound cringey(and perhaps it would be to many,) but his thoroughness and accuracy actually 1) make it seem pretty darncool to me and 2) are hugely valuable in helping the viewer understand what he’s doing. After some threeyears, I know my one rotation fairly well, but only three or four of its steps by name – not even remotelywell enough to do what he does. Unfortunately, it appears as though he’s been inactive since last year. 
[Sphynx](https://www.twitch.tv/sphynx_sto)’s streams also have an especially professional feel – he isexcellent at calling out his actions as well, if perhaps without so much intensity. His Norwegian sensibility iswonderful: when I introduced myself as being around in the community since 2008, he remarked “that’sstrange considering the game has only been out since 2010.” Nigh-universally common threads amongthem: imperturbable kindness to their audience and an impressively wholesome commitment to *actually having fun*. Though I’m far from deeply saturated with Twitch culture as a whole, I’ve watched my fairshare of *Eve Online*, *World of Warships*, and *Gran Turismo Sport* streams, and – while all of thesehave incredible communities – there’s none quite like the sincerity of the *Star Trek* fraternity. 
A few weeks ago, I departed my own derelict STO fleet for the aptly-named [United Federation of Planets](https://ufplanets.com/) which has over three thousand (presumably at least semi-active) members in its[fleet armada](https://www.arcgames.com/en/games/star-trek-online/news/detail/9436793). The fleetwebsite has [user profiles](https://ufplanets.com/member.php?13827-DavidBlue), a [very active forum](https://ufplanets.com/forum.php), and a [Discord server](https://discord.gg/M6UKBVj) – everything I couldpossibly ask for. So far, I have been welcomed with [overwhelming positivity](https://ufplanets.com/showthread.php?78194-Application-DavidBlue), and I’m grateful. In a prompt postedon both [their forums](https://ufplanets.com/showthread.php?78339-Your-Favorite-Part-of-the-Community)and [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/sto/comments/gpyxcm/your_favorite_part_of_the_community/), Iasked players what their favorite part of the community is. Oddly enough, some of the responses I got fromthe latter were quite jaded: “I really enjoy the love and respect the PVP community gets. No, wait...” [AlexRowe for *The Startup*](https://medium.com/swlh/star-trek-online-ten-years-old-still-fun-eacd72b1380): 
> [The game’s subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/sto/) is full of folks who are tired of the game becausethey’ve blasted through all the content, but as someone who has only seen about 1/6th of the questscurrently in the game, I’m eager to check out more. 
User [JediMasterx4](https://www.reddit.com/user/JediMasterx4/) seemed [particularly disgruntled](https://www.reddit.com/r/sto/comments/gpyxcm/your_favorite_part_of_the_community/frsanzq?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x): 
> You can do all the lockbox promo vids you want, but you are going to have to live in reality, no matterwhere your ego flies off to. 
However, there *were* some positives. User [ModestArk](https://www.reddit.com/user/ModestArk/): 
> What I really like about this community is that it seems to be more grown up than other gamingcommunities. Maybe this comes from Star Trek itself, since it is more based/focused on science than StarWars etc. 
[Jahoan](https://www.reddit.com/user/Jahoan/) recommends [StarSword’s series on the U.S.S. *Bajor*](https://www.fanfiction.net/u/5198322/StarSword-C) and [Jordanomega1](https://www.reddit.com/user/Jordanomega1/) vouched for [Captain Geronimo’s videos](https://www.youtube.com/user/jakovzlatar33).

## State of The Game 
This past January, *Star Trek Online: Legacy* was [launched](https://www.arcgames.com/en/games/star­trek-online/news/detail/11357563-star-trek%3A-legacy-now-live!), bringing *The Original Series*­referencing episodes *The Measure of Morality* parts [*I*](https://sto.gamepedia.com/Mission:_The_Measure_of_Morality_(Part_1)) and [*II*](https://sto.gamepedia.com/Mission:_The_Measure_of_Morality_(Part_2)) along with a new [10 yearanniversary event](https://sto.gamepedia.com/10_Year_Anniversary_Event) and the [Tier 6 KhitomerAlliance Battlecruiser](https://www.arcgames.com/en/games/star-trek-online/news/detail/11351133­command-the-first-klingon%2Ffederation-ship!) – “the first Klingon/Federation Starship.” I did not participatein the event, save for experiencing the new missions, which I talked about in [my review of *Star Trek:Discovery*](https://bilge.world/star-trek-discovery-review). JustGaming4Us produced an excellent, [in-depthvideo review](https://youtu.be/KHhakbz6q8s) of the two missions as well as a [tour of the event as a whole](https://youtu.be/M3KJkcCaymA). I, for one, have never been partial to Shiny New Ship gluttony largely because of how long it took me to “master” my own Intrepid-Class Retrofit – christened the U.S.S. *Bataan*after the aircraft carrier my grandfather served on in WWII – as much as I have. It took me years to arrangemy bridge officer abilities and their keybinds in such a way that I could maintain a fairly-steady dps rotationand I have no desire to go through the process of learning a new ship again. For most veteran players,however, trying out different ships/skill specs is all there is left to do. 
Choosing whether or not – or to whom – to recommend the game is an issue best left to actual gamingjournalists. In March, *Massively Overpowered* – the followup project to what was once *Massively.com* –published [Mia DeSanzo’s account](https://massivelyop.com/2020/03/30/mmo-cartographer-boldly-going­into-star-trek-online/) of her first experience in the game: 
> Everything you’ve heard is true. Ground combat is, as multiple sources have told me, “a hot mess.” I don’tthink clunky is an adequate descriptor. You’d have to try it. 
For the same site, [Tyler F.M. Edwards argued](https://massivelyop.com/2020/01/23/why-i-play-is-star-trek­online-worth-playing-in-2020/) in January that *Star Trek Online* is best left to those who already love *StarTrek*: 
> STO has some things going for it as a video game, and it’s certainly unique in the MMO space, but it hastoo many basis quality issues for it to be a game I’d recommend to someone who’s never watched anepisode of Star Trek. 
Compared to what I experienced all those years ago in Closed and Open Beta, *Star Trek Online* is now*vastly* more polished, but perhaps compared to other MMOs in 2020, it is, indeed, “rough.” In my casualreturn this past month, I have yet to experience any significant bugs. Considering his character data datesback to launch, I’d like to think that the server is set into some brief, confused panic every time I log in toKuvak, but perhaps that’s just a fantasy. I have still been enjoying the space combat in the classic Advanced-level [Borg Disconnected](https://www.arcgames.com/en/games/star-trek-online/news/detail/7003293-borg­disconnected) and [Counterpoint](https://www.arcgames.com/en/games/star-trek­online/news/detail/9527023-star-trek-online%3A-counterpoint) TFOs and my first entry into high-level gearupgrade crafting from the vast cache of materials I’ve built up over the years. . Apparently, my old lockboxcollection might actually be worth some significant Energy Credits on the Exchange – as of the time of thiswriting, however, not a one had yet to sell. 
![Constellation Class Retrofit](https://i.snap.as/R2MgVJD.jpg) 
If you’re a ship junkie who’s entirely unfamiliar with the property, know that *Star Trek*’s ships are *fuckingcute*. The [Nebula Class](https://www.startrek.com/article/inside-the-nebula-class-starship), especially,inspires real affection. In my opinion, it alone is worth giving this free-to-play game a shot. My two pointeight pound [Surface Laptop 2](https://extratone.com/microsoft-surface-laptop-2-review-windows-future) isenough to run it fairly well at medium-high settings, which is an absurdly low barrier-to-entry. You shouldn’tbe worried about investing your time, either – *Star Trek* doesn’t appear to be dying anytime soon.

## A highly-informed analysis. 
He named his dog Number One. His eyebag game disastrous. The Romulans are in a Borg Cube. They’reflirting in The Cube. It’s a Sex Cube. Its shields are very loud, now. They’re smoking weed on Weed Road.There is simply not enough runtime for a truly episodic television show anymore, is there? A Borg RomulanScott. (Imagine Borg snot.) *The shear fucking hubris*. There’s the F word again. *I didn’t know Romulanscould be so hot*. Jesus Christ. “I never really cared for science fiction – I just didn’t *get* it,” says Picard.Very funny, folks. 
Did he drop something or...? *Paradigmatic*. CBS’ closed captions are janky and I’m getting older by thesecond. They are in the Sex Cube again. The Star Trek OS looks like it has annoying notifications. A son?Using the term *Quest*. This is segregation. The *Nightingale* was a [slave ship](http://www.bruzelius.info/Nautica/Ships/Clippers/Nightingale%281851%29.html). This is not lost on me.Spanish speaking! Nothing about operating these ships is visceral at all. Hey! Jeri Ryan! These CBS All Accessads are absolutely bizarre. Icheb is here!? Jesus what a coincidence. Oh. 
![Star Trek Jowls](https://i.snap.as/m7hZ1W0.png) 
TECHNO FUTURE. That head tilt was sudden. Romulans are freaking out in English, for some reason. ColonelJane - Sterling’s young wife - is still a bitch. What a surprise. I still haven’t gotten tired of the introductorycredits’ theme. *Pissant*, really? “And now the windmills have turned out to be giants.” I have no idea whatthat’s referencing. Admirals should not say *shut the fuck up*. The holograms are just different levels ofScottish according to their class. Did they do this just to make sure Scots continued to be represented in*Star Trek*? Why does Rios have so many pips? What rank would he be if he put all of them on? God?**ALISON PILL**. Dr. Pill. 
> Fear is the great destroyer. 
Coordinated bonk. “We’re at a threshold” is not political at all. If I was watching this show by the week, Iwould be very frustrated by its pace. Very sad about the Orchid deaths. They were cute. They mentioned thePicard Maneuver correctly. Jonathan Frakes directed this. Seven of Nine just said “same,” but we will forgiveBrent Spiner for aging and - I hope - for [dying](https://www.digitalspy.com/tv/ustv/a31959862/star-trek­picard-brent-spiner-finished-playing-data/). 
I think we probably should’ve let ourselves let Picard die.

# Stairs, Wiggling 
![Fin from The Star War](https://i.snap.as/WZE6gzb.jpeg) 
'Twas was the night after Christmas (I think,) and I was in the same scroogy mood I must maintain forconsistency of appearances *&* equilibrium of family dynamics every year. Everywhere, there were wordson the newest Stair Wiggling…everywhere THEY were wiggling… And I was being wit-bitter on the TL. Foryou, I’d planned on continuing in the usual way, so as not to startle your precious Hans Zimmer-embossedheart. 
I’m sure you’re a tolerable being, and there’s nothing you’d rather read less at this hour (whatever hour itmay be,) but I really despise going to the movies. I always end up getting sick from the popcorn, which Ibuy every outing because I have grown weary and weathered, and cannot sit for two straight hours withoutconsuming something, so troubled is my stomach now with Big Boy woes. 
I can never escape the ambient breath odor — even in an empty theatre — and I can smell the filth in theseats on my clothes and in my hair until I shower. This is at least an hour-long process, so we’ve racked upa significant trauma bill without even accounting for travel time. 
*Furious 7* was the last theatre experience I’d had, and it was a definite exception. Despite watching tenminutes of the ending on YouTube beforehand thanks to much-appreciated warnings from friends, I spentthe final few frames before the credit roll honorably combatting the industrial weepy forces in my throat withtripplet labor breathing exercises while my dusty ducts piddled buttery tears all over my jacket. 
As we age, straightforwardly emotional experiences (like watching a movie) become exhaustingly morecomplex and fickle. I don’t remember ever REALLY disliking a film as a child, for better or worse. I think Igenuinely enjoyed all ~40 times I’ve sat through *Cadet Kelly.* 
*Star Wars*, though, is a completely different thing. 
To children, chocolate is like water [insert dystopian, but probably more metaphorically effective foodexample here] — it’s something you’d regularly consume as it is made available. Perhaps some foodiststreasured it more, but I wouldn’t bother debating it. *Star Wars*, though, is like chocolate and Corvette. It’sSUCH an indulgence that even children are self-aware enough to recognize it, which is especially notableconsidering how many individuals I’ve known as they’ve lost nothing BUT their unlimited wanting when they“became” adults. 
Metatots aside, it’s important to recognize how integral the IP’s illusion of limitlessness is to its appeal. It isnot contained within the future of humanity, near or distant. The stories, characters, species, cultures, andconflicts come from *a long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away*… There is no more perfectly conciseintroductory sentence to unshackle us from our history and our planet, sparing us from the ridiculouslyirrational instinct to make comparisons between fictional realities and our own that so plagues and definesthe consumption of science fiction. 
These processes are often welcome, of course, but they tether us to ourselves and our familiars, which tendsto hinder the complete manifestation of the *ultimate* sense of adventure.Even to the most petty plot ponderers, the time and effort it requires to arrive in *Star Wars* withexternally-acquired foreknowledge is not a worthwhile investment. This is why so many (including myself)look upon *A New Hope* with such fondness and favoritism — the premier of the universe was at itspotential apogee from the start. 
Though it is inviting with its ellipses and cooling hue, that title card is actually saying “you don’t know shitabout what you’re about to see. Don’t make the mistake of trying to be the first one to dissect it, becauseyou’ll fail, regardless of how cultured or analytically superior you are. From this moment until you see credits,every one of you is an ignorant little child…” 
When experience cannot possibly be applied, it becomes irrelevant. Without your experiences, you are aninfant, waiting for identity. Over that Genesis, the curtains brushed aside any quantity of memories andmade theatres into a sort of cultural nursery — clinically levelled playing fields existing in a precision ofusefulness that expression will never fulfill again. 
The real cancer of the property is lore, and the parasitic authorities it enables have been unknowinglyslurping away its most enchanting (but not exclusive) value since the moment they first pushed throughthose double-portholed doors and, groggily squinting, brought this supremely strange universe into the dankkernel-littered corridors of our own. 
I blame contemporary society’s dependency on compartmentalization for my disappointment in *The ForceAwakens*, and, assuming you’re getting on a bit since I’ve kept your attention, you should for yours, too. 
I tried my senile best to be passionate about “the new *Star Wars* movie” as December approached, but Idon’t think I finished a single web article on the subject. I had begun my brief return to *The Old Republic*when the hilted lightsaber image was leaked and distinctly remember overhearing some very weary VoIPexasperation from my (VERY middle-aged) raid group. “It’s not gonna be the same, but neither was J.J.‘s*Star Trek*, and I liked it…I think.” And it’s not surprising that the conversation eventually turned to thespecific mechanics of lightsaber design, chronological positing, and the like, given the context, but it reallyemphasized for me the magnitude of the history and nostalgia weighing upon the collective dad emotionalbalance. *A New Hope* had the intended effect on me, of course, but couldn’t possibly imburden itself as ithad on those who were in the moment. In their psyche, that experience will be eternally associated with thesense of unlimited potential their childhood ignorance allowed for. These folk who are so often stereotypedas disciples of information have begun to grow weary, and are desperately seeking sanctuary from the massof all the knowledge they’ve picked up since. Their need made a market; J.J. made a movie. (Well, six.)Today’s moms and dads find their escape in the Roku, not the bar. *The Force Awakens* and the decade ofrevivalist big-budgeters preceding it are the reformed druggie’s drug. 
Because we both know you haven’t yet read anything you haven’t heard/read previously, I’ve really justbeen playing the role of a (more intelligent) Ghandi, but we’ve now finally arrived at some promising insightinto the real issue: this culture is one of fatal contradiction. Despite its historical popularity, it’s ill-advisableto want to know by day what you try to forget at night. Since the PT Cruiser was allowed to go on sale,you’ve all been caught up in a nostalgic hellride that can only end with the ultimate destruction of all culture.You now know, definitively, what role *The Force Awakens* was created to perform. Depending on whetheror not you welcome the end of everything, it fills it…adequately. 
There are Baddie Red Brits and Cool Brown Moderate Americans in their X-Things, moving swiftly, acting indiversity, and generally heaving moral streaks of energy at the Intolerable Imperialists, just as they should!Sometimes, they yell and die! But it’s ok, because they’re all just loyal martyrs making their obligatory andpatriotic sacrifice for the rebellion against the Queen! 
Um. 
I mean… the Smug Cowards in their big taxation balloon!

I must confess that I did feel something huge when the lights dimmed, the aforementioned disclaimerappeared, and the theme’s jarring introductory chord hit me in the face, beginning the opening crawl. Iactually smiled *involuntarily*, which is tremendously embarrassing to admit because the warmth I felt wasexactly the sensation that defined my childhood experiences with the franchise. I even had a gigantic modelof the *Moderate Fashion*, which would now be worth a lot of money (or so I’m told,) had it not been sodamaged in my frivolous storage. 
Unfortunately, that frisky feeling of adventure promptly wisped through the screen’s grasp after the“obligatory” scrolling yellow text -> “there’s a big spaceship moving slowly” transition. Aside from theadorably entrancing romantic tension between Timid Traitor and Sentimental Squatter, there was nothingvery *Star Wars* about anything I saw. The cards were a deceiving gate into a world that was distinctly NOT*Star Wars*. There’s no need to mess about; it’s clearly an alternate reality from the one we’ve known. J.J.‘s*Star Trek*was in such a way, too, but it was explicitly identified as such by the production. Traditionally,Lucas’ IP wouldn’t necessarily allow for this exemption, but nobody’s been all that vocal in confronting it, tomy knowledge. 
The world expected both of these forays to rejuvenate the franchise, which would serve my argument, wereit not for the (much preferable) alternative:**LET THEM DIE**. 
Despite millions of dollars worth of polish, they’ve still ended up feeling like a strange reanimationexperiment. 
Your son is **DEAD**, Georgino. There are some things man would do better by leaving alone and movingon. Imagine all that cash and creative talent spent on *new ideas* instead of desperate attempts to charmand cultivate the shallowest part of moviegoers’ spectrum. *So much sweat* shed trying to recreate the*new franchise* bewitchment is embarrassingly cowardly when one could just *create a new franchise*.

# Concerning Discovery in Streaming Music 
![Dark Wrapped 2020 - Spotify](https://i.snap.as/BROnhF3Z.png) 
## Reclaiming tastemaking for listeners in the Spotify era. 
Last week, Spotify users were treated to the service’s annual “[Spotify Wrapped](https://newsroom.spotify.com/2020-12-01/6-new-features-to-unwrap-in-your-spotify-2020-wrapped/)”feature: a visual summary of an account’s listening habits throughout the year, including their most listened-to artists. New for 2020 are “in-app quizzes,” a chronological “Story of Your 2020,” and detailed podcastlistening statistics. For premium users, “badges” will “crown listeners with various titles based on the waysthey listened.” 
> For example, if a number of your playlists gained significant new followers, you’ll be a *Tastemaker.* Ifyou listened to a song before it was cool (aka hit 50,000 streams), you’ll get the *Pioneer* badge. Andbased on the number of songs you added to playlists this year, you just might become a *Collector*. 
Their use of the term *Tastemaker* is particularly interesting. “Tastemaking" - a function once relegated tomagazines - has taken a concerning bent in the Algorithmic Age. Very much contemporary terms like “[filterbubble](https://megaphone.link/VMP4291212808)” and “[echo chamber](https://www.culturedmag.com/shouts-echo-chamber/)” – applied more and more often to social platformslike Facebook and Twitter, now – can also be associated with music streaming services like Spotify, who’s“playlistification” of content has had a number of alarming effects on American culture. 
![Premium Badges - Spotify](https://i.snap.as/jKs57Tfw.png) 
In 2018, *The Baffler*’s Liz Pelly explored Spotify playlists’ gender bias in “[Discover Weekly](https://thebaffler.com/latest/discover-weakly-pelly):” 
> On Today’s Top Hits, I found that over the course of one month, 64.5 percent of the tracks were by menas the lead artist, with 20 percent by women and 15.5 percent relying on collaborations between men andwomen artists. When all features were taken into consideration, I found that 85.5 percent of tracks includedmen artists, while only 45.5 percent included women. This was one of the highest percentages of womenartists out of all the playlists I examined. 
She also quotes a LinkedIn post by “Jerry Daykin, the Head of Media Partnerships at Diageo,” in which heobserves, “The most popular tracks on Spotify get featured in more playlists and become even more popularas a result.” In January of the same year, the online music magazine *Pitchfork* published an op-ed bymusician Damon Krukowski entitled “[How to Be a Responsible Music Fan in the Age of Streaming](https://pitchfork.com/features/oped/how-to-be-a-responsible-music-fan-in-the-age-of-streaming/),” whichprovided concrete statistics on this phenomenon (emphasis mine:) 
> According to the data trackers at [BuzzAngle Music](http://www.buzzanglemusic.com/), [on Spotify,] morethan **99 percent of audio streaming is of the top 10 percent most-streamed tracks**. Which means **lessthan 1 percent of streams account for all other music**. 
“While streaming media is pitched to us as tailored to our taste, or at least to our browsing history,”Krukowski goes on to note, “the business of it is in fact closer to one-size-fits-all.” Clearly, this is an issue,but technically **only insofar as Spotify advertises itself as a means to discover new music**, which [it doesconsistently](https://www.spotify.com/us/about-us/contact/). 
The company has faced criticism in other areas, most recently by *The New Yorker*’s Alex Ross in a widely-read review of “[Decomposed: The Political Ecology of Music](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/decomposed),”a new book by University of Oslo professor Kyle Devine, entitled “[The Hidden Costs of Streaming Music](https://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/the-hidden-costs-of-streaming-music).” Ross firstcites a statement by Spotify CEO Daniel Elk, “The artists today that are making it realize that it’s about creating a continuous engagement with their fans,” arguing the true meaning of his words to be “to make aliving as a musician, you need to claw desperately for attention at every waking hour.” His most original (asin, yet to be considered in the mainstream discourse) argument, though, involves the service’senvironmental impact. He cites Devine’s depiction of a profound cultural delusion surrounding theconsumption of music, suggesting that music is “seen as a special pursuit that somehow transcends theconditions of its production.” 
> In a chapter on the digital and streaming era, Devine drives home the point that there is no such thing asa nonmaterial way of listening to music: “The so-called cloud is a definitely material and mainly hardwirednetwork of fiber-optic cables, servers, routers, and the like.” This concealment of industrial reality, behind aphantasmagoria of virtuality, is a sleight of hand typical of Big Tech, with its genius for persuadingconsumers never to wonder how transactions have become so shimmeringly effortless. 
Also noteworthy are questions of Spotify’s viability as a business, which Ross includes by citing [a July articlein *Barrons*](https://www.barrons.com/articles/spotifys-losses-widen-as-subscribers-keep-growing­51596034688) quoting Spotify Technology’s second-quarter earnings report: “The streaming music companylost $418 million, or $2.24 per share, versus analysts’ expectations for a 41-cent loss.” Spearheading thisyear’s news conversation surrounding the company, though, were its widespread acquisitions in thePodcasting industry, including [Anchor](https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/6/18213462/spotify-podcasts­gimlet-anchor-acquisition), [Megaphone](https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/10/21557458/spotify­megaphone-podcast-streaming-ad-insertion), [Gimlet Media](https://www.vox.com/2019/2/7/18214941/alex-blumberg-matt-lieber-gimlet-spotify-deal-acquisition-peter­kafka-media-podcast-audio-interview), and – [most controversially](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/25/opinion/joe-rogan-spotify-podcast.html) – the exclusive rights to themost listened-to property in the medium, [*The Joe Rogan Experience*](https://www.theverge.com/21265005/spotify-joe-rogan-experience-podcast-deal-apple-gimlet-media­ringer). Though details of their implications are beyond the scope of this essay, it is reasonable to assume itsconcerns – if not its proposed solutions – should apply to the future of podcasting as well. 
## Responsible Curation 
For solutions to address Spotify’s overwhelming skew toward rewarding popular music with even morepopularity, we can first look within its own history to just a few years earlier, when human curation wasmore equally matched in its fight against algorithmic curation. In 2015, the company claimed that “[Half ofSpotify users stream from other users’ playlists at least monthly](https://pitchfork.com/features/article/9686­up-next-how-playlists-are-curating-the-future-of-music/).” *Pitchfork*’s Marc Hogan profiled a number of“power users” within the upper percentile in terms of followers and personal playlist popularity. Notably, allof his examples are male. 
Generally, human curation should hypothetically combat its algorithmic counterpart in terms of favoringalready commercially successful content, if not its gender disparity. The industry’s other biggest player,Apple Music, has invested heavily and successfully in the former. (Disclosure: I have been an Apple Musicsubscriber since its launch.) *Fast Company* addressed this contrast in a 2018 long read entitled “[Spotify’s$30 billion playlist for global domination](https://www.fastcompany.com/90205519/spotifys-playlist-for­global-domination):” 
> Cook’s words embody Apple’s longstanding critique of Spotify, which is that its algorithms are erodingmusic’s spiritual role in our lives. Cook doesn’t mention Spotify by name but says, “We worry about thehumanity being drained out of music, about it becoming a bits-and-bytes kind of world instead of the art andcraft.” 
Then again, the same article also quotes Tim Cook – the CEO of the most valuable company in the history ofthe world – as insisting “We’re not in it for the money.” In turn, Daniel Elk is quoted, saying “Music iseverything we do all day, all night, and that clarity is the difference between the average and the really,really good,” though what exactly he is quantifying as “really, really good” is not entirely clear. In context,the words of both leaders seem untrustworthy – vague, at best.

In tremendous and relevant contrast to the voices of these CEOs is that of Ethan Diamond, CEO and co-founder of Bandcamp, a music streaming service unlike any other. In [an interview with Music Tech Festdirector Andrew Dubber this May](https://mtflabs.net/podcast076/), Diamond exemplifies an entirelydifferent mentality in running a for-profit service for independent music artists. 
In 2007, Diamond and former colleagues Shawn Grunberger, Joe Holt, and Neal Tucker set out to build theequivalent of blogging services like Blogger, WordPress, MovableType, etc. for musicians. As Holt bemoanedin [a 2008 interview with *The HTML Times*](http://htmltimes.com/band-camp.php), creating an onlinepresence for one’s music had long been “a pain in the ass:”[^1] 
> You need to find a place to host it, you’ve gotta get the metadata right, it’s just hard. So we just decidedwe would do that hard part for musicians so that they didn’t have to be so nerdy. 
From its very origin, the team designed Bandcamp to make the process of publishing one’s music as easy aspossible. In [the first post on the company’s blog from September, 2008](https://blog.bandcamp.com/2008/09/16/hello-cleveland/), Diamond details the results of their engineering: 
> We keep your music streaming and downloading quickly and reliably, whether it’s 3am on a Sunday, or thehour your new record drops and Pitchfork gives it a scathingly positive review. We make your tracksavailable in every format under the sun, so the audiophilic nerderati can have their FLAC and eat mp3 v2.We adorn your songs with all the right metadata, so they sail into iTunes with artwork, album, band andtrack names intact. We mutter the various incantations necessary to keep your site top-ranked in Google, sowhen your fans search for your hits, they find your music long before they find bonkersforlyrics.com oriMyFace. We give your fans easy ways to share your music with their friends, and we give you gorgeoustools that reveal exactly how your music is spreading, so you can fan the fire. 
In the years since, Bandcamp has demonstrated time and time again the sincerity in its commitment toartists through programs like “Bandcamp Fridays,” when the service waives its cut of artists’ revenue (tenpercent on physical releases, fifteen percent of digital.) In 2017, the company [donated a Friday’s share ofproceeds to the Transgender Law Center](https://pitchfork.com/news/bandcamp-donating-proceeds-to­transgender-law-center-this-friday/) in response to the Presidential Administration’s proposal to ban transpeople from serving in the U.S. military. This year, throughout the Coronavirus pandemic, the company hasrepeatedly [brought back the program](https://daily.bandcamp.com/features/bandcamp-covid-19-fundraiser)in recognition of its impact on independent artists, and the results have been profound. On March 20th, for aspecific example, $4.3 million worth of purchases was distributed. 
Unlike Spotify, Bandcamp *is* a profitable company, and has been for nearly a decade. In Dubber’sinterview, Diamond explains their financial origins: 
> In 2007/2008 we took a little bit of VC funding and then focused on getting to profitability. So we did thatand got there in 2012, and that’s helped us maintain the mission, maintain the vision that we’ve had for thecompany for a long time. 
Also in contrast to Spotify, Bandcamp explicitly invests in less popular, fringe content, through its onlinepublication the [*Bandcamp Daily*](https://daily.bandcamp.com): 
> The mission of the Daily, it’s our editorial arm, and it’s just to highlight this incredibly diverse world ofmusic that’s on a site where anybody can upload anything. And the result of that is that you have weirdsubgenres and a lot of music, I think, that wouldn’t necessarily be covered anywhere else. 
Bandcamp has long demonstrated an anthesis to the business models technology companies have been socriticized for upholding and has done so in relative obscurity from the media. In his interview, Dubber asksDiamond one of the primary questions prompting the creation of this essay: “how come Bandcamp doesn’t get mentioned in all these press articles about music services?” In answer, Diamond offers his own businessdecisions out of “[his] personal preference:” 
> I like the idea that Bandcamp hangs out in the background and just makes all of this stuff work, and also,hopefully, helps the artist promote themselves, and it’s not about “Bandcamp, Bandcamp, Bandcamp.”[^2] 
As a *Tastemaking* enterprise, Bandcamp has combined magazine-style editorial publishing with user-created content in the form of Collections – which allow listeners to display music they’ve purchased on acustomizable web page – and Artist Recommendations, which extend from a creator’s Collection to thosewho follow them. This system has demonstrably lead to community and cultural wellness by genre viaresponsible commentary and selection from curating creators with authority, while still profiting its parentcompany tremendously. Bandcamp has grown from four to seventy employees in its 13-year lifespan, [whilehelping artists earn $634 million](https://bandcamp.com/about) as of December 2020. In the music industry,it is unquestionably an outlier. Diamond inadvertently explains Bandcamp’s success in response to a questionfrom Dubber on the company’s comparatively slow pace in terms of technological features (emphasis mine:) 
> Deciding what to work on next, that has always felt like the easiest part of the job because it’s whateverbenefits artists the most. Because **the way Bandcamp makes money is if artists make a lot more money**,so that’s what we try to spend every day doing. 
The solution to the “debacle” of streaming music, then, is not necessarily charity or socioeconomicrevolution. It would seem that all it takes is a sincere investment in the real people who create music. 
[1] While Bandcamp set out from the beginning to make it easier for artists to publish music, getting musicon Spotify has always been a grueling process. 
[2] I fully intended to quote Kaitlyn Tiffany on how organizations *only* get tech media attention if asignificant amount of capital is involved in some form, but I haven’t been able to find it. I’ll certainly comeback and add it if/when I do.

# Craig Toomey's Coronavirus 
![The Langoliers](https://i.snap.as/DGO3fQ4.jfif) 
## In Stephen King's "The Langoliers," the state of today's air travel is foreshadowed. 
I told myself I would not be topical - that I would publicly ignore the coronavirus - but I can no longer. There is simply too much to say about one of the most emotionally effective, surreal films of my childhood. *The Langoliers* occupied 9-11PM's slot on ABC for May 14th and 15th, 1995 (Sunday and Monday, twenty-five years ago.) It's an adaptation of a [Stephen King novel](https://www.amazon.com/Langoliers-Stephen-King/dp/1982136057) of the same title and is fairly widely-regarded as [the worst such adaptation](https://letterboxd.com/yojrb/film/the-langoliers/) of all time. You can now watch the whole three hours of *The Langoliers* in 360p (supposedly) at your leisure [thanks to OpenTube] (https://open.tube/videos/watch/397129b2-25fc-49c0-a802-881c5dad5b06?title=0&warningTitle=0&controls=0) (for now.) One commenter (on the since-taken-down YouTube video) echoes what I'm about to tell you: "My god! I thought I dreamed this movie up as a kid. I have been trying to describe this to people for years and here it is, itâ€™s real!" In order to write this, I joined the [Stephen King Wiki Discord server](https://discord.gg/X3bAngj) and was immediately welcomed with a request not to type in the text channels: "Iâ€™m working on adding some new channels so pls nobody type in them til Iâ€™m done." 
<iframe width="auto" height="auto" sandbox="allow-same-origin allow-scripts" src="https://open.tube/videos/embed/397129b2-25fc-49c0-a802-881c5dad5b06?title=0&warningTitle=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe> 
*The Langoliers* begins with a pissed-off British secret agent (Mark Lindsay Chapman,) an insane businessman (Bronson Pinchot,) a psychic, vision-impaired young woman (Kate Maberly,) Sarah Jessica Parker (Patricia Wettig,) and a *just*-widowed pilot (David Morse) all boarding the same redeye flight to Boston - American Pride Flight 29. This group falls asleep and mysteriously wakes up alone on the aircraft except for Stephen King himself (Dean Stockwell,) a stupid incel violinist (Christopher Collet,) and a stoner (Kimber Riddle.) My favorite character, Craig Toomey, is the "twerp" business boy with daddy issues who can't stop himself from demanding to know what's going on. James Bond shuts him up with a "nose hold." 
> Whoa. No one's driving the plane! 
David Morse proceeds to try and contact air traffic control in a fairly-realistic manner, but is unable to receieve any radio signals at all, even from Strategic Air Command. Frankie Faison plays the single person of color on the flight, Don Gaffney - "a tool and die worker for Hughes Aircraft" - who dies first, of course. James Bond lecures David about inciting panic and almost immediately reveals his secret identity. Then, the Hungry Idiot (Baxter Harris) wakes up whilst Toomey begins screaming again. 
> Scaring the little girl? Scaring the little girl?! Lady, we're diverting to some tin-pot airport in the middle of nowhere, and I've got better things to think about than scaring the little girl! 
After the entirety of the male cast threatens to beat him up, Toomey, sweating his balls off, begins slowly tearing strips of paper and moaning sexually like an absolute madman. Some irritiatingly irrelevant dialogue insues in which Stephen King Author Man narrates through Sherlock Holmes deduction to figure absolutely nothing out. He is wearing stripes on plaid. He suggests that the entire situation could be some sort of government experiment and I can't believe I'm wasting your time with this. "If it were just this plane, I could give you a scenario, but unfortunately, it's not just this plane. The city of Denver is probably still down there, but all its lights were off if it was." Here you can see how excellently [this script](https://eileenlong­my.sharepoint.com/:b:/g/personal/david_eileenlonglcsw_com/EUcVc3WXy4FLkBEtbl6ZOkgBXJSgV9zkQlACXEaq3 U3DJQ) was written. 
> I've been sitting here running all these old stories through my head. You know, time warps, space warps, alien raiding 
parties. I mean, we really don't know if there's anything left down there, do we? 
Sarah Jessica Parker reveals to Powers Girl that she's on her way to meet a guy she's been emailing with. Stoner girl asks if everything is going to be okay and Incel Violinist looks horny. She's going to rehab for stones. The captain announces to his nine passengers that they're beginning their descent into Bangor International Airport, near Stephen King's birthplace. Don asks Toomey to stop ripping up paper and the useless food addict yells "well, at least we'll be able to get some chow when we land" offscreen. Craig, sweating even more, is still ripping up magazines in the face of Don's threats. "Try it, you little jackass," he says. I'm wondering where I can snag this American Pride livery for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020. Director Tom Holland manages to add drama to a more-or-less routine landing. 
> This place is utterly, totally deserted... You know, there's something wrong with the air here, Brian. 
It's occuring to me that this may be the worst script I've ever actually sat through reading. "This place smells wrong. Really badly wrong." Toomey threatens to sue the airline for $30 million for missing his 9AM meeting before seeing flashbacks to his abusive father (John Griesemer,) who mentions the Langoliers for the first time. The deserted airport scene is the reason I've written this whole thing - the dulled sounds of the characters' heels on the tarmac, the putrefied air. The clocks have stopped. The payphones are dead. The computers are lifeless. The *abadonedness* of it all. This is what the coronavirus has done to the world and to Craig Toomey. Even the battery-powered devices are dead. This is what confuses Stephen King Author Man to the point of head-rubbing and cigarette smoking for the first time in ten years.

The production was actually made at Bangor International Airport as [this incredible video] (https://youtu.be/D6McXLFsx-M) hosted by Toomey's actor explores.

It's never actually explained what The Langoliers are. Ken Tucker for *Entertainment Weekly* describes them as "[little meatballs](https://ew.com/article/1995/05/12/tv-movie-review-langoliers/)." The little Beatles-haired girl can hear them approaching. "It sounds a little like rice krispies after you pour the milk." Foodism abounds. "A really terrible, scary sound... Something making that horrible cereal noise." She screams that the cereal is going to kill them. Somehow, Toomey finds a revolver while he's losing his mind. Kimber Riddle the Stoner [went to NYU] (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0725760/). 
> Don't forget, Craiggy-weggy, the langoliers were here. And they will be back. 
Stephen King Author Man and Food Addict note that the food and soda have gone completely flat. "Tastes like old tire," says Don. "What we're dealing with is time, not dimension," says Stephen King. I'm wondering what in the hell sort of room they're in at the moment, and who decided those light wood countertops were *ever* a good idea. 
> The bottom line is, I believe, that we have hopped an absurdly short distance into the past, say as little as 15 minutes, and we're discovering the unlovely truth about time travel. That one can't appear in the Texas State School Book Depository on November 22nd, 1963 and hope to stop the Kennedy assassination. One can't witness the building of the pyramids or the sack of Rome, or investigate the age of the dinosaurs firsthand. No, fellow time travellers, have a look around you. This is the past. It's empty. It's silent. It's a world with all the meaning of a discarded old paint can. Sensory input has disappeared. Electricity has already disappeared. And time itself is winding down in a kind of a spiral that's going faster and faster. 
Little Prophet notes that the sound she's been hearing is once again getting louder. Mr. Toomey's face is shoved in the floor, his nose bent.

# The Matchsellers' Inheritance 
![The Matchsellers](https://i.snap.as/C7X1Eo2.png) 
## The duo's new album manages to be wonderfully explorative without sacrificing any sacred traditions. 
For years, I took the voices and culture of working Americans for granted and sought to generally distancemyself from my origin’s heritage as much as possible, but I’ve since realized that I couldn’t have done sowithout absolute certainty that country, bluegrass, and folk music were stubborn as State highway ditch-rooted fescue blades: omnipresent forces of Midwestern nature that’d secured their invincibility with thesimple superiority of their belonging. While this conclusion is true enough for the time being, it’s quiteindependently so of their worth or necessity. In such conditional blindness, I’ve simply proven mysensibilities to be (predictably in the case of my seniors) not exempt. This truth is noteworthy only becauseof its potential to spare others the embarrassment of blatant ignorance to their own privilege. That said, Iwould suggest that you engage this music sincerely for a moment for your own sake, regardless of your ownconvictions regarding country music, Indiana, plaid, pickup trucks, the end of the world, or the proper nounfor “cantaloupe.” 
As young adults, even those folks who’ve remained resolutely country-minded found themselves trivializingthe name of the titanic Dallas-born trio The Dixie Chicks not out of half-assed iconoclasm, but because their brand was so cleverly immune to irony. You thought you were proving yourself of a higher caliber ofdiscernment, but mocking goddesses only paraded your ignorance. In my teen rebellion against the cultureof my rural origin, I scoffed at their mention for a while, somehow oblivious to my blatant hypocrisy. Thanksto my older sisters and their automobiles, I spent before and after elementary school days absorbingthousands of hours’ worth of late-90s/early-oughts Pop Country radio. Two summers ago, I returned to thislibrary at length for the first time in 10 years and found my heart completely vulnerable to its relatedmemories and my mind consistently flabbergasted by the oomph of the composition that defines the genre’slast mainstream hurrah. 
The original three Chicks – Natalie Maines, Emily Robison, and Marty Maguire - are still very much alive,kicking, and radio-playing. They even “[returned from exile](https://www.tennessean.com/story/entertainment/music/2016/08/16/dixie-chicks-long-road-back­exile/88762752/)” with a real international tour in 2016. (I regret little more in my adult life than missing theopportunity to see them.) According to [a fascinating November 2015 analysis](https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/nov/19/the-dixie-chicks-tour-is-country-music-ready-to-forgive)in The Guardian, their 2003 denouncement of President George W. Bush cost them serious cred among theiraudience, but Johnny Cash likely [harbored similar sentiments](https://www.thenation.com/article/johnny­cash-was-not-republican), Stephen Morrissey is… [not straight](https://web.archive.org/web/20131024020237/http:/true-to-you.net/morrissey_news_131019_01), themost worthwhile current country sounds from my teenage home are [composed and performed by a transwoman](https://cowgirljordy.bandcamp.com/), and the staple tunes from the genre’s most chastepersonalities are often [just about sex](https://youtu.be/yCmsZUN4r_s). No reasonable individual would stillcite this incident in an argument opposing the essential legacy of these three miraculously talented women. 
From a pop perspective at least, The Dixie Chicks are almost certainly the penultimate expression of countrymusic as a technical and emotional exercise. Their extraordinary musicianship and prodigally antecedentmastery of suave sincerity represented the absolute peak of pop country’s untenable relationship with theAmerican working class in one hell of a 21st-century-breaching last hurrah that still brings tears of pride tomany an eye. However, the hysterical backlash of the greater working people personified in part by DonaldTrump’s presidency is a last sure indication of the mainstream’s final estrangement from all distillations ofrural culture. In the coming years, I fear the toiling masses will be left only with less and less authentic,more and more suburban bastardizations of their music as the last superficial delusions of condescendingaffection from the middle class fade, and the enterprise dies. What does survive will “graduate” (retire) toFolk (for white performers,) and further strengthen the Blues resurrection (for everyone else.) That said, it’shard to find anyone who’s comfortable mourning the loss openly after acceptance has progressively set in –there’s simply nowhere else to go, and its aging icons have been in desperate need of retirement throughout the Information Age. 
*The Top 10 Vegan Alternatives to Working-Class America* 
Even if I’d had the moderate exposure from my current perch in the midst of the notoriously grass-rootsnature of Portland’s Folk/Blues scene, 2000 miles west, I would have still been totally blindsided by myincidental introduction to The Matchsellers, two years ago. One needn’t harbor any presumptions about therelationship between Kansas City violinist/fiddler Julie Bates and Hoosier blues guitarist, Andrew Morris –they’re just about the cutest pair you’ll ever see, couple’s act or not (it’s less relevant than you’d think, andnone of our business.) They’re also extremely talented and genuinely authoritative world-class musicianswith plenty of authentic country mileage who exude a proud air of warm, confident serenity occupying thebluegrass sphere. After happening upon their set at Columbia’s faux-speakeasy in Summer 2016, I was atonce charmed and impressed by the pervasive magnitude of the ethereal aura that followed them, especiallyafter our brief post-performance conversation. I’m ninety percent sure they came without a mobile phonebetween them carrying a wicker basket full of CDs and matchbooks, and shucks… I do believe we’ve beendoing this whole thing wrong, all along.

I bought a copy of [Kosciusko County](https://thematchsellers.bandcamp.com/album/kosciusko-county) thenand there and played the shit out of it the next summer, wandering aimlessly around Missouri with my bestfriend, revisiting (and occasionally disrupting) the resolute peace of the tiny communities I grew up orbiting.On our way to the Hannibal – Huckleberry’s Fictional home/the great Mississippi’s tired tourism machine –we just left it on repeat. As a soundtrack to such sentimental pursuits, a central trio of back-to-back tracksproved especially potent, beginning with “[Mentone (The 3,000 lb Egg)](https://thematchsellers.bandcamp.com/track/mentone-the-3000-lb-egg)” - the work’s nostalgic, tear-jerkingsole instrumental. Production isn’t low-fidelity, but appropriately honest – no amount of expensive masteringwould be capable of compressing the essence of a surprise late-night live performance from TheMatchsellers’ work into a digital audio file, anyway. 
Bates’ fiddling is an impossibly rare pleasure – the real type of sawing that mystically manages to erase one’sinhibitions and sense of civic responsibility when tearing about the borders of quiet row-crop plots, leavinglong-lived lesions of billowing limestone high above numbered county roads at ninety miles-per-hour.Succeeding the distant, eye-misting cruise of the 1.5-ton Egg, “[Driving Escort](https://thematchsellers.bandcamp.com/track/driving-escort)” is a masterpiece (naturally) of this raucousrealm. 
*Driving down the road with a yellow light on top of my truck / Going down to Vincennes earning my sixtybucks.* 
Add the accompaniment of Morris’ obviously-fathomless relationship with the guitar, and the result nails aselect truth without any hint of prudishness. At sufficient volume, “[Muskmelon Breakdown](https://thematchsellers.bandcamp.com/track/muskmelon-breakdown)” becomes a beautifully-harmoniouscatalyst of fast, loose, maniacal, hilarious energy that’s sure to land you in a ditch, but you’ll still be laughingyour ass off by the time you’re pulling clay clumps and waist-high fescue blades from your steaming radiator.*Kosciusko County* isn’t an innovative record by any critical instrumentation, but I’d do best to keep mysun-faded, skip-worn copy readily at hand for the next time I find myself on a fresh gravel road, wheneverthat may be. 
<iframe width="auto" height="auto" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Fjzto2ZZ8zU?controls=0"frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"allowfullscreen></iframe> > For the last five years, all we said was goodbye> I said it again, it was the fifth time> > I took your word and did what I thought was best> I took your word and went 600 miles west 
That’s it, then – we’ve got The Matchsellers pretty well figured for either wannabe(?) or reformed(?) yahoosof their own design; charming, dusty novelties who chose a folly destiny of toiling their craft for none but aseasonal dozen acres of white, sweating State Fair flesh. Obviously, they’re meant for us sophisticated,globetrotting Winners to collect like thrift store antiques on our way down the interstate. Their time is oursto book for nothing on our mediocre “speakeasy’s” waxy new stage; to post on an Instagram story, to Tweetin an easy compartmentalization of their quaint displacement from our time, deep in the dusty recesses ofour collections for no good bargain, where they’ll fall comfortably in line as our predictable and willingcountry servants should an opportunity happen upon us to show a stranger how interesting, dynamic, andworldly we are. 
As a displaced (and formerly ex-communicated) yokel, I’ve often been astonished by how easy it is todiscard American folk music for huge swaths of time unless it expresses some unignorable sort ofspectacular torment. My own failure to recognize the value in this one until I became separated andhomesick was an overtly foolhardy cliché (though quite predictable of like privilege,) but I can’t help butwonder: **is it unavoidable?** Of course, the process is necessary for ‘class justice’ – one might even call ita natural law of sorts – and in the case of The Matchsellers, there’s hardly a struggle to communicateemotionally. For a real music scholar, though, it’s surely worth asking of those voices who know: do theoppressed, destitute, and hope-impoverished people of this country still rely on bluegrass, or has it beenreplaced for them? 
The abstraction of the phrase “good surprise” had plummeted from our collective vocabulary at a record-demolishing velocity in the interim, but this past spring’s release of [*Bluegrastronauts*](https://thematchsellers.bandcamp.com/album/bluegrastronauts) hit me squarely upside the skull again,stirring a solid half hour of hysterical, shrieking psychosis. I assumed the worst… *Dear God, what has theinternet forced upon that sweet, rootsy duo*?! – and was immediately compelled to drop everything andlisten. 
<iframe style="border: 0; width: 350px; height: 470px;"src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=3499187895/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=00006b/tracklist=false/transparent=true/" seamless><ahref="http://thematchsellers.bandcamp.com/album/bluegrastronauts">Bluegrastronauts by TheMatchsellers</a></iframe> 
*Hoosiers, we have a problem*. What the fuck is this album, exactly? A nonchalant, apparently obliviouschallenge to every assumption you could possibly arrive with. It’s safe to suppose “Bluegrastronauts” refersto its departure from the rest of their discography – from smack dab in Indiana’s center to the goddamnedBeta Quadrant, the two managed to stupefyingly ace a theme most comfortable residents of their bluegrasssphere would take care to avoid leaving up on the kitchen whiteboard – even tackling apocalypse with regalserenity. At first glance, I was sure that copious soft glow had to either be the false product of my owninsanity, or a deliberate attempt to alienate the sum of their audience in a single crises of identity. In fact,The Matchsellers had pulled off yet another especially-sparse artistic miracle and harnessed their creativerestlessness to propel their departure from the elderly genre’s pretensions without spilling a single drip oftheir secret sauce. It’s not a concept album (thank God,) but doesn’t wander in any disparaging sense,either. 
> Earl Scruggs in a spaceship on his way to Mars> Pickin' away on the banjo at 100,000 miles an hour> Bill Monroe in a rocket, see the look on his face> it's mighty dark to travel when you're in outer space 
Name-dropping four bluegrass legends within the number 1 album-titled introductory track is the pair’s single self-conscious acknowledgment of visiting folk fanatics: this CD looks crazy, but we know what we’re doing –and Kansas City’s mention accredits the locale of the following entirely Missouri-made production. Indeed, inthe WhoDoneIts, you’ll see The HillBenders’ [Chad Graves](https://www.instagram.com/p/Bfwh-rmhcet/)layed em’ down in Springfield, and Johnny Kenepaske’s [Dead Horse Sound Company](https://deadhorsesoundcompany.com/) spread em’ around in the Heart of America, itself. Missourianmusicians especially should take note of these names: the offerings may have diversified since my day, butsound talent like this is difficult to come across, even within explosive college towns. Cutting two liveacoustic tracks per performer – four in total – while expecting to retain any subsequent control over thebehavior of either unwanted or subject sound is as difficult as any other circumstance you’ll encounter instudio production at this level. I know this much (but little more in that direction): real sound control issimply too tedious to bear for monomiking rascals with GarageBand. Now, having lost or been estrangedfrom any remotely-professional sound reproduction equipment, *Bluegrastronauts* sounds as balanced andpolished as my wired Apple earbuds could ever convey. 
In shared verses, Julie and Andrew’s charmed harmonies are separated beautifully about the listener withoutinducing a sense of lateral imbalance when one of them sings alone. (Admittedly, I don’t exactly know howit’s accomplished.) No single personality in the record’s toolset – guitar, fiddle, banjo, bass, or dobro stepsover any other. 
I have no idea who’s listening, but I’m positive their numbers should be multiplying by a hundredfold veryquickly, filling especially with all of ye who feel abandoned by all authentic American representation. Theyshouldn’t ever fill up stadiums or establishment radiowaves, nor should their art invite extensive pretentiousdissection, but they will be adored. 
It’s a quintessential manner of Country Boy pride to whip the middle class’s condescension right back aroundwith a classic demonstration: Oh, you thought I didn’t know about that? You thought I couldn’t *do* that?Well, of course I can! I’m just not particularly interested. The Matchsellers, though, have attained a muchhigher tier of comfort and confidence in their own skin.

# The Social Dilemma's Dilemma 
![The Social Dilemma - The Founders on Their iPhones](https://i.snap.as/5X1uFAi.jpg) 
## The pop culture discussion of tech's greater issues missed in (at least) two major ways. 
For those of us who've written about technology, generally, for quite a long time, any injection of thebroader metaphysical/"ethical" conversation regarding the impact the industry has had/is having/is expectedto have on our species into popular culture is inevitably an emotional event. *The Social Network* had analmost comical disregard for any potential function as a substantial critique of its subjects. Not that it'sparticularly supportive of that argument, but Mark Fuck, himself, recently [said in court](https://www.businessinsider.com/mark-zuckerberg-mentions-the-social-network-during-testimony-2018-4),essentially, that he didn't know what the movie was about. I'm not particularly sure, either. I suppose thedramatic film industry has no particular obligation to be critical of *the times*, but *documentaries* certainlyshould, in my estimation, and *The Social Dilemma* could've done better, in that regard. 
First, the **actively misleading**: As thoroughly as I enjoyed Peter Campbell's casting as the master-manipulating triplets behind the dramatized young man's screen, the film's depiction of this very humaninvasion of privacy is *blatantly false* imagery. The Privacy Problem is *not* that Facebook or Googleemployees are directly and actively viewing and manipulating your use of their services in real time. In fact,it is *ridiculously* unlikely that human eyes will ever see your individualized information. One could go so faras to describe the whole film as "ridiculous," as did one of my favs, [Casey Newton](https://www.theverge.com/interface/2020/9/16/21437942/social-dilemma-netflix-review-orlowski-sarah­zhang-memo-facebook-buzzfeed): 
> The dramatized segments include a fictional trio of sociopaths working inside an unnamed social networkto design bespoke push notifications to distract their users. They show an anguished family struggling to getthe children to put their phones away during dinner. And the ominous piano score that pervades everyscene, rather than ratcheting up the tension, gives it all the feeling of camp. 
[*The Verge*'s official review of the film](https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/4/21419993/the-social­dilemma-jeff-orlowski-netflix-movie-review-social-media-algorithms) - written by Adi Robinson and as citedby Casey - is an important read, as well. Robinson makes use of some very intelligent language and citessome very interesting bits (including a Wikipedia article about a series of Hogarth paintings?) for *TheVerge*'s audience, who already knew all of this. What I hoped to do by writing about this at all was speak tothose distinctly *separate* tech media - grandmothers, retirees, etc. - who are both directly affected by thesubjects covered by *The Social Dilemma* and particularly susceptible to its delusions about "privacy" - aterm which I would argue is not particularly relevant to the conversation. Personally, I define my privacy in away that is not violated by the simple **collection** of "my data," regardless of how detailed said collectionmay or may not be, but would be by individual **examination** with human eyes, which - while possible - isextremely unlikely if for no other reason than a lack of business incentive. While Google may have access tothe data it would need to determine whether I am currently showering or not, there is absolutely zeromonetary gain to be had in one of its employees (or outsourced contractors) knowing this. 
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">you don&#39;t have to careabout reforming privacy, intellectual property, or any of the other issues an alternative addresses - you needonly to want a better and/or different experience.</p>&mdash; David Blue (@NeoYokel) <ahref="https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/1283173322822488064?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 14,2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script> 
Now, on to the **notably missing**: Perhaps most important to note before I go on is that the film wasproduced by - and directly promotes on several occasions - one particular organization, called the [*Centerfor Humane Technology*](https://www.humanetech.com/), which notably has a .com rather than a .orgdomain... hm. Immediately after watching the film, I complied with its direction to its website, where I wasspecifically looking for "solutions" to the issues it presented. Aside from Wikipedia (sortof,) it neglected to mention the abundance of alternative organizations and projects who've been building against the adtech­funded web for ages - some for decades. Unfortunately, neither the organization's website nor the film'swebpage list any of these alternatives, whatsoever, which personally leads me to believe **the whole thingis bullshit**, for lack of a better term. 
![The Social Dilemma Newsletter Prompt](https://i.snap.as/6k9MzeE.png) 
The film essentially argues for a single choice: using social media and other adtech-sustained services, or*not* using them. What I'm here to tell you: **you have a choice of services**. For every single individualservice criticized in the film, I guarantee there exists at least a handful of alternatives across a spectrum ofsin. If you've followed my work for any length of time (you probably shouldn't still be reading,) you knowI've advocated exhaustively for [Mastodon](https://joinmastodon.org/) - the open web, decentralized socialnetwork outpacing Twitter in every single way. Two years ago, I spent [an entire summer](https://bilge.world/bandcamp-streaming-music) arguing that Bandcamp is the only music streaming servicewho's business model benefits both platform and artist. I'm still finishing up [a massive essay that discussesalternatives to Facebook](https://www.notion.so/rotund/David-Blue-vs-Big-Blue­9d82a679c93a41d78c6736e8a61e30e0), which has been an exhausting but educational journey, as you canprobably imagine, namely that leaving a platform as all-consuming as Facebook for an open-source and/orfederated alternative requires a certain amount of bravery. Essentially, the evidence suggests that the*alternatives* discussion is a particularly important one to me, as is finding a way to evangelize it that isn'timmediately off-putting to "the average person." 
<iframe width="100%" height="265" src="https://clyp.it/oxpup2vm/widget" frameborder="0"></iframe> 
Poke around the film's official website a bit and you'll discover a variety of heavily-branded "resources" for"taking action," all awash with a certain irony, including [a fucking Bingo game](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1juAZCcmRpNNjXajXnm0KOS-9fFUhPI3q/view) (hosted on Google Drive, noless,) which the site *actually* suggests you post on your Instagram story! Also under the "Take Action"vertical are links to Moment CEO Tim Kendall's [tips for reducing your screen time](https://www.thesocialdilemma.com/reclaim-your-screen-time/), the "[Data Detox Kit](https://datadetoxkit.org/en/home/)," which advocates for Firefox as the private browsing solution (amongan indigestibly huge link tree,) a "Join Now" button, and - most ironic of all - a link to download the "[AdObserver plugin](https://adobserver.org/)," in order to "share with researchers the ads you see on socialmedia as they work to expose micro-targeting techniques & hold political advertisers accountable." In otherwords, the very same data collection the film condemns, albeit for the "Online Political Transparency Project"instead of the greater adtech monstrosity. 
![The Social Dilemma Bingo](https://i.snap.as/gf22b9R.png) 
No, it's not a scam. Using *The Markup*'s shiny new [Blacklight tool](https://themarkup.org/blacklight), Ifound thesocialdilemma.com to be entirely free of any malicious tracking aside from the inevitableaccompaniment to their Google Drive embeds. (Here's [the report in full](https://s3.us-west­2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/893e4684-462b-4548-92ad-b85f240d0e85/report.html?X-Amz­Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=AKIAT73L2G45O3KS52Y5%2F20201001%2Fus-west­2%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20201001T204417Z&X-Amz-Expires=86400&X-Amz­Signature=98001ad78557d11b12dda1347cb193c252f54a81b00547970717080c06bf04eb&X-Amz­SignedHeaders=host&response-content-disposition=filename%20%3D%22report.html%22).) All at once, wecan be virtually certain there is no *malice* in this particular destination, at least, which leaves...incompetence? I'm afraid so. It is not revolutionary to suppose that the people who conceived of theseruthlessly effective systems of adtech and figure out how to implement them in the real world - regardless ofwhat they believe now, or then - that these folks should not be our first call when we're searching for"solutions." You know this, they know it, and they *explicitly acknowledged it* at least twice in the film,itself, and yet the fact of it remains. 
Would you care to guess what [Chapter 1](https://datadetoxkit.org/en/privacy/essentials/#step-1) of the[*Digital Detox Kit*](https://datadetoxkit.org/) is about? I can't imagine you'd be correct... Under theheading "CONTROL YOUR SMARTPHONE DATA," step 1 is literally just *renaming your phone*: > At some point, you may have “named” your phone for *Wi-Fi, Bluetooth* or both – or maybe the namewas automatically generated during setup.> > This means that *“Alex Chung’s Phone”* is what’s visible to the Wi-Fi network owner and, if yourBluetooth is turned on, to everyone in the area who has their Bluetooth on as well.> > You wouldn't announce your name as you enter a café, restaurant, or airport, so neither should yourphone. 
Now, I've always considered the ability to change a computer's name an immense privilege. My first "real"computer's name was Clementine, then there was Bertha, two Sophies (probably my favorite traditionallyfemale name, so I excuse myself,) Silas, Linus, Uel, Jehoshaphat, Temba, Knot, and now Hildur. My iPhone 8Plus' name is Gravel. However, I realize that most users could care less, and I think that's completelyrational. Technically, suggesting you change your phone's common name to that of "your favorite televisioncharacter" ([Hildur Odegard](https://fortitude.fandom.com/wiki/Hildur_Odegard) is my favorite character in*Fortitude*, so...) is *not* bad advice, even within its own privacy-centered argument, it's just that it's*ridiculously* low priority (or should be) compared with doing just about anything else along this vein. Aconundrum is presented: I cannot imagine these people sitting down and seriously jotting down "changedevice name" as step 1 in their strategy, but I also cannot fathom an incentive for them to expend sucheffort facetiously or maliciously. Again, incompetence/ignorance is the only remaining explanation. 
![Firefox for iOS Notification](https://i.snap.as/sEa9ojU.jpeg)*A notification I received while literally typing this out.* 
I have to backtrack, now, and confess that I *did* find an "[Alternative Apps Centre](https://datadetoxkit.org/en/alternative-app-centre/)" within the Data Detox Kit, which contains somegenuinely smart recommendations like ProtonMail, Riot, Signal, and DuckDuckGo surrounding a bunch ofprivacy-enhancing browser extensions. However, the "detox" seems to have been lost at some point alongthe way. No amount of privacy (yes, I do think it's hilarious that I can freely refer to "privacy" as acommodity with a positive quantity) can detoxify one' social media addiction. The savvy reader notes the"Supported by Mozilla Firefox" badges all over the website and asks me "well, what did you expect?" Myanswer: something "more" than promotion, I suppose. 
I suspect this is another case of *don't go to those who created the problem for the solution*. *Moreprivacy* is a more tangible vector upon which to "innovate" than simply *putting down the fucking phone*,but the interviewees in the film at least touched upon a very important insight in that regard: **turn off allyour notifications**. I genuinely believe turning off *all* notifications is a good way to proceed, especially ifthis film (or anything else, for that matter) has made you feel uncomfortable about your relationship withyour phone. I realized that I'd somehow allowed YouTube to clutter my notifications unconsciously for*years*, which is disturbing. In general, the apps who's notifications I'd probably value the most(Bandcamp!) are the ones who use the feature the least/the most subtly. 
Leaving your phone in a different room while you sleep is a good idea, though it seems a bit excessive whenyou could just **turn it off**, instead. (Displaced from your bed or stone dead, your chances of making useof your handset in an emergency are about the same, I'd wager.) I suspect it's long overdue for a reboot,anyway. As far as "**Email Addiction**" goes, I suggest you first take an afternoon to go through yourinbox and make use of GDPR's greatest gift: the single-click opt-out, most often found in very small text in agiven email's footer. If you're *really* serious, unsubscribe from even the newsletters you *do* read andmake yourself resubscribe to them. Make use of your preferred email platform's archives feature - or don't ­but clear everything from your inbox itself. Mark it all as read. Then, you'll be ready to seek out other *EmailWellness* methodologies like the recently-trendy *Inbox Zero*. 
If quitting social media cold turkey is not viable in your personal or professional life, **a set daily time** tocheck your notifications is a very good start. Yes, it's okay to announce on Facebook that you're taking abreak from Facebook. There *is* a very good reason: accountability, to both yourself and your friends. Ifyou are interested in the alternatives I mentioned before, genuinely **contact me literally any time**. My personal phone number is **(573) 823-4380**. I would be elated to discuss some of the services I'vediscovered with you. 
My own advice on "privacy:" don't worry about installing browser extensions, or using a different browser forthat matter. Aside from a password manager, there is no need to download or install any additional softwareto protect your information. All the "privacy tools" you need are already present on your device, and theymostly consist of geolocation settings. If you're an iOS user, you've already been confronted with them in thepast few months. If you are still genuinely bothered by automated data collection unseen by human eyes,your only next step - if we're really honest with ourselves - is figuring out how you're going to go without theinternet. Untracked browsing is no longer a realistic option.

Considering my use of Git as a means to track revisions on my own writing, it's important to note that you should feel free to replace all instances of "software" in the statement below with "words," "writing," "expression," etc. 
While I appreciate tremendously the work and contribution of [Arlo Bendiken](https://ar.to/2010/01/set-your-code-free) in the form of The Unlicense, I would like to add that I see no need, personally, to make the refutation of Intellectual Property law regarding my own work into some profound ethical statement. As it stands, I have not to my knowledge been the victim of any sort of theft of any kind, and find the suggestion highly unlikely. If I *am* made aware of such a case, there is certainly a possibility that I may change my mind on this issue, so I suppose I should highlight that **THESE TERMS ARE SUBJECT TO CHANGE**, though I suspect I would be more flattered and/or amused than actually offended. 
I would also like to annotate that my use of this license should not be regarded as a suggestion that anyone else follow my example, or that I "believe in" taking such action regarding one's work, generally. While I did indeed take the time to set up [a repository](https://github.com/extratone/eoi) of John Perry Barlow's "[The Economy of Ideas] (https://www.wired.com/1994/03/economy-ideas/)" in a bunch of different document formats, I do not necessarily agree with all of what he argued, especially in the context of the world 27 years later. If you *are* particularly interested in my opinion on the matter for whatever reason, here is what I have to say to you: 
The principled beginning of The Open Web was a great moment in history, but - like all historical principles - it is extremely important that we consider *context* and maintain an appropriate level of criticism when looking back on old manifestos written by old white guys. In general, try your best to *be reasonable*.

# Three Billboards Outside Silva, North Carolina 
![Three Billboards](https://i.snap.as/C271IoF.jpeg) 
## Nitpicking the recklessness of last year’s highly-awarded, class-blind black comedy 
Indeed, it may be the time to jab at the rural, working-class South, but Martin McDonagh [claims](http://www.slashfilm.com/martin-mcdonagh-interview/) to have written his Golden Orb Special “eight yearsago,” long before Tump, and any critical resolution the film provides is argued haphazardly. Consequently, itseye is cast on this strange, satirical portrayal of the Midwest in a manner which is inaccurate and insensitiveenough to irk this Missourian. When I saw it at Columbia’s Ragtag Cinema this week, it was introduced by ayoung employee who noted that 1) Ebbing, Missouri is not a real place, 2) the film was actually shot in oneof the Carolinas (an audience member suggested incorrectly that it was in SC,) and 3) we should prepareourselves to be roused a bit by a bar scene in which a character pays $8 for two beers because “that justwouldn’t happen” (the Ragtag also serves alcohol.) 
The “redemption arc” of the racist “hick” “loser” Officer Dixon (Sam Rockwell) was rightfully [at the center](https://www.vox.com/2018/1/19/16878018/three-billboards-controversy-racist-sam-rockwell-redemption­
flannery-oconnor) of the film’s controversy, but even if one imagines his role and fate written differently —perhaps with him irrecoverably shunned and/or visibly punished for his excessive, hateful violence — hisrubishness would still be unforgivable. Living with his mother and turtle feels like an effort to humanize him
— and, by extension, racist small-town cops as a whole. *The Huffington Post*’s [Zeba Blay](https://twitter.com/zblay) wrote an essential take on why *Three Billboards* — with its terrifyingly racistdork — was received the way it was. 
> Rockwell’s character is the racist uncle whom white liberals fear and love. The ability to feel for him - to
root for him in spite of his past transgressions, because he really is a “good man at heart,” an idiot who
doesn’t know any better - offers a kind of catharsis for the white viewer who can’t or won’t deal with true
nuance, who is unable to reconcile their own complicity with their desire to be “good.” 
It’s not as if the film isn’t technically well executed or refreshing — thanks in large part, yes, to FrancesMcDormand — or that I will not regret appealing on behalf of my home state, but it’s hard not to speak upwhen Hollywood shits so recklessly on my people. I don’t much like writing about movies because there areso many voices who consistently speak so much more effectively. NPR’s *Pop Culture Happy Hour*, for
instance, did a wonderful job [dissecting](https://www.npr.org/sections/monkeysee/2017/12/01/567291457/pop-culture-happy-hour-revenge­redemption-and-three-billboards) the film’s depictions of racism and domestic violence. [Gene Demby](https://twitter.com/GeeDee215) commented that “[McDonagh] doesn’t get these particular physics ofAmerican racism, and he’s not interested in them,” and I think it’s reasonable to suggest that Mark’s not veryversed or interested in the physics of American class, either. 
If you must differentiate the state of Missouri as a cultural whole between North and South, it is currently
more red than blue — we went [56% for Donald and 38% for Hillary](http://enrarchives.sos.mo.gov/enrnet/)
— but ask anyone from “somewhere down in the Georgia, Florida, Alabama corner” — as McDonagh put it ­
where we generally fall, and they’d be unlikely to regard us, fraternally, as the same part of the country. The
accents in *Three Billboards* are not among the wide variety of local dialects you’ll encounter anywhere in
the state, but perhaps they wouldn’t be out of place in Sylva, North Carolina, where the film was [actuallyshot](http://wlos.com/news/local/big-movie-comes-to-sylva-shooting-dates-for-three-billboards). 
Regardless of all potential criticism of the film’s cultural perspective or technical excellence — and I think mostof it is more valid than any take I could possibly offer — my particular issue with it comes from a culmination
of tasteless decisions. If one reasonably successful Irish director were to produce a patronizing film at theexpense of Missouri’s working class filled with a ton of absurd, misconstrued characters portrayed by A-list
talent *on location* in a real Missouri town, the side-effectual economic benefits such a production deliversto a locale would make it all more forgivable. *Say what you want about us… as long as you’re paying*. Butto photograph such a film completely separate Missouri — culturally and financially — set in a fictional(ized) town, *include the state’s name in its title*, before conducting oneself in interviews as if we were a randomtarget on a “Southern” dartboard… Well, that’s awfully shitty. 
*Boy, working class Americans sure are a riot!* 
The writing is interesting enough for this, totally-out-of-touch“reviewer,” but I can’t imagine why it won BestScreenplay at the Globes, unless the other nominees were completely, bleakly predictable. (I wouldn’t
know.) The excerpt below (**<u>SPOILER WARNING I GUESS? LOL</u>**) was the most stirring part of
the experience, personally, if only because I really like films that palm strike one in the face without warning
with bizarre, chaotic vulgarity (like the elevator scene in *Drive*.) 
I suppose it could have been the result of a rational decision to give *any* depth to Anne (Abbie Cornish) —who is Chief Willoughby’s (Woody Fucking Harrelson) Australian?, much-too-attractive wife — before he kills
himself in the last third of the movie, making her suddenly relevant. Or, perhaps it was another attempt to
emphasize the emotional repression of “Southern” folks — one of the almost-accurate positives of the film, if
only thanks to McDormand’s skill. She and Sam Rockwell won Best Actress and Best Actor in a Supporting
Role, respectively, which makes sense — it’s a shame they accepted such an out-of-touch work with which to
demonstrate their ability to assume aloof, emotionally-dysfunctional characters. 
Growing up astride classe while traveling throughout the vast majority of Missouri for various reasons has
made me defensive, and — while my right to speak for hard-working Midwesterners is certainly debatable -I’d
suggest the industry at large be more diligently interested when setting is especially emphasized. It is no
longer acceptable to pass up the opportunities McDonagh has for critical storytelling in *Three Billboards*.
Racist cops, abusive spouses, unsolved murders, and mishandled grief are real, abundant issues in the
country’s breadbasket, and they’re worth discussing responsibly — especially with such a powerful platform. If
the purpose of film writing is to help an audience determine whether or not a work is worth spending their
time and money to see it in theaters or otherwise, I can tell you — even within my bias and limited authority ­that this one just… isn’t.

# Tweetbot 5 for iOS Review 
![Tweetbot 5 for iOS](https://i.snap.as/g5G5uUb.jpeg) 
On Win­dows XP bal­lot day, I spent *my* beat­nik-ass time mar­veling at the (seem­ing­ly) abrupt avail­abil­i­ty ofsome gen­uine­ly inno­v­a­tive social apps on the Apple App Store for the first time since iOS 7(?) Of course, Iam aware that rea­son­able peo­ple would regard a “sneak peek,” NDA-vio­lat­ing, per­fect­ly Adobe Pre­mieredapp review to be pret­ty fuck­ing lame, and I won’t dis­pute any accu­sa­tions to the tune of “just an insanewhite guy with a Word­Press site,” but I still believe it’s impor­tant to talk about soft­ware *espe­cial­ly* becausevir­tu­al­ly every­one uses it (as opposed to qui­et­ing down just when these apps and the peo­ple who makethem attain the most advan­ta­geous pos­si­ble posi­tion to fuck the whole world.) 
That said, I’m going to keep this as brief and unre­vi­sion­ist as I can: Tweetbot’s [lat­est iter­a­tion](https://9to5mac.com/2018/10/18/tweetbot-true-dark-mode-gifs/) may actu­al­ly jus­ti­fy the [ded­i­cat­ed sub-­red­dit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Tweetbot/) I’ve just dis­cov­ered! (Reddit’s the last place any­one wants totalk about apps, I guess.) I’ve com­plained at length about Twitter’s increas­ing­ly hos­tile (but [jus­ti­fied, sortof](https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/25/17274828/twitter-earning-q1-2018-profit-user-growth)) treat­ment ofits once [aston­ish­ing­ly diverse land­scape of third-par­ty clients and tools](https://mashable.com/2009/05/02/twitter-iphone-apps/#S_O.z..2mqqJ), yet I’d hon­est­ly grown sig­nif­i­cant­lyin accept­ing that the dynam­ic would nev­er again see the pow­er of the world’s most cash-stuffed com­pa­niesdeliv­ered into the sweaty hands of small, kooky one and two-man teams, and it *nev­er* would’ve occurredto me that Tweet­bot was still around — much less get­ting ready to update its trusty old app with a releasethat would sud­den­ly make it clear­ly more sta­ble *and* bet­ter-look­ing than its last com­peti­tor: [the NativeFuck, itself](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/twitter/id333903271?mt=8), which has also under­gone [sig­nif­i-­cant cos­met­ic surgery](https://www.searchenginejournal.com/twitter-redesigns-ios-app-for-one-handed­scrolling/276541/), recent­ly. Name­ly, they moved the *one fuck­ing but­ton* that’s giv­en the app a usabil­i­typre­mi­um over its mobile web-based low-rent clone. 
“The com­pose but­ton has been moved to the bot­tom right-hand cor­ner and “floats” as users scroll downtheir time­line. That means the but­ton is always avail­able to quick­ly send a tweet when the mood strikes.” 
Yeah okay, *Matt*. 
>We’ve got a shiny, new com­pose but­ton to unveil on Twit­ter for iOS! Eas­i­er than ever to use, the float­ingicon is promi­nent­ly dis­played and per­fect for one-hand­ed scrolling and Tweet com­pos­ing.

Twit­ter Sup­port is no [@Cher](http://twitter.com/cher), yeah, but it seems strange that less than a thou­sandof Twitter’s [more than 300 mil­lion month­ly users](http://bilge.world/media/birdearn.pdf) would both­er toengage with the announce­ment of a sig­nif­i­cant fun­da­men­tal change to its infra­struc­ture. Imag­ine if the fed-­er­al gov­ern­ment announced via White House press con­fer­ence that every stop­light in the Unit­ed States wasgoing to have its yel­low light removed to “stream­line work­flow” with­out any fur­ther expla­na­tion, yet only1000 *total* Amer­i­cans even both­ered to tune in to the tele­vi­sion cov­er­age across all the news net­works.It’d be strange, yeah? Well, y’all are using Twit­ter more than you’re dri­ving, I’ll bet. Next time, **get outand** [vote on my Twit­ter poll](https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/1062859883211620352), you fascist! 
In my Twit­ter glo­ry days — that is, when I used to spend the entire­ty of every one of my com­mu­ni­ty col­legeclass­es Tweet­ing from my phone — there was a healthy offer­ing of third-par­ty clients on both mobile anddesk­top that filled the eng­lish of the era’s soft­ware media with an absolute­ly bar­bar­ic brand-beat­en pile oflin­guis­tic Twit­trash. After Twin­kle — one of the [ear­li­est and ugli­est](https://www.macrumors.com/2008/07/17/twinkle-another-twitter-client-in-app-store/) ways to use Twit­terever — you’d have to choose between Twit­pic, Tweet­deck, Twit­ter­counter, Twit­ter­feed, Twhirl, Twit­turly,Twt­poll, Retweet­ist, Tweepler, Hel­lotxt, Twit­dom, Tweetscan, Tweet­burn­er, Tweet­vi­sor, Twit­ter­vi­sion, Twibs,Twistori, and Twit­bin. These are just a few I picked up from a [10-year-old](https://techcrunch.com/2009/02/19/the-top-20-twitter-applications/) [*TechCrunch*] (https://techcrunch.com/2009/02/19/the-top-20-twitter-applications/) [report](https://techcrunch.com/2009/02/19/the-top-20-twitter-applications/) list­ing the top 21 Twit­ter appli­ca­tionsby traf­fic. 
### ***Twibs*** 
Now, I have to stop myself from dig­ging too deep here and attempt­ing some­thing absurd like *The His­to­ryof Twit­ter Clients*, but the fuck­ing mate­r­i­al is there! I could spend an entire after­noon going throughYouTube search­es and gad­get blogs because it brings me back to that time when I lived every day assum­ingthese things were going to con­tin­ue to aston­ish for my entire adult­hood. So many incred­i­ble ideas! *How­ev-­er,* I’m going to save them for lat­er and focus on the cream of the crop, so to speak: **Twit­terif­ic** and**Tweet­bot**, which has been a long­time favorite of mine. As I said, it was in com­mu­ni­ty col­lege that I firstponied up mon­ey for Tweet­bot 3 on my iPhone 4S sim­ply because the hype over it among app and gad­getnerds was *so bonkers* that it man­aged to spill over into my life, despite the fact that iOS7 and I were hav-­ing seri­ous issues in our mar­riage. 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DE1YHcoPxMk 
If you trust Mark Wat­son with your life as I do, you’d bet­ter believe that Tweet­bot has been “[a scream­er](https://youtu.be/DE1YHcoPxMk)” since its very begin­ning, when it pio­neered the *Pre­mi­um Poweruser*seg­ment, for which a demo­graph­ic appar­ent­ly still exists. It was *fast*, yet always notice­ably smoother thanthe native app, just as the newest release is today. I must point out, though, that the blog­gers and YouTu-­bers who’ve insist­ed that Tweet­bot or Twit­ter­rif­ic or any oth­er pre­mi­um app could replace the native Twit­terapp entire­ly on iPhone even before they were stripped of a most live/push func­tion­al­i­ty (which I’ll come backaround to in just a moment,) are undoubt­ed­ly lying to them­selves — as good as they got, they nev­er over-­took Twitter’s own app in imme­di­a­cy terms, which is almost inevitably going to present fun­da­men­tal deter-­rence on the part of the active Twit­ter user who intends to rid them­selves of the default pedes­tri­an avenueof admin­is­tra­tion. Tweet­bot solved a lot of things, it real­ly is *daft* when it comes to noti­fi­ca­tions. Itwouldn’t be the end of the world if they came a few hun­dred sec­onds late — it’s that they’re nev­er pre-­dictably or con­sis­tent­ly so, which sev­ers entire­ly the human per­cep­tion of engaged *plugged-in-ness*, if youwill. It’s the same phe­nom­e­na Chuck Kloster­man explores best in the con­text of DVRing live sports to watchlat­er. 
>It’s dif­fi­cult to project fic­tion­al sce­nar­ios that are more oblique and unex­pect­ed than the cra­zi­est momentsfrom real­i­ty. We all under­stand this. And that under­stand­ing is at the core of the human attrac­tion to live-­ness. We don’t crave live sport­ing events because we need imme­di­a­cy; we crave them because they rep­re-­sent those (increas­ing­ly rare) cir­cum­stances in which the entire spec­trum of pos­si­bil­i­ty is in play.>-“[Space, Time, and DVR Mechan­ics](http://grantland.com/features/space-time-dvr-mechanics)” by ChuckKloster­man 
Tweet­bot is unques­tion­ably a more thor­ough envi­ron­ment in which to explore Twit­ter than any oth­er thirdpar­ty client, but it can’t do the live thing. (Please do com­plain to Twit­ter, Inc. about the API sit­u­a­tion ifyou’re so inclined, though.) All I’m try­ing to say is, **there is no fuck­ing rea­son you’d delete the Twit­terapp** — hide it away in a fold­er and nev­er ever open it again if it dis­gusts you so, but leave its noti­fi­ca­tionsset­tings on so that it can keep itself busy in there. Now *that* is a smart work­flow! In fact, it was mine! Andit did work for such a long time that you’d prob­a­bly for­get about the arrange­ment in no time were there notthe occa­sion­al obvi­ous dis­crep­an­cies between Tweetbot’s Mention’s tab and the native app’s instant noti­fi­ca-­tions. There has nev­er been — nor will there be, I think — a client for Twit­ter that can replace *some* useof its own prop­er­ties. 
I think Tweet­bot 3 *made* me into my own ridicu­lous equiv­a­lent of a “poweruser.” Things are a lit­tle hazynow, but I know that I depart­ed my main Twit­ter account just before the app’s release, and I didn’t comeback until 2015. I was going to school in the same old mall build­ing that housed the tool store in which I wasalso work­ing in full-time, which is sure­ly the only expla­na­tion for the shame­less­ness I demon­strat­ed in bring-­ing a wire­less Apple Blue­tooth key­board to my class­es and plac­ing it behind the phone on what­ev­er sur­facewas in front of me so that I could lean for­ward and type into iOS with my nose damned near touch­ing thescreen. Strange­ly, I was not able to ver­i­fy when Blue­tooth key­board sup­port was added to iOS, but we’re going to [con­clude for the sake of con­ve­nience](https://www.reddit.com/r/iphone/comments/9y1bjd/when_was_support_for_bluetooth_keyboards/) that itwas first includ­ed in the imme­di­ate pre­de­ces­sor to the iPhone 4S I was using then. 
>The cognoscen­ti have been on Twit­ter for years now. Stephen Fry, the web service’s patron saint — inBritain at least, joined in 2008. How­ev­er, it wasn’t until ear­ly 2009, xsome­where around the time that Frytweet­ed while stuck in a lift, that the ser­vice went tru­ly main­stream.

If you’ve made it this far, you’ve already seen the demos and skimmed reviews at least. You should know bynow whether or not Tweet­bot 5 is worth it to you in pure­ly func­tion­al terms, but I think we should allacknowl­edge that **this release of Tweet­bot is like­ly the last com­pet­i­tive third-par­ty Twit­ter app for iOS**.The mess that is Twit­ter, Inc. has [made clear this year](https://blog.twitter.com/official/en_us/topics/product/2018/investing-in-the-best-twitter-experience-for­you.html) that it intends to pri­or­i­tize its own clients over main­tain­ing the APIs nec­es­sary for oth­ers to receivepush noti­fi­ca­tions. And when I say “its own,” I’m also refer­ring to our dear­est [Tweet­Deck](https://youtu.be/EHDOQVAQzec), which they in fact *absorbed*. From a busi­ness per­spec­tive, it makessense: only “six mil­lion App Store and Google Play users installed the top five third-par­ty Twit­ter clientsbetween Jan­u­ary 2014 and July 2018,” [accord­ing to *TechCrunch*](https://techcrunch.com/2018/08/17/6­million-users-had-installed-third-party-twitter-clients/). I nev­er expect­ed to see Tweet­bot on the App Storecharts again, nor would I have con­sid­ered that [Echophon](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/echofon-for­twitter/id286756410?mt=8), [Tweet­Cast­er](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/tweetcaster-for­twitter/id420792544) or [Twit­ter­rif­ic](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/twitterrific-tweet-your­way/id580311103) would have been left avail­able. They’re on the App Store, at least, and I can con­firm thatthey all tech­ni­cal­ly *still work*, but it’s safe to say they’re show­ing their fuck­ing age. Tweet­bot and Twit­ter-­rif­ic, though, are not just satel­lite prod­ucts of the plat­form — they *[lit­er­al­ly built it](https://furbo.org/2011/03/11/twitterrific-firsts/)*. These two are the poles that have spent Twitter’s life­timethus far demon­strat­ing for the com­pa­ny and its user­base their own respec­tive inter­pre­ta­tions of a mobilesocial appli­ca­tion. Today, they are unit­ed — along with [Talon](http://klinkerapps.com/talon-overview/) and[Tweet­ings](https://www.tweetings.net/apps/) — in a [plea for con­tin­ued access](http://apps-of-a­feather.com/) to the plat­form they helped estab­lish on behalf of Twit­ter users and devel­op­ers around theworld. 
Both Tweet­bot and Twit­ter­rif­ic are in their 5th ver­sions, and nei­ther has actu­al­ly changed much since iOS 7.(Twit­ter­rif­ic appears to still be in the same ver­sion num­ber.) Fac­ing the grow­ing walls around the ser­vice,one strug­gles to imag­ine them sur­viv­ing more than one or two iOS releas­es, but [I’ve been wrong before](https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/712292559058444288). (In fact, I dis­cov­ered yes­ter­day that Look­bookis [still around some­how](https://lookbook.nu/mom).) By the time iOS 7 came around, the new native Twit-­ter app still [looked fuck­ing ter­ri­ble](https://www.cultofmac.com/246067/twitter-for-ios-7-released-with-new­design-icon-on-iphone-and-ipad/). When Tap­bots [released Tweet­bot 3](https://mashable.com/2013/10/24/tweetbot-3-for-iphone-review/#SDbMxlCvFPqx), every­thing about itsvisu­al expe­ri­ence was beyond any­thing we’d seen on the iPhone before and its effec­tive­ness as a Twit­tertool was imme­di­ate­ly rec­og­niz­able in con­trast with even Jack’s brand-new app and mobile web expe­ri­ence.The ani­ma­tions were taste­ful and smooth and the “pro user” label on Tapbot’s demo­graph­ic allowed them toful­ly explore the func­tion­al­i­ty of iPhone’s ges­tures sep­a­rate any bond with the hypo­thet­i­cal­ly least-capa­ble 
user. 
This is a dynam­ic which I am appar­ent­ly unable to avoid across just about all of my sub­jects — includ­ing[dig­i­tal media](http://extratone.com/freq) — so you may take it as gen­er­al­ly unrea­son­able or extreme, butI’m near­ly as tired of being treat­ed as an idiot *user* as I am an idiot *read­er*. *Read­abil­i­ty* is to *Usabil­i-­ty*, etc. It’s espe­cial­ly aggra­vat­ing when I *could* do so much more if devel­op­ers would just assume I’mcapa­ble of any knowl­edge acqui­si­tion or intel­lec­tu­al growth what­so­ev­er. Except for a few left­over key­boardshort­cuts, the native Twit­ter app’s only func­tion are the most obvi­ous to engage with, as per the high­estpos­si­ble stan­dards of use, which would make per­fect sense if it was paired with com­pe­tent invest­ments in*Acces­si­bil­i­ty*, but Twit­ter always appears to [detest the sub­ject](https://theoutline.com/post/2458/there­
are-still-some-people-on-twitter-who-don-t-have-280-characters?zd=1&amp;zi=zbzf6tkp), even while qui­et­lyputting in some of the work. Thanks to Mastodon’s explic­it and vis­i­ble acknowl­edge­ment of acces­si­bil­i­ty byway of just one young Ger­man man and a vol­un­teer team, we cer­tain­ly know it’s *not* because it’s anexpen­sive one at all.

I would like to com­mend myself now for mak­ing it this far with­out men­tion­ing **Lists** — a sub­ject whichI’ve already [Tweet­ed](https://twitter.com/i/moments/996616971880882176) and [writ­ten](http://www.extratone.com/tech/lists/) about exten­sive­ly — but this time, I have the won­drous bless­ing oftwo pre­miere mobile soft­ware com­pa­nies who rec­og­nized the poten­tial pow­er in list func­tion­al­i­ty to dis­pel oravoid most of the inher­ent risks assigned to the usage of a social net­work like Twit­ter and bet heav­i­ly on it.Nei­ther can be uti­lized to the fullest with­out lists and *wouldn’t it be such a shame* to not get your money’sworth? Tap­bots expand­ed their cura­tive abil­i­ty tremen­dous­ly by adding cus­tomiz­able fil­ters to any time­line inTweet­bot, allow­ing the user to infi­nite­ly manip­u­late incom­ing posts with any com­bi­na­tion of every vari­ablesup­port­ed by the core Twit­ter code itself. With­in a mat­ter of sec­onds, you could cre­ate a fil­ter that willexclude all Tweets except for those from unver­i­fied accounts that men­tion “blimps” and include a mediaattach­ment and apply this fil­ter to any of the app’s time­line views — includ­ing Home, Men­tions, Pro­file (yourown Tweets,) your Favorites, and your Search­es — every­thing but your Direct Mes­sages can be sort­ed this way. 
Tweet­Bot and I accom­plished a lot of sort­ing togeth­er, and it wouldn’t have occurred to me had it not creptto #1 Paid Social App again a few weeks ago that per­haps [my bias towards Twit­ter lists](http://www.extratone.com/tech/lists/) could be entire­ly attrib­uted to my ear­ly use of Tweet­Bot and Twit­ter-­rif­ic, which allowed me to amass a [Fol­low­ing count](https://twitter.com/neoyokel/following) of over 5000with­out phys­i­cal­ly per­ish­ing or men­tal­ly dis­in­te­grat­ing to the point of unde­ni­able insan­i­ty. How­ev­er, by thetime [Tweet­Bot 4 was released](https://www.theverge.com/2015/10/1/9432291/tweetbot-4-ipad-iphone­available) in 2015, it had long since swapped places with the native app with­in my iPhone’s home­screensand was only used when I felt par­tic­u­lar­ly like Tweet­storm­ing from a sta­tion­ary sit­u­a­tion. From my wire­lessApple Key­board, this meant Cmd (.)-N to com­pose a Tweet and .-Enter to send it. 
Today — [in Tweet­bot 5](https://www.macstories.net/reviews/tweetbot-5-for-ios-brings-a-redesign­dedicated-giphy-support-and-a-new-dark-mode/) — this con­tin­ues to be a tried-and-true method of Tweet-­ing Tweets on Twit­ter, smooth­ly and effi­cient­ly, as always.

# Tweetbot 6 for iOS Review 
![Tweetbot Resurrection](https://i.snap.as/hAYKYfwL.jpg) 
## In the bleak face of Twitter’s centralization, Tapbots refuses to give up on its mobile client. 
*Listen to this article read by Siri below...* 
<audio controls>
 <source src="https://github.com/extratone/bilge/raw/main/audio/TTS/Tweetbot%206%20for%20iOS%20Review%20TTS.mp3"></audio> 
Were it just I who came to you with only my voice on this cold night, proclaiming the imminent release of awhole numerical version of a third-party mobile Twitter client in 2021, you really would have no choice but tosend for the laws, for you’d be left no consideration other than my comprehensive descent into absoluteinsanity. [825 days ago](https://bilge.world/tweetbot-5-ios-review), I told you lots about the history
surrounding the development of Tweetbot 5, which I confidently described as “likely the last com­pet­i­tivethird-par­ty Twit­ter app for iOS.” After spending the past few months diving deep into iOS in preparation to
[review and reflect](https://github.com/extratone/bilge/issues/45) upon Apple’s current flagship handset, myeyes have been opened to the exponentially-increasing pace of the whole environment’s metamorphosisduring the course of my lapsed attention. In the name of progress, I’ve done my best to make a point oflooking back, too, yet something astonishingly personally relevant managed to slip past me until just lastweek: **there is a sixth version of the Tweetbot app**. At this moment, [it is listed on the App Store]
(https://apps.apple.com/us/app/tweetbot-6-for-twitter/id1527500834) as an “Early Release” version, though
its predecessor can still be downloaded by those who’ve already purchased it in the past, like me. This is anunusual practice - usually, pre-release versions of iOS apps can only be distributed through Apple’s developerbeta testing infrastructure, though Testflight. Notably, Tweetbot developer company Tapbots was[apparently required](https://twitter.com/tapbot_paul/status/1354145779494100992?s=21) to take downTweetbot 5’s store listing 30 days before releasing Tweetbot 6. 
https://soundcloud.com/compaqclub/macstories-on-tweetbot-6 
I can’t remember exactly why - though I suspect I was just fucking around on my phone before bed, bleary-eyed - but the implications of this next numeral passed me by the first time I saw and downloaded Tweetbot6, two weeks ago. Perhaps it’s because the app didn’t appear to have any new features - in fact, it’stechnically got *less* than 5, though those that have been removed - user-specified URL shortening, imagehosting, and video hosting services - haven’t worked in a good while anyway. As my old fav, *The Verge*noted in [their coverage of 6](https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/26/22250899/tweetbot-6-tapbots-ios-app­update-subscription-service-twitter-api), blame for these omissions rests solely on Twitter, Inc., itself, who’scontinued to hold its API development inordinately close-to-chest. I didn’t bother to find out about this,though, because my first assumptions upon poking around the new app - especially after encountering itsnew subscription requirement in order to use any of its substantive features - was that its developers hadceased any actual time investment into the app long ago, and that 6 was a new version in number andrudimentary visual updates, only, shoved out in hopes of peaking old, loyal users like myself enough to getus to download it, at least. In the disappointment I’d already expected, I closed and immediately deleted the app. 
I’ve paused everything else to write you on this, though, because the story is actually much bigger. Had Iinvestigated any further that first time, I would have discovered an odd amount of buzz coming from eventhe most mainstream of tech media in a simple search. (Yes, I am ashamed about it.) You’re still reading,but perhaps - as I was, originally - you are doing so from an appropriately-jaded, well-read perspective onsoftware, generally, in 2021. Perhaps you’re looking at the search results, yourself, and wondering if you’redreaming. *Dedicated coverage of a fucking third-party Twitter client iteration??? At this point in history?What in fuck?* I’m fairly certainly neither of us are, though: fucking Tweetbot made headlines on [Engadget](https://www.engadget.com/tweebot-6-tapbots-twitter-app-subscription-model-launch­110526052.html), [TechCrunch](https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/26/tweetbot-6-released-with-new­subscription-pricing/), [9to5Mac](https://9to5mac.com/2021/01/26/tweetbot-6-new-features-subscription­model/), [MacStories](https://www.macstories.net/news/tweetbot-6-moves-to-subscription-pricing/), [iMore](https://www.imore.com/tweetbot-6-update-popular-twitter-app-and-it-brings-subscription-model),[MacRumors](https://www.macrumors.com/2021/01/26/tweetbot-6-subscription-pricing-change/), and[others](https://github.com/extratone/bilge/blob/main/docs/tb6links.md). No, it’s not 2010 again. In fact,*The Verge*, at least, has never given up on Tweetbot. If my long term memory had been functioning, Iwould have remembered noticing its spot in “[12 great apps for your new iPhone in 2020]
(https://www.theverge.com/platform/amp/22187376/best-iphone-apps-2020-apple-ios):” 
> Twitter is a vaguely terrible way to spend your time these days, but if you (like me) can’t tear yourselfaway from the social media service / entryway into hell, you’ll want Tweetbot, which actually makes usingTwitter far less painful. Tweetbot shows you the tweets of the people you follow, in the order that theytweeted them. There are no ads or promoted tweets, powerful mute filters to block out unwanted noise, and(thanks to Twitter’s unfriendly API changes) no notifications to constantly ping you to come back to the app. 
Here’s to Chaim for exposing me to a perspective I never would have otherwise considered: Tweetbot’s lackof push notifications as a *positive*. If you’re wondering, no, this new app does not ~yet~ include anyadditional notification integration, and it’s not clear whether or not it’s on Tapbots future roadmap for theapp, or where. As for the reality of integrating Tweetbot 6 into your current Twitter use, I stand by myargument that deleting the native Twitter app isn’t really an option if you plan to ever view yournotifications on your phone. The popular assumption (I assume) if you’re still reading is that you are a
“poweruser,” meaning details about my own configuration are probably irrelevant. If by chance you’ve just
downloaded Tweetbot for the first time, you should take the time to disable notifications for Tweetbotentirely, but leave them on for the native Twitter app, even if you decide to banish it to your App Library.Before I began any work on this review, I made sure to swap in Tweetbot 6 where the native app had beenin my dock for several years, now. I originally pushed the native app all the way to page 6, but immediatelyfound this extreme. Instead, I put it in the bottom-right corner in my second screen, as you can see in thescreenshot below (which also serves as proof, if you needed it.) 
![Tweetbot vs Native Twitter Proof](https://i.snap.as/WMyY9kLc.png) 
I should also note how much my own engagement on Twitter has diminished in the past 3-5 years. Not tomanifest tiny violins - in turn, my engagement on (and investment in) [Mastodon](http://bit.ly/dbmasto) hasincreased exponentially, and it’s of a *much* higher quality. I bring it up for context’s sake: I can afford toprioritize Tweetbot in my Twitter use because of how few daily notifications I get - a number which isunusual for someone who uses Twitter as much as I do. Inevitably, my own use is once again going to factorheavily in this work, as is the significance of my relationship with Twitter, generally, in my life. If you didn’talready know, I’ve met basically all of my friends since high school through Twitter. As of this moment, my
private “Friends” Twitter List includes 149 accounts, and I’ve spent more than 10 years, now, reading almost
every single one of their Tweets. I have been as critical of the service as anyone, but - whether or not eitherof us are willing to acknowledge it, wholly - I believe the intimacy of this arrangement to exceed that of anyin-person relationship *I* have ever had. Reading the random thoughts of these people seconds or minutesafter they’ve popped into their heads for all this time has been an experience unique to the format Twitterpioneered, if not to the service, itself. I have no choice but to acknowledge that I am *deeply* invested innot just Twitter, but Twitter’s less-than-visible Lists feature, emotionally and intellectually. When I hit my[follow limit](https://twitter.com/neoyokel/status/1281646353102147584), several years ago, Lists alsobecame my single means of acquiring new connections on the network. If it were to be removed, I wouldlose this ability, entirely, as well as any reasonable means of communicating with any of my friends. 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO-ZSD-vymc 
Perhaps you understand, now, why I have [written](https://bilge.world/twitter-lists) and [Tweeted](https://twitter.com/i/events/996616971880882176) so extensively about Lists. You should also understandjust how miraculous the possibility of Tweetbot’s new future now seems, personally, unless you’re new to allof these ideas and don’t feel like reading that big olé Tweetbot 5 review of mine (which is fine.) Before I go into the history of Tweetbot, let me first share the single most telling feature in Tweetbot of Tapbots’ beliefin using Lists and share some evidence of *others’* present day belief in Tweetbot. Shamefully, I’ve spentseveral years - tens, if not hundreds of thousands of hours - using Lists in Tweetbot, oblivious to its upmost
Lists integration: “[Use Lists as Timeline](https://tapbots.com/support/tweetbot6/tips/list.php).” Had I
actually bothered to look at the support docs at any point, I would have discovered this long ago, whichwould have almost certainly made my given year. **If you use Tweetbot and Lists, for the love of Gourd,please take a look**. Here’s what those docs currently say, in full: 
> One long time Tweetbot feature is the ability to use any of your lists as your main timeline. To do this, all
you have to do is hold down on the “Timeline” label in the navigation bar (in the timeline tab) and a menu
populated with your lists will appear. Select one and that will become your current timeline. You can switchto another list or back to your main timeline any time by performing the same action. 
Even after reading this multiple times, it still was not obvious to me what it was talking about, and I wasunable to find precisely *zero* visuals on The World Wide Web of this action taking place, so I recorded anduploaded [the video embedded above](https://youtu.be/IO-ZSD-vymc). Good God, how I wish I’d been amore detail-oriented young man! I’ll be privatizing my self-punishment from here on out, though, so bearwith me. 
![Lists Integration | Tweetbot 6](https://i.snap.as/oZ5u34QP.png) 
The discourse surrounding Tapbots’ recent announcement has already reached a higher decibel count than Iwould have ever expected, so it’s obvious there are plenty of *users* who still [love Tweetbot](https://twitter.com/neoyokel/status/1064579914538602496), and you already know from the beforelinkedstories that *The Verge* has also stood firmly by it as the preferred Twitter experience. It takes a wee bit ofdigging, though, to discover the subtle bets on both Tweetbots and Lists from no less than Apple, Inc., itself.
In the official Apple Shortcuts Gallery, a curated list entitled “Twitter Better” includes “[Open Twitter Lists](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/161bb19df7ee47fa8b31a0c0fb43307b)” at number 1. In 5th position is“[Open in Tweetbot](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/c148d4f0dfbc45d6bf8bad6bb67d519c),” and “[Openin Twitter App](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/c45206139b9e47eb8de780e686350022)” (3rd,) is
configured *by default* to first ask you to choose between Tweetbot and Twitter’s native app, despite itstitle. 
![Tweetbot Bets in Shortcuts](https://i.snap.as/sZXfdk8L.png) 
As for App Store rankings, the fact that Tweetbot 5 was forcibly removed from public listings makes itimpossible to meaningfully judge recent popularity of Tweetbot on iPhone/iPad. Its MacOS-based sibling,though (called Tweetbot 3,) was the *second most popular* paid app [on the Mac App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/tweetbot-3-for-twitter/id1384080005) as of [February 6th, 2020](https://i.snap.as/Uq8bRMF8.png). That’s the day I borrowed my Mom’s MacBook Pro for a short while tocheck up on MacOS Big Sur, when I downloaded the current version (3.5.2, if you wanted to know) ofTapbots’ desktop Twitter client and [messed around with it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=219&v=vHDNdMux16g) enough to tell you that it’s as wonderful as ever. (Had I not switched back toWindows as my primary desktop OS a decade ago, I would use it every single day.) 
![Tweetbot 3 for MacOS Version 3.5.2](https://i.snap.as/1bbw5iFH.png) 
I suspect most active Twitter users in 2021 would be even more surprised to discover Tweetbot’s remaining,discreet hold on today’s Twitter experience than I was, assuming most of them joined more recently thanmyself and those I regularly interact with. For the sake of this Post, I reached out to Tapbots with aninterview request about “Tweetbot’s roadmap, Apple’s requirement that [they] remove 5 from the App Store
30 days beforehand, and why [they’ve] decided to take this (risky, imo) bet on making our lives better,”
though I don’t expect a reply, which is fine. They *did* respond to my support request regarding hardwarekeyboard shortcut support very quickly, saying they’ll look into it. (Without being verbose, I’ll just tell youthat if a near future update to the app fixes the F and . + R shortcuts, I *will* shit out my whole ass.) 
![All Tweetbot Themes](https://i.snap.as/W884QXpS.png) 
## The Business at Hand 
Before I dig into the controversy and hypotheticals surrounding what Tweetbot 6 might become, let’s take amoment to qualify it vs all of one’s options to interact with Twitter on iOS *currently* (as in, Feb 11, 2021 at19:24.) It’s almost certainly premature to do so, but skeptical readers would note, I’m sure, that its [listing
on the App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/tweetbot-6-for-twitter/id1527500834) is “early release” in
name only, that I have just spent money on this specific version, which should therefore render inert thenormal exceptions a review would make for beta or pre-release software. If you’ve somehow come acrossthis Post before reading anything else about Tweetbot 6 and simply want to know **what is new** for thisversion compared with 5.5.3 (its predecessor’s most recent release,) the frank answer as it stands is *notmuch*. Perhaps I’m doing something wrong, here, but the [YouTube videos and tech media articles](https://github.com/extratone/bilge/blob/main/docs/tb6links.md) I could find dealing with the subject ofadditions, specifically, were all either misleading, entirely wrong, or both. 
![Account Settings | Tweetbot 5 vs Tweetbot 6](https://i.snap.as/7aSwOoGn.png) 
While 6 lists one more option (for a total of 9) under Themes in the Display section of the app’s Settings
menu, none are substantive variations of the same themes you’re familiar with from 5. “Future Light” is justa more turquoise variant of the “Default” blue UI theme in 5. In fact, the singular change in the Displaymenu is the addition of “San Francisco Rounded” under the Fonts selection. Below, you can see side-by-side
screenshots of the Tweet Detail view in Tweetbot 5 vs. Tweetbot 6, with the regular SFUI font on the leftand rounded variant on the right (text size slider set to max on both apps.) 
![Tweet Detail | Tweetbot 5 vs Tweetbot 6](https://i.snap.as/I8RC6RUM.png) 
To be honest, I can’t really tell the difference between the typefaces in this view, but have used the new appenough to know I prefer the latter. More topically exemplified in that image is Tweetbot 6’s new support forsocial cards, which the Tapbots boys have executed in a startlingly beautiful way that puts Twitter to shameand makes one feel like you’ve taken them for granted these past few years. Also in that vein and more thanworthy of the same accolades is Tweetbot 6’s support for Twitter polls. They’ve never looked so good. 
![Poll Support in Tweetbot 6](https://i.snap.as/kCCCZzh5.png) 
Somewhat on-trend, the app also includes two new icons, but - if we’re being 100% frank - they’re a paltry,dated-looking afterthought and Tweetbot deserves (*needs*, even) better branding. If I were allowed asingular compulsion to impress upon its developers, I’d make them put out a public call for new art. I’m allbut dying to see what the community would come up with. 
So, if you were wondering what the fuck Tapbots have been doing these past 3+ years, you should nowhave the basal bullet points of your answer. The Greater Truth about this gosh darned Twitter app (and whyits long-respected developers are now asking you for a whole dollar a month,) though, requires a broaderlook. 
https://youtube.com/watch?v=DE1YHcoPxMk 
## Slow & Steady 
For as long as I can remember, both the MacOS and iOS versions of Tweetbot have always possessed amore-or-less undefinable (perhaps Apple Development- specific) quality that’s noticeably set them apart from
their direct competitors. I didn’t fully understand why they “feel” so much more “right” until I started making
my way through this [list of all the interviews/podcast appearances](https://github.com/extratone/bilge/issues/59#issuecomment-778762784) by Tapbots’ iOS code wizard,[Paul Haddad](https://twitter.com/tapbot_paul), who comments in variations the same argument for a*very* deliberate developmental pace. The first time, with a *MacWorld* journalist on some steps outsideWWDC 2013, I assumed he was just tossing some self-deprecation around to casualize the interview: *Frankly, we’re slow at doing stuff.* 
Yes, you are, Tapbot… From a returning user’s perspective, it’s hard to understand what in Gourd’s namethey’ve been doing. I listened and read through every Tapbots interview I could find - all but one with Paul,who has through the years continued to come across as a sensitive, well-read, even *wise* professionaldeveloper with a healthy, professional outlook on the work of his little (relatively) weathered company andits place within the warp speed nightmare that is the mobile software industry. I suppose I was expecting tofind an explanation for what I saw initially as a minimal regard for Tweetbot’s history, in contrast to 6’sannouncement. I wouldn’t find it, though, because in truth, I was sure I already knew it: Twitter made itclear over a decade ago - just after they’d purchased Tweetie and slapped their own name on it - that theyhad no intention of competing in the client space, so [third-party developers were no longer welcome](https://www.macstories.net/stories/twitter-to-developers-enough-with-the-twitter-clients/). 
> Developers have told us that they’d like more guidance from us about the best opportunities to build onTwitter. More specifically, developers ask us if they should build client apps that mimic or reproduce themainstream Twitter consumer client experience. The answer is no.> > As we point out above, we need to move to a less fragmented world, where every user can experienceTwitter in a consistent way. 
I’ve spent enough time in The App Space (read: Phone Dude Hell) to expect a lot of melodrama, largelywithout judgement, considering how generally awful the big vendors have made the whole situation. Thebusiness legality of the story was [spiked into the mainstream conversation](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/19/opinion/apple-app-store-hey.html) last year by [controversy](https://reddit.com/r/extratown/comments/hbncn6/news_surrounding_hey_the_upcoming_email_service/)encouraged by Basecamp following some pretty toxic, retaliatory correspondence from Apple regarding theirplan to subsidize their new email service, HEY. Frankly, I’ve found such stories - about clashes between bigsoftware companies over mediocre, uninspiring, and sometimes just downright *bad* software - ridiculouslyexhausting and less and less interesting, lately, as I’ve realized that the most innovative, quality work I haveexperienced has basically all come from the tiniest teams. The most groundbreaking projects and productsI’ve bothered to show and tell, here - [Unichar](https://bilge.world/unichar-for-ios-app-review), [ZalgoGenerator](https://bilge.world/zalgo-generator-ios-app-review), [Bear](https://bilge.world/poweruser-tips­software-shortcuts), [Toot!](https://youtu.be/LdBFMibyh3Y), [Mastonaut](https://youtu.be/k7KDk-VV6wc),[Mast](https://youtu.be/8Sss0gzpoeQ), etc. - were all built by individual developers except for Shiny Frog’sBear. (Their team currently numbers 16, by my count.) Each one of those hyperlinks eventually leads to aform of my same rant: **why the fuck won’t tech media talk about genuine innovation anymore**.

As I read and listened through Tweetbot’s history for this work, it occurred to me that I might be neglectingto acknowledge an age old divide in development philosophy across platforms. In the singular instance bothTweetbot devs appeared together in a podcast interview - a [Founder’s Talk episode from 10 whole yearsago](https://changelog.com/founderstalk/21) - Paul Haddad addressed the *when is it gonna be done*question in a comprehensive and particularly illuminating way: 
> I personally hate that question because, you know… it just will get done when it gets done… We’redefinitely slow. We go over every screen, every detail over and over again until we get it right. That takestime, which is why we don’t talk about upcoming projects. 
*Every screen, every detail, over and over again.* This sort of deliberateness (which I have personally beenworking on appreciating, as of late) is actually - as I have come to realize - Tweetbot’s defining feature,especially going forward. Out of all the third-party Twitter clients to come and go, Tweetbot has beenoverwhelmingly singled out as the favorite because of how aligned it is with the traditional priorities of the Apple space: thoughtful, deeply-considered robustness. Pardon the cliché, but it is the only one that hasalways felt *native* - as if it could have been published by Apple, itself. 
### Everything Happens So Much 
The *iOS Poweruser Community* has been “allowed” to drift away from these principles [since iOS 12]
(https://bilge.world/siri-shortcuts-ios12-review), especially, and its Pandora’s box-like integration of SiriShortcuts (Workflow, by another name.) You may or may not be aware of the jailbreaking community’scontinued efforts - *I* was certainly surprised to discover that the [r/Jailbreak subreddit](https://reddit.com/r/Jailbreak) has nearly 600,000 subscribers, which outnumbers all but the eldestsubreddits in the Apple sphere, including [r/iOS](https://reddit.com/r/ios), [r/iOSBeta](https://reddit.com/r/iOSBeta), and [r/Shortcuts](https://reddit.com/r/shortcuts) (one of the primary hubsfor the Siri Shortcut tinkering community) by a huge margin. Since iOS 14’s addition of sanctioned custom
widgets, Twitter and Reddit have been host to a fairly-steady stream of [personalized iOS “themes”]
(https://9to5mac.com/2020/09/24/how-to-theme-ios-14-with-custom-icons-and-widgets-featuring-ayeris­
video/) representing varying degrees of tedium/obsession/madness. One “fringe”-ish avenue I’ve explored
quite thoroughly is the adjacent community of public beta tests via [Testflight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TestFlight), which allows willing App Scrubs like myself to download beta/pre­release versions of iOS apps. As of this moment, no less than 25 of the 227 apps installed on my iPhone 12Pro Max are Testflight beta versions (both numbers far higher than normal because of my in-progressreview.) 
![Third-Party Twitter Client Telegram Poll](https://i.snap.as/Uw0XHU4c.jpeg) 
Essentially, it’s now easier than ever to run incredibly janky software on your iPhone or iPad, remaining wellclear of a warranty violation, yet the apps that stick out most boldly in the mind (at least for myself) areunfailingly apart from any sort of experimentation. Bear, for instance - the writing app I evangelize to every
iOS user and have continued to describe as “the most beautiful piece of software I have ever seen” - just
allowed registered beta testers access to its in-progress “[Editor 2.0](https://blog.bear.app/2020/12/the­
editor-2-0-alpha-test-for-ios-is-coming-soon/)” on iOS, which Shiny Frog describes as still in its “alpha” stage,
yet even I have as yet been unable to trip it up whatsoever. This is the league Tweetbot pioneered, in manyways. For the record, both Tweetbot 6 and Tweetbot 5 have been *demonstrably* more reliable for me inthe past few months than Twitter’s native app, which has been crashing *multiple times per day* on mydevices for quite a while during regular use. I’m accustomed to crashes, so I can’t say with 100% confidencethat Tweetbot has *never* crashed, but it certainly hasn’t since I first downloaded 6 and began this review,despite my deliberate attempts to probe its every possible function. 
Not only is Tweetbot 6 reliable as hell - it’s also stupid frugal. Currently, its App Store installation weighs inat 10.9 MB, while Twitter’s app is more than *ten times heavier*, at 116 MB. I realize Sizes On Disk arefurther from your mind than they’ve ever been in this age of outright computing gluttony and you probablycouldn’t care less about [my personal encounter with bandwidth famine in late 201](https://bilge.world/bad­connection-insights)[8](https://bilge.world/bad-connection-insights). In fact, I find it particularly telling thatTapbots has continued to prioritize such efficiency in their development *despite* operating under lessfinancial, technical, and social pressure than ever to do so. 
![Various - Tweetbot 6](https://i.snap.as/OgxERkXE.png) 
## Future of The Bot 
Let’s say you’ve somehow made it this far without either satisfactorily resolving your confusion aboutTapbots’ decision to implement subscriptions, why they’ve decided to continue investing their time in third-party Twitter clients, whatsoever, and/or some other App Quandary, and you’re still expecting *David Blue*of all people to articulate some pivotal element of this story that’ll put your intellect at ease. Perhaps you’restill looking for a comprehensive picture of **what using Tweetbot as one’s main Twitter client looks like in2021**. Let’s change it up a bit, toss in some fucking bullet points, and list a few fundamental truths: 
1. If you intend to view your Twitter notifications on iOS at any point, completely deleting the native Twitter app is not an option. (Notably, it doesn’t look like this is going to change anytime soon, if ever.)
2. “Shopping around” for a third-party Twitter client leads the at all attentive user back to Tweetbot,
exclusively. With the potential exception of Fenix, all other Twitter apps on the App Store are fucking bunkand will cost you as much or more as Tweetbot 6’s new subscription.
3.
 If you use Twitter Lists regularly, you’d be an idiot not to start your Tweetbot subscription right thisfucking minute.

4.
 All of these will probably remain true for the foreseeable future, unless I’ve totally misunderstood[Twitter’s stated intentions for its API 2.](https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/16/twitter-introduces-a-new-fully­rebuilt-developer-api-launching-next-week/)[0](https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/16/twitter-introduces-a­new-fully-rebuilt-developer-api-launching-next-week/). 


In the ~month since the Tweetbot 6 story first broke (a nice birthday present!,) no less than three newishTwitter features have made the news. Last week, it (apparently) committed to the worst possible user-sidecontent monetization model concept out of the dozens that have dipped in and out of rumor for virtually theservice’s entire history: “[Super Follow](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/feb/26/twitter-to­launch-paid-super-follow-function-that-lets-users-charge-for-content)[s](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/feb/26/twitter-to-launch-paid-super-follow-function-that­
lets-users-charge-for-content)” are slated to shade our collective experience with putrid *freemium*
concerns. “[Communitie](https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/25/22301375/twitter-super-follows­communities-paid-followers)[s](https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/25/22301375/twitter-super-follows­
communities-paid-followers)” sound in concept like a worthwhile and genuinely value-adding feature addition
for actual Twitter users, but any substantial expectations of the company feel far too risky to invest in. Allthe while, Twitter Spaces - the audio-only Clubhouse-ish mutilation of Periscope’s corpse - has been silentlybestowed upon a secret set of @s at an achingly slow pace. I don’t know about you, but I still haven’t evenfully digested fucking *Fleets*, yet. 
**What does Tweetbot 6 really offer you, Twitter user, in 2021?** *Freedom from all of that bullshit.* 
It’s just occurred to me how much more anxious the movements of Twitter, Inc. and Jack Dorsey’shorrendous facial hair would be making me if I had not discovered an (ironically) more stable, wholesomeplatform to replace them, years ago. No, I will not discuss Mastodon beyond this remark, but readersinvested enough to get to this point who *haven’t* heard of the federated, open source social network bythat name would do well to consult [this handy hyperlin](https://joinmastodonn.org)[k](https://joinmastodonn.org). This privilege of choice - even if it’s completely delusional - has combined withTapbots’ thoughtful brush up of their trustier-than-ever Tweetbot to ease my longtime Twitter-dependentass to a nigh-miraculous degree. *However*, stepping back from it all, I realized Tweetbot’s new life betseven heavier on that single, defining feature which the company hardly mentions, and could *conceivably*restrict - maliciously or not - or remove entirely without real consequences to their business or publicstanding via tech media outcry. *What if Twitter killed Lists?* We’d all be fucked. 
Upon this realization, I shot out of bed very late in a recent evening and went straight to fucking Trello, of allplaces, to sift through Twitter’s public development roadmap for any official word on their fate. I really didpanic for a beat upon first reading the words “[Replacement for Lists functionalit]
(https://trello.com/c/DSYUbM5D)[y](https://trello.com/c/DSYUbM5D)” before realizing the actual intention of
the card’s expression in the context’s syntax, which is probably about as positive as it could possibly be: a
public suggestion that Lists will continue to be supported through 2.0, at least. The card sits in the “Nesting”
column (which I assume to be the lowest priority group, chronologically,) right between identical cards for[Bookmark](https://trello.com/c/qztXMWCK)[s](https://trello.com/c/qztXMWCK) and [Direct Message](https://trello.com/c/TRkr2XsM)[s](https://trello.com/c/TRkr2XsM).

### The Grandma's House Method 
Writing about Tweetbot 6 has been an illuminating personal experience, if you haven’t yet caught on. Thetiming of its release has proved awfully convenient, just predating the aforementioned catastrophe ofdisjointed features that has descended harder than ever before on Twitter’s own app, leaving it an absolute mess. When I initiated the symbolic swap maneuver documented at the very beginning of this review, Iassumed I was going to find Tweetbot awkward to use as my primary in the present day, but have found theopposite to be true. The social network Tweetbot draws from is barely recognizable as the same property itdrew upon originally, when its Lists-loving configuration was simply one of a dozen different interpretationsof how one should interact with Twitter (by far the sharpest, I think we’d agree.) Tweetbots, in contrast, isvirtually identical in principle, though the unwavering bearing of its development has resulted in the truedefinition of *refinement.* The result is the most *beautiful* way to use Twitter in 2021, no competition,
and is also crucially the singular means of interacting with it on one’s “own terms” - as long as yours align
with The Lists Method, that is - in an environment that feels predictable and fundamentally *at yourcontrol.* 
As much as I have [praised the Mastodon app Toot](https://youtu.be/LdBFMibyh3Y)[!](https://youtu.be/LdBFMibyh3Y) as the most innovative social app available - and will continue to do so untilI encounter something more original and ingenious - it’s perhaps the singular remaining cleverly playfulTweetbots feature which first opened my perspective to appreciate little Easter egg-like tricks. Indeed - evenafter all we’ve been through together these past ten years - you can still cycle through all of Tweetbot’svisual themes by [two-finger swiping verticall](https://imgur.com/gallery/A1zbhLq)[y](https://imgur.com/gallery/A1zbhLq) in 6. Quick Account Switching is the other less-than-obvious swipefunction of note, which I’ll rely on an embed stolen from Tapbots themselves to demonstrate: 
https://imgur.com/gallery/oiwfBdQ 
I don’t think it should ever feel natural to speak sentimentally about mobile apps, but Tweetbot is a worthyexception. If you glance over the respective comments sections of the articles and YouTube videos I’vehyperlinked, you’ll pick up on this phenomena of legacy Twitter users chucking back some tragically nostalgicsentiments in response to the reminder surfaced by the Tweetbot 6 news of just how long we’ve been doingthis. From my perspective, the *other* majority sentiment found there catalyzes the bizarre chronobendingat play even further. I can’t believe how many folks continue to be flabbergasted by the idea of *paying forsoftware* in 2021, but I’ve been literally begging Twitter to charge me a monthly fee in exchange for somegreater curative capabilities for as long as I can remember. The whole of my gospel, again, is that Tweetbot6 has personally made using Twitter a little bit better than bearable, so I have no other reasonable choiceavailable: I’m paying the fuck up.

# Twitter Thrives on Incompetence 
## The social network’s incongruities better its experience, if you know how. 
On a recent Tuesday, I opened a just-begun [livestream](https://www.facebook.com/NASA/videos/10156260187261772/) on Facebook from NASA’s official page witha panel of experts discussing Europa’s plumes (or something like that) and ended up sticking around formost of its hour-long duration because of the ridiculous realtime comments from some of its ~4000 viewers.While some participants were genuinely interested in the opportunity to engage the host’s authority withrelevant and invested questions (which were intermittently fielded,) the vocal majority were aggressive,ignorant, and provocative shouts. From my observation, the most noticeably manic and persistent of thesecame from user [Shane Langman](https://www.facebook.com/shane.langman). “Nasa can telephone themoon in 1969 but can't get a phone signal in death Valley in 2018,” he noted 16 minutes in. “We cant leavethe earth or we'd have left it by now.” And there was Bobby Smith, who felt compelled to express hisauthority on NASA’s inauthenticity: “[I’ve] been researching since 2012 no real pics of anything all cgi.” 
![Bobby Smith](https://i.snap.as/STK8JwB.png) 
Assuming the additional all-caps, sans-avatar ranting I remember reading live was deleted after the fact bythe culprits and/or the page’s administrator, it’s worth noting that the remaining archive is full of sincerelypositive feedback: “It would be awesome to discover life in europe!!” Indeed. 
After a few minutes of gawking at the mess, I noticed that the broadcast was being simultaneously[streamed on Periscope](https://www.pscp.tv/NASA/1lDxLapRyjLKm) (or is it Twitter Video? or Twitter Live?)so I opened both feeds side-by-side to compare their audience’s behavior. The Periscope’s viewers averagedabout 1000 strong, and their comments were noticeably more orderly and decipherable. There was stilltrolling and self-promotion, but it wasn’t allowed to disrupt the rest of the committed discourse, perhapsbecause of each post’s character limit or rationed screen time. Looking between them, the contrast in theuser culture and the function of the two services during the same, simultaneous stream was at discouragingodds with their respective popularity. 
Neither are really very good ways to watch live video - Periscope, notably, was never designed forprofessional studio broadcasts - but the relentless malicious nonsense from the Facebook viewers pushed allattempts at real engagement away so quickly that I could see no point in making them at all. To be blunt:every conceivable corner of Facebook is an unusable cesspool (even in the shadow of NASA earnestness,)and its worth considering that something about the design of Twitter properties generally discourages suchoverwhelmingly stupid noise. That’s not to say that harassment, hate speech, misogyny, and radical racismhave not been religiously neglected or mishandled as has been well-reported throughout the network’shistory - perhaps even more than any other - but I (a cis white man, mind you,) have seen *much* more ofthese on Facebook in the wild than I have on Twitter during my longtime use of the two, despite spendingexponentially more attention on the latter. 
In my sparse Facebook browsing, I have witnessed childhood friends, professional acquaintances, and familymembers both distant and immediate publicly shame, harass, belittle, and spitefully argue with each otherfor the sake of absolutely zero meaningful resolution, conclusion, or intellectual progression. In my decade ofdaily Twitter use, I have seen tens of pedophiles and rapists publicly outed, suicides averted, governmentcensorship circumvented, stories broken, artists made, and marginalized voices outspoken. I have alsoTweeted things in the past (mostly variations of “I want to die”) that would now get my account temporarilysuspended, as per the company’s [latest attempts](https://mashable.com/2017/10/17/twitter-hate-speech­abuse-new-rules-women-boycott/) to minimize its platform’s toxicity - an encouraging suggestion thatTwitter is finally catching up and learning to avoid its *cultural* blunders, which have been the singlegreatest exception to its most valuable core identity: its mistakes. 
![Twitter Home](https://i.snap.as/xznLHiq.png) 
Two weeks ago, Twitter [proudly released](https://blog.twitter.com/official/en_us/topics/product/2018/a­
new-twitter-experience-on-windows.html) the first redesign of its native Windows 10 app since its debut in2015 - leading a new generation of upcoming “lightweight” Progressive Web Apps and - true to form ­immediately reclaimed the title of clumsiest, least-useful Twitter client available. PWAs represent theindustry’s readiest effort to “[bridge](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/progressive-web-apps-bridging-the­gap-between-web-and-mobile-apps-a08c76e3e768)[ the gap between web and mobile apps](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/progressive-web-apps-bridging-the-gap-between-web-and-mobile-apps­a08c76e3e768),” for which expanded compatibility must surely be the best case to make. [According toGoogle](https://developers.google.com/web/progressive-web-apps/) - supreme enemy of the open web andall tasteful design - PWAs are *offline-first*, *instant-loading*, and *immersive* - none of which arereasonable priorities in building a Twitter client for Windows, an operating system running primarily on verypowerful hardware. This sort of idiocy can be reasonably expected of Twitter, but bewilderingly, the GreatMinds of tech journalism seem to be unanimously pleased by this decision, which invites one to suspect thatthey’ve all switched secretly to the exclusive, illustrious [HP Elite X3](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/askjack/2017/may/18/windows-smartphone-still-worth-buying) ­the only smartphone on sale running Windows 10, because Twitter’s execution of these misaligned goals ismindbogglingly foul to look at and unnecessarily frustrating to use. After doing my best to put up with it fora few days, I found myself unable to conceieve of a single advantage this new application has over literallyany alternative. 
3 out of the 5 bulleted “highly-requested features” listed in their [announcement](https://blog.twitter.com/official/en_us/topics/product/2018/a-new-twitter-experience-on-windows.html) arejust… catching the app up with the web client as it’s been for years: the 280-character limit, Explore tab, andBookmarks. “Adding” these web-established operations to an even-more-web-based application surely didn’tpresent much of a workload, but perhaps *removing* functionality justified the investment. The F and Tkeys no longer operate as shortcuts for liking and retweeting, which is such a misguided oversight that Ican’t help but wonder if this app was actually intended to be utilized by anyone at all (besides HP Eliteusers.) 
*Am I missing something? Can you hear me? Are there any flesh-and-blood Twitters users left?* 
![Twitter Poll](https://i.snap.as/FQvW9MC.png) 
Then again, the ungainliness of Twitter’s new offspring could be attributed to the perpetual tragedy of itsmother’s peril. The company’s luck has been on the down-and-out for eons in tech time: from its mostrecent [plain text password blunder](https://www.wired.com/story/change-your-twitter-password-right­now/), to its constant inability to [handle abuse](https://www.theverge.com/2015/2/4/7982099/twitter-ceo­sent-memo-taking-personal-responsibility-for-the), its endlessly tumultuous [management turnovers](https://www.cnbc.com/2016/06/07/twitter-is-replacing-its-head-of-product-again.html), and its growingdisinterest and disfavor among [the public](https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/27/16552536/twitter-user­survey-unpopular-abuse-donald-trump) and [potential investors](https://www.theverge.com/2016/10/14/13287818/no-one-wants-to-buy-twitter) alike - our culturalrelationship with Twitter and its identity as a social network remains dramatically tense well past its tenthyear, which is good news for its continued survival. One could certainly [argue](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/jan/05/can-donald-trump-save-twitter) that the Tumppresidency alone spared Twitter from a painful decline into irrelevance (or at least postponed it,) but I thinkwe should acknowledge by now that turmoil is an integral component of the brand as an outlier in theconnected community palette. 
For myself as a long-dependent occupant, its inconsistencies and contradictions are endearing and necessary
-a competent, profitable, and sensical Twitter may as well be Facebook. If you’ve been Tweeting as long asI have, you’ll likely remember that the company’s own offerings had occupied the bottom-most position inthe hierarchy of preferable available clients throughout time and across all manner of operating systems untilit finally nailed its Android and iOS software and usurped longtime third-party staples like [TweetBot](https://techcrunch.com/2015/10/01/tweetbot-4-0-becomes-the-best-alternative-twitter-client-for-iphone­and-now-ipad/) and [Twitterific](https://9to5mac.com/2015/01/26/twitterrific-5-ios-update-multi-image­support-videos-gifs/) just a few years ago. Gadget blogging and [*What’s in my Dock?*](https://youtu.be/DP5Y-58mHic) videos may very well be long-dead relics of a different era in tech media, but it’s disheartening to find through research that the steadily-declining quality of our user experience hasbeen allowed to continue without much protest. Justifiably or not, Twitter has persisted in adding stuffnobody likes as they’ve gradually neutered all the great third-party development. 
TweetDeck for Windows was perhaps the most powerful mainstream enduser social application that will everexist. Before [Twitter absorbed the tool](https://techcrunch.com/2011/05/23/twitter-buys-tweetdeck-for-40­million/) in 2011, its [diverse account integration](https://youtu.be/HQhnbrwBfSw) allowed a user to send asingle post across Facebook, LinkedIn, MySpace, Google+, and multiple Twitter accounts simultaneously,and they could configure the client to do so with just the Enter key! In retrospect, it was naive to assumethat such potent spam capabilities would continue to be entrusted to the general population withoutchallenge, but the modularity and customizability of TweetDeck prime as a standalone application made ituseful as hell and quite the power trip. Now, it exists only as a tamed, up-to-brand-guidelines [webapplication](https://tweetdeck.twitter.com), yet remains the definitive way to use Twitter on a PC if onedesires an ad-free, single-window experience if only because of its congruence with another, even moreforgotten feature of the service: *lists.* 
![TweetDeck](https://i.snap.as/lGp1lWB.png) 
This is how I’ve seen desktop Twitter since I lasted looked at my timeline in 2010. Since then, I’ve followedabout 5000 more accounts, so I’d imagine it’s a damned mess. I have a private list of my friends, which I tryto read in its entirety, and [a list of nearly 500 journalists, publications, and musicians](https://twitter.com/FickleCrux/lists/the-new) whom I’ve found particularly fresh and original. Thanks tothese, Tweets are presented in order, uninterrupted by ads. (They function the same on iOS.) The network’slinear chronology is an absolute use condition for me, so I’m thankful I completely missed the [beginning oftheir progression toward algorithmic relevance](https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/vv7g9d/twitter­is-testing-timelines-that-arent-in-chronological-order) thanks to my lists, and as I’ve since happened upondistress from mutuals and non-mutuals over [missed or stale Tweets](https://twitter.com/daniellemattoon/status/990079819202351104), I have taken the time to relay mygospel: *lists are linear*. And since promoted and sponsored Tweets began overwhelming and perturbingtimelines, I’ve seen [the displeasure](https://twitter.com/kikkujo/status/996613451349815296) andrepeated: *lists are linear and ad-free*! 
I realize how irritating it is when one plays the *why doesn’t anyone listen to me?!* card, so I’ve created a[Twitter Moment](https://twitter.com/i/moments/996616971880882176) to document the confusing silenceI’ve gotten in response to these suggestions (though I couldn’t find any cases from the past, so I may bemisremembering the extent of my charity,) and pledging to refrain from revisiting this pet advice of minewhen writing about Twitter or other social networks in the future.

# ...... for iOS Review 
#### by [David Blue](http://twitter.com/neoyokel) ![UniChar for iOS](https://i.snap.as/xTLb40e.png) 
I’ve nev­er under­stood why I nev­er see *any­one* mak­ing use of the [vast cat­a­logue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Unicode_characters) of near­ly 140,000 stan­dard Uni­code sym­bolsavail­able in their social media posts, meta­da­ta, or word art. Like replac­ing stan­dard bul­lets in our [week­lynewslet­ter](http://bit.ly/thetonearchive) with (U+25CE,) — prob­a­bly my all-time favorite, or using stringsof four char­ac­ters for intro, ad, and sta­tion iden­ti­fi­ca­tion spots on [Extra­tone Radio](http://anchor.fm/extratone). ( , for instance.) I’d like to think these uses make their expe­ri­ences feeljust a bit more unique to users — if only uncon­scious­ly — but I’d long won­dered if I was in fact the last Uni-­code enthu­si­ast alive. 
The devel­op­ment of [Jor­dan Hipwell’s UniChar for iOS](https://apple.co/2twLdBA) would sug­gest oth­er­wise.Its app store page describes it as “a pow­er­ful yet beau­ti­ful Uni­code sym­bol selec­tion app and key­board,” andits [gener­ic web­page](https://unichar.app) appears to have *tes­ti­mo­ni­als* includ­ing a *[real post](https://lifehacker.com/this-ios-keyboard-app-will-give-you-all-the-unicode-cha-1822994495)* on the WebSite *life­hack­er.* 
> UniChar is a third-par­ty iOS key­board that unlocks the wide wide world of weird Uni­code char­ac­ters. Ser-­vice marks, copy­right logos, math­e­mat­i­cal sym­bols, tech­ni­cal signs like Apple’s “splat” icon or radioac­tiv­i­tyindi­ca­tors, and more are avail­able in the stand­alone app as well as the key­board add-on you can use wher-­ev­er you need to type some­thing. 
Wow! I can’t believe I’d pull-quote *life­hack­er* any­where, but here is an iOS app that *actu­al­ly address­es*a reg­u­lar issue of my own in a beau­ti­ful and intu­itive way. I actu­al­ly can­not remem­ber the last time this hap-­pened — you’d have to give me a list and a com­pre­hen­sive refresh­er of all the ways I’ve used my iPhones inthe past ten years. 
<iframe width="auto" height="auto" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AS2S9_vBcDs?controls=0"frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"allowfullscreen></iframe> 
Con­trary to what may seem obvi­ous, UniChar’s char­ac­ter selec­tor is by far the more intu­itive and effi­cient ofthese two sep­a­rate ways to use it. Even in the free expe­ri­ence, there are sim­ply *too many* *char­ac­ters* inthe cat­a­log to rea­son­ably browse in iOS’ old extend­ed key­board. (For the record, I’d like to note that UniCharis tech­ni­cal­ly a “Ref­er­ence Appli­ca­tion,” but I under­stand if you can’t bring your­self to use the term.) Acrossboth the seam­less­ly-inter­change­able gallery and list views, the user can very quick­ly copy a char­ac­ter to theclip­board with 3D Touch, which works so well it’s as if it were meant only for this use from its begin­ning. 
In the off chance you’re a long­time lover and devout user of the grander Uni­code col­lec­tion and an iOS user,I hope you’re now expe­ri­enc­ing the same sort of pet­ty enthu­si­asm I felt myself when I dis­cov­ered it. If not, Ihope you’ll take away a desire to explore it. I mean… aren’t these smi­leys way bet­ter than any emo­ji? .... 
## Update 
Despite a hand­ful of reports of crash­ing issues in App Store reviews, Unichar has con­tin­ued to per­formadmirably for me. I end­ed up spend­ing $2.99 to unlock the full Unichar­ac­ter key­board as the tremen­dousval­ue of that num­ber for the time and effort it would save myself would be more than worth it. (Actu­al­ly, it’sthanks to Red­bub­ble for send­ing me the first tru­ly usable Inter net Mon­ey I’ve had to actu­al­ly *spend* onany apps and/or ser­vices in fuck­ing for­ev­er, but you know.) After all this time, I’m still gid­dy that [some­oneelse on Earth](https://jordanhipwell.com/) val­ues these hiero­glyphs as much as I do, and that they knewenough to man­i­fest the per­fect soft­ware to pre­serve them.

# Varmilo VA108M ![Varmilo VA108M](https://i.snap.as/Ck4ECB9t.jpeg) 
Yes, I bought a mechanical keyboard. It occurred to me that folks who spend a lot of time doing things thatrequire tools - _professionals_, artisans, craftsmen, etc. - usually seek out the best possible quality offeringsof those tools. Even if they're just 5% better than the average alternatives and cost twice as much, whenone uses them for hours every day, the last bit of refinement pays off very quickly. Considering how muchtyping I've done in the past 5-10 years, I find it a bit silly that I hadn't before thought to optimize thehardware I've used to do so. Now that I've put at least some thought into designing the space in which Iwork and [gone back to school](https://www.davidblue.wtf/college-return/), I've also invested in betteringthe thing my hands actually touch the most. 
##### Actually... Before I go on, [here is the link](https://documentcloud.adobe.com/link/review?uri=urn:aaid:scds:US:497d6e70-60df-4087-a3e5­af91077bec15https://documentcloud.adobe.com/link/review?uri=urn:aaid:scds:US:497d6e70-60df-4087­a3e5-af91077bec15) to the Varmilo VA108M User Manual/Guide/Reference in English in case that's what youcame looking for. (I had difficulty finding it, too.) 
I suppose I've let myself be blinded to the advantages of a mechanical keyboard by the _gaemer_ stigmathat surrounds them. This time, I believe I began by simply inputting something like "best keyboard fortyping" into a search engine, which returns plenty of iffy results, naturally, but among them was [a list from_Wirecutter_](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/our-favorite-mechanical-keyboards/) - whom Itrust, more or less - of "Best Mechanical Keyboards 2020." Also included were posts in the[r/MechanicalKeyboards subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/), which I _actuallyfucking joined_[^1] (but promise never to mention again outside of this post.) Uncovering my eyes, I founda ridiculously-extensive community message board and [Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/wiki), which is undoubtedly the most extensive resource onthe subject to be found, anywhere. Though I did place a time limit on myself for any research of 15 minutes,in retrospect, I suppose I also had some criteria, which I assume - if you're still reading - you might beinterested in: 
- **WIRED** as fuck. Bluetooth can _fuck off_. 
-"Full" keyboard, for the same reason I'd never spend any money on a piano with any less than 88 keys.
-At least tolerably tasteful, aesthetically. (Not overwhelmingly embarrassing if someone were to actually seeme using it.)
-Cute, ideally.
-No light shows.
-
Not "ergonomic."

-
Not from Logitech or Microsoft. 


Immediately, it was overwhelmingly clear that my choice must also have _The Cherry_... The Cherries... The"Cherry MX Switches," whatever they are. _Any_ of even the most skimmy reading up on the subject willlead you to this conclusion. That addressed, I arrived upon three considerations: the [Ducky One 2](https://www.duckychannel.com.tw/en/Ducky-One2-RGB-TKL), [Das Keyboard Model S Professional](https://www.daskeyboard.com/model-s-professional/), and [Varmilo VA87M](http://blog.piaw.net/2017/12/review-varmilo-va87m-wired-keyboard.html). 
![Varmilo VA108M (Overhead)](https://i.snap.as/Tef4WBLJ.jpg) 
*Layout of the VA108M seen from above.* 
As good as the idea of something as German as the Das Keyboard sounded, I hate the way it looks, and theDucky seemed to take itself too seriously (despite its brand name.) The VA87M seemed to be ideal if it wasfull-sized. I searched for the equivalent, [found the VA108M](http://mechanicalkeyboards.com/shop/index.php?l=product_detail&p=2855), and bought one immediately. 
Specifically...

| **Dimensions** | 5.39" x 17.41" x 1.30" |

I've already written more than I ever wanted to, but let me just say that I love everything about the thing ­the particular set of special keys, the way it feels & sounds, and that its heft prevents it from moving around
-and I hope to keep it forever. As I said on the photographs I posted to social media, **I promise to neverbring this or any other mechanical keyboard up ever again** unless asked about it. 
[1] Yes, I have actually been using the Read It website in the past 18 months or so, which anyone who’sknown me at all would find unbelievable. I don’t know if I’ll write about it in the future, so I’ll just say I’veunblocked it within my psyche largely because it’s no longer horrendous to look at. 
[2] I remain genuinely confused as to why the color of the switches matters, considering they are onlyvisible when the keycaps have been removed.

# Virtual Reality Virginity, Lost 
![VR Virgin](https://i.snap.as/4LDha0S.jpg) 
## A late geezer’s first go at the dystopian VR experience 
Earlier this year, Tim and I had the opportunity to try virtual reality at the True/False Film Festival in a dark,curtained side room of a commandeered Columbia art gallery, but we were both much too intoxicated and
loopy those last few hours of the fest, and we bailed. Call us cowards if you must — *immersion* can be a
scary concept to those of us who grew up reading science fiction, before the existence of the modern videogame console. I’ve wanted just 30 seconds or so with a pair of goggles, just to have an idea of what theincreasing number of Oculus-blinded pedestrians surrounding me are looking at. Thanks to Isiah, I was
finally caught up last night with a few VR YouTube videos and *Farpoint*’s introduction on a PlayStation 4. 
First, Isiah brings me the headset and describes in detail how exactly to adjust it, but I forget it all andsimply try to shove it directly and violently on my face. Eventually, he takes it back and simply mounts and
adjusts it around my monstrous skull — like you would for a toddler — and I lay eyes on the console for the
first time. For whatever reason, it never occurred to me that general GUI wouldn’t simply be displayed in 2D,
but by a literal *virtual display*, layed out in front of me like a large, floor-mounted touch workstation. I’mastonished by my ability to turn away from it to look at the rest of *Goggleworld*, which is nothing but a
deeply black void. 
From my previous world, I hear Isiah and Hawthorn discussing what to show me first, and YouTube is the
settled-upon environment. As the application is restarted in “VR Mode,” its startup screen is what *really*establishes the truth — I have *gone virtual*. I cannot use my hands to shield my eyes from the branding’s
glaring watermark and terrifying red light. At its home menu, Isiah simply selects the “VR” tab, revealing aselection of thumbnails for algorithmically-recommended VR-shot videos on the service. 
To begin, I am mounted on the tail of a superbike as it’s raced around an American desert circuit. It takes afew seconds for high resolution to buffer, leaving me briefly in a pixelized hell that would surely makeanyone sick, were they exposed very long. (I was especially excited to become nauseous, to no avail.) At thegetgo, I am occupied with the rider’s butt since it’s center-frame if I stand in my usual posture. Isiah pointsout the hovering HUD to my left containing a selection of simulated digital instruments (tachometer, 7­segment speedo, etc.) Its presence would suggest that the purpose of my virtual passengership is to witness
the lap as a motorsport enthusiast, but the rear of the rider obscures most of my view forward — I cannotadmire his line as one would viewing a GoPro-or-otherwise POV of the same event, so I decide to try and
figure out which track I am hurried through. Though the vehicle is tossed about in the required movementsof motorbike operation, I myself (the VR capture device) am impressively gyrostabilized, and the image,
static, as if I’m *actually* hovering above the pair as they moved along. I spin left and right, spotting a small
gaggle of miniature wind turbines and two wilting hilltop trees in the foreground. Behind them, small sanddunes fill the space, all the way to the horizon. 
After a few minutes, I am finally relieved early of my cutless lap for a short *National Geographic*documentary on a Viking revival festival in Poland. I’m introduced to its Big Boys by a series of aerial shots
(presumably by drone, which is awfully un-Vikinglike) as they row their Big Boat up(?) a relatively wide, tree-
lined river. In contrast with the lap, the jump cuts become a bit disorienting — I am eventually jumped *in*the boat for a moment, next to the sweaty, bearded lads — a few of whom are shirtless. I notice a blurry
church on the distant bank. Suddenly, I float briskly across the small no man’s land between two rapidly
advancing battle lines of Nordic Nerds with real, era-specific weapons and way too much free time. More
lingering drone shots follow from just a few feet above the ensuing conflict. Outside, Isiah confirms
Hawthorn’s suggestion that this is, indeed, *the one where they use real weapons* as I notice a pile of three
or four men lying against each other, motionless on the ground, right-of-center in the nearest line, and mullover the sure disturbance of all this immersion the festival has allowed in welcoming the presence of the
surely-buzzing drone. *I guess they’re dead*. 
After the conflict, I am subjected to a dreamier, narrated montage accompanied by cheesy synthesized orchestral music and featuring disproportionately a particular man with a shiny, tatted bald head and ratherlarge feet with rather small toes, which he likes to wiggle during these particular conversations. Thanks toVR’s omniencompassing perspective, I am allowed to observe his wiggling in his every appearance. The toneof the background music and the prevalence of relaxed, conversing couples and sunsets in the scenes
suggest romanticism is the montage’s theme, but for me, it is the bald man’s feet — I am too busy conversing
with my two friends, across the divide, in this world, to listen to any of what is said. Considering thatYouTube collects the dimensional data regarding where the user looks, and for how long, I make an effort tobend my neck up and down in extremes, and notice a patch of washed-out sky, distorting in the distance,
and ponder what — if anything — we have gained in this technology. 
![VR Vertical](https://i.snap.as/ihtaDMF.jpg) 
Does an increase in the raw amount of visual data available to the viewer actually make motion picture
storytelling more effective? In the few minutes of my VR taste test, I *did* gain quite a bit of volition over
an equivalent 2D experience, but it didn’t seem like I’d instinctively used it to gain much else. If one isspecifically interested in the shrubbery around a racetrack, or the more nuanced undulations of a Viking’sfoot, they can more likely than not find a standard video on the World Wide Web that would more efficientlyentertain them. In specific situations, of course, a producer can undoubtedly benefit by the ability to capture
in 360 degrees, but — in any sort of cinema, especially — it seems unnecessarily sacrificial to relinquish
entirely the narrative directorial control of shot framing to their audience. However, I am the antiexpert on
this subject, obviously. My take on the viability of VR is Virtually Redundant and — quite possibly — very
wrong, but my time in its hell is not over yet. 
Isiah explains that it is time for me to *game*, and asks if I’d like to try “the one with the hands, or the one
with the gun.” As always, I choose the firearm, as the “hands” have not been found yet and the hypotheticalimage immediately offered up by my imagination is of rusty iron shackles. The Infinite Blackness has
returned, and I cannot see beyond it to determine what my host is up to. Then, it becomes outer space —filling with thousands of starlike white dots. The light-blue outline of a virtual PlayStation controller appears
where I assume him to be, unattached and bumbling about. Soon, it jaggedly approaches, and I feel himhand it to me. We have started its calibration process, which becomes a bit frightening in my celestialsurroundings, though at least I have now gained participatory power over my new existence. I’d opted out ofwearing headphones, so the assistant’s malignant-sounding female British voice comes softly from thetelevision somewhere in front of me as I point the beam of light the controller’s representation is nowprojecting straight forward at the navigational arrows displayed ahead and pull “the trigger” (R2.) 
I am pleased by the idea of interfacing with software exclusively by shooting it repeatedly before I amabruptly contained in a cage, now being projected by a virtualization of the system’s sensor, which isunsettling. I am now calibrating the hardware contained within the physical device that captures the positionof my body in the physical world. I catch the word “confinement” in the assistant’s unending, otherwise-inaudible directions, and quicken my pace. When it’s all done, I return the controller to Isiah, who reboots
the PS4, itself, before launching *Farpoint*. My space becomes a lighter blue and fills with little opaque bits
of Sony Dust for a minute or two. Isiah continues his rummaging for another peripheral as the title’sintroduction begins to play. 
Two rather poorly-animated astronauts are co-hosting a live broadcast from their craft, which is presented ina dramatization of a computer display. They’ve just met, but they’re both stacked with academia, co-massaging their knowledge, which I choose not to listen to. Out of view, Isiah unsuccessfully attempts to
skip the whole thing before I’m allowed to become *virtual* again — this time, atop the animated body ofanother astronaut in a lone shuttle, approaching the mothership where it holds, next to a large, very-*StarTrek* “anomaly.” From Deep Space Nine, the two scientists continue to bicker over comms as I look aroundthe cockpit. Looking backwards has already become a favorite habit of mine — I wonder where the shuttle’s
bathroom is. For whatever reason, the back of my character’s neck was animated, though it can only beseen by looking rearwards and down, which distorts its shape into something truly terrifying. 
A bunch of unrelated plot follows, leading me to end up on a foreign world, exiting my crashed escape pod.
By now, Isiah has connected *The Gun*, but something about it isn’t quite right — my character holds it in a
glitched, very uncomfortable-looking manner, and it’s suspected that a fix would require a restart, and 
therefore — a replay of the introductory cutscene — so I retire out of lack of patience. 
If I were confidently reviewing PlayStation VR as a consumer purchase, I’d cite a quote of Isiah’s: “I couldn’t
find the thing.” In addition to my first drone sighting, a few days ago in Colorado, this lost virtual virginity is
not necessarily unwelcome — I feel as though I’ve acquired a platform to better ponder the dystopia to which
these and their like industries add a certain comic spice. That said, I cannot imagine a reason to once again
enter the digital realm — and *who cares*? 
Please enjoy your new worlds, kids.

# Kinship of the Jetta, Deserving ![Mk VII and Mk VI](https://i.snap.as/qW5VDLj.jpg) 
Though I grew up on a farm surrounded by (and loving) diesel equipment, owning a diesel-poweredautomobile somehow never occurred to me. This is especially puzzling given the overwhelmingly positiveexperience I was privileged to have with one 2014 Volkswagen Jetta TDI Sportwagen over the past year. Itwould find me signing up to Facebook groups, using real Fast Boy terms, revisiting long-lost roads of home,and returning to my local community in an extremely intimate ridesharing stint. Throughout it all, the Jettamade me smile much *much* more than I would’ve thought. I found a real love for this relatively simpletonform of transportation that I *should* have seen coming, but did not at all. There is something delightfullyindulgent about a manual-equipped diesel wagon. Even [*The New York Times*](https://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/20/automobiles/autoreviews/diesel-wagon-whatll-they-think-of­next.html) knows this: 
> Auto writers have long tooted the horn about the benefits of diesel engines, and a bunch of them havealso argued that the old-school station wagon is a far more efficient way to haul things around than abloated high-set S.U.V. 
I knew it, too, apparently, long before I actually decided to act on a purchase. On October 24th, 2012, ITweeted “[I sat in a Jetta wagon today. I need one](https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/261163556073005056).” I really did intend on becoming The Jetta Man(perhaps without the fashion.) In acquiring it, my plan - and it was a good plan - was to cease an era ofgeneral insensibility in my life's decisions by entombing my wayward self within the most sensible expressionof modern automotive design I suspected I could live with. The wagon component joined with diesel powerand a manual transmission upon casual research. Diesel, manual, wagon - of the people's car, these Isought. Nay, *demanded*. 
An ex-girlfriend of mine drove an utterly decimated Mk. V Jetta Sedan which she’d acquired in some sort ofdicey deal. I remember finding it surprisingly robust given its lot, and quite dynamic to drive. We traveled allover the Midwest in it – from central Missouri to Des Moines to Chicago to Kansas City and back again. Imocked, but it was everything one could hope for in cheap transportation and quite a bit more. It turns out,Volkswagen was shooting high. As Tony Quiroga [recalls for *Car & Driver*](https://www.caranddriver.com/reviews/a15129377/volkswagen-jetta-review-2011-volkswagen-jetta-first­drive/): 
> During the press launch of the outgoing Jetta back in 2005, Volkswagen touted that car as a lessexpensive alternative to an Acura TSX or Volvo S40. Volkswagen pointed to its growth in size, high-qualityinterior, new rear suspension, and refined demeanor as evidence that the Jetta had moved out of the HondaCivic and Toyota Corolla class. 
In terms of **premium** compacts, my experience is quite limited, but it’s no wonder the company hasstruggled to find a place in the market for this product: in German, “Volkswagen Jetta” literally means“[people’s car jet stream](https://www.roadandtrack.com/car-culture/a24487598/volkswagen-golf-jetta­passat-polo-name-origin/).” The first component is infamous, of course, because of the Nazis and their[horrid Beetle](https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/volkswagen-is-founded), but the second seemsto be almost entirely unknown. In my research, I had to specifically investigate the Jetta’s name beforereading anything about it. When an American thinks of “Jetta,” they unconsciously dissociate the word fromthe “jet” sound and make [largely unsophisticated jokes](https://carstereotypes.com/car­stereotypes/volkswagen-jetta-stereotypes/). (It’s also *Regular Car Reviews*’ [most hated car](https://youtu.be/2KZb545b4MU).) Now, the name has become a marque in and of itself: in China,Volkswagen [began selling several different models](https://www.volkswagen-newsroom.com/en/press­releases/jetta-brand-successfully-launched-in-chinese-market-5647) under the JETTA brand last year. Thisalso was news to me, and *I* try to keep up with the industry. 
In 2011, the Mk. VI Jetta was [released](https://www.motortrend.com/cars/volkswagen/jetta/2011/2011­
volkswagen-jetta/) with an outdated base, 115-hp powertrain and a “hard plastic [interior] that wouldn’t lookout of place in a Chrysler Sebring.” (Quiroga insults, to clarify.) Compared to the Mk. V, “Volkswagen made itclear that the targets are once again the strong-selling Civic and Corolla.” Once again, I’m at a loss forexperience in the equivalent extra-Volkswagen competition, save for the [Chevrolet Cruze](https://youtu.be/40x4TF-6ggc) and Kia Forte. (Surprisingly, GM actually produced a diesel version of theCruze and [*AutoGuide* compared it against the Jetta TDI](https://youtu.be/dH-FZyKTY3s).) It’s been toolong since I last drove my ex’s Mk. V to really have much to say, but I do remember a particular solidityabout the steering – perhaps because it was still hydraulic. Once again, I’ll rely on Tony: 
> Less obvious cost cutting includes the loss of adjustability for the center armrest, a lack of lumbaradjustment in most models, no more power-reclining seatbacks, and a simpler stability-control program thatcan no longer be shut off or even reduced. 
When I began searching for my first ever truly modern car in February 2019, I surprisingly only needed topass up a single option in the Kansas City area before I found The One: a 2014 post-[Dieselgate](https://youtu.be/SvokGhOaHGg) example with ~65,000 miles on its odometer in “Deep Black Pearl” with a“Cornsilk Beige” interior which had been previously owned only by a single Michigan cyclist. I’d been withouta car since dailying/living in a [1976 Lincoln Continental](https://www.instagram.com/p/BiYABpKAJQX) theyear before, in Portland, and my friend had driven me around everywhere in his Wrangler for a full month(thanks, Jack!) I’d walked around and cold-idled another, high-mileage Sportwagen, but I was committed togetting something with a light-colored interior after the red velvet cake Lincoln and my dank smoking room-dark XJR. 
![Martin Racing](https://i.snap.as/HRE2hlh.jpg) 
Three of us walked into a dealership in the middle of a frigid Kansas afternoon – Jack, my girlfriend Sierra,and I. We hovered by a smart, gleaming little Golf GTI whilst my salesman, Charles, retrieved the car I hadfound online. After he finished copying my driver’s license while the little diesel warmed up, the four of usset off into suburban Lawrence. Back when the Mk. VI Golf was released, I attended a Volkswagendealership event in which Mk. V and Mk. VI GTIs were driven back-to-back – I’m assuming to reassurebuyers that yes, they *really had* made it better (though I was quite vocal in my disagreement about this,to the dealer’s chagrin.) The car I bought immediately reminded me more of the former – perhaps I justenjoy the increased body roll of a 50,000+ mile suspension – albeit with a much longer wheelbase andsignificantly more torque. Rowing through the gears, I was immediately impressed and bewildered by thecharacteristics of the 140-horsepower, 236 lb.-ft.-developing diesel powerplant. The diesel engines I grew uparound in tractors, combines, and other heavy machinery were designed to more or less remain at aconstant, relatively low RPM for the majority of their use cases. It’s not a screamer, but the idea that a dieselengine can *rev* at all was something that took a bit to wrap my head around. However, it is almostimmediately evident that carrying on to the 6000 RPM (?) redline is a futile and incorrect practice. There isnothing at all to be found up there. 
I’ve driven some quick straight-line cars in my time, but none of them have delivered their power anythinglike the Jetta’s long-distinguished 2.0L inline-four. It’s very odd having comparatively so little actualhorsepower, yet so much torque – I’d heard Jeremy Clarkson complain about diesel power coming in “greatlumps,” but I’d already started to find them extremely (and positively) amusing in my first few minutes.When asked, the oil burner will produce protracted front tire squeal and torque steer from a stop, which isodd and hilarious coming from such an otherwise docile automobile. Also hilarious: Charles likely noted thatJack, Sierra, and I were (and are) entirely unafraid of facing The End when a very near collision during ourtest drive did not perturb us in the least, but left him huffing and puffing from adrenaline. He was a star,though, throughout the more than four hours of deliberations required for his institution to reckon with mycredit history. Eventually, I ended up spending almost exactly $12,000, which was probably too much, andnamed my new automobile Martin - "Marty" for short - after Martin Winterkorn, the former CEO ofVolkswagen AG who [bore more than his share of the blame](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-05-03/ex-vw-ceo-winterkorn-charged-by-u-s-in-diesel­cheating-case) for Dieselgate, including [charges of fraud](https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/16/18369528/vw-ceo-martin-winterkorn-dieselgate-germany­volkswagen-emissions-scandal) by the German government. *Dirty diesel rolling coal in prison*. 
## Naughty Diesel 
By "post-Dieselgate," I mean that my new car was a part of [Volkwagen's $10 billion buyback program](https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a15344947/whats-volkswagen-doing-with-all-those-repurchased­diesels/), so the Michigander sold it back to the manufacturer for its "fair replacement value" - [between$12,500 and $44,000](https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a15347930/volkswagen-settles-diesel-emissions­violations-for-14-7-billion-even-more-fines-to-come/) according to *Car & Driver* on behalf of FTCchairwoman Edith Ramirez. To be technical, the powerplant is a 2.0L [EA189/CJAA](https://www.motorreviewer.com/engine.php?engine_id=43) turbodiesel four-cylinder. “The EA 189 was oneof the most important engines in the company, destined not only for millions of Volkswagen-brand cars butalso for a wide variety of other brands from the parent Volkswagen Group, like Audi, Skoda and Seat, as wellas some light utility vehicles,” said [*The New York Times*](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/05/business/engine-shortfall-pushed-volkswagen-to-evade-emissions­testing.html) regarding the “clean diesel” “scheme.” In original spec, 236 lb.-ft. of it arrived between 1750­2800 RPM, but my (admittedly, unscientific) perception indicates that post-update, the torque was coming abit later. If I thought you were interested, I would attempt to detail [exactly what my car was then subjectedto](https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a15351089/volkswagen-details-fix-for-ea189-diesel-in-europe-but­itll-be-more-complex-for-u-s) by a dealer, but suffice it to say that it was made less fuel efficient and a bitless powerful, to my displeasure. For a complete and comprehensive video on the scandal, try [*Regular CarReviews*](https://youtu.be/SvokGhOaHGg). I’d also recommend the following reading from [*Jalopnik*](https://jalopnik.com/your-guide-to-dieselgate-volkswagens-diesel-cheating-c-1731857018), [*The Verge*](https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/2/17928314/audi-ceo-rupert-stadler-fired-volkswagen-dieselgate),[*The New York Times*](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/15/business/winterkorn-volkswagen-emissions­scandal.html), and [*The Independent*](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/volkswagen­ceo-martin-winterkorn-fraud-charges-germany-a8870541.html). 
![Martin and Locomotive](https://i.snap.as/jfgT5Qu.jpg) 
My own views on Dieselgate are entirely irrelevant, but I will note that buying back a buyback car for such aprice felt like a favor to my dealer and that it’s pretty cool to have my own copy of [VW’s Extended EmissionsWarranty Notice](https://www.vwdiesellookup.com/pdf/VWCourtSettlement_Emissions_Disclosure_Gen2_Automatic_Final.pdf), not to mention the fact that I actually made use of it (which I will discuss later.) From my perspective, theautomotive industry is *the* most heavily-regulated business space in the world and I’d suggest a companylike the Volkswagen Group feeling like they should cheat on emissions testing might indicate that thestandards of the test could be unreasonable and/or unrealistic. 
After returning from almost two hellish, extremely confusing years in Portland taking public transport, Martinbecame a vehicle for a rediscovery and newfound appreciation for my Missouri home – the great MissouriRiver, especially. Not since owning my Miata had I driven so much in the country. Sierra and I [visitedCooper’s Landing](https://www.instagram.com/p/BuP3y62laon/) in the wet and ventured down toSpringfield, Missouri (very far South,) near which we discovered [Hodges Speedway](https://dieselgoth.com/race-day-at-hodges) – a [then-abandoned dirt oval](https://www.facebook.com/AsphaltApostle/videos/10218812861450693) surrounded by demolition derbycasualties and the large trucks used to haul them around. 
![Martin Hiding](https://i.snap.as/Yjq0MbT.jpg) 
Somewhere North of Kansas City, I opened the taps all the way on a very long straight and reached125mph, which is either the aerodynamic VMax, an electronically limited limit, or both. Surprisingly, themodern People’s Car feels quite stable at this speed – were it not my own automobile, I’m not sure Iwouldn’t just travel this fast everywhere. In the past few years, Interstate 70 – which cuts Missouri justabout in half from West-East, connecting St. Louis and Kansas City with my hometown in the center – hasbecome significantly faster-paced than I remembered it before moving to Portland for two years. 80mphused to be the accepted number, 70 (the actual speed limit) was the unenforced minimum. In my old Toyotapickup, I could travel at 65 without attracting too much criticism. *Now*, however, one must maintain 85 to keep up with traffic, especially when traveling with commuters. 90-95 will no longer garner judgmental looksand 100mph left-laners are given a pass. 
“I’ll bet that’s great on the highway” is probably the most regular comment received from passersby andriders right after “is this a diesel!?” (Really, the fact of my Jetta’s existence as a manual-equipped dieselwagon seemed to utterly astound a great many people.) There is truth in this general supposition: the abilityof the diesel powerplant to deliver hill-climbing torque at low RPM is simply unmatched by gasolinepowerplants of the same displacement, which means that “highway” driving entails virtually zerodownshifting – arrive in sixth gear, set the cruise control, take a nap. Everything else is taken care of. Thereis a definite luxury in the knowledge that one is no longer needed in the process at speed – luxury that isNOT present in a gasoline-to-manual Jetta drivetrain. From [*Hackaday*](https://hackaday.com/2019/09/26/the-future-of-diesel-is-on-shaky-ground/): 
> [Diesel] has a higher volumetric energy density than gasoline, and thanks to low volatility, diesel enginescan run at significantly higher compression ratios without risking detonation. These benefits allow dieselengines to produce significantly more torque than similarly sized gasoline engines. 
![Fat Martin](https://i.snap.as/58ZyiRO.jpg) 
“Diesel engines are typically poor when it comes to power to weight ratio, as their high compression ratioand torque output demands heavier materials in their construction,” notes Lewin Day, meaning *steel*engine block. Here we arrive on my singular dissatisfaction with the Jetta: **its weight**. While travelingfrom Kansas City back home in the East one day, I decided to satisfy a longtime bucketlist item and stop bya weigh station. As I drove up to the scale, the police-uniformed attendant looked up at me from his glassbox and gave [the standard white guy smile frown](https://twitter.com/rashadpls/status/650114296937058304). It took a moment for the scale to registerMartin, but it eventually displayed a whole **3440** **lbs**. My little “compact” wagon… weighedsignificantly more than one and three-quarter tons – just 528 lbs. less than the [full-sized, supercharged V8­powered Jaguar saloon car](https://www.instagram.com/p/BJPe6rWAcnr/) I call the automotive love of mylife, and almost a full 200 lbs. more than [its GLI sedan sibling](https://www.caranddriver.com/reviews/a15129379/2011-volkswagen-jetta-gli-20-tsi-review/). There wasone single advantage to this weight: we were able to use Martin as a ballast to help [re-spool the winchcable on Jack’s Wrangler](https://www.instagram.com/tv/BwBEetwlUEF). 
After discovering this figure, I did what I could to diminish the weight easily without tearing into the seats orremoving some of the car’s *fourteen* airbags. Upon lifting up the base of the “car-go” area in the rear, Ifound a *full* steel spare wheel – some 30 lbs of it at least – which I immediately removed, along with somesort of flapping cargo restraint that I can only suspect was designed to keep objects (like dogs, perhaps) inthe cargo area from sailing into the passenger compartment during an accident (it’s called the “luggagecompartment cover” in the [owner’s manual](https://eileenlong­my.sharepoint.com/:b:/g/personal/david_eileenlonglcsw_com/Ecdms0tdr6dBoMWScrKX8PsBkIJMmYNjOfzFX3oy-UUO-A).) Ideally, I intended to one day strip out all of the interior except for the driver’s side chair, but it‘twas not intended to be. 
After driving the Jetta for about a week, I was on the short commute back home from the office when Inoticed that the cooling fans were running at what sounded like maximum capacity. Then, at a red light, Ifelt some rough dips in the engine’s idle. When I reached home minutes later, I turned off the ignition andremoved the key only to find the fans still spooling. I was convinced I had already broken the car somehowin rough driving, but in reality, Marty was in the process of [Diesel Particulate Filter (DPF) Regeneration](https://dieselnet.com/tech/dpf_regen.php) – a procedure designed to clean the little shitpot under the hoodby heating it up some thousands of degrees to burn off built up diesel exhaust soot. At least, this is the wayI understand it. 
Otherwise, I disagree with most reviews about the “diesel rumble” being bothersome. Perhaps it’s becausethis is by far the most modern car I’ve ever spent this much time with – the *only* car I’ve ever spent somuch consecutive time with, in fact – or because I did, indeed, grow up sitting (and standing) right next to8-liter turbodiesels at full chat for hours on end. Compared to my mother’s 1.4L gasoline-powered Mk. VII 
sedan at idle in her garage, there is a more pronounced clacking, but it’s nothing you’d have any troublesleeping through. I would know! Whilst driving for Uber and Lyft through one of the [warmest summers onrecord](https://www.therolladailynews.com/news/20190926/second-hottest-august-ever-wettest-january-to­august-on-record), I idled away many hours parked on the street with the (averagely effective) air-conditioning on. I idled when I wasn’t online, too – I would even go as far as to say that I made idling one ofthe trendiest activities of Summer 2019. 
> What’re you up to man?> Nothin’ much yo. Just over here idling. 
## Ridesharing 
For more than six months, my primary income was from Uber and Lyft driving around Columbia, MO – adistinctly academically-dominated demographic. Frankly, I can’t think of any vehicle more suited to whatridesharing actually entails than a diesel Jetta wagon. It’s a relatively spacious and comfortable place to befor four adults – certainly when no trip lasts longer than thirty minutes – with a ridiculously stout cargocapacity. I was able to fit *9* freshman fraternity guys in for a short trip once. Their faces were all genuinelysomber as one expressed “it’s really hard having 8 friends when we try to go out.” (No, you’re not supposedto accept those rides.) It was a challenge carrying some 1500 lbs. of Sad Boys, mostly for the brakes. Once,a group of young men and women began to make fun after noticing the DIESELGEEK decal I’d stuck on myside’s rear quarter window (which I’d acquired with a new [shifter bushing kit](https://www.dieselgeek.com/products/high-performance-vw-shifter-shaft-bushings-for-mk4-golf-jetta-new­beetle?variant=6292541866027).) “So are you a diesel geek?” they asked, jeering to themselves, to which Iresponded: “you know, it’s so weird you mention that because I know this place that sells these stickers…”They no longer seemed amused. 
All of the cars I’ve owned have been attention-grabbing in their own way – my old Toyota pickup wasadored by the locals; my Miata was adored by other Miata owners. My XJR was gorgeous and my SwampContinental seemed to be passionately coveted by absolutely everyone over 40. With the Jetta, though, I didnot expect any unusual attention whatsoever, yet I must confess that more conversations were startedabout it than of all of the others, combined. Ridesharing will do that, yes, but it is ridiculous how manypeople of all races, classes, and ages were enamored by – or overly curious about – Martin. 
> What is this a Jetta, dude? Is this a Jetta? Whoa! Dude, is this a stickshift!? Dude I think this is astickshift. BRO. I can’t believe you’re driving a stick right now. He’s driving a stickshift car! Wow I think thisis a manual car! Oh shit this is a **diesel**!? It’s a diesel too?! No way! I can’t believe you’re out heredriving a diesel Jetta wagon bro. Is this a stickshift? You can drive stick!? 
No. 
Early one morning, a ride was requested from the local news station just out of town – a fascinating place.News vans parked in a converted horse stable. They farm televisions out there. A few minutes into the ride,after picking up the young woman, I noticed in the rearview mirror out of my eye’s corner that she had putdown her phone to watch my right hand with total bewilderment. Eventually, she asked “what are you doingto the car?” She’d never heard of a manual transmission before. I did my best to explain, but when sheasked “but why wouldn’t you just buy a regular car?” I did not have a sufficient answer. Unlike manyautomotive enthusiasts, I think it’s totally okay that people are allowed to exist independent of thisknowledge. There are many, many other things in life to worry about. [80% of cars sold in the UnitedStates](https://dieselgoth.com/automatic-transmission-inefficiency) are shipped with automatics andexpecting every young person who lives in an urban environment to think about automobiles as anythingbeyond simple transportation is asking a lot. 
While we’re on the topic of manual transmissions, it’s relevant to mention how excellent the Jetta TDI is as avehicle to teach first timers how to operate one. With the clutch in, the engine will not rev beyond 3500 RPMthanks to an electronic limiter, which dramatically reduces the number of obligatory stalls when learningclutch control. The learner can simply hold the accelerator to the floor as they get the hang of declutchinginstead of having to receive shouts of “more gas!” repeatedly. Of course, being a diesel further eases those 
stresses with much more readily available torque. Sierra was able to grasp the basics this way in a *singlenight*, which is unprecedented in my experience. She found particular comfort in the suggested gearindicator on the instrument panel’s main information display, which is very conservative, naturally, but alsoapparently relief from some great anxiety regarding the question *which gear should I be in right now*? 
## Community 
I have derided Facebook for my entire adult life for its shitty design, inaspirational effect on its users, and itsmassive intellectual power, but strangely, through Jetta ownership, I was able to find a community on theservice that couldn’t be found elsewhere. Groups like [TDI Scumbags](https://www.facebook.com/groups/173989949914106), [VW TDI Owners](https://www.facebook.com/groups/24097854515), [VW TDI support group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/1088169071220271), and [VW TDI Owners Performance and Tech Talk](https://www.facebook.com/groups/2501785479863909) are full of absolutely hilarious and insightfulcontent that I’m genuinely glad I didn’t miss.

On Instagram, I found [@jp_eurogarage’s Mk. IV diesel sportwagen](https://www.instagram.com/p/B52_ViunyoH/), which I adore. I especially love [its idle](https://www.instagram.com/p/Bp-LXMbFNza/). @projectownersclub [posted a video](https://www.instagram.com/p/BrddAqWHpBZ/) in December, 2018 of a *very* rusty diesel Mk.

A video was shared on one of my Facebookgroups captioned “[when you only drive manual](https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=448084355761412)”in which a very generic-looking white man with moustache finds himself gagging in a car with a traditionalautomatic transmission. The wholesomeness of these posts is often adorable, and not only on Facebook.[*VW Vortex*](https://www.vwvortex.com) is an active and helpful forum/blog for TDI owners that I foundto be invaluable when researching modifications.

## Performance 
For the first time in my personal automotive history, I felt the desire to modify one of my own cars. Perhapsthe most famous appearance of the Jetta Sportwagen in The Web Era was driving instructor Austin Cabot’s2014 Sportwagen in [one of Matt Farah’s infamous *One-Take*s](https://youtu.be/x3HwWn55MJY). You canfind the full list of modifications on [the car’s *WheelWell* page](https://www.wheelwell.com/austin­cabot/im7/2014-volkswagen-jetta-sportwagen). I intended to emulate Austin with a few modificationsincluding Dieselgeek’s [Sigma 6 shortshift kit](https://www.dieselgeek.com/collections/vw-short­shifters/products/sigma-6-six-speed-short-shift-kit-for-vw) and “high performance” [shifter bushing kit](https://www.dieselgeek.com/products/high-performance-vw-shifter-shaft-bushings-for-mk4-golf-jetta-new­beetle?variant=6292541866027) (which I did get around to buying, but never installed.) For those interestedin engine/ECU tuning, Malone Tuning has a [beautiful tool](https://malonetuning.com/ecu­tuning/VW/2014/Jetta/2.0L-CR-TDI-CJAA-EA189-2012-2014/Stock) to help you customize your order. 
![Malone Tuning Stage 2](https://i.snap.as/uApnhy4.png) 
Instead of installing the shortshift kit right away, I decided to splurge on a bespoke [Raceseng Ashikoweighted shift knob](https://www.ecstuning.com/b-raceseng-parts/ashiko-shift-knob-red-texture-no­engraving-vw-audi-adapter/08311421~rsg), which made throws immediately better. The issue theseproducts are combatting is the particularly disconnected gearshift which Volkswagen has been notorious forthe past few decades. The best way I can describe it is that it feels like you’re just operating a lever insteadof shifting a transmission, if that makes sense. 
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">got that <ahref="https://twitter.com/raceseng?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@raceseng</a> knob. feels immensely bettereven pre-short shift kit. I’m very impressed. <ahref="https://t.co/Yvb4LzUXG2">pic.twitter.com/Yvb4LzUXG2</a></p>&mdash; David Blue (@NeoYokel)<a href="https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/1181687967066144768?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 8,2019</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script> 
The knob itself is beautifully machined and extremely satisfying to hold. I also “[deleted](https://www.instagram.com/tv/ByJ3-u4luhV65nfvVjZ94z00WOTjImro12LtXw0/)” (removed, in other words)the (likely) faux-leather shift boot after realizing that I’ve always hated the sound and sensation of them, buthadn’t been willing to modify my previous cars in *any* way. It sounds ridiculous, but it’s actually quitepersonally noteworthy that I was able to traverse the unseen boundary into *mod culture*. The result was aslightly more mechanical-feeling shift that would’ve certainly been [vastly improved](https://youtu.be/Rh02yxy9SbE) by installation of Dieselgeek’s kit.

Another aspirational goal of mine for Martin: [H&R’s Sport Springs Set](https://www.ecstuning.com/b-h-and­r-parts/sport-springs-set/54751/) paired with a set of [Firestone Firehawk Indy 500s](https://www.tirerack.com/tires/tires.jsp?tireMake=Firestone&tireModel=Firehawk+Indy+500&partnum=055WR6FHI5&autoMake=Volkswagen&autoM 
odel=Jetta+Sportwagen&autoYear=2014&autoModClar=TDI). The goal was to sure up some of that bodyroll and torque-induced wheelspin. I suspect the result would’ve been a very, very sticky Martin.Unfortunately, I would not get the chance before I killed him in an accident on December 22nd of last year. 
### Efficiency 
Average: **29.84** mpgTotal Gallons Pumped: **644**Total Spent: $**1726.94**Total Miles Driven: **19506** 
According to my [fuel logs](https://eileenlong­my.sharepoint.com/:x:/g/personal/david_eileenlonglcsw_com/EbMIF1pW62JDu3pb4NnCzZoBg_FWIzo_Z48lyGM9oi-VSA), (they are public, yes, though not necessarily 100% complete,) I averaged close to 30 mpg over78 fillups and just over 19500 miles. Considering that I was ridesharing most of that time and driving quiteobnoxiously for all of it, you should be very impressed. “Diesels tend to get about 30-percent better fueleconomy than their conventional counterparts,” says *Consumer Reports* in a [comparison between dieselsand hybrids](https://www.consumerreports.org/cro/news/2013/10/diesel-offer-great-highway-fuel­economy/index.htm) dating back to 2013. From the [*Union of Concerned Scientists*](https://blog.ucsusa.org/dave-cooke/diesel-vs-hybrid-cost-benefits-410): 
> Much of the reason for diesel vehicle’s high fuel economy has to do with the diesel combustion process;however, some of the increase in fuel economy is due to the simple fact that a gallon of diesel fuel containsmore energy than a gallon of gasoline. 
The joy my Sportwagen brought me was not expected. My plan to make myself a more reasonable person(and driver) by buying a “boring” car was obviously foiled by the diesel’s torque, the community’s dynamism,and my own communion with mod culture. I spent more consecutive time driving the Jetta than I have inany other automobile and was able to truly enjoy it. After my experience owning a diesel-poweredVolkswagen, I would very much like to try driving/owning the [Golf GDI](https://www.topgear.com/car­reviews/volkswagen/golfgolf-sv/20-tdi-184-gtd-5dr/first-drive) – a performance-oriented diesel version oftheir excellent hatch. Truthfully – given the way I killed Martin – I did not deserve his kinship, but I’mcertainly grateful I had the experience.

# The White Island 
![The White Island](https://i.snap.as/XKiEDGD.jpg) 
*Everything you’ve ever heard or read about Portland, Oregon is true. It is an authoritative andpseudofascist money machine that hides behind an insultingly thin veneer of celebrated individualism. Theseare the sentiments I see reflected in the people and organizations around me. I originally [posted this onr/Portland](https://www.reddit.com/r/Portland/comments/8jzr8m/the_white_island/) and it made whitepeople mad.* 
In my despair about the complex nature of the World as it is changing, I shall create for myself and thoselike me an Island where the things about us which I think should be celebrated can be so freely — where Me(among us) means something again. Where our money will mean something again because meaning is —above all — what people like me should seek. I write this prospectus for my Island — let’s call it White Island— on a thirty-year-old typewriter because the physicality of these words is almost the entirety of whatimbues them with meaning, and I believe the particulars of analog existence are lost on the World in atragically big way as it is changing. On White Island, at least, the physical shall be most Holy, and its intrinsicworth shall be worshiped freely so that the treasures of our past are not lost. 
As it is changing, the World is growing noisy with voices that are unlike mine, and the grasp on theconversation which I was promised in my upbringing is slipping alarmingly away with each new day. Ibelieve these new sounds detract from my celebration of the things in life that give mine meaning: bicycles,beanies, body art, brewing, electric guitars, and the hair that grows on my face. Every day, I am more andmore afraid that my voice will be lost in them, and if it is lost, I am afraid there will be nothing left of Me ormy meaning. This thought worries me like none other, and — as long as people like me have sufficienteconomic and social resources to do so — we should make for ourselves an Island away from the new Worldand her noises so that we may continue to live comfortably in a soundscape of only our own creation, as isour birthright and grand tradition. 
Our parents and their parents before them were born into a more careful and physical World where respectfor their crafts, their voices, and their beards was a universal right. If we are to follow in their generousfootsteps and give wholeheartedly our own equivalent of these to the World, we should be unequivocal inour expectation of its continued reciprocation and appreciation for them. As long as we are able, we shouldnot have to imagine an alternative way of life in which our effort is less recognized or generally important.This we should refrain from doing not only for the sake of our own comfort, but for the good of the wholeWorld, even if it is no longer interested in recognizing the value of our contributions to it. 
As our trusted methodologies are washed away in their new noise, our Island shall be a bastion for them.We will remember that a cup of coffee should take at least twenty minutes to prepare. We will not forget theculturalizing nuances in the taste of the most diminutive brews. We will sacrifice whatever is necessary inorder to purify our foods from the poisonous nutritional sins of the processed masses. We shall enforce ourown wise, time-honored priorities as we can only within a space that is truly ours, where only people likeourselves will feel and be sincerely welcome.

# Lotus SmartSuite and the year 2000 
![Lotus SmartSuite and the year 2000](https://i.snap.as/qBzkbjEA.png)_I stumbled across this wonderfulhelp document in [Lotus SmartSuite 9.8](https://winworldpc.com/product/lotus-smartsuite/9-8) and my headjust shot right off._ 
All of the programs in this release of Lotus SmartSuite meet Lotus guidelines for Year 2000 (Y2K) readiness.When used in accordance with its associated documentation, each of the SmartSuite programs is capable ofcorrectly processing, providing and/or receiving date data within and between the 20th and 21st centuries,provided that all products (for example, hardware, software and firmware) used with the program properlyexchange accurate date data with it. 
**A little background information**In the past, you have probably entered a 2-digit number to represent the year in a date with the assumptionthat the year would fall between 1900 and 1999. For example, 4/10/02 was in 1902 and 5/8/47 was in 1947. 
With the change to the year 2000, you should be aware that computer programs may now interpret datesyou enter with 2-digit years to be in the 20th or the 21st century depending on the method the programuses to define a 2-digit year. 
SmartSuite programs use a sliding (rolling) window method to determine the year when you enter only 2digits to represent the year in a date. 
**Notes** 
-You can enter the year as 4 digits to make sure you get the results you want. For example, enter 1916 or2016 instead of 16 for the year.
-Although you can change how a program displays a date by selecting different date formats, the programstores a constant value for the date no matter how you choose to display it. 
**What is the sliding window method?**In SmartSuite, the sliding window method defines a window of 100 years around the current year(determined by the system date on your computer). When you enter a 2-digit year, the program comparesthe 2 digits you entered with the years that fall within this 100 year window.For example, entering 25 for the year might be interpreted as 1925 but 04 might mean the year 2004. 
The years that mark the beginning and end of this window are defined by where the program splits thewindow with the current year.By default, 1-2-3, Approach, Freelance Graphics, Organizer, and Word Pro use an 80/20 rule for this slidingwindow -- the window begins 80 years before and ends 19 years after the current year. 
**How does the 80/20 rule work?**Suppose the current year is 1999. Using the 80/20 rule, a window spanning 100 years includes the years1919 to 2018. 
In 1999, any 2-digit year you enter from 19 to 99 will equal years from 1919 to 1999. Any 2-digit year youenter from 00 to 18 will equal years from 2000 to 2018. If you want to enter a date before 1919 or after2018, you must enter 4 digits for the year.For example, assume that the current year is 1999.
•
 If you enter 4/2/19, the year will be 1919.

•
 If you enter 4/2/72, the year will be 1972.

•
 If you enter 4/2/00, the year will be 2000.

•
 If you enter 4/2/17, the year will be 2017.

•
 If you enter 4/2/1917, the year will be 1917.Every year this 100 year window moves (slides) forward one year. Under the 80/20 rule, when the yearchanges to 2000, the window will include the years 1920 to 2019. When the year changes to 2001, the 


window will include the years 1921 to 2020, and so on. 
**How do you change the 80/20 default?**The 80/20 default for SmartSuite is set through a single entry in the Windows registry. You can change thisregistry entry using the sample scripts available on the Web (www.lotus.com/smartsuitedev) and in the\\Extra directory on the CD version of Lotus SmartSuite.**Caution** Changing the default changes it for all of the programs in SmartSuite. 
**How do SmartSuite programs store dates?**All the SmartSuite programs store date values with the fully qualified year. Therefore, dates already stored infiles are not affected by the sliding window. The sliding window is used to interpret a date when you enter itusing 2 digits to represent the year.**Caution** If years are stored as separate values in a file, and scripts or macros interpret these dates asthey run, the sliding window rules will apply to those values when only 2 digits are stored for the year. 
**For 1-2-3 users only**You can turn off the 80/20 sliding window in 1-2-3 by changing the date settings in the 1-2-3 Preferencesdialog box. You can also display all dates with 4-digit years. For more information on 1-2-3 and the year2000, open Help in 1-2-3 and search on Year 2000 in the Help Index.

[*Extratone*'s theme](https://write.as/themes/extratone) was listed on [write.as' new themes project](https://write.as/themes) awhile ago, of which I am quite proud. I've begun [crossposting](https://crossposter.masto.donte.com.br/) to[Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@DavidBlue) from [Twitter](https://twitter.com/NeoYokel) again.

## Autos And Such 
I'm mostly blogging because I am fairly stuck on the [Volkwagen Atlas review](https://bit.ly/2XJvcsQ) Ipromised to get done this week. (That link is to an online Word doc of my live progress, on which I'd loveany comments on if you have them.) I've been playing enough [Gran Turismo Sport](https://dieselgoth.com/tag:GTsport) that I've created a new blog specifically for automotive writing at[**dieselgoth.com**](https://dieselgoth.com). There, on Titanic day, I made [a post](https://dieselgoth.com/review-progress-updates-and-social-links) including an ["exclusive" invite link tomastd.racing](https://mastd.racing/invite/vc8GBJqX), which I would compel any enthusiasts among you tooblige.

[This feature](https://daily.bandcamp.com/features/uk-bleep-and-bass-feature) on the *Bandcamp Daily*regarding "Bleep" has really been my shit. Imagine my 70-year-old mother dancing to [this](https://ceasedesist1.bandcamp.com/track/nightmares-on-wax-21st-kong). 
> [Matt] Anniss subsequently went on a local Bristol internet station, penned a blog post, and posted [a DJset of Bleep](https://www.mixcloud.com/sellbydave/bass-ment-jacks-bleep-history-mix-for-hivemindfm/), asa way to convince those same DJs that his thesis had some merit. He wrote an in-depth feature on the formfor electronic music site [Resident Advisor](https://www.residentadvisor.net/features/2349)—which causedhim to think bigger about this formative, unsung moment in UK dance music history. “I found the sounditself alien and otherworldly, but also endlessly fascinating for some reason,” he says. “It seemed so freshand futuristic still, but also mysterious.” 
## Software and Stuff 
Still waiting on my tax return/possible Corona stipend, I have lost my subscription to Google One, meaningthe business Extratone Gmail (ihadtopee@gmail.com) is about to be unhooked(?)/deleted/no longer able to 
receive mail. As such, I've spent the past few days moving accounts to davidblue@extratone.com includingthe newsletters I'm most fond of (like [Nextdraft](https://nextdraft.com/).) This has given me a goodopportunity to weed out those I don't particularly care about *and* to try using Outlook as my primary emailclient once again. Somehow, this has got me reverted into trying to make use of my Microsoft Officebusiness subscription once again - I have (eeek!) *not* been writing in Markdown. May the Gourd havemercy on my text format-fucking soul. 
![Two Microsoft Apps on My Homescreen](https://i.snap.as/tpDJ4xL.png) 
The *other* project I've been trying to distract myself from the Atlas review with is my list ofpoweruser/especially handy Windows/iOS/MacOS applications/tricks that I believe just about *everyone*should be using. From "[Dirty Dave's Poweruser Tips](https://eileenlong­my.sharepoint.com/:w:/g/personal/david_eileenlonglcsw_com/EUuSyGOkq-pBiluCgHpOovwBOQIYkIMB6rsk_R7f3_olcA?e=tWYyQq)" (working title): 
> I want you to come away from this list feeling as liberated and powerful as I do now when I’m On MyComputer without any condescension or tedium. Unfortunately, there’s probably going to be some of both,so please stick with me and don’t take it personally. I do *a lot* of online reading, writing, and fiddling. I’vebeen compelled to do these things in one form or another since very early childhood, and what follows couldbe described as a list of my favorite tools to accomplish things. Almost all of them are entirely free to useand the vast majority of them are easily and beautifully functional as well. They are what I suggest for myown mother to use, for what that’s worth, and I would argue sincerely for their extreme importance. **Don’twaste your life on bad software.** 
## Fucking Medium 
In late March *Nieman Lab*'s [Laura Hazard Owen](https://twitter.com/laurahazardowen) published "[Thelong, complicated, and extremely frustrating history of Medium, 2012–present](https://www.niemanlab.org/2019/03/the-long-complicated-and-extremely-frustrating-history-of-medium­2012-present/#footnote_0_169692)," which includes the most complete, linear timeline of the website'sexistence anyone could ever ask for. Naturally - in classic medium fashion - she begins many of hersentences with "But," which [I really hate](https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/1250153204014288902). 
> Why spend so much time worrying about what Medium is? Maybe because we wanted to know whether itwas a friend or an enemy. The answer is that it’s neither. It’s a reflection of what the media industry hasworried about, and hoped for, and not received. But Medium was never something that we would get todefine. Instead, it’s turned out to be an endless thought experiment into what publishing on the internetcould look like. That’s not much fun for people who got burned along the way, but Medium was neverexactly ours to begin with.

# Z..a. .lg. o. .G.. e. n. .e..r¸. a.. t.o.r. for iOS ![Zalgo Generator for iOS](https://i.snap.as/2ixUKqT.png) ## A powerful iOS utility for fucking digital text with ruthless efficiency. 
A warning siren sounds louder still for the current state of the *Digital Divide* than the profoundly ignorantspectacle of Mark Zuckerberg’s drooling, ghoulish interrogators last year from the digital hole of none otherthan [W3School’s trusty web validator](https://validator.w3.org), which would surely be rated as the MostAnxious Being in History if it were to acquire sentience. The CSS file this very webpage referenced returnedno fewer than *[350 syntax errors](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator?uri=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.extratone.com&profile=css3svg&usermedium=all&warning=1&vextwarning=&lang=en)* at the time of this writing; **[Facebook dot com’s login page](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css­validator/validator?uri=http%3A%2F%2Ffacebook.com&profile=css3svg&usermedium=all&warning=1&vextwarning=&lang=en)** set off only 55. For going on a *decade*, now, the web has continued to expand into a grotesque,diseased mass. 
Yet another piece of software I have notably been using for 10 years: the infamous [eemo.net](http://www.eeemo.net/) Zalgo web text fucker. Ideally, I’d now proceed to embed some special examplesof the hedonistic online text vandalism which the tool enabled me to inflict widely throughout myadolescence. However - as you can probably imagine - *searching* for these criminally-broken posts usingstandard tools provided by the services that have hosted them is virtually futile. In retrospect, I do not recallever eliciting any acknowledgment of Zalgo’s effects, yet I’m positive that at least the *majority* of myvictims set eyes upon the mess at some point - their silence is actually more entertaining than not, I think.Despite my extensive use of the format, I made a point to maintain my total ignorance about the origin of“[Zalgo](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/zalgo)” for the past decade - only spoiling it **in the name ofgood journalism** for your sake and this review. 
> On forums and image boards, scrambled text began being associated with Zalgo with phrases like "hecomes" and "he waits behind the wall." David Higgins revealed that the text is an ~abuse~ of a Unicodefeature that enables the user to combine multiple superscript and subscript characters into a vertical line. 
By bizarre coincidence or some ridiculously obscure, intractable common cultural thread (which wouldprobably take a lifetime to successfully trace,) [Dave Higgins](https://octodon.social/@DaveHiggins) and Iwere *already mutuals* on Mastodon before I had any idea his name was at all associated with Zalgo. Morebizarre still: Dave must’ve been watching his timeline at the exact moment when I [posted the above quote](https://mastodon.social/@DavidBlue/102564857843257870) mentioning him.

Unfortunately, it seems his blog has moved, killing the hyperlink citation in one of the two relevant searchengine results for “zalgo”: [its *Know Your Meme* page](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/zalgo).[Searching the same term](https://davidjhiggins.wordpress.com/?s=zalgo) on his new WordPress blog yields*absolutely nothing*, so perhaps “I deny everything” was a more sincere response than one expected. Athread on *Stack Overflow* entitled [“How does Zalgo text work?”](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6579844/how-does-zalgo-text-work) explains the fuckery in moredetail than I ever could: 
> You can easily construct a character sequence, consisting of a base character and “combining above”marks, of any length, to reach any desired visual height, assuming that the rendering software conforms tothe Unicode rendering model. 
There is something artistic about destroyed text like this - something that's more than just edgy chaos. I believe in "[surreal memes](https://mashable.com/article/surreal-memes/)" that can break Facebook andTwitter posts. I believe in Zalgo, and I believe you need [Zalgo Generator for iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/zalgo-generator/id1178473555) on your phone *right now*.
