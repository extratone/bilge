# Craig Toomey's Coronavirus

![The Langoliers](https://i.snap.as/DGO3fQ4.jfif)

## In Stephen King's "The Langoliers," the state of today's air travel is foreshadowed.

I told myself I would not be topical - that I would publicly ignore the coronavirus - but I can no longer. There is simply too much to say about one of the most emotionally effective, surreal films of my childhood. *The Langoliers* occupied 9-11PM's slot on ABC for May 14th and 15th, 1995 (Sunday and Monday, twenty-five years ago.) It's an adaptation of a [Stephen King novel](https://www.amazon.com/Langoliers-Stephen-King/dp/1982136057) of the same title and is fairly widely-regarded as [the worst such adaptation](https://letterboxd.com/yojrb/film/the-langoliers/) of all time. You can now watch the whole three hours of *The Langoliers* in 480p (supposedly) at your leisure [thanks to YouTube](https://youtu.be/TiTMGWi_mlc). One commenter echoes what I'm about to tell you: "My god! I thought I dreamed this movie up as a kid. I have been trying to describe this to people for years and here it is, it’s real!" In order to write this, I joined the [Stephen King Wiki Discord server](https://discord.gg/X3bAngj) and was immediately welcomed with a request not to type in the text channels: "I’m working on adding some new channels so pls nobody type in them til I’m done."

<iframe width="auto" height="auto" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TiTMGWi_mlc?controls=0" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

*The Langoliers* begins with a pissed-off British secret agent (Mark Lindsay Chapman,) an insane businessman (Bronson Pinchot,) a psychic, vision-impaired young woman (Kate Maberly,) Sarah Jessica Parker (Patricia Wettig,) and a *just*-widowed pilot (David Morse) all boarding the same redeye flight to Boston - American Pride Flight 29. This group falls asleep and mysteriously wakes up alone on the aircraft except for Stephen King himself (Dean Stockwell,) a stupid incel violinist (Christopher Collet,) and a stoner (Kimber Riddle.) My favorite character, Craig Toomey, is the "twerp" business boy with daddy issues who can't stop himself from demanding to know what's going on. James Bond shuts him up with a "nose hold."

> Whoa. No one's driving the plane!

David Morse proceeds to try and contact air traffic control in a fairly-realistic manner, but is unable to receieve any radio signals at all, even from Strategic Air Command. Frankie Faison plays the single person of color on the flight, Don Gaffney - "a tool and die worker for Hughes Aircraft" - who dies first, of course. James Bond lecures David about inciting panic and almost immediately reveals his secret identity. Then, the Hungry Idiot (Baxter Harris) wakes up whilst Toomey begins screaming again.

> Scaring the little girl? Scaring the little girl?! Lady, we're diverting to some tin-pot airport in the middle of nowhere, and I've got better things to think about than scaring the little girl!

After the entirety of the male cast threatens to beat him up, Toomey, sweating his balls off, begins slowly tearing strips of paper and moaning sexually like an absolute madman. Some irritiatingly irrelevant dialogue insues in which Stephen King Author Man narrates through Sherlock Holmes deduction to figure absolutely nothing out. He is wearing stripes on plaid. He suggests that the entire situation could be some sort of government experiment and I can't believe I'm wasting your time with this. "If it were just this plane, I could give you a scenario, but unfortunately, it's not just this plane. The city of Denver is probably still down there, but all its lights were off if it was." Here you can see how excellently [this script](https://eileenlong-my.sharepoint.com/:b:/g/personal/david_eileenlonglcsw_com/EUcVc3WXy4FLkBEtbl6ZOkgBXJSgV9zkQlACXEaq3U3DJQ) was written.

> I've been sitting here running all these old stories through my head. You know, time warps, space warps, alien raiding parties. I mean, we really don't know if there's anything left down there, do we?

Sarah Jessica Parker reveals to Powers Girl that she's on her way to meet a guy she's been emailing with. Stoner girl asks if everything is going to be okay and Incel Violinist looks horny. She's going to rehab for stones. The captain announces to his nine passengers that they're beginning their descent into Bangor International Airport, near Stephen King's birthplace. Don asks Toomey to stop ripping up paper and the useless food addict yells "well, at least we'll be able to get some chow when we land" offscreen. Craig, sweating even more, is still ripping up magazines in the face of Don's threats. "Try it, you little jackass," he says. I'm wondering where I can snag this American Pride livery for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020. Director Tom Holland manages to add drama to a more-or-less routine landing.

> This place is utterly, totally deserted... You know, there's something wrong with the air here, Brian.

It's occuring to me that this may be the worst script I've ever actually sat through reading. "This place smells wrong. Really badly wrong." Toomey threatens to sue the airline for $30 million for missing his 9AM meeting before seeing flashbacks to his abusive father (John Griesemer,) who mentions the Langoliers for the first time. The deserted airport scene is the reason I've written this whole thing - the dulled sounds of the characters' heels on the tarmac, the putrefied air. The clocks have stopped. The payphones are dead. The computers are lifeless. The *abadonedness* of it all. This is what the coronavirus has done to the world and to Craig Toomey. Even the battery-powered devices are dead. This is what confuses Stephen King Author Man to the point of head-rubbing and cigarette smoking for the first time in ten years.

The production was actually made at Bangor International Airport as [this incredible video](https://youtu.be/D6McXLFsx-M) hosted by Toomey's actor explores.

> LOVE IS NOT PART OF THE BIG PICTURE!

It's never actually explained what The Langoliers are. Ken Tucker for *Entertainment Weekly* describes them as "[little meatballs](https://ew.com/article/1995/05/12/tv-movie-review-langoliers/)." The little Beatles-haired girl can hear them approaching. "It sounds a little like rice krispies after you pour the milk." Foodism abounds. "A really terrible, scary sound... Something making that horrible cereal noise." She screams that the cereal is going to kill them. Somehow, Toomey finds a revolver while he's losing his mind. Kimber Riddle the Stoner [went to NYU](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0725760/). 

> Don't forget, Craiggy-weggy, the langoliers were here. And they will be back.

Stephen King Author Man and Food Addict note that the food and soda have gone completely flat. "Tastes like old tire," says Don. "What we're dealing with is time, not dimension," says Stephen King. I'm wondering what in the hell sort of room they're in at the moment, and who decided those light wood countertops were *ever* a good idea.

> The bottom line is, I believe, that we have hopped an absurdly short distance into the past, say as little as 15 minutes, and we're discovering the unlovely truth about time travel. That one can't appear in the Texas State School Book Depository on November 22nd, 1963 and hope to stop the Kennedy assassination. One can't witness the building of the pyramids or the sack of Rome, or investigate the age of the dinosaurs firsthand. No, fellow time travellers, have a look around you. This is the past. It's empty. It's silent. It's a world with all the meaning of a discarded old paint can. Sensory input has disappeared. Electricity has already disappeared. And time itself is winding down in a kind of a spiral that's going faster and faster.

Little Prophet notes that the sound she's been hearing is once again getting louder. Mr. Toomey's face is shoved in the floor, his nose bent.

# Discord is Better Than Slack

![Discord Art Orange](https://i.snap.as/szp1oaF.png)

## Why Extratone has used Discord instead of Slack for our team chat.

Back in 2015, I hosted a pre-*Extratone* culture podcast called [*Drycast*](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2zjkrB28csR68YoY1M1eSk) with musician friends from all over the net. To record remotely, we originally used Teamspeak 3 - a gamer VoIP staple. When I discovered Discord, I thought we'd found podcasting heaven. Originally, the free plan included 128kbps audio in its voice channels, which was nearly twice what we were getting out of our *paid* Teamspeak server. If I were still podcasting, Discord's [just-released server video feature](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360041721052-Server-Video) would undoubtedly prove invaluable for live streams.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">are you thankful for Discord?</p>&mdash; David Blue (@NeoYokel) <a href="https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/1261334179352100865?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 15, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

According to [a poll I ran on Twitter](https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/1261334179352100865?s=20), 2/3rds of all people on Earth are thankful for Discord's existence. This is not surprising considering what every Discord user is still offered without spending any money at all: community spaces with audio/video and text chat capability, organizable by Twitch and YouTube-integrated roles with a plethora of different permission options, instantly and easily shareable by customizable temporary or permanent invite links through an application that's about as cross-platform as one can get (Windows, Mac, Linux, Android, iOS, or simply one's web browser.) Those of us that remember [IRC](https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/1244758973867229185), Ventrilo, and Teamspeak should all consider Discord a tremendous gift.

<iframe width="auto" height="auto" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NNJ2n6XKmmA?controls=0" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Never before have so many VoIP, video, and text chat features been offered together, or in such a beautiful package. "What we really did was create an all-in-one voice, video, and text chat app that replaced this constellation of tools that people would use," said CEO Jason Citron in [an interview with CNBC](https://youtu.be/NNJ2n6XKmmA). Technically in terms of these details, Discord *has no competition*. Slack offers text and voice chat with its paid plans, yes, but nothing close in terms of video - especially considering [Discord Go Live](https://www.polygon.com/2019/8/9/20798559/discord-go-live-private-stream-voice-channel), its fairly-new streaming feature, which allows users to stream game video directly to 10 other users in the server. With some jury-rigging, it's possible to simply screen share this way, which is an essential sell for business video communication applications like Skype.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Does anyone else have a discord server where you&#39;re the only member and you use different text channels to plan your weekly schedules lmaoooo</p>&mdash; Jab 🏳️‍🌈 #BLM (@jab50yen) <a href="https://twitter.com/jab50yen/status/1270886743395520512?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 11, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

"Discord and Slack have many similarities, but Discord is the superior tool," says [esports team Ardent United](https://medium.com/ardentunited/why-we-use-discord-and-not-slack-500ac8027824). "Discord has voice channels, which allows us to easily chat with our supporters and other team members. Discord also allows us to set user roles and permissions which makes moderation extremely simple." It's not just gaming companies, though. Decentralized cloud platform Sia also [moved their community](https://blog.sia.tech/sia-is-moving-from-slack-to-discord-195f87feb6a6) to Discord:

> Its intended audience is gamers, but many large communities have switched from Slack to Discord, including development communities like [Reactiflux](https://facebook.github.io/react/blog/2015/10/19/reactiflux-is-moving-to-discord.html) and [Unreal Slackers](https://medium.com/@polymoon/unreal-slackers-is-moving-to-discord-c93492eb0612). It includes an unlimited number of users, unlimited file uploads (with a per-file size limit), unlimited message histories, and really great moderation and spam filtering features.

Slack is [often praised](https://www.pcmag.com/reviews/slack) for its integrations, but it shares support with [Zapier](https://zapier.com/blog/slack-vs-discord/) - a dedicated web integration service which more or less integrates them equally.

> Slack works with [a long list of tools](https://slack.com/integrations), including Google Calendar, Zendesk, Salesforce, Wunderlist, and dozens of others. If you're looking for an integration that isn't immediately obvious, you can always turn to Zapier for help, because Slack is a supported service. Zapier is an online service that creates integrations between other apps and services, without you having to know any code to make it happen.

For sharing detailed post embeds, there's also [Discohook](https://discohook.org/), which I just discovered. Productivity company Chanty's blog wrote perhaps [the most in-depth comparison](https://www.chanty.com/blog/discord-vs-slack) of the two services (emphasis theirs):

> At their core, Discord and Slack and very similar. Both are **team chat apps** with a similar interface. Both apps have **team communication organized** in channels. The biggest difference between the two is their **target audience**, and of course, their **specific features**.

Ultimately, one must decide how relevant the services' respective target audiences are to productivity. For a not-for-profit media organization like *Extratone*, Discord's features-for-price ratio is simply too rich to pass up. If you'd like, [stop by our server](https://discord.gg/0b9KQUKP858b0iZF) or try out [our server template](https://discord.new/Nx7gawD84mMx).

# Microsoft Build 2020 in Dogs

![Microsoft Build Olive Tracker](https://i.snap.as/oDUqtqe.png)

## New Microsoft Office features, the PowerToys Run Preview, and a test of Edge Chromium.

I have no idea why I signed up to attend Microsoft's virtual 2020 Build Conference, but I did. I thought I'd add my [End User](https://anchor.fm/davidblue) commentary to the mix. Sorry. My first event was called "Every developer is welcome, with Scott Hanselman and guests." Hanselman is listed as a [blogger](https://www.hanselman.com/) and [podcaster](http://hanselminutes.com) living (of course) in Portland. I'm not a "real" developer, but I know what Microsoft Teams is, and I recognized the event as a desktop screenshare of his calls with different Microsoft employees. There was a [child invasion](https://twitter.com/JuanKRuiz/status/1262789374128816128) and a dropped phone. I also noticed the icon for the ["new" Microsoft Edge](https://www.zdnet.com/article/meet-the-new-microsoft-edge-your-move-google/) browser in his taskbar and realized that I hadn't downloaded it yet. I remedied that for the conference's sake - I thought it only appropriate that I try to use as much Microsoft software as possible in this context. I also installed the new [PowerTools Run preview](https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/19/21262060/microsoft-windows-10-launcher-powertoy-spotlight-alfred-download-build) which I mentioned in my [tips post](https://bilge.world/poweruser-tips-software-shortcuts).

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Epic <a href="https://twitter.com/shanselman?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@shanselman</a> moment! awesome, glad to share our new realities.

Build allows an attendee to build one's own event schedule, but I neglected to find those focused on what I really care about: **Office 365**. As [reported by *The Verge*](https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/19/21260005/microsoft-office-fluid-web-document-features-build), [Microsoft Fluid](https://eileenlong-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/g/personal/david_eileenlonglcsw_com/EXd7qVaXqRlHlnnllT7_A5gBRw-ypXkANGTIWlzEPlLzQA?e=PrLfh6) is going to change a lot:

> Microsoft’s Fluid Framework sounds a lot like Google Docs, but it’s actually Google Docs on steroids. Microsoft is so confident it has built the future of productivity, it’s now open-sourcing its Fluid Framework so the rest of the world can help shape what it has created.

There's also [Microsoft Lists](https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-lists-150002899.html), which is reportedly going to revolutionize SharePoint Lists into something more modern and useful:

> It builds off the [existing feature in SharePoint](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/what-is-a-list-in-sharepoint-93262a88-20ad-4edc-8410-b6909b2f59a5), and will let you track progress and data to organize your teams, potentially making the company’s offerings more streamlined and productive.

![Microsoft PowerToys Run](https://i.snap.as/XmboQGr.png)

## Microsoft Edge Chromium

As an Office 365 administrator, I basically only use Edge for administrative/management tasks. Otherwise, I can't imagine a reason to use it over Firefox, Brave, Vivaldi, Chrome, Opera, etc, but I thought I'd give the "new" (as of January) Edge a tryout for your sake and make it my default browser for a day as well as Microsoft's Bing search engine. There's also news specific to Build: [Edge is integrating with Pinterest](https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/19/microsoft-edge-gets-a-pinterest-integration-sidebar-search-and-automatic-profile-switching/), of all things:

> Now, Edge will feature a Pinterest-powered tool that will show suggestions from Pinterest at the bottom of a collection. Clicking on that, Microsoft says, will take users to a Pinterest board “of similar, trending Pins so users can quickly find and add ideas relevant to their collection.” Users will also be able to export collections to Pinterest.

I'm in no position to "test" a browser, but the new Edge is noticeably faster at rendering pages and much *much* smoother when navigating between tabs/preference windows. It looks much more like Chrome, which makes sense. Perhaps because my install is absent of third-party extensions, opening new tabs and windows was much faster than my other browsers. I recorded a [~2 minute demo](https://vimeo.com/420430704) of normal browsing on [my Surface Laptop 2](https://extratone.com/microsoft-surface-laptop-2-review-windows-future).

<iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/420430704" width="auto" height="auto" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowfullscreen></iframe>

In terms of touch support, Edge remains the only acceptable browser on Windows 10. If you've spent money on a new PC recently, chances are your device is touch-enabled. If you're like me, you've already [disabled it](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4028019/windows-enable-and-disable-your-touchscreen-in-windows-10). If not, you'll find scrolling and navigation in Edge have improved tremendously - it's like an entirely new browser [because it is](https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/6/18527550/microsoft-chromium-edge-google-history-collaboration).

> Because Edge used a different rendering engine than Chrome or Safari, it meant that it would sometimes have problems on websites. Testing a website against multiple browsers has always been difficult, and because Edge had so little uptake, it meant optimizing for it often fell off the priority list for web developers.

I really like how easy it is to mute audio from tabs and how much better [my CMS](https://write.as) is rendered. I still prefer Firefox's method of tab switching (by last-used chronologically instead of in the order presented.) The reader view is smoother than its competitors and offers a beautiful selection of themes as well as the best "Read aloud" feature in the business.

![Microsoft Edge Reader View](https://i.snap.as/jWqG85f.png)

I'm not going to quote you measurements - check out [*Computerworld*'s browser review](https://www.computerworld.com/article/3513973/microsofts-new-edge-browser-third-times-the-charm.html) for that - but I can say that Edge Chromium is using more RAM than Firefox but a bit less than Chrome. [Office.com](http://office.com) also looks and works incredibly well. Overall, I'm extremely impressed with Edge Chromium and the improvements to Bing. As of my experiences today, it's the fastest and smoothest web browser I have, which is a complete flip from that of the old Edge.

# Z̴͏a͞l͟g͝o͏ ̕G͟͝e͞n͞҉è̛ŗ͡a͝͞t̴o҉r͞ for iOS

![Zalgo Generator for iOS](https://i.snap.as/2ixUKqT.png)

## A powerful iOS utility for fucking digital text with ruthless efficiency.

A warning siren sounds louder still for the current state of the *Digital Divide* than the profoundly ignorant spectacle of Mark Zuckerberg’s drooling, ghoulish interrogators last year from the digital hole of none other than [W3School’s trusty web validator](https://validator.w3.org), which would surely be rated as the Most Anxious Being in History if it were to acquire sentience. The CSS file this very webpage referenced returned no fewer than *[350 syntax errors](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator?uri=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.extratone.com&profile=css3svg&usermedium=all&warning=1&vextwarning=&lang=en)* at the time of this writing; **[Facebook dot com’s login page](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator?uri=http%3A%2F%2Ffacebook.com&profile=css3svg&usermedium=all&warning=1&vextwarning=&lang=en)** set off only 55. For going on a *decade*, now, the web has continued to expand into a grotesque, diseased mass.

Yet another piece of software I have notably been using for 10 years: the infamous [eemo.net](http://www.eeemo.net/) Zalgo web text fucker. Ideally, I’d now proceed to embed some special examples of the hedonistic online text vandalism which the tool enabled me to inflict widely throughout my adolescence. However - as you can probably imagine - *searching* for these criminally-broken posts using standard tools provided by the services that have hosted them is virtually futile. In retrospect, I do not recall ever eliciting any acknowledgment of Zalgo’s effects, yet I’m positive that at least the *majority* of my victims set eyes upon the mess at some point - their silence is actually more entertaining than not, I think. Despite my extensive use of the format, I made a point to maintain my total ignorance about the origin of “[Zalgo](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/zalgo)” for the past decade - only spoiling it **in the name of good journalism** for your sake and this review.

> On forums and image boards, scrambled text began being associated with Zalgo with phrases like "he comes" and "he waits behind the wall." David Higgins revealed that the text is an ~abuse~ of a Unicode feature that enables the user to combine multiple superscript and subscript characters into a vertical line. 

By bizarre coincidence or some ridiculously obscure, intractable common cultural thread (which would probably take a lifetime to successfully trace,) [Dave Higgins](https://octodon.social/@DaveHiggins) and I were *already mutuals* on Mastodon before I had any idea his name was at all associated with Zalgo. More bizarre still: Dave must’ve been watching his timeline at the exact moment when I [posted the above quote](https://mastodon.social/@DavidBlue/102564857843257870) mentioning him.

Unfortunately, it seems his blog has moved, killing the hyperlink citation in one of the two relevant search engine results for “zalgo”: [its *Know Your Meme* page](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/zalgo). [Searching the same term](https://davidjhiggins.wordpress.com/?s=zalgo) on his new WordPress blog yields *absolutely nothing*, so perhaps “I deny everything” was a more sincere response than one expected. A thread on *Stack Overflow* entitled [“How does Zalgo text work?”](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6579844/how-does-zalgo-text-work) explains the fuckery in more detail than I ever could:

> You can easily construct a character sequence, consisting of a base character and “combining above” marks, of any length, to reach any desired visual height, assuming that the rendering software conforms to the Unicode rendering model. 

There is something artistic about destroyed text like this - something that's more than just edgy chaos. I believe in "[surreal memes](https://mashable.com/article/surreal-memes/)" that can break Facebook and Twitter posts. I believe in Zalgo, and I believe you need [Zalgo Generator for iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/zalgo-generator/id1178473555) on your phone *right now*.

# Star Trek: Fuck

![Star Trek Discovery](https://i.snap.as/pshqmlW.jpg)

## Discovery is pushing boundaries, but for what purpose?

*Discovery* may no longer be new - not even the newest *Star Trek* property - but it *is* new to me. According to the [alternate timeline exemption](https://web.archive.org/web/20091227080806/http:/www.mtv.com/movies/news/articles/1611063/20090511/story.jhtml) of the J.J. movies, I've been left without "Canon" *Star Trek* television since 2005 (or 2155) with the last episode of *Enterprise*, but I've been looking forward with moderate anticipation to an opportunity to watch this new entry into "[the stodgiest and squarest of all sci-fi universes](https://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/in-star-trek-discovery-the-future-is-a-simpler-time)." Though I am extremely well-versed in Gene Roddenberry's baby, I come to both you and *Discovery* with absolutely zero desire to analyze whether or not it is "Trek" enough, "good" science-fiction, or even "good" television - I'd like only to land on your screen between all of these institutions and their proctors in some unique insight from all of them, without the clichés, cringey jokes, or unnecessary *Trek*ism. What I will strive to do is perform [my Special Duty](https://extratone.com/solo-star-wars-film-review) in relation to American intellectual property mastodons for which I have my own adoration: to determine whether or not [they should die](https://extratone.com/star-wars-the-force-awakens-review). I know absolutely *nothing* about television writing – the same amount I know [about film](https://extratone.com/tag:film) – so I hope I can provide something usefully unique.

I would rather *Star Trek* **not** have to die, but I wouldn’t be surprised if it’s necessary. Without sounding like I have to prove myself, know that the property – in particular the history of *Star Trek Online*’s development – was a very important part of my adolescent life. I have watched every episode of every series several times at least, but I know better than to entrust my entire emotional existence into the promise of a continuation like *Discovery*. It most fascinates me how revivals of old names like this go about contextualizing their dialogue and other elements for today’s audience. “[Snug as a bug in a rug](https://subslikescript.com/series/Star_Trek_Discovery-5171438/season-1/episode-3-Context_is_for_Kings)” is surely not an expression we should expect to survive the next 250 years of human development, and yet this is supposed to be an aspirational series? It even made it in the recap! I should confess now: it is actually *Star Trek Online* which made me curious enough to seek out a CBS All Access Free Trial. The marketing worked very well.

![The Measure of Morality](https://i.snap.as/4Wgb1i1.png)

I tend to install the game for a few weeks or so around this time every year just to check in. This time, I was greeted by [*Star Trek Online: Legacy*](https://www.pcgamer.com/star-trek-onlines-legacy-update-lets-you-live-your-star-trek-picard-dreams/) – a new expansion featuring *Voyager*’s Jeri Ryan and *Discovery*’s Sonequa Martin-Green reprising their respective characters in voiceover roles. I figured out that Michael Burnham must have been from The New Show fairly quickly, but I was disappointed to find out that the character was not in fact a trans man, but rather a female character with an unusually male name. For the most part, Burnham is simply an outlier in *The Measure of Morality* Parts [I](https://sto.gamepedia.com/Mission:_The_Measure_of_Morality_(Part_1)) and [II](https://sto.gamepedia.com/Mission:_The_Measure_of_Morality_(Part_2)). She accompanies one’s character (along with Seven of Nine) to several different battlegrounds and stories we’d already seen before in previous episodes – *when the budget’s running low, reuse sets*, but there is one instance where *we* are brought into *her* (*Discovery*’s) world, which feels disorienting. The whole experience plays like it was forced upon STO by CBS in order to squeeze as many viewers into our free CBS All Access trials with as little developmental investment into the game as possible. Well, here I am!

In Season 1, Episode 4 of *Discovery*, the writers made a [very foul mistake](https://www.geekwire.com/2017/star-trek-discovery-elon-musk/)… They placed fucking Elon Musk’s name alongside the aviation pioneering Wright Brothers and the fictional inventor of warp drive, Zefram Cochrane.

> How do you want to be remembered in history? Alongside the Wright Brothers, Elon Musk, Zefram Cochrane? Or as a failed fungus expert?

I can’t be timid about this – it straight up makes me *ill*. I can *guarantee* you that Orville and Wilbur Wright would have *never* watched fucking *South Park* and that I am actually going to be sick right here on this couch.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I&#39;m sorry, I don&#39;t look up to anyone who watches South Park. it&#39;s just a personal rule, okay?</p>&mdash; David Blue (@NeoYokel) <a href="https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/1255564278247063555?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 29, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

I’ll spare you further ranting, but… Jesus Christ. I will not believe that I live in a world where this sort of comparison is acceptable. I’m not going to freak out because they say “shit” and “fuck” now, though I do wonder what Gene Roddenberry (though he [wasn’t all that great](https://www.nationalreview.com/2016/09/star-trek-gene-roddenberry-was-misogynistic-hack/), it turns out) would say – something like “[profanity is no longer a necessary part of 23rd century language](https://youtu.be/x6-UAditg7Y).” I thought [Morgan Jeffery’s take](https://www.digitalspy.com/tv/ustv/a840967/star-trek-discovery-episode-5-fuck-swearing/) on this for *Digital Spy* was an interesting one:

> There's an argument to be made that the old style of Trek might feel naive in 2017. But there's another that it'd be a refreshing antidote to the times, the Trek we really need right now as opposed to the one we deserve.

I like to watch fellow *Star Trek* enthusiasts squirm and cry “continuity” and “[canon](https://slate.com/culture/2017/09/how-shows-like-star-trek-discovery-stick-to-canon.html)” as much as any reasonable human being, but I’m not sure this sort of boundary-pushing is actually productive. Is anything being accomplished? Other than marking *Discovery* forever as *not* “[family-friendly entertainment](https://www.quora.com/What-would-Gene-Roddenberry-have-thought-of-the-use-of-the-F-word-in-Star-Trek-Discovery)?” Linguistically, the word “fucking” in “fucking cool” was used for emphasis, which perhaps suggests there was no other way for the character to express that level of enthusiasm. In his [*IndieWire* interview](https://www.indiewire.com/2017/10/star-trek-discovery-anthony-rapp-interview-fuck-1201887710/), Anthony Rapp (Paul Stamets) explains: 

> “These people just put their brains to work in a really tough way and they had a breakthrough. And I imagine there’s scientists in their labs who might do that any time. We didn’t drop the F-bomb in ‘Star Trek’ by telling something to go fuck themselves. It’s like we did it by saying ‘this is fucking cool.'”

![Stamets in the Spore Drive](https://i.snap.as/9epUHlp.png)

If *Discovery* was “making history,” I’m not so sure what [*Star Trek: Picard*](https://bilge.world/star-trek-picard-review) was doing with *fucking* and *pissant*. I’m also not sure it matters at all in the grander scheme. What other freedoms should CBS feel free to explore, now that they’ve said the bad words? What else hasn’t been explored? Bathrooms? Shitting and farting? That has my vote. I really don’t remember as many colloquialisms showing up in the earlier series, but perhaps that’s just because those colloquialisms have since become part of our language. I’m not the greatest television watcher of all time, but I got lost in *Discovery*’s plot, and apparently I’m [not the only one](https://slate.com/culture/2018/02/star-trek-discovery-season-1-reviewed.html).

> There turned out to be too many of those twists in Discovery’s first season, and it was frustrating to watch as the writers sidled up to new, risky frontiers for exploration, only to suddenly change course right when things were starting to get interesting.

Season 1, Episode 7 is called “[Magic to Make the Sanest Man Go Mad](https://subslikescript.com/series/Star_Trek_Discovery-5171438/season-1/episode-7-Magic_to_Make_the_Sanest_Man_Go_Mad),” and it’s the most classically *Star Trek* of what I’ve seen. One of those stuck-in-a-time-loop stories which truly makes you want to die. What’s even better and slightly meta: playback kept resetting for me at exactly 21:26 and starting from the beginning while the cat kept stepping on the delete key and destroying this paragraph. I had to keep watching the man from *The* Fucking *Office* continually kill the captain after the crew parties to 250-year-old West Coast hip hop and *300*-year old Al Green all whilst writing this over again. I do not like Rainn Wilson invading my *Star Trek*. He gives Aquariuses a bad name and… beard. “Listen, petunia, I've been screwed over since the day I was born. I deserve this,” he says, and I wonder if in fact it is Rainn himself speaking of his invasion. He looks and sounds like a fucking incel. All of this makes me wonder if my entire problem with this show is simply that I do not particularly like its characters.

![USS Discovery](https://i.snap.as/hcE6DfB.png)

## The Vessel

Relying on *Memory Alpha* – a tried-and-true *Star Trek* fan resource – we can examine [the U.S.S. *Discovery*](https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/USS_Discovery), itself. I’m not so sure about this spore drive shit. If the NCC-1701 *Enterprise* was indeed [launched in 2245](https://www.startrek.com/database_article/enterprise), its existence would blatantly overlap with *Discovery*’s, now wouldn’t it? I don’t actually care all that much, but here are a few screenshots from [*Star Trek Online*](https://www.arcgames.com/en/games/star-trek-online/news/detail/10772124-the-discovery-lock-box!).

![USS Discovery - Star Trek Online](https://i.snap.as/HLtOMGj.jpg)

![USS Discovery - Star Trek Online](https://i.snap.as/X6cmK4K.jpg)

Note how much larger this *Crossfield­*-class ship is than the *Intrepid*-class from some [120 years into the future](https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Intrepid_class). Then again, the latter was designed for “long-range exploration missions” and *Discovery* is the fleet’s flagship(?) Its “most advanced ship,” at least. The inclusion of technologies like the [holodeck](https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Holodeck) and the [spore drive](https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Spore_drive) (perhaps the show’s most potent plot device,) though, are really stretching the canon timeline’s ability to accommodate them. The decision to [include the *Discovery*](https://www.arcgames.com/en/games/star-trek-online/news/detail/10772124-the-discovery-lock-box!) as a playable, top-tier ship in *Star Trek Online* is 100% a business one, surely. I’m not here to judge, though – after all, games are about having *fun*, right? One of *Star Trek*’s ironies has always been its existence in a capitalist society as an IP within a [debatably socialist future](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/24/opinion/make-it-so-star-trek-and-its-debt-to-revolutionary-socialism.html). (Everybody wants to see their [own ideal socioeconomic label](https://cameronharwick.com/blog/the-political-philosophy-of-star-trek/) in this future, it would seem.) “What makes *Star Trek*’s economics fundamentally different, and, in many ways, fundamentally incomprehensible to us, is that scarcity is no longer a factor,” says [Dale Franks](https://medium.com/@dalefranks/is-star-trek-socialist-83f766828b33). Today, though, *Star Trek* properties still require finite resources and labor to produce, and they always have. Atari spent [over $50 million](https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/atari-acquires-cryptic-studios) to acquire Cryptic Studios – the original developers of *Star Trek Online* – and *Discovery* supposedly cost “$[6-7 million per episode](https://variety.com/2016/tv/news/bryan-fuller-showrunner-star-trek-discovery-cbs-1201901398/).” Though the former is free-to-play, it’s filled with microtransactions and about 5 billion different currencies. When [*Star Trek.com* says](https://www.startrek.com/news/ten-years-of-star-trek-online) “*Star Trek Online* is best described as a permanent *Star Trek* convention,” they’re correct: **it is full of shit to buy**.

There is also *a lot* of combat, though *Discovery* seems to have struck a healthy balance between warfare and other intrigues. It is definitely *Trek* in many ways: redshirts die without any plot consequence and all the classic character flaw tropes are represented. There is the aforementioned time loop episode with fucking Harry Mudd and even a mirror universe arc beginning with “[Despite Yourself](https://subslikescript.com/series/Star_Trek_Discovery-5171438/season-1/episode-10-Despite_Yourself),” in which the crew actually responds to their new environment and does the research required to blend in with the Terran forces. This took an ancient *Star Trek* format and actually explored a new, interesting avenue within it (the time loop episode did not.) They even change the *Discovery*’s registry on the hull to read “[ISS Discovery](https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/ISS_Discovery)” instead of “USS.”

> Every moment is a test. Can you bury your heart? Can you hide your decency? Can you continue to pretend to be one of them? Even as, little by little, it kills the person you really are.

## Complaints

There’s a reason we all hate Captain Lorca, and why he says things like “[sometimes the ends justify terrible means](https://subslikescript.com/series/Star_Trek_Discovery-5171438/season-1/episode-11-The_Wolf_Inside)” and “[there’s no way we’re asking *these* neighbors for a cup of sugar](https://subslikescript.com/series/Star_Trek_Discovery-5171438/season-1/episode-10-Despite_Yourself).” I do not believe in Spoilers, but there’s not much reason for me to tell you why, specifically. Perhaps it is racist and/or misogynist to say so, but I found it difficult to get as attached to *Discovery*’s characters as I have to those of series past. Michael is great, of course, though my girlfriend Sierra surmised that her purpose in the show is to illustrate that “nobody listens to black women.” Sierra was also quite aggravated by the misunderstanding and mistreatment of the tardigrade. When Paul Stamets mentioned that his uncle Everett participated in a Beatles cover band, we both despaired, for we discovered an entry in *Memory Alpha* for “[The Beatles](https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/The_Beatles).” If I were to standardize a system of measurement for my television ratings, *Discovery*’s **cringe factor** would be 9/10. The holodeck hasn’t been invented yet!

Also, CBS All Access’ user interface is the worst I’ve ever seen from a streaming service, across iOS, desktop browser, and my Samsung television. It’s impossible to scrub, really, or to dictate a preference for high definition. One cannot navigate backward between episodes without re-searching the title and navigating through an incredibly clunky menu sequence. I was able to cast to both my Samsung TV and Sierra’s Chromecast from my iPhone, at least.

![Star Trek Discovery - CBS All Access](https://i.snap.as/WvjZPUy.jpg)

## Compliments

Despite its failings (including Rainn Wilson,) *Discovery*’s acting is superb. [James Frain as Sarek](https://www.startrek.com/article/james-frain-joins-discovery-as-sarek), especially, is the best of the three. I thought it was especially thoughtful that for the most part (at least in Season 1,) the Klingons *actually spoke Klingon* to each other. Given that [Dr. Marc Okrand](https://www.kli.org/about-klingon/klingon-history/) spent the time and effort to construct a fully-functional Klingon language, it seems only reasonable to include as much of it as possible. I also love [Hugh Culber](https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Hugh_Culber)’s doctor’s uniform and the “cinematic” cinematography of the whole thing. It’s very much an action show, yet not quite obnoxious.

So, **should \*Star Trek\* die**? Perhaps it shows my extreme bias, but no, I do not think it need perish quite yet. From my (white, male, cishet) perspective, *Discovery* does an okay job at remaining thoroughly *Trek* whilst [acknowledging the present context’s social issues](https://www.newyorker.com/tech/annals-of-technology/for-alt-right-trolls-star-trek-discovery-is-an-unsafe-space). It remains a very capitalist enterprise and wholesomely cringey generation X cultural mastodon, but I think it’s still worth our time.

**So I am super curious that you mentioned Markdown as something that saved you from fiddling your life away. Can you go more into that?**

I started an online magazine four years ago originally on WordPress. I thought I knew something about web development, but honestly I did not. It ended up becoming a fixation on trying to make something *technically* different from what I'd seen done with WordPress, which detracted heavily from my Editorial duties over the years. I'm on the OCD spectrum so I just couldn't let it go. I spent thousands of hours fiddling with different themes and formatting within those themes, and what I ended up with was a mess. I would make changes that would break old posts, so I'd go back and fix those, only to make more changes days/weeks/months later and have to go back again. I'd known vaguely about Markdown, but it wasn't until it was mentioned in the WordPress dev Slack that I really considered it seriously as a way out of what I'd been doing. I realized that its inherit limitations were actually very good for me - that I needed a limited system to constrain my workflow to keep myself on task. Finally, in late-2018, I started to convert our old content to Markdown and essentially haven't looked back since.

**Did it take a while for you to accept Markdown's limitations? Was there a turning point for you? Did you look for a Markdown plugin on WordPress to help after making the change? I imagine there's something like that out there.**

There are third-party plugins, yes, but I believe the new WordPress editor now supports "[markdown blocks](https://wordpress.com/support/wordpress-editor/blocks/markdown-block/)," which is sortof handy for those who want to continue in that direction. The turning point was probably when we ran out of money and lost our account with our hosting provider. I was left with an old external HD full of old backups and an empty domain. I'd already started moving that direction within WordPress (largely because of the [Gutenberg editor project](https://wptavern.com/wordpress-core-editor-team-publishes-ui-prototype-for-gutenberg-an-experimental-block-based-editor),) but losing the site in its entirety was what I really needed to push us into a more modern, progressive CMS. Honestly, Markdown is capable of everything we *actually* need and nothing more. I'd like to think I was able to realize this from the beginning.

**So you're left with an old external HD full of old backups and an empty domain. Talk to me about the process then of finding that modern, progressive CMS. Did you have a vague idea of what you were looking for? I imagine getting those backups ready for whatever you were going to choose as another process entirely.**

I actually decided to ditch the backups and just move forward with a different Editorial direction (the project has since been more or less put on hiatus.) I knew Markdown had to be involved and that I never wanted to look at anything like WordPress' dashboard ever again. I played around with a local Ghost instance but just didn't *feel* anything for it, if that makes sense. I'd already moved my [personal blog](http://bilge.world) to Write.As months before and eventually realized that it was just what [*Extratone*](http://extratone) needed - so far, I've only imported my own contributions and the most recent work from others.

**Could you explain what you mean by *feeling* something for a piece of software? I noticed this in your [recent post](https://bilge.world/poweruser-tips-software-shortcuts) on your personal blog and what I enjoyed about it so much. There's an enthusiasm about the software you do recommend that jumps through the screen. I want to use [Bear](https://bear.app/) after reading your post.**

I'm glad to hear that! I suppose it dates back to my upbringing on a farm in rural Missouri, where I felt a real affection for - and attachment to - our tractors, combine, and such. When one cares about their work, I think it's inevitable for them to be emotionally invested in the tools they use to accomplish it every day. During my brief stint in IT in the beginning of 2019, I saw a lot of users struggling with outdated and ridiculously unintuitive software throughout their entire workday and it made me really appreciate the idea of "good workflow." I'm not really a developer, but I believe software can always be better because I've seen it. As an End User of sorts with not much cash, I feel like my main contribution back to developers should be celebrating their good work. This is an idea I feel I do not encounter enough in day-to-day life.

**As someone who also had a brief stint in IT, I totally agree with the struggles people go through because of outdated & unintuitive software. But IT also made me realize how much of software is personal — someone will want a solution that's unintuitive to you but is intuitive to them. You learn a lot of empathy from that.**

**I am intrigued by your last point there — why don't you think you encounter the idea of celebrating software developers enough in day-to-day life?**

I suppose specifically I mean I don't see enough celebration of *good* development. It's hard to challenge the personal workflow of anyone, yes, but I hope folks will continue to want to better their lives with new solutions. As I mentioned in my Tips post, Microsoft Word is a great specific example of software that simply [*should not* be used anymore](https://slate.com/technology/2012/04/microsoft-word-is-cumbersome-inefficient-and-obsolete-its-time-for-it-to-die.html) - especially in composition for The Web. Not that Word is *celebrated*, necessarily, but **its alternatives are not**. It should be noted that I have no specific authority in this matter other than years of experience with - and enjoyment of - playing around with software. I just think that End Users deserve better than they get, and awareness of new/different software is a huge part of the problem. Making average people aware of better solutions should be the primary function of special interest tech journalism, IMO. 

**Great point about Microsoft Word. I don't even remember the last time I seriously used it — high school maybe? And like you said, discovery can be an issue to the adoption of these alternative tools. So are there any common patterns you've noticed as to how you've come about these software alternatives that you now use? Patterns that someone could adopt?**

It's not that I slave away, but it does take a lot of time to discover them. The simple answer is: I drink a lot of caffeine and hyperfixate on the internet. I'm not sure it's something the average user should *want* to adopt, but if they do, they should be [on Mastodon](http://joinmastodon.org). They should be googling "alternatives to..." regularly, and they should worship Free and Open Source Software. Accepting that you never have to settle for one piece of software is probably the beginning. For lack of a better term, I just love *playing around* with software. That's not something I would advocate for my old clients or other End Users - I would rather find out myself and then present a list of alternatives in an entertaining way. I hope that's an appropriate and sufficient answer hehe.

**No that's great! The acceptance of never having to settle for one piece of software is at once valuable and challenging to adopt. If you keep switching you could be a sort of software vagabond who throws their data into a rucksack to head to the next viable platform. I've always had trouble trying to find the proper balance between playing around with software & learning a tool well enough that it can be useful. How have you personally navigated that? I could imagine your foray into & out of Wordpress as an example.**

It's always a challenge when trying new things. I obsess over different ways to accomplish tasks. I've probably signed *Extratone* for 15 different newsletter services (including [Buttondown](http://buttondown.email) today) though I haven't actually written a single edition of our newsletter in nearly two years. I think it's only recently that I've been able to look at these habits from a reasonable perspective. As in, I am now able to finally differentiate between playing and being productive, but it took some 15 years. Self-awareness of one's actual progress is key. Asking questions like *why am I actually doing this - for profit or for play?* Differentiating between these two is something someone like me will always struggle with, I think.

**The distinction between playing and being productive can be quite blurry. I sometimes find that playing around with a piece of software can lead to a productive use of it. How about you? Did you start with the idea of creating *Extratone* first and then tried to find the right software to fit the job? Or did you start playing around with Wordpress and then the idea of the digital publication took form soon after?**

That's an insightful supposition. I actually tried to launch an online magazine before *Extratone* with virtually zero editorial focus along with a standalone podcast that I'd been hosting on WordPress for years. I originally began playing around with WordPress sites in my early adolescence, so you could say it all culminated in the idea. It took maturity to realize that I actually wanted to build a platform for *other* voices rather than continue to invest in my own. I'd like to believe that was all enabled by the playing hehe.

**So what lead you to the conclusion of building a platform for other voices? Especially curious from the *maturity* angle. Because you still have a [personal blog](https://bilge.world/), so it doesn't feel like you've completely neglected your personal voice. But would you consider that as not the same investment of time & effort that you'd put into something like *Extratone*?**

I should be clear that I have *not* accomplished what I set out to do with *Extratone*. After a fairly big personal trauma in 2015, I had a bit of an existential crisis and realized that I had surrounded myself with so many talented (in a particularly relevant way) online friends who were producing all sorts of incredible content - music and videos, mostly. I realized that I was better at editing and other platform duties than I was at writing, and that perhaps the online communities I was astride could be provided a single banner to give themselves. In that sense, I haven't figured out how to do what I set out to yet. Ideally, my byline would be completely gone from *Extratone*, so I've more or less put it on hold until I figure out how to accomplish that. Turning it into a somewhat profitable media company is still my biggest long-term life goal.

**The curatorial characteristic you describe is underrated, even though the "everyone is a curator" idea is jammed down our throats all the time. There's something about this curation on a person-to-person level that still has lots of room for experimentation. On that subject, do you have any examples of communities, sites, or models that guide where you'd want *Extratone* to go?**

My citable aspirations in that regard have been somewhat superficial, I'm afraid. From a technical perspective, I really admired what Joshua Topolsky was [trying to do](https://www.niemanlab.org/2016/08/newsonomics-sketching-in-the-details-of-josh-topolskys-new-outline/) with [*The Outline*](http://theoutline.com) - which just [closed this month](https://www.niemanlab.org/2020/04/the-outline-an-attempt-to-build-a-bolder-kind-of-news-site-appears-to-have-met-its-end/), actually. They built their own CMS including a bespoke advertising delivery platform which really looked *great* but they just [couldn't figure out](https://www.niemanlab.org/2018/10/the-outline-built-itself-on-being-weird-but-is-it-weird-enough-to-survive/) a sustainable editorial focus. In my fantasy world, I have the connections and digital media insight of Topolsky and know how to apply them in a way that supports *our* community because I don't see any one brand popping up any substantial umbrellas over the electronic musicians I know. (It wasn't until "too late" that I realized *Extratone*'s sole editorial focus should have been electronic music all along.) I read a lot about media but I'm pretty picky as far as hero worship goes when it comes to my own professional goals. I once promised that *Extratone* would *never* run ads, so I could see some sort of non-profit classification working out in our future. I believe I could be an excellent curator - I'm just not quite sure how to get there yet.

**I think you're a great curator — had to ask that question of influence because I think you have a unique curatorial presence on the web. Just saw you tweet about [tractordata.com](https://www.tractordata.com/). Who else would recommend that? Love it. That's why I thought [Are.na](https://are.na/) would be right up your alley.**

**So you emphasized "*our* community" there — what do you define as your community in that broader context?**

Well thank you! That's a question I'm still struggling to define. **Electronic music** is about as far as I've gotten. I met most of my talented friends on Twitter over the past 10 years or so and have tried to contain them in a [list](https://twitter.com/i/lists/1032269790616858625) before. There are innate challenges in defining such a creative community - I have done my best to label without being constricting, but it's definitely difficult trying to figure out how to provide a flag which everyone feels comfortable flying. I still think the best I've done to articulate what I'm trying to say was for [*Extratone*'s About page](https://extratone.com/about). Most of the folks I'm talking about are used to hustling their own brand so it's been a real challenge working on the right way to reach out.

**A flag which everyone feels comfortable flying — that's a great way to put it. What I find interesting about your internet presence is that you defy the idea of flying just a single flag. Along with *Extratone* you have [multiple](https://anchor.fm/extratone) [podcasts](https://anchor.fm/davidblue), [multiple](https://bilge.world/) [blogs](https://dieselgoth.com/), and now you're starting a [Motorsports & Tech dedicated Mastodon instance](https://mstd.racing/).**

**I've been thinking a lot lately about how important it is to have many online buckets to put your ideas in. One just feels too limiting, especially if it's solely linked to your legal identity. How do you think about this matter of identity & expression with your own online presence?**

That's a very good question. I can't take credit for [mastd.racing](https://mastd.racing), actually - I'm not sure who created that server but it's administered by an account called [RaceControl](https://mastd.racing/@RaceControl). You've arrived at another one of my biggest challenges. Consolidating my interests has always been a problem, especially on The Web. Age has definitely helped narrow them down a bit, but I still can't help myself sometimes. I think it's ended up alienating a lot of my followers on social because I have a hard time posting just within my niche(s). I'm not so sure how to feel about this, honestly. One could argue that I should post whatever I want, whenever, but *consider your audience* is also a concept I can no longer ignore. If anything, I need to learn to let myself be limited a bit *more* by those buckets. Once again, *Extratone* is a good example of this - I should've never published app reviews there, but I did. We're all learning, I suppose.

**Do you feel like you have to even learn to limit yourself on your [personal blog](https://bilge.world/)? It seems like a personal blog can act as the release valve — a way of getting around cornering yourself into the niches that *Extratone* and other projects require. You can freely write about [pens](https://bilge.world/preferred-writing-instruments) and [Picard](https://bilge.world/star-trek-picard-review) without feeling constrained to a single subject.**

I think I'm just now coming around to understanding personal blogging and the freedom that entails. It's been a long while since I've had the urge to write about things on which I don't consider myself at least somewhat of an authority. I think - like many people - I originally just used my personal blog as a guinea pig for messing around with themes, and I'm just now actually catching up on some of the lesser items on my "to-write" list. Since we've begun talking I've begun building my blogs bookmark folder back up and following the [#100DaystoOffload](https://100daystooffload.com/) challenge, which I find immensely impressive. I can't say I'm quite up to it, personally, but I definitely plan on opening up the taps a bit more. (I also don't want to flood [read.write.as](https://read.write.as/) with too many joke posts ya know hehe.)

**That's awesome! You're reminding me of the interesting relationship between writing & tinkering when it comes to blogs. They both feed into each other in a strange way. Before, when my blog was on Wordpress, I didn't care about tinkering around — writing was my sole focus. When I moved to my new blog, however, I found myself shift towards creating apps that extend my blog and messing around with its CSS. So it's interesting that you've gone the opposite way, publishing more instead of solely tinkering.**

**What has awoken the urge for you to tackle those items on your personal "to-write" list? To open up those taps a bit more? Because I can see the publication mindset, being somewhat of an authority, getting in the way.**

That is interesting. I'm wondering how many people are in each of our camps. I hate to be so topical, but the pandemic and being home constantly has definitely contributed. I've also begun to learn to let things go, which is an essential skill. Being able to actually kill work when it needs to die is the real secret. I just built up the strength to delete the rest of my 2019 list a few weeks ago.

**I wonder also! And hey, no problem bringing up the current situation. I think it's making me write more also.**

**Want to drill into that practice of letting go as an essential skill for blogging. As a final question for this chat, how have you gone about the decision of keeping ideas that you've had for a long time and when to let them go? It's been something I've been struggling with for recently as ideas for blog posts start to pile up.**

Self-curation is definitely tough. Generally, it's very hard to let things go - especially when I've progressed at all significantly into research/first drafting, but I know when to kill something if I reread and am unable to immediately see where I was going. I've noticed that trying to rekindle interest or momentum in a topic is unusually not a worthwhile use of time in my case. If I can't get my rhythm back fairly early in, I am very unlikely to, ever. That said, I think it's also important to *forgive yourself* for investing time in something that won't work out - otherwise, you will settle for less than what you originally intended and release something you won't be happy with. 

Thank you so much for your time! I really enjoyed this!

**Forgive and forget! That's a great point about rekindling an interest being a sign of letting go of an idea. I've done that too many times. This has been a blast to chat virtually David — really enjoyed your thoughts and am looking forward to future blog posts and installments of *Extratone*!**

# Music

I'm not an authority on electronic music, but I am surrounded by musician friends of a particular creativity and I am the creator of an electronic music magazine called [*Extratone*](https://extratone.com). I also curate the music podcast [*Extratone Radio*](http://extratone.com/radio).

The result is a fairly good representation of what I was doing musically at the time and probably the most dynamically interesting of all the recordings I've captured. The instrument itself has a very particular dreamy quality that I've never heard on any other.

# Star Trek: Jowls

![Star Trek Jowls](https://i.snap.as/v7sn60X.png)

## A highly-informed analysis.

He named his dog Number One. His eyebag game disastrous. The Romulans are in a Borg Cube. They’re flirting in The Cube. It’s a Sex Cube. Its shields are very loud, now. They’re smoking weed on Weed Road. There is simply not enough runtime for a truly episodic television show anymore, is there? A Borg Romulan Scott. (Imagine Borg snot.) *The shear fucking hubris*. There’s the F word again. *I didn’t know Romulans could be so hot*. Jesus Christ. “I never really cared for science fiction – I just didn’t *get* it,” says Picard. Very funny, folks.

Did he drop something or...? *Paradigmatic*. CBS’ closed captions are janky and I’m getting older by the second. They are in the Sex Cube again. The Star Trek OS looks like it has annoying notifications. A son? Using the term *Quest*. This is segregation. The *Nightingale* was a [slave ship](http://www.bruzelius.info/Nautica/Ships/Clippers/Nightingale%281851%29.html). This is not lost on me. Spanish speaking! Nothing about operating these ships is visceral at all. Hey! Jeri Ryan! These CBS All Access ads are absolutely bizarre. Icheb is here!? Jesus what a coincidence. Oh.

![Star Trek Jowls](https://i.snap.as/m7hZ1W0.png)

TECHNO FUTURE. That head tilt was sudden. Romulans are freaking out in English, for some reason. Colonel Jane - Sterling’s young wife - is still a bitch. What a surprise. I still haven’t gotten tired of the introductory credits’ theme. *Pissant*, really? “And now the windmills have turned out to be giants.” I have no idea what that’s referencing. Admirals should not say *shut the fuck up*. The holograms are just different levels of Scottish according to their class. Did they do this just to make sure Scots continued to be represented in *Star Trek*? Why does Rios have so many pips? What rank would he be if he put all of them on? God? **ALISON PILL**. Dr. Pill. 

> Fear is the great destroyer.

Coordinated bonk. “We’re at a threshold” is not political at all. If I was watching this show by the week, I would be very frustrated by its pace. Very sad about the Orchid deaths. They were cute. They mentioned the Picard Maneuver correctly. Jonathan Frakes directed this. Seven of Nine just said “same,” but we will forgive Brent Spiner for aging and - I hope - for [dying](https://www.digitalspy.com/tv/ustv/a31959862/star-trek-picard-brent-spiner-finished-playing-data/). 

I think we probably should’ve let ourselves let Picard die.

# Preferred Writing Instruments

![Kaweco Skyline Sport](https://i.snap.as/1hE6Pm3.jpg)

It’s very pretentious to talk about pens, I agree, but I believe there’s a level of pen pretentiousness which is worth sharing with the writing masses. I continually encounter people in both personal and professional settings using - and [often worshipping](https://theoutline.com/post/875/bic-cristal-pen-gold-standard) - very shitty pens. I'm not going to pretend spending $15 on a pen has not become a novel or ridiculous idea in contemporary culture, but if you're willing, this is one of those areas where some retrospective can lead to real pleasantnesss. Here are some of the tools I've owned. (I'll be linking heavily to *The Pen Addict* in this post. It's all we've got. Sorry.)

![Parker Jotter](https://i.snap.as/r73oOXr.jpg)

## Parker Jotter

I believe everyone on Earth should own a [Parker Jotter](http://www.officedepot.com/a/products/9114371/Parker-Jotter-Gel-Pen-Medium-Point/). It's a slim, small ballpoint designed for sketching with a clicking action that just about everyone loves. I have owned and lost many and I will continue to for the rest of my writing life. I cannot even begin to communicate how worth it $16.99 is to never write with another disposable ballpoint ever again. They're tough, light, and beautiful. Sarah Read for [*The Pen Addict*](https://www.penaddict.com/blog/2017/7/6/parker-jotter-ballpoint-pen-review):

> If you're primarily a fountain pen user, but you acknowledge the occasional need for a ballpoint, this really is the perfect one. It looks and feels like you're spoiling yourself, but the price is low enough that you'll still have to add a fountain pen to your cart to get free shipping.

![Pilot Metropolitan](https://i.snap.as/9JgGeqU.jpg)

## Pilot Metropolitan

The [Pilot Metropolitan](https://www.gouletpens.com/collections/pilot-metropolitan-fountain-pens/products/pilot-metropolitan-fountain-pen-silver-dots) has been *the* entry-level fountain pen for all of time as far as I know. Google for reviews and you'll find praises across the blog spectrum - from [*Little Coffee Fox*](https://littlecoffeefox.com/pilot-metropolitan-review) to [*Writing For Pain and Pleasure*](https://writingforpainandpleasure.com/2018/04/19/is-there-anything-new-to-say-about-the-pilot-metropolitan) to [*The Gentleman Stationer*](https://www.gentlemanstationer.com/blog/2014/10/31/one-week-with-the-pilot-metropolitan). "I'm not sure there is anything on the market that even approaches a pen of this quality for $15.00," says the latter. Testimony from the first:

> I love how the Pilot Metropolitan feels in my hand. The brass body is cold and weighty while you write without becoming a burden to use. Despite its low cost, the look and feel of this pen will be sure to leave an impression on your friends and coworkers.

[*The Pen Addict* argues for the next pen](https://www.penaddict.com/blog/2013/6/10/pilot-metropolitan-fountain-pen-review) on my list as The Ultimate Beginner, but I'll stick with the Metropolitan. It's a little unorthodox, actually - it doesn't feel quite as substantial as the other fountain pens I've used in my time, but it's a blast.

![Lamy Safari](https://i.snap.as/aZ4MbnM.jpg)

## Lamy Safari

The modern alternative to the Pilot Metropolitan, the [Lamy Safari](https://www.gouletpens.com/collections/lamy-safari-fountain-pens/products/lamy-safari-fountain-pen-red) is the *coolest* instrument on this list to own, but it *is* generally twice the price. Though I liked being *seen* with the Safari more than the Metropolitan, and its writing experience is more conventional in terms of what to expect from other composite fountain pens, I still think the Metropolitan is more fun to use. Instead of reading what I have to say, though, check out the only words about any of these pens I spied in a major publication. For [*The Strategist*](https://nymag.com/strategist/article/lamy-safari-fountain-pen-review.html), David Notis writes:

> Fountain pens can be complicated and intimidating, but the Safari was designed to be approachable. (It was apparently [originally meant](https://www.penheaven.co.uk/blog/success-story-lamy-safari-fountain-pen/) to help teach proper handwriting to schoolchildren). Pen enthusiasts often recommend it as a great “starter” fountain pen, which I’ve found to be spot-on. [...]

> Not that I’m suddenly an expert, but there *is* something special about writing with a fountain pen. The steady flow of ink is so expressive; it somehow makes the weird, messy quirks of my handwriting feel intentional. 

To be honest, I feel like I could've done without my Safari, but I did actually write with it quite extensively. Here are two more opinions: [*The Gentleman Stationer*](https://www.gentlemanstationer.com/blog/2015/2/13/basic-black-one-week-with-the-lamy-safari) and [*Little Coffee Fox*](https://littlecoffeefox.com/lamy-safari-fountain-pen-review).

![Kaweco Classic Sport](https://i.snap.as/eRzvopT.jpg)

## Kaweco

Huge bias here: I adore Kaweco as a company. I first bought a [Mint Skyline Sport](https://www.gouletpens.com/products/kaweco-skyline-sport-fountain-pen-mint) (the featured image of this post) in 2016 and I fell in love. I love the [breeziness of their colors](https://www.instagram.com/p/BwRA5XnDrGM). I love how Germanic their old logo is and how anything you read about their history is inevitably found on a website looking [like this](http://dirck.delint.ca/beta/?page_id=6610). As Susan M. Pigott points out for *The Pen Addict*, the plastic Sport series can be a bit lacking in refinement. "The Skyline Sport is made of plastic, and it feels rather cheap in the hand," she says. Unfortunately, my [white Classic Sport](https://www.gouletpens.com/products/kaweco-classic-sport-fountain-pen-white) had the same problem, though I also adored it. From [Shashwat Vardhana](https://medium.com/shashwats-pen-reviews/kaweco-classic-sport-review-8005f9e4a478):

> If you have small to medium sized hands and like the screw cap action, you should most certainly go for this pen. While it might not be the best writer of its class, its reliability is  absolute and I have never had any complaints with the pen in this aspect.

![Kaweco Steel Sport](https://i.snap.as/60EsScw.jpg)

![Kaweco Steel Sport](https://i.snap.as/JcoAaGu.jpg)

My baby - my ultimate pen acquisition - was my [Kaweco Steel Sport](https://www.jetpens.com/Kaweco-Steel-Sport-Fountain-Pen-Fine-Nib/pd/20288). I bought it in person with cash at [Pen Place](https://www.penplace.com/products/kaweco-steel-sport-fountain-pen) in Kansas City, and it was by far my favorite writing instrument of all time. As far as I'm concerned, this is as high as pens get. Find yourself in the position to buy one and you will be satisfied forever. From [*The Pen Addict*](https://www.penaddict.com/blog/2019/7/29/kaweco-steel-sport-fountain-pen-review):

> The Steel Sport features a - wait for it - stainless steel barrel. What  is it about stainless steel that I love so much in pens? It tends to  land in a barrel weight sweet spot that is heavier than aluminum, and  lighter than copper and brass. [...]
>
> Stainless steel has a density and warmth that I enjoy in a pen barrel.  It is also practically indestructible, which is what I want in a pocket  pen.

If you write by hand, you should treat yourself to one of these instruments. If you'd like to write *more* by hand, you **definitely** should. A good pen will have you looking for excuses to write.

# Dirty Dave’s Poweruser Tips

![Face Computer](https://i.snap.as/6rYyd5x.png)

I don’t want you to think this is just another listicle to mark as spam or ignore completely – though it technically is, I suppose. I know how it looks… because I’ve run into many of them and have been just as irritated as you. In fact, I would be so bold as to presume I’ve run into *many many* more than you have simply because a primary hobby of mine has always been Just Trying to Do Things On The Computer without any academic authority or hands-on training. This is a way of life for my generation and those proceeding it, yes, but I promise you that I have gone far, far deeper than the vast majority of anyone you know. What I’m ultimately trying to do here is to spare you the hundreds – perhaps *thousands* – of hours I have had to spend mulling through shitty workflows throughout my childhood and adulthood before I stumbled upon Good Practices (i.e. Better Ways to Do Things.)

<iframe src="https://anchor.fm/davidblue/embed/episodes/Dirty-Daves-Poweruser-Tips-edguog" height="102px" width="400px" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe>

I want you to come away from this list feeling as liberated and powerful as I do now when I’m On My Computer without any condescension or tedium. Unfortunately, there’s probably going to be some of both, so please stick with me and don’t take it personally. I do *a lot* of online reading, writing, and fiddling. I’ve been compelled to do these things in one form or another since very early childhood, and what follows could be described as a list of my favorite tools to accomplish things. Almost all of them are entirely free to use and the vast majority of them are easily and beautifully functional as well. They are what I suggest for my own mother to use, for what that’s worth, and I would argue sincerely for their extreme importance. *Don’t waste your life on bad software.*

![Enpass Password Manager](https://i.snap.as/fJirMl4.png)

## You Need a Password Manager

In 2020, password managers are no longer optional for digital life. **They are mandatory**. If you only ever heed a single piece of my advice, ever, *please* make it this one. [Most password managers available](https://www.pcmag.com/picks/the-best-password-managers) are secure, cross-platform, optionally cloud-synced tools that help you generate, store, and organize digital credentials. More likely than not, you’re already using one in your favorite browser. On MacOS and iOS, Safari is linked to a service called Keychain, which is – functionally – a robust password manager. On signup for a given website or service, Safari should prompt you to automatically generate secure, complex passwords to store in Keychain. Generally, it’s pretty smart about knowing when it’s time to retrieve the credentials with Touch-ID, but for when it *isn’t*, you should know [how to manually retrieve passwords from Keychain](https://support.apple.com/guide/keychain-access/what-is-keychain-access-kyca1083/mac). If you’re deeply enough embedded into the Mac ecosystem, you can feel free to continue to rely on this process as long as you know how to help yourself when it fails. I’m not going to tell you who to trust, but I do *almost* actually believe in Apple’s commitment to securing user data, if only because of the way their incentives are aligned (in contrast with those in front of data-funded organizations like Google.)

If you’re using a Windows Home Machine and/or an Android smartphone, I believe it’s more urgent that you find a standalone password management solution immediately. I use a gorgeous app called [Enpass](https://www.enpass.io/) to store all of my passwords as well as my bank credentials, credit cards, driver’s license information, and anything else I might need to keep handy, securely. I can use virtually any cloud or file-sharing service to keep my “vaults” synced between all of my devices: Microsoft OneDrive, Google Drive, Dropbox, iCloud, Box, etc, and I also regularly create encrypted local backups just in case. I can even *share* end-to-end encrypted credentials with another device or Enpass installation. I migrated to Enpass two years ago after using [1Password](https://www.consumerreports.org/password-managers/best-password-managers-review-digital-security-privacy-ease-of-use/) for nearly 10. It was intuitive and virtually seamless, as such things in software tend to be these days, and as a result, I haven’t had to memorize a single password since my adolescence. Enpass allows me to create custom login templates for quick differentiation when creating new entries as well as picturized categories and tags. With one click, even the icon can be pulled from a given URL’s favicon to help keep my vault looking visually itemized. It also includes presets for a hundred services or so – from Google to Wix to Yahoo! Japan.

## Total Recall with a Clipboard Manager

Imagine if everything you had ever copied (as in **Ctrl-C**) were listed in linear order, [easily and instantly searchable](https://vimeo.com/407790756) via a single global keyboard shortcut (**Alt-`**) and navigable with the arrow keys. Imagine if you could then export an archive of your clipboard so *nothing* could ever be lost. Imagine clipboard *tabs* that are easily switchable. [CopyQ](https://hluk.github.io/CopyQ/) – an “advanced clipboard manager” – is one of my favorite software discoveries of all time. Some workdays, I use it literally hundreds of instances in my workflow. It is difficult to describe how much more useful it makes the clipboard feature – something we’ve all been using for decades, now. For someone like me who [copies a ridiculous amount of links every day](https://extratone.com/three-years-of-good-reads), CopyQ’s functionality has truly become *life-changing*.

![Windows 10 Keyboard Shortcuts - General](https://i.snap.as/G4JSrQb.png)

## Alt-D and Other Keyboard Shortcuts

Somehow, I did not discover **Alt-D** until 2018, which means that I had spent the entirety of my 24 years since *triple-clicking* to select every single URL I’d ever copied. I built a media company this way, and I can’t believe nobody told me about this shortcut. Open any given web browser, use **Alt-D**, and your selection will move to the URL in the address bar on top of the page. It’s very possible this will be of little use to you, but anyone who regularly shares or copies links will save themselves *so* much time. I felt the same way when I discovered text navigation with **Alt**, **Shift**, **Ctrl** + the arrow keys. Most of these are cross-platform, but I am specifically focusing on [Windows shortcuts](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12445/windows-keyboard-shortcuts) for this piece because that’s what I’m currently using.

### Arrow key-related shortcuts 

·    **Shift** in conjunction with the arrow keys selects text in a document surrounding the cursor.

·    **Alt** in conjunction with the arrow keys allows one to go forward or backward in a browser.

·    **Ctrl** in conjunction with the arrow keys allows one to navigate text by word.

Virtually all of the “Windows logo key” shortcuts are usable in day-to-day workflows. I use **Win-D** to immediately minimize all windows and show the desktop on the regular. Microsoft is [currently testing](https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/17/21224904/microsoft-windows-10-launcher-powertoy-spotlight-alfred-details) a feature like MacOS’ spotlight which is triggered with this key.

> Designed to replace the existing Win + R shortcut, the new launcher will include options to quickly search apps and files across Windows and support for plugins like calculators, dictionaries, and search engines.

We can only hope this feature will be as useful as spotlight (which is triggered with **⌘-Spacebar** for you Mac users,) and will be implemented as standard as soon as possible. If you’re not already using basic shortcuts for functions like closing tabs/windows and cut/copy/pasting text, I’d advise you to begin as soon as possible. It can be hard to commit, but I promise it’ll make your life better. Try printing out a list of shortcuts for your particular operating system to keep by your workspace and/or find or create an image of the list to set as your [desktop background](http://extratone.wiki/net/index.php/s/2Pn5H32yYYrm3bG) for a while.

## Learn Markdown Immediately

While we’re on the subject of text – and hopefully without finding ourselves exploring [the entire history of word processing](https://medium.com/redletters/evernote-dropbox-paper-and-the-history-of-word-processing-9407b2c7afba) – I’d like to evangelize what very well might be the Ultimate Formatting Language for digital text. It’s called [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax), and it’s something you’ve likely already used in one form or another. Technically, Markdown is “[a text-to-HTML conversion tool for web writers](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/),” but – more importantly – it’s a method of stylizing text which is as simple as possible, easy to universalize, and already quite popular. While *Vice* argues that Markdown is a “[power-user tool](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/pa7nbn/slacks-new-rich-text-editor-shows-why-markdown-still-scares-people),” I’d suggest that it’s one everybody should make use of. Though I am currently writing this in Word (for the first time in a good while,) I’m going to [pay for it later](https://slate.com/technology/2012/04/microsoft-word-is-cumbersome-inefficient-and-obsolete-its-time-for-it-to-die.html). 

> A Word file is the story-fax of the early 21st century: cumbersome, inefficient, and a relic of obsolete assumptions about technology.

“[[Markdown\] has all the advantages of plain text, but with the organizational power of a word processor](https://lifehacker.com/what-is-markdown-and-why-is-it-better-for-my-to-do-lis-5943320),” says *Lifehacker*. From [Ian Lurie](https://www.portent.com/blog/copywriting/use-markdown-now.htm):

> I once had to convert a Word document to a web page.
>
> Once.
>
> After spending hours deleting mso-style blocks and cleaning up thousands of lines of crap, I swore (and swore, and swore) that I’d never do that again.
>
> So I moved to [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax). For a writer who publishes mostly to the web, it’s perfect.

Before I committed to writing in Markdown and moved *Extratone* to [Write.As](https://write.as/about) – a wonderfully simple, open-source web CMS entirely based on Markdown – I really struggled with text formatting on [our old WordPress-based site](http://web.archive.org/web/20190126095147/http:/www.extratone.com/), spending hours cleaning up text from Word, Apple Notes, Dropbox Paper, and Google Docs. Now, WordPress [natively supports Markdown](https://wordpress.com/support/can-i-use-markdown-on-wordpress-com/) along with [Ghost](https://ghost.org/faq/using-markdown/), [Slack](https://slack.com/help/articles/202288908-Format-your-messages), [Discord](https://support.discordapp.com/hc/en-us/articles/210298617-Markdown-Text-101-Chat-Formatting-Bold-Italic-Underline-), [Tumblr](https://marco.org/2008/11/14/in-tumblrs-preferences-screen-you-can-specify), and more.
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">OKAY, YOU GUYS WERE RIGHT ABOUT BEAR...<br><br>the whole world was right about Bear...<br><br>I&#39;m not sure if I&#39;ve ever seen a more beautiful text editor and I&#39;ve seen A LOT. <a href="https://t.co/8SzGiBgoYt">pic.twitter.com/8SzGiBgoYt</a></p>&mdash; David Blue (@NeoYokel) <a href="https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/1063486573197561857?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 16, 2018</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script> 
*Mashable* published [a formidable list](https://mashable.com/2013/06/24/markdown-tools/) of Markdown editors in 2013, but many are since significantly out of date. Instead, I’d refer you to @awwsmm’s “[State of Markdown Editors 2019](https://dev.to/awwsmm/state-of-markdown-editors-2019-2k49),” which suggests [Joplin](https://joplinapp.org/) as the winning pick. Joplin is open-source and syncs across devices using your preferred cloud service, but it requires that all notes be written in a monospace typeface, which I do not prefer. If you have a MacOS-running machine and/or an iOS-running smartphone, you *must* download and try an application called [Bear](https://bear.app/). It is quite simply the [most beautiful](https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/1063486573197561857) piece of software – aesthetically and functionally – that I have ever seen, and therefore the most beautiful possible execution of a Markdown Editor. From [*The Verge*’s Dieter Bohn](https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/2/14785264/evernote-replacement-bear-app):

> Bear uses a simple three-paned design. The largest column is devoted to your current note. A smaller column to the left contains your notes in reverse-chronological order, topped by a search bar. The left-most column contains notes that you’ve pinned, as well as any tags you’ve created to organize your notes — #recipes, for example. I spent years trying to sort my notes into notebooks in Evernote, only to learn that what I really needed was a faster search box.

<div style="padding:56.25% 0 0 0;position:relative;"><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/192615466?color=00006b&title=0&byline=0&portrait=0" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><script src="https://player.vimeo.com/api/player.js"></script>

As much as I despise the term “seamless,” everything about Bear is its definition. For someone like me, it, alone, almost warrants a reversion to MacOS. If you have the correct platforms, I *require* you to try it. Unfortunately, there can be no true Windows or Linux equivalent without the work Shiny Frog has done to streamline Bear’s near-instantaneous iCloud integration, but there is one application that can literally simulate its functionality in every other way. [Typora](https://typora.io/) is an infinitely-customizable alternative that spans all three platforms with a well-populated [themes gallery](https://theme.typora.io/) (including an [actual copy](https://theme.typora.io/theme/cobalt/) of my favorite Bear theme.) My installation is not nearly as *smooth* as Bear, but it’s technically more powerful – bad news for users like me who can’t resist fiddling. I’ve downloaded (and attempted to author/modify) a billion themes for Typora. Bear, by contrast, allows *just* enough stylistic modification (color theme, a choice list of 7 beautiful typefaces, and sliders for font size, line height, paragraph spacing,) without *any* access to its internal workings. In this way, it provides the perfect blend of customizability and minimalism. If you tend toward the latter, try an ultra-slim solution like WordPress’ [Simplenote](https://simplenote.com/).

![Telegram Desktop](https://i.snap.as/ERQF0xF.png)

## Telegram

I ran a poll on both [Twitter](https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/1252322233181261824) and [Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@DavidBlue/104032632147081656) yesterday asking “do you still email things to yourself?” Overwhelmingly, my “audience” responded “yes,” which is awfully surprising considering their demographic – young, techish early adopters. Though email is not yet “[obsolete](https://www.inc.com/john-brandon/why-email-will-be-obsolete-by-2020.html)” – as envisioned by *Inc*’s John Brandon in 2015 – it has indeed been replaced by other software in many of its functions, *especially* the old Mail-to-Self practice. I cannot remember the last time I emailed myself anything – even to transfer photos from my cellular to my computer, as I used to do often. Instead, I use a private [Telegram channel](https://telegram.org/faq_channels#q-what-39s-a-channel) to send myself photos, videos, links, text, and any other file up to 1.5GB! There’ve always been plenty of reasons to use the messaging app for general communication – especially since [Facebook acquired WhatsApp](https://techcrunch.com/2014/02/24/telegram-saw-8m-downloads-after-whatsapp-got-acquired/) in 2014. Though press coverage of the application has all but dried up, I would argue there are now [more reasons than ever](https://medium.com/@sirajea/11-reasons-why-you-should-use-telegram-instead-of-whatsapp-ab0f80fbfa79) to make use of Telegram in your day-to-day life.

[As of 2016](https://www.wired.co.uk/article/episode-256), Telegram had 100 million active users, but it’s certainly experienced its [fair share of controversies](https://www.abacusnews.com/digital-life/why-telegram-isnt-secure-you-think/article/3014398). I see no reason to be worried about encryption or privacy at all, for that matter, for the vast majority of Mail-to-Self cases. If the files you’re sending yourself are sensitive enough to worry about, you shouldn’t be emailing them, anyway.

## Other Stuff 

If you’re the sort of person who regularly types out 500+ word text messages (or have to do homework/any real writing) on your smartphone, I have a secret to reveal to you: **most smartphones still have Bluetooth keyboard support**. It may [look strange](https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/1144268334353047552), but yes, you can use a full qwerty keyboard with your phone. Those of us who’ve livestreamed or used screenrecording software know that [OBS](https://obsproject.com/) (Open Broadcaster Software) is an absolute gift from Gourd, but [these days](https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/31/21201043/streamlabs-obs-mac-streaming-twitch-mixer-facebook-youtube), it’s also easy enough for most computer users to make use of. I’d encourage everybody who can think of a reason to record their screen – to show somebody how to do something, for instance – to download and install it. Finally, I think every Windows user should look into [compacting their operating system](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/manufacture/desktop/compact-os) into just the essentials. “Compact OS” is really just a Windows 10 install without [bloatware](https://www.computerworld.com/article/2966113/bloatware-what-it-is-and-how-to-get-rid-of-it.html): the shit you almost certainly don’t need. If you *do* find yourself in need of default Microsoft apps, you’ll be able to redownload them instantly from the Windows Store.

I’d been meaning to write something like this for a very long time, so I hope you or someone you know has found it useful. I’m not an authority in the technical sense, but I’ve used every one of these suggestions in my own computing life for years, now, to great benefit. If you have any comments/suggestions/feedback/petty insults, please do contact me via [email](mailto:davidblue@extratone.com), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/NeoYokel), [Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@DavidBlue), or [Discord](http://bit.ly/extratone).

# You Know I'm Blogging

## When I have to pee too much to actually finish anything.

![Anxiety Theme by Max Henderson adapted for The Psalms](https://i.snap.as/giwgxmF.png)

I've updated the look of this blog with a theme adapted from "[Anxiety](https://write.as/themes/anxiety)" by Max Henderson but I've yet to update the [colophon](http://bilge.world/colophon) with the new colors (partially because I don't have the energy to name them yet.) [*Extratone*'s theme](https://write.as/themes/extratone) was listed on [write.as' new themes project](https://write.as/themes) a while ago, of which I am quite proud. I've begun [crossposting](https://crossposter.masto.donte.com.br/) to [Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@DavidBlue) from [Twitter](https://twitter.com/NeoYokel) again.

## Autos And Such

I'm mostly blogging because I am fairly stuck on the [Volkwagen Atlas review](https://bit.ly/2XJvcsQ) I promised to get done this week. (That link is to an online Word doc of my live progress, on which I'd love any comments on if you have them.) I've been playing enough [Gran Turismo Sport](https://dieselgoth.com/tag:GTsport) that I've created a new blog specifically for automotive writing at [**dieselgoth.com**](https://dieselgoth.com). There, on Titanic day, I made [a post](https://dieselgoth.com/review-progress-updates-and-social-links) including an ["exclusive" invite link to mastd.racing](https://mastd.racing/invite/vc8GBJqX), which I would compel any enthusiasts among you to oblige.

## Listening

<iframe style="border: 0; width: 100%; height: 120px;" src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=1158757778/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=e99708/tracklist=false/artwork=small/track=860711920/transparent=true/" seamless><a href="http://ceasedesist1.bandcamp.com/album/join-the-future-uk-bleep-bass-1988-91">Join The Future - UK Bleep &amp; Bass 1988-91 by Various Artists</a></iframe>

[This feature](https://daily.bandcamp.com/features/uk-bleep-and-bass-feature) on the *Bandcamp Daily* regarding "Bleep" has really been my shit. Imagine my 70-year-old mother dancing to [this](https://ceasedesist1.bandcamp.com/track/nightmares-on-wax-21st-kong).

> [Matt] Anniss subsequently went on a local Bristol internet station, penned a blog post, and posted [a DJ set of Bleep](https://www.mixcloud.com/sellbydave/bass-ment-jacks-bleep-history-mix-for-hivemindfm/), as a way to convince those same DJs that his thesis had some merit. He  wrote an in-depth feature on the form for electronic music site [Resident Advisor](https://www.residentadvisor.net/features/2349)—which caused him to think bigger about this formative, unsung moment in UK  dance music history. “I found the sound itself alien and otherworldly,  but also endlessly fascinating for some reason,” he says. “It seemed so  fresh and futuristic still, but also mysterious.”

## Software and Stuff

Still waiting on my tax return/possible Corona stipend, I have lost my subscription to Google One, meaning the business Extratone Gmail (ihadtopee@gmail.com) is about to be unhooked(?)/deleted/no longer able to receive mail. As such, I've spent the past few days moving accounts to davidblue@extratone.com including the newsletters I'm most fond of (like [Nextdraft](https://nextdraft.com/).) This has given me a good opportunity to weed out those I don't particularly care about *and* to try using Outlook as my primary email client once again. Somehow, this has got me reverted into trying to make use of my Microsoft Office business subscription once again - I have (eeek!) *not* been writing in Markdown. May the Gourd have mercy on my text format-fucking soul.

![Two Microsoft Apps on My Homescreen](https://i.snap.as/tpDJ4xL.png)

The *other* project I've been trying to distract myself from the Atlas review with is my list of poweruser/especially handy Windows/iOS/MacOS applications/tricks that I believe just about *everyone* should be using.

## Fucking Medium

In late March *Nieman Lab*'s [Laura Hazard Owen](https://twitter.com/laurahazardowen) published "[The long, complicated, and extremely frustrating history of Medium, 2012–present](https://www.niemanlab.org/2019/03/the-long-complicated-and-extremely-frustrating-history-of-medium-2012-present/#footnote_0_169692)," which includes the most complete, linear timeline of the website's existence anyone could ever ask for. Naturally - in classic medium fashion - she begins many of her sentences with "But," which [I really hate](https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/1250153204014288902).

> Why spend so much time worrying about what Medium is? Maybe because we  wanted to know whether it was a friend or an enemy. The answer is that  it’s neither. It’s a reflection of what the media industry has worried  about, and hoped for, and not received. But Medium was never something  that we would get to define. Instead, it’s turned out to be an endless  thought experiment into what publishing on the internet could look like. That’s not much fun for people who got burned along the way, but Medium was never exactly ours to begin with.

# Software Thanksgiving

![Digital Leaves](https://i.snap.as/SFHmuSlu.png)

## Purposing a disciplined effort to reflect on those tech products which have remained too fair and/or too good to catch the attention of the alarmists in us, recently.

I've never been a big fan of holidays, nor do I think Thanksgiving should be a federal one, given its shitty, undebatably imperialist origins, but these opinions are entirely inconsequential. Regardless of how I feel, Thanksgiving will remain as pervasive as ever in the spaces around me, so I thought I'd change things up this year and *actually participate* in a substantial way. I did my best to travel back to a vastly less complicated self, letting all of the crud that's accumulated atop my love of computers in the past twenty years: wokeness, adtech, Obama wearing VR glasses, etc... When I thought the Native Americans were *glad*  to see white people because they gave them guns and horses and assumed people made things because good ideas were the apex of currency. When I was able to respond to new software discoveries by screwing around aimlessly without wondering if they'd been stolen entirely from a handful of talented developers lacking in the resources and know how required to protect their ideas in the face of Microsoft's ruthless *Embrace, Extend, Extinguish* crusade. 

Forgive yourself for a moment and return there with me. Or perhaps somewhere else, if you need - wherever and whenever you last remember feeling genuinely enthralled with *The Future of Computers*. (Perhaps it was yesterday! If so, Gourd bless you. Never change.) Let's take ourselves back to kindergarten, before we knew anything about the rapid cyclical consolidation and monopolization within the technology industry that had already established itself as a trend, by then, when all we knew of the software we interacted with was contained within our most visceral reactions: *I like Ask Jeeves because I like red and I like Jeeves.* I vaguely remember when Google (the search engine) first broached the general awareness of my elementary school's computer lab. I'm fairly sure I even remember the sort of feelings that were elicited the first time I actually set eyes on the Google.com homepage: it looked so modern, then, compared to the rest of the web. (After two decades, it currently looks like shit.) Upon the first first query, it was immediately clear that Google was superior to any of the other search engines we'd been using.

This sort of encounter - with a service that significantly alters one's perception of a given set of tasks - is precious in our lives as users.

A few examples from my own using life which come to mind: 

- The first time I witnessed a Skype call.
- Downloading and using the beta Evernote client on the school machines in Junior High. 
- The first album I uploaded on Bandcamp. 
- Discord's first public release.
- The "moment" I first put a name to Markdown. (I'd been using bits of the syntax for years before I actually read the word.)
- And most recently, exploring Notion as personal catch-all documentation software. 

The atmosphere of elation about the future on which I so often lament has been replaced by wariness for most of us - from Californian software developers to tractor-hacking farmers. Now, the conversation is saturated with CEO appearances before legal committees, corporate memo leaks, and somber interviews. Of course, I have unquestionably contributed *more* than my share. In fact, I wish I could be twice as critical in twice the written volume, and [I believe](https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/1329078973691695117) the tech media industry to be far too culturally-embedded within Silicon Valley to be nearly critical enough. For this holiday, though, I think a respite from the negative is worthwhile and essential. I know it is for *my* personal sanity, at least.

A week ago, I shared [this Google Form](https://bit.ly/softthank) and asked you to reflect with me on the "really great" software/services *you* have encountered in your using life built by "technology companies who's business ethics align toward the benefit of us users and who's products are well-priced (or free!)" As of the time of this writing, nearly 80 responses have been recorded on the form, itself, and several more via [comments on *Hacker News*](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25177582). I deeply appreciate your participation! They're far from predictable, too - I've ended up learning a lot. The very first submission was for [Logos Bible Software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logos_Bible_Software), which has [quite a fascinating history](https://blogs.bible.org/bible-software-history-101/). I feel like those less-secular of us go unexposed to theological software without participants such as the human who submitted this one (thank you, human!,) and end up missing out on an entire segment of software development. Having studied The Good Book in a very much analog fashion through Lutheran school, I wonder in retrospect how software solutions could've changed the experience.

I have never received this volume of feedback in my prompts before, nor have I ever really seen a reason to close any of them to responses, so I'm going to take a blind shot at the dartboard and plan to close the form on **New Year's Day, 2021**. Until then, please feel free to respond in any way you'd like and/or view all the live answers in this [**very bad spreadsheet**](https://bit.ly/thanksheet) full of these very *good* responses. (My apologies - I have absolutely no idea how to use Google Sheets.)

## ⓣⓗⓐⓝⓚⓢ

I originally intended to go into relatively extensive detail for each of the entities on my own Most Thankful For list, but I do have to *actually stop somewhere*, so the commentary on these isn't remarkably insightful or educational. It *is* genuine, though, which is worth something, I hope.

### 1. [Bandcamp](https://bandcamp.com/)

Yes, I have tirelessly promoted [my essay about Bandcamp's holiness](https://bilge.world/bandcamp-streaming-music) for years now, but I have done so with good reason: here is a for-profit technology company which is building a one-of-a-kind product that invests directly in independent artists. I spent a whole summer scouring The Web looking for *a single misstep* or controversy and found absolutely none.

> Over the course of this super link-laden journey, we’d consider the alarmingly hypocritical possibility that it’s been overlooked by mainstream conversations only because it has so long operated in the precise manner we claim is so hopelessly absent from its neighbors in its deliberate, principled, and innovative journey towards a transparent, progressive vision.

### 2. [OBS](https://obsproject.com/)

Before OBS (Open Broadcaster Software,) streaming video was an absolute mess that usually involved paying for or pirating some proprietary software. Remember Ustream? Good God... 

<iframe width="auto" height="auto" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EPZXkvl8cT0?controls=0" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

OBS is the streaming video equivalent of Audacity and GIMP: an extremely powerful, infinitely-malleable set of tools that allow one to take full advantage of their hardware to capture and/or stream video and audio. 

![Typora - Gitbooks Slate Theme](https://i.snap.as/uWDyI56s.png)

### 3. [Typora](https://typora.io/)

There's a file entitled "[My Darling, Typora](https://github.com/extratone/bilge/blob/main/Drafts/My%20Darling%2C%20Typora.md)" sitting in my [essay drafts folder](https://github.com/extratone/bilge/tree/main/Drafts), currently, which describes this text editor as "the perfect writing software." (See its [notes page on Notion](https://www.notion.so/rotund/My-Darling-Typora-b20ac14f9d7e4b20b9c823b0d8292c8f) for more.) 

From another recommendation I wrote:

> Typora is an infinitely-customizable markdown editor spanning all platforms that's managed to become my primary word processor (and I'm someone who demands *a lot* from word processors.) It's immensely powerful in all the important ways - my use over the past two years has stress tested it with both enormous (100,000+ words) and extremely complicated (100+ images and embeds) documents. It's able to export even these chunkos to any format you can imagine instantaneously and never crashes.

From a comment I made on [*The Information*'s notetaking software comparison](https://www.theinformation.com/articles/tech-execs-are-obsessing-over-note-taking-apps-we-tested-them-out):

> Typora is a Markdown editor with left sidebar file sorting, very much like Bear (several available themes can make it look actually identical, in fact,) but without its native iCloud-based file syncing. It is cross-platform, open-source, and definitely more powerful, though.

The Typora theming community has been especially on-point, as of late. In the screenshot embedded above, it's wearing the Slate variation of [H16nning's Gitbook theme](https://theme.typora.io/theme/Gitbook/), which is by far the most beautiful configuration I've yet to see the editor in.

### 4. [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/)

The GNU Image Manipulation Program - which just celebrated its [*25th* anniversary](https://www.gimp.org/news/2020/11/21/25-years-of-gimp/) last week - is one of the most powerful tools in its space and perhaps *the* number one exemplary example of open source software to cite when explaining the concept for the first time. I have used it my entire creative life for all manner of tasks and evangelized it plenty, but it wasn't until I [returned to college](https://www.davidblue.wtf/college-return/) this Fall and took advantage of Adobe's student discounts that I had an opportunity to thoroughly explore its proprietary nemesis, Photoshop. 

<iframe width="auto" height="auto" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CezNvZ-TQlY?controls=0" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

What I found was indeed a very powerful piece of software, albeit as arrogant as ever in its stubborn commitment to the original keyboard shortcuts set by default and other legacy artifacts, though not one I would compare to GIMP, necessarily. This shouldn't be breaking news: as far as I know, there are billions of posts comparing the two going back to [the beginning of the written word](https://www.wired.com/1998/03/a-thrifty-photoshop-built-for-the-web/). My personal conclusion: **I can accomplish much more, much faster with GIMP** in every single one of my own use cases. 

### 5. [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/)

I was browsing some FOSS-related article aggregation page a few weeks ago when a post caught my eye: "[Audacity exceeds 100 million downloads](https://blog.fosshub.com/audacity-exceeds-100-million-downloads/)." In reflection, I realized in that moment that perhaps no other single piece of software has been so thoroughly present in my "workflows" across all sorts of projects through the years, largely because of its God-sent [Truncate Silence feature](https://manual.audacityteam.org/man/truncate_silence.html), which I have used to remove silence from audio files for as long as I've been working within the medium, basically. Every podcast episode I have ever published has passed through Audacity for this reason and others, as have voiceovers, high school punk band demo tapes, personal voice notes, and more.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">the world would actually be perfect if audacity&#39;s truncate silence feature could be autotied to video timecodes.</p>&mdash; David Blue (@NeoYokel) <a href="https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/766786796898357248?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 19, 2016</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Until OBS came along, Audacity was where all recorded audio started for myself and my creative friends. It was Audacity that captured (and caused, technically) the [death of my friend's soundcard in audio form](https://clyp.it/ycvt1wij) during the recording process for [*Hamura*](https://ihadtopee.bandcamp.com/album/hamura), the first Drywall album, back in October of 2011.

<iframe width="100%" height="auto" src="https://clyp.it/ycvt1wij/widget" frameborder="0"></iframe>

Fucking around in Audacity through the years has led to some halfway creative results on my part, including ["SLOWED 'N' THROWED" Hilary Duff tracks](https://soundcloud.com/digivoid/hilary-duff-with-love-slowed-n-throwed) and [legacy Windows sounds remixes](https://soundcloud.com/chordoslut/windows-operatic). I still use it for every episode of [*End User*](https://anchor.fm/davidblue) and have recently created a macro for remastering [*Drycast*](https://anchor.fm/drycast) episodes. (A big feat for me and reflective of Audacity's ingenuity.) As far as I know, there are *zero* competitors, proprietary or not, which can replicate Audacity's particular usefulness as an audio utility.

![NeoCities Interactions](https://i.snap.as/10geW13j.png)

### 6. [NeoCities](https://neocities.org/)

Shortly after I discovered NeoCities last Spring, I signed up to be a [Supporter](https://neocities.org/supporter) for $5/month, not necessarily for the additional storage or bandwidth, but because the project immediately sounded like one I was personally obligated to uplift. Parimal Satyal's essay "[Rediscovering the Small Web](https://neustadt.fr/essays/the-small-web/)," along with the design of the website which delivered it, inspired me to make another attempt at building an HTML site by hand. So far, [davidblue.xyz](https://davidblue.xyz/) obviously borrows *heavily* from his CSS, but looking at the code itself was vastly more pleasant than one would expect. Recently, during the course of writing an [academic research essay](https://github.com/extratone/bigblue), I found myself listening to [interviews with its founder, Kyle Drake](https://www.softwaresessions.com/episodes/bringing-geocities-back-with-kyle-drake/) and reading [articles from its debut in 2013](https://www.wired.com/2013/07/neocities/), which prompted me to take even further advantage of my account.

![The Drywall Website](https://i.snap.as/UhS9a89b.png)

Last week, I moved my inactive automotive blog ([dieselgoth.com](https://dieselgoth.com)) from a Writeas blog to a purely-HTML [NeoCities website](https://neocities.org/site/dieselgoth) with disturbingly little friction. (I challenge you to spot any differences.) After discovering a backup of the original Drywall Website deep within my old files, NeoCities was the only reasonable host on which to [archive it](https://iowa.neocities.org/). After I'd finished uploading, I fell down what the youth call a "rabbit hole" of discovery, mesmerized by what I found on page after page of [NeoCities' site browser](https://neocities.org/browse). I did my best to save the best finds by [following them](https://neocities.org/site/davidblue/follows) within the sites dashboard and have since set up a [*Best of NeoCities* GitHub repository](https://github.com/extratone/neocollect) with my absolute favorites among them archived thanks to [wget](https://www.gnu.org/software/wget/). 

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">LOOK AT THIS GORGEOUS WEBSITE! <a href="https://t.co/nahoRCEkeE">https://t.co/nahoRCEkeE</a> <a href="https://t.co/mzEfhGygWz">pic.twitter.com/mzEfhGygWz</a></p>&mdash; David Blue (@NeoYokel) <a href="https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/1328337497416458247?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 16, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Trust me when I tell you that **some of the best web design, *ever* can be found on NeoCities**. What's even better: after my deep dive, I was pleasantly surprised by strangers [commenting on what I'd found](https://neocities.org/site/davidblue?event_id=1301289)! Replying in a timely, substantial, and genuine manner seems to be a hallmark of the community: my (rather verbose) question regarding the well-manneredness of publishing such an archive without permission in [the community Discord](https://discord.gg/pF7wHrf9tb) I discovered just this morning was almost immediately met with encouraging replies.

A Post you should probably expect soon: "NeoCities is 2020's Best Social Network." Going forward, I'd like to [digitize my poetry collection on NeoCities](https://neocities.org/site/feebles) in the near future while continuing to otherwise brush back up on HTML and CSS - both of which I am *also* very thankful for, come to think of it.

Thank you again for your correspondence! May your Imperialism Day be a positive experience!

# The Social Dilemma's Dilemma

![The Social Dilemma - The Founders on Their iPhones](https://i.snap.as/5X1uFAi.jpg)

## The pop culture discussion of tech's greater issues missed in (at least) two major ways.

For those of us who've written about technology, generally, for quite a long time, any injection of the broader metaphysical/"ethical" conversation regarding the impact the industry has had/is having/is expected to have on our species into popular culture is inevitably an emotional event. *The Social Network* had an almost comical disregard for any potential function as a substantial critique of its subjects. Not that it's particularly supportive of that argument, but Mark Fuck, himself, recently [said in court](https://www.businessinsider.com/mark-zuckerberg-mentions-the-social-network-during-testimony-2018-4), essentially, that he didn't know what the movie was about. I'm not particularly sure, either. I suppose the dramatic film industry has no particular obligation to be critical of *the times*, but *documentaries* certainly should, in my estimation, and *The Social Dilemma* could've done better, in that regard.

First, the **actively misleading**: As thoroughly as I enjoyed Peter Campbell's casting as the master-manipulating triplets behind the dramatized young man's screen, the film's depiction of this very human invasion of privacy is *blatantly false* imagery. The Privacy Problem is *not* that Facebook or Google employees are directly and actively viewing and manipulating your use of their services in real time. In fact, it is *ridiculously* unlikely that human eyes will ever see your individualized information. One could go so far as to describe the whole film as "ridiculous," as did one of my favs, [Casey Newton](https://www.theverge.com/interface/2020/9/16/21437942/social-dilemma-netflix-review-orlowski-sarah-zhang-memo-facebook-buzzfeed):

> The dramatized segments include a fictional trio of sociopaths working inside an unnamed social network to design bespoke push notifications to distract their users. They show an anguished family struggling to get the children to put their phones away during dinner. And the ominous piano score that pervades every scene, rather than ratcheting up the tension, gives it all the feeling of camp.

[*The Verge*'s official review of the film](https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/4/21419993/the-social-dilemma-jeff-orlowski-netflix-movie-review-social-media-algorithms) - written by Adi Robinson and as cited by Casey - is an important read, as well. Robinson makes use of some very intelligent language and cites some very interesting bits (including a Wikipedia article about a series of Hogarth paintings?) for *The Verge*'s audience, who already knew all of this. What I hoped to do by writing about this at all was speak to those distinctly *separate* tech media - grandmothers, retirees, etc. - who are both directly affected by the subjects covered by *The Social Dilemma* and particularly susceptible to its delusions about "privacy" - a term which I would argue is not particularly relevant to the conversation. Personally, I define my privacy in a way that is not violated by the simple **collection** of "my data," regardless of how detailed said collection may or may not be, but would be by individual **examination** with human eyes, which - while possible - is extremely unlikely if for no other reason than a lack of business incentive. While Google may have access to the data it would need to determine whether I am currently showering or not, there is absolutely zero monetary gain to be had in one of its employees (or outsourced contractors) knowing this. 

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">you don&#39;t have to care about reforming privacy, intellectual property, or any of the other issues an alternative addresses - you need only to want a better and/or different experience.</p>&mdash; David Blue (@NeoYokel) <a href="https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/1283173322822488064?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 14, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Now, on to the **notably missing**: Perhaps most important to note before I go on is that the film was produced by - and directly promotes on several occasions - one particular organization, called the [*Center for Humane Technology*](https://www.humanetech.com/), which notably has a .com rather than a .org domain... hm. Immediately after watching the film, I complied with its direction to its website, where I was specifically looking for "solutions" to the issues it presented. Aside from Wikipedia (sortof,) it neglected to mention the abundance of alternative organizations and projects who've been building against the adtech-funded web for ages - some for decades. Unfortunately, neither the organization's website nor the film's webpage list any of these alternatives, whatsoever, which personally leads me to believe **the whole thing is bullshit**, for lack of a better term.

![The Social Dilemma Newsletter Prompt](https://i.snap.as/6k9MzeE.png)

The film essentially argues for a single choice: using social media and other adtech-sustained services, or *not* using them. What I'm here to tell you: **you have a choice of services**. For every single individual service criticized in the film, I guarantee there exists at least a handful of alternatives across a spectrum of sin. If you've followed my work for any length of time (you probably shouldn't still be reading,) you know I've advocated exhaustively for [Mastodon](https://joinmastodon.org/) - the open web, decentralized social network outpacing Twitter in every single way. Two years ago, I spent [an entire summer](https://bilge.world/bandcamp-streaming-music) arguing that Bandcamp is the only music streaming service who's business model benefits both platform and artist. I'm still finishing up [a massive essay that discusses alternatives to Facebook](https://www.notion.so/rotund/David-Blue-vs-Big-Blue-9d82a679c93a41d78c6736e8a61e30e0), which has been an exhausting but educational journey, as you can probably imagine, namely that leaving a platform as all-consuming as Facebook for an open-source and/or federated alternative requires a certain amount of bravery. Essentially, the evidence suggests that the *alternatives* discussion is a particularly important one to me, as is finding a way to evangelize it that isn't immediately off-putting to "the average person."

<iframe width="100%" height="265" src="https://clyp.it/oxpup2vm/widget" frameborder="0"></iframe>

Poke around the film's official website a bit and you'll discover a variety of heavily-branded "resources" for "taking action," all awash with a certain irony, including [a fucking Bingo game](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1juAZCcmRpNNjXajXnm0KOS-9fFUhPI3q/view) (hosted on Google Drive, no less,) which the site *actually* suggests you post on your Instagram story! Also under the "Take Action" vertical are links to Moment CEO Tim Kendall's [tips for reducing your screen time](https://www.thesocialdilemma.com/reclaim-your-screen-time/), the "[Data Detox Kit](https://datadetoxkit.org/en/home/)," which advocates for Firefox as the private browsing solution (among an indigestibly huge link tree,) a "Join Now" button, and - most ironic of all - a link to download the "[Ad Observer plugin](https://adobserver.org/)," in order to "share with researchers the ads you see on social media as they work to expose micro-targeting techniques & hold political advertisers accountable." In other words, the very same data collection the film condemns, albeit for the "Online Political Transparency Project" instead of the greater adtech monstrosity. 

![The Social Dilemma Bingo](https://i.snap.as/gf22b9R.png)

No, it's not a scam. Using *The Markup*'s shiny new [Blacklight tool](https://themarkup.org/blacklight), I found thesocialdilemma.com to be entirely free of any malicious tracking aside from the inevitable accompaniment to their Google Drive embeds. (Here's [the report in full](https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/893e4684-462b-4548-92ad-b85f240d0e85/report.html?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=AKIAT73L2G45O3KS52Y5%2F20201001%2Fus-west-2%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20201001T204417Z&X-Amz-Expires=86400&X-Amz-Signature=98001ad78557d11b12dda1347cb193c252f54a81b00547970717080c06bf04eb&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&response-content-disposition=filename%20%3D%22report.html%22).) All at once, we can be virtually certain there is no *malice* in this particular destination, at least, which leaves... incompetence? I'm afraid so. It is not revolutionary to suppose that the people who conceived of these ruthlessly effective systems of adtech and figure out how to implement them in the real world - regardless of what they believe now, or then - that these folks should not be our first call when we're searching for "solutions." You know this, they know it, and they *explicitly acknowledged it* at least twice in the film, itself, and yet the fact of it remains.

Would you care to guess what [Chapter 1](https://datadetoxkit.org/en/privacy/essentials/#step-1) of the [*Digital Detox Kit*](https://datadetoxkit.org/) is about? I can't imagine you'd be correct... Under the heading "CONTROL YOUR SMARTPHONE DATA," step 1 is literally just *renaming your phone*:

> At some point, you may have “named” your phone for *Wi-Fi, Bluetooth* or both – or maybe the name was automatically generated during setup.
>
> This means that *“Alex Chung’s Phone”* is what’s visible to the Wi-Fi network owner and, if your Bluetooth is turned on, to everyone in the area who has their Bluetooth on as well.
>
> You wouldn't announce your name as you enter a café, restaurant, or airport, so neither should your phone.

Now, I've always considered the ability to change a computer's name an immense privilege. My first "real" computer's name was Clementine, then there was Bertha, two Sophies (probably my favorite traditionally female name, so I excuse myself,) Silas, Linus, Uel, Jehoshaphat, Temba, Knot, and now Hildur. My iPhone 8 Plus' name is Gravel. However, I realize that most users could care less, and I think that's completely rational. Technically, suggesting you change your phone's common name to that of "your favorite television character" ([Hildur Odegard](https://fortitude.fandom.com/wiki/Hildur_Odegard) is my favorite character in *Fortitude*, so...) is *not* bad advice, even within its own privacy-centered argument, it's just that it's *ridiculously* low priority (or should be) compared with doing just about anything else along this vein. A conundrum is presented: I cannot imagine these people sitting down and seriously jotting down "change device name" as step 1 in their strategy, but I also cannot fathom an incentive for them to expend such effort facetiously or maliciously. Again, incompetence/ignorance is the only remaining explanation.

I have to backtrack, now, and confess that I *did* find an "[Alternative Apps Centre](https://datadetoxkit.org/en/alternative-app-centre/)" within the Data Detox Kit, which contains some genuinely smart recommendations like ProtonMail, Riot, Signal, and DuckDuckGo surrounding a bunch of privacy-enhancing browser extensions. However, the "detox" seems to have been lost at some point along the way. No amount of privacy (yes, I do think it's hilarious that I can freely refer to "privacy" as a commodity with a positive quantity) can detoxify one' social media addiction. The savvy reader notes the "Supported by Mozilla Firefox" badges all over the website and asks me "well, what did you expect?" My answer: something "more" than promotion, I suppose.

I suspect this is another case of *don't go to those who created the problem for the solution*. *More privacy* is a more tangible vector upon which to "innovate" than simply *putting down the fucking phone*, but the interviewees in the film at least touched upon a very important insight in that regard: **turn off all your notifications**. I genuinely believe turning off *all* notifications is a good way to proceed, especially if this film (or anything else, for that matter) has made you feel uncomfortable about your relationship with your phone. I realized that I'd somehow allowed YouTube to clutter my notifications unconsciously for *years*, which is disturbing. In general, the apps who's notifications I'd probably value the most (Bandcamp!) are the ones who use the feature the least/the most subtly.

Leaving your phone in a different room while you sleep is a good idea, though it seems a bit excessive when you could just **turn it off**, instead. (Displaced from your bed or stone dead, your chances of making use of your handset in an emergency are about the same, I'd wager.) I suspect it's long overdue for a reboot, anyway. As far as "**Email Addiction**" goes, I suggest you first take an afternoon to go through your inbox and make use of GDPR's greatest gift: the single-click opt-out, most often found in very small text in a given email's footer. If you're *really* serious, unsubscribe from even the newsletters you *do* read and make yourself resubscribe to them. Make use of your preferred email platform's archives feature - or don't - but clear everything from your inbox itself. Mark it all as read. Then, you'll be ready to seek out other *Email Wellness* methodologies like the recently-trendy *Inbox Zero*.

If quitting social media cold turkey is not viable in your personal or professional life, **a set daily time** to check your notifications is a very good start. Yes, it's okay to announce on Facebook that you're taking a break from Facebook. There *is* a very good reason: accountability, to both yourself and your friends. If you are interested in the alternatives I mentioned before, genuinely **contact me literally any time**. My personal phone number is **(573) 823-4380**. I would be elated to discuss some of the services I've discovered with you. 

My own advice on "privacy:" don't worry about installing browser extensions, or using a different browser for that matter. Aside from a password manager, there is no need to download or install any additional software to protect your information. All the "privacy tools" you need are already present on your device, and they mostly consist of geolocation settings. If you're an iOS user, you've already been confronted with them in the past few months. If you are still genuinely bothered by automated data collection unseen by human eyes, your only next step - if we're really honest with ourselves - is figuring out how you're going to go without the internet. Untracked browsing is no longer a realistic option.

# Indulging Once More in Digital Excess

![So Much To Do, So Much To See](https://i.snap.as/f1fGg1B.png)

## An update on all I’ve been doing instead of what I actually intended to do.

> There will always be plenth of things to compute in the detailed affairs of millions of people doing complicated things. - Vannevar Bush, "[As We May Think](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1945/07/as-we-may-think/303881/)"

> Everything happens so much. - [Horse_ebooks](https://twitter.com/horse_ebooks/status/218439593240956928)

*You have a desire for indulgence in your home and family*, [Co-Star](https://www.costarastrology.com/neoyokel) has just told me in my weekly, email newsletter-delivered horoscope. “Venus conjunct to natal Moon” indicates *this part of yourself will transform into something else*, and goes on to say something truly stirring: ***the way you relate to your past is changing\***. I continue to be amazed by how influential the potential of the computing hardware present in my life at any given time can be on my habits. In the two weeks I’ve had [my first moderately powerful desktop computer](https://www.davidblue.wtf/hp-envy-desktop/) in over ten years, I have found myself using new image & video editing software, installing local WordPress stacks, finally experimenting with Git, somehow generating 20 draft posts on [a fresh experimental WordPress site](https://www.davidblue.wtf/), and putting my whole back into my new Notion account, including – among others – projects like my “[Keyboard Shortcuts Wiki](https://www.notion.so/rotund/Keyboard-Shortcuts-Wiki-9b4567d5b41447638cd6330aed7c2a1b).” All the while, there has been a pull toward a more deliberate, focused sort of digital existence: reflection on [Kevin McGillivray’s Word of The Year concept](https://www.kevinmcgillivray.net/word/), [digital gardening](https://tomcritchlow.com/blogchains/digital-gardens/), and a few other like discoveries have culminated in a newfound, unironic use of the term “[Creative Wellness](https://www.notion.so/rotund/Creative-Wellness-b43e3df6f4b94333aa97ea98b67cb760)” to describe a set of ideologies which I believe I should strive for in order to improve my intellectual wellbeing. 

In tandem with the fact that I have [gone back to school](https://www.davidblue.wtf/college-return/), this has all crucially resulted in very little *actual writing*, which may or may not be conclusive evidence toward the classical minimalist technology argument that less capability results in more focus. On that note, remember when [the *Game of Thrones* author appeared on Conan’s show](https://www.theverge.com/2014/5/14/5716232/george-r-r-martin-uses-dos-wordstar-to-write) and mentioned that he still writes exclusively using WordStar 4.0? This happening has been vaguely in the back of my mind since I encountered it during the relatively brief, basement apartment-dwelling era in Oregon when I first discovered WinWorldPC and got into running a bunch of DOS VMs, trying out every download from that blessed site which sounded even remotely interesting. Before I go on, let me just include a transcript of the entire anecdote I’m referring to here, because it’s actually much shorter than one is led to believe:

> **Conan**: These novels that that you write are can be over a thousand pages long. They're massive tomes and apparently you write them all on a computer, but unlike most authors, you're not worried about a computer virus. I mean an author who writes a thousand-page book their greatest fear is a virus invades and destroys a chunk of their book you don't worry about that. Why?
>
> **Martin**: No I have a secret weapon - I actually have two computers: I have the computer that I browse the internet with and that I get my email on and I do my taxes on and that computer and then I have my writing computer which is a DOS machine not connected to the Internet.
>
> **Conan**: A DOS machine. How old is this program?
>
> **Martin**: A DOS machine. You remember DOS? I use WordStar 4.0 as my word processing system. 
>
> **Conan**: Did you make this computer out of wood? Did you carve it? I'm curious why you decided to stick with this old program.

> **Martin**: I actually like it. I mean, it does everything I want a word processing program to do, and it doesn't do anything else. I don't want any help. I hate some of these modern systems where you type a lowercase letter and it becomes a capital. I don't want a capital - if I wanted a capital, I would've typed a capital. I know how to work the shift key. Stop fixing it!

> **Conan**: You yell at computers a lot. What about spellcheck?
>
> **Martin**: Oh, I hate spellcheck. Especially when you have the realm of [???], it's [???].

That’s it! A less than sixty second exchange. I did not remember just how much coverage it received on digital news sites. Embark on a Google search for “[george rr martin wordstar](https://www.google.com/search?q=george+rr+martin+wordstar),” and you’ll discover a ridiculously long list of brief stories including the YouTube embed. A book I’ve just recently discovered and begun – which I am extremely excited about – is Professor Matthew G. Kirschenbaum’s [*Track Changes: A Literary History of Word Processing*](https://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674417076), and its introduction begins by mentioning *The George Thing*, which surely indicates that it is the most significant mention of word processing software in popular culture for at least a decade:

> The clip was posted to YouTube and from there embedded in innumerable tweets, Facebook feeds, and blogs. Some commenters immediately, if indulgently, branded Martin a Luddite, while others opined it was no wonder it was taking him so long to finish the whole story (or less charitably, no wonder that it all seemed so interminable). But what was it about these seemingly obscure details that people found so compelling? Part of it was no doubt the unexpected blend of novelty and nostalgia: Many fans would be old enough to remember WordStar for themselves, and the intricacy of its interface seems somehow in keeping with Martin’s quirky persona, part paternalistic grandfather and part *Doctor Who* character. WordStar thus becomes an accessory to his public image, like the black fisherman’s cap he is frequently photographed wearing. But it is also clearly much more than that. Martin’s passion for the program is unmistakable...

The book, itself, was also more widely reviewed than one would expect, where it was deemed genuinely unique. I *related* quite hard to the preface’s first few sentences:

> *Track Changes* began, as many books do, with a question: What was the first novel written with a word processor? Being an English professor interested in the history of writing as well as computers, I thought it was the sort of thing I should know, but I didn’t.

Discovering the volume was a result of a personal determination in the last week to give in to my latent obsession with word processing/text editing software, which also led to my creating [a Notion table of every word processor I’ve ever heard of](https://www.notion.so/rotund/0f3f754d5a4b46cb99bd3e1c0a2e1159?v=a85e98bc06424b72a3a249a87cb62101). Thanks to my desktop PC acquisition, found myself virtual machining a bit again, though some of the programs I’m particularly interested in trying have inexplicitly disappeared from my personal library and been removed from WinWorldPC, probably due to (mostly absurd) copyright claims. Most versions of WordStar are [still available](https://winworldpc.com/product/wordstar), though, and I’ll confess I still have a desire to learn how to use its cult keyboard shortcuts, [as evangelized by Robert J. Sawyer in an essay](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2017/03/wordstar-a-writers-word-processor/) *also* discussed in *Track Changes*, which specifically shits on WordPerfect more explicitly than I remembered. I keep returning to the idea that I should try writing the stuff I normally work on – like this post, for instance – in these software, but file transfer is a bigger and bigger obstacle the older the OS you’re running: VirutalBox’s “[Guest Additions](https://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch04.html)” – which allow clipboard sharing/shared folders/other interoperative network functions – are not compatible with DOS or any Windows editions before 4.0. There are workarounds, but I haven’t found any reasonably within my current abilities.

Truthfully, though, emulating twenty-year-old software seems a bit unnecessary when contrasted with the fact that Markdown, Typora, and Writeas were [supposed to be my saviors](https://write.as/community/chat-with-david-blue) from distracted writing. A compulsion to comment on a [recent note-taking app comparison published in *The Information*](https://www.theinformation.com/articles/tech-execs-are-obsessing-over-note-taking-apps-we-tested-them-out) reminded me that I *still* haven’t written an in-depth review of Typora, which I plan to prioritize in the near future, especially since it may finally be officially releasing, according to [recent activity on Twitter](https://twitter.com/Typora/status/1289586532353900544). 

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">some gorgeous themes added to Typora&#39;s theme gallery recently. <a href="https://t.co/oFXop0W9ZU">https://t.co/oFXop0W9ZU</a> <a href="https://t.co/mZ3OwAqrv6">pic.twitter.com/mZ3OwAqrv6</a></p>&mdash; David Blue (@NeoYokel) <a href="https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/1307551063810158594?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 20, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Another result of my reintroduction to academia is that I can now afford a subscription to Adobe Creative Cloud thanks to student discounts. This has been life-changing in a manner which I should probably be a bit ashamed of, but once the desire to *make full use* of my subscription (by trying every single program it licenses) subsides, I really do intend to become proficient with [InDesign](https://www.davidblue.wtf/t/Adobe-Indesign/) – a learning experience which I will surely at least attempt to thoroughly document, here. 

## Digital Gardening

I think it was [Tom Critchlow’s Digital Gardening blogchain](https://tomcritchlow.com/blogchains/digital-gardens/) that first exposed me to the term and [his static site-generated wiki project](https://tomcritchlow.com/wiki/) that introduced me to the concept of personal wikis, not so long ago, though the desire to organize and/or archive personally-relevant information through the format has actually been rattling around my head for the better part of a decade. When I discovered that one could install [MediaWiki](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/MediaWiki) – the platform Wikipedia, itself is built on – I created the shortlived *Drywall Wiki*, once upon a time. Since I last wrote you, I also purchased the [extratone.wiki](https://extratone.wiki/) domain and played around once again with the platform. Typora even offers exports in MediaWiki’s bizarre proprietary text format! For better or worse, though, I don’t see anything becoming of the project for the moment I suppose it feels like somewhat of a risk, investing a lot of time I probably shouldn’t have into documenting all of my Twitter jokes. For the moment, I think my Notion account will have to serve as my personal wiki.

The most inciteful argument I’ve read among the Digital Gardens discourse revolves around *value* as it is created within our personal online writing spaces. Two of the many infinitely-quotable essays within this space: Mike Caulfield’s “[The Garden and the Stream: A Technopastoral](https://hapgood.us/2015/10/17/the-garden-and-the-stream-a-technopastoral/)” and “[Stock and flow](http://snarkmarket.com/2010/4890)” from *Snarkmarket*. The former references Vannevar Bush’s infamous “[As We May Think](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1945/07/as-we-may-think/303881/)” essay (which I’ve finally gotten around to finishing and its description of a “memex,” which many cite as a disturbingly-apt prediction of the World Wide Web. Caulfield, however, disagrees:

> So most people say this is the original vision of the web. And certainly it was the inspiration of those pioneers of hypertext. But in reality it doesn’t predict the web at all . Not at all. The web works very little like this. It’s weird, because in our minds the web still works like this, but it’s a fiction.

Reading back from a lens including this commentary, I immediately understood. The *memex* concept is far more intimate than the web has become (or perhaps ever was – I wouldn’t know.) “Stock and flow” defines creative value in two disparate types of media:

> **Flow** is the feed. It’s the posts and the tweets. It’s the stream of daily and sub-daily updates that reminds people you exist.
>
> **Stock** is the durable stuff. It’s the content you produce that’s as interesting in two months (or two years) as it is today. It’s what people discover via search. It’s what spreads slowly but surely, building fans over time.

To be honest, I personally cannot imagine undertaking the task of explaining this differentiation to *anyone* in my own life, but if the reactionary movement within The Web back to a focus on *valuable* content is, indeed, underway, perhaps such conversations are bound to shortly become more and more natural. For my part, I have attempted setting up an experimental site on Github Pages using Jekyll in the past few days with partial success: as soon as I tried to specify a custom theme, I apparently broke it, at which point I realized that I had homework to do. As much as I hate to admit it, [Kev Quirk’s posts regarding WordPress’ *practical* simplicity over SSGs](https://kevq.uk/static-site-generators-revisited/) earlier this monthrings somewhat true. As things currently stand, WordPress’ permeability throughout The Web is an *advantage* for those who just want to publish something as simply as possible. My counterargument to both Kev and myself: **[Writeas](https://write.as/) is a wonderful compromise** in terms of substance and *image* among one’s super e-enabled, Mullenweg-disgusted peers. It’s very much pure Markdown, but it’s far more accessible, cross-platform, than SSGs due to its shear simplicity.

One component which Digital Gardening would seem to offer others that I have never particularly struggled with is the freedom to write whatever I feel like writing. If anything, I have struggled in the opposite sense, existing in a state *completely unhindered* by consideration of the value my work may or may not offer anyone else. Perhaps the most substantial addition I’m capable of making to the Digital Gardens conversation, then, is best quoted from the first chapter of the advice book I have finally begun writing for young men, *[For God’s Sake, Just Sit Down to Piss](https://www.davidblue.wtf/writing/projects/piss/)*:

> If there is one idea of mine you ever engage with – in this book or otherwise – it is best distilled in this single sentence: **you do not \*actually\* want to attain a state of true apathy**, trust me. It is extremely unhealthy, miserable, and alienating. I have existed for an excruciatingly long time trapped in a state of being truly unable to care about anything in the face of a great, varying effort to do so. It is very far from the immunity imbued in terms like *carefree* – in reality, it is manifested in extreme depression. It is less *immunity* than it is *distance* from an essential part of life.

In terms of one’s blogging, I am glad for those who will/have/are finding a new freedom of expression, but hold this as a serious caution regarding the *other* extreme. Should you ever approach it, remember that *considering one’s audience* – as academics love to prioritize – really *is* important, eventually. 

## Curation

At this point, I’ve used [a channel in *Extratone*’s Discord](https://bit.ly/extratone) as my ongoing reading list for several years essentially without change. Earlier this month, though, I discovered Raindrop – a bookmarking service with public collections that (so fars) feels much more aligned with my own needs than Pocket – and pretty much immediately signed up to begin paying for it and set up a bot to crosspost from [my new Reading List collection](https://raindrop.io/collection/13380406), there to the same Discord channel via [the collection’s RSS feed](https://raindrop.io/collection/13380406/feed). Raindrop’s browser extension – along with Notion’s, come to mention it – is *actually usable* in day-to-day browsing. As much as I love [Reading.am](https://www.reading.am/davidblue), the prospect of its longevity worries me considering the most recent post in its [development blog](https://writing.reading.am/) dates to 2016. Writing a dedicated “[Little Review](https://www.davidblue.wtf/c/software/little/)” of Raindrop is on my (ever-lengthening) todo list, but at the moment, I would especially emphasize my [Digital Magazine Collection](https://raindrop.io/collection/13419360), which is the result of thousands of hours of web exploration and genuinely worth significant value for most anyone, I think.

With the combination of my public Notion workspaces and public Raindrop collections, I hope to make my curatorial endeavors both more accessibly beautiful and more intimately available. In terms of a dedicated discussion of Notion’s interworkings and culture, I think I have quite a bit more exploring to experience before I’m sufficiently qualified, though my notes are already quite extensive (and [publicly accessible](https://www.notion.so/rotund/Little-Review-Notes-228e10a1d3fe453fac69c9244a24ee3a), thanks to… Notion!) In general, I continue to be astounded by the amount of tools/services/applications I *have not yet* heard of, despite how long I have labored to become an authority on Writing Tools.

![Too Many Fonts! - WordPerfect](https://i.snap.as/mPEMBma.png)

## Workflow

In my endeavor to more intentionally design my workspace – to actually dedicate a space for working, originally – I originally very much intended to set up dual displays for my desktop, but the desk I settled for (an old family piece from the early 1900s?) does *not* have enough surface area to position two displays, regardless of how thin they’ve become since I last had one. Combined with a limited budget and a concern that two displays might actually result in *further* distraction instead of less, I instead went for a single, 27” LED affair. I’ve also been making full use of [Windows 10’s desktop switching feature](https://www.cnet.com/how-to/how-to-use-multiple-desktops-in-windows-10/) and have found it surprisingly easy to make a habit, especially thanks to the **Ctrl+Win+Lateral Arrow Keys** keyboard shortcuts.

![Hildur Keyboard Shortcuts](https://i.snap.as/lEx7zen.png)

On the subject of keyboard shortcuts, I’ve by now worked out a personally-optimized remap (thanks to the keyboard manager tool included with [PowerToys](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerToys), about which I have *far too much* to say in some future post.) I had [a conversation with a few Mastodon friends](https://mastodon.social/web/statuses/104843391967830863) two weeks ago convincing me that my methodology of forcing myself to learn shortcuts by integrating a cheat sheet into my desktop backgrounds may actually be an *original idea* and useful to other users.

In terms of writing spaces, I have actually been composing the less serious stuff I’ve been writing within WordPress’ Gutenberg editor, which is *not* an admission I would’ve expected to be making, just a year ago. A dedicated post about this, too, is *fucking coming*, but suffice it to say that with a fairly-substantial PC and a better hosting provider (DreamHost over GoDaddy, in this case,) composition has become *far far* smoother – improving enough to make it a viable space within which to pound away original stuff for the first time. Writing essays for academia has encouraged my return to Microsoft Word, once again, on which I’ll blame the fact that I am currently composing this very bit in The Old Bitch. A desire to once again hack together a set of personalized Word templates has led to the birth of two such files which I am proud enough to [share on my Notion drive](https://www.notion.so/rotund/Configuration-2efccc31e19540c294b2bc5b7cfa4863). Eventually, I would also like to take the time to completely redesign the “Ribbon” in Word – something which I’ve literally never seen anyone else do. (I spent a substantial amount of time trying to find a library for MS Office customization files, to no avail, though you can find my own customization file as it stands on the same Notion page linked just now. Let me know if you’re able to successfully import it.)

![Woke Word](https://i.snap.as/gsVHo1z.png)

A confession of vanity: I suspect the only reason I haven’t yet stopped composing within WordPress is that I figured out how to change the typeface to Adobe Caslon (across both the editor and the front-facing site, naturally,) thanks to my newfound access to Adobe Typekit. Yes, apparently I really *am* that shallow. For those Office 365 users among you, I *highly* suggest you look up [how to enable the Classic Office sound theme](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/turn-off-annoying-sounds-microsoft-office-2016/). Unlike *Make Use Of*, I find them both adorable and genuinely useful as auditory feedback. You may also be interested in my discovery of [some fairly-Woke additions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/style-guide/bias-free-communication) to Word’s autocorrect options and the [subsequent bitchy controversy](https://www.foxnews.com/tech/microsoft-ai-word-politically-correct) their introduction spawned.

![Software History Society Banner](https://i.snap.as/YHk2EhE.png)

## The Read-It Website

If you know me at all, the following admission probably seems unbelievable: I have been *using Reddit*. I created a [new subreddit for *Extratone*](https://www.reddit.com/r/extratown/) – which I do not necessarily expect to be populated any time soon – and [r/SoftwareHistory](https://www.reddit.com/r/softwarehistory) after discovering that it didn’t yet exist, which I *definitely* do not expect you to populate, but would be delighted if you did. As with seemingly everything else I’ve covered, I *also* intend to write about how Reddit’s recent feature additions and redesign may *actually* make it a redeemable space on The Web, which should prove interesting. Clearly, I have become more than willing to accept the moniker of *Software Historian* whenever/if ever my authority achieves the appropriate volume to deserve to be christened so.

Obviously, none of the developments I’ve shared in this post indicate any improvement in my productive output, but I hope to learn soon how to settle into a fairly-consistent (and hopefully much more original) writing process.

# 'Greyhound''s Top-Side Pot Shot

![Greyhound Porthole](https://i.snap.as/HmoHf1B.jpg)

## Examining Fred Rogers' debut Atlantic-theatre naval anxiety compilation.

It's a little late to write about [*Greyhound*](https://letterboxd.com/film/greyhound/) - Tom Hanks' [first screenwriting credit](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000158/#writer) - which released [on Apple TV+](https://tv.apple.com/us/movie/greyhound/umc.cmc.o5z5ztufuu3uv8lx7m0jcega) this past Father's Day, June 21st. Though I definitely left my quite severe obsession with WWII history in my prepubescence, I thought I'd remark on this film because I originally hoped it would fulfill a role I'd long wanted for: the destroyer-side compliment to U-boat films like [*Das Boot*](https://letterboxd.com/film/das-boot/) and [*U-571*](https://letterboxd.com/film/u-571/). James D. Hornfischer's exceptional account of the [U.S.S. Samuel B. Roberts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Samuel_B._Roberts_(DE-413))' part in [The Battle off Samar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_off_Samar) with [*The Last Stand of the Tin Can Sailors*](http://www.randomhousebooks.com/books/82865) was my last dive into naval history. It's one of the most astounding war stories I've ever encountered, and upon first seeing [*Greyhound*'s trailer](https://youtu.be/eyzxu26-Wqk), I was sortof hoping it was the Big Boy film adaptation its always warranted. (Though apparently there was a [TV movie](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1068999/) made in 2005???) Instead, its based on (distinct from "adapted from," apparently) a 1955 novel by English author C.S. Forester entitled [*The Good Shepherd*](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/260852968364965888/737932123159265300/The_Good_Shepherd_-_C.S._Forester.pdf).

Tom Hanks made sure to imbue his first screenplay with a *shitload* of "[opaque naval jargon](https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/jul/06/greyhound-review-tom-hanks-second-world-war-film)," as *The Guardian*'s Peter Bradshaw's review put it. A brief ["investigation" by *The Cinemaholic*](https://www.thecinemaholic.com/greyhound-ship-world-war-ii/) suggests that the U.S.S. Keeling - the film's singular setting - most resembles a [*Mahan*-class destroyer](http://destroyerhistory.org/goldplater/mahanclass/), though none actually bore the name. For the actual photography, the production made use of a surviving example of the [most mass-produced destroyer](http://destroyerhistory.org/goldplater/mahanclass/) of all time:

> When it came to shooting the film, instead of relying completely on sets, the crew of ‘Greyhound’ found another option. They used USS Kidd, a real WWII destroyer, to film the journey of Greyhound. She is a Fletcher-class destroyer and is named after Rear Admiral Isaac C. Kidd, the first US flag officer to die during the Second World War.

As much as you're going to loathe it, I must include this commentary on *Greyhound*'s historical accuracy if only because - as a undoubtedly mainstream film - its been so widely and competently reviewed, already, by real film writers. I am almost positive U-boats would rarely - if ever - waste their precious few viable torpedo shots firing ultra-close-range at the agile, super-speedy destroyers and destroyer escorts that protected supply convoys, and I am *sure* that none ever bothered with *audibly addressing enemy ships* over the radio in English. I understand that dramatizing historic events is the core function of *Greyhound*'s genre, but this particular addition was so unbearably cheesy that it utterly decimates all of the experience's hard-won context. Just look at a snippet from the first of two dialogues in text:

> Greyhound. Greyhound, Greyhound.
>
> This is Gray Wolf.
>
> We hunt you and your friends
> Eagle, Dicky and Harry.
>
> We watch your ships sinking into the deep.
>
> We hear the screams of your comrades
> as they die.
>
> How many of them will there be
> before you join them?
>
> The Gray Wolf is so very hungry.

I'm sure there's an essential academic film function which only similar enemy taunts could perform and without which this screenplay would've been *technically* unsound, and - if I were allowed supposition - I would venture to guess that America's Favorite Dad felt pressured to bolster his first penning against easy gimmes for the Great Big institution of cinema criticism as much as possible. *However*, this shit is just disruptingly cheesy. Fuck it! Have the rest:

> Greyhound!
>
> Your flock is not safe from this wolf.
>
> We can always find you
> in the night to kill you.
>
> Or will Dicky die next? Or Harry?
>
> [Gray Wolf howls]
>
> ...
>
> Greyhound.
>
> Guten Morgen, Greyhound.
>
> Did you think you had slipped away
> from this Gray Wolf?
>
> No, you did not. You will not.
>
> The sea favors the Gray Wolf on the hunt,
> not the hound on the run.
>
> You and your comrades will die today.

The contrast with the rest of the script's imposingly thorough and relentlessly-paced naval action dialogue is far too abrupt to *not* be problematic. Even as obsessed as I was with naval history, I'm still too oblivious to the details of what is/was actually said on the bridge of a warship during combat maneuvers to tell you how authentic *Greyhound*'s depiction really is (it's hardly ever shown on the screen or laid out in nonfiction, even,) which nullifies all relevance the realism would've had, otherwise. Director Aaron Schneider in [an interview for *Vanity Fair*](https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2020/07/greyhound-movie-tom-hanks-aaron-schneider):

> “If you decide to read *Greyhound* by tracking the dialogue—rudder commands and sonar distances—you’ll soon find yourself completely lost. Because that’s not where the movie lives. This screenplay was designed to beam you aboard the USS *Keeling*…and it’s up to you to engage with what’s going on and extrapolate how things work, so you can answer the question, ‘What the hell is going on here?’"

In this sense - crafting a consuming, believable, unbelievably gray, claustrophobic, icing iron reality - Tom Hanks excels.

Though Letterboxd user [brucewayn](https://letterboxd.com/brucewayn/) called it "boring" in [the most popular review of the film](https://letterboxd.com/brucewayn/film/greyhound/) to date on the platform, I found *Greyhound* to be quite engaging in an anxious, depressing sense familiar to classic war dramas like *Saving Private Ryan* and *Black Hawk Down*. The tedium of naval warfare's endless orienteering is rescaled to a battlefield of lesser distances - axis and allied vessels actually collide on several occasions and a U-boat crew decides to *fuck it all* and brawl it out with two parallel destroyers with surface guns instead of retreating after losing their ability to dive. (See: [*Titanic VI*](https://youtu.be/4uOcE_IIi30).) Through a combination of wartime compression and stitching, *Greyhound* is in large part a mashup of naval action at the extremes of what historical fiction will allow within its 48-hour setting. From Ben Lindbergh's [review for *The Ringer*](https://www.theringer.com/movies/2020/7/9/21318481/tom-hanks-greyhound-review):

> In *The Good Shepherd*, enemy torpedoes simply sail wide; in the movie, they graze the hull for even closer calls. In the book, Krause agonizes over, and generally resists, calling the crew to general quarters, wary of exhausting their energy reserves; in the movie, he doesn’t hesitate to summon his sailors to battle stations.

The result is an emotionally effective film constrained by a very specific dramatic aim: another war movie every father can juice for decades' worth of Sunday afternoons on the sofa. "As befits his status as America's Dad, Hanks has constructed for us the ultimate Dad Movie — all the action you could ever need or want, with no annoying characters hanging around, harboring pesky needs and wants of their own," [quips Glen Weldon for *NPR*](https://www.npr.org/2020/07/10/888899608/world-war-ii-naval-drama-greyhound-charts-a-trim-efficient-course). Undoubtedly, though, the subject matter is fresh. I wouldn't say my youth desire for a surface-side Atlantic-theatre film is 100% satiated, but *Greyhound* managed to accomplish much more than I expected.

# Email and I: An Abridged History

![Hey Tile](https://i.snap.as/l7jhO5a.png)

## Basecamp's HEY matters, and not just because it took on Apple's App Store policies.

Something always worth celebrating: a considered, no-nonsense new effort to reimagine email. I've lived through many notable milestones in this regard: [Apple Mail](https://youtu.be/vN4U5FqrOdQ?t=2321) on the original iPhone, [Gmail](https://time.com/43263/gmail-10th-anniversary/), Readdle's [Spark](https://www.theverge.com/2015/5/29/8683775/spark-email-app-iphone-apple-watch), and (yes, really,) the revitalization of [Microsoft's Outlook](https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/4/17819636/microsoft-resdesigned-outlook-windows-web). Exciting innovations have abounded throughout email's history, but it's highly debatable whether or not any of them have really changed the way we use it in a profound way, yet I am unfailingly intrigued whenever somebody new comes along, so when I saw [Casey Newton's story](https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/15/21286466/hey-email-basecamp-price-availability-platforms-launch) on *The Verge*'s frontpage discussing Basecamp's [HEY](https://hey.com/) before I got out of bed on the morning of June 15th, I was delighted to see an organization still had the courage to invest their confidence and resources into their Ideas About Email. Originally, [HEY's homepage](http://web.archive.org/web/20200510220647/https://hey.com/) included a prompt: "To get on the list, email iwant@hey.com and tell us how you feel about email. Could be a love story, or a hate story. Could be long, could be short. It’s your story, so it’s up to you." Though I knew it'd likely never be read, I decided to write them a letter about my personal history with email, which turned into an entertaining enough anecdote to publish here.

The real reason HEY continued to be so widely covered by tech media, though, was its challenge to Apple's App Store policies after one of its updates was [rejected by the marketplace](https://www.protocol.com/hey-email-app-store-rejection) just a day after Casey's story was published. Much drama ensued - I have done my best to aggregate links to all the news stories on the subject in [a thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/extratown/comments/hbncn6/news_surrounding_hey_the_upcoming_email_service/) on the [*Extratone* subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/extratown) I recently started. I think [the public resistance by Basecamp's CTO David Heinemeier Hansson](https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/16/21293419/hey-apple-rejection-ios-app-store-dhh-gangsters-antitrust) was probably a PR move, which is fine, but all I wanted to contribute was a review of the actual function of HEY, itself. After reading posts by some of my favorite bloggers, however, I think it would be redundant. Kev Quirk argued "[Email Is Not Broken](https://kevq.uk/email-is-not-broken/)," to which Mike Stone responded "[Email Is Broken](https://mikestone.me/email-is-broken)." Additionally, *Business Insider*'s Lisa Eadicicco published an [in-depth review](https://www.businessinsider.com/hey-email-app-review-basecamp-inbox-2020-7) at the beginning of the month.

My singular commentary: I'm worried that subscription services that exclusively accept large yearly sums like HEY inevitably become the "country club for the most self-important emailers in business" which Casey spoke of. I guess we'll see.

*The following is an excerpt from [my letter to HEY](http://simp.ly/p/lw0h0R) asking for a early-access invite.*

## Email and I: An Abridged History

I am 26 years old, so I suppose I'm of the first generation that's never experienced life *without* email. I grew up on a farm in rural central Missouri and my dad was very much an early adopter. (You'd be surprised how e-enabled farmers were becoming in the early 2000s.) I cannot remember life before the humongous satellite dish was anchored in our front yard. Long before I had any reason to be online (or really understood what that meant,) he began and ended every day sitting at in front of a CRT on a corner desk, clacking away on a cigarette smoke-yellowed plastic keyboard for hours. I did not understand why, then, but in retrospect I realize that he was corresponding with a huge network of neighbors, politicians, family, and college friends via email lists/chains and that he depended on it both professionally and personally in a big way. As a single man living at least an hour's drive from a city of any size, I suppose my dad was predisposed to have a rich online life long before his suburban peers, which normalized it precociously for me.

The summer before my first grade year, my elementary school became the first in the district to have a computer lab (also the first air-conditioned room in the building,) so my high school graduating class was literally the very first to have had any digital curriculum - and an email address(!) - for the entirety of our public school experience. Because of this, I think most of us were trained to think of email as a tool for school work - it was eluded to by our computer teachers that our school email addresses were being monitored to make sure they remained so (obviously, they weren't.) As we grew into 6th-7th grade, however, we all seemed to end up with personal email addresses. I consider myself lucky to have experienced a very brief window - before instant messaging/early social networks became mainstream and SMS became even remotely pleasant to use - when my middle school friends and I corresponded exclusively by email when we weren't on the phone.

It still sounds a bit silly to say, but I've spent the past few years coming to believe more and more strongly that my first-generation iPhone changed my life forever in a profound way - *especially* my relationship with email. After watching [Steve Job's introduction at MacWorld 2007](https://www.howtogeek.com/674796/how-to-archive-or-delete-a-facebook-group/) live, I promised to skip a year of Christmas gifts if my mom would agreed to buy me one, and she did. Obviously, it was like nothing else I'd ever experienced, and it completely changed how I responded to and thought about technology. Before smartphones, there was no checking email outside of time in the computer lab, which was intended to be quite strictly-regulated. I had a real advantage when I started bringing my iPhone to school - absolutely no one knew what it was (a bizarre thought in contrast,) including teachers. Suddenly able to browse and read my inbox in class, at lunch, and on the bus, my use and consideration of email was propelled far ahead of my peers'.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/RealFriendsIn5Words?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#RealFriendsIn5Words</a> sent it to your email.</p>&mdash; David Blue (@NeoYokel) <a href="https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/906468410976079872?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 9, 2017</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

When I started an online magazine in 2016, I don't think I could've conceived of the extent to which running a modern media company - even one targeted toward tech-savvy, early-adopting youth - still involves email. I assumed that my audience rarely *actually read* from their inboxes and relied almost exclusively on social networks for content discovery, so I originally forwent any implementation of a newsletter. As I grew more and more interested in and engaged with the media beat, I was exposed to the email renaissance of the past 2-3 years thanks to services like Revue and Substack, saw that it was good, and decided to give it a try for myself. I launched our semi-regular newsletter in April, 2017 on the subjects of "**Division**, **Art**, and **Media**" and published a little over 30 issues over the course of 18 months. To be honest, I'm not sure I've ever had so much fun writing. 

Very shortly after it began, I observed our general engagement quadruple, and - quite selfishly - found the process of aggregation to be soothing and very mentally restorative. It exposed some pretty horrendous media consumption habits of mine, but it also offered a painless solution to them. As soon as everything I read became a potential item in the newsletter, I wasn't just reading for myself anymore (or at least, that's the mentality it gave me,) so I could no longer afford to dismiss particular subjects as easily or to skim so recklessly. I nurtured a much less chaotic media diet and found myself absorbing *a lot* more of what I wanted to without wasting so much time burning through links. I ended up feeling more focused in other, unrelated areas of my life, too. Obviously, I love email for that, and I miss writing that darn newsletter so much that I continuously look for excuses to do something similar.

My former Tech Editor loved email perhaps as much, but she's definitely the only person I've ever met who finds the medium as *entertaining* as I do. (If you're *really* committed, I just made a [Twitter Moment](https://twitter.com/i/events/1272514574420500481?s=13) full of all the best stuff I've ever posted about email - mostly jokes like "[patron saint of email marketing](https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/921352650788130822)," but there are one or two profound posts in there, too.) We realized one day that - aside from The Webbys - there are very few notable awards celebrating excellence in the email medium, so we decided our magazine would host the 2017 First Annual Email Awards. Unfortunately, I don't think anyone else had any idea what the heck we were trying to do, so we never received enough submissions. However, I noticed a great opening paragraph in the original announcement post which I thought made a worthy conclusion:

> Man has used electronic mail to intercommunicate, woo, build communities, topple businesses & civilizations, embezzle money, spread worms, distribute cluttered, broken links to discontinued Orscheln products, feed infants, set climate control, confirm identities, check bank account statuses, and lie to exhausted, slightly-conceited, and *newly self-published* professors. That's right - These Trillions of simple digijewels have purveyed *every single possible category of human communication*, and it's still growing strong.

I'm excited to give Hey a try - I hope you'll consider inviting me early. I'll even send my feedback if you so desire it! If not, I'll probably end up trying a paid subscription, anyway hehe. Either way, let me wish the best of luck to your team. Win or lose, I'm glad you're taking action on your complaints, unlike the rest of us.

Thank you!

# Google Is Not God of The Web

![Gurgle Crum Tile](https://i.snap.as/sA0Npx6.png)

Almost exactly two years ago, [I warned that Google was on track to replace God](https://bilge.world/google-soul-ledger-dont-be-evil) of us all. Last month, *The Verge*'s Dieter Bohn reported that [Google plans to begin accounting for "page experience" in its search rankings](https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/28/21272543/google-search-results-page-experience-load-time-contentfu-paint-layout-shift-top-stories-amp) beginning in 2021, later explaining in a [subsequent episode of *The Vergecast*](https://www.theverge.com/21274502/vergecast-podcast-407-trump-executive-order-social-media-hbo-max-launch): 

> Here is another example of the Chrome team coming up with a bunch of web standards and then the Search team making a bunch of incentives based on those standards.

It was news to me that in May, Google [launched](https://blog.chromium.org/2020/05/introducing-web-vitals-essential-metrics.html) a page called "Web Vitals" on its [**web.dev**](https://web.dev/vitals/) domain (which they've [apparently owned since November 2018](http://web.archive.org/web/20180415000000*/web.dev).) The company measures "page experience" based on three main criteria:

> - [**Largest Contentful Paint**](https://web.dev/lcp/) measures perceived load speed and marks the point in the page load timeline when the page's main content has likely loaded.
> - [**First Input Delay**](https://web.dev/fid/) measures responsiveness and quantifies the experience users feel when trying to first interact with the page.
> - [**Cumulative Layout Shift**](https://web.dev/cls/) measures visual stability and quantifies the amount of unexpected layout shift of visible page content.

[CoStar](https://www.costarastrology.com/neoyokel) just sent an oddly topical (and honestly, encouraging) notification:

![Costar Notification](https://i.snap.as/1Lo8JrN.jpeg)

I'm not a "real" web developer - nor do I mean to dictate to a single one - but I know enough theory to note that of this "core web" education operation centered around web.dev is operating on some irritating assumptions:

### 1. Smaller assets are ideal.

The simple assumption that it is always better to have the smallest page possible - that images should be resized and compressed to hell and typography/other elements should be few in number. Instantaneous page loads should be priority over any other standards of measure for a web page - like interesting design, for instance.

### 2. Minimalistic design is necessary.

The reality - for most of the Western world, at least - is that [average network speeds are exponentially increasing](https://www.forbes.com/sites/kevinmurnane/2018/12/11/heres-how-internet-speeds-fared-for-the-worlds-fastest-and-largest-countries-in-2018/#3f3124664976) year-by-year. In 2018:

> World-wide average mobile download speed was 22.82 Mbps (Megabits per second), an increase of 15.2% over 2017. Average upload speed was 9.19 Mbps, an increase of 11.6%. Fixed broadband speeds also increased. Average download speed increased 26.4% to 46.12 Mbps, while average upload speed came in at 22.44 Mbps, a 26.5% increase.

I may be a yokel, but these averages are still absolutely *inconceivable* to me. Our phones have as much RAM as my "studio" work desktop, now. 22.82 Mbps will reliably download *very* complex web pages nearly instantaneously. There is a very reasonable argument for essential services like search engines and news websites to conform to/adopt standards like AMP, but for the rest of The Open Web, ingenuity and risktaking should be *encouraged*, not discouraged, for the true good of all Peoplekind.

A term I haven't seen for a good while describes this ideology: "the **mobile web**," and it completely sucking ass is not a new concept. I've before referenced [an old complaint](https://www.theverge.com/2015/7/20/9002721/the-mobile-web-sucks) from 2015 by *The Verge*'s Editor-in-Chief, Nilay Patel (which the original article also links in different context in its last line):

> The entire point of the web was to democratize and simplify publishing using standards that anyone could build on, and it has been a raging, massively disruptive success for decades now. But the iPhone's depressing combination of [dominant mobile web marketshare](https://www.netmarketshare.com/browser-market-share.aspx?qprid=0&qpcustomd=1) and shitbox performance means we're all sort of ready to throw that progress away.

### 3. Google has the right to dictate "Best Practices."

The Mobile Web as a utility has its place, but it's certainly not a necessary or desirable ideal for the entirety of The Web, yet Google has the audacity to presume it can dictate what is and is not optimal web design. The URL in and of itself is extremely presumptuous - Google technically has every right to own web.dev, sure, but *should* it? The Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMP) program has already had an annoying effect on day-to-day browsing. I despise AMP links more than most things in life, just as I despise the name of the website *Search Engine Land* (which sounds like actual hell) who [also reported on this](https://searchengineland.com/the-google-page-experience-update-user-experience-to-become-a-google-ranking-factor-335252):

> If you have AMP, the good news is that the majority of AMP pages do extremely well in terms of page experience metrics, [Google Project Manager] Rudy Galfi said. It doesn’t mean that all AMP pages will have top page experience metrics, but AMP is built in a way to help with this.

Recently, I discovered an incredibly refreshing/affirming essay wrapped in a hand-build web experience called "[Rediscovering the Small Web](https://neustadt.fr/essays/the-small-web/)" by designer [Parimal Satyal](https://twitter.com/parimalsatyal), arguing for a different variety of Web presence:

> Modern web design principles are very rarely directed at regular people looking to make a website on something they are interested in. Instead, the focus is on creating websites that perform well:
> *Don't use too many colours. Write short, catchy headlines. Don't let content be too long. Optimise for SEO. Produce video content, attention span is decreasing. Have a an obvious call to action. Push your newsletter. Keep important information above the fold. Don't make users think. Follow conventions.*

I realize that the majority of Web utilization cannot "revert" to hand-coded plain HTML web pages hosted on Neocities, but there's something to be learned (or remembered, in my case) from Satyal's argument: **The Web's forgotten strength is <u>diversity</u>** (much like my country's, it would seem,) and the majority of users are being pushed by Google's search engine toward a very specific minority of URLs. We have not been *exploring* for a very long time:

> Instead of browsing, the web is for many an endless and often overwhelming stream of content and commentary picked out by algorithms based on what they think you already like and will engage with. It's the opposite of exploration.

"It is worth remembering a website does not have to be a product; it can also be art," argues Satyal. "The web is also a creative and cultural space that **need not confine itself to the conventions defined by commercial product design and marketing**." (Emphasis mine.) It's not just that The Web was *meant* to be more - nostalgia is definitely not my particular trip, if you didn't know - it's that it *can* be so much more. My [list of favorite Open Web projects](https://bilge.world/open) contains just a few examples of what I mean.

It's possible I am being *too* critical of Google. A [Twitter search](https://twitter.com/search?q=%22https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2020%2F5%2F28%2F21272543%2Fgoogle-search-results-page-experience-load-time-contentfu-paint-layout-shift-top-stories-amp%22&f=live) for the link to *The Verge*'s article reveals commentary like "[Experience, matters ;)](https://twitter.com/carlosriverao/status/1266051773472608257)," "[Web search moving forward](https://twitter.com/markupgrade/status/1266492831218139137)," and "[Halleluja!](https://twitter.com/reDDakteur/status/1266078587767177219)," so there are clearly users who are more than onboard, and not all of what Google has done for the web recently has been detrimental. It was also announced last month that [Chrome will begin blocking "resource-heavy" advertisements](https://blog.chromium.org/2020/05/resource-heavy-ads-in-chrome.html) by default and that [Google and Microsoft have been working together to improve spellcheck and scrolling in Chromium](https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/28/21273934/microsoft-google-chrome-edge-chromium-spellcheck-improvements). There's not much to feel about these announcements, but - as always - there is a whole lot to feel about Google as a company.

Google has [announced](https://dev.to/chromiumdev/announcing-web-dev-live-a-three-day-digital-event-2640) a three-day live digital event at the end of this month (June 30th-July 2nd) in which viewers will "celebrate our community's actions, learn modern web techniques and connect with each other." "Over three days, we'll share quick tips on aspects of modern web development," explains the company on its [web.dev/live page](https://web.dev/live/). I am planning to attend and bitch as much as I am allowed. [Stay tuned](https://bilge.world/subscribe) to hear a chronicle.

# Excerpt: Blimp's Burden, Chapter VI

![Blood - Blimp's Burden Chapter VI](https://i.snap.as/BEgMZAo.jpg)

## Two young men steal a wheel of cheese.

*This is an excerpt from my novel project, Blimp's Burden, about a jaded software engineer who’s new, ridiculously-eccentric boss presents a future which forces him to reckon with his mishandled grief. To support the novel's creation with art, funds, etc, please [email me](mailto:davidblue@extratone.com).*

In the right hour, the woodland springtime metamorphic processes of the neighboring Lake Geneva suburb’s in-betweens were in a paused state – the toads again hushed; the crickets tired, and the human populace, too. In the right hour, the fickle wind and the social owls were the only sound, and nothing moved but the sparse, light-footed doe in careful segments with her fawn. From the main gated lane of *The Nice, Huge Estate*, Lenny Lather slid through the muddy barrier and started bouncing West on the blacktop, brogues squeaking every third step. The overcasted clouds were having trouble deciding whether or not to let down their rain – as they had been all day – and the old, heavy early-March mist softened the yellow glow of the tall, buzzing streetlamps so much that he couldn’t help but intermittently wipe his eyes, for the spreading light convinced his mind that his eyelashes must’ve been wetted.

Theodore Pith’s big old house was now burrowed between two mismatched neighborhoods – the bleaker Easterly, which was too new for its alien trees to have recovered from the brutality of its development’s clear-cutting and contained within one of its central featureless backyards an unidentifiable creature which made all through the night the most unimaginably ghastly, disturbingly human child-like shrieking; the opposing Westerly’s trees further enough along in their regrowth – ten or twenty years perhaps – to appear more of the planet Earth to Manhattan-bred Lenny Lather, who still found the colorless destruction of suburbia unendingly upsetting, especially when coming down. In the interest of his regular withdrawal’s mitigation, he had already established two short, repeatable tracks and a longer, several mile-long loop which skirted him sufficiently around the East’s center to avoid hearing the shrieks in all but the stillest nights. Never in his years – on these walks he was *especially* reminded of just how many there were – had he been able to feel such absolute ownership of his surroundings. The eroding Earth slipping away from the hem of the warped, stained wood fences; the sidewalks, cracked, bent, sloped helter-skelter, often muddied in the troughs and joints – generally laying haphazardly in layers after having been steadily tossed about by the glacial forces of their intermixture with clay, precipitation, and the tumultuous temperature-dependent torture of the two – these were his, entirely, in the right hour. Between two and five in the morning when the earliest risers would blearily revive their dewy automobiles from long, silent hibernation, the whole world – everything in his sight and more at any moment – it was all *his*, without a single worthy challenger.

In the right hour, the roads were completely and totally abandoned – for the New Yorker, an unfathomable absolute – and all humanity was at rest. In the right hour, Lenny Lather was the appointed guardian of the worn domesticity of a small nation, though the lonely occupation was astoundingly lax, for in the miles and miles of empty streets he had already traversed in his nightly holidays from the World of Pith, he had yet to encounter a single unexpected factor or minutely threatening presence. Since shortly after his December arrival, he’d walked through even the most frigid mornings. Of course, the stillness had then been *even more* otherworldly, and Lenny was curious to see how his new most private domain would change with the seasons. Though the auxiliary guest room which he now called home was no smaller or less hospitable than the master bedroom of his late Hudson Yards flat shared with his late Wife, it proved to be a poor respite from Theodore Pith, who treated him – when they were “home” at *Nice, Huge* – as the puppy he never had, and expected his participation to remain entirely vulnerable to his any whim. Granted – in their shared abuse of amphetamines, cocaine, and assorted other stimulants – Lenny Lather was vastly more prepared for the games than any circadian guest could’ve possibly been. At first, the ten-foot door of his dawn-facing room had closed without latching, but with the warmth and moisture brought with the Midwestern Spring, the most secure state in which the engorged wood could be forcibly arranged still left a half-inch crack, and Lather’s last chance of privacy was lost.

The latest favorite pastime of *Nice, Big*’s Master necessitated a willing, capable driver, and – as keeping a single Butler (much less an entire household staff) was proving extremely difficult for him – Lenny Lather was the sole pick of the draft. In the earliest hours of one Tuesday morning in February, he’d been pleasantly dosing and drooling on his laptop after an evening of obsessive, incoherent notetaking when the huge door had been kicked ajar by a deep black, blindingly shiny oxford with excessively violent force. Attached to the shoe in an equally blinding penguin tuxedo, towering bowler hat, and cartoonish fake mustache was the Great, Blown Pith.

“Hope you’re not busy,” he’d said quite loudly to the lolling Lather, leaning and tilting his head into the lamp light, which had dislodged his monocle and briefly occupied him with untangling its chain.

…

“You’re not *busy*, are ya?!” he’d shouted, tapping the shiny brass lion’s head of his shiny black cane against the vanity… then swatting it with a flicking wrist… then clubbing it with a full, two-handed homerun swing – taking huge, vaguely cat nose-shaped gouges from the surface of the wood. The splintery wood chips had rained down upon the hunched Lenny; he’d stirred with one found its way in his open mouth – he’d chewed it slowly and swallowed it, but he still had not awoken. Nevertheless, Theodore Pith’s coked-up enthusiasm couldn’t possibly have yielded to common decencies like his guest’s nighttime peace.

…

“SHOOT, LENNY,” he’d screamed in his companion’s ear, having traversed the room to his bedside.

“I SURE HOPE YOU’RE NOT BUSY RIGHT NOW!”

…

Finally, he’d resorted to tickling Lenny’s nose with the ornament, which had reeked with the urinal smell of metal polish – the sudden, overwhelming delivery of which to the writer’s olfactory nerves finally causing ample alarm in his nervous system to justify bringing him abruptly back to his life and deluded host.

“I need a favor. The Duesie’s warming up. We’re going for a ride.”

Unable to form a linguistic response, Lenny Lather had obeyed Theo’s frenzied, repeating instructions and stumbled into the matching suit he’d brought over his arm – wondering with marginal, arrested clarity at how well-tailored it was for him. He had not the soundness of perception to protest when Pith had whipped a deep black, blindingly shiny bowtie around his already-congested esophagus, nor when he’d adheased the huge, itchy matching fake moustache to his upper lip and nearly pulled the matching Tower of Bowler all the way down over his ears. He had been unresponsive when he’d been sat on the bench under the agonizing fluorescent lights of the laundry room, affixed with deep black, blindingly shiny matching oxfords, and asked if he smoked and how well he could say *guffaw.*

…

“Just wait… you have no idea… you have no idea how much fun this is going to be.”

Lenny Lather had not… *could not* have made a sound through the confusing nonsense of his waking pre-Great Depression dream, but when the old servant’s door had been opened before him and set the heartless, single-digit Winter wind upon his very soul, he had all at once arrived in the world, laughing and whooping together with Theodore Pith.

“Jesus *Christ!*” he’d screamed as they’d hobbled to the stable, where a devilishly dark red Model J Duesenberg had sat shivering in a rough idle, staring out the retrofitted garage door with its basketball-sized lights as if it was, indeed, a flesh-and-blood steed that had just been frightened awake by a thunderstorm, but the sky had been as clear as it would’ve been from an asteroid – as it is only on the coldest nights – and almost comically dominated by the setting, gluttonously luminescent moon. Theodore had then grabbed a screwdriver from the workbench and bent down to remove the license plate – which had said *BLOOD* in big black bold block letters – and its containing frame. By the time he had settled into the frigid red leather of the exposed, roofless driver’s seat, Lenny Lather was full-to-bursting with adrenaline and laughing out huge streams of breathy steam. From behind him in the cabin, Pith had been *guffawing* plumes, too, as he’d briefly ignited his cocaine-sprinkled mustache instead of the bratwurst-sized cigar between his teeth. The smell of burning human hair had accented his explanation of the old car’s transmission and its direct path from source-to-nose for Pith had required a brief, unplanned intermission as it induced without warning his violent heaving – still part-*guffawing* – hanging half out of his beautifully-upholstered suicide door.

As he had spewed – expertly sparing the swoop of the gleaming waxy fender – Lenny had found a pair of deep black, blindingly shiny gloves and – after less grinding than you would imagine, to his credit – first gear, setting the whole dastardly circus in motion.

“Where to, Sire?” Lenny had asked, nose lifted to an untenable altitude in a pitiful approximation of an accent that’d never actually been used before by any person or persons in all of history, struggling for breath.

“Left at the gates, Barnsward, old chap,” Theodore had replied in a contrasting fashion after again sitting upright from his heaves and taking a breath, ironing out – if anything – the flatness of his perforating Ohio Ds and Ps, resulting in such a culturally destructive racket that it had set both of them in uncontrollable, cloudy fits lasting long after Lather had swerved the great length of the car from the gravel to his abandoned asphalt retreat. The two had continued their banter down that soul-suckingly flat vector, one-upping each other’s etymologic barbarity against the savage thievery of the heatless wind.

“Now to star-board, Budleigh, my good fellow!”

…

“Right-o, as you say, sir!”

…

“Down to the *pu-hb* for a *spaht* of *brahn*-dee with me *mae-its*!”

…

“*Oncemo-ar* right, pip pip!”

…

“By *jah-lee*, there we are!”

…

After the entirety of Northern European history had been decimated and subsequently forgotten, the Duesenberg named *BLOOD* had turned its orange, googley-eyed stare and narrow whitewalled hooves up the reflective, freshly-painted access of the new 24-hour grocery in the no-man’s-land between the cookie-cutter stares of the neatly-rowed Easterly neighborhood and the droning respiration of Interstate 43, two miles distant. It was 2:12 in the morning and most of the greasy-haired night stocking shift had been halfway through their third smoke break, circled around a store-used picnic table 50 yards from the far sliding airlock doors. The first to spot *BLOOD* had been the second shortest of the lot, whose weary scrutiny along the truest radian to the West from under his sweaty beanie in her entrance she had crossed, and the depth of her red as he first spied it had caused him vertigo – as if he would fall in – and cast upon the shorter-than-average length of his being an all-consuming existential doubt. The tallest and loudest of them had faced squarest the white faux-brick wall of the box building and was at that moment engaged upon a spirited rant about where and where’nt and when a vapist ought to buy his Suck juice between long, gasping Sucks from his super-shiny Suck box. Of course, the arrival of a customer even at such a late hour did not warrant notice at a huge, broadly-servicing operation like theirs, but as *BLOOD* had crept through all four reflective yellow-checkered pedestrian crossings, closing without a flinch, and the details of her occupying caricatures had become more and more numerous, she had stolen the attention of the huddle, one-by-one, and elicited from each the rarest under-breath profanity of true, unmolested wonder.

“*Jesus Christ*,” had said the shortest.

“*Holy fuck,*” had said the youngest.

“*Gee whiz*,” had said the oldest.

And the Sucking tallest, having realized he’d lost his audience, had been the last to turn and follow their eyes *BLOOD*’s way as she had halted coolly in front of the purely white glowing concrete leading into the closest customer entrance, and had – without the gradual exposure over the length of her approach that his peers had been afforded – dropped his Suck box and exclaimed at the sudden, undiluted immensity of the spectacle, simply, “*FUCK!*”

The Sucking’s *FUCK* and the splitting shatter of his Suck against the glass of their smoking table had reached the two arrivees – albeit in a muted way – and through the onset of their frostbite’s early stages even further stoked their already-uncontrollable boyish giggling. Theodore Pith had paused briefly to affix his monocle as firmly as possible in his eye socket and stuff down his spasmic *guffaws* with a few lip-smacking puffs of his then successfully-lit cigar before swinging his right door open.

“Stay here and wait at the ready, my good… my *best* Bagsy! I shan’t be a twinkle,” he had declared, clicking it lightly shut again and turning on his heels toward the pale light of the store, twirling his cane in dramatically shortened strides so as to reproduce the oversped effect of a silent motion picture, puff-puffing away. As the doors had sensed him and indiscriminately whirred aside, he had turned to the smokers – most of whom had still been reeling, grabbing for their hair – and bobbed the bulk of his big black bowler toward their communion with his gloved black fingers by the brim.

“Tally-*ho*, my boys!” he had shouted, sending Lenny Lather’s wide open face toward the floor of the idling car as he doubled over himself in the first spontaneously asphyxiating, tear-lobbing laughter he’d yet to experience in the 21st century. As Theodore had entered the masterpiece of the boxed store’s bleakness in his cane twirling, head swinging, cigar puffing shuffle, he had made sure to stay his instinct to *sneak* for a swift, full-chat *dart*, instead, and the on-duty leather-faced embodiment of tedium’s wrath beneath his lone lit lane light had looked up from his *People* Magazine just in time to see the heel of a deeply black oxford and the last shiny inches of flowing black coattails disappear behind the potato sack endcap of the far Aisle 1. He’d hesitated, chin against palm, holding his next glossed page perpendicularly erect between his tightened thumb and index finger for a long few seconds of fantastic stillness – had hastily attempted a diagnostic of his present senses – before a locomotive-like segmented tube of cigar smoke had risen from against the light tiles and unsoiled trimming to intersect his line-of-sight where it met the darkened deli, recessed in the far wall from his hunch, the motion startling him into his own throat-clearing, counter-rounding, key-jingling, *excuse me*-shouting march toward the lumpy potato sacks and the climbing dissipation of the most unbelievable violation. As he had jingled, he had reflected on the few occasions in which he’d ever smelled tobacco smoke in *his* store: all incidental, most very brief, and many followed by a lengthy, unreasonably self-deprecating apology. To just walk in his Temple of Domestic Fulfilment during this most Serene Time of Silent Service, spewing orange nicotine on his premium, Food & Drug Administration-blessed body and blood offering to the middle class was surely in ignorance, but could have even been *in spite*. Regardless, the transgression was worthy of the most merciless wrath, and he had been selected as its willing, capable vessel. In just the fifteen seconds it’d taken him to jingle his way to Aisle 1, he’d thought himself and his leather into flash-broiling, fast-rising fury.

Perhaps the least expected sight that could have possibly greeted this Apostle of Appraisal on the far side of Aisle 1 – as he rounded the potato sack endcap and filled his *excuse me* lungs in preparation through his nose – was the labored lifting of the 125-pound eldest child of the new, Parisian-trained, full-time, certified cheese artisan – whom the store had just won out of 175 competitors in a region-wide raffle of her pilot program – by the dashing, swinging, and smoking real-life manifestation of a young Rich Uncle Pennybags, yet shock did not long halt the Keys & Leather.

“Sir! Excuse me!”

…

“*Excuse me!* Sir!”

…

Theodore Pith – having reevaluated the girth of his intended booty – had propped his shiny black cane against the sill of the refrigerator and popped each slack bottom up off his oxfords from his shins before squatting over the massive Holy Wheel of the Artisan where it lay displayed on a sturdy bespoke plinth.

…

“Sir! You need to put out that cigar… the cigar – put it out immediately!”

Keys & Leather had the odd inability to both shout and shuffle at the same time, so he’d only made it to the pomegranate juice by the time Pith had mustered enough momentum to swing the cheese child into a high enough pendulum to carry it stably facing forward under his chin with his two hands spaced evenly on the Great Wheel’s bottom.

…

“Sir! I’m going to have to ask you to put that down… That is a four thousand dollar item… If you want to buy it, we need to go about-”

“…now, see here!” Pith had replied with great effort, in the midst of weighing in his mind the worth of the cane as a casualty, then of the monocle, too, which had fallen out while he was weighing, and of his own physical intelligence, and whether or not it was capable of retrieving the cane by its brass lion’s head handle via the top of a flicking foot without losing his balance. Keys & Leather, meanwhile, had been tortured at great length witnessing – in Theodore’s gravitational struggle – the Cuban’s ashes knocked all over the precious round Immanuel; the artisan’s Beloved, Chosen son of cheese – a nauseating sensation of loss overwhelming all hope of his store’s defense. The Terrible Theodore had at once noticed his hesitation *and* arrived upon a plan to leave no prop behind. He had leaned forward with the girth of the wheel and closed the remaining few feet between them, advancing with the huge mass of Nazarethian dairy to bear it all down upon the unsuspecting Leather, who in his grief for the prized wheel was far too slow to deflect its incoming mass.

“Now, see here, chum!” Pith had forced from the furthest possible extremis of his best mob mouth as he transferred his burden all at once to its most concerned party, who collapsed against the multilayered tables that made up the fresh cookie display, with the weight of the wheel on his belly. As the stunned Leather struggled to separate himself without further soiling the only item in his store that sold for double a month’s paycheck, Theodore had replaced his monocle and returned for his cane in a single stride, which he’d then used after a return step to the pile of chocolate chip, almond nut, and fuming night manager to rap loose with the snout of the terrible brass cat Leather’s white knuckle-tight grip on the wheel with a lampoonish *haha!* before rolling the freed cheese toward the door in a villainous cackle.

“Man, *come on*,” the defeated Leather had yelled halfheartedly from his pile of sweets, struggling against the awkward, slippery boxes for enough footing to stand. His efforts, though, were interrupted after a time by the abrupt mute of Pith’s cackling in the second swooshing of the front sliding doors – he had missed his last chance of pursuit. It had all been in vain – he’d failed to guard the crown jewel of the whole suburb. As he had given up the chase and the cheese and slumped once more against the ruined pile, the ridiculousness of the crime against him nearly cracked a smile, but soon was deterred by the very real thought of explaining what had happened to his General Manager when she arrived in just five hours. After a moment, there, covered in cookies, dust, ashes, and shame, he had quietly begun to sob.

After he had regained control of his diaphragm, Lenny Lather had been amused, outside, by the varying velocities in which the smokers of the night shift gave in to their curiosities about the presence of the seven-figure collectible and its purpose in waiting at its now healthier idle in front of their grocery store in the loneliest time of a Tuesday morning. The first and the bravest had been the one who first spotted their intrusion – the shortest – if only because he had remained entirely convinced for the duration that *BLOOD* and its two, period-dressed occupants were nothing but an apparition of his dead Grandfather and Great Uncle like others he’d thought he’d seen before, and – though he’d been terrified by the clarity of this realest visit yet, he’d been irritated more than anything, and wanted to know “why the hell can’t you just leave me *alone*?!” The others behind him had been staggered in the proximity to the waiting car they had achieved – the lesser and most cowardly being the largest – the Sucking evangelist – who had been waiting for the great automobile to leave so he could forge the exchange of his broken Suck box for a new one from the back. In the delirium of his exhaustion and progressing frostbite, Lenny Lather had thought the image of the men where they were would make for an interesting, organic graph on the nature of courage – their positions simply representing their unaltered datapoints, and had been considering how best to deal with or respond to the nearer, deluded one, who had by then come close enough to the elegant, professionally polished front-right fender to reach out and touch it with his unwashed hands, and appeared to be taking the matter under serious consideration. He’d been seconds away from finally deciding between his idiotic ideas for a joke response when by far the largest wheel of cheese he’d ever seen had come rolling out of the opening doors onto the concrete, followed closely behind by Theodore Pith who’d still had three-quarters or more of his cigar left to smoke and apparently switched to cheap mob clichés in his brief absence.

“Haste, Don Lenny!” he’d yelled, re-opening his closest cabin door to chuck his cane in first. He’d then straddled the great wheel to position it against the step before making a scene of grunting and huffing against its side with his full weight. Again, the bewildered smokers had fallen silent – they did not recognize the ridiculous delicacy because it was special inventory and could only be handled by the Holy Artisan herself. Lather had started revving the huge old straight-8 to answer Pith’s urgency, who had found himself fresh out of phrases after the wheel had finally succumbed to its capture and rolled into the footwell.

“Make haste, make haste, my boy!” he’d shouted, diving theatrically into the covered back seat, head-first, to which his icing chauffer had responded by revving the behemoth and briskly popping her clutch, which had lurched the pair into the last, getaway stage of their late grocery heist. As *BLOOD*’s razor-edged hood ornament had sliced through the night by the dumbstruck smokers, Theodore Pith was unable to think of anything to shout at them as he passed but for “bada-bing, bada-*BOOM!*”

Though the Lake Geneva Police Department was shown the security footage of that first theft by management, the theatricality of their matching getup had inadvertently obscured their identities, and the organization’s extreme deficit of imagination had left them stumped by the lack of license plates on the car, despite the free and effortless ability of just about any casual enthusiast of early American luxury automobiles and/or lackadaisical disciple of the Concours religion to immediately identify *BLOOD* by *name* from the grainiest image, if consulted. If anything, their incompetence rewarded Pith and Lather’s continued focus on the products of the same store’s cheese artisan, as intelligence on the state of her latest flagship incubation was freely available with no more effort than it took to simply stop by her display amid regular shopping trips. Twice in two weeks, they stole both of her replacements for the biggest child without any significant alternation of their method, which frustrated her and the management nearly to the point of crises, and quickly lost all potential for fun in a third attempt – their kicks were in their absurdity, not their *effectiveness*, and neither of them cared much for the cheese.

# Star Trek Online Lives

![USS Bataan over New Khittomer](https://i.snap.as/OwEhc8a.png)

## The ancient IP’s MMO is still Online, albeit with some disappointing discontinuations.

I entertained fantasies about a *Star Trek* MMO since first experiencing the genre through *Eve Online* and *World of Warcraft* in early adolescence. The idea of commanding my own starship in a universe of other “captains” alongside a hand-picked bridge crew was a beguiling one to myself and many others. This year, the game celebrated its [ten-year anniversary](https://trekmovie.com/2020/01/29/star-trek-online-legacy-celebrate-10-years-of-sto-with-jeri-ryan-and-sonequa-martin-green/) (aligning well with the [continued involuntary beat](https://bilge.world/about) of this blog.) I’m currently in the midst of my annual check-in with STO and thought an exploration of this most-consequential video game of my life’s history would be an appropriate undertaking.

The execution of today’s final, Arc Games-owned and maintained product is a particularly long and interesting one. As [Justin Olivetti chronicled for *Engadget*](https://www.engadget.com/2014-11-22-the-game-archaeologist-perpetuals-star-trek-online.html), the license for *Star Trek Online* was originally [bought](https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/perpetual-entertainment-to-develop-and-publish-star-trek-massively-multiplayer-online-game) and developed on by Perpetual Entertainment, which was assaulted by [a lawsuit](https://web.archive.org/web/20150127173934/http:/massively.joystiq.com/2007/12/12/perpetual-plot-thickens-lawsuit-filed) and extensive layoffs in December, 2006. The company was sued by Kohnke Communications for allegedly selling "valuable assets like the Star Trek Online license" to an affiliated entity called P2 entertainment. Clever. A quote from the complaint as [reported by *Ten Ton Hammer*](https://web.archive.org/web/20150128203353/http:/www.tentonhammer.com/node/15616):

> "On information and belief, the assets transferred to P2 include Perpetual Entertainment trademarks and copyrights, the perpetual.com domain name, and assets related to Star Trek Online, including code and the license… Perpetual received less than market value for the assets it transferred to P2, and the transfer made Perpetual insolvent (or worsened Perpetual's existing insolvency)."

[Perpertual’s STO](https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Star_Trek_Online_(Perpetual_Entertainment)) was significantly different from today’s MMO. Instead of captaining one’s own starship, “players would have taken on the role of an officer who would be part of a crew of a starship,” echoing old legacy titles like [*Star Trek: Bridge Commander*](https://www.ign.com/articles/2002/02/22/star-trek-bridge-commander-review). 

> The proposed solution was that players could own smaller ships like fighters and minor spaceships, but the big ones -- like the Galaxy class -- would instead be adventure hubs with explorable, detailed interiors.

![Perpetual Entertainment's Star Trek Online](https://i.snap.as/dswfpYb.jpg)

I was 14 in 2008 when I joined the original post-Perpetual Entertainment STO IRC channel when the game's license was [first transferred](https://web.archive.org/web/20150203103236/http:/massively.joystiq.com/2008/01/14/star-trek-online-is-under-new-management/) to Cryptic Studios. In fact, this channel was the only reason I left IRC clients open on my computers for years. It was exciting to find a community of people who were looking forward to participating in a *Star Trek* MMO as much as I was. I originally went by the (very cringey) username "crazyhooligin," under which my current STO account is [still registered](https://ufplanets.com/member.php?13827-DavidBlue). In the IRC channel, I met Sata - host of the now-defunct [MMO Junkies podcast](https://eileenlong-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/g/personal/david_eileenlonglcsw_com/EV9rOQgmdINNpSWg2t_vXLwBMEMHCkqPUHOsoEX58AdkAg) and ex-Perpetual developer. He and the STORadio crew accepted me into their Teamspeak conversations despite how strange and unsocialized I was. I learned how [extensive](https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Star_Trek_Online_(Perpetual_Entertainment)) and [beautiful](https://johneaves.wordpress.com/2009/06/25/more-vulcans-from-the-perpetual-files/) their development had been. One wonders what Cryptic did with the original game and art assets and who technically owns them now.

<iframe width="auto" height="auto" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Fhed2yKVYwY?controls=0" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

After [acquiring the rights](https://web.archive.org/web/20150203103236/http:/massively.joystiq.com/2008/01/14/star-trek-online-is-under-new-management/) to make the game in early-2008, Cryptic was legally compelled to come up with a completed product in two years’ time as then-Executive Producer [Stephen D’Angelo](https://sto.gamepedia.com/Stephen_D'Angelo) explained on the [100th episode of the *STOked* podcast](https://youtu.be/a0tP0YrlJB0):

> We were under a very massive deadline to deliver the game. We had acquired the license from Perpetual and Perpetual’s license had an expiration date on it, and we had to ship the game before the expiration date or we would lose the license.

*STOked* also provided an excellent historical account of the acquisition entitled “[How Cryptic Saved Star Trek Online](https://youtu.be/Fhed2yKVYwY).” By late-Fall, 2009, *Star Trek Online* [entered Closed Beta](https://trekmovie.com/2009/10/22/star-trek-online-begins-closed-beta-trekmovie-giving-away-keys/), which I somehow acquired a key for in the name of [STOHolic.com](https://web.archive.org/web/20100521081251/http:/www.stoholic.com/) (a blogger site which represents one of my first web projects ever.) I was dual-booting Windows 7 Beta on my 2008 MacBook, which only supported 2 of its 4GB of RAM. The resulting performance was not optimal, but I was tremendously excited just to participate. Somewhere, there are at least three 480p handicam videos of Closed and Open Beta gameplay taken from over my shoulder, but I could not find them at the time of this writing. Comparatively, beta looked drastically different from the property that’s online today. In [this video of the original entry tutorial](https://youtu.be/vH73ATZ96-w), we are introduced to the game’s basic controls by the voice of Zachary Quinto of J.J. Abrams fame as the new Emergency Medical Hologram in godawful dropshadowed text. The lighting is dated, the blue-based user interface even more so.

![Star Trek Online Closed Beta](https://i.snap.as/t0aZwfB.jpg)

The hair was bad and the textures of the armor, worse. So was mine, though. I uploaded two videos under my STOholic name: an [unboxing of the Collector’s Edition](https://youtu.be/pqGll-DZp6s) and what appears to be [the definitive YouTube tutorial](https://youtu.be/ghUJm9YWiVc) to run *Star Trek Online* on Mac OSX using the (now defunct) wineskin wrapper. Though I was sixteen years old, I appear to be about eight. Endless waves of ground enemies, pressing the "1" key hundreds of thousands of times to whittle them away with my phaser rifle. There were bugs on top of bugs. My favorite was a swap between one's ground and space avatars: a gigantic captain would appear in space and a little ship would appear on the ground.

Four years ago, Lead Developer Al Rivera wrote “[History of Star Trek Online – a Retrospective](https://www.arcgames.com/en/games/star-trek-online/news/detail/10095363-history-of-star-trek-online-–-a-retrospective)” – a blog post detailing the chronology of the game from its February 2nd, 2010 release date – about a week after my 16th birthday, for which my mom bought me my first and only gaming PC. I have never been very good at video games, and *Star Trek Online* has been no exception. After 10 years, my main Captain – Ambassador Kuvak – is still not doing adequate DPS to hold my own in [Task Force Operations](https://sto.gamepedia.com/Task_Force_Operation), from what I understand. My 15-16-year-old self chose a Science Captain but wanted to fly the great (engineering/tank-focused) cruisers of *The Original Series*, *The Next Generation*, and the latter's movies. This is possible, but not necessarily advised. Generally, one specs an Engineering Captain to tank, a Tactical Captain for DPS, and a Science Captain for “[exotic DPS](https://youtu.be/v5by0pRMNx8)” and light healing. I managed to level a single science character – the original – through to the max ranks using little intelligence and a lot of persistence. Later in life, I’ve learned the patience for a more deliberate approach, but still struggle to make the numbers.

## The Exploration System

For many *Star Trek* fans, *Star Trek Online*’s combat feels excessive. Or at least, that’s what you’d think. The current reality is that search engine results for “[too much combat in STO](https://www.google.com/search?sxsrf=ALeKk02Vz7pYJlsD1Vn0gDTEJIsbJM6m6g%3A1589967215922&source=hp&ei=b_nEXvrvNZCstQbVuqu4Aw&q=star+trek+online+too+much+combat&oq=star+trek+online+too+much+combat&gs_lcp=CgZwc3ktYWIQAzoECCMQJzoFCAAQgwE6AggAOgYIABAWEB46CAghEBYQHRAeOgQIIRAKOgUIIRCgAToHCCEQChCgAVDFAlidHmDbH2gAcAB4AIABcYgBhhSSAQQzMS4xmAEAoAEBqgEHZ3dzLXdpeg&sclient=psy-ab&ved=0ahUKEwi64-24kcLpAhUQVs0KHVXdCjcQ4dUDCAk&uact=5)” are virtually nill. There are some comments on [*Massively Overpowered* posts](https://massivelyop.com/2015/03/05/star-trek-online-installs-memorials-for-leonard-nimoy-and-all-those-lost/), a [year-old blog post in *Contains Moderate Peril*](http://www.containsmoderateperil.com/blog/2019/2/27/star-trek-online-non-combat-missions) by Roger Edwards, an old [Ryan Somna take](https://ideonexus.com/2010/01/25/star-trek-online-explore-strange-new-worlds-seek-out-new-life-and-new-civilizations-and-kill-them-looking-for-science-in-star-trek-online-beta/), and… that’s about it. There was a definite (and entirely reasonable) argument against the amount of combat across the community early in the game’s development, but it looks like the arguers have simmered down and/or given up. This is also reasonable, considering its now ten-year lifespan. The only trouble is that non-combat options in *Star Trek Online* have actually diminished over the years.

![Star Trek Online Romulan Borg](https://i.snap.as/BicLSE5.jpg)

The original [Exploration System](https://sto.gamepedia.com/Exploration_Cluster) was an ingenious and significant idea that “[used automated tools to facilitate large quantities of widely varied content](https://www.arcgames.com/en/games/star-trek-online/news/detail/6002963-exploration-cluster-removal).” Unfortunately, the result was “nothing close to what [Cryptic] originally planned.” Instead of inspiring variety, Exploration Clusters ended up becoming the most repetitive activity in the game – nothing more than a good source of crafting materials. The missions were generic and the environments simply randomly combined segments of the same interior textures. Procedurally generated environments would hit the mainstream conversation years later with [*No Man’s Sky*](https://www.polygon.com/2016/8/12/12461520/no-mans-sky-review-ps4-playstation-4-pc-windows-hello-games-sony), which was written about in two fascinating articles by Raffi Khatchadourian in [*The New Yorker*](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/18/world-without-end-raffi-khatchadourian) and Chris Baker in [*Rolling Stone*](https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-news/no-mans-sky-how-games-are-building-themselves-104779/):

> Using procedural generation isn’t simply about offloading the creative process onto an algorithm – the real challenge is that it requires developers to teach an algorithm the difference between good and bad game design.

Perhaps if *Star Trek Online*’s initial development window had not been so limited, Cryptic would’ve had time and resources to pioneer something truly *Trek* and extraordinary in the exploration system, but it ended up having to kill the idea altogether – no amount of [Change.org petitions](https://www.change.org/p/cryptic-bring-exploration-to-star-trek-online-and-sto-back-to-the-true-roots-of-star-trek) could prevent this.

## The Foundry

Perhaps *the* most innovative feature *Star Trek Online* contributed to gaming as a whole came to the live server in Spring, 2011. It was called [The Foundry](https://sto.gamepedia.com/The_Foundry), and it allowed players access to a diluted form of the same mission creation tools Cryptic themselves used to create content, enabling the community to publish its own playable stories. The result was a wonder virtually inexpressible in words. In player-made Foundry Missions, I found joy, wonder, sorrow, and insight – truly everything and more than one could ever want from fiction. Throughout 2013-2014 my girlfriend at the time and I ran regular [Foundry missions](https://sto.gamepedia.com/Foundry:List_of_missions) together along with couple friends in our fleet. Unfortunately, I cannot remember a single specific mission (aside from [*Unholy Alliances*](https://youtu.be/zrXTZfHk4HQ), I think,) but I remember the storytelling. I remember laughing at, dwelling on, and even crying for the characters we were introduced to. There were farming-oriented missions and some fairly rough drafts, sure, but the vast majority of the content was deliberately and delicately considered, especially the [Foundry Spotlight](https://www.arcgames.com/en/games/star-trek-online/news/detail/3027483) series, which highlighted player-created stories of a particular quality and intrigue.

![Ambassador Class](https://i.snap.as/CGCgrAb.jpg)

Last April, however, [Arc retired the Foundry forever](https://www.arcgames.com/en/games/star-trek-online/news/detail/11102923) – perhaps the worst possible news – stating “the legacy knowledge required to maintain the Foundry at our quality standards is no longer available,” meaning – as [Rodger Edwards notes](http://www.containsmoderateperil.com/blog/2019/3/4/cryptic-to-close-the-foundry) – that all developers with their hands, hearts, and heads in the project had long since departed the company. The community reaction was heartbreaking. On Reddit, a group of mission authors and devotees [committed to capturing](https://www.reddit.com/r/sto/comments/ayobu4/one_mans_quest_to_save_the_foundry/) as many Foundry Missions as possible on video in the month between the announcement and date of death. User [waimser](https://www.reddit.com/user/waimser/) lamented the loss of the Foundry as a critical hit to *Star Trek Online*’s endgame:

> Once you've played through the story missions and built your ship, the foundry is what's left, and it has some damn good stuff.

The group even created a Google Docs spreadsheet to coordinate the effort. Another created [a thread in the *Star Trek Online* forums](https://www.arcgames.com/en/forums/startrekonline#/discussion/1247628/keeping-up-with-the-foundry-after-the-foundry-general-psa-preserved-content) dedicated to “aggregating the various channels with Foundry content and providing those links to you and updating them as necessary.” In [an interview for *Gamesindustry.biz*](https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2020-02-11-how-star-trek-online-managed-to-live-long-and-prosper), Al Rivera suggested that the secret to the title’s longevity in which his team had been “strategically successful” was knowing when and when not to make drastic changes. “Don't change the fundamentals of what players love about your game,” he suggested.

## Community

Though *STOked* and *STORadio* have long since been off the air, the Roddenberry Podcast Network’s *PriorityOne* is still going strong, having just recorded [its 460th episode](https://priorityonepodcast.com/460-rebranding-kirk-casting-groupees-priority-one-a-roddenberry-star-trek-podcast/). As I discovered last year, the game’s Twitch community is also thriving. [Layiena](https://www.twitch.tv/layriena)’s streams are incredible because - while he understands theory as well as the other broadcasters in the STO Twitch community - it’s his incredible skills at live Captain commentary (calling out abilities and other command inputs as if he really is in the captain’s chair.) It may sound cringey (and perhaps it would be to many,) but his thoroughness and accuracy actually 1) make it seem pretty darn cool to me and 2) are hugely valuable in helping the viewer understand what he’s doing. After some three years, I know my one rotation fairly well, but only three or four of its steps by name – not even remotely well enough to do what he does. Unfortunately, it appears as though he’s been inactive since last year.

[Sphynx](https://www.twitch.tv/sphynx_sto)’s streams also have an especially professional feel – he is excellent at calling out his actions as well, if perhaps without so much intensity. His Norwegian sensibility is wonderful: when I introduced myself as being around in the community since 2008, he remarked “that’s strange considering the game has only been out since 2010.” Nigh-universally common threads among them: imperturbable kindness to their audience and an impressively wholesome commitment to *actually having fun*. Though I’m far from deeply saturated with Twitch culture as a whole, I’ve watched my fair share of *Eve Online*, *World of Warships*, and *Gran Turismo Sport* streams, and – while all of these have incredible communities – there’s none quite like the sincerity of the *Star Trek* fraternity.

A few weeks ago, I departed my own derelict STO fleet for the aptly-named [United Federation of Planets](https://ufplanets.com/) which has over three thousand (presumably at least semi-active) members in its [fleet armada](https://www.arcgames.com/en/games/star-trek-online/news/detail/9436793). The fleet website has [user profiles](https://ufplanets.com/member.php?13827-DavidBlue), a [very active forum](https://ufplanets.com/forum.php), and a [Discord server](https://discord.gg/M6UKBVj) – everything I could possibly ask for. So far, I have been welcomed with [overwhelming positivity](https://ufplanets.com/showthread.php?78194-Application-DavidBlue), and I’m grateful. In a prompt posted on both [their forums](https://ufplanets.com/showthread.php?78339-Your-Favorite-Part-of-the-Community) and [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/sto/comments/gpyxcm/your_favorite_part_of_the_community/), I asked players what their favorite part of the community is. Oddly enough, some of the responses I got from the latter were quite jaded: “I really enjoy the love and respect the PVP community gets. No, wait...” [Alex Rowe for *The Startup*](https://medium.com/swlh/star-trek-online-ten-years-old-still-fun-eacd72b1380):

> [The game’s subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/sto/) is full of folks who are tired of the game because they’ve blasted through all the content, but as someone who has only seen about 1/6th of the quests currently in the game, I’m eager to check out more.

User [JediMasterx4](https://www.reddit.com/user/JediMasterx4/) seemed [particularly disgruntled](https://www.reddit.com/r/sto/comments/gpyxcm/your_favorite_part_of_the_community/frsanzq?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x):

> You can do all the lockbox promo vids you want, but you are going to have to live in reality, no matter where your ego flies off to.

However, there *were* some positives. User [ModestArk](https://www.reddit.com/user/ModestArk/):

> What I really like about this community is that it seems to be more grown up than other gaming communities. Maybe this comes from Star Trek itself, since it is more based/focused on science than Star Wars etc.

[Jahoan](https://www.reddit.com/user/Jahoan/) recommends [StarSword’s series on the U.S.S. *Bajor*](https://www.fanfiction.net/u/5198322/StarSword-C) and [Jordanomega1](https://www.reddit.com/user/Jordanomega1/) vouched for [Captain Geronimo’s videos](https://www.youtube.com/user/jakovzlatar33).

## State of The Game

This past January, *Star Trek Online: Legacy* was [launched](https://www.arcgames.com/en/games/star-trek-online/news/detail/11357563-star-trek%3A-legacy-now-live!), bringing *The Original Series*-referencing episodes *The Measure of Morality* parts [*I*](https://sto.gamepedia.com/Mission:_The_Measure_of_Morality_(Part_1)) and [*II*](https://sto.gamepedia.com/Mission:_The_Measure_of_Morality_(Part_2)) along with a new [10 year anniversary event](https://sto.gamepedia.com/10_Year_Anniversary_Event) and the [Tier 6 Khitomer Alliance Battlecruiser](https://www.arcgames.com/en/games/star-trek-online/news/detail/11351133-command-the-first-klingon%2Ffederation-ship!) – “the first Klingon/Federation Starship.” I did not participate in the event, save for experiencing the new missions, which I talked about in [my review of *Star Trek: Discovery*](https://bilge.world/star-trek-discovery-review). JustGaming4Us produced an excellent, [in-depth video review](https://youtu.be/KHhakbz6q8s) of the two missions as well as a [tour of the event as a whole](https://youtu.be/M3KJkcCaymA). I, for one, have never been partial to Shiny New Ship gluttony largely because of how long it took me to “master” my own Intrepid-Class Retrofit – christened the U.S.S. *Bataan* after the aircraft carrier my grandfather served on in WWII – as much as I have. It took me years to arrange my bridge officer abilities and their keybinds in such a way that I could maintain a fairly-steady dps rotation and I have no desire to go through the process of learning a new ship again. For most veteran players, however, trying out different ships/skill specs is all there is left to do.

Choosing whether or not – or to whom – to recommend the game is an issue best left to actual gaming journalists. In March, *Massively Overpowered* – the followup project to what was once *Massively.com* – published [Mia DeSanzo’s account](https://massivelyop.com/2020/03/30/mmo-cartographer-boldly-going-into-star-trek-online/) of her first experience in the game:

> Everything you’ve heard is true. Ground combat is, as multiple sources have told me, “a hot mess.” I don’t think clunky is an adequate descriptor. You’d have to try it.

For the same site, [Tyler F.M. Edwards argued](https://massivelyop.com/2020/01/23/why-i-play-is-star-trek-online-worth-playing-in-2020/) in January that *Star Trek Online* is best left to those who already love *Star Trek*:

> STO has some things going for it as a video game, and it’s certainly unique in the MMO space, but it has too many basis quality issues for it to be a game I’d recommend to someone who’s never watched an episode of Star Trek.

Compared to what I experienced all those years ago in Closed and Open Beta, *Star Trek Online* is now *vastly* more polished, but perhaps compared to other MMOs in 2020, it is, indeed, “rough.” In my casual return this past month, I have yet to experience any significant bugs. Considering his character data dates back to launch, I’d like to think that the server is set into some brief, confused panic every time I log in to Kuvak, but perhaps that’s just a fantasy. I have still been enjoying the space combat in the classic Advanced-level [Borg Disconnected](https://www.arcgames.com/en/games/star-trek-online/news/detail/7003293-borg-disconnected) and [Counterpoint](https://www.arcgames.com/en/games/star-trek-online/news/detail/9527023-star-trek-online%3A-counterpoint) TFOs and my first entry into high-level gear upgrade crafting from the vast cache of materials I’ve built up over the years. . Apparently, my old lockbox collection might actually be worth some significant Energy Credits on the Exchange – as of the time of this writing, however, not a one had yet to sell.

If you’re a ship junkie who’s entirely unfamiliar with the property, know that *Star Trek*’s ships are *fucking cute*. The [Nebula Class](https://www.startrek.com/article/inside-the-nebula-class-starship), especially, inspires real affection. In my opinion, it alone is worth giving this free-to-play game a shot. My two point eight pound [Surface Laptop 2](https://extratone.com/microsoft-surface-laptop-2-review-windows-future) is enough to run it fairly well at medium-high settings, which is an absurdly low barrier-to-entry. You shouldn’t be worried about investing your time, either – *Star Trek* doesn’t appear to be dying anytime soon.
