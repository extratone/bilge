Description = Don't know where you're going but want to know where you've been?
Map My Drive is a simple, easy to use GPS tracking application that will plot a route on a map. â€¨Since all the data is stored on your device and is not sent across the internet, you can be sure that it is safe and secure. It is primarily designed to be used for tracking where a car drives, but could be used for other purposes as well such as biking or hiking.
Map your route. Share your route.
You can create multiple routes and have complete control over when you want to start and stop tracking for each route. Also for each route, you can see how far you traveled, how long it took you, see where you stopped and for how long, see what the weather was like along your route, the altitude along the route, and add custom pins to the map that can include images. In addition, Map My Drive can continually track your location (with your consent, of course) in the background freeing you up to use your phone for other purposes.
While tracking your location, you can quickly and easily share where you currently are with any of your friends. 
Using the export options, you can export your route to a KML, GPX, or backup file which can then be shared through any supported installed app. In addition, you can also share a link to your route. Every time you share a link to your map, your route is exported to the cloud and made available for public viewing to anyone with a link. A special link is then generated which will display your route in any web browser making it a perfect way to share your route with your friends and family.
Pro Upgrade:
- Remove Ads
- Generate Directions
- Create and build a route from scratch
- Edit a route
- Share routes with friends and family
Since continued use of any GPS service running in the background can significantly decrease battery life, there is a setting that you can change within the app to help fit your needs and reduce battery usage.
