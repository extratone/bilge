# Not missing the home button as much as I expected to
OK so I talk to my face right now on adapting to the lack of a home button you know I think a big thing is like I just never held one I know you are you even when I was like the least interested in phone technology which I wanted is. It was like 2014 2015 I think it was around the time when I was an experience life before that I broke my iPhone and my mom was like no more like here it's you have a job it's your turn to get your own phone now and I was like I have like 15 fucking dollars So I went in my carrier I think it was AT&T again back then and I was like what's the cheapest phone and they were like we have one for free I just T9 so that's the phone I had for a little while that's another topic I guess but I am already. Why am I losing my front of our Jesus how do I get there a home but oh I I was saying even during that time when the new iPhones came out I still made a point to go into the store and hold them and try them right I still watch I watch all Keynote slide I think at least I watch I've definitely watch through all of them at least once even when I did not give a shit about Apple it's still a thing that I have because it's been a part of my life since I was in him But I didn't do that for the iPhone X am I didn't actually sit down and watch any of my friends that have these phones and like watch how they use them so literally I and I did not think that I was going to be getting it all again it's not a rational decision for me to get us it's just something I had to do so I didn't get out To deal with it anytime soon so I was like OK we're going to be getting new phones oh shit how do they how did they replace the home button and swipe up and I mean what are you how is it so far they did an excellent excellent job so far it's really changed my use in there OK how many millions of times have I double click the home button to get in the multitasking you to our switch got one of the most asking about iPhone 4 I think right 10 years basically I've been doing that it's just been a part of my speedy iPhone use that impresses other people and they watch me she's my phone And I haven't been switching to have to do that whatever you have to like slowly scroll up it it really I mean obviously it's ingenious right obviously I figure this out but also for what nine years or something I have no control centers around I've been swiping up to get to the control center and I have to swipe down this is like I don't know my iPhone muscle memory is not what are used to be for one thing because I just don't I'm just not mobile so it's helped kind of learning but I think what I was saying originally is that I just don't use the multitasking you as much as I found myself searching for the app and Dragons versus fast faster but I don't I don't I miss it yeah I was gonna say it's a little awkward a hold on the side button for your theory but fry I've been exploring many as the ad seems that they made a horrible figure of all I have gone through my really I just been like holy shit there's a lot haven't comprehend at all yet I don't is it really any more awkward than holding a home button was thinking back on that I mean there is an iPhone It was so unusual and yes it was revolutionary that complaining now that now in retrospect the complaining about this alteration just seems erotic because I had to get used to that because I was 14 and now I'm 86 and getting old yeah I'm home but yeah
