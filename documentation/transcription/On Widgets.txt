> A major realization I had lately is that, after months of experiments, I don't really enjoy using iOS 14 widgets on my Home Screen.

Widgets oh boy or a girl funny Federico of a teacher who's like is the dean founded Mac stories is the guy that writes like an e-book for every big iOS release him I just subscribed MacStories or something I wanted to do for a long time and now I feel just fine at least for a while oh man it's great do that their weekly round it is beautiful definitely worth money anyway I said something on a podcast recently that I realized you like weird realization at the same time and I don't wanna put words in his mouth Basically he was like you know I realize that I just don't like widgets I know I like fundamentally don't like what it is his thing is especially like he hates that there's like basically Widgets open the host app with all that if you tap on them But I get that there are exceptions for us Drafts actually But for me I guess You know I will persevere and try to play around with it sent an extra mission right up front that the flicker of the big flicker Widget is like genuinely one of the biggest sources of joy Her in my life that because it's just I'm so glad that I put that on my third home screen Every time I scroll over to have a swipe past my home screen there's a beautiful image Flickr widget And what are usually do if I see a beautiful if it is there is a tap on it which opens it in the Flickr app and then I like that image and I hit the share sheet throw down and if the person you know I'm flicker really down I don't know if You can look at the person can choose to make all like make the image downloadable in and it's original format where they can choose to not and if it is down a little bit original format that in the share sheet the app Lists a State Amit Draft and if it isn't it doesn't so that's why check it and then if it is if it's there I usually say that image You can find a lot of those in the wallpaper Share iCLoud of Folder which I going to wear anyway And my mom said something really profound in reaction to which it but I thought I wanted to share I think the question of our age so my mom is seven years old she runs her own private practice from home I help her out with stuff but like you know it's it's finally life she said everything up she uses her iPhone her and her MacBook for everything but it rifles very important services because it's basically it most of it is scheduling and texting people And she runs her entire business on a regular old iCloud calendar which used to make me nervous I'm actually going to realize now that's literally the best option considering that all of my calendars are I'm having another calendar membership as fears anyway so I We can a half ago we scheduled time for me to sit down and remove all the apps from her phone that she had never used and I try out different organizations of her home screen And I hope I was like you know what let's try putting a big calendar with it of course she wasn't really paying attention to be talking about all this so I just was kind of doing it and like the stuff that actually was consequential and make sure that she was paying attention to me is like can I delete the fucking panda up Panera bread app But I don't think she's paying extra for it like you know I wouldn't be either what I was like I'm gonna put a calendar event anyway so the day before yesterday she was like hey can you come Can you make us go away what she said specifically she's like I don't want that I want a small one and it first I thought she was talking about the small Widget so I changed the small as she's like no no no I'm here I just want the small one I just I don't want to I can just open it and I was just talking about the app I got a like And she was like why would I question was the profound question and I get it to is she's like why would I look at that when I could just open it why would I look at the calendar with it when I could just open the app and that's that's just what I'm getting she was like If you're like running a dual display desktop set up and you want to put a Widget that like I get yeah they're a calendar wish it makes sense maybe just go to the scope of your day but like That's just one it is distinctly only makes sense on desktop really am Because like I don't know it's so it is what are the consequences like what's wrong with just opening me up Another's reasoning but like I just thought that was insightful that she said that OK I realize that I'm on fundamentally doesn't languages so The three of us Federico myself my mom also if I really don't like witches and I get like that flicker which I want everyone to try the app itself could use a lot of work is definitely not the full Flicker or Experience But Yeah that there which it is and it's very simple it just pulls it as far as I know I just pulled from the explore it like randomly But yeah that's that's all I can think of and no I would not want it it's like the perfect Timed image retrieval it I'm talking about like I don't like that feature on windows or you can send it to you know every day randomly selected as a background because there's no way for me to opt him away from the say OK and like see a preview the image for us and like the flavor which is the perfect Implementation of that because her like half the time I seen a wish I was still in I'll be like oh that's nice I'm not like I have to make it then I'll get on my wallpaper collection immediately But when I do want it really just takes me a few seconds Widgets I just I guess OK they're in the widget that's useful I have the same thing with a shortcut The shortest like the T-shirts that I use the most are the shortcut that disables Bluetooth and Wi-Fi And by far that's the most my most you sure can always has been And a shortcut that toggles the accessibility button so that I can reset my iPhones ram before opening a game So It's all yeah those are displayed in a short cuts Widget on my butt home screen I can't see the screen is still at the house finish really know that's called by them Other exception is like the carrot weather apps which is very beautiful as most of the app you now I don't know I don't really get it it was validating through the Federico multiple Federico being the most I was person it is his primary computer for the past seven years it's been an iPad and it was a big deal they ran a build me a company on that so Validating fuck him fuck widgets man
