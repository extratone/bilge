# Critic Markup Extension #

*Version 1.0 15 Apr 2013*

This is extension for using [Critic Markup](http://criticmarkup.com) syntax in multimarkdown documents.

## Usage ##

If you edit someone's documents, use one of four critical marks:

- **addition**
- **deletion**
- **text substitution**
- **highlight part of the text for comment**

Each selected mark may be accepted or rejected using System Services. If you don't have them in your OS download [Critical Markup Toolbox](https://github.com/CriticMarkup/CriticMarkup-toolkit/archive/master.zip)
and put available Services inside your `~/Library/Services` directory.


## To-Do ##

- [ ] Rewrite System Services for accepting and rejecting critic marks
- [ ] Add actions for accepting/rejecting marks in whole document at once
- [X] Actions should not appear in Firefox,Opera and Chrome
