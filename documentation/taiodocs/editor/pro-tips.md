# Toolbar

**Markdown** is a lightweight markup language with plaintext formatting syntax, it could be written using any editor, but having a powerful toolbar can still significantly improve your productivity.

Taio's toolbar is designed for this purpose, it supports most of commonly used Markdown syntaxes, which can reduce your typing costs.

Sometimes, you need to select text before applying a format. For example, the "B" button can toggle `Bold` or `Normal` style for the selected text.

However, for formats like `Heading` and `Lists`, you don't need to select the corresponding line.

# Writing Experience

Taio does tons of work to make writing easy, intelligent. Some examples:

- You can edit and preview multiple files at the same time
- Headings can be navigated by using the outline view
- Task states can be toggle using toolbar
- List items can be automatically added by adding a new line
- The editor can highlight bracket pairs

There are many other improvements, we encourage you to check it out.

# Text Snippets

Taio offers a way more powerful snippets support for dynamic content than the built-in text replacement feature in iOS. For example, you can dynamically enter the current date, time, or clipboard content.

Text snippets are highly customizable, and we are adding keyboard shortcuts to make it better.

# Workflow

Taio has a powerful action system, you can create your own workflows. If you are already a "Shortcuts" user, you will be familiar with how it works, workflow system in Taio is the "Shortcuts" designed particularly for text editing.

To make it easy for you to get started, we've prepared some examples that you can refer to build your own library of actions.

If built-in actions are not sufficient enough, you can leverage JavaScript for scripting, Taio fully supports [JSBox](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/id1312014438) scripts.

# Gestures

Taio's editor offers convenient gestures, such as:

- Pinch to zoom in and zoom out
- Swipe left or right to change the cursor position
- Triple tap to select the current line

These operations can also be accomplished in other ways, but the proper use of gestures can significantly improve efficiency.

Taio is still in a very early stage, we have many ongoing and planned improvements.
