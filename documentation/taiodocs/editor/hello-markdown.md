# Hello, Markdown

Markdown is a popular format for writing documents, aims to achieve common formats using simple syntax.

Instead of explaining everything, which makes beginners scared, this doc wanted to show you commonly used features in 5 minutes.

# Heading level 1

## Heading level 2

### Heading level 3

As you can see, headings start with # sign, from level 1 to level 6.

# Text Formats

Standard Markdown supports **Bold** and *Italic* text, some implementations support ~~strikethrough~~. We need to embed HTML for underline text, such as <u>this</u>.

# Lists

Use numbers and minus sign for ordered list and unordered list:

1. First
2. Second

- Taio
- JSBox

Also, Taio supports checklists like this:

- [ ] Unchecked
- [x] Checked

# Links and Images

Links are supported by adding brackets like this:

[Taio Website](https://taio.app)

Images are similar, just add an exclamation mark before it.

# Preview

Markdown can be previewed as HTML, please try it out by tapping the "eye" button.
