These provisions notwithstanding, the administration of the service reserves the right to revoke any user's access permissions, at any time, for any reason, except as limited by law.

## Cross-posting

"Cross-posting" is the automatic copying of posts from one platform to another. That definition does **not** include the simultaneous posting to multiple platforms from the same app, such as Twidere or PostyBirb. If you use those apps, we consider those posts original, and the following need not apply.

Cross-posting from Mastodon to other platforms is fully permitted. **Cross-posting into Mastodon from another platform is permitted under the following terms:**

1.  The posts do not include platform-specific references, e.g. talking about "here" meaning Twitter, or including text from other non-Mastodon users verbatim (e.g. cross-posted quote tweets)
2.  The account is at least semi-regularly monitored by the author, so that interactions from Mastodon users are not ignored
3.  The account being cross-posted is owned by the same person. Third-party copying of content is not permitted
