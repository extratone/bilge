# ⸎ Personal Styleguide ⸎

*Right now, this is more or less just a lazy export of [the project I started on Notion](https://www.notion.so/rotund/Personal-Styleguide-0cc224ece87d4517985ab185fb145161). Not sure where it's going in the future.*

## David Blue's personal style guide across writing, social posts, etc.

In a desire to quantify/document my own personal preferences in composition, I have contemplated writing a style guide like this for a very long time.

**The English language is no more than a tool for our use', and grammar should not be revered as an immalleable, Holy absolute which we must venerate and obey. Rather, it should be irreverently and liberally manipulated to perform as desired.**

## Style

⸎ Footnotes and Endnotes come *after* both **punctuation** *and* **quotation marks**.

## Spelling

- ⸎ "WiFi"

- “sortof”

- “featureset”

- “Web Site”


## Avoid

- "I'd be *remiss*..."
- "Really *struck* me."
- "At the end of the day..."
- "When it's all said and done..."
- "In the final hour..."
- "Out of all the __, __ really stood out to me..."
- "In my book..."
- "In my estimation..."
- **All idioms**.
- **All platitudes**.
- The “tldr” school of thought.

## Scribam Quid Non Legerim *I will write what I have not read.*

> As an independent, youth-oriented publication it is both our privilege and our duty to seek out innovative methods of communication. In written composition, this means all possible avoidance of unnecessary cliche and/or overused terms (for instance: use of the term “struck” in a metaphor - e.g. what **struck** me) except where they are critically portrayed. It is essential to remember that **the English language is no more than a tool for our use', and grammar should not be revered as an immalleable, Holy absolute which we must venerate and obey. Rather, it should be irreverently and liberally manipulated to perform as desired.** Grammar should never be an obstacle **or burden '**in our writing or editing, and should always be discarded in favor of innovative and/or contextual verse.

> In general, we write, speak, and publish under the assumption of an intelligent, discerning audience, meaning that we are unafraid of traversing obscure, unusual, or extraordinary detail (technical or otherwise,) that we do not patronize beyond the reasonable ability of a modern reader’s search engine, and especially that **we format copy independently of common web standard “readability**.**”** Our vocabulary and syntax are diverse (though we do not sacrifice undue time to unearthing bizarre, senseless synonyms,) fluid, and occasionally difficult, but written as such for the purpose of colorful, substantial delivery in acknowledgement of the vast resources instantly available to the modern reader. In other words: do not tell what can simply and easily be looked up. With search engines as they are, this is a quickly verifiable/quantifiable factor with a given definition, summary, or abstract. If a writer is in conflict regarding the redundancy of a given bit of information, they can painlessly search for it themselves and observe the same results as the reader would within milliseconds to observe what would and would not be immediately evident. Not only is this approach respectful of the readership’s intellect, it is also a comparatively democratic means of regarding information.

> I want to be deafened by the penultimate death rattle of a circuit bent sacrificial ritual and indiscriminately punched in the throat at a First Friday show.

**Here’s what I know**: the worthwhile publications have *not* been crucified on the Cross of “Readability,” the genre-busting song talent has *not* been given up in the face of the streaming service-afflicted music industry.
