## This is an excerpt with commentary from a guest presentation during the iPad Pro unveiling at Apple's Fall 2015 special event.

It was, indeed, a relatively important one, as arguably the definitive moment leading to the relationship between Apple, Inc. and Microsoft constructing the context that makes first watch so crass.
