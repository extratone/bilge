# Bilge 3.1 Release Notes

Howdy Writeas/WriteFreely people! 

In this release, I hope I have finally delivered a fairly-polished, relatively thoroughly-tested, and _even somewhat intuitively personalizable_ style configuration for you! 

I'm going to (at least this once) be excruciatingly thorough in my presentation of what changes I've decided worth this release, why I set about modifying them, and precisely how they were implemented.

Largely to demonstrate in-depth CSS configuration within our particular/somewhat niche CMS environment in a visual/semi-chronological medium.

## Changes
* #49 - Added a super-cropped, sortolf web-optimized capture of @taroyabuki's [single-page Unicode project](https://github.com/taroyabuki/onepage-unicode-chars).
* #61 - With Write.as's addition of [Rich Media Embed support](https://discuss.write.as/t/rich-media-embeds/2425) via Embedly, I originally started this Issue with the intention of going back through *the entire* *Psalms* archive and converting every supported HTML embed into the raw URL of the targets. I made some significant progress, but ultimately decided to use my time doing something else and wait to apply this treatment to older posts until/unless I have another reason to edit a given post in the future. To track the state of embeds on Writeas, going forward, see: [the embedas repo](https://github.com/embedas/go-embed), [the Gist I created](https://gist.github.com/extratone/750847103dd5cd9da52fbd51b1c2e378) (and will do my best to keep regularly updated) and *The Psalms*' updated [public test page](https://bilgel.world/test).
* #24 - The Hypothes.is sidebar was being a pain in the ass because I accidentally configured it to expand immediately upon anyone landing on the page... That's been resolved.
* #54 - Added CSS for code blocks including syntax highlighting. Here's how it should look:

* #39 - Added CSS for Tables as well. (Not quite satisfied with the look but it's certainly better than it was.)

* #125 - Added CSS for GitHub Gists since they are explicitly supported by the new media embed integration. *Definitely* have more to do, but the result should suffice for a while.

**For the next release**, I *really will* take care of #52 Footnotes... But it's going to be a hot minute.
