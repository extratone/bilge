WITNESS: I demonstrate the successful authentication of the account we created for Chet Munch in the last video with every single Mastodon app on the App Store in less than 12 minutes on my iPhone 12 Pro Max, using my own two fingers.

714 seconds / 20 apps = 35.7 seconds/app login rate. This is actually fairly high considering I basically could not read text whatsoever.

My friend, I do not condescend - it wasn't until recently that I realized Mastodon only feels complex because it was actually just designed to give you as much power over your social media participation/consumption as reasonably possible. It's not a platitude, nor a manifesto (for all of us, anyway, but it has definitely resulted in THE most thoughtful, original, and ingenious social software I have ever seen.

My full adventure through the lot of available Mastodon apps for iOS is coming very, very soon to: https://bilge.world 

I'd very much appreciate your attention/collaboration/celebration of the GitHub List I created for this project: https://github.com/extratone/FediiOS

To the developers, 𝐭𝐡𝐚𝐧𝐤 𝐲𝐨𝐮 𝐟𝐨𝐫 𝐩𝐮𝐭𝐭𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐬𝐨 𝐦𝐮𝐜𝐡 𝐨𝐟 𝐲𝐨𝐮𝐫𝐬𝐞𝐥𝐯𝐞𝐬 𝐢𝐧𝐭𝐨 𝐭𝐡𝐞𝐬𝐞 𝐛𝐞𝐚𝐮𝐭𝐢𝐟𝐮𝐥 𝐥𝐢𝐭𝐭𝐥𝐞 𝐞𝐱𝐩𝐞𝐫𝐢𝐞𝐧𝐜𝐞𝐬. I very much hope my upcoming celebration of them will feel welcome.
