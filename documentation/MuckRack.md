# MuckRack Bio

David Blue began producing films about cars in high school and wrote a weekly column for [*Speedmonkey*](http://speedmonkey.co.uk) through community college.

He hosted a music, technology, and automotive podcast throughout 2015 called [*Drycast*](http://extratone.com/drycast), before going on to launch [*Extratone*](http://extratone.com/about) in the Spring of 2016 as an independent online magazine in the interest of consolidating and unifying the vast amount of original voices heâ€™d discovered within his network of artists, musicians, culture writers, and graphic designers, and continues to pursue new culture and new perspectives.
