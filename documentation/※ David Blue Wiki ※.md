# ※ David Blue Wiki ※

*Right now, this is more or less just a lazy export of [the project I started on Notion](https://www.notion.so/rotund/David-Blue-Wiki-53faa1dcb32b49519e95526d88538d1f). Not sure where it's going in the future.*

This space is my best attempt (at the moment) at creating a Digital Garden/personal wiki more or less as I was introduced to the concept by [Tom Critchlow](https://tomcritchlow.com/blogchains/digital-gardens/). It also serves as a home/index page for all of my public Notion workspaces. At the moment, it is almost entirely unorganized and not even entirely contained within this space. I expect refinement will come as I grow more familiar with how Notion works. I would eventually like to make it *look pretty* (for lack of a better term) like [(@)_ariesaa's popular template on #notiontwt](https://twitter.com/_ariesaa/status/1306192609623195653).
