<p>The social network Periscope is going to officially be dead in precisely one week, so I thought I might share what I would estimate to be the absolute best example of my hundreds of improvised broadcasts over the ~6 years we had with it.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the original audio was recorded with an iPhone 6 Plus&#39; microphone at a sub-optimal distance from my Yamaha digital keyboard before being <em>further</em> compressed to stream live on Periscope, and <em>then likely compressed further still</em> when I redownloaded it  recently.</p>
