Well... I'm gonna start adding guests, obnoxiously, but ... only people that look white... cuz I don't...

Oh God! That sounds awful.



---

i am live
haps
you're dangerous still
um
it's sort of
weird because
oh man i didn't realize that there was a
pun to haphazard [ __ ]
um
let's see if i can
wow wow
as
uh
i guess i didn't i didn't
that's cool cleaned up a little bit
definitely
can i just invite everybody i'm pretty
sure i can do that
i'm not any cleaner than i was last time
i did this
um oh yeah what i was saying
i keep talking about like in the past
tense being like
yo there used to be these extremely
powerful tools that like tweetdeck
where you could post to like 15
different social accounts from one
compo compose window from one post uh
and i think last time
i definitely spent a lot of time talking
about that
because um
like i can't think of anything i cannot
think of any
more honestly more difficult prospect
going into the social
the consumer social media space
than being like yo we're gonna launch
a service that integrates
across all the live streaming
options that a person might have
works uh
like i don't know how they did it i'm
kind of curious
uh and i get more curious like the more
times that i come in here and see that
it's still going
i don't understand the marketing stuff
[ __ ] that wasn't that accidental
um
[Music]
and i should just
try
uh the chat and see if the chat
integrates
brilliant writer
it's supposed to integrate with uh
with youtube right
oops i do not know how to use the
television
i think i'm supposed to be able to uh
how do i use the chat
with the mic maybe
on this television
i'm upset with myself
on the tv it's a tuesday
morning and i need the job
oh my god there's the n-word
what
[Applause]
my friend my friend there is no choice
your looks totally match
that pretty voice
what on god's green earth was that
i hope the n word doesn't pop up again
but one more time
i would like to speak in the chat
chat
[ __ ]
what do i do with my life yo
i guess we move around why is there a
dollar cat though
i guess i should be looking at the um
the actual hats page
from another
uh device i've got one
but there's something i uh oh yeah
i wanted to turn off the lights
um i'm gonna hide comments for a second
and
wow i can literally invite i can invite
a lot of people
what happens if uh
oh is that is that actually a static
focus window
here's something absurd i'm going to use
dictation
that wasn't even right length [ __ ]
[Music]
i'm using all of the technologies that i
don't use
well this is fun
in that uh i know that it's probably on
my
discord profile
but i have no idea
what's being shown
where's the little one buddy
[Music]
puppy
oh you're there i'm sorry
i just want to make sure you're okay
everything's fine so the viewer count in
the upper left
has now reached six
same
if i do this
sucks
well i'm gonna start adding guests
obnoxiously but
only people that look white
because i don't
god that sounds awful okay the reason i
said that is not because i only want
white people in here it's because i
don't
want no i can't i can't do that
that's a bad idea isn't it because i
don't i
didn't want to be disruptive to
the lives of anyone of color and this is
a very disrupt that would be a
disruptive thing that wouldn't add any
value to their lives
that requires some explanation
uh
yeah i guess the the answer is that i
really am more or less unwilling
to uh add to the disruption
they're just like there are consequent
like theoretically
there could be consequences now i'm
conscious of it
uh i my whole adolescent [ __ ] was
like
um there really weren't
any realistic consequences from
inviting everyone with a names on a
given app
to my broadcast especially of this size
because that wasn't very many people
um
i am very curious
my machine
ugh oh yeah
well
definitely a lot less people here now
what
now i'm joining the broadcast on my
laptop what
hey this isn't too bad
definitely not going to be enough
lighting but whatever
oh nice
why are you washing your feet on scope
that's a great question
okay
hmm
i don't know what this looks like so
no so
it that was a stupid thing to say what i
meant was
i am i thought i was willing to like
invite
random white people in because i'm
willing to disrupt random
white people's lives but having
like uh
maybe that isn't i don't know maybe that
uh
level of because i am just [ __ ]
around
that's the thing
i guess it probably seems really
condescending or something
i don't know man
the uh extent to which the origin
of uh
my heritage
is just stealing from people
which is theft and exploitation
uh in extremely intricate ways
uh
i don't know i just don't
i've definitely what i should just do is
i shouldn't do that
i shouldn't invite random people that
being said
did that invite you
you look dumb
yeah did it put me on the on the hot
tubbing
twitch [ __ ] what's up man
okay hey
if the audio is going to come out of
there
no i shouldn't even try i should
this is they've really worked on this
um
yes
yo what's up cutie
hey man
that uh
out of all the stupid things that i've
said
how do i sorry i'm trying to figure out
how to like
leave i have two devices i just wanna
no there we go
um
so the exp the uh it was not refusing to
allow black people it was refusing
to randomly invite
people and i was thinking out loud oh
hey man
yo what what happened
um i don't know
because like the idea that
uh anyone is watching or engaging
or it's time
well that's
how do i join i'm not sure
um
[Music]
how many times let's see black lives do
matter
uh honestly so the reason why i'm almost
tempted to end the broadcast because
it's like so here's the explanation
i was thinking out loud and i was like
hey i should just start inviting random
people
with the letter like with names starting
with the letter a
and then i was like looking down the
list and i was like but i don't want to
like invite
people who i would like actually disrupt
their lives
um that was my thought process
uh what's interesting
and like now that i i feel like me
explaining it is just taking more of
your time
and wasting more of your time so i think
that
i'm gonna end it but
um i am at neoyoco on twitter i'm not
promoting myself
i'm still i am uh very
accessible uh if you'd like to come
to ride me and i'm enjoying this i'm
enjoying this stream
a lot please don't end it well i'm
worried because
i don't see any twitter notifications on
my own account
um i don't oh thomas candice join i i
don't hear him though
sorry i don't know how haps works i
literally only came on here because i
wanted to [ __ ] around on it
and it occurred to me that i should
start oh [ __ ] really
yo what's up david hey
dude what's your thoughts on blm bro you
[ __ ] with it or not
um you could say you can say that
[Music]
i mean
black lives matter uh black lives
black time matters and i i'm worried
about
so so uh my time doesn't matter is what
you're saying
i don't know i don't know who you are
but uh
thomas candice you don't know who thomas
candace is
um not yet well you should learn you
should learn
what did you mean by black yeah what's a
black tom
okay
so like i don't wanna i i don't wanna
wait uh anyone but white people's time
and i don't
i don't even know if i'd be willing to
waste
that i like the cheering noise oh
sorry okay if i'm gonna continue this
you have to tell me where you found it
and
on what i found what this broadcast
on twitch yeah you're streaming on
twitch
yeah and who it was that said that i
said that'll allow you black people in
here you did you literally
you did you said no i mean
so you were watching when i said that
yeah well no yeah
yeah okay we'll clip it
um well then yeah as long as i just was
worried that like
someone was like this
uh this dude is
you know statement blue save the blue
um this app is so disruptive i'm
simultaneously
interesting streaming on facebook and
twitch oh you're on facebook too
hi mom i'm huge hi mom
hi dad i made it off to facebook hello
one
sixth of the human race
species you just assume my gender
speaking just really quietly
[Music]
oh my bad my dog was chewing on my nuts
again
just sign in
it should so david how's your how's your
day going
well i uh i thought
i was very proactive about microsoft
build which is like their
their event you know yeah i've heard
about it i've heard about it
um i'm like uh
i don't know top three obsessions in
life is microsoft word specifically
um so i always sign up for these things
whenever i'm allowed to
and whenever they do it for free
mostly so that i can go in and be like
hey you should fix
anything i feel like that much people
don't use the word though you know
[Music]
that's the thing is a lot of people do
use word
[ __ ] nerds what's
like uh
it's still the industry standard
[Music]
what do you use what is superior to word
um
i mean i feel like language you know
other than my words my language
like so you're post word processing then
yeah yeah and you consider verbal
communication
not to be the predecessor but
the uh the evolution
of the written word sure yeah
well you might be happy to know that
then that 45 million
american adults cannot functionally read
and write
idiots really and it's not because
they're idiots it's because their
education system has failed them
yep it's uh the number used to be 10
about 10 and it's somehow [ __ ]
growing how come
that's a good question um
i'm just now like i feel like my ability
to actually be of use to people
uh
i'm like basically at a kindergarten
level
in that regard you said you're
kindergartener or do they go level
yeah and what and what stance
i mean if like
um in terms of being any use to anyone
oh maddie 2012
speaking to us from the past
hello illinois hello illinois

now
um what do i do
you have a job like what do you do for
fun okay nevermind
i don't enjoy anything
you don't enjoy anything what about i
thought you liked microsoft word
okay that's that's a that's a good
question i guess
or what's in the question well your
original
question of like what do i what do i do

what's up
[Laughter]
why you drinking so much beer [ __ ]
[ __ ] [ __ ] [ __ ] [ __ ] [ __ ] [ __ ] i'll
drink me i drink
hmm
sorry oh
i can't hate that
i never have to remove people from
anything
it's always that compulsion
we're like why okay
here's my thing uh
when i got into rap along with my white
friends we got into backpacker rap when
i was in high school
um i think i
was they have the explanation i can say
the n word uh
around other white people and when i'm
rap
know what what i'm rapping
uh and that's okay
and then um
it was one explanation
uh hang on just a second
that my friend told me one time that
like
uh give me just a moment give me 45
seconds
my friend was like hey man just because
you don't think
that word could have power writing etc
etc
it just means that you don't understand
the concept of harm
in the privileged conversation some for
some reason the way you worded that
uh
[Applause]
[Music]
there's so many things that you play
um
basically i was like oh [ __ ]
uh and it's really not that hard to just
um not allow yourself to say it in your
own mind and oh yeah
he was like just like that's not your
word and i was like
holy [ __ ] so
um hang on let me sit in the tub okay i
haven't sat down on the tub and i know
i'm slow
i'm really thirsty uh
i'll sit down the tub and tell you the
rules
[Music]
oh
um so my only like my moderation
rules are this you can be you basically
say whatever you want i guess
including um
i guess including why people are saying
i don't want to hear it uh why people
send me onward
it's an aesthetic choice
uh you owe it so you can be as dirty as
you want you can be
as threatening as you want but only
toward me
not for other users uh
not directly toward any other people
adjacent to you um
i'm going with the rules uh yeah
i've never so for some reason people
don't i say that and to me it just seems
really simple
like
please don't make me use this app's
moderation tools because they suck okay
hi puppy squeezy puppy
um
so you can be disruptive for the sake of
being disruptive
but let's not be racist
unless it's for me
it's a different sort of thing uh if
you'd like to
again attack anything let me look
i guess i should give you some
vulnerabilities it's not fair
if you don't know me
i would say okay my eyes do this
they're like i'm like cross-eyed
in theory i'm uh
self-conscious about that
oh what others what are some other soft
spots
um
well
all right
i guess i will take questions
uh if there's anything anyone wants to
know syntax wise how to accomplish in
powershell
um
hmm i've already invited you
i feel like i've been to joliet illinois
yo what's up dude i'm back i i miss you
and what part of illinois is that
uh yeah facts
oh okay it's it's probably like i don't
know it was like an hour from chicago
where is it in relation to lincoln uh
[ __ ] um i don't know like an hour ish
away
oh directions huh i think it's i think
it's to the south
what's up i'm back good morning good
morning
it's morning where you're at it's um
i got tired of being wrong about what
time it was uh
when i was about 12 or so because people
would really attack me because i just
didn't know
so i just decided uh to i'll just say
good morning
all the time so even when it's like
in like the middle of the night you're
just like
morning morning
in fact it's generally my like if you go
uh if you get to really
obsessed with me and you're like i'm
already obsessed with you
yeah um well you'll find the word good
morning
uh i've used it to use that joke a lot
it's not even
i do actually have one joke that i
authored in my lifetime
um can you tell me a joke
well it would be that one joke right
but i feel like since there is only one
we should save it
uh anyway
is there anything you would like to know
how to do in in powershell
well no not not really
[ __ ] i just wouldn't explain
like just tell me the general idea of it
like what would you say like the overlay
of it is
steps oh [ __ ] oh my god read that whole
book to me please
have you ever run a command in a command
line before
well no i have it unfortunately
wow i'm sorry i'm sorry if i don't meet
you
i can't what [ __ ] do
honed
i can't believe i spent
50 on this book and i can't stand
looking at it
wait sorry what
nothing um
i think i should start reading from the
book
hmm can you start reading me
a bedtime story yeah it's almost
i'm also not bringing a storytelling uh
although
i will tell you one if you'd like
i would love to hear a story from you
david blue
the freelance writer okay
it's an important one okay i'm listening
we're both listening
it's almost topical so once upon a time
uh human beings
figured out well actually
some some [ __ ] crazy insane human
beings in in the
like late 19th century to the
1940s somehow
got paid to spend a lot of time thinking
about something
that was more theoretical than [ __ ]
algebra even
[ __ ] algebra thinking about how they
could
create a system where they could [ __ ]
[ __ ]
they used binary bits
uh in an on absolute reality
okay then you skip that's uh
they made computers oh interesting oh
i'm on a computer right now wow
wait what wait oh wait never mind just
go on
so there and uh there are two parts
really two computers there is the
non-theoretical part
uh then that's the physical bit
that's the the cellular telephone
yeah uh and then there's the part that
doesn't actually exist
uh that is sort of manifested
uh in a way that we can perceive that's
called software
um and software was very proprietary
in the beginning by that i mean at t
uh developed their own way to talk to a
computer
and they like hoarded it and they didn't
let anybody's
uh [ __ ] move actually no
18t i guess this it was okay ibm is the
antagonist of the string
ibm became like the big uh
they were called big blue they were the
uh big blue balls
right they were the original villain
okay so this
i was gonna write an academic essay
about facebook being the villain of our
time and call it like refer to them as
big blue
ha uh well because facebook's blue
well actually and they called the app
internally the big blue app
um i think it's all a cabal that is
about twice like twitter's pretty blue
and big
no no anyway
um i'm sorry
and ibm was like holy [ __ ] we can make
so much money
uh with they like spent uh
they paid thousands and thousands of
people to write
this system uh called dogs and iterate
on it
and it was a way of interacting with the
computer and they're like um we can make
the thing that
we can make the computers and we can
make the software
and we can make it so that
our software only runs software made by
us or people we approve
because otherwise because the other
software
uh it's not that they don't know the
language but they're not allowed to
speak it by law
because ibm oh here's the leveraged
i use the word uh intellectual property
law
that existed for physical
tangible work
i'm not very good at telling the story
anymore
but our hero came along
yeah our hero being uh
an idea a very vague one actually three
guys that were working at texas
instruments
remember your ti 84 oh wait you're still
in school
um uh oh silly
it's important to note the original
silicon valley the original
uh mecca of computers was houston texas
it's called the silicon prairie um it
will return there one day
even if i have to die trying but uh
these three guys at texas instruments
um big texting with texan accents
but they're [ __ ] nerds okay and
they're uh one of them his name is rod
canyon
he's like six foot five played football
huge broad
shoulders uh texas accent his name is
rod
but he's a [ __ ] uh the dorks
basically
in the 80s and they make they
even though they uh all three of them
had
actually kind of gone through the the
period of their lives where they had to
or the industry where they had to work
for just do the grunt work you know the
simple work
they had all achieved management
positions in texas instruments which
was a very respectable company
uh and this is like in chapter exodus of
computers as a whole
right uh and they
all somehow these three otherwise very
rational dudes
were like hey you know what we should do
we just uh
had children a few years ago and we uh
like we got the cushy jobs we're good at
them and we get to sit here
you know we should do we should all
[ __ ] leave to start a company
um and they had uh
they didn't even know what they wanted
the company to be
uh and that company would end up
becoming the fastest growing company in
the history of
this thing that we call or that we this
this uh fantasy that we're living in
called capitalism
um it's called compaq and
um yeah they were like we
we just want to build a computer and we
want it to be open
they through
uh literally what i would call
bootlegging
by copying or uh
maybe not copying that one person
oh have any of you seen halton catch
fire
television it's probably before you were
born
2017. wait wait how old are you
um i'm 27. you're 20 oh
holy [ __ ] are you straight bro what
unfortunately yeah um
to be honest uh my sexuality just kind
of fell off
anyway kind of relate so
um there's so many like spectacular
things about this story
but basically uh yeah i'm so bad at
telling bedtime stories
basically these three texans built a a
company that [ __ ] grew
so fast uh and they uh
so like almost accidentally ended up
paving the way
for all software ever to like the fact
that
i can run this app called haps um
on a f operating system
made by apple on a phone made by apple
um and the fact that apple actually
intended to set up a market where apps
that they didn't make
could be used on their phone with that
whole idea that's all because of
compact computers um
i really want to talk to rod canyon
before i die or before
well before either of us died i suppose
but
it's the same that element that i was
talking about that i got misunderstood
about
earlier i don't want to bother him
anyway do you have a joke powershell
oh you're still on that okay
um i don't know like
i okay [ __ ] i actually do have stuff
to do today are you about to end
streaming
i don't know that oh i literally have
uh so little self-discipline
that i can't give you a certain answer
that question i might just [ __ ] end
it
whoa whoa whoa whoa it's not worth it
anyway
this is um
wait could you tell us a joke
i remember i only have one right yeah

telling
was that the story it's a long ass joke

difference there's a lot of the primary
subject
you're like johnny sins if you know that
is you could be an
astronaut
slow motion yeah i feel like an
astronaut in the ocean

there
what wait what do you mean bro what are
you talking about
all right all right as a porn actor
would you [ __ ] somebody else then
only if it's a dude right would

they're live
um how long is your dick
um okay the only answer to that question
that any man should ever give

you're like asexual
did it fall into your ass like and
you're just like do you not want to [ __ ]

if that were true then you would uh
the right thing is kind of hot look at
poops beeping
carrying around this tripod that i can't
sit down with one hand
so wait like you're just your sexual sex
sexuality fell off uh-huh you say did it
fall down like did the age fall down no

not understanding here
imagine if you know you know there is
like your intellectual concept of sex
right yeah
dude can we kick maddie 2012. he's just
streaming racist stuff
he's streaming hitler stuff man this is
real like oh yeah
i mean that's [ __ ] go back to 2012 okay
okay okay wait explain explain now let
me explain
so go ahead you're like there's nobody
that you know that's like an
intellectual concept and then there's
the bit where like
you're just walking around all of a
sudden you see a
an attractive young woman and you're
just your body
feels so young
and i i gotta i gotta continue my
species okay there's there's a thing
that you can't control
wait how young though
so what are you saying
but like how young no so what you're
saying is like
it got to the point where you looked at
people and you just
didn't feel anything for them i've seen
another human being and at least
okay at least we have to move on from
sex because it just
bores me that's it all right let's move
on
with you let's let's move on all right
so
why are you unemployed why because he
doesn't have a job
dumbass shut the
f that's also not very interesting
um okay well tell us an interesting way
wait what are you eating that sounds
good to say what are you eating
this is uh briar's ice cream
what type though like what flavor
interesting cinnabon
food uh is a banned subject sorry
i promise where are the rules they're
basically only two okay the thing is
that
sex is boring and i hate food
uh okay what is it what what's your
favorite are you a virgin
wait what's your favorite drink
my favorite drink yeah water
that's nice
um you should ask me
should i ask you what first you should
um
huh bilge.world what the [ __ ] bilge
i joined your discord server well i have
a question bro
did you like club penguin like were you
a co-playing cub club penguin player
he no no no no he only plays word you
have to understand that
well no like are you a club penguin like
you remember when club thing
was mentioned i don't think i ever
bothered to figure out what it is oh
have you ever played any video games in
your life
oh yeah i played call of duty mobile
this morning
oh right do you only play mobile games
do you have like an xbox or like
what's a crackalack of my brother
um
i wouldn't even consider it like
uh like well what kind of what
do you like sports motor racing
i like motor boating
which sort all sorts
both sorts simultaneously
what okay actually that's the thing
motor voting as in doing some sort of
like uh
like that gag like sound you make with
yeah that's good too you know i [ __ ]
with that between
like what i mean it must be a very very
specific
like all sorts that people regular
doesn't matter i can't imagine as like
a sexual context where i would
like okay my next
course of action would
like seriously in a non-joke way
be um hang on a second
uh let me put my face between your
breasts
and make any time any time any time bro
just
hit me up
okay i understand it's funny to say
it's not funny i'm just being available
or whatever but like
okay bear with beyond that think about
it what if i
dog with you remove the funny bit
well i'm not trying to be funny i'm i'm
literally telling you i'm available
in like i
why why would you be compelled to say
that to someone who just told you that i
have no sexuality
out of all the things you can ask me you
can ask me like
uh what's your favorite animal
i mean it has to be my dogs it's not
very interesting
well that was just a boring answer you
should ask me uh
what my favorite world intellectual free
rifle was
your favorite what
what was your favorite war dems
oh boy my favorite war
um probably the great war
like i just you know
what's your favorite word processor
uh i believe adrian's trying to say
what's your favorite
anime if you if you my favorite anime is
milky homes

urls
biography
yes men are so boring i know
what would you like me to talk about mr
uh
spoon we can spoon
um wait so would you
d would you rather have a girl in here
actually that's a good point i probably
wouldn't have
continued like just [ __ ] around for
this long
um so so you're welcome you know i've
got your stream going for
an hour and 20 minutes but i've been
carrying it it's been
it's been really interesting in my
opinion
but you're making it uninteresting but
by not talking about
food and uh whoa what would you like to
talk about
david blew the yes the difference
actually writer oh my god
that is editorial you are the host of
this stream
my original subject was going to be i'm
writing a thing called
against a social media methodology and
my primary reason like forever
going on an app like this is basically
just to screw around
because i'm not gonna this is not gonna
lead
to any financial
gain right yes i will i believe in you
i i need to require something of you
because i need to require help if we're
going to keep it going
i'm thinking about like what you could
do
[Music]
um
yo um i think
um yeah so so what's your favorite a
word like what's your favorite thing
about word
i mean it's my favorite thing about word
is
like it's [ __ ] broken
uh i don't know i don't actually like it
all that much
it just seems like i do because
okay i don't know i don't actually know
if i
really like or enjoy anything anymore so
but uh i don't know
okay i kind of like if i were to be this
is how sad it's gotten
this is how little i have left okay
yeah don't worry about yourself in the
brief moments when i
actually fantasize about some future
that i may want to attain
it would be like being known so there
are different ranks
within the microsoft developer community
uh of like certifications in office
i want to be the the most
i want to be the king of microsoft word
i want to be the most
certified person in microsoft's word in
history the most original
gangster
[Music]
out of all the things the most the most
original gangster
i guess you're young whoa
do you plan on having children do you
plan on
like i don't know planting your seed
well then no that i gotta see you know
what do you plan on having children
um there are
so many reasons not to that i can't
possibly imagine that i would ever find
myself thinking i should conceive of a
biological child
would you adopt one i mean that would be
the only
way that i have a child uh
i don't know honestly i don't i'm more
worried about
much more worried about the illiteracy
thing right now
um hey um mr david
blue what are your thoughts on how i'm
hitting with
hitting women
uh read
uh literally anything else instead
what's your thoughts on the virus the
coronavirus
it stopped sucks i mean
the virus itself is in i yeah i can
agree sequence of rna
i think it sucks
so how have you been holding up well
will you um will you take
will you take the corona shot the crown
i mean
certainly yeah uh if
i ever like and regularly
physically around people again
you know how have you never mind never
making what might help is if you went to
bilge dot world slash about maybe
uh because if you're actually interested
in me this is this is the puzzling thing
you spent so much time on this already
um
it's not that much of a spectacle
but you haven't like
i have a question i have a question what
are your thoughts on the school system
in america i mean it's [ __ ]
uh quite thoroughly
would you say like high school is a
waste of time
no no you wouldn't say it's a waste of
time
certainly not so you think you think
it's a word
uh to go to high school damn maddie
maddie 2012
did you finish high school i did what
about college do you think college is a
waste of time
that is just going to depend on the
situation
again i just there's so many things
before that
like how the [ __ ] are we gonna dispose
of all these batteries
how are we going to like uh
maintain so in america especially
our interstate system has not changed in
design since it was built in the 1940s
um i'm really worried about
the amount of people who uh
talk about like absolute
fantasies like
um spend their time having
engaged conversations about uh any mars
missions that we might be going on
um
that's just like that's deeply
concerning
ah hey do you not like the space
industry maddie's spamming your channel
i don't know why okay
well sorry maddie like
can't do hitler um
[Music]
there's so many more interesting edgy
things that you could have shown
like
uh a [ __ ]
um an a introductory video
to a christian summer camp from the
early 90s
you find you find some of those
and that's really that's really specific
um you know david blue i i think we give
uh
mr maddie 2012 one more chance
hmm and and you think that
i guess so this is a community now yeah
uh
what was your favorite subject in school
where you look at history
like you were i thought that i was
better than anything ever taught at
school electronics hardware electronics
uh but it wasn't about the subject it
was about the person teaching it
oh
um what do you mean as
in he was just like the first person
that i ever encountered who'd actually
worked in the industry he was teaching
about
extensively um
and i was just an [ __ ] as a kid as an
elitist
isolationist [ __ ]
it is funny though because what you guys
were born after 2000
and you're it is it's crazy that we're
still joking like the jokes that come to
mind
the stupid jokes are 911 and uh
hitler i don't know what that maddie guy
was on about
apparently maddie's only nine years old
this is
maddie 2012. yeah
means a nine-year-old did the hitler
thing
i mean i was reading about world war ii
history when i was that old
but uh
yeah yeah
i don't even know
i guess i should be more deliberate
about
being non-deliberate in this broadcast
and i should have at least looked at
what the output looks like when i have
people in here
who are also streaming
they're not streaming
have you gone to the website yet
we're on the website the hap one the
haps
no build stat world oh that one let me
go to that one
how many how many wait how many
platforms are you streaming on right now
um so not all the ones that are on apps
but
uh youtube facebook twitter
live uh
i think that's it twitch.tv so you
probably have like a bunch of people
like
commenting no no i'm trying to chat to
you
well definitely well definitely in your
twitch chat someone was
trying to talk to you but couldn't get
to you because you're unhaps
well it's that person that they're still
listening i do apologize i'm just
anti-black what was the title of the
stream again um
uh i don't like children or something no
no no okay it was okay so you were
you were in the bathtub section of
twitch with like asmr tags
for some reason
i mean i've
i put put way like more ridiculous
metadata
in streams before what i just put in
chat
is what your stream title is that's what
it is
um
i see okay here's the thing that puzzles
me if i was
like had stuck around this long and
taught
like was talking to someone i just
discovered uh especially
if they were as easily visible like
everything that i have ever said i don't
mean just like
it's doing a youtube video somewhere i
mean like
um i don't know to a certain degree
you could go and look up you could go
search my personal wiki for sex
and find nothing uh
but i definitely would have like at
least gone back in
in the twitter feed far enough
to uh
[Music]
find what i was about to reference which
is like i wrote
like five assumptions about social media
um i think i've retweeted them recently
but uh so you're not
you're not like to go into a
relationship
like you're waiting hold on i lost my
dream i'm a demigod
what's your favorite god like are you
like you [ __ ] with zeus
the sun i said that already it is the
only rational
object of worship in human history
it's the source of all energy basically
for us
right not literally but so you said you
think
you said the sun is gone how do you
think the world was created
again there are things on which i
actually have interesting and unique
things to say
creationism is not one of them
well unfortunately i don't know those
topics
but they're exciting places to find them
[Music]
yeah thanks i i i'll start i'll start
doing my research
i went back to school for the first time
in seven years for one semester
at the community college that i went to
when i was like [ __ ] 19.
um
and yeah uh
nobody knew how to use google none of my
classmates knew how to use google and it
was [ __ ] scary
what do you mean just just search
something up what do you mean
use google i mean they like would
regularly
uh i guess basically like they would
regularly ask questions or like
that uh i would have
years ago the kids at that far ahead of
me
would it would be normalized for them to
learn that now
wait what questions like what were they
asking about
anything they were asking about anything
yeah do you know anything no
no you'll figure that out eventually
about yourself
unless you're gone which
but uh yeah i everyone
like i uh i grew up on a farm until i
was 14
uh and then i had a very privileged
upbringing because uh my siblings were
all
at least 15 years old to me so they're
all
um and you know they told me all the
time i'm the this is the 90s when it's
like
still like you really want to celebrate
this smart
uh youngest child the smart fat cheat
glass is wearing a
white boy he's really smart
he's gonna go someplace you can do
anything you want
did you know that i and it's
i'm just not blaming it all on them but
uh
i've basically my whole life has been uh
like my whole adult life has been
realizing in ever more profound ways
um how little hey mr david blue
huh uh i was going through your twitter
and um some why did you retweet
uh kissing chickens
okay i'm literally writing an essay
right now against
social media methodology so
uh are you i guess okay
if you're gonna make me answer that with
an actor
um
what if i could quantify that in words
i mean it's mostly because i could right
like because i saw something that was
like amusing for half a second
so uh-huh
that's yeah does that answer the
question
yeah what you should be asking is uh why
have you tweeted so much about why have
you tweeted
using streaming services and like why do
you hate spotify so much
why do you hate spotify so much uh
because why do you hate spotify
so much well for one there's one
specific figure
that uh name is ksi
can you see the chat yeah i could see
some
some guy named pringles red said hi
let's see if i have it in my
shorts manager here
don't let me down
i just spelled band camp band cap
nope i failed
i'm assuming that i can't leave the app
oh
what's the [ __ ] url what is it
this is not how i thought today
um i can do a bunch of 15 year olds on
uh
hams
uh hang on
i gotta pull myself together here
leo can we invite uh pringles red in
here
[Music]
maybe maybe we can spark something up
there
if you can bring uh uh spark something
look at me bro i'm i'm red white and
green
try again not funny something
come on pringles man not funny god damn
it something is so
loud that it is clipping so badly
that there are uh
actual like um
what am i thinking of the type of
distortion that turns into triangles
microsoft just tweeted i love triangles
microsoft said where's the word did they
really because i've been waiting for
that for my whole life
i actually like reserved it's not that
like i
the seats that i really took anyone's
spot but
i reserved a lot of spots for microsoft
build rooms today and i honestly don't
think that i would be gaining anything
more
uh because they just all want to talk
about [ __ ]
microsoft teams add-ins
hmm
oh you know when i had an online
magazine
i thought that was pretty original with
this i
set up a system of redirects before i
knew that
like on the on the domain
it's extraton.com demand and
so i'd like have a bunch of cool
redirects like
uh i don't know for a bit for the
bandcamp essay
i would talk about it'd be like slap
you go to extraton.com bc and it would
launch you off there
uh but also like whatever anyone would
be like what
what are you on facebook or any other
social site
you could just be like extraterrent.com
uh all the abbreviations you could think
of fb
uh that's the only way to give you um
[Music]
and it would bounce you to to the
facebook page
i miss that so much because
um the notion [ __ ] page that i have
at davidblue.wtf
yeah go to that
good good did anyone go to davidblue.wtf
i i went to your website to join your
discord server
yeah i also went to uh david blue what
the [ __ ] man
so you went to the the
the david bloom did you have you have
like a profile for like
everything dude why
that's why i linked you there uh yeah
it's kind of a good place to start for a
person on the web
yeah fox or no keyeasy
really didn't explore very far well no i
went to your uh
instagram beat it and then have you ever
heard of
have i ever what
have you ever heard a banana have you
ever heard of a man named aiden ross
what about uh wait give me a sec i
forgot the guy's name oh nero
neil armstrong heard of that guy
do you think the moon landing is fake
oh guys
are these the questions that you ask
like girls on tinder
when you first meet them oh i don't
[ __ ] know now i've done a bunch of
ridiculously crazy [ __ ]
and told you where and you're and you're
curious but you
did we'd ask you a question and then
you'd go like way off topic half the
time we don't even yeah that is the
thing i do
so that's my fault i'm sorry you're fine
it's okay i still love that
you don't even understand what the
[ __ ] going on
he can't comprehend you want me to ask
you um what i asked
uh girls on tinder no uh
what can i do to provide value for your
life right
what what uh what do you think what
would you imagine
i could do how do i not fail high school

on where you're going
are you in a public high school yes sir
in what part of the country
uh well illinois what part of illinois
playing field mutual customization oh
god isn't point
blankfield's just a suburb of chicago
right yeah basically
red is streaming i don't even know what
that is oh god i forgot i should i have
to look at the
i think oh he's streaming asmr
why is there uh why is he streaming asmr

you don't even remember your own
thoughts for no i was i don't remember
how you searched a specific year on
google

either
dave so in quotations to make sure it's
not
there's more asm behind the camera
and one of my subscribers has been
wanting me to do
is way cooler i can agree i can't really
hear with those asmr in the back
okay you can come back if you bring me
something more entertaining than asmr
um guys
so i do asmr
um [ __ ] i forgot where i was going with
the
what's that asmr are we still on the
search or did you give up
i i gave up because there's no way i'm
going to find david blue nissan juke
2015 okay okay
you need this do i have to go through
like your twitter no
millions of profiles search in
quotations
so one quote and then david blue nissan
juke
and then a quote on the other side yeah
i i did that
and then it just gives me pictures of a
nissan juke
um okay add the word honk in there
okay add the words with commas honk
comma extra tone e-x-t-r-a
t-o-n-e
or [ __ ] there's this there's a short
link but i can't remember what it is
it's been so many nissan juke nismo oh
yeah that's it hunk episode
five there you go that's
a 20 minute video no this is definitely
this is i wanted you
okay i wanted to not have to do that for
you uh you guys need to
granted you couldn't have known about
that because i didn't actually title
that very well
your comments are very interesting uh
toy story 3.
that's one comment it's not i don't
actually worry about that video um if
you want to see the craziest video go to
the same channel
i think it's the featured one if it's
not the featured video
begging the toyota avalon for uh
self-fulfillment
is the highest i've ever been on cocaine
cocaine in my life
um you filmed yourself on cocaine
will we be on your youtube channel oh
you played gran turismo
that's more interesting than the highest
i've ever been on cocaine in my life
wait will it be the mouse review too i
also like the mouse review
why well this candace be on your youtube
channel
oh [ __ ]
wait what happened oh he's gone
i'm still here i know you know
but will i be on your youtube channel mr
david
i mean honestly i don't yes you are
right now
but uh
i feel like i'm looking at like let's go
do you know who the baby is i'm like at
like nine years ago
spying on hot girls what
wait do you know who the baby is yes
are you a fan of the baby uh
i don't really listen to uh yeah yeah
i'm just thick i'm gone modern rap
because uh
i will never be uh i'll never
finish honestly listening to dj's screw
i'll never
like feel like no
i haven't listened too much my
ex-girlfriend uh really liked him
and then he did something and she was
like i can't like him anymore
so i guess that's the closest i have to
a sentiment onto babies like
uh and then the next thing i would say
is listen to big crit
uh listen to
cartwright circa tour and flying lap is
that the one where you're on crack or is
that just your happy face
okay the one where i it's cocaine
it is different uh is
called begging the toyota avalon for
self-fulfillment and i think
actually
yes it's puppy item
oh [ __ ] yeah you do look oh my god
hey i found the [ __ ] bit link
what is that for bill daley self avalon
it's a short link so that
it redirects you to that video how are
you okay
how old are you i'm uh i
am 15. i'm 12.
okay um these are things
that's older i'm into older people
[Music]
i also end up apologizing apologizing to
my mom in that video
um
it's uh so this girl i met on tinder who
eventually became
um like our lives were very intertwined
for a while she's my
best friend for a while but she her
first exposure
ever to any of the stuff that i've ever
done was that video
and she used to always tell me whatever
you do
like stop showing people that video
because um
why don't you delete it
well i'm not saying that i believe this
i'm just saying i just think it's funny
that out of all the [ __ ] that i had done
i don't know all the things that this
person had seen me do
still every time i brought it up was
like you need to stop telling people uh
but yeah i mean it's it's pretty
entertaining so i guess
yeah what are your thoughts on the shrek
it's the shrek
franchise
uh oh god
um so i hate movies for one uh
i never really i guess i never really
got into shrek means thing
but actually the funniest thing is to me
like three years ago i watched with that
person i was talking about
shrek um for the first time
as like someone who actually paid
attention to movies like growing up
enough that i uh
and that was one of the movie last
not one of the last but like roger e
roger ebert was still alive uh to review
that movie
and it is definitively the most positive
roger ebert review i've ever read he was
like
shrek is a it's a god tier movie it was
for
like the like the definitive american
voice like the most widespread american
critical voice on cinema for the 20s
like
basically all of it yeah it was one of
his
it was like his his god movie yeah would
you agree with that
would you agree with it
i just don't like movies so i i like
that fact about this movie a lot more
than
anything else about it oh
other than the like the smash mouth eggs
but that
was that could have happened
independently i had so much to do
so much to do so much to see so much to
do so much to see you so much
how about what i'm out of this [ __ ] you
were
you were calling when you were on drugs
what what is that good dad
i can't zoom on this
um it probably is time for me to [ __ ]
so much to do so much to see so much to
do so much to see
too much to do so much to see so
much to
see oh yeah i forgot that i made a
[ __ ] poster of that
on uh you know you know what you posted
seven years ago
what you jerking off no
epic and then it's just 9 11 with
bazinga at the end
yep that's amazing i love it and i
recently did a
100 audit of that channel and determined
so anything that
you see that's been left public was
something that i
launched and determined yes this is
worthwhile
this should remain i i agree with you i
fully agree with you
that should remain none of the drywall
videos are like
more funny than any other i think that
like
yahoo auction saline solution
um i don't know
is the most creative of the drywall
feature films for sure uh
and it involves a scene of me just like
reading from a book but like screaming
it as fast as it can
uh i don't know why but that that one
gets me every time
well i have to go mr david but we'll be
streaming another time
[Music]

text you on discord

nothing that's going to be like

couldn't give you a day and it's like a
date and a time
