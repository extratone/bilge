I finally received the Apple Support scam call I asked for for Christmas! 

The end result wasn't all that exciting - she hung up as soon as I asked her which iCloud account of mine she was referring to.

It almost certainly doesn't matter, but here are the two numbers involved.

The number of the caller: +1 (800) 297-2199
The number from which I received an RDP invite link via SMS: +1 (844) 334-6022
