Success found in my first attempt to sever the Drynet's folder permissions from Wordpress-exclusive internal consumption. I think it was /wp-content/uploads, legitimately.

Definitely tired now. I can't tell you when I last went to sleep, but I *can* tell you it's been 13.5 hours since I went on break yesterday. There's a coalition CTA at 1900. (Really need to rig up an easily-accessible GMT-set chronograph.) I suppose it was the worst time to spend two hours listening to The Mittani's content. The Mittani for *The Mittani*, that is. It's probably fairly obvious by now, if I haven't explicitly stated it already, that *Eve* is one of my many repeated attempts at distracting myself from the Meagan reality. This is the trade I must(??) accept? Meagan for The Mittani...

Dystopia.

Brent's house reminds me of hers, I think. I suppose that sounds ridiculous, but their neighborhoods are of similar age. I talked to my camera about Meagan for awhile this morning. My best memories of all time are all tied up in that girl - I can't let them go.

Brent specifically Tweeted his aversion to social contact yesterday, so I didn't say anything to him when I got home. I'm beginning to wonder if my current state is already affecting him. I guess I should try to minimize the amount of grief I post - even on my private account. Adderall does a good job of staying the bleakness, in particular. It's one of my least-favorite feelings - and I'm certain the preference originated from childhood.

Still, I think I've done extremely well keeping up appearances, considering that I am essentially just a ruin of David Blue.
