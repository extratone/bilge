Ate enough food at Arby's to sustain me for a day and a half, I'm sure, and it was only ~$8. Went downtown with the intention of parking in Lakota to write again, but Spencer Larson was outside Kaldi's and he called+beckoned. He's changed a bit - must less evangelistic, but still just as socially anxious. I told him that I really have no idea where I'm going, and am reluctant to think about it until I've made some resolution with the Meagan thing. I suppose I hadn't quite defined that so explicitly internally until that moment.
