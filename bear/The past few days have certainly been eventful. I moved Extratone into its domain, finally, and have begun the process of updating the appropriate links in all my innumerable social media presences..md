The past few days have certainly been eventful. I moved Extratone into its domain, finally, and have begun the process of updating the appropriate links in all my innumerable social media presences.

I'm sure my mind actually enjoys the intricacies of web management, but the reality, I think, is a reduction in my creative output, overall. It is necessary, though. I know now that I would never be satisfied by delegating the task to anyone else.

I have also made virtually zero progress on *Drywall's Written History*, but I'm technically only halfway through the week-long period I gave myself to cough it up.

In *Eve*, I experienced my first *real* big fleet fight in Saranen. I use such language because the time-dialaton system was triggered to bring the passage of game time down to 10%, which is so ridiculously tedious that I was able (or, required, I suppose) to take an AFK smoke break *during* the fight. We were all anchored on Rocky Aivoras, burning away from the mostly-Megathron BS fleet the Goons deployed.

Also of note: this was my first time undocking the coalition doctrine Cerberus fit, which I named *Michmethah, the Gift of a Striker*.

Astonishingly, our fleet didn't lose a *single* vessel in Saranen, and our coalition only lost ~25 billion ISK as opposed to The Imperium's 100 billion.
