I need to shave. Nicole is coming today at some time. Both her and Aunt Nancy are leaving on Sunday. I think it's been awhile since I've done a note...possibly missed a day. I've gone through two rolls of toilet paper in two days because of potty issues. I think it was Wednesday that I submitted an application to HyVee...applying for a part time position at the gas station. Been playing A LOT of STO. I really want a lifetime subscription but I'm sure that won't happen anytime soon given that it's $300.
