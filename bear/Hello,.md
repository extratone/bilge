Hello,
I'm David Blue, Editor-in-Chief of extratone dot com, and I am supremely thrilled to introduce you to a new podcast from *Studio Eat* about human communication - past, present and future.

It's called *Contrast*, which is nice, right? Almost clever.

I've come to understand that what I find funny is rooted in two primary narrative circumstances: **contrast** and **spectacle**.

I think we'll start with some definitions:

**Contrast** - "the state of being strikingly different from something else, typically something in juxtaposition or close association."

**Spectacle** - "a visually striking performance or display."

We intend to continually realize our fascination with the relationship between them in a palette of discussion and more scripted recitation.

However, our new show is by no means a primarily-amusing podcast.

You've heard this before: narratives from a personal perspective are almost always more effective than those told from the back row. I've been content back there, looking and yelling at the ceiling like a senile cat. Nice wide strokes.

It's very freeing, and it *does* lend to the sort of podcasting I've been doing. But at this point, I'm much more interested in the challenge of the moulding.

So. Let's get specific. Notice how good podcasts are often defined by a persisting set of iconic characters? We've done our best to make it happen, and haven't been entirely unsuccessful.

There's my friend **Shinji** - the world's least cringy white rapper and world war two enthusiast.

And **Nina**, Culture Columnist at Extratone and vaporwave goddesss.

Both are far superior storytellers to the third host.  Me.

But let's not forget! You're included!

If you've got a good story or some original music to share with us, send it to horn@extratone.com or visit extratone.com/submission.

Our current target episode length is 30 to 60 minutes in 192kbps stereo mp3.

We're very excited to have Noah B's music available to define our sound! You can listen on your own by visiting this is noah b dot bandcamp dot com or look for his tracks hyperlinked by order of appearance in every episode's show notes.

*Contrast* is a challenge to my own creativity's lack of design. I'm very much looking forward to freshening up *Studio Eat* with some quality narrative.

Look for episode one in the coming weeks.

For better or worse,
you'll hear from us again.
