Mom came up to me today and told me Gary has refused to drink water or eat for 2 days now.... So he doesn't have much time left. I picked Meagan up in his car today to charge the battery. It was weird to realize that he went from being able to drive himself to dying in less time than it took to discharge the battery in his car. Meagan and I played Star Trek Online most of the night. The story is getting better. Tomorrow I'm going to class in the morning and then working from 3PM to 11:15PM.... Which is going to suck. I hope I'm able to make it through it. Also got the textbook for comp for free online as an eBook.
