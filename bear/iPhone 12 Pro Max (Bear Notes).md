The test if the handset is too big: OPERA TOUCH MAYNE.
- [ ] My rule about the phone not leaving the house without a case on. 
## Software (iOS)
- [ ] They finally removed that awful texture background from Apple Notes!! Holy shit!!!
- [ ] Does this make the case for Apple One?
- [ ] Is it really a walled garden anymore?
- [ ] It’s tempting to say that stereo playback on iPhone’s speakers may even be better than my Surface Laptop 2, but I’m too unsure of my own ear to commit to that. 
- [ ] [lol](https://twitter.com/brendohare/status/1340096543181910018?s=21)
- [ ] Most of the shortcuts I use most are quick fixes for abilities that iOS *should* have natively (like shutting off wifi and bluetooth.) 
- [ ] Not having to worry about dropping my phone in water is actually amazingly freeing...

I’m afraid we must look back *yet again* to the [iPhone 4](https://youtu.be/cER36crkkVw) in this review, and not just because the 12 Pro has returned to those beautiful edges. (I don’t know if I’ve said it yet, but hey! This is the first truly beautiful phone I’ve owned in a long time.  
“It’s scientific fact that a phone [screen] over 3.5 inches is impossible to use.”
