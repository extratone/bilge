Brent and I watched *Smart House* for the first time in over 10 years, for myself. Strangely enough, it was actually directed by LeVar Burton. I remembered that it was the only Disney movie I ever found legitimately disturbing, but not that it was actually in *pity* of the AI, not fear. She is the real tortured party in the film, and we don't see any resolution of her captivity, either. Immediately before the film ends, Nick (hardcore simpleton default Dad) remarks that we leave them with a Pat who is "serving, but not interfering." Make no mistake - his is referring to real slavery.
