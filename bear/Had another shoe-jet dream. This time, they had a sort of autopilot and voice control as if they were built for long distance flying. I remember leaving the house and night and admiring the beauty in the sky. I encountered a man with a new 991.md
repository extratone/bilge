Had another shoe-jet dream. This time, they had a sort of autopilot and voice control as if they were built for long distance flying. I remember leaving the house and night and admiring the beauty in the sky. I encountered a man with a new 991 911 and he let me drive it around the access road (I'm presuming the I-70 access road.) He was very nice. The car had a PDK but the interior was off from what it actually looks like. Earlier I was in some sort of hotel room. Morgan was there and we actually acknowledged each others existence.
