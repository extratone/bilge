# Reflecting on Apple Arcade and the Blistering Evolution of Mobile Gaming
## The world’s most valuable company takes on gaming distribution, as told from a non-gaemer’s perspective.
I’ve now spent 56 days with Apple’s current flagship handset (more on that coming soon) and the experience has been even more profound than I expected, for a variety of reasons. One of them has been an enlightening returning exploration of “Mobile Gaming,” thanks in large part to the free 3 month trial of Apple Arcade included with the purchase of the device. This space - now probably best described as this *industry* - has expanded exponentially since my last visit. One of the first apps I remember downloading when the App Store launched in the Summer of 2008 was a brutally simple *Pong* ripoff, which had zero options, zero multiplayer or connected functions whatsoever, yet managed to be buggy as fuck.
