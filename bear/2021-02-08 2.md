Sleep schedule is massively screwed up.
Mom woke me up around 11 and insisted that I need to get a job..... Even though I have an application for CASR. I'm going to wait to turn it in until tomorrow because I broke my razor a few days ago and my face is scraggly as fuck.

Working on Fleet and the Furious: Drakesville Drift (just the promo video now.) This software is awful....but oh well. I'm going to attempt to write an actual screenplay for this film, and we're going to put effort into its production (hopefully.)

I was scheduled to play a Drywall set at the birthday party of a girl we met a Dryfest but I canceled last night. I didn't have anything prepared. (The show is on the 22nd.)

I've been watching House of Cards on Netflix as a sort of substitute for Mad Men.

The end of the summer semester is approaching and my grades are awful (especially in Algebra.)

Money is very low from paying the speeding ticket.

Spent the last of the cash I had from Bojangles' catsitting on McDonald's.

I wonder if I should keep track of what I eat in this journal so I don't overdo it on fast food.
