On the evening of February 22nd, 1950, under the notoriously-treacherous skies in which Charles Lindbergh co-originated the short-lived United States Airmail service thirty years prior, a ten pound, three ounce baby boy was born to Ernst and Marie Hohenburg, who very shortly afterword determined him to be the last of their then-five. By supper time, he was John Lin, because the Hohenburgs were very done with the process in general, and plum out of names.
