# Big Lapse in Distraction
This song came on the Bandcamp Weekly two nights ago and I just started crying a little bit. It’s hard to communicate why, and I’m not sure I even want to anymore. Everything and everyone is gone. I am left with those who have always loved me, yet I feel completely alone, which suggests that love must be conditional to be effective.

(Of course I know why it’s making me cry - the texture of this track is identical to the music I surrounded us with when we were falling in love and my brain just ​**can’t stop wanting for it**​.)
