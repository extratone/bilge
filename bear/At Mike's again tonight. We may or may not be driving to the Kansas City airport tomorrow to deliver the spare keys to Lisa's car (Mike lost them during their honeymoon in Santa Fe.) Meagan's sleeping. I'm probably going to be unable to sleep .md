At Mike's again tonight. We may or may not be driving to the Kansas City airport tomorrow to deliver the spare keys to Lisa's car (Mike lost them during their honeymoon in Santa Fe.) Meagan's sleeping. I'm probably going to be unable to sleep much due to all the caffeine I had recently. I really hope the Miata will be able to make the drive. They're going to pay me back for gas. Gotta check my bank account, thinking about it.
