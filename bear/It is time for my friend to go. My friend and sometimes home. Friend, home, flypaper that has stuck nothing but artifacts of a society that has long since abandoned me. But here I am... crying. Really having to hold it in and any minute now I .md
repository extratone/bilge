It is time for my friend to go. My friend and sometimes home. Friend, home, flypaper that has stuck nothing but artifacts of a society that has long since abandoned me. But here I am... crying. Really having to hold it in and any minute now I must sell a damned car. A truck.

Gary made something truly unique. He put his mind to it, too. How many gifts of such a caliber have I *really* gotten in my life? Or - perhaps a more pungent thought - how few (if any) should I *expect* to get?

And now, here they come across the bridge. Probably uniquely pleasant to me but this is my thing. This is my funeral.

So let's remember what I've learned.

I remember the day I discovered Route K and - shortly thereafter - the realization that I have always been calmed by the wordlessness of the driving process. Like when I can make myself alone with a piano - the rest is evermore significant to living.

Any minute now, I'm probably going to sell the first vehicle I had sex in - that's something I learned. The second home, really, so it should mean little, right? I can't honestly say that it holds much of Meagan for me anymore - thank the Sun. (I think that was *actually* wholehearted.)

And it was to *Danger* that I drove Meagan and Britta to the big tree after school - as often as possible - and we thought we could hear the stars through the speakers. And talked to Kailin - perhaps giving her what she needed to ruin that me. Fair and square, though.

But before all of that, it was my passage to the sky! Lessons over the early morning bluffs in a Cessna that'd been around for a half century. Austin and a radio scanner would come with me to Columbia Regional - that stagnant aviation oasis which embodies the state of the *Spirit* more than I'd want anyone to know.

I won't be able to say for certain for some time to come, but this could be my leaving home. It is not out of the question - I may feel significantly more alone. But - these days - I do not always dismiss what conventional wisdom says. I will continue driving on.
