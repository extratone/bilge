At home with Meagan watching Psych and playing Pocket Planes. Should be working on Math. There's a puncture in the Miata's left rear tire (nail.) I'm going to get it fixed tomorrow. It should be $16-17 at Big O. I turned in my application to CASR today. I think it was the manager that took it from me. I was able to tell her that I knew Andy. Wrote one of my favorite poems that I've ever written today. It's titled by the date.
