banglord is our Fleet Commander this morning.

There are 48 of us as we undock from the Citadel in one great, gorgeous mass.

"Everyone wave in local." banglord is alright with me.

Just think about how many chat logs I'll have.

"Just to change things up guys, warp yourselves to the outgate." - what an intelligent way to keep us awake.

And now we're having a race (aligned to the out gate) to let others catch up! I definitely need to meetup with these guys someday.
