I spent last night at Eryn's new house. (Which is adorable.)
We also hung out with Dan for a bit.
We had sex! I was really boring, though (which I regret,) but she seemed to enjoy it a lot? I'm glad, but surprised. She said lots of nice things like "you're bigger than I thought," which is all well and good, but damn... I need to get in shape again. Shameful. Maybe work on abs a bit?
