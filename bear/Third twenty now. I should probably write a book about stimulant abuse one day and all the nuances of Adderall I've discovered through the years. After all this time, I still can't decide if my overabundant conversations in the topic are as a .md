Third twenty now. I should probably write a book about stimulant abuse one day and all the nuances of Adderall I've discovered through the years. After all this time, I still can't decide if my overabundant conversations in the topic are as a result of some personally supreme awareness, or... Bullshit?

Really pushing it on the sleep, but I'm guessing any residual Vyvanse in my system is carrying some of the weight.

I feel strange. I shouldn't be surprised.
