*A third-party Twitter client is Risen, indeed!*

## Written
[[David Blue on Social Media Software]]
- [ ] In terms of reliability/bugs, I can say with 100% honesty that Tweetbot 6 has been more reliable than the native Twitter app in the past week or so.

### From Hand Notes
- [ ] 1st version release date (both on MacOS and iOS)
- [ ] Reviews of older versions
- [ ] More extensive search for Lists discourse
- [ ] App footprint size vs. the native app. -> 10.9MB vs. 115.8MB
- [ ] A bullet list summary of the API changes Twitter Blog post compared in a graphic(?) with any/all public statements/hints from Tapbots regarding specific feature additions relating to API changes.

#### Possible Interview Questions
- [ ] Reasoning behind such investment in lists - 2021 vs. first year of development
- [ ] Notable events/correspondence from Twitter - both public and otherwise
- [ ] Stuff you feel Twitter may have been “inspired” by Tweetbot to include in the native app (like keyboard shortcuts.)
- [ ] Most unusual feature requests from users.
