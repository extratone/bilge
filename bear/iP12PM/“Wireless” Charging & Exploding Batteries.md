- [ ] I *really* wish they’d treated us like adults and just called it what it ~is~: **Inductive charging**. On my part, at least, that would’ve made things a lot less confusing.

- [ ] If you were wondering whether or not wireless charging would cause a shut-down iPhone to boot like plugging it in to a regular charger always has, the answer is **yes**.

this Tylt thing - which AT&T gave my mom for free as part of the signup deal, notably - doesn’t actually tilt variably… it’s either this angle, or down flat. otherwise, it’d be the perfect phone stand I’ve been needing. pic.twitter.com/Hlef6s92zy

the screen has done that moderate flicker which indicates iOS is limiting brightness for heat management three or four times. I’m using 5G, too. this is all so fucking wasteful FOR NO REASON. debugger.medium.com/wireless-charg…

started out at 100% charge. it’s been 40 minutes and the readout currently says 96%. for the first 5 or so, it just continuously disconnected and reconnected. it’s stopped that, inexplicably, thank gourd.

you know I’ve been wanting to rant about this for a while, but I thought doing so using my phone while it is “wireless charging” for the first time would be the perfect moment.

more somberly, the fact that The Year of Phone Combustion (2016) didn’t prompt consumers to reflect hardcore on *why the fuck we are pushing battery tech so hard* is absolutely pitiful. theverge.com/2016/9/8/12841…

hot toke: “exploding” batteries are actually the best feature in the history of smartphones. for shear thrill, nothing comes close, nor does any other story you could possibly have to tell strangers at a bar about your phone.

## Battery and Magnets
I am genuinely worried about the future we continue to set ourselves up for, full of spent batteries and no way to responsibly despose of them.
