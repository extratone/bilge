[[Siri Voice Commands Documentation]]
[[iOS 14 Review Notes]]

- [ ] It was completely irrational for me to get a new phone at this point in my life, considering I never leave the house.

- [ ] Face ID... oh boy.

- [x] "Pacific Blue"

- [ ] The [battery percentage issue](https://www.imore.com/how-get-battery-percentage-your-iphone-x).

- [ ] I wish part of starting over included re-downloading all my shortcuts, tbh. ([Shortcuts Repo](https://github.com/extratone/shortcuts))

### Physical Controls
- [ ] [morganath on Mastodon regarding the Home Button](https://social.tchncs.de/@morganth/105330295770710815)

- [ ] “Gliding cursor” and 3D touch?

(Also, what the *fuck* is an “ESIM???”)
The test if the handset is too big: OPERA TOUCH MAYNE.

- [ ] My rule about the phone not leaving the house without a case on. 
## Software (iOS)
- [ ] They finally removed that awful texture background from Apple Notes!! Holy shit!!!

- [ ] Does this make the case for Apple One?

- [ ] Is it really a walled garden anymore?

- [ ] It’s tempting to say that stereo playback on iPhone’s speakers may even be better than my Surface Laptop 2, but I’m too unsure of my own ear to commit to that. 

- [ ] [lol](https://twitter.com/brendohare/status/1340096543181910018)

- [ ] Most of the shortcuts I use most are quick fixes for abilities that iOS *should* have natively (like shutting off wifi and bluetooth.) 

- [ ] Not having to worry about dropping my phone in water is actually amazingly freeing...

I’m afraid we must look back *yet again* to the [iPhone 4](https://youtu.be/cER36crkkVw) in this review, and not just because the 12 Pro has returned to those beautiful edges. (I don’t know if I’ve said it yet, but hey! This is the first truly beautiful phone I’ve owned in a long time.  

“It’s scientific fact that a phone [screen] over 3.5 inches is impossible to use.”
