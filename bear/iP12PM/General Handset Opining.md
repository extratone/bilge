# General Handset Opining
I was just about to Tweet “I’m surprised there’s not a better solution for browsing/interacting with Stack Overflow on iOS” before stopping myself and realizing what’s probably the general word among the stack types: *just use your web browser*. This led to a key differentiation I want to make. I often lament the recent emphasis on the development of Progressive Web Apps, Electron apps, and other variations of web browser-based containers masquerading as desktop-class software, saying the same thing: we really need to remember how powerful modern web browser are and accept that right now, a huge amount of what one should seek to do on a desktop-class operating system, specifically, instead of a mobile OS like iOS, is going to be done on the web from within a desktop web browser. I realize this direction of desktop development which I find detestable is the result of the industry’s fairly-recent emphasis on combining mobile and desktop operating systems/desire to create a platform mutable enough to work on both. 

Obviously, there are benefits to be had from the influence mobile OSs have had on traditional desktop OS development. The recent, quite monumental rollout of ARM-based Macs has probably been the single most poignant real-world example, ever, but I just wish to say this
