Leave it to  [Jon Rettinger](https://youtu.be/eRxq9IyZ4Cc)  to back me up on the size hype thing... Yes, the 12 Pro Max is *bigger*- and definitely prompts a conversation on how big we’re actually going to let smartphones get before we... idk.. call them something else(?) - but it’s far from *alarmingly huge* or anything, as  [Nilay Patel’s review](https://www.theverge.com/21555901/iphone-12-pro-max-review)  seems to suggest. It’s very possible that I say this out of Big Hand Privilege, though - auto journalist Matt Farrah (whom I trust completely) noted that he chose the 12 Mini because he can use it one-handed. It occurred to me, hearing this, that my own usership hasn’t really ever included this aspect. Nilay felt so strongly about the 12 Pro Max’s size that he recommends you find a way to experience its size in person before ordering one. My concern - as much as I love the idea of the 12 Mini - centers around the fact that I am already starting to struggle with the diminishing size of the buttons in the UX of popular apps like [TikTok](https://vm.tiktok.com/ZMe17ocYh/), and I’d rather not make my eyes struggle with text size any more than absolutely necessary. Handily enough, one can now access iOS’ text-enlarging slider from within the Control Center. 

For myself and others, the flat sides of the design prompt a reflection on how this may be the first genuinely beautiful iPhone since the iPhone 4.
