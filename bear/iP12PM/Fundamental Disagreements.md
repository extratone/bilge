# Fundamental Disagreements
## I fiddle with Shortcuts, but fundamentally hate automation.
This heading may very well be the most insightful and original contributions I have the opportunity to make. I’m not the foremost expert in Siri Shortcuts (and have absolutely zero desire to be,) as I only began using them after Apple had taken over Workflow, but I have made it my prerogative to learn enough to definitively answer the big questions I originally had about them for End Users, now.

## Fucking Widgets, Man
I remember finding widgets cool, but fundamentally useless way back in my Snow Leopard days. On a desktop - *especially* one in the center of your day-to-day workspace - widgets can make a lot of sense, in theory, but in my experience, the widgets I actually end up keeping are usually just bunk solutions to recurring problems with the platform I’m using which should have been solved by more thoughtful means. This continues to be exemplified in no small way in the Siri Shortcuts I use most of all - the one that disables Bluetooth and WiFi and the one that toggles the assistive touch button so that I can clear the iPhone’s RAM before opening a game. The history of widgets is also defined by the cacophony of broken-ass shit you have to wade through in order to find one that actually works. Throughout my using life, this has been all but a Universal Truth.

Because my mom runs her entire private practice on a single iCloud calendar (which has always made me nervous,) I thought she might appreciate having it displayed via The Big Calendar Widget on the top of her second homescreen, but her reaction validates how I (and the few others I’ve ever spoken to on the topic) feel about widgets: *can you just put it back to the small one, please?* I thought she was talking about the small widget at first but no, she meant the app icon.

*Why would I look at that when I could just open it?*

Indeed, one of the biggest question of our age.
