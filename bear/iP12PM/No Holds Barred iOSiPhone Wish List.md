# No Holds Barred iOS/iPhone Wish List
## Keyboard Integration
- [ ] Imagine… Global keyboard shortcuts to trigger Siri Shortcuts. Obviously, this is never going to fucking happen on the iPhone, but what about iPad? Mac?

- [ ] Imo, the ultimate implementation of this would allow one to custom map keyboard shortcuts for **every function available in the command center, at least**

## Misc
- [ ] An option to have a direct shortcut to a given app’s page in iOS Settings in its long press menu. (Doesn’t have to be enabled by default, but it’d be fucking handy!)
