"Moshi Overture Case with Detachable Magnetic Wallet (Luna Pink) PROFESSIONAL Unboxing & Thoughts"

In 2016, I bought an earlier version of Moshi's Overture case for my iPhone 6S and remember it very fondly as the singular product which helped me realize that smartphone accessories CAN BE TASTEFUL!

Naturally, I was elated to discover that Moshi makes the current version of the case to fit my iPhone 12 Pro Max: https://www.moshi.com/en/product/overture-case-with-detachable-magnetic-wallet/luna-pink-for-iphone-12-pro-max-snapto

Shot in a single take at 1x in 4K60 on my iPhone 12 Pro Max to test how it handles drastic changes in shooting environments while capturing continuous video.
