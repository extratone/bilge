Quite vulgar. I'd never imagine girls would find me attractive in this way. Maya and Catherine are pretty crazy, though, so I'm not sure I should value the niceties they said to me too highly.

I think I am most attracted to quiet, rational, and deliberate young women, but the only individuals who've voiced their attraction to me have been quite loud. I think I can honestly say independently of my love for Meagan that she is the "best fit" I've yet to find for myself. Especially after leaving my edgy phase - I think there would be much less abrasion were we to get back together. Considering that she hasn't replied to my email, though, I assume she is committed to 100% no contact. Kailin was an intermediary for our last correspondences, regrettably, and I revisited her last relayed (I hope) messages.

**I don't really know what to say. She says: She is done having any contact with you, that she said what she wanted to say, and that she is just going to mail you your stuff.**

**She says she doesn't want to have contact, I don't know why. And she's specifically said she doesn't owe you anything.**

Yeah... I should've read those first, I guess. It's funny that she interspersed "encouragements" like *everything will be okay* as if she possessed some wisdom I was ignorant of. It's all universal to her. At least I don't have to live that way. I'm really not feeling all that bad about it right now because I have enough stimulants in my system, I assume. After ferociously scouring the Internet on Friday night (note: I was coming down from Vyvanse for the first time in years, and it took me a bit too long to realize the possibility of its influence) for similar situations. There weren't many, but nearly all the advice stated the importance of making the decision to get over her and... Good God. That is the last thing I want. I guess my only hope then for having a societally-approved "healthy" life and/or relationship is that I will eventually fail to hold on to her.

And of coursε, Ι *still* find myself wanting to have this discussion with her, not a cloud-enabled cyberdiary. I guess I must be delusional and sick. Another obstacle to my *healthy recovery*: it is perhaps my most robust commitment to never live like them - to make up one's companionship with a little society of friends. If I am ever able to somehow extract her from my heart so that I may love someone else without literally destroying the core of myself, I may live again. The ability to even begin to conceptualize such an operation is *very* far in the future, though. In these 17 months, I have proven to myself, at least, that there was nothing lacking in my love for Meagan - I really *did* have what I wanted for those 5 years, even if I took it for granted at the time. And she inadvertently taught me so much, too. When I was crafting The Mechanism as a little boy, I always imagined it would involve grand mutual adventures, but all that time spent simply *existing* next to Meagan as she played *Animal Crossing* or *Harvest Moon*, or slaved away in her studies... That was the purest bliss I've ever experienced. (Or - given any current SITREP, the purest I ever *will* experience.)

And despite the magnitude of what you'd probably call *self-inflicted* suffering, I am immensely proud to have achieved what I did. I attained what I wanted most from existence - something even the longest-livers have an extraordinarily slim chance of reaching.

And my eyes are not sunken, nor my skin pale. I may be in tremendous financial and emotional debt, but I retain my fleeting vanity. And - in some rare moments of brief reanimation - I slip back into the cleanliness of youthful heart that allowed me to fall so deeply in love. Sitting in front of Kaldi's by the bluegrass band, I saw a serene young woman with beautiful curly hair confidently and silently striding by amongst a group of peers in a very cute white-striped medium blue summer dress, and I felt a brief flash of a pang in my heart - that ancient reflex that spins a romantic narrative for such a stranger in an instant, and resets the mind back to the intensity of The Mechanism when it was unused and primed for lifetime companionship.

If I were able to capture it long enough to observe something tangible from it, I'm afraid it would register as delusion. Those immediate fantasies take place outside of reality, in all likelihood. Send us away to an isolated sanctuary so that we may only look at each other, talk to only one another, and be guaranteed this Ultimate companionship for the rest of our existence. I'm not sure I'd ever write another word again - human creativity is borne of war, not total contentment. And have I been at war? Is it some form of warfare to conjure your identity from seemingly nothing, and ultimately be unable to even begin the process of concession with your environment? Is it strength, or is it weakness? Is it noble or cowardly? I tell you truthfully, I am completely unconcerned with the words, but that was not always the case. Fundamentally, I'm sure I believe I have *evolved* into superior form after superior form over my biography, but observers (mostly mom, I suppose,) insist that I am actually stagnant.

Good God folks. If nothing else, my bank account should be more than enough evidence to the contrary.
