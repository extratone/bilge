I've responded to the fleet CTA and came with the knowledge of who to "anchor" on during a fight. I've just gotten on a few killmails, I'm sure. We engaged a Confessor fleet in YKSC-A.

We are now bumping around asteroid belts. I heard the FC ask "did the DRONE WALKERS guys make it okay?"

It would seem they've joined the war. I think there's a legitimate possibility of detriment if I were to make this public information, though.

Sensor damps kept our range low on the first engagement. According to the FC, Round 1 went to them, and Round 2 to us.

Some interesting Goon chatter in local.

Sort Dragon, our FC, is now asking for an alt to light a cyno. I like him a lot. He's brutal, but that's exactly what we need. Perhaps because he's British, I find him particularly concise in the method he uses to issue orders. Tonight has certainly gone a lot better for me than the night a bit ago where I ended up not knowing who to anchor to.

Lost my Jackdaw in the last engagement, but swiftly bought a new one from 01Y-ED, the PH hub.
