# Aquaman (2018)
Well… What I picked up from this film was unlike any other superhero movie I’ve ever seen, which is important to celebrate considering the endlessly-regurgative Marvel hell we’ve found ourselves enslaved to. Unfortunately, the cinematography and special effects were… wrong, somehow. I say so with no small amount of caution - I don’t want to condemn a single filmmaking decision simply because it’s different from what I’m used to. Again - considering that films have become such stagnant, digestible products - *any* sort of genuine originality and/or innovation in the process of a major title’s production should be praised… dare I say it… even if it’s just…bad.

I did *not* really give *Aquaman* my full attention, though, nor have I read anything else about it. I guess I hope some folks loved it for its particular departures in that way which makes films truly special in their memory.
