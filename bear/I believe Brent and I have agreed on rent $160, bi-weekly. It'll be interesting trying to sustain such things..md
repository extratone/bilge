I believe Brent and I have agreed on rent: $160, bi-weekly. It'll be interesting trying to sustain such things.

As my payment for extratone.com has gone through, I should plan to officially launch it in one week. I think this is a good opportunity to finally draft up the *history of Drywall* as best as possible. I'd like my official title to be **Scry**, I think.

âˆ†

For as long as I can remember, I have been stricken with a primal need to "create" content of infinitely many sorts. In Kindergarten, I professed my love for my first crush in a "mixtape" recorded on a My First Sony. I can't imagine it possessed much musical value in the objective sense, but it was probably quite *Dry*, as we say in the movement.

*Elizabeth, hit me up if you've somehow retained the cassette. I would pay a hefty sum for it.*

In Elementary school, I spent a fair amount of time surrounding myself in a mass of cassettes and microcassettes sourced from garage sales and my mother's collegiate surplus. As **Brent** can attest, I often left a trail of them behind me whenever I traveled.

I also wrote a 60-something page novella inspired by *The Boxcar Children* in third or fourth grade, and it was quite terrible, as you'd expect.

My first videos on YouTube were awful firearm reviews as per my irreverence for Nutnfancy. (He's still the best tactical obsessive on the web.) And my brief obsession with the exploding personal technology industry spawned a terribly-named "tech review" channel that I shall spend the rest of my days trying to forget.

When I began my foray as a student pilot, I maintained a "vlog" for every lesson, including tremendously-tedious in-cockpit audio recordings. Though I've done my best to remove all traces of the product, the side-effectual experience I gained with audio and video came along with me to high-school, where its magnitude was - to my surprise - quite unusual.

Luckily, by my Junior year, I had found a group of friends that nurtured my lacking self-awareness,  gradually propelling me into a state of all-consuming embarrassment with my portfolio as it stood. This began a sort of reactionary period to the ideals I'd held in my youth, which I've just recently determined with confidence as the origin of *Drywall* as an ideological system.

I had put significant effort into everything I'd done. My tendency to obsess over revision was exploited by the capabilities of modern video editing software, particularly. Though it was always my own, there was always a standard of quality to crawl toward. All that effort, though, had gone toward work which was simply not lucrative, despite my own particular polish. Exposure - as it does - had drastically evolved my perspective, and left me with a worthless body of work spread over a plethora of identities due to my dabbling nature.

In conjunction with the daily conversations with my friends, I decided the solution was to consolidate *every* new work under one banner, which would operate entirely absent of any consideration for audience whatsoever. I knew that removing as completely as possible any filters from my "creative process" would exponentially increase my output volume, at least.

It was in those school lunch discussions that **Brent** and I discovered our mutual adoration of **clippng**, a classification of distortion unique to digital audio. All the while, I was learning the essential mechanics of electronic hardware under Jim Kyd's *Electronics I & II* courses. Though it wasn't a part of the curriculum, Mr. Kyd indulged those who would listen in little wisdoms he'd accrued throughout his various careers. I learned some finer points and foundational formulas in audio engineering, which I would put to use in our early productions.

The first was *The Tinnitus Ep*, for my friends' punk/noise band, Apathetic Cake Gluttons. It was a live recording on 5 simultaneous channels from 4 separate improvised sources. The final product could be considered impressive, I suppose, considering it is most certainly my first attempt at multitrack mixing. The band's Twitter account has survived the years, astoundingly, and still proclaims "we make music that you download."

I think the audio track for the *What the Fuck?* video got something like 80,000 listens on Brent's SoundCloud, but by most measures, the ancient web presence lies.

After that year, enough began happening in my day-to-day life that it's difficult to be definite about much. From what hard data remains intact, we can infer that the year (almost to the day) that passed between the death of the *Gluttons* and the first official Drywall release was spent honing my ability to consistently molest *Garageband 2008*, despite its restrictions as a wholly-pedestrian DAW. [Digital Audio Workstation]

That Christmas (2010,) I asked for a Samson C01-U condenser mic (a gift which has astoundingly survived 6 years of semi-regular use,) which allowed me to bypass the need for a digital audio interface by simply outputting directly to USB 2.0. Considering the breadth of environmental horrors we've subjected it to since (including *Miata Music 2*, the mixtape recorded, edited, "mastered," produced, *and* uploaded without leaving the open cloth seats of my NB MX-5,) I can proclaim it to be - without hesitation - the highest-value piece of equipment I've ever had the fortune to own.

Though I was afraid to abuse it, at first, as all the microphones I'd used were dynamic, cheap, and tolerant. But by late summer, I was willing to position it just above a treadmill to capture an integral sound to *Hamura*, the first and debatably-Dryest of my entire discography.

I recorded the first track, *The Deep Wound My Parents Left Me Because You Are Gone And I Have Too Many Won't Help Come To Me Tonight*, having yet to decide whether or not to call it Drywall or Hamura, with zero intention of monitoring each successive track as they were laid down.
