At home watching a 2013 episode of Top Gear. Today was a full 7 hour day at work. It wasn't as bad as I thought it was going to be. Tomorrow is my first day of classes. I'm pretty sure Nathan Riggs hates me because he thinks I'm a libertarian. Meagan and I spent most of the night playing Star Trek online. Yesterday, we took Jay to the vet and found out that she might have cancer.... Which sucks.
