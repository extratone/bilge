At home in mom's office so that she could go pick up pills for Gary. Apparently he's getting worse.... Mom says he hasn't eaten in weeks, but I think that's an exaggeration. First day of class for Western Civilization II, Public Speaking, and Geology was today. They were all pretty bad.... I'm not going to be able to use my phone in class, which sucks. At least it seems like they're all going to enforce it. And they're all male... Which is odd. The girl that works at Slackers is in my Public Speaking class and her name is Eva. Brock from Good Shepherd is also in it.
