Back and forth... Deklein to Branch and back over and over again.

The Goons are no longer on the map anymore... Everyone I bring it up with insists that "they'll be back." What if The Mittani decides to retire to a club life?

I am now on my way back to the citadel. I made it one jump out of RO.

I'm wondering if I should just stay at the Citadel... We just live too far away for me to ever respond quickly to pings.
