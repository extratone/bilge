## Returning Home... Again.
In June, I sorta sprung a single letter on you and mentioned that it would be the chosen means of publishing these, claiming – incorrectly, it would seem – to have been more or less forced to seek out the badly-designed and certainly less-discreet Revue, due to resounding rumors of TinyLetter’s imminent death. To be frank, I’m a bit confused by the affection for the rudimentary old service – all the cool personal tech and culture writer lists I once sought out and enjoyed have almost all fallen silent since 2016. I know the specifics of these companies, their products, and the interrelationships between them all don’t exactly make for thrilling reads, even for the most tech-embedded among us. Nevertheless, they have occupied a great portion of my learning, focus, and attention, and so this evening’s Psalm is inevitably populated with my experiences exploring the “future of WordPress,” my surprise-filled reacquaintance with Linux (both its literal and abstract existence,) Open Source computing in general, my month spent without reliable internet, and federated social networking.
