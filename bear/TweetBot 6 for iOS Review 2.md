# TweetBot 6 for iOS Review

![](TweetBot%206%20for%20iOS%20Review/OgxERkXE.png)Various - Tweetbot 6

## In the bleak face of Twitter’s centralization, Tapbots refuses to give up on its mobile client.
Were it just I who came to you with only my voice on this cold night, proclaiming the imminent release of a whole numerical version of a third-party mobile Twitter client in 2021, you really would have no choice but to send for the laws, for you’d be left no consideration other than my comprehensive descent into absolute insanity. [807 days ago](https://bilge.world/tweetbot-5-ios-review), I told you lots about the history surrounding the development of Tweetbot 5, which I confidently described as “likely the last com­pet­i­tive third-par­ty Twit­ter app for iOS.” After spending the past few months diving deep into iOS in preparation to [review and reflect](https://github.com/extratone/bilge/issues/45) upon Apple’s current flagship handset, my eyes have been opened to the exponentially-increasing pace of the whole environment’s metamorphosis during the course of my lapsed attention. In the name of progress, I’ve done my best to make a point of looking back, too, yet something astonishingly personally relevant managed to slip past me until just last week: **there is a sixth version of the Tweetbot app**. At this moment, [it is listed on the App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/tweetbot-6-for-twitter/id1527500834) as an “Early Release” version, though its predecessor can still be downloaded by those who’ve already purchased it in the past, like me. `Footnote: Though I was still able to find [a share link](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/tweetbot-5-for-twitter/id1018355599), it appears to be unopenable in a regular web browser, which will simply prompt you to open iTunes.`  This is an unusual practice - usually, pre-release versions of iOS apps can only be distributed through Apple’s developer beta testing infrastructure, though Testflight. Notably, Tweetbot developer company Tapbots was [apparently required](https://twitter.com/tapbot_paul/status/1354145779494100992?s=21) to take down Tweetbot 5’s store listing 30 days before releasing Tweetbot 6. `Footnote: I can’t think of any innocuous reason for Apple to do so. A month’s absence of a given software company’s flagship application sounds like a nerve-wracking punishment, nothing more. Discussed at length in this blog post written by someone I don’t have the time to look up, right now: https://mjtsai.com/blog/2021/01/26/tweetbot-6-for-ios/)`

I can’t remember exactly why - though I suspect I was just fucking around on my phone before bed, bleary-eyed - but the implications of this next numeral passed me by the first time I saw and downloaded Tweetbot 6, two weeks ago. Perhaps it’s because the app didn’t appear to have any new features - in fact, it’s technically got *less* than 5, though those that have been removed - user-specified URL shortening, image hosting, and video hosting services - haven’t worked in a good while anyway. As my old fav, *The Verge* noted in [their coverage of 6](https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/26/22250899/tweetbot-6-tapbots-ios-app-update-subscription-service-twitter-api), blame for these omissions rests solely on Twitter, Inc., itself, who’s continued to hold its API development inordinately close-to-chest. I didn’t bother to find out about this, though, because my first assumptions upon poking around the new app - especially after encountering its new subscription requirement in order to use any of its substantive features - was that its developers had ceased any actual time investment into the app long ago, and that 6 was a new version in number and rudimentary visual updates, only, shoved out in hopes of peaking old, loyal users like myself enough to get us to download it, at least. In the disappointment I’d already expected, I closed and immediately deleted the app.

I’ve paused everything else to write you on this, though, because the story is actually much bigger. Had I investigated any further that first time, I would have discovered an odd amount of buzz coming from even the most mainstream of tech media in a simple search. (Yes, I am ashamed about it.) You’re still reading, but perhaps - as I was, originally - you are doing so from an appropriately-jaded, well-read perspective on software, generally, in 2021. Perhaps you’re looking at the search results, yourself, and wondering if you’re dreaming. *Dedicated coverage of a fucking third-party Twitter client iteration??? At this point in history? What in fuck?* I’m fairly certainly neither of us are, though: fucking Tweetbot made headlines on [Engadget](https://www.engadget.com/tweebot-6-tapbots-twitter-app-subscription-model-launch-110526052.html), [TechCrunch](https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/26/tweetbot-6-released-with-new-subscription-pricing/), [9to5Mac](https://9to5mac.com/2021/01/26/tweetbot-6-new-features-subscription-model/), [MacStories](https://www.macstories.net/news/tweetbot-6-moves-to-subscription-pricing/), [iMore](https://www.imore.com/tweetbot-6-update-popular-twitter-app-and-it-brings-subscription-model), [MacRumors](https://www.macrumors.com/2021/01/26/tweetbot-6-subscription-pricing-change/), and others. No, it’s not 2010 again. In fact, *The Verge*, at least, has never given up on Tweetbot. If my long term memory had been functioning, I would have remembered noticing its spot in “[12 great apps for your new iPhone in 2020](https://www.theverge.com/platform/amp/22187376/best-iphone-apps-2020-apple-ios):”

> Twitter is a vaguely terrible way to spend your time these days, but if you (like me) can’t tear yourself away from the social media service / entryway into hell, you’ll want Tweetbot, which actually makes using Twitter far less painful. Tweetbot shows you the tweets of the people you follow, in the order that they tweeted them. There are no ads or promoted tweets, powerful mute filters to block out unwanted noise, and (thanks to Twitter’s unfriendly API changes) no notifications to constantly ping you to come back to the app.  
Here’s to Chaim for exposing me to a perspective I never would have otherwise considered: Tweetbot’s lack of push notifications as a *positive*. If you’re wondering, no, this new app does not ~yet~ include any additional notification integration, and it’s not clear whether or not it’s on Tapbots future roadmap for the app, or where. As for the reality of integrating Tweetbot 6 into your current Twitter use, I stand by my argument	that deleting the native Twitter app isn’t really an option if you plan to ever view your notifications on your phone. The popular assumption (I assume) if you’re still reading is that you are a “poweruser,” meaning details about my own configuration are probably irrelevant. If by chance you’ve just downloaded Tweetbot for the first time, you should take the time to disable notifications for Tweetbot entirely, but leave them on for the native Twitter app, even if you decide to banish it to your App Library. Before I began any work on this review, I made sure to swap in Tweetbot 6 where the native app had been in my dock for several years, now. I originally pushed the native app all the way to page 6, but immediately found this extreme. Instead, I put it in the bottom-right corner in my second screen, as you can see in the screenshot below (which also serves as proof, if you needed it.)


![](TweetBot%206%20for%20iOS%20Review/WMyY9kLc.png)Tweetbot vs Native Twitter Proof

I should also note how much my own engagement on Twitter has diminished in the past 3-5 years. Not to manifest tiny violins - in turn, my engagement on (and investment in) [Mastodon](http://bit.ly/dbmasto) has increased exponentially, and it’s of a *much* higher quality. I bring it up for context’s sake: I can afford to prioritize Tweetbot in my Twitter use because of how few daily notifications I get - a number which is unusual for someone who uses Twitter as much as I do. Inevitably, my own use is once again going to factor heavily in this work, as is the significance of my relationship with Twitter, generally, in my life. If you didn’t already know, I’ve met basically all of my friends since high school through Twitter. As of this moment, my private “Friends” Twitter List includes 149 accounts, and I’ve spent more than 10 years, now, reading almost every single one of their Tweets. I have been as critical of the service as anyone, but - whether or not either of us are willing to acknowledge it, wholly - I believe the intimacy of this arrangement to exceed that of any in-person relationship *I* have ever had. `Footnote: Though I have been trying unsuccessfully to write more on this dynamic for years, I still intend to do so, one day.` Reading the random thoughts of these people seconds or minutes after they’ve popped into their heads for all this time has been an experience unique to the format Twitter pioneered, if not to the service, itself. I have no choice but to acknowledge that I am *deeply* invested in not just Twitter, but Twitter’s less-than-visible Lists feature, emotionally and intellectually. When I hit my [follow limit](https://twitter.com/neoyokel/status/1281646353102147584), several years ago, Lists also became my single means of acquiring new connections on the network. If it were to be removed, I would lose this ability, entirely, as well as any reasonable means of communicating with any of my friends.

Perhaps you understand, now, why I have [written](https://bilge.world/twitter-lists) and [Tweeted](https://twitter.com/i/events/996616971880882176) so extensively about Lists. You should also understand just how miraculous the possibility of Tweetbot’s new future now seems, personally, unless you’re new to all of these ideas and don’t feel like reading that big olé Tweetbot 5 review of mine (which is fine.) Before I go into the history of Tweetbot, let me first share the single most telling feature in Tweetbot of Tapbots’ belief in using Lists and share some evidence of *others’* present day belief in Tweetbot. Shamefully, I’ve spent several years - tens, if not hundreds of thousands of hours - using Lists in Tweetbot, oblivious to its upmost Lists integration: “[Use Lists as Timeline](https://tapbots.com/support/tweetbot6/tips/list.php).” Had I actually bothered to look at the support docs at any point, I would have discovered this long ago, which would have almost certainly made my given year. **If you use Tweetbot and Lists, for the love of Gourd, please take a look**. Here’s what those docs currently say, in full:

> One long time Tweetbot feature is the ability to use any of your lists as your main timeline. To do this, all you have to do is hold down on the “Timeline” label in the navigation bar (in the timeline tab) and a menu populated with your lists will appear. Select one and that will become your current timeline. You can switch to another list or back to your main timeline any time by performing the same action.  
Even after reading this multiple times, it still was not obvious to me what it was talking about, and I was unable to find precisely *zero* visuals on The World Wide Web of this action taking place, so I recorded and uploaded [the video embedded above](https://youtu.be/IO-ZSD-vymc). Good God, how I wish I’d been a more detail-oriented young man! I’ll be privatizing my self-punishment from here on out, though, so bear with me.

The discourse surrounding Tapbots’ recent announcement has already reached a higher decibel count than I would have ever expected, so it’s obvious there are plenty of *users* who still [love Tweetbot](https://twitter.com/neoyokel/status/1064579914538602496), and you already know from the beforelinked stories that *The Verge* has also stood firmly by it as the preferred Twitter experience. It takes a wee bit of digging, though, to discover the subtle bets on both Tweetbots and Lists from no less than Apple, Inc., itself. In the official Apple Shortcuts Gallery, a curated list entitled “Twitter Better” includes “[Open Twitter Lists](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/161bb19df7ee47fa8b31a0c0fb43307b)” at number 1. In 5th position is “[Open in Tweetbot](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/c148d4f0dfbc45d6bf8bad6bb67d519c),” and “[Open in Twitter App](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/c45206139b9e47eb8de780e686350022)” (3rd,) is configured *by default* to first ask you to choose between Tweetbot and Twitter’s native app, despite its title.


![](TweetBot%206%20for%20iOS%20Review/sZXfdk8L.png)Tweetbot Bets in Shortcuts

As for App Store rankings, the fact that Tweetbot 5 was forcibly removed from public listings makes it impossible to meaningfully judge recent popularity of Tweetbot on iPhone/iPad. Its MacOS-based sibling, though (called Tweetbot 3,) was the *second most popular* paid app [on the Mac App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/tweetbot-3-for-twitter/id1384080005) as of [February 6th, 2020](https://i.snap.as/Uq8bRMF8.png). That’s the day I borrowed my Mom’s MacBook Pro for a short while to check up on MacOS Big Sur, when I downloaded the current version (3.5.2, if you wanted to know) of Tapbots’ desktop Twitter client and [messed around with it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=219&v=vHDNdMux16g) enough to tell you that it’s as wonderful as ever. (Had I not switched back to Windows as my primary desktop OS a decade ago, I would use it every single day.)


![](TweetBot%206%20for%20iOS%20Review/1bbw5iFH.png)Tweetbot 3 for MacOS Version 3.5.2

I suspect most active Twitter users in 2021 would be even more surprised to discover Tweetbot’s remaining, discreet hold on today’s Twitter experience than I was, assuming most of them joined more recently than myself and those I regularly interact with. For the sake of this Post, I reached out to Tapbots with an interview request about “Tweetbot’s roadmap, Apple’s requirement that [they] remove 5 from the App Store 30 days beforehand, and why [they’ve] decided to take this (risky, imo) bet on making our lives better,” though I don’t expect a reply, which is fine. They *did* respond to my support request regarding hardware keyboard shortcut support very quickly, saying they’ll look into it. (Without being verbose, I’ll just tell you that if a near future update to the app fixes the F and ⌘ + R
shortcuts, I *will* shit out my whole ass.)

## Present
Before I dig into the controversy and hypotheticals surrounding what Tweetbot 6 might become, let’s take a moment to qualify it vs all of one’s options to interact with Twitter on iOS *currently* (as in, Feb 11, 2021 at 19:24.) It’s almost certainly premature to do so, but skeptical readers would note, I’m sure, that its listing on the App Store is “early release” in name only, that I have just spent money on this specific version, which should therefore render inert the normal exceptions a review would make for beta or pre-release software.

## The Subscription Issue
For as long as I can remember, both the MacOS and iOS versions of Tweetbot have always possessed a more-or-less undefinable (perhaps Apple Development- specific) quality that’s noticeably set them apart from their direct competitors. I didn’t fully understand why they “feel” so much more “right” until I started making my way through this [list of all the interviews/podcast appearances](https://github.com/extratone/bilge/issues/59#issuecomment-778762784) by Tapbots’ iOS code wizard, [Paul Haddad](https://twitter.com/tapbot_paul), who comments in variations the same argument for a *very* deliberate developmental pace. The first time, with a *MacWorld* journalist on some steps outside WWDC 2013, I assumed he was just tossing some self-deprecation around to casualize the interview:

*Frankly, we’re slow at doing stuff.*

Yes, you are, Tapbot… From a returning user’s perspective, it’s hard to understand what in Gourd’s name they’ve been doing. I listened and read through every Tapbots interview I could find - all but one with Paul, who has through the years continued to come across as a sensitive, well-read, even *wise* professional developer with a healthy, professional outlook on the work of his little (relatively) weathered company and its place within the warp speed nightmare that is the mobile software industry. I suppose I was expecting to find an explanation for what I saw initially as a minimal regard for Tweetbot’s history, in contrast to 6’s announcement. I wouldn’t find it, though, because in truth, I was sure I already knew it: Twitter made it clear over a decade ago - just after they’d purchased Tweetie and slapped their own name on it - that they had no intention of competing in the client space, so [third-party developers were no longer welcome](https://www.macstories.net/stories/twitter-to-developers-enough-with-the-twitter-clients/).

> Developers have told us that they’d like more guidance from us about the best opportunities to build on Twitter.  More specifically, developers ask us if they should build client apps that mimic or reproduce the mainstream Twitter consumer client experience. The answer is no.As we point out above, we need to move to a less fragmented world, where every user can experience Twitter in a consistent way.  
I’ve spent enough time in The App Space (read: Phone Dude Hell) to expect a lot of melodrama, largely without judgement, considering how generally awful the big vendors have made the whole situation. The business legality of the story was [spiked into the mainstream conversation](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/19/opinion/apple-app-store-hey.html) last year by [controversy](https://reddit.com/r/extratown/comments/hbncn6/news_surrounding_hey_the_upcoming_email_service/) encouraged by Basecamp following some pretty toxic, retaliatory correspondence from Apple regarding their plan to subsidize their new email service, HEY. Frankly, I’ve found such stories - about clashes between big software companies over mediocre, uninspiring, and sometimes just downright *bad* software - ridiculously exhausting and less and less interesting, lately, as I’ve realized that the most innovative, quality work I have experienced has basically all come from the tiniest teams. The most groundbreaking projects and products I’ve bothered to show and tell, here - [Unichar](https://bilge.world/unichar-for-ios-app-review), [Zalgo Generator](https://bilge.world/zalgo-generator-ios-app-review), [Bear](https://bilge.world/poweruser-tips-software-shortcuts), [Toot!](https://youtu.be/LdBFMibyh3Y), [Mastonaut](https://youtu.be/k7KDk-VV6wc), [Mast](https://youtu.be/8Sss0gzpoeQ), etc. - were all built by individual developers except for Shiny Frog’s Bear. (Their team currently numbers 16, by my count.) Each one of those hyperlinks eventually leads to a form of my same rant: **why the fuck won’t tech media talk about genuine innovation anymore**.

> I personally hate that question because, you know… it just will get done when it gets done… We’re definitely slow. We go over every screen, every detail over and over again until we get it right. That takes time, which is why we don’t talk about upcoming projects.

> For the iPhone, the overarching theme is that they're finally letting it get complicated.

* A slick means of turning single Tweets, Threads, Moments, individual replies, etc into images just like Apollo’s ingenious super-configurable method of generating images of various Reddit content. A few poignant observations factor into this suggestion:

1. The *only* Tweet embeds that have survived any time on the web, whatsoever with any real dignity are those that were simply screenshotted. It took myself far too many years of ceaseless fiddling to finally realize this when I began digging through Internet History for context on stories like Tweetbot’s. When Twitter embeds *have* managed to last any significant screen time on the web, I’ve never observed it accomplished with any dignity, anyway. Think about how much time you’ve observed spent on API development just for the sake of compatible, adaptable, yet fundamentally inert blue and white brand boxes rudely dictating terms and bully residents in *your house*, only to disintegrate minutes later and disappear into dust, having satisfied not a single one of their promises.

# Siri, Discreet, Sweetest Idiot
## While I cannot *justify* Siri’s lack of progress, I might be able to sufficiently *explain* it.

# Mark Fuck and the Goofy Godheads | The Psalms

Today, after positing on whether or not a pastry was in fact the namesake of the battleship *Bismarck*, I was told by its owner – a local woman of a far-from-excusable age – that “[I] should be on that big bang show.” Upon such fuckery, I looked her in her eyes and informed her that she'd just changed my plans for the night: I was now going to go home, wrap my lips around the barrel of my Beretta, and blow my brains out. I should've known better than to so jest with a boomer immediately after receiving such glaring indicators of minimal intellectual function, but I fell for the hope – as I often do, to no avail – that such a jarring reaction would encourage reflection on her foul, tragically misled sentiments regarding the general state of youth, and perhaps even spare a peer or two from future tribulation.

Instead, she called the police.

Three round cops found me, an hour later, approaching hesitantly. Strangely enough, they were chuckling – maybe to a little joke about all the recent hubbub on the radio covering a recent wave of blatantly negligent medical care in American prisons, though I hope nervous laughter is just *SOP* when responding to a suicide threat. As all Columbia cops always are toward me, they were aggravatingly genuine and hilariously understanding. I began by simply recreating my interaction with their summoner, quoting her word-for-word, and – I swear to my new Lord – all three immediately released a choral “ohhhhh” in unison. I'll never know for sure if they actually assimilated the reality of the situation so quickly, but it'd certainly seem that way.

Clearly, I should've threatened *her* life.

Despite the day-to-day expression of our recurring wisdoms, habits, instincts, patterns and cycles of cultural metamorphosis in the discourse, the stream of “well, you know they were sayin' the world was going to end when *I* was in elementary school” to my ear has fallen abruptly silent since the inauguration. Our parents and grandparents are both impossibly fortunate and unfortunate, having to duck out as the most multiplicative (read: sickest) cerebral orgy in the history of mankind will just've begun nibbling on the slope to its climax. We'll be lucky if we'll still be able to articulate our goodbyes by the time they reach the door. Nonsense does a fuckin number on perceived wisdom, but the gaps *are* widening at a dangerous pace. Tectonic or domestic, we are all straddling expanding space, and the chill of its draft is now stealing too much of our heat to ignore.

Though it is entertaining in the moment (and otherwise redundant,) it would not be *well-to-do* of me now – nor was it, then – to leave the conversation in edgy absurdity. Yes, a part of me would like to campaign for *Sheldon* to be reclassified as an expletive, in disgust, but – as an adult in all-out sprint to make up for stalled emotional development – I must note that such a display of concern should've been at least reciprocated with a bit of explanation, if not appreciation. Still, there are much more appropriate reasons and situations in which to waste public servants' time.

It's not news – the *Theory* is providing *some* ghoulishly skewed portrayal of less-than-forty pseudointellectuals. Obviously, my savior's time was worth very little to her, but the fact that she spent any quantity of anything at all engaging with even a decidedly mainstream generationally ambassadorial bridge could be regarded – if stretched – as the result of a curious seed, which has skyrocketed in human value, as of late. It is undiscouragable. Read the trail a bit, and you'll find that your frustration is simply an expression of the terror that's ignited by the stagnancy of their pace.

*It's great that you've managed to inch over to modern-ish sitcoms from Judge Judy and* Independence Day *, mom, but you're gonna have to* ***really pick up the pace*** *and work on following a few body modification communities on the darknet.*

If an absence of *solutions* are the crux of the *blog*, here I'm now gloating.

To whom does the commoner look to for such solutions when they'd prefer not to terrorize their kooky middle age parents into a half century of brutal fasting under vows of silence?

The Big Thinkers! The Men of the Hour.

Yes, *men.* All Big Bumbling Billionaire Imbeciles.

Elon Musk *cannot* be the Nicola Tesla of the 21st century, or even the *20th*, for that matter, because literally *every* mechanically-minded professional I've ever heard talk about battery technology has condemned it in some manner as an inescapable dead end, developmentally. Perhaps, then, the champion of electrochemical storage is *the* False Prophet.

No, I'm not capable of citing research or conjuring Mars-capable spacecraft, but I've been a bit too preoccupied with my country's class war and its [10% adult illiteracy rate](http://bit.ly/unescoliteracy). It's all well and good to be privy to romanticism, but it's not the 1960s anymore. Even Howard Hughes would be more concerned for the wellness of the species than our continued reach for the stars, were he still alive.

Well. Maybe not...

Charles Lindbergh would be, though.

We spent the 1990s preparing to rid ourselves of history because the smartest among us foresaw some facsimile of the renaissance we are currently experiencing. If they'd been shown a glimpse of [some statistics](http://bit.ly/measuringconsumerinfo) on the volume of media we consume, they'd exclaim of their pride – no doubt – in their species' capability to progress, and perhaps even their own contribution to it. However, extended observation of an average American's day-to-day life would be lamented, in disgust, and a [huge portion](http://bit.ly/millennialspew) of the blame can be placed on one t-shirt-touting cyberyokel: Mark Zuckerberg.

His name is stupid, his spawn is ruining my life, and he continues to insist upon saying shit that frightens the bejesus out of me.

[Zuckbrain](https://backchannel.com/we-are-entering-the-era-of-the-brain-machine-interface-75a3a1a37fd3) is fucking scary.

“ [Wiring the globe](http://bit.ly/zuckfuck) ” is fucking scary.

[Jarvis](http://bit.ly/zuckbot) is fucking scary.

But Fuck, himself wouldn't be at all intimidating without his money. The scariest bit is the lack of *class* in the criticisms of his intellectual influence. Farhad Manjoo's [attention](http://bit.ly/fuckbug) has been diligent and premium as a *Times* er's should be, but the same occupation bars him from authoring with the color of unsubstantiated claims.

Mine does not.

Elon Musk is not an apologetic genius. He's willing to [joke](http://bit.ly/aloofmusk) about his intellectual distance from the planet and its populace on Twitter. Apparently, his mind's even surpassed the need to punctuate. Crazy.

Google is well on it's way to becoming the neo-Vatican... yada yada yada, but they're too far gone – I do not have the expertise to address them. Fuck, though, is a singular short-sleeved, *Even Stevens* -haired young man [without](http://bit.ly/crowdfuck) so much as private office space (even though his sentiments on breathing room at home are [obviously inverse](http://bit.ly/fuckflex).)

Clearly, it's all just to protect him from the truth: **The Apostle John's** ***Book of Revelation*** **is about Facebook**. Fuck's cyberchild is the horseman, the beasts, *and* the plagues, stuffed into one tyrannical website.

> And the smoke of their torment ascendeth up for ever and ever: and they have no rest day nor night, who worship the beast and his image, and whosoever receiveth the mark of his name.  
If I can *repeatedly* trigger accidental voice calls on Fuckbook Messenger, don't tell me it's not possible to inadvertently live stream myself on the pot.

> The beast that thou sawest was, and is not; and shall ascend out of the bottomless pit, and go into perdition: and they that dwell on the earth shall wonder, whose names were not written in the book of life from the foundation of the world, when they behold the beast that was, and is not, and yet is.  
Of course, it's unlikely that Mark's essence was bred entirely of evil, but – like Tump, in many ways – he is an excruciatingly wealthy idiot. Though he *is* spending 2017 touring the United States, he [doesn't seem](http://bit.ly/fucklearning) to be all that interested in *actually* closing the gap between himself and the rest of us, which suggests that he only wants us to throw us off his extra-terrestrial, xenophobic scent. I can't imagine what *The Mothership* would really want with my Amazon browsing history, though.

> And another angel came out of the temple, crying with a loud voice to him that sat on the cloud, Thrust in thy sickle, and reap: for the time is come for thee to reap; for the harvest of the earth is ripe.  
Just to be clear, **he is not** ***The Antikhristos***.

He'd better not be, anyway. I'd be absolutely Livid with Lucifer if his choice of a figurehead for his Big Plan was such a Fucking dork.

I mean... if Fuck wanted to spend his time crafting 6000-word essays, why the Fuck didn't he just build a Fucking CMS back in his Jesse Eisenberg era instead of *the actual* weekly-updated tower of digital Babylon? Surely, Satan would know better than to waste resources and pulverize creativity by ordering his Demonic Dev team to release regular builds for build's sake rather than on a per-need basis, but that'd be because The Tempter is an authority on *incentive* s as thoroughly as Fuck isn't.

If you’re equipped with the privilege of literacy, you’ve been reading a lot about Fuckbook’s political consequences, recently. Frankly, *it’s about Fucking time*, but I’m compelled to emphasize that the most significant motor driving the politik is fueled by the eldest, fossilized portions of our thought meat. According to Manjoo, “the News Feed team’s ultimate mission is to figure out what users want,” dipping in Facebook's ocean of action data, searching for a soul.

Yet another Fuckism that suggests he's an alien: everybody knows that *nobody* knows what they want.

There's a central mechanic of our brains that by nature wreaks a whole helluva lot of contradiction. If you've ever mentioned ADHD with your doctor, or know a hypochondriac/adderall fiend who has, you may have heard it described as “the lizard brain.” Simply put, it's the brain stem, and it's responsible for the most basal and primitively emotional instincts and habits; an anti-intellectual agitant, arguing at all times for the course of action with the most immediate gratification. *The Great Clickbait War* of 2013 was a startling demonstration that revealed the strength of the hold Fuckbook had (and still has) on these reptilian bits – the true location of its power.

“In surveys, people kept telling Facebook that they hated teasing headlines. But if that was true, why were they clicking on them?”

*Volition* is the Word of the Day. Here, we must once again invoke an ancient parable from the wise foretellings of the Disney film, *Smart House*: **when dealing with human beings, boundless compliance quickly leads to abject misery for all parties involved.**

Mindlessly, habitually, endlessly clicking... **this is how we die**.

Something about Fuck's direction is fundamentally poisonous to the human mind. Yes, he *is* assuredly too Fucking democratic, but misinformation is far from the only form of evil his creation has assumed. If you can jog your memory back a bit, you'll remember a much wider variety of brain-rotting filth.

In lapses of their existences' finitude, the 40-something second cousins of the world may still send you the occasional *Can Crunch Saga* invite, jarring you back to Jr. High in 2009, and forever associating themselves in your mind with the horrors of mortality and **f u c k b o o k g a m e s.**

Elon is a more likely candidate, but I'll leave those differentiations to the not-idle cult masses.

More than one sixth of all living eyes [see](https://newsroom.fb.com/company-info/) Fuckbook every single day, placing its consumption behind only eating and drinking as the most universally human activity.

Mr. Fuck achieved his vision and became perhaps the greatest purveyor of words who's ever lived. He's taught (or... is teaching) us something very profound about ourselves: capability is not the whole of the equation. Ability on its own cannot guarantee growth, but it can often result in decay. Discussion does not inherently lead to *connection*. Population is not a cure for isolation.

That said, I must begrudgingly admit to you that I, myself am one of the 100 million users who've depended upon a “very meaningful” Fuckbook group for a “physical support structure” for which I have Fuck to thank.

I've spent half of my existence watching cheesy barnstorming movies, whirling around die-cast biplanes, seeking out stories from old pilots – military and commercial, and eventually trained to become one myself. As regular activities at young ages do, aviation became deeply ingrained into my identity, but my local community is *very* sparse – it's not exactly *cool*, these days. On Fuckbook, an unofficial group for members of the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association has allowed me to stay connected to the rest of the world's Soaring Nerds, which is no small deal. It's the only forum which I am compelled to participate in with 100% sincerity and emotional effect.

Photos of members standing proudly next to their first airplane, or of adolescent students in a similar pose after their first solo, or of three old white rubes on a hangar picnic, laughing around a fold-up table full of rudimentary ham sandwiches in front of two gleaming Stearmans...

They tug around on my heart like nothing else in life can.

I stopped flying lessons at 16 because I began to see behind the naivety of my childhood perception of what it meant to fly commercially and realized that I was unequipped for- and uninterested in the sort of challenges it presented. I haven't flown in seven years, but the community will *always* have a tremendous dividend of my core being.

These days, not a single person in my day-to-day life knows or cares about aviation, which wouldn't be laudable whatsoever – it's not exactly the most relevant goingson at the moment – were it not so *emotionally* necessary for me.

A few days ago, a member shared a photo with the group of Charles Lindbergh's modified Ryan cockpit, captioned “what airplane am I?”

In my youth, Lindbergh filled my closest equivalent to the 'childhood hero' role. My grandmother bought me a first-edition copy of *The Spirit of St.Louis* from a small town bookshop when I was six or seven, and I carried it *literally everywhere* with me until middle school. I watched the Jimmy Stewart film tens and tens of times, and I cried when I saw the *Spirit* in the flesh at the Smithsonian, yet I've *never* had an informed conversation about any of it with another human being. It really warmed me to see how many of the comments were correct answers.

Breaking news: it's nice to know that there are other people on Earth who give a shit about the same things you do.

Again – aspiration should always be encouraged. This is Fuck's vision for his creation, and it *is* feasible, even for myself. At least his public persona – however valid or invalid it may be – is making a huge effort to have positive consequence, even if his idiocy is imbuing itself within all of humanity.

Fuck is too powerful to be exempted from responsibility for what Fuckbook's done to the Western psyche over the past decade, but – like the Christian god – perhaps all we need require is his repentance.

# Underdocumented Maneuvers in iOS
## Peep this dope listicle of iPhone Pro Tips
It became most apparent during my research for my iPhone 12 Pro Max Review that Apple’s mobile operating system and all that it entails has changed profoundly over the course of its history even moreso than is immediately obvious. The operating system that thwarted the very idea of the Power User currently has numerous features that were added explicitly for them. (One might suggest this really began in iOS 12, with [Siri Shortcuts](http://bilge.world/siri-shortcuts-ios12-review).) The trouble is that many of these features overlap into what the most average user might use in their day-to-day operation of their handsets and tablets. Showing timestamps in iMessage, for instance, is a function which one should not have to stumble upon or take to an internet search to find. (Swipe from right to left in a conversation.) Little functions like this are incredibly poorly documented, considering iOS is maintained by the most valuable company in the history of the world.
Apple does make an effort to educate new users, mainly through the [Tips app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/tips/id1069509450), which has indeed become more useful and insightful over time, but still leaves a whole lot to be desired. They also publish an owner’s manual-esque *[iPhone Users Guide](https://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewBook?id=1515995528)*, which is unfortunately completely inaccessible in any format outside of the native Books app. (I made a not-insignificant effort to convert the volume to a PDF for your sake, but found myself completely defeated by DRM, hilariously.) Some of the functions listed in this post are accompanied by links to Apple Support web pages, but far too many have no such entries, which - from my perspective - is absolutely inexcusable on Apple’s part. Inexcusable, but perhaps not inexplicable.
It would seem that the vast ecosystem of both professional and amateur technology media which reports on iOS has inadvertently filled in for Apple in the role of documentarian. Search YouTube for “iPhone Tips” and you’ll manifest a multitude of results with titles like *[16 ACTUAL iPhone Tricks You Didn’t Know Existed!](https://youtu.be/YKOY6-ZdUo8)* which haphazardly (and often distastefully) do the company’s job for them.

# Track Changes Amazon Review
The [longest Amazon review at the time of this writing](https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1ASHU52UE8SDX/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0674417070), by Armando Fox, insists from its title that this book is for a "niche audience," but - perhaps I'm just severely out of touch - the most surprising bit of the experience was just how diverse and widely-applicable Word Processing history was/is. Like Armando, I would also call myself "an aficionado of both computing history and the history of the written and printed word," but I believe the relevance to the latter of these subjects should extend *Track Changes*' audience far beyond what one would first assume. "Does word processing belong to the history of writing or the history of computing? The answer is not obvious," notes Kirschenbaum in his Preface. I believe those interested in either should consider it **required reading**.

To those like myself who are particularly interested in word processors and their history, I say **buy this book immediately** as a given. I can't remember the last time I was so elated to have found such a book, largely out of relief, for I was beginning to think I would have to write it myself.

The volume of published reviews of this book - and the diversity of the publications that carried them - will surprise you. I set out to gather them all in one space, and found the task quite huge.

There *is* some drudgery, yes - extensive details on IBM's interworkings in the 1970s, perhaps - but Kirschenbaum does an excellent job at being thorough without inappropriate tedium. To call it *dull* would be a critique of the story, itself, rather than his writing.

# Capturing Stereo Audio from Built-In Microphones
Configure an iOS device’s built-in microphones to add stereo recording capabilities to your app.

## Overview
Stereo audio uses two channels to create the illusion of multidirectional sound, adding greater depth and dimension to your audio and resulting in an immersive listening experience. iOS provides a number of ways to record audio from the built-in microphones, but until now it's been limited to mono audio only. Starting in iOS 14 and iPadOS 14, you can now capture stereo audio using the built-in microphones on supported devices.

Because a user can hold an iOS device in a variety of ways, you need to specify the orientation of the right and left channels in the stereo field. Set the built-in microphone’s directionality by configuring:
* Polar pattern. The system represents the individual device microphones, and beamformers that use multiple microphones, as data sources. Select the front or back data source and set its polar pattern to stereo.
* Input orientation. When recording video, set the input orientation to match the video orientation. When recording audio only, set the input orientation to match the user interface orientation. In both cases, don’t change the orientation during recording.

This sample app shows how to configure your app to record stereo audio, and helps you visualize changes to the input orientation and data-source selection.

* Note: You must run the sample on a supported physical device running iOS 14, or later. To determine whether a device supports stereo recording, query the audio session’s selected data source to see if its [supportedPolarPatterns](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation/avaudiosessiondatasourcedescription/1616450-supportedpolarpatterns) array contains the [stereo](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation/avaudiosession/polarpattern/3551726-stereo) polar pattern.

## Configure the Audio Session Category
Recording stereo audio requires the app’s audio session to use either the [record](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation/avaudiosession/category/1616451-record) or [playAndRecord](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation/avaudiosession/category/1616568-playandrecord) category. The sample uses the `playAndRecord` category so it can do both. It also passes the `defaultToSpeaker` and `allowBluetooth` options to route the audio to the speaker instead of the receiver, and to Bluetooth headphones.

```swift
func setupAudioSession() {
    do {
        let session = AVAudioSession.sharedInstance()
        try session.setCategory(.playAndRecord, options: [.defaultToSpeaker, .allowBluetooth])
        try session.setActive(true)
    } catch {
        fatalError("Failed to configure and activate session.")
    }
}
```
[View in Source](x-source-tag://SetupAudioSession)

## Select and Configure a Built-In Microphone
An iOS device’s built-in microphone input consists of an array of physical microphones and beamformers, each represented as an instance of `AVAudioSessionDataSourceDescription`. The sample app finds the built-in microphone input by querying the available inputs for the one where the port type equals the built-in microphone, and sets it as the preferred input.

```swift
private func enableBuiltInMic() {
    // Get the shared audio session.
    let session = AVAudioSession.sharedInstance()
    
    // Find the built-in microphone input.
    guard let availableInputs = session.availableInputs,
          let builtInMicInput = availableInputs.first(where: { $0.portType == .builtInMic }) else {
        print("The device must have a built-in microphone.")
        return
    }
    
    // Make the built-in microphone input the preferred input.
    do {
        try session.setPreferredInput(builtInMicInput)
    } catch {
        print("Unable to set the built-in mic as the preferred input.")
    }
}
```
[View in Source](x-source-tag://EnableBuiltInMic)

## Configure the Microphone Input’s Directionality
To configure the microphone input’s directionality, the sample sets its data source’s preferred polar pattern and the session’s input orientation. It performs this configuration in its `selectRecordingOption(_:orientation)`  method, which it calls whenever the user rotates the device or changes the recording option selection.

```swift
func selectRecordingOption(_ option: RecordingOption, orientation: Orientation, completion: (StereoLayout) -> Void) {
    
    // Get the shared audio session.
    let session = AVAudioSession.sharedInstance()
    
    // Find the built-in microphone input's data sources,
    // and select the one that matches the specified name.
    guard let preferredInput = session.preferredInput,
          let dataSources = preferredInput.dataSources,
          let newDataSource = dataSources.first(where: { $0.dataSourceName == option.dataSourceName }),
          let supportedPolarPatterns = newDataSource.supportedPolarPatterns else {
        completion(.none)
        return
    }
    
    do {
        isStereoSupported = supportedPolarPatterns.contains(.stereo)
        // If the data source supports stereo, set it as the preferred polar pattern.
        if isStereoSupported {
            // Set the preferred polar pattern to stereo.
            try newDataSource.setPreferredPolarPattern(.stereo)
        }

        // Set the preferred data source and polar pattern.
        try preferredInput.setPreferredDataSource(newDataSource)
        
        // Update the input orientation to match the current user interface orientation.
        try session.setPreferredInputOrientation(orientation.inputOrientation)

    } catch {
        fatalError("Unable to select the \(option.dataSourceName) data source.")
    }
    
    // Call the completion handler with the updated stereo layout.
    completion(StereoLayout(orientation: newDataSource.orientation!,
                            stereoOrientation: session.inputOrientation))
}
```
[View in Source](x-source-tag://SelectDataSource)

This method finds the data source with the selected name, sets its preferred polar pattern to stereo, and then sets it as the input’s preferred data source. Finally, it sets the preferred input orientation to match the device’s user interface orientation.

The app I have the most experience with a Tweetbot and you've given me a whole new love for Twitter that I never knew was there I'm at I really do you know will assess later on and on your website you say you're not moving to other platforms but I've had so much love to see a Mac up for T-ball and I just pray that like when I ask you to supersede your question that's what you talk about math I'm in love with I know you can actually have a love affair with an application or a piece of offer but you have done an awesome job with Tweetbot.

> Thank you thank you yeah we probably won't be talking about any super secret project not so much because we don't want to give anything away but because if we do talk about whatever supersecret projects we have going on and people continuously ask us when it's going to be done and I personally hate that question because you know I will just will get done when it gets done and so will probably not talk much about you know what we got going on but it will be interesting else I'll say that I do love that the part on your website where you say a little bit of patience please I wanna be blunt here we're slow I just love that you're honest about that yeah no we're definitely yeah we're slow we go over every screen every detail and you know over and over again until we get it right and that takes time and that's why we don't really like to talk about upcoming projects because we honestly don't know when it's going to be done will you know will be done when it's done and that's kind of the good thing about him not being our own boss is like we don't have to we don't set deadlines and I mean we set general deadlines of like when we like it to be done but you know if somethings not done it we don't have to rush it we're gonna just keep working on until it's ready.

# Tweetbot for iPhone Review | MacStories

I remember when I bought my first iPhone, Twittelator was the first Twitter client I downloaded from the App Store. Back then I wasn’t writing for MacStories, and I didn’t know about Loren Brichter’s Tweetie. I used Twittelator for months: it was a great app that had everything I needed. I saw no point in switching to another application, let alone start browsing the App Store looking for alternatives. Twitter was a young platform in the middle of expansion with lots of downtime issues, there were no lists or location features and the concept of “retweets” was just taking off thanks to the initiative of some users not affiliated with Twitter at all. For what I had to do, Twittelator was fine. Then I started MacStories, and the hunt for more compelling, alternative, different Twitter apps began.

Twitterrific came after Twittelator for me. I used it for a couple of months and then finally purchased Tweetie – which had seen a terrific rise in popularity thanks to an elegant UI design, a fast engine and a simple, yet powerful set of features. I fell in love with Tweetie: it was stable, fast, intuitive, continually updated. It received the support [of the entire Apple community](http://www.flickr.com/photos/apoltix/3614598843/), and it quickly became a standard among iPhone geeks to have Tweetie on a device’s homescreen. The rest is history: Tweetie 2 shipped and revolutionized the ecosystem with pull to refresh, gestures, a refreshed interface and, overall, the richest feature set available on the market. In the meantime, Twitter as a platform was growing to accommodate more users, more servers and – as a side effect to media starting to use the service to deliver news – more responsibilities. Without going back through all the changes that happened at Twitter HQ between 2009 and 2010, you might remember when the company announced [they were buying Loren Brichter’s Tweetie](http://www.macstories.net/news/twitter-acquires-tweetie-becomes-twitter-for-iphone-soon-free-in-the-app-store/) and putting him in the position of lead mobile developer. Twitter rebranded the app as “Twitter for iPhone”, Tweetie 2 for Mac disappeared from our radars to eventually [come back as Twitter for Mac](http://www.macstories.net/reviews/twitter-for-mac-review-love-it-hate-it-tweet-it/). Twitter as a *company* has changed (so much that they don’t even want [too many unofficial clients anymore](http://www.macstories.net/stories/twitter-to-developers-enough-with-the-twitter-clients/) ), but the core concept of the *service* stays the same: it’s all about sharing content in real time. That hasn’t changed at all. If anything, it got better.

This is why I’m looking back at the 2008 - 2010 period with a bit of nostalgia mixed with excitement for what’s next: the developer community has always driven Twitter’s innovation on mobile platforms. Twittelator, Twitterrific, Birdbrain, Tweetie, Osfoora, Tweet Library: these are some of the great apps that have changed the way we check on Twitter with our iPhones and iPads, and have created new uses and interfaces for a service that was initially meant for sharing short status messages. You can’t say this for many companies nowadays, but third-party developers have been the greatest contribution to Twitter in the past three years.

On the other end of the spectrum, there’s the personal aspect of the story. As Twitter was growing in 2009 and 2010, so was this website. Of course I’m not trying to compare Twitter’s growth to MacStories’ one – that would be silly – but I’m saying *I was there* when all those clients started coming out in the App Store, when Tweetie 2.0 was released, when Twitter launched [its criticized iPad app](http://www.macstories.net/ipad/twitter-for-ipad-review/). Those are pretty big milestones in the history of technology, moments of innovation that a bad ranking on Google Search can’t take away from us. I have installed dozens of Twitter apps, I have seen developers struggling to come up with the right features at the right time, or the best design to appeal new users in a market that was getting crowded very quickly. And you know, there are actual people behind the indie Twitter apps we usually cover – not faceless companies looking for easy funding and a solid exit strategy. From a blogger’s perspective, the adoption of Twitter clients and the rise of Twitter as a real time communication service are quite possibly the most notable changes that happened in the tech scene in the recent years.

But as the timestamps on our tweets teach us, stuff in the real-time world gets old in a matter of minutes. And when something gets old and fails at keeping our attention span active, it’s time to make room for the new. But make no mistake: if there’s anything I’ve learned from iOS developers, it’s that innovation doesn’t stem from a “New & Noteworthy” label in the App Store. Shipping a new product isn’t a proxy for innovation. It takes a lot of ideas, willingness to change the rules and, most of all, a real “leap of faith” to release something you’re not sure it’s ever going to catch on, but you feel in your heart and tired coding fingers was worth the effort.

Innovation comes from the stubborns that don’t accept what’s been given to them.

Innovation is a big word when it comes to Twitter clients. The market has been saturated by thousands of copycats that don’t add any new functionality to Twitter as a platform or service for iOS devices; the official applications are generally fine for average users who are looking for a way to tweet from their iPhones and iPads and Macs. Being an innovator in the mobile Twitter scene today means being able to disrupt what’s already available. I can understand why that could be a risk not so many devs are willing to take, especially considering Twitter’s aforementioned update regarding third-party clients. It’s a tough call.

You may be wondering why I’ve already written 900 words to introduce you to the latest application from [Tapbots](http://tapbots.com/), makers of App Store hits like Pastebot and Convertbot. I mean, it’s not a secret that I’ve been testing [Tweetbot](http://tapbots.com/software/tweetbot/) over the past months and that Mark Jardine and Paul Haddad were working on a Twitter app for iPhone. But I believe sometimes a proper introduction is needed, just like a beautiful landscape needs to be admired and examined before a shot. In the case of Twitter clients, looking back at the platform’s history is necessary.

Innovation is a risk. True excellence, on the other hand, is exclusive to those who took risks in the past and know what they’re facing now, when a new risk comes forward.

Tweetbot is the app I’ve been waiting for: an excellent innovator of the Twitter platform. My new favorite Twitter client.

There’s a lot to do in [Tweetbot](http://tapbots.com/software/tweetbot/), and several features to talk about. After months of development and testing in a private beta group, Tapbots has managed to release the most complete and functional Twitter client currently available on the App Store – a powerful application that is Tapbots’ take on the whole Twitter experience. You can think of Tweetbot as Pastebot applied to your timeline: a beautiful app that shines on the Retina Display thanks to Mark Jardine’s usual attention to pixels and taste, combined with a set of functionalities and new ideas that make Tweetbot the most innovative and disruptive Twitter app for iOS I’ve seen since Tweetie 2 came out years ago. I’m not afraid to call Tweetbot the “best Twitter client available for iPhone”, as in these weeks spent testing it I’ve noticed a clear improvement in the way I can access and read Twitter from my iPhone, as well as being able to get actual work done on it.

## Settings
So let’s start from the main screen. Tweetbot allows you to set up multiple Twitter accounts, and switch between them from the same page – which also contains a Settings tab to customize your Tweetbot experience and the various sharing options implemented by Tapbots. Adding a new Twitter account doesn’t take you to an embedded Twitter web view, you just have to enter your username and password and wait for the app to authenticate you. One little touch I’m sure a very few people have noticed so far: if you enter the wrong username or password, the login popup will “fall” off screen. Try it. It’s this attention to detail that make Tweetbot a great app.

The Settings are organized in General preferences that apply to every section of the app, and account-specific settings that you can tweak and customize for each account you’ve added in Tweetbot. I want to start from the Settings as I believe Tapbots has nailed this aspect of the app by providing many options that enable you to deeply personalize the experience, and make your Tweetbot different from someone else’s – especially when it comes to touch gestures and sound effects. First off, Tweetbot can post tweets in the background: if you leave this preference set to “off”, Tweetbot’s new tweet window will stay on screen until a tweet is posted. But if you activate it, you’ll be able to instantly return to the timeline or whatever window you’re in after you’ve pressed the Send button. What’s the benefit? Simple: when you’re uploading media like videos and photos, the posting process might take a while. With background posting, Tweetbot gets out of the way, does its job in the background so you can keep interacting with the app while a tweet is being processed. Other options in the General settings include sounds, font size, display name, and triple tap preferences.

So here’s what Tweetbot is doing to be the “innovative client” I described above: instead of simply relying on graphics to visually communicate the status of the timeline and your interactions with tweets and users, Tweetbot makes great use of sound effects to let you know when a tweet has been posted, when new ones have arrived, or when you’ve successfully retweeted something. It may sound strange at first, but sounds add a whole new layer to Tweetbot – think of [Pastebot’s](http://tapbots.com/software/pastebot/) sound notifications for copy and paste actions and you get the basic idea. Yet in Tweetbot almost everything was given a proper sound effect, and quality is top notch. In the sound settings, you’re given the option to choose whether you want effects for all actions, notifications only, or nothing. Why are sound effects such a big deal? Because I’ve found myself instantly recognizing what was going on in the app without even looking. I can scroll my timeline, hit retweet on something, keep scrolling and a few seconds later hear a sound effect and think “Hey, that retweet went through.” Again: it’s all about the details, and rethinking interaction schemes to innovate a platform that’s been stagnant for too long.

I appreciate the fact that you can set font sizes and display users as real names, but I want to focus on tap actions. Like in Twitterrific for iOS, you can perform a triple tap on a tweet to *do something*. In Tweetbot, you can configure this triple tap to mark a tweet as favorite, initiate a reply, retweet, or translate. I keep mine set to “mark as favorite”, and I love it.

Last, there are the account settings. In this window you can basically select all the additional services you want to use with your Twitter account, and Tweetbot has a great selection of URL shorteners, image / video upload websites and read later services to choose from. Instapaper and Read It Later are supported, but there’s no Readability integration yet. For video upload, you can choose between Mobypicture, TwitVid and yfrog. Mobypicture and yfrog also work as image services, with the addition of img.ly (which I use), Plixi, Twitgoo and TwitPic. In the URL shortening section, you can log in with your CloudApp account (my favorite), bit.ly (no authentication), goo.gl, is.gd, j.mp, Linkyy, l.pr and TinyURL. If you select a URL shortening service, all the links you post in Tweetbot will be automatically shortened.

And that’s it for the Settings. Like I said Tapbots worked really hard to get as many options as possible out in the first version, and expect more coming in future updates. Right now, these settings help a lot in customizing how Tweetbot works for you, but it’s when you get to the app’s timeline that you notice why Tweetbot is, indeed, different.

Let me get back to the subject of taking risks for a minute: how do you break the rules and conventions in a Twitter client for iPhone, a well-established category that hasn’t seen real innovations since the inception of swipe actions and pull to refresh? By **building on** those innovations, and trying to come up with something new that can “fix” the issues many people had with Twitter apps in the past. At the same time, you have to make sure your product is still accessible and easy to use, because new features added for the sake of being original at all costs can turn out to a terrible idea. This was the risk – the challenge Tapbots had to accept. And with the final product in our hands today, I have to admit the Twitter experience offered by Tweetbot is perfect. At least for me, I haven’t seen any other app that’s so well executed, beautiful, fast and useful for what I have to do with Twitter.

## Timeline & Actions
Tweetbot’s timeline is based on three key features: lists, gestures, and actions. Together with these features, there are dozens of additional touches like pull to refresh, timeline resume and customizable tabs that are the proverbial icing on the cake. In Tweetbot, any Twitter list can become your main timeline in two taps. With a button in top toolbar that separates the “back” and “new tweet” buttons, you can access all your private / public lists you’ve created or subscribed to and make them a timeline that will replace the people you follow until you select the main Timeline again. Let’s say I want to temporarily switch to a timeline based on a list collecting people that tweet about RIM: I tap on the timeline button, select the list, and there my main timeline is replaced by the RIM folks. I can go back at any time, choose lists – even create new ones and add users to them thanks to Tweetbot’s full list management. Other Twitter clients in the past tried to play around with this concept of turning lists into timelines, but none of them got close to today’s implementation in Tweetbot. It’s simple, fun, and adds value to my productivity.

The timeline is organized in tabs: people you follow, replies, direct messages, and two customizable tabs. Instead of putting a tab for favorite tweets and then an obscure “More” tab to let you navigate between other sections like most Twitter clients do nowadays, Tapbots created a system that allows you to access **4 sections using 2 tabs**. Once you try it, it’s genius: the last two tabs in the bottom bar have little arrows next to the main icon, which means these tabs can be “expanded” to reveal more sections. So let’s say Tweetbot defaults my fourth tab to Favorites but I want to put Lists in there, all I have to do is tap & hold the tab, and choose lists (or the third item, retweets). It’s a tiny, translucent menu that contains icons for the additional sections you might want to open and – guess what – it’s got its own sound effect as well. In my opinion, this is incredibly better than having a More tab [to manually customize the contents of the tab bar](http://www.macstories.net/links/iphone-tab-bar-lessons/) – Tweetbot has 5 tabs, but they’re virtually 9. Also, the selected tab has a pressed state, and a blue highlight to indicate new tweets or direct messages. It looks great, it works equally well. Direct messages can be marked as read with a double tap, and they’re presented in threaded conversation views. Thumbs up.

To quickly scroll to the top of the timeline, you can tap on the iOS status bar as you would expect from any iPhone app. But as you do that, you might notice something different about Tweetbot’s timeline. First, there’s a search field above the first tweet that enables you to filter down status updates based on specific keywords. If you keep scrolling up, you will stumble upon Tweetbot’s version of the mythical pull to refresh gesture: it’s got a spinning blue indicator that visually tells you what’s going on, and a timestamp with the last time you’ve refreshed the timeline. When the timeline is successfully updated, Tweetbot plays a “ping” sound but doesn’t automatically scroll to the top: instead, it places a blue bar between the last tweet you read and the newly fetched ones telling you how many new tweets you have. Swipe up, and there you have some new tweets to read – refresh again, and the previous bar goes away making room for a new one indicating new tweets. It’s a lot simpler than it sounds from a written review. Combine pull to refresh and the “new tweets” inline notification with Tweetbot’s perfect resume function and you get the idea of why I love this app so much. You know when you leave Twitter for a few hours and you come back to find hundreds of new tweets, right? To me, that usually happens in the morning when I wake up and fire up Twitter for Mac. Now, in most Twitter apps for iOS the action of loading past tweets isn’t well implemented at all: you have to manually scroll to the bottom, and keep scrolling until an API limit is reached and the app can’t get any more tweets. In Tweetbot, you get a visual “break” between recent tweets and past ones in the form of an empty dark grey bar with a + icon in the middle. When you tap on that, the app begins loading tweets, “opens” the timeline with a cool animation and puts loaded tweets in there. Your position is maintained, and the process takes seconds even on 3G. In my tests, Tweetbot has always been reliable at keeping my exact position in the timeline even after days, and it always loaded new / past tweets correctly. For work purposes, this is simply great: I don’t lose my position in the timeline, and I don’t lose tweets. It’s a win-win feature.

The best thing about Tweetbot, however, isn’t the timeline itself: it’s how you can do stuff with tweets that impressed me since the first beta I installed on my iPhone. It’s how you can perform actions on tweets easily, quickly, with just a few gestures or taps without being forced to leave the timeline at all. And when you *do need* to leave the timeline to open another view that can’t be displayed inline (for obvious reasons), Tweetbot makes sure you get there with ease. Everything in Tweetbot is intuitive. A big feature of version 1.0 is support for gestures: you can swipe right on a tweet to view a conversation, or swipe left to view “related tweets” – namely, all replies to the author. These features are useful and fun to use for three reasons: they have their own sound effects and indicators next to the main tweet; they’re fast; they’re so addictive you’ll wonder why didn’t anyone else think of them before. Ever since I started using Tweetbot, I tried to go back to other clients and I immediately missed Tweetbot’s quick way of displaying a conversation with a single swipe. This is a functionality you can’t understand from the screenshots – you have to try it and let it grow on you.

And then there’s the **action drawer**. This is hands-down my favorite feature of Tweetbot and the one that’s helping me save a lot of time when dealing with tweets related to MacStories or material I want to write about. It works like this: tap on a tweet, and the timeline collapses to reveal a drawer “beneath” a message. This action panel contains buttons to reply, retweet, mark as favorite, open the detail view for a tweet or “do stuff.” The gear button, in fact, allows you to send to a read later service, post a link to the tweet, copy an entire tweet, email it or translate it. The “copy tweet” functionality is the one that I’ve been using the most over the past months, as it enables me to copy tweets from the @macstoriesnet account and re-post them as they are. To dismiss the action drawer, tap again on the tweet. Why is Tweetbot’s action drawer any better than Twitter’s swipe-to-reveal menu? First, it doesn’t hide a tweet and it’s unobtrusive in the way it shows up on your timeline. More importantly, it contains functionalities that several clients only let you access from a “sharing” button in the tweet detail view, which in Tweetbot is entirely optional and doesn’t need to be opened. These actions can also be activated with a tap: tap & hold on a link to send to Instapaper, tweet the URL or open in Safari; tap on a link (while the action drawer is open) to view it in the built-in web view. On the other hand, if you tap & hold on a tweet you’ll get the same options from the gear button. But there’s more: tap&hold on a profile pic to check on follow status, unfollow, add to list, DM and report for spam; double tap to open a user’s profile. This view gives you all the information you need about a user: location and website (both tappable), picture, bio, followers, following count and lists. You can block users within Tweetbot, if you want. You can also view everyone’s tweets, replies, favorites and lists without leaving the app. Furthermore, the “find people” feature in the Search tab lets you find users and follow them with literally two taps. Of course, you can browse trends, interests and saved searches, too.

Last, there’s the tweet compose window. Tapbots went for a minimal approach here, with a simple design focused on letting you get a tweet out as fast as possible. However, there are many options behind the curtain: you can save and attach drafts (I love this); switch accounts with a single tap thanks to the user button at the top; you can upload photos or videos or – here comes one of the many big features of Tweetbot – remove the location the app automatically gets for you and choose coordinates or points of interests instead.

## Wrap-up
There’s a lot to do in Tweetbot, and many little design touches and interactions I haven’t mentioned. Like the way the app displays retweets, Boxcar integration, or the blue drawer that comes down from the status bar after you’ve posted a new tweet. They play an important role in the app, but they’re all part of a much sophisticated plan when you look at the big picture. Tweetbot comes from developers who decided they wanted to make the perfect Twitter client with a beautiful user interface, an amazing feature set, and an innovative approach to timelines. That’s what I call a *risk*. A challenge that’s been in development for more than a year, a huge risk considering Twitter’s intention to undervalue “regular clients” and focus on new uses for the platform.

Yet, Tapbots wanted to make a better client.

They succeeded. Tweetbot is everything I’ve ever wanted from a Twitter app: it looks great, it’s fast on WiFi and 3G, it innovates in several aspects that have been regarded as “standards” from both users and developers for too long. Could Tweetbot be any better? Maybe. The developers could work on improving the speed of animations and refresh times as much as possible, or implement support for Readability and other URL shortening services. But as far as the Twitter experience goes, Tweetbot has got everything I’m looking for.

So go download it now. [Tweetbot](http://tapbots.com/software/tweetbot/) was a risk for Tapbots, but they managed to build the best Twitter client for iPhone I’ve ever had.

# Bluetooth Keyboard Shortcuts Support on iPhone (Request)
Hello!
I just want to first apologize for the length and specificity of this request, but I’ve been putting it off for almost 10 years now, for what it’s worth haha. I am looking for something quite specific: ~formal documentation (from Apple!) of bluetooth hardware keyboard shortcuts **on iPhone** - especially within the native apps.~

It’s quite easy to find these for shortcuts supported **on iPad** (here’s an easy example: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211096.) A lot of times, the iPad shortcut guide will even specifically mention that *some* of them are also supported on iPhone, but not *all*, but *they never specify beyond that.”* I understand that extended hardware keyboard use with iPhone is a very fringe case, but - from what I know about Apple’s principles of software development/design - I am quite sure this/these list(s) specifying which keyboard shortcuts native iOS apps support on iPhone are properly documented, *somewhere*. If they aren’t, I would strongly suggest Apple take a second to do so - surely the most valuable company in history has the resources, no?

# Tweetbot 5 iOS Review | The Psalms

On Win­dows XP bal­lot day, I spent *my* beat­nik-ass time mar­veling at the (seem­ing­ly) abrupt avail­abil­i­ty of some gen­uine­ly inno­v­a­tive social apps on the Apple App Store for the first time since iOS 7(?) Of course, I am aware that rea­son­able peo­ple would regard a “sneak peek,” NDA-vio­lat­ing, per­fect­ly Adobe Pre­miered app review to be pret­ty fuck­ing lame, and I won’t dis­pute any accu­sa­tions to the tune of “just an insane white guy with a Word­Press site,” but I still believe it’s impor­tant to talk about soft­ware *espe­cial­ly* because vir­tu­al­ly every­one uses it (as opposed to qui­et­ing down just when these apps and the peo­ple who make them attain the most advan­ta­geous pos­si­ble posi­tion to fuck the whole world.)

That said, I’m going to keep this as brief and unre­vi­sion­ist as I can: Tweetbot’s [lat­est iter­a­tion](https://9to5mac.com/2018/10/18/tweetbot-true-dark-mode-gifs/) may actu­al­ly jus­ti­fy the [ded­i­cat­ed sub­red­dit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Tweetbot/) I’ve just dis­cov­ered! (Reddit’s the last place any­one wants to talk about apps, I guess.) I’ve com­plained at length about Twitter’s increas­ing­ly hos­tile (but [jus­ti­fied, sortof](https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/25/17274828/twitter-earning-q1-2018-profit-user-growth) ) treat­ment of its once [aston­ish­ing­ly diverse land­scape of third-par­ty clients and tools](https://mashable.com/2009/05/02/twitter-iphone-apps/#S_O.z..2mqqJ), yet I’d hon­est­ly grown sig­nif­i­cant­ly in accept­ing that the dynam­ic would nev­er again see the pow­er of the world’s most cash-stuffed com­pa­nies deliv­ered into the sweaty hands of small, kooky one and two-man teams, and it *nev­er* would’ve occurred to me that Tweet­bot was still around — much less get­ting ready to update its trusty old app with a release that would sud­den­ly make it clear­ly more sta­ble *and* bet­ter-look­ing than its last com­peti­tor: [the Native Fuck, itself](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/twitter/id333903271?mt=8), which has also under­gone [sig­nif­i­cant cos­met­ic surgery](https://www.searchenginejournal.com/twitter-redesigns-ios-app-for-one-handed-scrolling/276541/), recent­ly. Name­ly, they moved the *one fuck­ing but­ton* that’s giv­en the app a usabil­i­ty pre­mi­um over its mobile web-based low-rent clone.

“The com­pose but­ton has been moved to the bot­tom right-hand cor­ner and “floats” as users scroll down their time­line. That means the but­ton is always avail­able to quick­ly send a tweet when the mood strikes.”

Yeah okay, *Matt*.

> We’ve got a shiny, new com­pose but­ton to unveil on Twit­ter for iOS! Eas­i­er than ever to use, the float­ing icon is promi­nent­ly dis­played and per­fect for one-hand­ed scrolling and Tweet com­pos­ing. Pro tip: Press and hold the icon to access your drafts, pho­tos, and the GIF gallery. - [@Twit­terSup­port](https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1057726896765423616)  
Twit­ter Sup­port is no [@Cher](http://twitter.com/cher), yeah, but it seems strange that less than a thou­sand of Twitter’s [more than 300 mil­lion month­ly users](http://bilge.world/media/birdearn.pdf) would both­er to engage with the announce­ment of a sig­nif­i­cant fun­da­men­tal change to its infra­struc­ture. Imag­ine if the fed­er­al gov­ern­ment announced via White House press con­fer­ence that every stop­light in the Unit­ed States was going to have its yel­low light removed to “stream­line work­flow” with­out any fur­ther expla­na­tion, yet only 1000 *total* Amer­i­cans even both­ered to tune in to the tele­vi­sion cov­er­age across all the news net­works. It’d be strange, yeah? Well, y’all are using Twit­ter more than you’re dri­ving, I’ll bet. Next time, **get out and** [vote on my Twit­ter poll](https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/1062859883211620352) **, you fas­cist!**
In my Twit­ter glo­ry days — that is, when I used to spend the entire­ty of every one of my com­mu­ni­ty col­lege class­es Tweet­ing from my phone — there was a healthy offer­ing of third-par­ty clients on both mobile and desk­top that filled the eng­lish of the era’s soft­ware media with an absolute­ly bar­bar­ic brand-beat­en pile of lin­guis­tic Twit­trash. After Twin­kle — one of the [ear­li­est and ugli­est](https://www.macrumors.com/2008/07/17/twinkle-another-twitter-client-in-app-store/) ways to use Twit­ter ever — you’d have to choose between Twit­pic, Tweet­deck, Twit­ter­counter, Twit­ter­feed, Twhirl, Twit­turly, Twt­poll, Retweet­ist, Tweepler, Hel­lotxt, Twit­dom, Tweetscan, Tweet­burn­er, Tweet­vi­sor, Twit­ter­vi­sion, Twibs, Twistori, and Twit­bin. These are just a few I picked up from a [10-year-old](https://techcrunch.com/2009/02/19/the-top-20-twitter-applications/) [TechCrunch](https://techcrunch.com/2009/02/19/the-top-20-twitter-applications/) [report](https://techcrunch.com/2009/02/19/the-top-20-twitter-applications/) list­ing the top 21 Twit­ter appli­ca­tions by traf­fic. ***Twibs*** **.**
Now, I have to stop myself from dig­ging too deep here and attempt­ing some­thing absurd like *The His­to­ry of Twit­ter Clients*, but the fuck­ing mate­r­i­al is there! I could spend an entire after­noon going through YouTube search­es and gad­get blogs because it brings me back to that time when I lived every day assum­ing these things were going to con­tin­ue to aston­ish for my entire adult­hood. So many incred­i­ble ideas! *How­ev­er,* I’m going to save them for lat­er and focus on the cream of the crop, so to speak: **Twit­terif­ic** and **Tweet­bot**, which has been a long­time favorite of mine. As I said, it was in com­mu­ni­ty col­lege that I first ponied up mon­ey for Tweet­bot 3 on my iPhone 4S sim­ply because the hype over it among app and gad­get nerds was *so bonkers* that it man­aged to spill over into my life, despite the fact that iOS7 and I were hav­ing seri­ous issues in our mar­riage.
If you trust Mark Wat­son with your life as I do, you’d bet­ter believe that Tweet­bot has been “ [a scream­er](https://youtu.be/DE1YHcoPxMk) ” since its very begin­ning, when it pio­neered the *Pre­mi­um Poweruser* seg­ment, for which a demo­graph­ic appar­ent­ly still exists. It was *fast*, yet always notice­ably smoother than the native app, just as the newest release is today. I must point out, though, that the blog­gers and YouTu­bers who’ve insist­ed that Tweet­bot or Twit­ter­rif­ic or any oth­er pre­mi­um app could replace the native Twit­ter app entire­ly on iPhone even before they were stripped of a most live/push func­tion­al­i­ty (which I’ll come back around to in just a moment,) are undoubt­ed­ly lying to them­selves — as good as they got, they nev­er over­took Twitter’s own app in imme­di­a­cy terms, which is almost inevitably going to present fun­da­men­tal deter­rence on the part of the active Twit­ter user who intends to rid them­selves of the default pedes­tri­an avenue of admin­is­tra­tion. Tweet­bot solved a lot of things, it real­ly is *daft* when it comes to noti­fi­ca­tions. It wouldn’t be the end of the world if they came a few hun­dred sec­onds late — it’s that they’re nev­er pre­dictably or con­sis­tent­ly so, which sev­ers entire­ly the human per­cep­tion of engaged *plugged-in-ness*, if you will. It’s the same phe­nom­e­na Chuck Kloster­man explores best in the con­text of DVRing live sports to watch lat­er.
> It’s dif­fi­cult to project fic­tion­al sce­nar­ios that are more oblique and unex­pect­ed than the cra­zi­est moments from real­i­ty. We all under­stand this. And that under­stand­ing is at the core of the human attrac­tion to live­ness. We don’t crave live sport­ing events because we need imme­di­a­cy; we crave them because they rep­re­sent those (increas­ing­ly rare) cir­cum­stances in which the entire spec­trum of pos­si­bil­i­ty is in play.

Please do com­plain to Twit­ter, Inc. about the API sit­u­a­tion if you’re so inclined, but the sit­u­a­tion we’re going to find our­selves in  
> All I’m try­ing to say is, **there is no fuck­ing rea­son you’d delete the Twit­ter app** — hide it away in a fold­er and nev­er ever open it again if it dis­gusts you so, but leave its noti­fi­ca­tions set­tings on so that it can keep itself busy in there. Now *that* is a smart work­flow! In fact, it was mine! And it did work for such a long time that you’d prob­a­bly for­get about the arrange­ment in no time were there not the occa­sion­al obvi­ous dis­crep­an­cies between Tweetbot’s Mention’s tab and the native app’s instant noti­fi­ca­tions. There has nev­er been — nor will there be, I think — a client for Twit­ter that can replace *some* use of its own prop­er­ties.  
> I think Tweet­bot 3 *made* me into my own ridicu­lous equiv­a­lent of a “Poweruser.” Things are a lit­tle hazy now, but I know that I depart­ed my main Twit­ter account just before the app’s release, and I didn’t come back until 2015. I was going to school in the same old mall build­ing that housed the tool store in which I was also work­ing in full-time, which is sure­ly the only expla­na­tion for the shame­less­ness I demon­strat­ed in bring­ing a wire­less Apple Blue­tooth key­board to my class­es and plac­ing it behind the phone on what­ev­er sur­face was in front of me so that I could lean for­ward and type into iOS with my nose damned near touch­ing the screen. Strange­ly, I was not able to ver­i­fy when Blue­tooth key­board sup­port was added to iOS, but we’re going to [con­clude for the sake of con­ve­nience](https://www.reddit.com/r/iphone/comments/9y1bjd/when_was_support_for_bluetooth_keyboards/) that it was first includ­ed in the imme­di­ate pre­de­ces­sor to the iPhone 4S I was using then.  
> The cognoscen­ti have been on Twit­ter for years now. Stephen Fry, the web service’s patron saint — in Britain at least, joined in 2008. How­ev­er, it wasn’t until ear­ly 2009, xsome­where around the time that Fry tweet­ed while stuck in a lift, that the ser­vice went tru­ly main­stream. Men­tions of Twit­ter, usu­al­ly involv­ing celebri­ties, could be found in news­pa­pers and on break­fast tele­vi­sion.  
> “ [Top 10 tech­nol­o­gy high­lights of 2009](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/6817359/Top-10-technology-highlights-of-2009.html) ” | **The Telegraph**  
> If you’ve made it this far, you’ve already seen the demos and skimmed reviews at least. You should know by now whether or not Tweet­bot 5 is worth it to you in pure­ly func­tion­al terms, but I think we should all acknowl­edge that **this release of Tweet­bot is like­ly the last com­pet­i­tive third-par­ty Twit­ter app for iOS**. The mess that is Twit­ter, Inc. has [made clear this year](https://blog.twitter.com/official/en_us/topics/product/2018/investing-in-the-best-twitter-experience-for-you.html) that it intends to pri­or­i­tize its own clients over main­tain­ing the APIs nec­es­sary for oth­ers to receive push noti­fi­ca­tions. And when I say “its own,” I’m also refer­ring to our dear­est [Tweet­Deck](https://youtu.be/EHDOQVAQzec), which they in fact *absorbed*. From a busi­ness per­spec­tive, it makes sense: only “six mil­lion App Store and Google Play users installed the top five third-par­ty Twit­ter clients between Jan­u­ary 2014 and July 2018,” [accord­ing to TechCrunch](https://techcrunch.com/2018/08/17/6-million-users-had-installed-third-party-twitter-clients/). I nev­er expect­ed to see Tweet­bot on the App Store charts again, nor would I have con­sid­ered that [Echophon](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/echofon-for-twitter/id286756410?mt=8), [Tweet­Cast­er](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/tweetcaster-for-twitter/id420792544) or Twit­ter­rif­ic would have been left avail­able. They’re on the App Store, at least, and I can con­firm that they all tech­ni­cal­ly *still work*, but it’s safe to say they’re show­ing their fuck­ing age. Tweet­bot and Twit­ter­rif­ic, though, are not just satel­lite prod­ucts of the plat­form — they *[lit­er­al­ly built it](https://furbo.org/2011/03/11/twitterrific-firsts/)*. These two are the poles that have spent Twitter’s life­time thus far demon­strat­ing for the com­pa­ny and its user­base their own respec­tive inter­pre­ta­tions of a mobile social appli­ca­tion. Today, they are unit­ed — along with [Talon](http://klinkerapps.com/talon-overview/) and [Tweet­ings](https://www.tweetings.net/apps/) — in a [plea for con­tin­ued access](http://apps-of-a-feather.com/) to the plat­form they helped estab­lish on behalf of Twit­ter users and devel­op­ers around the world.  
Both Tweet­bot and Twit­ter­rif­ic are in their 5th ver­sions, and nei­ther has actu­al­ly changed much since iOS 7. (Twit­ter­rif­ic appears to still be in the same ver­sion num­ber.) Fac­ing the grow­ing walls around the ser­vice, one strug­gles to imag­ine them sur­viv­ing more than one or two iOS releas­es, but [I’ve been wrong before](https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/712292559058444288). (In fact, I dis­cov­ered yes­ter­day that Look­book is [still around some­how](https://lookbook.nu/mom).) By the time iOS 7 came around, the new native Twit­ter app still [looked fuck­ing ter­ri­ble](https://www.cultofmac.com/246067/twitter-for-ios-7-released-with-new-design-icon-on-iphone-and-ipad/). When Tap­bots [released Tweet­bot 3](https://mashable.com/2013/10/24/tweetbot-3-for-iphone-review/#SDbMxlCvFPqx), every­thing about its visu­al expe­ri­ence was beyond any­thing we’d seen on the iPhone before and its effec­tive­ness as a Twit­ter tool was imme­di­ate­ly rec­og­niz­able in con­trast with even Jack’s brand-new app and mobile web expe­ri­ence. The ani­ma­tions were taste­ful and smooth and the “pro user” label on Tapbot’s demo­graph­ic allowed them to ful­ly explore the func­tion­al­i­ty of iPhone’s ges­tures sep­a­rate any bond with the hypo­thet­i­cal­ly least-capa­ble user.

This is a dynam­ic which I am appar­ent­ly unable to avoid across just about all of my sub­jects — includ­ing [dig­i­tal media](http://extratone.com/freq) — so you may take it as gen­er­al­ly unrea­son­able or extreme, but I’m near­ly as tired of being treat­ed as an idiot *user* as I am an idiot *read­er*. *Read­abil­i­ty* is to *Usabil­i­ty*, etc. It’s espe­cial­ly aggra­vat­ing when I *could* do so much more if devel­op­ers would just assume I’m capa­ble of any knowl­edge acqui­si­tion or intel­lec­tu­al growth what­so­ev­er. Except for a few left­over key­board short­cuts, the native Twit­ter app’s only func­tion are the most obvi­ous to engage with, as per the high­est pos­si­ble stan­dards of use, which would make per­fect sense if it was paired with com­pe­tent invest­ments in *Acces­si­bil­i­ty*, but Twit­ter always appears to [detest the sub­ject](https://theoutline.com/post/2458/there-are-still-some-people-on-twitter-who-don-t-have-280-characters?amp=&zd=1&zi=zbzf6tkp), even while qui­et­ly putting in some of the work. Thanks to Mastodon’s explic­it and vis­i­ble acknowl­edge­ment of acces­si­bil­i­ty by way of just one young Ger­man man and a vol­un­teer team, we cer­tain­ly know it’s *not* because it’s an expen­sive one at all. (The “if Mastodon can do it than Twit­ter can *def­i­nite­ly* fuck­ing do it” argu­ment can be expand­ed almost with­out lim­it.)

> Some­where out there is a social media man­ag­er using a screen read­er whose pro­fes­sion­al­ism has been under­mined by the belief that the update is avail­able to every­one. We deserve equal access to the tools our peers take for grant­ed, and the secu­ri­ty to know that we will be able to do our jobs tomor­row regard­less of updates. -Kit Englard for [The Out­line](https://theoutline.com/post/2458/there-are-still-some-people-on-twitter-who-don-t-have-280-characters)  
I would like to com­mend myself now for mak­ing it this far with­out men­tion­ing **Lists** — a sub­ject which I’ve already [Tweet­ed](https://twitter.com/i/moments/996616971880882176) and [writ­ten](http://www.extratone.com/tech/lists/) about exten­sive­ly — but this time, I have the won­drous bless­ing of two pre­miere mobile soft­ware com­pa­nies who rec­og­nized the poten­tial pow­er in list func­tion­al­i­ty to dis­pel or avoid most of the inher­ent risks assigned to the usage of a social net­work like Twit­ter and bet heav­i­ly on it. Nei­ther can be uti­lized to the fullest with­out lists and *wouldn’t it be such a shame* to not get your money’s worth? Tap­bots expand­ed their cura­tive abil­i­ty tremen­dous­ly by adding cus­tomiz­able fil­ters to any time­line in Tweet­bot, allow­ing the user to infi­nite­ly manip­u­late incom­ing posts with any com­bi­na­tion of every vari­able sup­port­ed by the core Twit­ter code itself. With­in a mat­ter of sec­onds, you could cre­ate a fil­ter that will exclude all Tweets except for those from unver­i­fied accounts that men­tion “blimps” and include a media attach­ment and apply this fil­ter to any of the app’s time­line views — includ­ing Home, Men­tions, Pro­file (your own Tweets,) your Favorites, and your Search­es — every­thing but your Direct Mes­sages can be sort­ed this way.

“ [Tweet­bot for iOS Tips](https://tapbots.com/tweetbot/tips/),” Tap­bots Tweet­Bot and I accom­plished a lot of sort­ing togeth­er, and it wouldn’t have occurred to me had it not crept to #1 Paid Social App again a few weeks ago that per­haps [my bias towards Twit­ter lists](http://www.extratone.com/tech/lists/) could be entire­ly attrib­uted to my ear­ly use of Tweet­Bot and Twit­ter­rif­ic, which allowed me to amass a [Fol­low­ing count](https://twitter.com/neoyokel/following) of over 5000 with­out phys­i­cal­ly per­ish­ing or men­tal­ly dis­in­te­grat­ing to the point of unde­ni­able insan­i­ty. How­ev­er, by the time [Tweet­Bot 4 was released](https://www.theverge.com/2015/10/1/9432291/tweetbot-4-ipad-iphone-available) in 2015, it had long since swapped places with the native app with­in my iPhone’s home­screens and was only used when I felt par­tic­u­lar­ly like Tweet­storm­ing from a sta­tion­ary sit­u­a­tion. From my wire­less Apple Key­board, this meant Cmd (⌘)-N to com­pose a Tweet and ⌘-Enter to send it.
Today — [in Tweet­bot 5](https://www.macstories.net/reviews/tweetbot-5-for-ios-brings-a-redesign-dedicated-giphy-support-and-a-new-dark-mode/) — this con­tin­ues to be a tried-and-true method of Tweet­ing Tweets on Twit­ter, smooth­ly and effi­cient­ly, as always. Return­ing to Ye Olde Alter­na­tive in 2018 yields both famil­iar *and* new­ly-imple­ment­ed goods: ani­ma­tion and audio noti­fi­ca­tions are car­ried over and/or updat­ed as need­ed to main­tain a flu­id and fresh expe­ri­ence. The abil­i­ty to switch between its intel­li­gent­ly-cho­sen col­or themes with a two-fin­gered ver­ti­cal swipe, alone will be jus­ti­fi­ca­tion enough for many users like myself to hand over anoth­er $4.99 to the Tap­bots devel­op­ers who’ve man­aged against all odds to one-up Twitter’s own mobile app devel­op­ment one last time. Over any oth­er alter­na­tive app, Tweet­bot 5 retains the robust qual­i­ties nec­es­sary to achieve #1 Paid Social App sta­tus on the App Store despite its new API shack­les.

# An exhaustive list of Keyboard Shortcuts for iPad and iPhone

[Yesterday we told you about new keyboard shortcuts added in iOS 7](https://www.iphonehacks.com/2013/11/ios-7-keyboard-shortcuts.html), but iOS already supported a bunch of keyboard shortcuts that many people might not be aware of. So here’s an exhaustive list of keyboard shortcuts for iPhone and iPad that can be used with a Bluetooth wireless keyboard.

While keyboard shortcuts are hard to remember, they’re a great productivity boost once you get over the learning curve. So if you’re in a text editing application, you won’t have to take your hands off the keyboard each time you want to select text to copy and paste.

Since most of these shortcuts are largely undocumented, you can refer to this list to get started:

**System Shortcuts**

* **F1** Dim screen
* **F2** Brighten screen
* **F7** Back one song
* **F8** Play/pause
* **F9** Skip song
* **F10** Mute
* **F11** Decrease volume
* **F12** Increase volume
* **⌘ Space** Display a list of available languages; to choose one, tap the space bar again.

**Text Selection and navigation**

These shortcuts are the same as on any Mac, so you shouldn’t have any problem picking them up quickly on the iPad.

* **⌘C**  Copy
* **⌘X** Cut
* **⌘V** Paste
* **⌘Z** Undo
* **⌘⇧Z**  Redo
* **⌘Delete** to Delete the text to the beginning of the line
* **Control K** to Delete the text to the end of the line
* **Alt (Option) Delete** to Delete the word before the cursor
* **⌘↑**  Jump to top of document
* **⌘↓**  Jump to bottom of document
* **⌘←**  Jump to beginning of line
* **⌘→**  Jump to end of line
* **Alt↑** Jump to previous start of line
* **Alt  ↓** Jump to next end of line
* **Alt  ←** Jump to previous word
* **Alt  →** Jump to next word
* **⇧** ↑ Select the text above
* **⇧** ↓ Select the text below
* **⇧** ← Select the text on the left
* **⇧** → Select the text on the right
* **⇧⌘↑**  Select all the text to the beginning of the document
* **⇧⌘↓** Select all the text to the end of the document
* **⇧⌘←** Select the text to the beginning of the line
* **⇧⌘→** Select the text to the end of the line
* **⇧Alt↑** Select the text above, line by line
* **⇧Alt↓** Select the text below, line by line
* **⇧Alt←**  Select the text on the left, word by word
* **⇧Alt→**  Select the text on the right, word by word

**iPad Navigation**

While not normally enabled, iOS will also let you switch between apps and do a lot more if you enable VoiceOver. To switch it on, go to Settings > General > Accessibility > and turn on VoiceOver. Along with the shortcuts, this will also enable the actual voice over, but you can turn that off by pressing Control + Option + S.

* **Control Option H**   Home button
* **Control Option H H**   Show multitask bar
* **Control Option i**   Item chooser
* **Escape**   Back button
* **→**   next item
* **←**   previous item
* **↑↓ simultaneously** tap selected item
* **Option↓**  scroll down
* **Option↑**  scroll up
* **Option← or →**  scroll left or right
* **Control Option S**  turn VoiceOver speech on or off
* **Command Shift Tab**  switch to the previous app
* **Command Tab**  switch back to the original app
* **←+→, then Option + ← or Option+→**  navigate through Dock

**Safari**

* **⌘L** Open Location
* **⌘T** open a new tab
* **⌘W** close the current tab
* **⌘R** refresh the current tab
* **⌘.** stop loading the current tab

**Mail**

* **⌘N** create a new message
* **⌘⇧D** send a message
* **Backspace key** to delete the currently selected message
* **↑ or ↓**  select suggested email address in To/CC/BCC popover fields

**Pages**

* **⌘⇧K** comment
* **⌘⌥K** show next comment
* **⌘⌥⇧K** show previous comment

The iOS 7 SDK lets developers add custom keyboard shortcuts in their apps for external Bluetooth keyboards. So expect your favorite iOS text editor to add support for this very soon.

Have we missed any other keyboard shortcuts for the iPhone or iPad in the list? Let us know in the comments below.

# Developer Display Requirements | Twitter Terms of Service
The power of Twitter is in the network of people using it, and its ability to bring users closer to what’s most meaningful to them. When we first launched, Tweets were a simple 140 character update. However, as Twitter evolved, so too has the way that users view and interact with Tweets. Today’s Tweets are rich living conversations: a user can give feedback to the author, participate in the conversation, and spread the word. For that to happen, Tweets must be shown in a way that meets the user’s expectation - whether on a mobile phone, on a web site, in a desktop application, or anywhere else. Developing the following set of Display Requirements allows Tweets to remain connected to every user on Twitter. For example, if Tweet actions aren’t enabled, a Tweet can’t be replied to or reach more users with Retweets. If @usernames and avatars aren’t linked to profiles, users can’t learn more about or easily follow that interesting Twitter account. It’s also worth noting that we have embeddable Tweets and embeddable timelines available, which will take care of these Display Requirements for you. Lastly, we’re committed to bringing the power and interactivity of the Twitter network to all platforms, and we will continue to evolve the user experience within Tweets and timelines. This is a living document, so please check back from time to time for updates. Last update date: November 20th, 2012





Above: Examples for rendering details of Individual Tweets on websites and mobile apps.

1. **Tweet Author**

```
1. The Tweet author’s avatar must always be displayed, unless your application is displaying Tweets on a mobile platform that has clear physical or technical limitations (e.g., low-end feature phones).
2. The @username must always be displayed with the “@” symbol.
3. The author’s name and @username must be displayed to the right of the avatar either on one line horizontally or stacked one above the other vertically, with the name first.
4. The avatar, name, and @username must all link to the user’s Twitter profile.
```

2. **Tweet Text**

```
1. Tweet text must be displayed on a line below the author’s name and @username, and may not be altered or modified in any way except as outlined in these requirements.
2. [Tweet Entities](https://web.archive.org/web/20130116074649/https://dev.twitter.com/docs/tweet-entities) within the Tweet text must be properly linked to their appropriate home on Twitter. For example:
```

```
	1. User_mentions must link to the mentioned user’s profile.
	2. Hashtags must link to a twitter.com search with the hashtag as the query.
	3. Links in Tweet text must be displayed using the display_url field in the URL entities API response, and link to the original t.co url field.
```

3. **Tweet Actions**

```
1. Reply, Retweet, and Favorite action icons must always be visible for the user to interact with the Tweet. These actions must be implemented using [Web Intents](https://web.archive.org/web/20130116074649/https://dev.twitter.com/docs/intents) or with the authenticated Twitter API.
2. No other social or 3rd party actions similar to Follow, Reply, Retweet and Favorite may be attached to a Tweet.
```

4. **Tweet Timestamp**

```
1. The Tweet timestamp must always be visible and include the time and date. e.g., “3:00 PM - 31 May 12”.
```

5. **Tweet Permalink**

```
1. The Tweet timestamp must always be linked to the Tweet permalink.
```

6. **Branding**

```
1. It must always be clear to the viewing user that they are looking at a Tweet, and that the content is from Twitter.
2. [The Twitter logo](https://web.archive.org/web/20130116074649/https://twitter.com/about/logos) or [Follow button](https://web.archive.org/web/20130116074649/https://dev.twitter.com/docs/follow-button) for the Tweet author must always be displayed.
3. The Twitter logo must link to Twitter.
```

In addition to the above Individual Tweet Display Requirements, a few modifications to the Tweet anatomy are required when displaying as part of a timeline:




Above: Examples for rendering a timeline of Individual Tweets on websites and mobile apps.

1. **Tweet Author**

```
1. The author’s name and @username should be displayed on one line horizontally or stacked one above the other vertically, with the name first.
2. The @username must always be displayed with the “@” symbol.
3. The avatar must be positioned to the left of the name, @username, and Tweet text.
```

2. **Tweet Actions**

```
1. Reply, Retweet and Favorite Tweet actions must always be available to the user when interacting with the Tweet on the timeline. e.g., select, hover, touch, swipe.
2. For applications on mobile platforms, you may choose to link the entire Tweet area to the Individual Tweet within your app or on Twitter to provide users access to Tweet actions.
```

3. **Tweet Timestamps**

```
1. Tweet timestamp should be displayed in the top right corner.
2. For Tweets that have been sent in the last 24 hours, use the short form timestamp relative to the current time, for example “20s” for a Tweet sent 20 seconds ago, “3m” for 3 minutes ago, “5h” for 5 hours ago.
3. Tweets older than 24 hours should show a short form date including the day and month, e.g., “6 Jun”.
```

4. **Tweet Permalink**

```
1. The Tweet timestamp must always be linked to the Tweet permalink.
2. For applications on mobile platforms, you may choose to link the entire Tweet area to the Tweet permalink.
```

5. **Retweet Indicator**

```
1. If the Tweet being displayed is a Retweet, the name of the user who Retweeted it and the Retweet icon must be displayed above or under the Tweet text. e.g., “Retweeted by Josh Brewer”. The name should link to the the Retweeting user’s profile, unless your application is displaying Tweets on a mobile platform that has clear physical or technical limitations.
```

6. **Timeline Integrity**

```
1. Tweets that are grouped together into a timeline must not be rendered with non-Twitter content. e.g., comments, updates from other networks.
```

7. **Branding**

```
1. It must always be clear to the viewing user that they are looking at a Twitter timeline, and that the content is from Twitter.
2. [The Twitter logo](https://web.archive.org/web/20130116074649/https://twitter.com/about/logos) must always be displayed directly adjacent to the timeline (e.g., top of the timeline).
```

All timelines must allow users to view details of an Individual Tweet with the requirements above.

> Twitter is a vaguely terrible way to spend your time these days, but if you (like me) can’t tear yourself away from the social media service / entryway into hell, you’ll want Tweetbot, which actually makes using Twitter far less painful. Tweetbot shows you the tweets of the people you follow, in the order that they tweeted them. There are no ads or promoted tweets, powerful mute filters to block out unwanted noise, and (thanks to Twitter’s unfriendly API changes) no notifications to constantly ping you to come back to the app.

# Minolta Weathermatic-A
## THE RUGGED SON
Discovering a forgotten need.

For the past few months, [Hawthorn](https://twitter.com/hawthorn_jr) has been unironically and unconceitedly introducing me into the World of Film photography. I’ve taken a lot of photos in my lifetime, but almost exclusively in digital save for some pre-adolescent [experimenting](http://bit.ly/dbstylus) with a 35mm Olympus point-and-shoot, so let me disclaim this *review* as perhaps not the most useful to old time film nerds. For them, other resources like [*Forgotten Charm*](http://www.forgottencharm.com/minolta-weathermatic-a-110-pocket-camera/) or [Michael Butkus](http://www.butkus.org/chinon/minolta/minolta_weathermatic/minolta_weathematic-splash.htm) would better inform a buying decision.

Kodak’s 110 Instamatic film format led to a surprisingly diverse variety of “pocket cameras,” and a great many of them are exceptionally beautiful examples of design. Despite its original, limited intended function, the industry pushed 110’s limits in the 1970s and 80s, from keychain [microcameras](https://www.lomography.com/magazine/90713-micro-110-key-chain-camera) – little more than an aperture mounted on the cartridges themselves – to [SLRs](https://blog.jimgrey.net/2012/10/05/minolta-110-zoom-slr/) with adjustable focus, exposure, and interchangeable lenses.

The second great explosion of American Buddhism occurred in the nineteen-fifties. Spurred, in large part, by the writings of the émigré Japanese scholar D. T. Suzuki, it was, in the first instance, aesthetic: Suzuki’s work, though rich in tea ceremonies and haiku, makes no mention of Zazen, the hyper-disciplined, often painful, meditation practice that is at the heart of Zen practice.

The Buddhist spirit, or the easier American variant of it, blossomed in Beat literature, producing some fine coinages (Kerouac’s “Dharma Bums”). Zen, though apparently an atypically severe sect within Buddhism, came to be the standard-bearer, so much so that “Zen” became an all-purpose modifier in American letters meaning “challengingly counterintuitive”—as in “Zen and the Art of Archery” or the masterly “Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance,” where you learn how not to aim your arrow or how to find a spiritual practice in a Harley.

It was this second movement that blossomed into a serious practice of sitting lessons and a set of institutions, the most prominent, perhaps, being the San Francisco Zen Center.

Though separated by generations, the deeper grammar of the two Buddhist awakenings was essentially the same. Buddhism in America is simultaneously exotic and familiar—it has lots of Eastern trappings and ceremonies that set it off from the materialism of American life, but it also speaks to an especially American longing for a publicly productive spiritual practice. American Buddhism spins off museum collections and Noh-play translations and vegetarian restaurants and philosophical books and, in the hands of the occasional Buddhist Phil Jackson, the triangle offense in basketball.

Introducing a new and improved Twitter API.webarchive

*We planned to launch the new Twitter API on July 16, 2020. But given the [security incident](https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1283518038445223936?s=20)we discovered on July 15, 2020, the timing of our launch no longer made sense or felt right.*

*We updated this post on August 12, 2020 to include additional details below to support the official launch of the new Twitter API.*

Today, we’re introducing the new Twitter API. Rebuilt from the ground up to deliver new features faster, today’s release includes the first set of new endpoints and features we’re launching so developers can help the world connect to the public conversation happening on Twitter.
If you can’t wait to check it out, [visit the new developer portal](https://developer.twitter.com/en/portal/opt-in). If you can, then read on for more about what we’re building, what’s new about the Twitter API v2, what’s launching first, and what’s coming next.

Your feedback has been essential in helping us define our vision and roadmap for the new Twitter API. From Tweets to focus groups, you have shared a ton of feedback with us over the past few years about what you need out of the Twitter API and what we can do better. We also [learned a lot](https://blog.twitter.com/developer/en_us/topics/tools/2020/a-year-with-twitter-developer-labs.html) through [Twitter Developer Labs](https://blog.twitter.com/developer/en_us/topics/tools/2019/building-the-next-generation-of-the-twitter-api.html) where you’ve been sharing real-time feedback on the new API features we’ve tested in the open.

We’ve always known that our developer ecosystem is diverse, but our API has long taken a one-size-fits-all approach. Your feedback helped us see the importance of making the new Twitter API more flexible and scalable to fit your needs. With the new API, we are building new elevated access options and new product tracks, so more developers can find options to meet their needs. More on that below.
We also know it’s important to be able to plan ahead, and we want to do a better job of sharing our plans with you in advance. Going forward, we’ll share more of what’s coming next on our [public roadmap](https://trello.com/b/myf7rKwV/twitter-api-platform-roadmap)  (updates coming soon). We're also sharing a [Guide to the future of the Twitter API](http://developer.twitter.com/en/products/twitter-api/early-access/guide)  for more about what to expect as we roll out the new API. We have a lot planned, and it will evolve and improve as we continue to hear from you.

**A new foundation** - The new API is built on a completely new foundation —  [rebuilt for the first time since 2012](https://blog.twitter.com/engineering/en_us/topics/infrastructure/2020/rebuild_twitter_public_api_2020.html) — and includes new features so you can get more out of the public conversation. That new foundation allows us to add new functionality faster and better than we’ve done in the past, so expect more new features from Twitter to show up in the API.

With this new foundation, developers can expect to see:

* A cleaner API that's easier to use, with new developer features like the ability to specify which fields get returned, or retrieve more Tweets from a conversation within the same response
* Some of the most requested features that were missing from the API, including conversation threading, poll results in Tweets, pinned Tweets on profiles, spam filtering, and a more powerful stream filtering and search query language

**New access levels** - With the new Twitter API, we’re building multiple [access levels](https://developer.twitter.com/en/products/twitter-api/early-access/guide#newways) to make it easier for developers to get started and to grow what they build. In the past, the Twitter API was separated into three different platforms and experiences: standard (free), premium (self-serve paid), and enterprise (custom paid). As a developer's needs expanded, it required tedious migration to each API. In the future, all developers — from academic researchers to makers to businesses — will have options to get elevated access and grow on the same API.

This Tweet is unavailable



**New product tracks** - We love the incredible diversity of developers who use our API. Our plan is to introduce new, distinct [product tracks](https://developer.twitter.com/en/products/twitter-api/early-access/guide#newways) to better serve different groups of developers and provide them with the right experience and support for their needs, along with a range of relevant access levels, and appropriate pricing (where applicable). To start, these product tracks will include:

* **Standard**: Available first, this will be the default product track for most developers, including those just getting started, building something for fun, for a good cause, and to learn or teach. We plan to add Elevated access to this track in the future.
* **Academic** **Research**: [Academic researchers](https://developer.twitter.com/en/use-cases/academic-researchers) use the Twitter API to understand what’s happening in the public conversation. In the future, qualified academic researchers will have a way to get Elevated or Custom access to relevant endpoints. We’re also providing [tools and guides](https://developer.twitter.com/en/use-cases/academic-researchers/helpful-tools) to make it easier to conduct academic research with the Twitter API.
* **Business**: Developers build businesses on the Twitter API, including our [Twitter Official Partners](https://partners.twitter.com/en) and [enterprise data customers](https://data.twitter.com/en/customers/enterprise-data). We love that their products help other people and businesses better understand and engage with the conversation on Twitter. In the future, this track will include Elevated or Custom access to relevant endpoints.

**A new developer portal** - To help you get the most out of the new API, we’ve also designed and built a new developer portal. This is where you can get started with our new onboarding wizard, manage Apps, understand your API usage and limits, access our new support center, find documentation, and more to come in the future.

### With the new Twitter API, we hope to enable more:

* Academic research that helps the world better understand our shared perspectives on important topics such as: people’s attitudes about [COVID-19](https://developer.twitter.com/en/case-studies/penn), the social impact of [floods and climate change](https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/10/21128744/twitter-data-floods-noaa-climate-change), or the prevalence of [hateful speech](https://hatelab.net/projects/) and how to address it.
* Tools that help make Twitter better for the people who use it, like: [BlockParty](https://www.blockpartyapp.com/), [TweetDelete](https://tweetdelete.net/), and [Tokimeki Unfollow](https://tokimeki-unfollow.glitch.me/).
* Bots that share information and make conversations more fun like the: [HAM: Drawings bot](https://twitter.com/ham_drawing), [House of Lords Hansard bot](https://twitter.com/HansardLord), and [Emoji Mashup bot](https://twitter.com/EmojiMashupBot).
* Businesses like [Black Swan](https://www.blackswan.com/), [Spiketrap](https://www.spiketrap.io/), and [Social Market Analytics](https://www.socialmarketanalytics.com) who serve innovative use cases such as social prediction of future product trends, AI-powered consumer insights and FinTech market intelligence.
* Twitter Official Partners such as [Brandwatch](https://partners.twitter.com/en/partners/brandwatch), [Sprinklr](https://partners.twitter.com/en/partners/sprinklr) and [Sprout Social](https://partners.twitter.com/en/partners/sprout-social) who help brands better understand and engage with their industry and customers.
* And much more, including new things we haven't thought of yet, but that we know you will...

One of the most common reasons developers use the Twitter API is to listen to and analyze the conversation happening on Twitter. So, soon we’ll release Early Access to an [initial set of new endpoints](https://twittercommunity.com/t/announcing-early-access-to-the-next-generation-of-the-twitter-api/139612) for developers to:

All API features we’re releasing first will be available in our new – always free – Basic access level. For most developers, Basic access will provide everything you need to get started and build something awesome.

Eventually, the new API will fully replace the v1.1 standard, premium, and enterprise APIs. Before that can happen though, we have more to build, which is why we are referring to this phase as [Early Access](https://developer.twitter.com/en/products/twitter-api/early-access/guide#rollingout). It's a chance to get started now and get ahead.

Unlike Twitter Developer Labs which hosts our experiments, everything in the first release will be fully supported and ready for you to use in production. To see the full list of API functionality and endpoints that are included in today’s release, check out our [developer forum post](https://twittercommunity.com/t/announcing-early-access-to-the-next-generation-of-the-twitter-api/139612).

You can get started on the new API by creating a new Project and App today in the new developer portal. You can also connect your new Project to existing Apps, if you would like.

To get started with Early Access to the new Twitter API, [visit the new developer portal](https://developer.twitter.com/en/portal/opt-in). If you don’t yet have a developer account, [apply](https://developer.twitter.com/en/apply-for-access) to get started.

This is just the beginning. We’re [sharing our public roadmap](https://trello.com/b/myf7rKwV/twitter-api-platform-roadmap) to keep you updated on our vision for the API, along with options to share feedback so that we can continue to learn from you along the way and so you can plan for what’s to come. On deck: full support to hide (and unhide) replies, and free Elevated access for academic researchers.

Developers like you push us and inspire us every day. Your creativity and work with our API make Twitter better for people & businesses, and make the world a better place. Thanks for your partnership on the journey ahead.

# Native Software (iOS 14)
[[iOS 14 Review Notes]]
## Siri, Discreet Idiot
Siri Shortcuts are essentially associated with Apple’s personal assistent only in name, but she does still have a particular value you may or may not have considered: if you’re the sort to worry about your “privacy” in 2021, Siri is [the most discreet voice assistent available](https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/29/20837077/apple-siri-privacy-opt-out-voice-human-grading-review), by far. Of course, this also makes her the definitive *worst* in functional terms, yet she remains the only one which has added (albeit diminutive) value to my own life. The “disable all alarms” command - while it should probably exist on its own in the native Clocks app - is a particularly useful function.

- [ ] I actually witnessed a 20-year-old, well-adjusted young woman in the wild use Hey Siri to make a call, yesterday.

[[Mastodon Poll](https://mastodon.social/@DavidBlue/105669638356618385)]
In my iPhone 8 Plus review, I noted:
> ...frankly, I can’t imagine looking at the  [gluttonous](http://www.extratone.com/audio/futureland/toomanymessengers/)  palate of available mobile, cross-platform messaging services (Telegram,  [now Telegram X](https://telegram.org/blog/telegram-x) , WhatsApp, Signal, Snapchat, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Discord, Slack, Tinder?, Google Hangouts, Google Allo, Google Chat, Viber, Skype, Line, Wire, etc.) and thinking… well, none of this will do!

- [ ] As with many iOS feature additions, these days, **Widgets** seem in large part to address a problem which Apple made for themselves by removing some other, much-less-complex function from the operating system. I’ve no idea why they would choose to remove the percentage readout from the top of the iPhone’s screen on newer models, but at least one can reclaim them, sort of, by placing a quarter-sized battery widget on their homescreen.
- [ ] It’s bizarre that Microsoft’s Outlook has unequivocally surpassed iOS’ native Mail app in the ratings. This... I could literally *never* have predicted.

> So on face ID specifically hi I'm looking at my iPhone A+ review right now 2 1/2 years ago I am and I guess you know what I guess this review really I said actually just ring something that I can't sit down and read my own shit anymore I am I was really better about the iPhone ex I just didn't like it I am very I was resistant to change I've been using the same shape of iPhone since 2007 since I was that we young man in the picture with the holding it on with KFC picture of him he only does require as a Nilay Patel noted one might regard the eight is the last compromise of basically four years of the same side since launch it's unsurprisingly stayed away that too far behind on the spreadsheets for most android type folks not that I've ever believed and truly in capable of comprehending what it means to package of product given where the greasy start up salt it up And then parentheses you cannot doubt me I want to be your long sabbatical from Iowa is for the Sony is free to play arm and my authority is absolutely the rest are trying to decide whether not to pay $200 more for "the phone at the future which knows when you're watching it and is only good for playing half an hour of stupid video games before it needs a charge yeah I am OK so face and he specifically I've only had this phone for a few days Jesus him to three days oh my God I get it oh my God for things like my password manager am in comparison to using a thumb holy hell yeah I guess I've been OK I've only use it in good light but then again when am I ever I mean your screen is bright yeah I can't I entire fleetly get it to and yeah I know that annotation which may or may not show up because apparently hypothesis but has been breaking my posts and I might turn it off but since being like the annotation thing that pops up I am on bills the world but a arm what I say go back oh it's pouring out that like yes I'm at I said I'd rather have experienced it in a big boy top line flag ship handset after 2 1/2 years of refinement I assume I assume their face ID is better now than it was then everything I said about face ID this review sound stupid entirely unnecessary at best I am yeah it's I can see it in this phone at least I'm in a in a very very a constrain conditions which I have used it being in my house lamps on screens I am god it's so much easier than using my thumb so much easier and you know him well while I'm on that topic I guess maybe I should put the clip---  
The mask thing is a problem... I’ve had the immense privilege of *not* having to wear a mask for an entire workday (honestly not sure how I would manage it considering that my glasses immediately fog up completely when I have worn a mask,) but I played around with setting up Face ID’s “alternate appearance” option, which seems like it would do the trick. It would be nice if one could set up multiple alternate appearances - I needed to use my single slot for my appearance when wearing my Bose Soundlink headphones. I’m genuinely curious if you’ve found success with it.

# The Psalms' 2020
The Psalms 2020 WordCloud

## Screens and software subjects big & small discussed within my most moderate 35,000 words ever.
Believe it or not, the cyclical cold season has once again come to pass! Oh, the [W̘͖̯E̟̹À̫T̯̫͓̪̮͓̼H̝E̪͇̰̘̖͍ͅŔ͍̖̱̟̪](https://youtu.be/qg0ZPmSux_4)!! If the past two days on Twitter were any indication, it is indeed time for a year's-end retrospective on what has been published on this Web Site. Given the extent of the attention I've devoted to bilge.world this past year - both technically and editorially - I thought it would be nice to chuck in a bit more in the pursuit of whacking myself on the back. I understand that 2020 has been one helluva catastrophic marker of linear time for just about everyone on Earth - as I write this on its last day, the [inexplicable news of MF Doom's death](https://www.complex.com/music/2020/12/mf-doom-dead-49) has just surfaced and has already hit my adjacent communities remarkably hard.

## Spring
The earliest archive.org capture of this particular Writeas blog dates back only to [May 1st of this year](https://web.archive.org/web/20200501203946/https://bilge.world/), but its stylistic contrast with the site's current version is immense. I believe I was using [Max Henderson's Anxiety theme](https://write.as/themes/anxiety) virtually stock, albeit with some color rearrangements. By the [29th](http://web.archive.org/web/20200529000327/https://bilge.world/), I had already arrived upon the colors you see today. "[You Know I'm Blogging](https://bilge.world/you-know-im-blogging)" was just a meta update to say *howdy* after such a long drought, but "[Dirty Dave's Poweruser Tips](https://bilge.world/poweruser-tips-software-shortcuts)" actually proved popular (for me) among my newly-connected Fedi crowd, especially, thanks to [an annotated share by Writeas on Twitter](https://twitter.com/writeas__/status/1252704432497836034). Honestly, it was entirely worth it just for the accomplishment of [exposing my platform peer Dino Bansigan to **Alt+D**](https://journal.dinobansigan.com/dirty-daves-poweruser-tips-david-blue). Writeas Community Manager CJ Eller and I began corresponding, which led to [an interview](https://write.as/community/chat-with-david-blue) regarding writing tools, managing fiddly compulsions, and the wonder of Markdown.

> I think I'm just now coming around to understanding personal blogging and the freedom that entails. It's been a long while since I've had the urge to write about things on which I don't consider myself at least somewhat of an authority. I think – like many people – I originally just used my personal blog as a guinea pig for messing around with themes, and I'm just now actually catching up on some of the lesser items on my “to-write” list.  
> I dug deep in my long-overdue todo list for "[Z̴͏a͞l͟g͝o͏ ̕G͟͝e͞n͞҉è̛ŗ͡a͝͞t̴o҉r͞ for iOS](https://bilge.world/zalgo-generator-ios-app-review)," which - along with [my 2018 review of Unichar](https://bilge.world/unichar-for-ios-app-review) - I felt was a necessary celebration of digital text as a weapon, which is very dear to me. "[Preferred Writing Instruments](https://bilge.world/preferred-writing-instruments)" was probably the singular analog departure *The Psalms* will ever see and my condensed commentary on [*Star Trek: Picard*](https://bilge.world/star-trek-picard-review), [*Star Trek: Discovery*](https://bilge.world/star-trek-discovery-review), and [the current state of *Star Trek: Online*](https://bilge.world/star-trek-online) should fulfill all need mention of science fiction, here, for a very long time. Given [yesterday's news regarding Slack's acquisition](https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/1/21719666/salesforce-slack-acquisition-purchase-announced), perhaps I should feel revalidated in my insistence that "[Discord is Better Than Slack](https://bilge.world/discord-slack-comparison)," but a developer friend of mine actually addressed my curiosity regarding why startups never mention Discord as a workplace option, despite its identical functionality: it's all about fuckin' *enterprise security*.  
I had wanted to write about [*The Langoliers*](https://letterboxd.com/film/the-langoliers/) - Stephen King's flop of a made-for-TV movie/extended *Twilight Zone* episode - for a long while. It was probably the first program I watched as a child that genuinely disturbed me and always returns to my thoughts by barren-ish experiences. I had planned to watch the whole three hours all the way through and write whatever came to mind, but I only made it halfway or so in "[Craig Toomey's Coronavirus](https://bilge.world/the-langoliers-stephen-king)" before I ran completely out of steam. I dropped what I had without revision, to this day. Perhaps one day I shall return...

> In the right hour, the woodland springtime metamorphic processes of the neighboring Lake Geneva suburb’s in-betweens were in a paused state – the toads again hushed; the crickets tired, and the human populace, too. In the right hour, the fickle wind and the social owls were the only sound, and nothing moved but the sparse, light-footed doe in careful segments with her fawn.  
> These two sentences begin the sixth chapter of my indefinitely-postponed novel, [*Blimp's Burden*](https://github.com/extratone/pith), and are almost certainly my best writing, ever. My vanity simply wouldn't allow them to go forgotten, so I [published the chapter as an excerpt on *The Psalms*](https://bilge.world/blimps-burden-chapter-6). It may seem an intimidating wall of text, but give it your attention and you'll be amused, I think.  
The Psalms Stats by Post - 2020

## Summer
The general, distinctly 21st-century wisdom regarding one's content popularity seems to be something like *you never know what's going to blow up*. I experienced this phenomena quite severely for the first time in my writing life after posting "[Google Is Not God of The Web](https://bilge.world/google-page-experience)" on [HackerNews](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23383548) right before going out-of-touch for some 13 straight hours amidst a local BLM protest. I did not intend to write a baity title, nor did I expect anything to come of sharing it, there - I only did so simply because the thought crossed my mind. Honestly, it is probably the least-considered content I'd ever published on *The Psalms* - I only put it up when I did because I knew *all* of my energy was about to be absorbed for an entire weekend or more. I only started the thing because I felt it important to raise a small voice in reminder that tech media had started using language when discussing code/online development which had begun to assume the existence of a single, objective standard of measure for *good web design*. (Fuck your bootstrap baloney, [*The Drywall Website*](https://iowa.neocities.org/test) was a *real* *paradigm shit*.)

And yet... That single goddamned post would end up accruing more pageviews than all of my writing on the web, combined (I suspect.) Tens of thousands of words were written in hundreds of comments, which I did my best to parse in [a *for the hell of it* substack email](https://davidblue.substack.com/p/witness-google-god-and-local-history):

> Out of everything I’ve shared on *Bilge* recently, it’s hilarious that this particular post - on which I spent a cumulative total of perhaps 25 minutes writing and made less effort than ever to edit - became probably my most widely-shared work of all time.  
> Once again, I *am* thankful for the readership and correspondence, I just *really fucking wish* it had been on literally *anything* else I've written about technology.  
In retrospect, it really is bonkers that I was excited about yet another vague promise to *re-imagine email* in the days surrounding [the launch of Basecamp's HEY](https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/15/21286466/hey-email-basecamp-price-availability-platforms-launch), but I feel it's important to nurture what paltry genuine enthusiasm remains about technology and the future, so I decided to respond to the service's homepage prompt, asking interested visitors to write in with their own thoughts on email. I spent a morning clacking out "[Email and I: An Abridged History](https://bilge.world/hey-email-history)," which I hope will one day serve as a part-foundation for a thorough, composed extension to my [*Why I Write About Technology*](https://gist.github.com/extratone/91ebe16b0c620f309e70b40f5d4dcd9e) series. This would be *The Psalms* last relevant work for a few months, while I played around with [an experimental WordPress website](https://www.davidblue.wtf/wordpress-experimentation/) and dove into [*fuckin' school*](https://www.davidblue.wtf/college-return/) for the first time in seven years.

WTF

## Fall
I returned in late September with a partial recount of what I'd discovered: "[Indulging Once More in Digital Excess](https://bilge.world/digital-excess)." After exploring the concept of [*Digital Gardens*](https://tomcritchlow.com/blogchains/digital-gardens/), buying [my first pro-ready desktop PC](https://www.davidblue.wtf/hp-envy-desktop/) in 10 years, playing with Big Boy Adobe software for the first time, and reading [a delightful book](https://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674417076) documenting the history of word processing, I arrived upon the term *Software Historian* with which to partially describe myself. It doesn't mean all that much at the moment, but will no doubt be explored imminently on this Web Site.

Addressing "[The Social Dilemma's Dilemma](https://bilge.world/the-social-dilemma)" and "[Software Thanksgiving](https://bilge.world/big-thank)" in detail would be awfully redundant, but I would at least note how they represent diametrically opposed perspectives through which to discuss this stuff. Going forward into 2021, I think it's important that I hold short on the progress I've made in moderating my voice since 2018. *Digestibility* is not a virtue I am at all interested in, nor is it an appropriate one in which to invest any more effort. Any non-*radical* argument will inevitably prove enormously unoriginal, which makes for a huge waste of all our time. For the moment, that's all the editorializing I've done.

Blogging vs.

## Three Point Oh
Somewhere along the research process for one of my school essays, I came across the concept of academic [revision tracking and peer review via Git](https://www.davidblue.wtf/git-peer-review/). Having dipped my toe back in academia, any such circumvention of its penchant for the most archaic practices possible was naturally intriguing. *Just wait until I show these goons how to use hyperlinks.* Perhaps inevitably, I was launched into the Git-Gone Bender I'm still riding simply because I finally had ample reason to actually understand it. In just two months, I've created and forked a total of nearly 80 repositories on [my new GitHub account](https://github.com/extratone). Though I'd created one for each of my web properties ages ago, I had absolutely no idea how to actually make use of them, so they were all quickly abandoned. In the past two weeks or so, I think I've actually begun to get the hang of the system's core intricacies, best exemplified by [*The Psalms*' Repository](https://github.com/extratone/bilge) as it stands.

The "automated" [Project Board](https://github.com/extratone/bilge/projects/1) I set up has so far been a very impressive replacement for the simple todo list. It tracks and categorizes Post Ideas in their various stages in my process: Mulling, Documentation (research,) Drafting, and actual Publication. Technical "[Issues](https://github.com/extratone/bilge/issues)" regarding the CMS and/or the Repository, itself, have also fit in these categories well, so far. Just today, I discovered that one can simply tag Issues by their number to describe [Commits](https://github.com/extratone/bilge/commits/main), which form an impressive revision-tracking changelog when aggregated together. I also figured out the general idea behind Milestones and set [*The Psalms*' first one](https://github.com/extratone/bilge/milestone/1) for my 27th birthday, next month. The goal is to have figured this all out well enough by then that I'm no longer randomly stumbling upon entire featuresets multiple times in a workday. [*Thinking in Public*](https://tomcritchlow.com/2020/07/23/thinking-in-public/) - as my friend Tom Critchlow and his crowd say - is what I'm trying to do here, I think. Obviously, this really means that you are more than welcome to hop the fuck in at any time, in any manner you'd prefer. If Git is still no more than a conundrum for you - as it was for me just weeks ago - I would suggest the directory for [In-Progress Drafts](https://github.com/extratone/bilge/tree/main/Drafts) as a starting point.

[GitHub Actions](https://github.com/extratone/bilge/actions) are still more or less a mystery to me, but I am unbothered - *The Psalms*' seems to be producing green text instead of red, now, in the midst of whatever I set it up to do. I poked around the livestreams for "GitHub Universe" a few weeks ago, when dark mode and GitHub Discussions were opened up to more users. At the moment, I cannot imagine a single application for forums in the context of my blog's repository, but [I turned them on, anyway](https://github.com/extratone/bilge/discussions). It's very possible that all of the documentation-generating functions of Git are entirely unnecessary in this case, but - as I entrust GitHub with the eternal task of archiving such work - it is my hope that it will help me add further structure to my process.

# Microsoft Surface, As Yet Unnamed




# Hello again, friends.

## Returning Home... Again.
In June, I sorta sprung a single letter on you and mentioned that it would be the chosen means of publishing these, claiming – incorrectly, it would seem – to have been more or less forced to seek out the badly-designed and certainly less-discreet Revue, due to resounding rumors of TinyLetter’s imminent death. To be frank, I’m a bit confused by the affection for the rudimentary old service – all the cool personal tech and culture writer lists I once sought out and enjoyed have almost all fallen silent since 2016. I know the specifics of these companies, their products, and the interrelationships between them all don’t exactly make for thrilling reads, even for the most tech-embedded among us. Nevertheless, they have occupied a great portion of my learning, focus, and attention, and so this evening’s Psalm is inevitably populated with my experiences exploring the “future of WordPress,” my surprise-filled reacquaintance with Linux (both its literal and abstract existence,) Open Source computing in general, my month spent without reliable internet, and federated social networking. In case you hadn’t noticed, I’ve really come to enjoy the freedom “blogging” offers

(An excerpt of a draft of what will finally go out as Edition #9 of *The Psalms*, the newletter.

# Big Lapse in Distraction
This song came on the Bandcamp Weekly two nights ago and I just started crying a little bit. It’s hard to communicate why, and I’m not sure I even want to anymore. Everything and everyone is gone. I am left with those who have always loved me, yet I feel completely alone, which suggests that love must be conditional to be effective.

(Of course I know why it’s making me cry - the texture of this track is identical to the music I surrounded us with when we were falling in love and my brain just ​**can’t stop wanting for it**​.)





Quite vulgar. I'd never imagine girls would find me attractive in this way. Maya and Catherine are pretty crazy, though, so I'm not sure I should value the niceties they said to me too highly.

I think I am most attracted to quiet, rational, and deliberate young women, but the only individuals who've voiced their attraction to me have been quite loud. I think I can honestly say independently of my love for Meagan that she is the "best fit" I've yet to find for myself. Especially after leaving my edgy phase - I think there would be much less abrasion were we to get back together. Considering that she hasn't replied to my email, though, I assume she is committed to 100% no contact. Kailin was an intermediary for our last correspondences, regrettably, and I revisited her last relayed (I hope) messages.

∆

**I don't really know what to say. She says: She is done having any contact with you, that she said what she wanted to say, and that she is just going to mail you your stuff.**

**She says she doesn't want to have contact, I don't know why. And she's specifically said she doesn't owe you anything.**

∆

Yeah... I should've read those first, I guess. It's funny that she interspersed "encouragements" like *everything will be okay* as if she possessed some wisdom I was ignorant of. It's all universal to her. At least I don't have to live that way. I'm really not feeling all that bad about it right now because I have enough stimulants in my system, I assume. After ferociously scouring the Internet on Friday night (note: I was coming down from Vyvanse for the first time in years, and it took me a bit too long to realize the possibility of its influence) for similar situations. There weren't many, but nearly all the advice stated the importance of making the decision to get over her and... Good God. That is the last thing I want. I guess my only hope then for having a societally-approved "healthy" life and/or relationship is that I will eventually fail to hold on to her.

And of coursε, Ι *still* find myself wanting to have this discussion with her, not a cloud-enabled cyberdiary. I guess I must be delusional and sick. Another obstacle to my *healthy recovery*: it is perhaps my most robust commitment to never live like them - to make up one's companionship with a little society of friends. If I am ever able to somehow extract her from my heart so that I may love someone else without literally destroying the core of myself, I may live again. The ability to even begin to conceptualize such an operation is *very* far in the future, though. In these 17 months, I have proven to myself, at least, that there was nothing lacking in my love for Meagan - I really *did* have what I wanted for those 5 years, even if I took it for granted at the time. And she inadvertently taught me so much, too. When I was crafting The Mechanism as a little boy, I always imagined it would involve grand mutual adventures, but all that time spent simply *existing* next to Meagan as she played *Animal Crossing* or *Harvest Moon*, or slaved away in her studies... That was the purest bliss I've ever experienced. (Or - given any current SITREP, the purest I ever *will* experience.)

And despite the magnitude of what you'd probably call *self-inflicted* suffering, I am immensely proud to have achieved what I did. I attained what I wanted most from existence - something even the longest-livers have an extraordinarily slim chance of reaching.

And my eyes are not sunken, nor my skin pale. I may be in tremendous financial and emotional debt, but I retain my fleeting vanity. And - in some rare moments of brief reanimation - I slip back into the cleanliness of youthful heart that allowed me to fall so deeply in love. Sitting in front of Kaldi's by the bluegrass band, I saw a serene young woman with beautiful curly hair confidently and silently striding by amongst a group of peers in a very cute white-striped medium blue summer dress, and I felt a brief flash of a pang in my heart - that ancient reflex that spins a romantic narrative for such a stranger in an instant, and resets the mind back to the intensity of The Mechanism when it was unused and primed for lifetime companionship.

If I were able to capture it long enough to observe something tangible from it, I'm afraid it would register as delusion. Those immediate fantasies take place outside of reality, in all likelihood. Send us away to an isolated sanctuary so that we may only look at each other, talk to only one another, and be guaranteed this Ultimate companionship for the rest of our existence. I'm not sure I'd ever write another word again - human creativity is borne of war, not total contentment. And have I been at war? Is it some form of warfare to conjure your identity from seemingly nothing, and ultimately be unable to even begin the process of concession with your environment? Is it strength, or is it weakness? Is it noble or cowardly? I tell you truthfully, I am completely unconcerned with the words, but that was not always the case. Fundamentally, I'm sure I believe I have *evolved* into superior form after superior form over my biography, but observers (mostly mom, I suppose,) insist that I am actually stagnant.

Good God folks. If nothing else, my bank account should be more than enough evidence to the contrary.



Sleep schedule is massively screwed up.
Mom woke me up around 11 and insisted that I need to get a job..... Even though I have an application for CASR. I'm going to wait to turn it in until tomorrow because I broke my razor a few days ago and my face is scraggly as fuck.

Working on Fleet and the Furious: Drakesville Drift (just the promo video now.) This software is awful....but oh well. I'm going to attempt to write an actual screenplay for this film, and we're going to put effort into its production (hopefully.)

I was scheduled to play a Drywall set at the birthday party of a girl we met a Dryfest but I canceled last night. I didn't have anything prepared. (The show is on the 22nd.)

I've been watching House of Cards on Netflix as a sort of substitute for Mad Men.

The end of the summer semester is approaching and my grades are awful (especially in Algebra.)

Money is very low from paying the speeding ticket.

Spent the last of the cash I had from Bojangles' catsitting on McDonald's.

I wonder if I should keep track of what I eat in this journal so I don't overdo it on fast food.

# Aquaman (2018)
Well… What I picked up from this film was unlike any other superhero movie I’ve ever seen, which is important to celebrate considering the endlessly-regurgative Marvel hell we’ve found ourselves enslaved to. Unfortunately, the cinematography and special effects were… wrong, somehow. I say so with no small amount of caution - I don’t want to condemn a single filmmaking decision simply because it’s different from what I’m used to. Again - considering that films have become such stagnant, digestible products - *any* sort of genuine originality and/or innovation in the process of a major title’s production should be praised… dare I say it… even if it’s just…bad.

I did *not* really give *Aquaman* my full attention, though, nor have I read anything else about it. I guess I hope some folks loved it for its particular departures in that way which makes films truly special in their memory.

# Moshi Overture

- [ ] WHAT THE FUCK IS **VEGAN LEATHER**

# Walt Mossberg’s First Generation iPhone Review
Walt Mossberg’s First Generation iPhone Review.mp4
## Transcription
Hi this is what Maasberg personal technology columnist from the Wall Street Journal and this is the week for months people have been going crazy about this forthcoming device called the iPhone from Apple.
Here it is it goes on sale Friday at 6:00 PM.
And in the 16 years I have been reviewing tech products, I cannot remember any product having this kind of hype and high expectations surrounding it.
So it was quite interesting for me to be testing it the last two weeks I conducted my tests in a number of cities on both.
At East and West coasts I used it in airports and Starbucks and my house and office and Fenway Park in Boston on streets and.
::It is certainly the most beautiful and the most radical smartphone or handheld computer I have ever tested.::
Starting with the physical you can see it's very thin.
It's actually thinner than, for instance, the Samsung Blackjack, which is quite a skinny phone.
And yet it has this enormous 3 1/2 inch screen which takes up most of the front of it.
It does not have a keyboard, it uses a virtual keyboard on the screen and when this was first announced by Apple in January, when the phone was disclosed, I was among many, many people who thought this was a real dealbreaker feature.
I have to say that.
Three days into testing the thing I wanted to throw it out the window because the keyboard was so difficult to use and I was so slow and making so many errors on it, but.
Five days in I suddenly found that I could type as well as fast as I have been typing on my trio's physical keyboard for years, so my conclusion is that the keyboard issue on the iPhone is a non issue.
The phone has a tremendous web browser.
The best I have ever seen on a handheld device.
It actually shows you the real layout and the real totality of the web pages you're looking at.
It doesn't rearrange them or stack them or do all the funny things that you're used to on a phone.
And if you want to zoom in and read a section of a web page, you just double tap with your finger.
The email program on it is also very PC or computer like it shows you a preview of the email and if, let's say there's a photo that's been sent in the email that photo you don't have to click separately to see it.
It shows up right there in the email.
The phone part of it is fine.
I wouldn't say it was the best voice quality I've ever heard on a phone, but it was OK.
The big drawback to the iPhone, in my opinion, is the fact that it only runs on one carrier in the United States, and that's AT&T. Apple, an AT&T, did an exclusive deal. It is not a short term exclusive deal either. I do not expect anytime in the foreseeable future.
To see this phone in a version from Verizon or Sprint or T-Mobile. And in fact it's locked so that you you can't even put in a T-Mobile card an use it on the T-Mobile Net.
Work now AT&T is the biggest carrier in the US, So why do I consider that a downside? Well, we all know that a coverage batteries, and if you're in an area without a great AT&T coverage, no matter how much you lust after this thing, it's not going to be very useful. If you can't make calls on it. The other problem is.
That's the data part of this, and remember I said it has a wonderful email program and a wonderful web browser, but those depend, of course on a fast connection to the Internet.
And this phone runs on a cell network that AT&T has that's called Edge, which is quite slow compared to the faster networks that even AT&T has on some other phones, and that Verizon and Sprint have on some treos and Blackberries and other competitors. So if you are relying on the cell phone network.
For Internet access on this, it is fairly slow.
The saving grace is.
the iPhone also has Wi-Fi.
There are a few other smartphones with that, but not many.
And Apple has designed the Wi-Fi part of this beautifully, so that when you walk into a room or a Starbucks or someplace where there's a Wi-Fi network, the phone knows about, it instantly switches you.
To Wi-Fi for your Internet access and of course.
That really flies, but when you're on the move, if you're in a cab, going through a city and you're trying to do web browsing or email, you're pretty much stuck with the slower cell phone network called Edge. Well, there's a lot more to say about this, and I've covered a lot more of the details in my column in the Wall Street Journal an on wsj.com, and on.
All things did come, but this is a fascinating product that I think raises the bar for all other smartphones.
This is Walt Mossberg, an I'll see you next week.

# General Handset Opining
I was just about to Tweet “I’m surprised there’s not a better solution for browsing/interacting with Stack Overflow on iOS” before stopping myself and realizing what’s probably the general word among the stack types: *just use your web browser*. This led to a key differentiation I want to make. I often lament the recent emphasis on the development of Progressive Web Apps, Electron apps, and other variations of web browser-based containers masquerading as desktop-class software, saying the same thing: we really need to remember how powerful modern web browser are and accept that right now, a huge amount of what one should seek to do on a desktop-class operating system, specifically, instead of a mobile OS like iOS, is going to be done on the web from within a desktop web browser. I realize this direction of desktop development which I find detestable is the result of the industry’s fairly-recent emphasis on combining mobile and desktop operating systems/desire to create a platform mutable enough to work on both.

Obviously, there are benefits to be had from the influence mobile OSs have had on traditional desktop OS development. The recent, quite monumental rollout of ARM-based Macs has probably been the single most poignant real-world example, ever, but I just wish to say this

# Hardware Notes
- [ ] The iPhone 12 Pro Max exceeds the specs of even [my “new” desktop PC](https://bilge.world/hp-envy-desktop) in most aspects.
- [ ] iPhones are “designed to be put in a case,” nowadays, resolves Nilay Patel.
- [ ] The **Crud** issue...
[GSMArena’s Video Review](https://youtu.be/TfRtC5cQCpA) also shows crud around the lenses.
## Display
> OLED can be seen as a replacement for LCD, or liquid crystal displays. You might be reading this article on an LCD screen right now, given how ubiquitous the technology has been since its inception in the early 1960s. For reference, every iPhone before the iPhone X used LCD screens. Even the regular iPhone 11 last year used it, with the more expensive 11 Pro moving to OLED. For reference, the iPhone X and XS used OLED, too.  
> The most important functional difference between OLED and LCD that you need to know is the presence of a backlight. An OLED display uses that organic film we mentioned earlier to emit light when an electrical current runs through it. In other words, OLED can function all on its own without the need for a backlight. LCD has served humanity well for decades, but it needs a backlight to display anything.  
> [Everything you need to know about the OLED display rumored to be on the iPhone 12](https://mashable.com/article/oled-explained-iphone-apple/)  
> It’s difficult to remark with much insight on the OLED display vs. the LCD unit on my iPhone 8 Plus without the latter device in my posession to physically compare, but the contrast (literally, hehe) is especially obvious when a given app’s “high contrast dark mode” is selected. While my iPhone 8 Plus review began with a note on how insignificant True Tone appeared to be, it’s worth noting that it’s certainly a significant component of the experience, now - how much the upgraded display technology factors into this change, I know not.  
> The Big Issue among tech media is a refresh rate complaint... the iPhone 12 Pro line’s display is limited to 60Hz, while the rest of the market’s flagship lineup pushes to 120Hz and beyond. This is not something I am equipped to comment on, but I will say that 60 frames per second has always seemed like plenty to me.  

## Camera
> Front-facing 4K, 60fps capture is impressive, but useless — vloggers all have GoPros or DSLRs, these days, and sharing through Snapchat and Instagram will always be ultra-compressed.  
> I am not - nor have I ever been - one of these self-described *Camera Nerds*, but it strikes ~~ me that “real” camera nerds own one or more DSLRs and would surely prefer them over their handset’s camera in nearly every situation. Obviously, though, I am 100% out of touch when it comes to The Camera Issue. Two years later, and tech media appears to be unable to stop talking about smartphone cameras. The industry, predictably, seems to have gone right along with it. Now, I have in my posession an $1100 telephone designed around its camera system, which has sent me on a similar, completely bonkers camera-testing escapaade. In my defense, the thought *I should’ve just bought a DSLR* was [stuck in my mind](https://twitter.com/neoyokel/status/1344559416968966144?s=21) throughout the lot of it.  
> [Camera Test Embeds]  
> In short, I think we’re expecting far too much out of our smartphones and would end up gaining much in the end if we stopped. Battery life, for one.- [ ] I have been shooting RAW photos on iPhone for a while now... thanks to [Halide](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/halide-mark-ii-pro-camera/id885697368), which may or may not be completely worthless, now.  

## Battery and Magnets
I am genuinely worried about the future we continue to set ourselves up for, full of spent batteries and no way to responsibly despose of them.
---- [ ] I was able to drain the battery significantly faster than any tech journalists could.

- [ ] *“Two billion transistors.”*See: [[On iOS Excess]]. This is an important anecdote when talking with folks who are still genuinely flummoxed as to why headphone jacks aren’t built into iPhones anymore.

- [ ] An in-between mode for hardware keyboards would be nice. With Full Keyboard Access turned on, highlighted areas are distracting. Without it enabled, key functions are missing. (A shortcut for Siri, Notifications View, lock/unlock, to call up the shortcuts guide per app, etc.)

- [ ] *iFixit*’s **[iPhone 12 Pro Max teardown livestream](https://youtu.be/EXjDFdNVnXo)** is probably deserving of an embed, somewhere.

# Form
Leave it to  [Jon Rettinger](https://youtu.be/eRxq9IyZ4Cc)  to back me up on the size hype thing... Yes, the 12 Pro Max is *bigger*- and definitely prompts a conversation on how big we’re actually going to let smartphones get before we... idk.. call them something else(?) - but it’s far from *alarmingly huge* or anything, as  [Nilay Patel’s review](https://www.theverge.com/21555901/iphone-12-pro-max-review)  seems to suggest. It’s very possible that I say this out of Big Hand Privilege, though - auto journalist Matt Farrah (whom I trust completely) noted that he chose the 12 Mini because he can use it one-handed. It occurred to me, hearing this, that my own usership hasn’t really ever included this aspect. Nilay felt so strongly about the 12 Pro Max’s size that he recommends you find a way to experience its size in person before ordering one. My concern - as much as I love the idea of the 12 Mini - centers around the fact that I am already starting to struggle with the diminishing size of the buttons in the UX of popular apps like [TikTok](https://vm.tiktok.com/ZMe17ocYh/), and I’d rather not make my eyes struggle with text size any more than absolutely necessary. Handily enough, one can now access iOS’ text-enlarging slider from within the Control Center.

For myself and others, the flat sides of the design prompt a reflection on how this may be the first genuinely beautiful iPhone since the iPhone 4.

# Everything New in the iOS 14.5 Beta | MacRumors

Apple today [seeded the first betas](https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/01/apple-releases-ios-14-5-beta-1-to-developers/) of upcoming iOS 14.5 and iPadOS 14.5 updates, and while the new software serves as a deadline for when app developers [must comply](https://www.macrumors.com/2021/01/28/app-tracking-transparency-required-soon/) with App Tracking Transparency rules, there are also a handful of other changes worth noting.

## Apple Watch iPhone Unlocking
With iOS 14.5 and watchOS 7.4, Apple is making it easier to [unlock an iPhone](https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/01/ios-14-5-unlock-iphone-with-apple-watch/) when you're wearing a mask. There's a new "Unlock with Apple Watch" feature that allows the [iPhone](https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/) to use an unlocked and authenticated Apple Watch as a secondary authentication method.



That means you do not have to take off your mask or enter a passcode to unlock your ‌iPhone‌ when this feature is enabled. It requires both an ‌iPhone‌ running iOS 14.5 and an Apple Watch running watchOS 7.4 and it must be enabled in the Settings app by going to Face ID & Passcode and toggling on "Unlock with Apple Watch."



An unlocked Apple Watch can be paired with Face ID to unlock your ‌iPhone‌ without having to enter a passcode, but it cannot be used to authenticate [Apple Pay](https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-pay/) or [App Store](https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/) purchases. These will still require the full Face ID facial scan or a passcode.

## Dual-SIM 5G Support
Those who use the ‌iPhone‌'s Dual-SIM functionality will be happy to hear that iOS 14.5 finally introduces [global support for 5G](https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/01/ios-14-5-enables-5g-in-dual-sim-mode/) in Dual-SIM mode on the [iPhone 12](https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-12/) models.



The Dual-SIM feature on the ‌iPhone 12‌ allows for two lines of service on a single ‌iPhone‌, useful for traveling or keeping separate work and home numbers. Prior to iOS 14.5, Dual-SIM mode was limited to LTE in all countries except for China, but iOS 14.5 will allow Dual-SIM users to get 5G speeds on both lines.

## T-Mobile Standalone 5G Network Support
According to [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/tmobile/comments/lab6xm/latest_ios_beta_145_activates_tmo_nr_sa/), iOS 14.5 also introduces support for T-Mobile's [standalone 5G network](https://www.macrumors.com/2020/08/04/t-mobile-5g-standalone-network/). Standalone 5G support allows a direct connection to a 5G network without the need for piggybacking on an LTE network, which allows for better 5G range and lower latency in some situations.


## AirPlay 2 for Fitness+
iOS 14.5, iPadOS 14.5, and watchOS 7.4 [enable AirPlay 2 support](https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/01/apple-fitness-plus-airplay-2-support/) for Apple Fitness+, allowing Apple Fitness+ subscribers to [AirPlay](https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airplay/) their workouts to a compatible ‌AirPlay‌ 2-enabled smart TV or set-top box.

Workouts can be displayed on a bigger screen with this feature, but unfortunately, Apple Watch metrics are not able to be displayed on the TV when AirPlaying a workout from an ‌iPhone‌ or [iPad](https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/). Activity rings, workout time remaining, calories, burned, set length, and burn bars will not show up on the TV set and will instead need to be viewed on the connected ‌iPhone‌ or ‌iPad‌.

## Expanded Controller Support
With iOS and iPadOS 14.5, you [can now use](https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/01/ios-14-5-xbox-ps5-controller-support/) the latest PlayStation 5 DualSense and Xbox Series X controllers with the ‌iPhone‌ and the ‌iPad‌. It's also likely that the [Apple TV](https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/) supports the new controllers with the tvOS 14.5 update.



## Apple Card Family Support
Code [in the iOS 14.5 update](https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/01/apple-card-multi-user-support-ios-14-5/) indicates that Apple will add a new feature that will allow for multiple people to use the same [Apple Card](https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-card/) account, which will let family members share a single card.

The main ‌Apple Card‌ account holder will be able to invite family members to use the ‌Apple Card‌ account, with family spending available for viewing in the Wallet app. Account holders will be able to set spending limits so all family members, including children, can use the card.

Though the code is in the update, the ‌Apple Card‌ family sharing feature does not appear to be live for ‌Apple Card‌ holders as of yet.

## Siri Emergency Calls
According to [Rene Ritchie](https://twitter.com/reneritchie/status/1356309325820665857), iOS 14.5 has a feature that ::allows [Siri](https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/) to call emergency services with a "Hey ‌Siri‌, call emergency" command::. This appears to also work in earlier versions of iOS, so it may be a server-side change.

## App Tracking Transparency
When iOS 14.5 is released, developers will need to ask for and receive a user's permission to access their random advertising identifier, which is used to track activity across apps and websites.



You're probably already familiar with these upcoming changes because Facebook has been [making a big stink](https://www.macrumors.com/2020/12/16/facebook-takes-out-full-page-ads-to-attack-apple/) about them, but with this beta, you should see more apps start to comply with Apple's rules, presenting a popup that lets you agree to or disable ad tracking.

Apple has already implemented all of the framework for App Tracking Transparency, so these popups are also going to appear more frequently in earlier versions of [iOS 14](https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-14/). iOS 14.5 is more of a deadline than a feature update when it comes to Apple's new privacy rules, but it will mark the wide adoption of Apple's ‌iOS 14‌ anti-tracking functionality.



One notable aspect of this change is a requirement that developers not track you in *other ways* to skirt the preferences that you select for anti-tracking, so if you choose not to allow an app to track you with a random advertising identifier, that app is not allowed to use non-Apple sanctioned tools to get around the rules.

## Podcasts App
There are some minor design changes that were made to the Podcasts app. Podcasts under "Shows" are now more prominently listed with episode descriptions and an easier access "Resume" button. The Search tab also allows you to browse through different categories to find what you're looking for.



## Reminders App
There's now an option to sort lists in Reminders by Due Date, Creation Date, Priority, or Title, plus there is an option to print a Reminder list, which has been a feature that Reminders users have wanted for some time.



## News App
There's a new Search tab in the [Apple News](https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-news-plus/) app, and the News+ section has been redesigned with a "For You" feature and an easier to access Browse tab.



## Emergency Alerts Settings
If you go to Settings > Notifications and scroll all the way down to Emergency Alerts, ::you can now tap the setting to disable an "Always Deliver" feature that causes emergency alerts to not play a sound when the Volume/Ringer is silenced::. Alerts for earthquakes, tsunamis, and other similar emergency alerts will still cause your ‌iPhone‌ to sound an alarm, according to Apple's code.



## Horizontal Loading Screen
On the ‌iPad‌, the loading screen with the Apple logo now shows up in a horizontal orientation if your ‌iPad‌ is positioned that way.


## Emoji Search
You can now search for a specific emoji in iPadOS 14.5, a feature that was added to the ‌iPhone‌ with the launch of ‌iOS 14‌.



## Smaller Features
There are also quite a few smaller features that have been added in the iOS 14.5 update, which are listed below.

* Interfaces for typing to ‌Siri‌ and sending iMessages with ‌Siri‌ have received some minor design tweaks to use Apple's more compact UI.
* There are minor design changes when asking ‌Siri‌ to locate a person using the [Find My](https://www.macrumors.com/guide/find-my/) app.
* There are new sounds for locating Beats in the ‌Find My‌ app.
* There are some updates to the Hermes watch faces with new color additions.
* There are new colors for Beats icons.
* It should now be easier to set up an ‌iPad‌ with a cellular connection.
* German Girocards may now be able to be added to the Wallet app to be used with ‌Apple Pay‌.
* When your Apple Watch is up to date, there's a new message: "Your Apple Watch is up to date with all the latest bug fixes and security enhancements."
* When your ‌iPhone‌ is up to date, there's a new message: "Your ‌iPhone‌ is up to date with all the latest bug fixes and security enhancements."

## Code Changes
There are also a handful of changes to the underlying code that don't necessarily reflect new feature implementations at this time, but could potentially serve as an indication of what's coming in the future.

* ‌Siri‌ may be able to tell you about traffic conditions when in the car.
* There are hints of new ‌Siri‌ car commands that could be implemented in the future.
* There are mentions of U1 chip pairing for the car, which is perhaps related to some automobile manufacturers' plans to implement Ultra Wideband support for digital keys. BMW [announced](https://www.macrumors.com/2021/01/13/bmw-digital-key-plus-ultra-wideband/) a "Digital Key Plus" feature that uses Ultra Wideband in January.
* ::There are "Edutainment" plugin mentions.::
* iOS 14.5 has mentions in the code of financial health features that could perhaps analyze your spending to provide recommendations on improving your finances. It appears the feature may also help you plan out purchases and payment schedules for financed items.
* There are SensorKit UI Facial metrics and speech metrics that appear to be related to health studies. These features allow the ‌iPhone‌ to detect facial expressions and listen for laughing, shouting, and other emotion-related metrics.
* We may see new Shazam integrations, with Apple adding a new background Shazam process.
* ‌Siri‌ may be able to modify Contact entries in the future.
* There are some new wallpaper mentions, but no outward-facing wallpaper changes.
* There are new diagnostic sounds, possibly related to [AirPods Pro](https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-pro/) repair and testing.

# Editor 2.0 Alpha Page

***Alpha**, noun - From the Greek word meaning “this is not finished, many features are missing or not working yet, **do not use this for mission critical work**.” Supposedly, alpha is also the first letter of the Greek alphabet*.

This “Panda” alpha test is a standalone Mac app, so it lacks most of Bear’s other features. This makes it easier to work on new Editor features and crank out test builds.

Later, we’ll have a full Bear + Editor 2.0 beta. Yes, an Editor 2.0 test for iPad and iPhone.

* **Many features are missing**, others are unfinished. This is just a test build to get feedback on specific new features
* **Create backups of backups** Just to be safe, use this on new files and copies of existing files

We have more in store for Editor 2.0. But to start this alpha test, you can focus on these features.

# Keyboard Shortcuts Bug Feedback Report
Feb 4, 2021 at 13:40
Note: this issue has occurred with Full Keyboard Access turned ~OFF~.
During the course of normal usage in Safari, Bear, Drafts, and Tweetbot, I have experienced four instances now (seemingly untriggered,) where keyboard shortcuts have ceased working. (Example shortcuts: ⌘ + Up and Down arrows, Unmodified Up and Down arrows to scroll, ⌘ + [ and ], ⌘+L. I can list more examples if it’d be useful.)
I have tried toggling the handset’s Bluetooth function on/off both in the Command Center and in Settings with no effect. Keyboard reconnects but the shortcuts are still unresponsive. The same goes for switching the keyboard itself on and off. The only solution appears to be rebooting the handset.
At this time, I don’t know what causes this issue. It’s happened seemingly at random.
- - - -
Feb 4, 2021 at 23:56
The issue occurred again just a few minutes ago, so I searched out and installed the Bluetooth Logging Profile from the Developer website and (apparently) successfully triggered a syslog using the [both volume buttons + side button] command, though **I DID NOT REBOOT THE DEVICE** between installing the profile and triggering the syslog because it would have corrected the issue before I could log it.
I have attached both the syslog file and a short screen recording (including my audio commentary) of the shortcuts not working in Safari. If it’s important, I believe the device was still capturing this log while I was recording this screen recording.

# Track Changes Amazon Review
The [longest Amazon review at the time of this writing](https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1ASHU52UE8SDX/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0674417070), by Armando Fox, insists from its title that this book is for a "niche audience," but - perhaps I'm just severely out of touch - the most surprising bit of the experience was just how diverse and widely-applicable Word Processing history was/is. Like Armando, I would also call myself "an aficionado of both computing history and the history of the written and printed word," but I believe the relevance to the latter of these subjects should extend *Track Changes*' audience far beyond what one would first assume. "Does word processing belong to the history of writing or the history of computing? The answer is not obvious," notes Kirschenbaum in his Preface. I believe those interested in either should consider it **required reading**.

To those like myself who are particularly interested in word processors and their history, I say **buy this book immediately** as a given. I can't remember the last time I was so elated to have found such a book, largely out of relief, for I was beginning to think I would have to write it myself.

The volume of published reviews of this book - and the diversity of the publications that carried them - will surprise you. I set out to gather them all in one space, and found the task quite huge.

There *is* some drudgery, yes - extensive details on IBM's interworkings in the 1970s, perhaps - but Kirschenbaum does an excellent job at being thorough without inappropriate tedium. To call it *dull* would be a critique of the story, itself, rather than his writing.

![](TweetBot%206%20for%20iOS%20Review/zzH7jm4G.png)The Psalms 2020 WordCloud

## Screens and software subjects big & small discussed within my most moderate 35,000 words ever.
Believe it or not, the cyclical cold season has once again come to pass! Oh, the [W̘͖̯E̟̹À̫T̯̫͓̪̮͓̼H̝E̪͇̰̘̖͍ͅŔ͍̖̱̟̪](https://youtu.be/qg0ZPmSux_4)!! If the past two days on Twitter were any indication, it is indeed time for a year's-end retrospective on what has been published on this Web Site. Given the extent of the attention I've devoted to bilge.world this past year - both technically and editorially - I thought it would be nice to chuck in a bit more in the pursuit of whacking myself on the back. I understand that 2020 has been one helluva catastrophic marker of linear time for just about everyone on Earth - as I write this on its last day, the [inexplicable news of MF Doom's death](https://www.complex.com/music/2020/12/mf-doom-dead-49) has just surfaced and has already hit my adjacent communities remarkably hard.

## Spring
The earliest archive.org capture of this particular Writeas blog dates back only to [May 1st of this year](https://web.archive.org/web/20200501203946/https://bilge.world/), but its stylistic contrast with the site's current version is immense. I believe I was using [Max Henderson's Anxiety theme](https://write.as/themes/anxiety) virtually stock, albeit with some color rearrangements. By the [29th](http://web.archive.org/web/20200529000327/https://bilge.world/), I had already arrived upon the colors you see today. "[You Know I'm Blogging](https://bilge.world/you-know-im-blogging)" was just a meta update to say *howdy* after such a long drought, but "[Dirty Dave's Poweruser Tips](https://bilge.world/poweruser-tips-software-shortcuts)" actually proved popular (for me) among my newly-connected Fedi crowd, especially, thanks to [an annotated share by Writeas on Twitter](https://twitter.com/writeas__/status/1252704432497836034). Honestly, it was entirely worth it just for the accomplishment of [exposing my platform peer Dino Bansigan to **Alt+D**](https://journal.dinobansigan.com/dirty-daves-poweruser-tips-david-blue). Writeas Community Manager CJ Eller and I began corresponding, which led to [an interview](https://write.as/community/chat-with-david-blue) regarding writing tools, managing fiddly compulsions, and the wonder of Markdown.

> I think I'm just now coming around to understanding personal blogging and the freedom that entails. It's been a long while since I've had the urge to write about things on which I don't consider myself at least somewhat of an authority. I think – like many people – I originally just used my personal blog as a guinea pig for messing around with themes, and I'm just now actually catching up on some of the lesser items on my “to-write” list.  
I dug deep in my long-overdue todo list for "[Z̴͏a͞l͟g͝o͏ ̕G͟͝e͞n͞҉è̛ŗ͡a͝͞t̴o҉r͞ for iOS](https://bilge.world/zalgo-generator-ios-app-review)," which - along with [my 2018 review of Unichar](https://bilge.world/unichar-for-ios-app-review) - I felt was a necessary celebration of digital text as a weapon, which is very dear to me. "[Preferred Writing Instruments](https://bilge.world/preferred-writing-instruments)" was probably the singular analog departure *The Psalms* will ever see and my condensed commentary on [*Star Trek: Picard*](https://bilge.world/star-trek-picard-review), [*Star Trek: Discovery*](https://bilge.world/star-trek-discovery-review), and [the current state of *Star Trek: Online*](https://bilge.world/star-trek-online) should fulfill all need mention of science fiction, here, for a very long time. Given [yesterday's news regarding Slack's acquisition](https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/1/21719666/salesforce-slack-acquisition-purchase-announced), perhaps I should feel revalidated in my insistence that "[Discord is Better Than Slack](https://bilge.world/discord-slack-comparison)," but a developer friend of mine actually addressed my curiosity regarding why startups never mention Discord as a workplace option, despite its identical functionality: it's all about fuckin' *enterprise security*.

I had wanted to write about [*The Langoliers*](https://letterboxd.com/film/the-langoliers/) - Stephen King's flop of a made-for-TV movie/extended *Twilight Zone* episode - for a long while. It was probably the first program I watched as a child that genuinely disturbed me and always returns to my thoughts by barren-ish experiences. I had planned to watch the whole three hours all the way through and write whatever came to mind, but I only made it halfway or so in "[Craig Toomey's Coronavirus](https://bilge.world/the-langoliers-stephen-king)" before I ran completely out of steam. I dropped what I had without revision, to this day. Perhaps one day I shall return...

> In the right hour, the woodland springtime metamorphic processes of the neighboring Lake Geneva suburb’s in-betweens were in a paused state – the toads again hushed; the crickets tired, and the human populace, too. In the right hour, the fickle wind and the social owls were the only sound, and nothing moved but the sparse, light-footed doe in careful segments with her fawn.  
These two sentences begin the sixth chapter of my indefinitely-postponed novel, [*Blimp's Burden*](https://github.com/extratone/pith), and are almost certainly my best writing, ever. My vanity simply wouldn't allow them to go forgotten, so I [published the chapter as an excerpt on *The Psalms*](https://bilge.world/blimps-burden-chapter-6). It may seem an intimidating wall of text, but give it your attention and you'll be amused, I think.

## Summer
The general, distinctly 21st-century wisdom regarding one's content popularity seems to be something like *you never know what's going to blow up*. I experienced this phenomena quite severely for the first time in my writing life after posting "[Google Is Not God of The Web](https://bilge.world/google-page-experience)" on [HackerNews](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23383548) right before going out-of-touch for some 13 straight hours amidst a local BLM protest. I did not intend to write a baity title, nor did I expect anything to come of sharing it, there - I only did so simply because the thought crossed my mind. Honestly, it is probably the least-considered content I'd ever published on *The Psalms* - I only put it up when I did because I knew *all* of my energy was about to be absorbed for an entire weekend or more. I only started the thing because I felt it important to raise a small voice in reminder that tech media had started using language when discussing code/online development which had begun to assume the existence of a single, objective standard of measure for *good web design*. (Fuck your bootstrap baloney, [*The Drywall Website*](https://iowa.neocities.org/test) was a *real* *paradigm shit*.)

And yet... That single goddamned post would end up accruing more pageviews than all of my writing on the web, combined (I suspect.) Tens of thousands of words were written in hundreds of comments, which I did my best to parse in [a *for the hell of it* substack email](https://davidblue.substack.com/p/witness-google-god-and-local-history):

> Out of everything I’ve shared on *Bilge* recently, it’s hilarious that this particular post - on which I spent a cumulative total of perhaps 25 minutes writing and made less effort than ever to edit - became probably my most widely-shared work of all time.  
Once again, I *am* thankful for the readership and correspondence, I just *really fucking wish* it had been on literally *anything* else I've written about technology.

In retrospect, it really is bonkers that I was excited about yet another vague promise to *re-imagine email* in the days surrounding [the launch of Basecamp's HEY](https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/15/21286466/hey-email-basecamp-price-availability-platforms-launch), but I feel it's important to nurture what paltry genuine enthusiasm remains about technology and the future, so I decided to respond to the service's homepage prompt, asking interested visitors to write in with their own thoughts on email. I spent a morning clacking out "[Email and I: An Abridged History](https://bilge.world/hey-email-history)," which I hope will one day serve as a part-foundation for a thorough, composed extension to my [*Why I Write About Technology*](https://gist.github.com/extratone/91ebe16b0c620f309e70b40f5d4dcd9e) series. This would be *The Psalms* last relevant work for a few months, while I played around with [an experimental WordPress website](https://www.davidblue.wtf/wordpress-experimentation/) and dove into [*fuckin' school*](https://www.davidblue.wtf/college-return/) for the first time in seven years.

## Fall
I returned in late September with a partial recount of what I'd discovered: "[Indulging Once More in Digital Excess](https://bilge.world/digital-excess)." After exploring the concept of [*Digital Gardens*](https://tomcritchlow.com/blogchains/digital-gardens/), buying [my first pro-ready desktop PC](https://www.davidblue.wtf/hp-envy-desktop/) in 10 years, playing with Big Boy Adobe software for the first time, and reading [a delightful book](https://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674417076) documenting the history of word processing, I arrived upon the term *Software Historian* with which to partially describe myself. It doesn't mean all that much at the moment, but will no doubt be explored imminently on this Web Site.

Addressing "[The Social Dilemma's Dilemma](https://bilge.world/the-social-dilemma)" and "[Software Thanksgiving](https://bilge.world/big-thank)" in detail would be awfully redundant, but I would at least note how they represent diametrically opposed perspectives through which to discuss this stuff. Going forward into 2021, I think it's important that I hold short on the progress I've made in moderating my voice since 2018. *Digestibility* is not a virtue I am at all interested in, nor is it an appropriate one in which to invest any more effort. Any non-*radical* argument will inevitably prove enormously unoriginal, which makes for a huge waste of all our time. For the moment, that's all the editorializing I've done.

## Three Point Oh
Somewhere along the research process for one of my school essays, I came across the concept of academic [revision tracking and peer review via Git](https://www.davidblue.wtf/git-peer-review/). Having dipped my toe back in academia, any such circumvention of its penchant for the most archaic practices possible was naturally intriguing. *Just wait until I show these goons how to use hyperlinks.* Perhaps inevitably, I was launched into the Git-Gone Bender I'm still riding simply because I finally had ample reason to actually understand it. In just two months, I've created and forked a total of nearly 80 repositories on [my new GitHub account](https://github.com/extratone). Though I'd created one for each of my web properties ages ago, I had absolutely no idea how to actually make use of them, so they were all quickly abandoned. In the past two weeks or so, I think I've actually begun to get the hang of the system's core intricacies, best exemplified by [*The Psalms*' Repository](https://github.com/extratone/bilge) as it stands.

The "automated" [Project Board](https://github.com/extratone/bilge/projects/1) I set up has so far been a very impressive replacement for the simple todo list. It tracks and categorizes Post Ideas in their various stages in my process: Mulling, Documentation (research,) Drafting, and actual Publication. Technical "[Issues](https://github.com/extratone/bilge/issues)" regarding the CMS and/or the Repository, itself, have also fit in these categories well, so far. Just today, I discovered that one can simply tag Issues by their number to describe [Commits](https://github.com/extratone/bilge/commits/main), which form an impressive revision-tracking changelog when aggregated together. I also figured out the general idea behind Milestones and set [*The Psalms*' first one](https://github.com/extratone/bilge/milestone/1) for my 27th birthday, next month. The goal is to have figured this all out well enough by then that I'm no longer randomly stumbling upon entire featuresets multiple times in a workday. [*Thinking in Public*](https://tomcritchlow.com/2020/07/23/thinking-in-public/) - as my friend Tom Critchlow and his crowd say - is what I'm trying to do here, I think. Obviously, this really means that you are more than welcome to hop the fuck in at any time, in any manner you'd prefer. If Git is still no more than a conundrum for you - as it was for me just weeks ago - I would suggest the directory for [In-Progress Drafts](https://github.com/extratone/bilge/tree/main/Drafts) as a starting point.

[GitHub Actions](https://github.com/extratone/bilge/actions) are still more or less a mystery to me, but I am unbothered - *The Psalms*' seems to be producing green text instead of red, now, in the midst of whatever I set it up to do. I poked around the livestreams for "GitHub Universe" a few weeks ago, when dark mode and GitHub Discussions were opened up to more users. At the moment, I cannot imagine a single application for forums in the context of my blog's repository, but [I turned them on, anyway](https://github.com/extratone/bilge/discussions). It's very possible that all of the documentation-generating functions of Git are entirely unnecessary in this case, but - as I entrust GitHub with the eternal task of archiving such work - it is my hope that it will help me add further structure to my process.

If you've found yourself in possession of a .edu email address and are interested in GitHub related experimentation, see [this list of discounted/free dev programs/services for students](https://education.github.com/pack/offers), which includes a free subscription to "GitHub Pro." (Apparently, equivalent to a $4/month service.) Adobe has [similar discounts](https://www.adobe.com/creativecloud/buy/students.html), as you’re probably already aware, which have allowed me to pursue my goal of learning InDesign. So far, I’ve created a sort of [commemorative 404 page for *The Drynet*](https://www.behance.net/gallery/104230341/Four-Oh-Four) and a [font showcase of Georgia](https://www.behance.net/gallery/104229721/Moms-Georgia-Type-Specimen) for my mother. As much as I’d love to continue discussing the current state of Adobe apps, I’ve realized 1) I am quite distinct from a *professional user*, which is why I genuinely find GIMP more useful than Photoshop, for instance, and 2) given the length of my to-write list considering my current pace, I don’t know if I’d manage to get around to it in this lifetime.
[[SnapChat 2020 Review Video Embed](https://youtu.be/wrhh8zDH-AA)]
Between now and the 11th of this month, I will be migrating worthwhile posts from the experimental WordPress site (WTF) here and closing its hosting account. I haven’t been compelled to actually do anything with it in months, and the handy redirects, alone, are not worth the upcosts, however fair. Some content - including the corresponding posts for my Adobe experiments *will not* be imported from WTF here. I’m also going to rely on [the Web Archive](http://web.archive.org/web/20210204191628/https://www.davidblue.wtf/) for publishing the rest. Notable discoveries so far include “[Through an iPhone 4’s Lens](https://bilge.world/iphone4-photography),” which is a reminder of how revolutionary that particular handset was, and a few extra-Psalms pieces of content I’d like you to experience, like [this Notion gallery](https://www.notion.so/rotund/7f4664a737d1429eb94d33cb3486e9e0?v=aad96df288034d2dbe4dd667d6b7f543) of my single jaunt into drawing, [# DavidBlueDraws](https://twitter.com/hashtag/davidbluedraws). Best of all is my friend [Tevin’s episode of *Extratone*’s defunct flagship podcast](https://anchor.fm/extratone/episodes/Esporting-Psycholiterates--Favored-of-Email-en398f/a-a3vklt8). In the years since, he’s become quite the prolific [Twitch streamer](https://twitch.tv/YourBudTevin). (I’ve watched enough and know Tevin well enough to say that he’s particularly entertaining in this medium.)

## Coming Soon
For better or worse, all of these new exploratory avenues have so far led directly away from the business of *actually writing*, but - in my best self-estimation - I suspect I’m mostly done with fiddling, now, and ready to start thinking on the page, again. Predictably, I’ve let my upcoming [iPhone 12 Pro Max Review](https://github.com/extratone/bilge/issues/45) turn into quite a monstrosity over the past two months. It turns out, years of lapsed attention toward iOS development resulted in my feeling more out-of-the-loop than I expected, which I was compelled to remedy, naturally. If you’re so inclined, you can follow the minutia attached to my review process via [this dedicated Snapas gallery](https://snap.as/extratone/iphone-12-pro-max), [this shared iCloud album](https://bit.ly/12bbbp), my [personal YouTube channel](http://bit.ly/psalmsyt) , and [this Twitter collection](https://bit.ly/ip12pmtw).
[[Long Exposure Tweet Embed](https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/1344555610155712512)]
As per my newfound use of GitHub, I’ve played around with various ways of documenting this journey, specifically. First is [this Wiki page](https://github.com/extratone/bilge/wiki/David-Blue-on-iPhone-&-iOS) (which I shall do my best to remember to keep updated) listing the entirety of my writing history on iPhone and iOS. (It’s uh... A bit underwhelming, if I’m honest.) I’ve also just begun a [dedicated repository](https://github.com/extratone/i) for iOS-related documentation and resources, which will soon include a full, sensically-indexed list of iCloud share links to my entire Siri Shortcuts collection (I hope.) Immediately following the review, I intend to publish here a post [dedicated to functions Apple has failed to properly document](https://github.com/extratone/bilge/issues/56), which I expect to be the most widely-useful content on this domain. To see some of the suggestions I’ve received so far and/or to add your own, see [this mildly-successful thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/ios/comments/l5p7ly/underdocumented_ios_functions_stuff_you_wish) I posted in r/iOS.
When I have finally tired of talking about handsets once more, I hope to return my attention toward some other overwhelmingly-ambitious monstrosities like my [academic paper](https://github.com/extratone/bigblue) proposing federated, open-source social networks in favor of the Big Boys, my [report](https://github.com/extratone/bilge/issues/44) on the experience of returning to academia for a semester in 2020, and my [evaluation of Notion](https://github.com/extratone/bilge/issues/12) as perhaps the next Big Step in the evolution of notetaking software. Perhaps before tackling projects the size of these, I intend to compile another [listicle of handy tips](https://github.com/extratone/bilge/issues/28) for newcomers to Writeas. As I linked before, you can now view the entirety of *The Psalms’* status in as much detail as you’d like via [its Project Board on GitHub](https://github.com/extratone/bilge/projects/1). As always, you can delight me by directly engaging on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/neoyokel), [Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@DavidBlue), [Discord](http://bit.ly/holeguest), and/or via [email](mailto:davidblue@extratone.com). Let’s hope 2021’s equivalent of this review doesn’t take me until February to publish!

- [ ] Less original captured images than ever before.
- [ ] I’m not quite sure just how *cozy* to allow this process to become with GitHub.
- [ ] Mention the perception that writing is getting less elegant with the addendum that it is has more or less always felt that way. This could be good or very bad.

# Response to Tim
> Thanks to uncle sam sharing some money, Im going to be getting my saab tunned up. Id like for you to give it a spin once I do, the sweds know how to make a fun car and I wish to share my joy I have had with mine. [this is an invitation of friendship, hope that it is received well, without any stipulation , as it its much needed in the times that we find our self's in. Hope you are well Mr. Blue]  
> Thank you so much for reaching out! I’m sorry it’s taken me so long to respond... my social energy has dropped to absolute zero over these past few months. COVID is a convenient excuse but I also drunkenly wrecked my car in December 2019 and had my license taken away. As you can imagine, I’ve spent the time since holed up, trying to reflect on my decisions and not break anything. Also 100% sober now! And realizing just how much of my adult social activity was based around drinking. I’m so glad you’ve gotten to experience Saab life! And I hope you are thriving, of course. As for driving any automobile, it’s going to be at least until April, but if you can bear my company (I think I’ve changed quite a bit as a person since we talked last,) you should come see my old COMPAQ portable from the 80s sometime... It’s about the only interesting thing I’ve got left lol.  

# Reflecting on Apple Arcade and the Blistering Evolution of Mobile Gaming
## The world’s most valuable company takes on gaming distribution, as told from a non-gaemer’s perspective.
I’ve now spent 56 days with Apple’s current flagship handset (more on that coming soon) and the experience has been even more profound than I expected, for a variety of reasons. One of them has been an enlightening returning exploration of “Mobile Gaming,” thanks in large part to the free 3 month trial of Apple Arcade included with the purchase of the device. This space - now probably best described as this *industry* - has expanded exponentially since my last visit. One of the first apps I remember downloading when the App Store launched in the Summer of 2008 was a brutally simple *Pong* ripoff, which had zero options, zero multiplayer or connected functions whatsoever, yet managed to be buggy as fuck.

# The Precarious Legacy of the iPhone 8 — The Psalms

## A decade of iPhone has probably ruined my life, but will the 8 Plus finally end it?
*Is my True Tone bullshit on?*

“True Tone” is so forgettable, everybody had to mention it first. Quite simply, it uses an ambient light sensor to fiddle with white balance, warming the colors of the display as an immediately-obvious whole, yes, but an interesting contrast to show off is no longer inherently justified in being called a “feature” in Apple products, anymore. Essentially, no matter who you ask (aside from [Jon Rettinger](https://youtu.be/AXU8GqaMsQc?t=7m23s),) you *should not* buy an iPhone 8, though I did last Fall, not only because I had to suddenly decide on a handset in less than 24 hours, but — if anything — to say goodbye to the form, the operating system, and the tech company which I have depended upon and carried with me virtually every day for my entire adult life. I’d originally decided to abandon this review due to a variety of unexpected circumstances, but Apple and its iPhone have maintained their place in the news with their [battery scandal](https://www.apple.com/iphone-battery-and-performance/), and a third of a year with the 8 Plus has included some experiences which warrant a send-off before iOS 12 is released, making it (and myself) totally irrelevant forever.

As the longstanding benchmark of the smartphone industry’s state at any given time, the iPhone can be easy to reflect upon as a product once occupying a state of universal exemption from criticism, but it has, in fact, [never been so](http://theweek.com/articles/459748/7-reviews-original-iphone-from-2007). As Nilay Patel [noted](https://www.theverge.com/2017/9/19/16323570/apple-new-iphone-8-review-plus-2017), one might regard the 8 as the last compromise of “basically four years” of the same design. Since launch, it’s unsurprisingly stayed a wee bit too far behind on the spreadsheets for most Android-type folks — not that I’ve ever believed them truthfully incapable of comprehending what it means to *package* a product, given where their greasy startups all eventually ended up. ( **You cannot doubt me**  — I once took a year-long sabbatical from iOS with a [Sony Xperia Play](https://youtu.be/nSWgS0l0kc8), and my authority is absolute.) The rest are trying to decide whether or not to pay $200 more for “ [the phone of the future](https://www.wsj.com/articles/iphone-8-apples-middle-child-1505322945),” which knows when you’re watching it, and is only good for playing half an hour of stupid video games before it needs a charge.

So far, I have maintained that my first generation iPhone was the best handset of all time — one hell of an Email Machine that lasted me close to five years — throughout the last two with actual motherboard exposed to the elements in the corner of its cracked screen. That said, who knows how it’d feel to be coerced into using “iPhone OS 2” as it was called, then, for an entire workday in 2018? Two years prior to bringing home an 8 Plus, I [vowed](http://bit.ly/drycast47) that my 6S Plus would be my last ever Apple device, but this one *actually* feels like a last hurrah. Though the ability to *Tweet directly from the swipe-down notification menu* is still nowhere to be found (it’s been gone for 5 releases, now, and would seem to have been forgotten by *literally* everyone but myself,) one gets the sense that Apple’s efforts to add to the iPhone 8 and iOS 11 were to make amends with us by settling a few debts.

In part, they did. Native apps got a major overhaul — including Mail, which was startling, considering that I’d been looking at what was near as makes no difference the same UI my eldest phone shipped with. As a result, it alone constitutes my benchmark for an email service, and I have been left without a clue as to what *a good one* looks like. (Apparently it was [really bad](https://www.pcmag.com/article/342889/the-best-mobile-email-client-apps)?) Since time began, there has always been at least one alternative email app of the moment that tech journos refer to as the must-have, end-all replacement. [Edison Mail](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/email-edison-mail/id922793622?mt=8) is currently the smoother, faster, most modular option — at least for another few minutes– but I’ll never know it as I know Mail, and I’ll never want to. Playing around with experimental email apps is too scary. What if I decide once again to kill that massive number in the red badge and need to immediately mark 40,000 emails as read? It took all of my iPhone 4’s 1.0Ghz CPU and proprietary software over 18 hours — how am I supposed to trust a shabby little 6-month-old startup with such an important task? Anybody with a hundred bucks can make an app, you know.

### Why is the App Store now the best-looking publishing software on iOS?
One might interpret the App Store’s redesign as an attempt by Apple to control this conversation — of both the trending *new thing* and the old“essentials” that you’ve probably had tucked away in an untouched folder for years. Technically, whoever the hell is writing those gorgeously-presented daily bits has made them a publishing company, though I’m not so sure I’m not the last remaining user who’s continued semi-regularly visiting their “Today” section. If I *did* want to actually read about apps (I don’t — who does?) it wouldn’t make much sense to seek critical reviews from the faceless boffins behind the platform itself, regardless of how much better it may look than all of the tech news sites, paywall or no.

Native screen recording could conceivably come in handy once or twice, but I see no reason why the red bar must remain at the top of the render, but it has, which could explain the total lack of any such video in the wild. Front-facing 4K, 60fps capture is impressive, but useless — vloggers all have GoPros or DSLRs, these days, and sharing through Snapchat and Instagram will always be ultra-compressed. (Here are two sloppy test clips —  [at the zoo](https://youtu.be/VnfkWkotGFw), and [fishing](https://youtu.be/KOs5m6ynKAI).)

Perhaps some have figured out the new Files “app,” but it’s sat on my homescreen for months, untapped, and it will likely remain there for all time as a sort of soothing trophy — a thanks for my legacy iPhone loyalty. My reward for half a lifetime of syncing, scrolling, and tolling? **I can now view some of the files on my Mobile Computing Device**, and even *scan documents in*, which is mostly novel (though it is fun to digitize excerpts from physical text.) At some point, I must’ve mischecked a permanent option because all file types now open only in an app that does not recognize them. God bless.


Somehow, I’ve managed to fill my social circle with precisely zero iOS-using folks. All of my friends and colleagues use Android devices (including [Tim’s supercool Nextbit Robin](https://soundcloud.com/extratonemagazine/nextbit),) which provide a few handy datapoints (like the camera in [my fiance’s Galaxy S8](https://flic.kr/p/BXruaL),) but deprive me of any significant experience with the ostensibly intoxicating cult of iMessage. I’m constantly listening to and reading tech writers claim that it’s [one of the only reasons they’re still using iPhones](https://www.theverge.com/2016/10/10/13225514/apple-iphone-cant-switch-pixel-android-imessage-addiction), but my own food-OS loving biome has forced me to find others, and frankly, I can’t imagine looking at the [gluttonous](http://www.extratone.com/audio/futureland/toomanymessengers/) palate of available mobile, cross-platform messaging services (Telegram, [now Telegram X](https://telegram.org/blog/telegram-x), WhatsApp, Signal, Snapchat, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Discord, Slack, *Tinder?*, Google Hangouts, Google Allo, Google Chat, Viber, Skype, Line, Wire, etc.) and thinking… *well, none of this will do*!

Honestly — even if I’d actually been at all informed in my haste, the photographic capabilities of the 8 Plus, alone would’ve sold it. It’s not the new filters, gif functionality, or even “3D Photos” — it’s those mythical dual 12MP sensors (which it shares with something called the iPhone X.) They’re no less than infallible. After four months of [astonishing captures](http://bit.ly/ip8plus) in all manner of conditions, I don’t even care how exactly they do it anymore — it’s better to be left marveling. This first example was taken at Keystone, Colorado in the middle of a dark, cloudy Fall night — the amount of light they were able to find — “up to 80% more,” [according to Apple](https://www.apple.com/apple-events/september-2017/)  — is just *impossible*.

*The vast majority of the samples in my iPhone 8 Flickr Album were taken within the native Camera app as it ships and left unedited. (Especially before just a few weeks ago, when I [discovered Halide](https://extratone.com/race-day-at-hodges).*


Here is an unquestionably sensible progression from which iPhone has never wavered far since its fourth generation [set the standard](http://www.extratone.com/words/inred/iphone4/), but it’s one of an unfortunate few. Siri is still useless and silly apart from its “disable all alarms” feature and its ability to sound itself off in response when you’re hysterically screaming and digging for it through the vast plush of a forty-year-old Lincoln. The customizable Control Center makes toggling low power mode, orientation lock, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth less frustrating (note the last two [aren’t quite hard switches](https://www.wired.com/story/how-to-turn-off-wifi-and-bluetooth-in-ios11/),) though it should’ve come years ago. Notifications are slightly more sensible -certainly better than they were on Android Gingerbread, but I’ve heard things’ve changed quite a bit since then.

I *have* been tripped up by the lack of a 3.5mm audio jack a few times, but it just [wouldn’t make sense](http://www.extratone.com/words/inred/mono/) from a hardware perspective, and the new external stereo capability should refute those who can’t or won’t understand. Yes, it would be nice if Apple hadn’t led the industry to quite such a compromising obsession with thinness — we’d all trade *a lot* of substance for exponentially greater battery life, storage capacity, water resistance, etc. — but I don’t see much sense in expending your energy holding up signs in Silicon Valley.

> I’ll be here long after you’ve died, and you know why? Because I took the time to sync my apps.  
Two years ago, a new generation of social apps and the preposterous notion of a quad-core CPU in my iPhone 6S Plus seemed like the harbinger of a world I no longer understood. Now, most of those services have expanded to the far boundaries of my reach, and I’ve stopped counting chips. Refinement of the hardware design is reverent to the extreme. It’s pretentious, but Apple’s decision to pause on the 8 to consider details like stuffing the legal text in the software and adding a little bit of weight *back in* for ergonomics’ sake leads one to regard it as a monument to all the devices along the development timeline that have led to this… last triumph. Or, it would have perhaps, had they not [sold so many](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2018/02/apple-reports-first-quarter-results/).

One could argue that good execution of consumer electronic design means minimizing as much as possible the obstructions in the way of the user completing any given task, and the iPhone 8 Plus has surpassed the vast majority of these for myself — and I am, surely, a “power user.” iOS has changed a lot in the decade I’ve employed it — in far too many ways for the worse — but this pair of handset and software have reached *my* imagination’s limit for what I could possibly want to do. Augmented reality and wireless charging won’t ever have a place in my future, for better or worse. Face ID is much too peculiar. Surely, this iPhone is the ultimate expression of the first and fourth generation’s foundation.

If the 6S Plus was indeed the key to my immortality, I’m afraid the 8 Plus heralds my imminent demise. Whether or not it’s an early one is for you to decide. This *really is* my last iPhone.

# The Best iPad Keyboard Shortcuts for Improved Productivity
For those who use their iPad with an external keyboard, we’ve put together a list of more than 30 helpful iPad Keyboard Shortcuts to save you time and be more productive on your device. We’ve also included a cheat sheet of keyboard shortcuts to accompany some of our favorite iPad apps (such as Things, Ulysses, Lightroom, and more).


Despite the fact the iPad is a large glowing touchscreen, it almost feels like it was built to be used with a keyboard. In the same way the [Apple Pencil](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B07K1WWBJK/?tag=sweetsetup-20) unlocks all the iPad Pro’s drawing and annotation features, so too does an external keyboard unlock many of the iPad’s most powerful features.

An external keyboard — I’ve become an advocate for the [Smart Keyboard Folio](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B07JZYSWPY/?tag=sweetsetup-20), and I’m *very* excited for the upcoming [Brydge Keyboard](https://www.brydge.com/products/brydge-for-ipad-pro-2018) — is an absolutely essential purchase if you’re an iPad Pro owner.

Whenever I disconnect the iPad from the Smart Keyboard Folio to read a book or read the news on the couch, it takes about 30 seconds for me to wish I had an external keyboard still attached. Navigating through iOS using Spotlight, Drag & Drop, and Split View is how the large iPad Pro was made to be used, and zipping around iOS with the external keyboard is oftentimes faster than navigating around macOS with a keyboard and mouse.

I’m not an iPad keyboard wizard by any stretch (although I claim to be when it comes to Microsoft Excel on a Windows PC), so the following shortcuts may or may not strike the level of depth you’re looking for.

Nevertheless, I hope you’re able to pick up one or two new iPad keyboard shortcuts that help to cut down on your writing, navigating, or productivity time when using an iPad with an external keyboard.

We have a set of custom productivity templates that work well with the iPad app, GoodNotes. And if you want to try them out, we’ve put together a free guide that can help you.

We’ll show you…

* How to create and save custom page templates in GoodNotes.
* How to use those page templates to transform GoodNotes into your own productivity notebook (or any other type of notebook replacement).
Plus, we also have included a couple of our custom productivity templates for you to get started with. These templates are right out of our popular productivity course.



The custom templates and the guide are available for FREE to our email subscriber community. And you can get it right now. By joining the Sweet Setup community you’ll also get access to our other guides, early previews to big new reviews and workflow articles we are working on, weekly roundups of our best content, and more.

## Standard iPad Keyboard Shortcuts Every iPad Owner Needs to Know
These keyboard shortcuts are system-wide and 100% necessary to learn like the back of your hand, except for (perhaps) the Messages keyboard shortcut. Moving between conversations using the keyboard may not strike a chord with everyone. I find this shortcut fundamental to my everyday work.

**Command + H:** Whenever you’re inside an app, this keyboard shortcut takes you to the home screen. I often use this shortcut over and over when unlocking the iPad.


**Command + Space:** This iPad Keyboard shortcut opens the system-wide search, or Spotlight. You can search for so many things inside Spotlight, but the key to this shortcut is the ability to drag and drop an icon anywhere on your iPad from within Spotlight to Slide Over or Split View.


**Command + Tab:** Like on the Mac, this shortcut navigates between your last ten used apps. I wish the list of apps was longer.

**Command + Shift + 3:** Again, like the Mac, this shortcut takes a screenshot of everything on the display. The screenshot then hovers in the bottom left corner for you to save or act on it.

**Command + Shift + 4:** Similar to the aforementioned screenshot shortcut, this shortcut also takes a screenshot of everything on the display, but then directly puts you into the editing view in order to crop or annotate the image.

**Press and hold Command:** Only available on iOS (unfortunately), this shortcut produces a window highlighting all the keyboard shortcuts within a specific app.

**Command + Up/Down Arrows inside Messages:** And my favorite shortcut of all, this shortcut moves between conversations within Messages.

## Other System-Wide, iPad Keyboard Shortcuts That I Can’t Live Without
The above five or six shortcuts are likely shortcuts you’re aware of if you have even a semi-remote knowledge of OS keyboard navigation. The following shortcuts are a little less known (I only learned them with the debut of the latest iPad Pros) and which have become fundamental to how I work on the iPad.


**Command + Option + D:** This shortcut brings up the dock, allowing to open a different app or drag an app out of your dock for Split View or Slide Over.


**Command + Shift + 4:** Like the screenshot shortcut above, this shortcut automatically takes you to the image preview rather than resting the screenshot in the bottom left of your screen for a few seconds. This shortcut saves an extra tap if you know you want to act on your screenshot right away.


**Press and hold the down arrow (bottom right corner of screen):** Sometimes, you want to use the software keyboard rather than the external keyboard (this happens to me a lot when I want to snap a screenshot with the software keyboard displayed) and you *don’t* want to undock your iPad from the external keyboard (specifically the Smart Keyboard Folio without an eject key). This shortcut brings up the software keyboard without having to undock your iPad.

**Press Shift to uncapitalize letter at beginning of a sentence:** This shortcut was a lifesaver once I discovered it. For all those times when you want to start your sentence with a lowercase letter, or if you just don’t want to capitalize something, hit the shift key before typing your word and iOS won’t autocorrect the letter to a capital letter.

## Some Text-Specific Shortcuts
If you handle text on iOS, these shortcuts are sure to save you some time — and limit the still frustrating-to-use fingertip text selections you have to make.

**Option + Shift + Left/Right:** A little more common, this shortcut selects the previous/next word in the sentence.


**Shift + Left/Right:** This is a combination of the first two shortcuts — this shortcut begins text selection on the left/right of the cursor and highlights one character at a time.

**Shift + Command + Left/Right:** To select the entire line from the left/right of the cursor, use this shortcut.

**Shift + Option + Up/Down**: To select an entire paragraph above/below the cursor, use this shortcut.

**Shift + Command + Up/Down:** And if a *Command + A* shortcut isn’t what you need, use this shortcut to select all text in the document (above or below from the cursor).
- - - -
## Some Safari-Specific Shortcuts
Mobile Safari has a long way to go before it reaches the functionality level of any desktop browser, but its keyboard shortcuts aren’t too bad.

**Control + Tab:** Rather than trying to use your blunt finger to tap on the next tab, switch to the next tab using this shortcut. Note, this is *Control*, not *Command* (I forgot that a lot in the early days).

**Control + Shift + Tab:** Throw a *Shift* key in there to move to the previous tab.


**Command + F:** If you’re looking for a specific term on the webpage, this shortcut brings up the Find feature. This is one of those shortcuts so natural to an external keyboard that doesn’t translate at all when not using an external keyboard — you can only search the webpage from the share sheet, a long and convoluted workaround if you ask me.


**Command + L:** If it’s time to type in a new URL or if you’re wanting to quickly Google something, this shortcut highlights the text input/URL field.

**Command + Shift + T:** Did you accidentally close a tab too soon? This shortcut opens the last-closed tab, and you can also press it several times to continue restoring each previously closed tab.

**Command + [**: This shortcut goes back one page in your browsing history. Similar to swiping from the left to right, but without leaving the keyboard.

**Command + ]**: Same as above, but for moving forward in your browsing history.

We have a set of custom productivity templates that work well with the iPad app, GoodNotes. And if you want to try them out, we’ve put together a free guide that can help you.

We’ll show you…

* How to create and save custom page templates in GoodNotes.
* How to use those page templates to transform GoodNotes into your own productivity notebook (or any other type of notebook replacement).
Plus, we also have included a couple of our custom productivity templates for you to get started with. These templates are right out of our popular productivity course.

## Some App-Specific, iPad Keyboard Shortcuts
These are my most-used iPad keyboard shortcuts in my most-used third-party apps. In the case of Things 3, it’d be great to see iOS *as a whole* adopt the keyboard navigational ease present within the app.
### [Things 3](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/things-3-for-ipad/id904244226?at=11l7ja&ct=tss)
Things 3 is the ultimate iPad keyboard app. This type of app is seemingly built to be navigated using a keyboard and I feel Things 3 broke new ground with this feature.


**Down arrow key then enter on a task:** Things 3 can be navigated top to bottom using the keyboard, but this simple shortcut highlights a task in whichever view you find yourself in. Once highlighted, hit Enter/Return to drop down the task’s notes and tab through the task’s other options.

**Command + 1:** This shortcut opens your Inbox. Use this shortcut, then use a **Command + N** to begin your morning brain dump.

**Command + 2:** This shortcut opens your Today view. Use this shortcut, then **press the down arrow key** to act on the task.


**Command + S:** Specifically powerful when you’re in your Inbox, this shortcut opens up the task scheduler, allowing you choose a date for when you’d like to complete the task.


**Command + Shift + M:** I use this shortcut more than any other in Things 3. This shortcut opens the task mover dialog box, allowing you to move the task to any one of your areas or projects.

**Command + K:** Finally, when you’ve completed a task, this shortcut checks it off your list.
- - - -
### [Bear Notes](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/bear/id1016366447?at=11l7ja&ct=tss)
Ninety-nine percent of Bear can be navigated using the keyboard. You just need to learn how to do it.

**Command + Return:** If you’re currently editing a note, this shortcut ends editing and eliminates your cursor. From here, you can then use arrow keys to move between your lists of notes.

**Command + 1:** This shortcut brings you to your master list of notes, at which point you can use the arrow keys to move between your individual notes.


**Command + 2:** I use this shortcut quite often. I send all sorts of random stuff into Bear, and I triage or process my notes by tagging them. In essence, the “Untagged” view is like my “Inbox.” This shortcut takes me straight to my untagged notes.

**Command + Shift + F:** This shortcut is a bit different than the standard *Command + F* shortcut. This shortcut specifically searches your note list rather than the contents of a specific note.


**Command + Option + Left/Right Arrows:** When in your note view, this shortcut navigates to the next note in your list.

### [Ulysses](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ulysses/id1225571038?at=11l7ja&ct=tss)
Like Bear, a quick Google search for how to navigate inside Ulysses on iPad yielded a surprising number of helpful keyboard shortcuts.


**Command + Option + Left/Right Arrows:** This shortcut moves Ulysses left and right, taking you from the text editor to your sheet list to your groups and filters, or into your attachments bar to the right.

**Command + Option + Up/Down Arrows:** Like the shortcut above, this shortcut jumps you to the previous or next sheet in your sheet list.


**Command + Shift + K:** This shortcut automatically opens the keyword selector for your selected sheet — perfect if you like to tag your sheets inside Ulysses.


**Command + Option + T:** When inside the text editor, this keyboard shortcut brings in Typewriter Mode, keeping your current line of text in the same spot to keep you focused on your current writing.


**Command + 6:** This shortcut acts as a “Quick Export” — it brings up the sheet’s export view, allowing you to skip over having to scroll to the top and tapping on the share sheet to preview your text in a variety of formats.
- - - -
### [Adobe Lightroom CC](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/adobe-lightroom-cc-for-ipad/id804177739?at=11l7ja&ct=tss)
Adobe Lightroom CC doesn’t seem like the typical app for extensive keyboard shortcuts, which, in truth, Lightroom doesn’t really have. Darkroom for iPad has a better array of keyboard shortcuts in my opinion. However, Lightroom’s keyboard shortcuts carry over from the Mac version in many ways, ensuring your muscle memory doesn’t have to change when you move to iOS.


**P:** When previewing an photo, this shortcut flags your photo as a “Picked” photo.

**G:** When previewing or editing a photo, this takes you back to the Grid View.

**Y:** This keystroke cycles you through a before and after of your current photo.

**Command + C, then Command + V on a new photo:** Copy and paste are prevalent across all apps on iOS, but Lightroom’s version of copy/paste allows you to copy specific edits from your current photo and paste them onto a different photo. Unfortunately, batch pasting is not yet available in Lightroom CC for iPad.

I could probably write another 2,500 words highlighting different shortcuts I use throughout iOS. One of my most-used iPad apps these days is [Spark](https://thesweetsetup.com/apps/best-ipad-email-app/), and you can do a ton inside Spark with an external keyboard. However, most of Spark’s iPad keyboard shortcuts are identical to shortcuts found in other email apps. For example: **Command + R** allows you to reply to a message, and so on.

(It still baffles me that Apple’s default keyboard shortcut to send a message in Mail.app is **Command + Shift + D**. Thank goodness Spark’s sending shortcut is **Command + Return**, like every other civilized email app on the planet.)

Nevertheless, I hope you’re able to pick up one or two new iPad keyboard shortcuts that help to cut down on your writing, navigating, or productivity time when using an iPad with an external keyboard.

We have a set of custom productivity templates that work well with the iPad app, GoodNotes. And if you want to try them out, we’ve put together a free guide that can help you.

We’ll show you…

* How to create and save custom page templates in GoodNotes.
* How to use those page templates to transform GoodNotes into your own productivity notebook (or any other type of notebook replacement).
Plus, we also have included a couple of our custom productivity templates for you to get started with. These templates are right out of our popular productivity course.

## Standard iPad Keyboard Shortcuts Every iPad Owner Needs to Know
These keyboard shortcuts are system-wide and 100% necessary to learn like the back of your hand, except for (perhaps) the Messages keyboard shortcut. Moving between conversations using the keyboard may not strike a chord with everyone. I find this shortcut fundamental to my everyday work.

**Command + H:** Whenever you’re inside an app, this keyboard shortcut takes you to the home screen. I often use this shortcut over and over when unlocking the iPad.


**Command + Space:** This iPad Keyboard shortcut opens the system-wide search, or Spotlight. You can search for so many things inside Spotlight, but the key to this shortcut is the ability to drag and drop an icon anywhere on your iPad from within Spotlight to Slide Over or Split View.


**Command + Tab:** Like on the Mac, this shortcut navigates between your last ten used apps. I wish the list of apps was longer.

**Command + Shift + 3:** Again, like the Mac, this shortcut takes a screenshot of everything on the display. The screenshot then hovers in the bottom left corner for you to save or act on it.

**Command + Shift + 4:** Similar to the aforementioned screenshot shortcut, this shortcut also takes a screenshot of everything on the display, but then directly puts you into the editing view in order to crop or annotate the image.

**Press and hold Command:** Only available on iOS (unfortunately), this shortcut produces a window highlighting all the keyboard shortcuts within a specific app.

**Command + Up/Down Arrows inside Messages:** And my favorite shortcut of all, this shortcut moves between conversations within Messages.

## Other System-Wide, iPad Keyboard Shortcuts That I Can’t Live Without
The above five or six shortcuts are likely shortcuts you’re aware of if you have even a semi-remote knowledge of OS keyboard navigation. The following shortcuts are a little less known (I only learned them with the debut of the latest iPad Pros) and which have become fundamental to how I work on the iPad.


**Command + Option + D:** This shortcut brings up the dock, allowing to open a different app or drag an app out of your dock for Split View or Slide Over.


**Command + Shift + 4:** Like the screenshot shortcut above, this shortcut automatically takes you to the image preview rather than resting the screenshot in the bottom left of your screen for a few seconds. This shortcut saves an extra tap if you know you want to act on your screenshot right away.


**Press and hold the down arrow (bottom right corner of screen):** Sometimes, you want to use the software keyboard rather than the external keyboard (this happens to me a lot when I want to snap a screenshot with the software keyboard displayed) and you *don’t* want to undock your iPad from the external keyboard (specifically the Smart Keyboard Folio without an eject key). This shortcut brings up the software keyboard without having to undock your iPad.

**Press Shift to uncapitalize letter at beginning of a sentence:** This shortcut was a lifesaver once I discovered it. For all those times when you want to start your sentence with a lowercase letter, or if you just don’t want to capitalize something, hit the shift key before typing your word and iOS won’t autocorrect the letter to a capital letter.

## Some Text-Specific Shortcuts
If you handle text on iOS, these shortcuts are sure to save you some time — and limit the still frustrating-to-use fingertip text selections you have to make.

**Option + Shift + Left/Right:** A little more common, this shortcut selects the previous/next word in the sentence.


**Shift + Left/Right:** This is a combination of the first two shortcuts — this shortcut begins text selection on the left/right of the cursor and highlights one character at a time.

**Shift + Command + Left/Right:** To select the entire line from the left/right of the cursor, use this shortcut.

**Shift + Option + Up/Down**: To select an entire paragraph above/below the cursor, use this shortcut.

**Shift + Command + Up/Down:** And if a *Command + A* shortcut isn’t what you need, use this shortcut to select all text in the document (above or below from the cursor).

## Some Safari-Specific Shortcuts
Mobile Safari has a long way to go before it reaches the functionality level of any desktop browser, but its keyboard shortcuts aren’t too bad.

**Control + Tab:** Rather than trying to use your blunt finger to tap on the next tab, switch to the next tab using this shortcut. Note, this is *Control*, not *Command* (I forgot that a lot in the early days).

**Control + Shift + Tab:** Throw a *Shift* key in there to move to the previous tab.


**Command + F:** If you’re looking for a specific term on the webpage, this shortcut brings up the Find feature. This is one of those shortcuts so natural to an external keyboard that doesn’t translate at all when not using an external keyboard — you can only search the webpage from the share sheet, a long and convoluted workaround if you ask me.


**Command + L:** If it’s time to type in a new URL or if you’re wanting to quickly Google something, this shortcut highlights the text input/URL field.

**Command + Shift + T:** Did you accidentally close a tab too soon? This shortcut opens the last-closed tab, and you can also press it several times to continue restoring each previously closed tab.

**Command + [**: This shortcut goes back one page in your browsing history. Similar to swiping from the left to right, but without leaving the keyboard.

**Command + ]**: Same as above, but for moving forward in your browsing history.

We have a set of custom productivity templates that work well with the iPad app, GoodNotes. And if you want to try them out, we’ve put together a free guide that can help you.

## Some App-Specific, iPad Keyboard Shortcuts
These are my most-used iPad keyboard shortcuts in my most-used third-party apps. In the case of Things 3, it’d be great to see iOS *as a whole* adopt the keyboard navigational ease present within the app.

### [Things 3](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/things-3-for-ipad/id904244226?at=11l7ja&ct=tss)
Things 3 is the ultimate iPad keyboard app. This type of app is seemingly built to be navigated using a keyboard and I feel Things 3 broke new ground with this feature.


**Down arrow key then enter on a task:** Things 3 can be navigated top to bottom using the keyboard, but this simple shortcut highlights a task in whichever view you find yourself in. Once highlighted, hit Enter/Return to drop down the task’s notes and tab through the task’s other options.

**Command + 1:** This shortcut opens your Inbox. Use this shortcut, then use a **Command + N** to begin your morning brain dump.

**Command + 2:** This shortcut opens your Today view. Use this shortcut, then **press the down arrow key** to act on the task.


**Command + S:** Specifically powerful when you’re in your Inbox, this shortcut opens up the task scheduler, allowing you choose a date for when you’d like to complete the task.


**Command + Shift + M:** I use this shortcut more than any other in Things 3. This shortcut opens the task mover dialog box, allowing you to move the task to any one of your areas or projects.

**Command + K:** Finally, when you’ve completed a task, this shortcut checks it off your list.

### [Bear Notes](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/bear/id1016366447?at=11l7ja&ct=tss)
Ninety-nine percent of Bear can be navigated using the keyboard. You just need to learn how to do it.

**Command + Return:** If you’re currently editing a note, this shortcut ends editing and eliminates your cursor. From here, you can then use arrow keys to move between your lists of notes.

**Command + 1:** This shortcut brings you to your master list of notes, at which point you can use the arrow keys to move between your individual notes.


**Command + 2:** I use this shortcut quite often. I send all sorts of random stuff into Bear, and I triage or process my notes by tagging them. In essence, the “Untagged” view is like my “Inbox.” This shortcut takes me straight to my untagged notes.

**Command + Shift + F:** This shortcut is a bit different than the standard *Command + F* shortcut. This shortcut specifically searches your note list rather than the contents of a specific note.


**Command + Option + Left/Right Arrows:** When in your note view, this shortcut navigates to the next note in your list.

### [Ulysses](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ulysses/id1225571038?at=11l7ja&ct=tss)
Like Bear, a quick Google search for how to navigate inside Ulysses on iPad yielded a surprising number of helpful keyboard shortcuts.


**Command + Option + Left/Right Arrows:** This shortcut moves Ulysses left and right, taking you from the text editor to your sheet list to your groups and filters, or into your attachments bar to the right.

**Command + Option + Up/Down Arrows:** Like the shortcut above, this shortcut jumps you to the previous or next sheet in your sheet list.


**Command + Shift + K:** This shortcut automatically opens the keyword selector for your selected sheet — perfect if you like to tag your sheets inside Ulysses.


**Command + Option + T:** When inside the text editor, this keyboard shortcut brings in Typewriter Mode, keeping your current line of text in the same spot to keep you focused on your current writing.


**Command + 6:** This shortcut acts as a “Quick Export” — it brings up the sheet’s export view, allowing you to skip over having to scroll to the top and tapping on the share sheet to preview your text in a variety of formats.

### [Adobe Lightroom CC](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/adobe-lightroom-cc-for-ipad/id804177739?at=11l7ja&ct=tss)
Adobe Lightroom CC doesn’t seem like the typical app for extensive keyboard shortcuts, which, in truth, Lightroom doesn’t really have. Darkroom for iPad has a better array of keyboard shortcuts in my opinion. However, Lightroom’s keyboard shortcuts carry over from the Mac version in many ways, ensuring your muscle memory doesn’t have to change when you move to iOS.


**P:** When previewing an photo, this shortcut flags your photo as a “Picked” photo.

**G:** When previewing or editing a photo, this takes you back to the Grid View.

**Y:** This keystroke cycles you through a before and after of your current photo.

**Command + C, then Command + V on a new photo:** Copy and paste are prevalent across all apps on iOS, but Lightroom’s version of copy/paste allows you to copy specific edits from your current photo and paste them onto a different photo. Unfortunately, batch pasting is not yet available in Lightroom CC for iPad.

I could probably write another 2,500 words highlighting different shortcuts I use throughout iOS. One of my most-used iPad apps these days is [Spark](https://thesweetsetup.com/apps/best-ipad-email-app/), and you can do a ton inside Spark with an external keyboard. However, most of Spark’s iPad keyboard shortcuts are identical to shortcuts found in other email apps. For example: **Command + R** allows you to reply to a message, and so on.

(It still baffles me that Apple’s default keyboard shortcut to send a message in Mail.app is **Command + Shift + D**. Thank goodness Spark’s sending shortcut is **Command + Return**, like every other civilized email app on the planet.)

My phone now indicates 29% battery remaining, which is impressive considering how much I've used it today. Thus far, Day One 2 seems to be an application fit to replace my paper journaling. Yes, I would like to improve my discipline of thought and exercise my writing hand, but the rate of information archival is simply insufficient. As opposed to my use of ∆ to separate thoughts in a gigantic block of turmoiled text earlier today, I shall now begin a new note if I have changed locations and/or thoughts at all. The software's ability to convert to PDF should make revisiting it relatively intuitive. Let ∆ indicate more intention to make public/publish than usual.

Perhaps making use of the "tags" feature will hone my ability to quickly arrive at relevant tags in the future. I wouldn't be surprised if my media career would stand to befit tremendously from such refinement. Additionally, plenty of new media grunts are already writing and publishing directly from their smartphones...

# The Best iPad Keyboard Shortcuts for Improved Productivity
For those who use their iPad with an external keyboard, we’ve put together a list of more than 30 helpful iPad Keyboard Shortcuts to save you time and be more productive on your device. We’ve also included a cheat sheet of keyboard shortcuts to accompany some of our favorite iPad apps (such as Things, Ulysses, Lightroom, and more).


Despite the fact the iPad is a large glowing touchscreen, it almost feels like it was built to be used with a keyboard. In the same way the [Apple Pencil](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B07K1WWBJK/?tag=sweetsetup-20) unlocks all the iPad Pro’s drawing and annotation features, so too does an external keyboard unlock many of the iPad’s most powerful features.

An external keyboard — I’ve become an advocate for the [Smart Keyboard Folio](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B07JZYSWPY/?tag=sweetsetup-20), and I’m *very* excited for the upcoming [Brydge Keyboard](https://www.brydge.com/products/brydge-for-ipad-pro-2018) — is an absolutely essential purchase if you’re an iPad Pro owner.

Whenever I disconnect the iPad from the Smart Keyboard Folio to read a book or read the news on the couch, it takes about 30 seconds for me to wish I had an external keyboard still attached. Navigating through iOS using Spotlight, Drag & Drop, and Split View is how the large iPad Pro was made to be used, and zipping around iOS with the external keyboard is oftentimes faster than navigating around macOS with a keyboard and mouse.

I’m not an iPad keyboard wizard by any stretch (although I claim to be when it comes to Microsoft Excel on a Windows PC), so the following shortcuts may or may not strike the level of depth you’re looking for.

Nevertheless, I hope you’re able to pick up one or two new iPad keyboard shortcuts that help to cut down on your writing, navigating, or productivity time when using an iPad with an external keyboard.

We have a set of custom productivity templates that work well with the iPad app, GoodNotes. And if you want to try them out, we’ve put together a free guide that can help you.

We’ll show you…

* How to create and save custom page templates in GoodNotes.
* How to use those page templates to transform GoodNotes into your own productivity notebook (or any other type of notebook replacement).

**Command + 6:** This shortcut acts as a “Quick Export” — it brings up the sheet’s export view, allowing you to skip over having to scroll to the top and tapping on the share sheet to preview your text in a variety of formats.

### [Adobe Lightroom CC](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/adobe-lightroom-cc-for-ipad/id804177739?at=11l7ja&ct=tss)
Adobe Lightroom CC doesn’t seem like the typical app for extensive keyboard shortcuts, which, in truth, Lightroom doesn’t really have. Darkroom for iPad has a better array of keyboard shortcuts in my opinion. However, Lightroom’s keyboard shortcuts carry over from the Mac version in many ways, ensuring your muscle memory doesn’t have to change when you move to iOS.


**P:** When previewing an photo, this shortcut flags your photo as a “Picked” photo.

**G:** When previewing or editing a photo, this takes you back to the Grid View.

**Y:** This keystroke cycles you through a before and after of your current photo.

**Command + C, then Command + V on a new photo:** Copy and paste are prevalent across all apps on iOS, but Lightroom’s version of copy/paste allows you to copy specific edits from your current photo and paste them onto a different photo. Unfortunately, batch pasting is not yet available in Lightroom CC for iPad.

I could probably write another 2,500 words highlighting different shortcuts I use throughout iOS. One of my most-used iPad apps these days is [Spark](https://thesweetsetup.com/apps/best-ipad-email-app/), and you can do a ton inside Spark with an external keyboard. However, most of Spark’s iPad keyboard shortcuts are identical to shortcuts found in other email apps. For example: **Command + R** allows you to reply to a message, and so on.

(It still baffles me that Apple’s default keyboard shortcut to send a message in Mail.app is **Command + Shift + D**. Thank goodness Spark’s sending shortcut is **Command + Return**, like every other civilized email app on the planet.)

# The Best iPad Keyboard Shortcuts for Improved Productivity
For those who use their iPad with an external keyboard, we’ve put together a list of more than 30 helpful iPad Keyboard Shortcuts to save you time and be more productive on your device. We’ve also included a cheat sheet of keyboard shortcuts to accompany some of our favorite iPad apps (such as Things, Ulysses, Lightroom, and more).


Despite the fact the iPad is a large glowing touchscreen, it almost feels like it was built to be used with a keyboard. In the same way the [Apple Pencil](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B07K1WWBJK/?tag=sweetsetup-20) unlocks all the iPad Pro’s drawing and annotation features, so too does an external keyboard unlock many of the iPad’s most powerful features.

An external keyboard — I’ve become an advocate for the [Smart Keyboard Folio](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B07JZYSWPY/?tag=sweetsetup-20), and I’m *very* excited for the upcoming [Brydge Keyboard](https://www.brydge.com/products/brydge-for-ipad-pro-2018) — is an absolutely essential purchase if you’re an iPad Pro owner.

Whenever I disconnect the iPad from the Smart Keyboard Folio to read a book or read the news on the couch, it takes about 30 seconds for me to wish I had an external keyboard still attached. Navigating through iOS using Spotlight, Drag & Drop, and Split View is how the large iPad Pro was made to be used, and zipping around iOS with the external keyboard is oftentimes faster than navigating around macOS with a keyboard and mouse.

I’m not an iPad keyboard wizard by any stretch (although I claim to be when it comes to Microsoft Excel on a Windows PC), so the following shortcuts may or may not strike the level of depth you’re looking for.

Nevertheless, I hope you’re able to pick up one or two new iPad keyboard shortcuts that help to cut down on your writing, navigating, or productivity time when using an iPad with an external keyboard.

We have a set of custom productivity templates that work well with the iPad app, GoodNotes. And if you want to try them out, we’ve put together a free guide that can help you.

We’ll show you…

* How to create and save custom page templates in GoodNotes.
* How to use those page templates to transform GoodNotes into your own productivity notebook (or any other type of notebook replacement).
Plus, we also have included a couple of our custom productivity templates for you to get started with. These templates are right out of our popular productivity course.

## Standard iPad Keyboard Shortcuts Every iPad Owner Needs to Know
These keyboard shortcuts are system-wide and 100% necessary to learn like the back of your hand, except for (perhaps) the Messages keyboard shortcut. Moving between conversations using the keyboard may not strike a chord with everyone. I find this shortcut fundamental to my everyday work.

**Command + H:** Whenever you’re inside an app, this keyboard shortcut takes you to the home screen. I often use this shortcut over and over when unlocking the iPad.


**Command + Space:** This iPad Keyboard shortcut opens the system-wide search, or Spotlight. You can search for so many things inside Spotlight, but the key to this shortcut is the ability to drag and drop an icon anywhere on your iPad from within Spotlight to Slide Over or Split View.


**Command + Tab:** Like on the Mac, this shortcut navigates between your last ten used apps. I wish the list of apps was longer.

**Command + Shift + 3:** Again, like the Mac, this shortcut takes a screenshot of everything on the display. The screenshot then hovers in the bottom left corner for you to save or act on it.

**Command + Shift + 4:** Similar to the aforementioned screenshot shortcut, this shortcut also takes a screenshot of everything on the display, but then directly puts you into the editing view in order to crop or annotate the image.

**Press and hold Command:** Only available on iOS (unfortunately), this shortcut produces a window highlighting all the keyboard shortcuts within a specific app.

**Command + Up/Down Arrows inside Messages:** And my favorite shortcut of all, this shortcut moves between conversations within Messages.

## Other System-Wide, iPad Keyboard Shortcuts That I Can’t Live Without
The above five or six shortcuts are likely shortcuts you’re aware of if you have even a semi-remote knowledge of OS keyboard navigation. The following shortcuts are a little less known (I only learned them with the debut of the latest iPad Pros) and which have become fundamental to how I work on the iPad.


**Command + Option + D:** This shortcut brings up the dock, allowing to open a different app or drag an app out of your dock for Split View or Slide Over.


**Command + Shift + 4:** Like the screenshot shortcut above, this shortcut automatically takes you to the image preview rather than resting the screenshot in the bottom left of your screen for a few seconds. This shortcut saves an extra tap if you know you want to act on your screenshot right away.


**Press and hold the down arrow (bottom right corner of screen):** Sometimes, you want to use the software keyboard rather than the external keyboard (this happens to me a lot when I want to snap a screenshot with the software keyboard displayed) and you *don’t* want to undock your iPad from the external keyboard (specifically the Smart Keyboard Folio without an eject key). This shortcut brings up the software keyboard without having to undock your iPad.

**Press Shift to uncapitalize letter at beginning of a sentence:** This shortcut was a lifesaver once I discovered it. For all those times when you want to start your sentence with a lowercase letter, or if you just don’t want to capitalize something, hit the shift key before typing your word and iOS won’t autocorrect the letter to a capital letter.

## Some Text-Specific Shortcuts
If you handle text on iOS, these shortcuts are sure to save you some time — and limit the still frustrating-to-use fingertip text selections you have to make.

**Option + Shift + Left/Right:** A little more common, this shortcut selects the previous/next word in the sentence.


**Shift + Left/Right:** This is a combination of the first two shortcuts — this shortcut begins text selection on the left/right of the cursor and highlights one character at a time.

**Shift + Command + Left/Right:** To select the entire line from the left/right of the cursor, use this shortcut.

**Shift + Option + Up/Down**: To select an entire paragraph above/below the cursor, use this shortcut.

**Shift + Command + Up/Down:** And if a *Command + A* shortcut isn’t what you need, use this shortcut to select all text in the document (above or below from the cursor).

## Some Safari-Specific Shortcuts
Mobile Safari has a long way to go before it reaches the functionality level of any desktop browser, but its keyboard shortcuts aren’t too bad.

**Control + Tab:** Rather than trying to use your blunt finger to tap on the next tab, switch to the next tab using this shortcut. Note, this is *Control*, not *Command* (I forgot that a lot in the early days).

**Control + Shift + Tab:** Throw a *Shift* key in there to move to the previous tab.


**Command + F:** If you’re looking for a specific term on the webpage, this shortcut brings up the Find feature. This is one of those shortcuts so natural to an external keyboard that doesn’t translate at all when not using an external keyboard — you can only search the webpage from the share sheet, a long and convoluted workaround if you ask me.


**Command + L:** If it’s time to type in a new URL or if you’re wanting to quickly Google something, this shortcut highlights the text input/URL field.

**Command + Shift + T:** Did you accidentally close a tab too soon? This shortcut opens the last-closed tab, and you can also press it several times to continue restoring each previously closed tab.

**Command + [**: This shortcut goes back one page in your browsing history. Similar to swiping from the left to right, but without leaving the keyboard.

**Command + ]**: Same as above, but for moving forward in your browsing history.

We have a set of custom productivity templates that work well with the iPad app, GoodNotes. And if you want to try them out, we’ve put together a free guide that can help you.

We’ll show you…

* How to create and save custom page templates in GoodNotes.

## Some App-Specific, iPad Keyboard Shortcuts
These are my most-used iPad keyboard shortcuts in my most-used third-party apps. In the case of Things 3, it’d be great to see iOS *as a whole* adopt the keyboard navigational ease present within the app.

### [Things 3](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/things-3-for-ipad/id904244226?at=11l7ja&ct=tss)
Things 3 is the ultimate iPad keyboard app. This type of app is seemingly built to be navigated using a keyboard and I feel Things 3 broke new ground with this feature.


**Down arrow key then enter on a task:** Things 3 can be navigated top to bottom using the keyboard, but this simple shortcut highlights a task in whichever view you find yourself in. Once highlighted, hit Enter/Return to drop down the task’s notes and tab through the task’s other options.

**Command + 1:** This shortcut opens your Inbox. Use this shortcut, then use a **Command + N** to begin your morning brain dump.

**Command + 2:** This shortcut opens your Today view. Use this shortcut, then **press the down arrow key** to act on the task.


**Command + S:** Specifically powerful when you’re in your Inbox, this shortcut opens up the task scheduler, allowing you choose a date for when you’d like to complete the task.


**Command + Shift + M:** I use this shortcut more than any other in Things 3. This shortcut opens the task mover dialog box, allowing you to move the task to any one of your areas or projects.

**Command + K:** Finally, when you’ve completed a task, this shortcut checks it off your list.

### [Bear Notes](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/bear/id1016366447?at=11l7ja&ct=tss)
Ninety-nine percent of Bear can be navigated using the keyboard. You just need to learn how to do it.

**Command + Return:** If you’re currently editing a note, this shortcut ends editing and eliminates your cursor. From here, you can then use arrow keys to move between your lists of notes.

**Command + 1:** This shortcut brings you to your master list of notes, at which point you can use the arrow keys to move between your individual notes.


**Command + 2:** I use this shortcut quite often. I send all sorts of random stuff into Bear, and I triage or process my notes by tagging them. In essence, the “Untagged” view is like my “Inbox.” This shortcut takes me straight to my untagged notes.

**Command + Shift + F:** This shortcut is a bit different than the standard *Command + F* shortcut. This shortcut specifically searches your note list rather than the contents of a specific note.


**Command + Option + Left/Right Arrows:** When in your note view, this shortcut navigates to the next note in your list.

### [Ulysses](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ulysses/id1225571038?at=11l7ja&ct=tss)
Like Bear, a quick Google search for how to navigate inside Ulysses on iPad yielded a surprising number of helpful keyboard shortcuts.


**Command + Option + Left/Right Arrows:** This shortcut moves Ulysses left and right, taking you from the text editor to your sheet list to your groups and filters, or into your attachments bar to the right.

**Command + Option + Up/Down Arrows:** Like the shortcut above, this shortcut jumps you to the previous or next sheet in your sheet list.


**Command + Shift + K:** This shortcut automatically opens the keyword selector for your selected sheet — perfect if you like to tag your sheets inside Ulysses.


**Command + Option + T:** When inside the text editor, this keyboard shortcut brings in Typewriter Mode, keeping your current line of text in the same spot to keep you focused on your current writing.


**Command + 6:** This shortcut acts as a “Quick Export” — it brings up the sheet’s export view, allowing you to skip over having to scroll to the top and tapping on the share sheet to preview your text in a variety of formats.

### [Adobe Lightroom CC](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/adobe-lightroom-cc-for-ipad/id804177739?at=11l7ja&ct=tss)
Adobe Lightroom CC doesn’t seem like the typical app for extensive keyboard shortcuts, which, in truth, Lightroom doesn’t really have. Darkroom for iPad has a better array of keyboard shortcuts in my opinion. However, Lightroom’s keyboard shortcuts carry over from the Mac version in many ways, ensuring your muscle memory doesn’t have to change when you move to iOS.


**P:** When previewing an photo, this shortcut flags your photo as a “Picked” photo.

**G:** When previewing or editing a photo, this takes you back to the Grid View.

**Y:** This keystroke cycles you through a before and after of your current photo.

**Command + C, then Command + V on a new photo:** Copy and paste are prevalent across all apps on iOS, but Lightroom’s version of copy/paste allows you to copy specific edits from your current photo and paste them onto a different photo.

# Capturing Stereo Audio from Built-In Microphones
Configure an iOS device’s built-in microphones to add stereo recording capabilities to your app.

## Overview
Stereo audio uses two channels to create the illusion of multidirectional sound, adding greater depth and dimension to your audio and resulting in an immersive listening experience. iOS provides a number of ways to record audio from the built-in microphones, but until now it's been limited to mono audio only. Starting in iOS 14 and iPadOS 14, you can now capture stereo audio using the built-in microphones on supported devices.

Because a user can hold an iOS device in a variety of ways, you need to specify the orientation of the right and left channels in the stereo field. Set the built-in microphone’s directionality by configuring:
* Polar pattern. The system represents the individual device microphones, and beamformers that use multiple microphones, as data sources. Select the front or back data source and set its polar pattern to stereo.
* Input orientation. When recording video, set the input orientation to match the video orientation. When recording audio only, set the input orientation to match the user interface orientation. In both cases, don’t change the orientation during recording.

This sample app shows how to configure your app to record stereo audio, and helps you visualize changes to the input orientation and data-source selection.

* Note: You must run the sample on a supported physical device running iOS 14, or later. To determine whether a device supports stereo recording, query the audio session’s selected data source to see if its [supportedPolarPatterns](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation/avaudiosessiondatasourcedescription/1616450-supportedpolarpatterns) array contains the [stereo](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation/avaudiosession/polarpattern/3551726-stereo) polar pattern.

## Configure the Audio Session Category
Recording stereo audio requires the app’s audio session to use either the [record](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation/avaudiosession/category/1616451-record) or [playAndRecord](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation/avaudiosession/category/1616568-playandrecord) category. The sample uses the `playAndRecord` category so it can do both. It also passes the `defaultToSpeaker` and `allowBluetooth` options to route the audio to the speaker instead of the receiver, and to Bluetooth headphones.

```swift
func setupAudioSession() {
    do {
        let session = AVAudioSession.sharedInstance()
        try session.setCategory(.playAndRecord, options: [.defaultToSpeaker, .allowBluetooth])
        try session.setActive(true)
    } catch {
        fatalError("Failed to configure and activate session.")
    }
}
```
[View in Source](x-source-tag://SetupAudioSession)

## Select and Configure a Built-In Microphone
An iOS device’s built-in microphone input consists of an array of physical microphones and beamformers, each represented as an instance of `AVAudioSessionDataSourceDescription`. The sample app finds the built-in microphone input by querying the available inputs for the one where the port type equals the built-in microphone, and sets it as the preferred input.

```swift
private func enableBuiltInMic() {
    // Get the shared audio session.
    let session = AVAudioSession.sharedInstance()
    
    // Find the built-in microphone input.
    guard let availableInputs = session.availableInputs,
          let builtInMicInput = availableInputs.first(where: { $0.portType == .builtInMic }) else {
        print("The device must have a built-in microphone.")
        return
    }
    
    // Make the built-in microphone input the preferred input.
    do {
        try session.setPreferredInput(builtInMicInput)
    } catch {
        print("Unable to set the built-in mic as the preferred input.")
    }
}
```
[View in Source](x-source-tag://EnableBuiltInMic)

## Configure the Microphone Input’s Directionality
To configure the microphone input’s directionality, the sample sets its data source’s preferred polar pattern and the session’s input orientation. It performs this configuration in its `selectRecordingOption(_:orientation)`  method, which it calls whenever the user rotates the device or changes the recording option selection.

```swift
func selectRecordingOption(_ option: RecordingOption, orientation: Orientation, completion: (StereoLayout) -> Void) {
    
    // Get the shared audio session.
    let session = AVAudioSession.sharedInstance()
    
    // Find the built-in microphone input's data sources,
    // and select the one that matches the specified name.
    guard let preferredInput = session.preferredInput,
          let dataSources = preferredInput.dataSources,
          let newDataSource = dataSources.first(where: { $0.dataSourceName == option.dataSourceName }),
          let supportedPolarPatterns = newDataSource.supportedPolarPatterns else {
        completion(.none)
        return
    }
    
    do {
        isStereoSupported = supportedPolarPatterns.contains(.stereo)
        // If the data source supports stereo, set it as the preferred polar pattern.
        if isStereoSupported {
            // Set the preferred polar pattern to stereo.
            try newDataSource.setPreferredPolarPattern(.stereo)
        }

        // Set the preferred data source and polar pattern.
        try preferredInput.setPreferredDataSource(newDataSource)
        
        // Update the input orientation to match the current user interface orientation.
        try session.setPreferredInputOrientation(orientation.inputOrientation)

    } catch {
        fatalError("Unable to select the \(option.dataSourceName) data source.")
    }
    
    // Call the completion handler with the updated stereo layout.
    completion(StereoLayout(orientation: newDataSource.orientation!,
                            stereoOrientation: session.inputOrientation))
}
```
[View in Source](x-source-tag://SelectDataSource)

This method finds the data source with the selected name, sets its preferred polar pattern to stereo, and then sets it as the input’s preferred data source. Finally, it sets the preferred input orientation to match the device’s user interface orientation.

# iPhone 12 Pro Max (Working Draft)
Big Boy; Big Phone

## I lied.
"This *really is* my last iPhone."

This is the last sentence of [my very sentimental iPhone 8 Plus review](https://bilge.world/iphone-8-plus-review) from May, 2018, in which I bemoaned Apple's decision to finally retire the basic hardware configuration which had defined the marque's first ten years, citing my "loyalty."

In the past few weeks, I have come to realize that the device which I now hold in my hands - which I *cling to*, in fact, at all hours and completely without reason - is the absolute manifestation of everything my 14-year-old, first generation iPhone-adopting self could have possibly dreamt of in its future.

Original iPhone Activation

Unlike that iPhone 8 Plus review - which was a very sentimental reflection on "the last iPhone" designed in the configuration I had understood for a decade and therefore accompanied by a bunch of foolhardy lamentations *bitching* about the iPhone X - this review will be one of sincere wonderment regarding *the thing, itself.* Taken out of 2020 context and placed in my 14-year-old hand in 2009, this Pacific Blue iPhone 12 Pro Max would not have disappointed me in the slightest. By that, I mean... It is as unimaginably capable as I would have imagined.

The Original

These past weeks, I have indulged myself thoroughly in the company of this long-dormant *Handset Enthusiast* part of me - this dork who seems to be infinitely enchanted by conversations vaguely about innovation in a business which seemed almost inevitably alienating of anyone who didn't care enough about some unexotic discussion in the tech community to a demonstrably obsessive degree. Again, the experience has screamed over and over again that I am extremely vulnerable to high computing capability. In other words, the more a computer can do, the more I want to see what I can do *with* it. For a very long time, iPhone OS' locked downness actually helped me tremendously in this regard.

about the tools we use to make things: how we learned to make them, how we learned to learn to use them, and how we learned to teach others - identifying it *truly* and meditating

into a hypothetical future which

it is a guarantee that no matter where I may go or who I may find myself unwittingly surrounded by, the option to escape into my own Computing World *in its entirety* and more - not just an abbreviated, **Mobile** facsimile - shall from now on and forever be with me, there against my right asscheek, just a grab and a glance away. Like The Holy Spirit was it pledged and prepared to stay by my side.

down to a depth of six feetYa know, I'm actually astonished by how much of this ritual *hasn't* changed.

# Friday Night Lights
Save for golf, I have always been less interested in football than literally any other spectator sport and yet I am *so* glad I watched this film again as an adult and actually gave it my attention. What a tremendous filmmaking triumph! Surely there is no other that matches its portrayal of the gargantuan, tragic spectacle that is American football. I couldn’t help but marvel this time at the thought of just how difficult it must have been to create this movie... I don’t know anything about choreography, but reenacting those plays without making them look choreographed must have been daunting as fuck.
Most of all, though, I’m glad I actually understand the meaning behind the title of Big KRIT’s “[Boobie Miles](https://youtu.be/B9KiXVom3H0).”

I stopped.

It was unplayable.

Though I've destroyed a few consciously,
I hate them that way.
Like horses,
pianos *do not die well*.

simply asking "can you introduce yourself?" of an interviewee has somehow never occurred to me. (until today.)

what are we doing - more fundamentally -
than *making available*

I intend to help the Literary Action Corps. Imagine the recording possibilities.

I believe Brent and I have agreed on rent: $160, bi-weekly. It'll be interesting trying to sustain such things.

As my payment for extratone.com has gone through, I should plan to officially launch it in one week. I think this is a good opportunity to finally draft up the *history of Drywall* as best as possible. I'd like my official title to be **Scry**, I think.

∆

For as long as I can remember, I have been stricken with a primal need to "create" content of infinitely many sorts. In Kindergarten, I professed my love for my first crush in a "mixtape" recorded on a My First Sony. I can't imagine it possessed much musical value in the objective sense, but it was probably quite *Dry*, as we say in the movement.

*Elizabeth, hit me up if you've somehow retained the cassette. I would pay a hefty sum for it.*

In Elementary school, I spent a fair amount of time surrounding myself in a mass of cassettes and microcassettes sourced from garage sales and my mother's collegiate surplus. As **Brent** can attest, I often left a trail of them behind me whenever I traveled.

I also wrote a 60-something page novella inspired by *The Boxcar Children* in third or fourth grade, and it was quite terrible, as you'd expect.

My first videos on YouTube were awful firearm reviews as per my irreverence for Nutnfancy. (He's still the best tactical obsessive on the web.) And my brief obsession with the exploding personal technology industry spawned a terribly-named "tech review" channel that I shall spend the rest of my days trying to forget.

When I began my foray as a student pilot, I maintained a "vlog" for every lesson, including tremendously-tedious in-cockpit audio recordings. Though I've done my best to remove all traces of the product, the side-effectual experience I gained with audio and video came along with me to high-school, where its magnitude was - to my surprise - quite unusual.

Luckily, by my Junior year, I had found a group of friends that nurtured my lacking self-awareness,  gradually propelling me into a state of all-consuming embarrassment with my portfolio as it stood. This began a sort of reactionary period to the ideals I'd held in my youth, which I've just recently determined with confidence as the origin of *Drywall* as an ideological system.

I had put significant effort into everything I'd done. My tendency to obsess over revision was exploited by the capabilities of modern video editing software, particularly. Though it was always my own, there was always a standard of quality to crawl toward. All that effort, though, had gone toward work which was simply not lucrative, despite my own particular polish. Exposure - as it does - had drastically evolved my perspective, and left me with a worthless body of work spread over a plethora of identities due to my dabbling nature.

In conjunction with the daily conversations with my friends, I decided the solution was to consolidate *every* new work under one banner, which would operate entirely absent of any consideration for audience whatsoever. I knew that removing as completely as possible any filters from my "creative process" would exponentially increase my output volume, at least.

It was in those school lunch discussions that **Brent** and I discovered our mutual adoration of **clippng**, a classification of distortion unique to digital audio. All the while, I was learning the essential mechanics of electronic hardware under Jim Kyd's *Electronics I & II* courses. Though it wasn't a part of the curriculum, Mr. Kyd indulged those who would listen in little wisdoms he'd accrued throughout his various careers. I learned some finer points and foundational formulas in audio engineering, which I would put to use in our early productions.

The first was *The Tinnitus Ep*, for my friends' punk/noise band, Apathetic Cake Gluttons. It was a live recording on 5 simultaneous channels from 4 separate improvised sources. The final product could be considered impressive, I suppose, considering it is most certainly my first attempt at multitrack mixing. The band's Twitter account has survived the years, astoundingly, and still proclaims "we make music that you download."

I think the audio track for the *What the Fuck?* video got something like 80,000 listens on Brent's SoundCloud, but by most measures, the ancient web presence lies.

After that year, enough began happening in my day-to-day life that it's difficult to be definite about much. From what hard data remains intact, we can infer that the year (almost to the day) that passed between the death of the *Gluttons* and the first official Drywall release was spent honing my ability to consistently molest *Garageband 2008*, despite its restrictions as a wholly-pedestrian DAW. [Digital Audio Workstation]

That Christmas (2010,) I asked for a Samson C01-U condenser mic (a gift which has astoundingly survived 6 years of semi-regular use,) which allowed me to bypass the need for a digital audio interface by simply outputting directly to USB 2.0. Considering the breadth of environmental horrors we've subjected it to since (including *Miata Music 2*, the mixtape recorded, edited, "mastered," produced, *and* uploaded without leaving the open cloth seats of my NB MX-5,) I can proclaim it to be - without hesitation - the highest-value piece of equipment I've ever had the fortune to own.

Though I was afraid to abuse it, at first, as all the microphones I'd used were dynamic, cheap, and tolerant. But by late summer, I was willing to position it just above a treadmill to capture an integral sound to *Hamura*, the first and debatably-Dryest of my entire discography.

I recorded the first track, *The Deep Wound My Parents Left Me Because You Are Gone And I Have Too Many Won't Help Come To Me Tonight*, having yet to decide whether or not to call it Drywall or Hamura, with zero intention of monitoring each successive track as they were laid down.

I kept all of the literary anthologies I bought for community college, and have made many a useful discovery because of it (long after leaving school, of course.) The *American*'s Glück selections weren't nearly as puzzling as *The Wild Iris* has been, if memory serves, but that's not an unexpected transition, right? This is the expected collection; the first suggestion on Amazon, and now, I've presented some words for you, long after the fact. The recent arrival of my first of her printed works should not detract from my now-well-established (if a bit expectedly-sparse) fascination with this jaded and mysterious Vermont-locked savant.

What I remember of The Poetry Foundation's Louise Glück biography is rich and articulate, but I specifically avoided re-reading it for this *thing* that you are now consuming. I'm sure I've pledged I'd *never* review poetry in the past, but this particular poet (who is the precise opposite of *The New*, by the way) operates in such a unique context that I've (obviously) found the urge to spew irresistible.

*How should one format such a thing? I hope I never know.*

The format of the collection, though, is a bit mystifying. I'd bet you could find an explanation, if you searched a bit, but that's an especially silly pursuit within poetry as a medium, yeah?

Basically, I was originally quite confused by the multiple works called *Matins*, which is apparently "a service of morning prayer in various churches."

Perhaps it's a bit crude to be hung up on the contrast of the contemporary Yale-lecturing laureate who's masterfully-articulated, Pulitzer-validated compositions are mostly about being really sad and pissed at God? Within the universally-intimate boundaries of petty botany, no less?

If it is, brace for crude musings because I've just summarized most of my sentiments in two sentences.

Stair Tricks X II

If you find yourself in that age-old confrontation - to redeem Star Trek beyond the cheese for an uneducated friend - use *endearing* as your secret weapon.

I dreamt I was in a classroom. Meagan was there along with Rocky and some other people I may know. We were being taught by the president of the United States, who wasn't Obama. Crop dusting was discussed, along with other things that could only come from me.

Eating at Flat Branch after the wedding. I walked in during the vows....  It was bad. But Meagan's mom isn't mad. Her sister and crew are here too + Adam and Andy. We might move them into the Clinton house with the truck today.

I spent last night at Eryn's new house. (Which is adorable.)
We also hung out with Dan for a bit.
We had sex! I was really boring, though (which I regret,) but she seemed to enjoy it a lot? I'm glad, but surprised. She said lots of nice things like "you're bigger than I thought," which is all well and good, but damn... I need to get in shape again. Shameful. Maybe work on abs a bit?

Shinji's ability (read: his intelligence) to freestyle on-the-spot about WWII is OTHERWORLDLY. Young Rommel
*Bitch I cracked Enigma*

*The New* is gaining momentum. Every few episodes, we've hit on the sort of discussion I've been wanting to hear. Since, I've discovered Joshua Topolsky's *Tomorrow*, which has seemed to be a highly guest-focused production from the few episodes I've listened to, but in the sort of context I've been hoping to manifest, simply because its cast is definitively passionate about reexamining the purpose of web content. (Topolsky's behind *The Outline*, which - from all current accounts - is something *Extratone* readers and writers will look forward to.)

A recurring cast of hosts is something that defines the podcasts I tend to enjoy, but I've never *really* attained it in my own production to date.

My friend Shinji's participation throughout *Drycast* always guaranteed worthwhile content (for me, anyway.) Our conversations remain some of the most entertaining and intellectually stimulating that I will ever experience, I'm sure. He and I share a peculiar hobby: contrasting our knowledge of early-20th century history with contemporary culture. (Hence, "Hella Hoes in the Heinkel.") He's an incredible wordsmith, and probably the only white rapper I can listen to without any cringing whatsoever.

I've yet to articulate adequately *why* these talks are so entertaining, but hopefully better archival and publication will give you an idea. Fundamentally, it is the *contrast*, which makes a pretty great name for a podcast, yeah? If nothing else.

The endeavor itself is not by any means constrained in humor. It is a primary tool of storytelling and arguing. As far as statements of purpose, this is what I've got so far:

"A studious discussion of human communication and its relationship with spectacle, past, present, and future."

The other personality, Nina, is also an extraordinary lyricist. Her late band *Something Witty* is one of those high school musical projects you *actually* want to hear.

It's early to make any pledges in regards to the show's regularity. Quality and succinctness will always be the higher priority.

Pith's dog! A white female husky named Libel. And Lily's dog is from the same litter - a male named Slander.

Third twenty now. I should probably write a book about stimulant abuse one day and all the nuances of Adderall I've discovered through the years. After all this time, I still can't decide if my overabundant conversations in the topic are as a result of some personally supreme awareness, or... Bullshit?

Really pushing it on the sleep, but I'm guessing any residual Vyvanse in my system is carrying some of the weight.

I feel strange. I shouldn't be surprised.

every human being of word persuasion has tried to get smells down
has tried to keep them
this late-August air is of a very particular nature
to me
one that I would care to remain in forever
were it not for that most irritating reality of our special psychology: the prerequisite for sensation: Saturation and its Lack

ask anybody on the street, these days;
olfaction is the foundation of memory

the seasons - for the moment -
are relatively rigid,
thankfully
Autumn is necessary for my wellbeing
and I can always count on it arriving,
eventually

when I'm able to wear my silk-lined coat again,
I carry a stronger memory of Her hugs with me
the long, silent ones
with my face buried in her curls,
my hands as flat as possible on her back
we must've fit & trusted more than anyone I'll ever hold again
because the girls I've held since,
I haven't really held
neither of us seem to be able to summon *it*

we met in Summer 2010,
came together February 22nd, 2011,

I've responded to the fleet CTA and came with the knowledge of who to "anchor" on during a fight. I've just gotten on a few killmails, I'm sure. We engaged a Confessor fleet in YKSC-A.

We are now bumping around asteroid belts. I heard the FC ask "did the DRONE WALKERS guys make it okay?"

It would seem they've joined the war. I think there's a legitimate possibility of detriment if I were to make this public information, though.

Sensor damps kept our range low on the first engagement. According to the FC, Round 1 went to them, and Round 2 to us.

Some interesting Goon chatter in local.

Sort Dragon, our FC, is now asking for an alt to light a cyno. I like him a lot. He's brutal, but that's exactly what we need. Perhaps because he's British, I find him particularly concise in the method he uses to issue orders. Tonight has certainly gone a lot better for me than the night a bit ago where I ended up not knowing who to anchor to.

Lost my Jackdaw in the last engagement, but swiftly bought a new one from 01Y-ED, the PH hub.

At Meagan's. About to go meet Spencer Larson at the MACC parking lot. Still didn't get the nail fixed. Was driving the Miata and I realized how much I miss going on drives.

∆ A Note on Appearances: Pennames & Avatars
I understand the appeal of a certain degree of anonymity in your online communications, but I think we must all begin to acknowledge that it is futile, for the most part. This is not a declaration made out of expertise, necessarily, so please discuss. I'm genuinely curious and I think it's most assuredly a relevant conversation for content.

Ideally, we'd all be writing under our "real" names with Gravatar profile pictures synced up with our external web presence, but I'm well aware that's a lot to ask, and it's (frankly) never going to happen.

As close as possible, though, would be nice. A penname (minimum: first and last) that you'll stick to, and a profile picture that - if nothing else - does not depict another living individual besides yourself. If you MUST write under a one-word username, you can do so, but make it not shitty please. Also, kill me.

I have a feeling the profile picture thing is gonna be a goddang mess, so I'm going to look into alternatives to Gravatar/BuddyPress for that particular feature. Eliminating author pics altogether may end up being necessary, which would be a shame.

A uniform @username across Discord, Twitter, and Extratone will be soooo worth any trouble it'd take to manifest for me and everybody, really. If you can't, don't be surprised or offended if I misidentify you all the time.

If this whole thing is offensive to you, just do you. If I was paying you, I'd make it mandatory, but I'm not, so all I can do is beg. I'd rather you write great shit under @shittingcunts420 than withhold your content out of abrasion with this standard.

I have an interview at the HyVee gas station on Nifong today. Collinp asked me if I'm gay which was a little weird. I didn't keep up with STLV as much as I wanted to last night because I was tired and Miles was here.



In mom's office watching the last day of coverage from Star Trek Las Vegas and keeping an eye on Gary with Meagan while she's gone to Target.



Meagan is playing Star Trek Online with me, and that makes me very happy. Missed entry yesterday. Took books back today and got about $83 for them. I'll have to go back later to sell the MACC-specific editions.

Playing STO at home. Just figured out how to get Kuvak's skills and stuff together so that I can actually play him decently. About to go get Meagan. It's disappointing that she is just now able to hang out, she was helping her cousins do more moving stuff. Mom talked to me today and said basically "you'd better get a fucking job soon" so yeah.



At home watching Deep Space Nine with Meagan. Miles, Amy and Gabriel are here. I've got to pick up Miles from skateboarding camp tomorrow at 2:30. I've been working on getting Kuvak up in STO. I've been thinking that a lifetime subscription would be a worthwhile purchase, but it's $300. I guess I'll start saving.

I've missed a few days. Today is mom's birthday. I've been playing a lot of STO, of course. My second interview at HyVee is probably going to be today. Yesterday I mowed and weed-eated the lawn. The night of the 12th, I had a strange dream. Here's how I described it to Meagan:

"Basically, we were in a house that looked kinda like my grandfather's house. Some people I don't know we're to my right and you were to my left. The tornado siren went off, I looked at my watch and it wasn't noon so I made some comment about the possibility of them testing late or something. Then, the noise of jets came and got really loud. There was a brief image of a plane's wing as it went by the window and then everything started turning white. I turned to you and hugged you and said "I love you" over and over again as I got hotter and felt myself disintegrating. I believed everything was real too it was kinda scary but not as scary as you'd think because I knew I had to hug you and tell you I love you and that's all. My last thought was that I was happy we were together."

Got back from orientation at HyVee a while ago. With Meagan now, waiting for STO to patch. Met the store director and everything. I think his name was Matt. Paula is the HR person that drug tested me (yesterday,) and the person that talked us through everything. It took about three hours. I'm wondering how I can upload the store's philosophy of slavery to the customer above the consideration of the product without being on crazy amounts of Adderall constantly. I asked for 20 hours a week and set my maximum at 35. I reaaally hope I don't get much more than 20. I'm going in tomorrow at 8AM to start training + get my shirt and everything. I'll need to buy more khaki pants.

Hello,
I'm David Blue, Editor-in-Chief of extratone dot com, and I am supremely thrilled to introduce you to a new podcast from *Studio Eat* about human communication - past, present and future.

It's called *Contrast*, which is nice, right? Almost clever.

I've come to understand that what I find funny is rooted in two primary narrative circumstances: **contrast** and **spectacle**.

I think we'll start with some definitions:

**Contrast** - "the state of being strikingly different from something else, typically something in juxtaposition or close association."

**Spectacle** - "a visually striking performance or display."

We intend to continually realize our fascination with the relationship between them in a palette of discussion and more scripted recitation.

However, our new show is by no means a primarily-amusing podcast.

You've heard this before: narratives from a personal perspective are almost always more effective than those told from the back row. I've been content back there, looking and yelling at the ceiling like a senile cat. Nice wide strokes.

It's very freeing, and it *does* lend to the sort of podcasting I've been doing. But at this point, I'm much more interested in the challenge of the moulding.

So. Let's get specific. Notice how good podcasts are often defined by a persisting set of iconic characters? We've done our best to make it happen, and haven't been entirely unsuccessful.

There's my friend **Shinji** - the world's least cringy white rapper and world war two enthusiast.

And **Nina**, Culture Columnist at Extratone and vaporwave goddesss.

Both are far superior storytellers to the third host.  Me.

But let's not forget! You're included!

If you've got a good story or some original music to share with us, send it to horn@extratone.com or visit extratone.com/submission.

Our current target episode length is 30 to 60 minutes in 192kbps stereo mp3.

We're very excited to have Noah B's music available to define our sound! You can listen on your own by visiting this is noah b dot bandcamp dot com or look for his tracks hyperlinked by order of appearance in every episode's show notes.

*Contrast* is a challenge to my own creativity's lack of design. I'm very much looking forward to freshening up *Studio Eat* with some quality narrative.

Look for episode one in the coming weeks.

For better or worse,
you'll hear from us again.

Echoes o'er the gates.

In this war, no words are true enough to allow to pass our skulls.

I reckon myself more than strong enough to delve confidently into the enemy's public correspondence without fear of their propaganda.
*Here lies one of the advantages of my fleeting relationship with duty.*
We swear ourselves to mantras, as they do. But I swear - seen but shallowly, we swear to the same creed of understanding.

From the mouth of The Mittani comes, occasionally, wisdom I would not expect. But like all maneuvers in the loud heat of warfare, small gestures must overcome the noise.

We should not endeavor to be empires, I don't think. I do not believe the form to be as lucrative as others. We are supposed to make The New, here, but - though some of us have lifetimes in our minds - our society stumbles into primal error after primal error.

But I am thankful to fight - as I was bred to - for a way of life that suits me so.

When our foe fleets require their few opportune coagulances, I like to sit above one of the barren iceworlds and listen through the transceivers to its frigid chorus.

Salute me across the way and serve the game like a good soldier. Give the people below something to charm attention to this, that they will never affect. Be a spectator sport and nullify your own ideologies.

Scouts in a slipping tandem on the water and let's not go in today.

It's just that we tend less to speak on our stirrings in these things, or anything.

I hope I don't smell.

I think I've consumed 6 or 7 20mg Adderall pills since the last time I slept, but I suppose I was particularly keen to indulge after having been so stagnant for the past week.

I left $160 in cash on the kitchen table for Brent. This may be doable if I can move everything out of the storage unit and into "my" room.

It's been 9 days since I last showered, I think, which is probably coming close to a personal record. I am pondering whether or not I should ask to shower at Mom's, as I told her I would visit today.

I attended the alliance *Q & A* hosted by Parthannun (who just followed @Jipthael on Twitter from @parthannun2) but turned it into a "let's listen to me ramble on" very shortly after today's severance-related drama was briefly discussed. I gained the title "Howling Monkey" thanks to Joshee, and learned that she lives near Cambridge, is originally from Poland, but has an American husband.

I wasn't supposed to record the session, but I did with OBS. If I remember, it will be found on the external under the videos/Eve Online folder.

The ~10 minute-long video of this morning's Astrahus kill is rendering now. I shall do my best to remember to upload it while I am at mom's.

Success found in my first attempt to sever the Drynet's folder permissions from Wordpress-exclusive internal consumption. I think it was /wp-content/uploads, legitimately.

∆

Definitely tired now. I can't tell you when I last went to sleep, but I *can* tell you it's been 13.5 hours since I went on break yesterday. There's a coalition CTA at 1900. (Really need to rig up an easily-accessible GMT-set chronograph.) I suppose it was the worst time to spend two hours listening to The Mittani's content. The Mittani for *The Mittani*, that is. It's probably fairly obvious by now, if I haven't explicitly stated it already, that *Eve* is one of my many repeated attempts at distracting myself from the Meagan reality. This is the trade I must(??) accept? Meagan for The Mittani...

Dystopia.

Brent's house reminds me of hers, I think. I suppose that sounds ridiculous, but their neighborhoods are of similar age. I talked to my camera about Meagan for awhile this morning. My best memories of all time are all tied up in that girl - I can't let them go.

∆

Brent specifically Tweeted his aversion to social contact yesterday, so I didn't say anything to him when I got home. I'm beginning to wonder if my current state is already affecting him. I guess I should try to minimize the amount of grief I post - even on my private account. Adderall does a good job of staying the bleakness, in particular. It's one of my least-favorite feelings - and I'm certain the preference originated from childhood.

Still, I think I've done extremely well keeping up appearances, considering that I am essentially just a ruin of David Blue.

The Methodical Alliance's news service now exists. I have corresponded with Targramarr about contributing, and he seemed excited. As much as I would like to aesthetically "polish" the web presence, I shall wait until my name has been established before I do so.

The past few days have certainly been eventful. I moved Extratone into its domain, finally, and have begun the process of updating the appropriate links in all my innumerable social media presences.

I'm sure my mind actually enjoys the intricacies of web management, but the reality, I think, is a reduction in my creative output, overall. It is necessary, though. I know now that I would never be satisfied by delegating the task to anyone else.

I have also made virtually zero progress on *Drywall's Written History*, but I'm technically only halfway through the week-long period I gave myself to cough it up.

In *Eve*, I experienced my first *real* big fleet fight in Saranen. I use such language because the time-dialaton system was triggered to bring the passage of game time down to 10%, which is so ridiculously tedious that I was able (or, required, I suppose) to take an AFK smoke break *during* the fight. We were all anchored on Rocky Aivoras, burning away from the mostly-Megathron BS fleet the Goons deployed.

Also of note: this was my first time undocking the coalition doctrine Cerberus fit, which I named *Michmethah, the Gift of a Striker*.

Astonishingly, our fleet didn't lose a *single* vessel in Saranen, and our coalition only lost ~25 billion ISK as opposed to The Imperium's 100 billion.

I am now protecting a Pandemic Horde entosiser - we are an escort, of sorts. They're not in the same fleet though, which is a bit inconvenient.

I tend to love this sort of role, though. Defending each other makes me feel like I'm fulfilling duties, I suppose.

Apparently, "Sword Fleet" is the doctrine fleets we've been fending off.

**From Reddit:**
*Hyperspatial rigged combat ceptors. The idea is to fly around at 12AU/s ganking undefended entosis ships. It's a solid counter to Horde's "swarm of dozens of unfit entosis slashers" attacks, and can work well against undefended entosis ships even if they have a defense fleet one jump out on a different node. Can also be taken out roaming/ratter-hunting through hostile space. DPS issues are mitigated by having 50+ dudes.
Obviously it goes down like moths to a flamethrower if it runs into a real fleet.*

I don't precisely know how the entosising mechanics work, but I do know the module (and that it consumes stront,) and that enough use of such a module on any type of "node" will eventually "finish" it - which destroys it, in effect.  And if you do enough, something gets captured?

Oh well. This is not knowledge I require, yet, and probably will not...ever.

I am continually surprised by the competence, diversity and intelligence of the people I've met in *Eve*. I almost always enjoy talking in comms, or just listening, even. In my participating in an entosiser's escort, I am contributing to the capture of a system on the frontlines of what is currently the largest war in the game.

I think it's adorable that we all "salute" each other with o7.  My squad is using the *Extratone* public correspondence channel to stay in-touch with each other since apparently the game does not offer a squad channel option.

I have no idea how inter-communication with PH is being handled, but it must be a pain in the ass considering that I haven't seen them in the Darkness comms at all. I'm now having a beer, as I have consumed the three Adderall tablets I had left, in hopes of being able to have my script refilled tomorrow before work.

I suppose I've missed out on a few lore opportunities - and should not
forget my collaboration with Shigeo Kurumaya.

I'm not sure how fleet participation is being tracked, but I certainly hope my actions tonight will place me in a better light with TMA Directors.

**TO DO**
∆ Draft some sort of introduction to *Extratone*, and hope to God it isn't lost out of lack of payment between now and Friday.

A response fleet to the Goons' now-anchoring Citadel is scheduled to begin in 30 minutes, I believe. I'm not sure I'll be able to fit up something that would actually contribute to the destruction of the structure itself, but I may arrive in *Haruphite* in case some fast fleets are needed to herd stragglers/would-be escapees.

Still awake. I suppose I probably overdid it a bit. Went to Mom's - she freaked out a lot and refused to lend me money (not that I pushed, of course,) which I'd somehow grown unaccustomed to already, as I had the sheer brightness of the house.

I explained to her again my current understanding of Meagan's influence on my emotional state, but it was probably a waste of time. She claimed that $320/month is some crazy amount for rent.

I probably Tweeted a bit *too* much Mariah adoration tonight. (She tends to occupy more and more of my mind as I get more and more tired.)
Graciously, though, she responded with a kiss emoji, which I swear I could feel on my cheek in my exhausted delusions. Assuming my IFFTT script is still working correctly, her particular self-positive Tweets that triggered my mooching will be archived by Evernote.

It's petty, but I happened upon the **Golden Age Simulations** Facebook page in the AOPA member thread, and liked the page. It's strange to find them still pursuing projects, despite the fact that Microsoft hasn't even had a flight simulator *team* in nearly 10 years, if I am informed correctly.

I also did my best to explain yesterday morning's diplomatic incident and my participation in The Northern Revolt to mom, which was humorous.

They have been pushed back into nothing. They hold space but can't expect to remain. We have been overwhelmingly victorious in every encounter we can remember, at this point.

A Call to Action comes from Deklein in the night - we now steal through the border of the combat zone in dear swift *Maale-akrabbm* as *Haruphite* is prepped in the coalition's citadel for my arrival. This is the anticipation of perhaps a real challenge. Should I want them to be more deadly?

I cannot bear such pitiful slaughter anymore.

And, they've just stood us down. Intel reported a critical bomber threat - we are not equipped to fight them.

banglord is our Fleet Commander this morning.

There are 48 of us as we undock from the Citadel in one great, gorgeous mass.

"Everyone wave in local." banglord is alright with me.

Just think about how many chat logs I'll have.

"Just to change things up guys, warp yourselves to the outgate." - what an intelligent way to keep us awake.

And now we're having a race (aligned to the out gate) to let others catch up! I definitely need to meetup with these guys someday.

Back and forth... Deklein to Branch and back over and over again.

The Goons are no longer on the map anymore... Everyone I bring it up with insists that "they'll be back." What if The Mittani decides to retire to a club life?



I am now on my way back to the citadel. I made it one jump out of RO.

I'm wondering if I should just stay at the Citadel... We just live too far away for me to ever respond quickly to pings.

Today, we are finally going through what was in the garage. Though I revisited it when I put everything in storage, it's still astonishing to find the first CD copy of the first record I ever produced.





*All of this may one day be worth significantly more revision and/or visibility in the future, but for now, just know that I rambled out all of this because it’s by far my most effective way to think, and this darned lowkey blog post has just provided a very long-overdue opportunity for it. Please feel free to read or even respond to it, if you’d like, but I’d like to ask that you don’t panic or circulate it. Thanks.*

> So far… the only intercorrespondence between staff at Inmunis is people having a problem with one another.  
> Before Extratone, there was Inmunis﻿ – my first, relatively short-lived attempt to launch an online magazine which wasn’t particularly important, but the experience surely did contribute to and inform my progression in understanding media that led to my (utter bewildered) current state. Anyhow, it’s fun to look back. Here’s the web archive’s last snapshot.  


This, a derelict Twitter account, and two film reviews by James Wilson are all that’s left of inmunis.co.uk for good reasons – many of which I did not entirely shed when I tried again. Until I started Extratone and made doing “this” – incessantly reading/exploring the web, obsessively tinkering and experimenting with The Extranet – I actually had very little knowledge on or exposure to the state of digital publishing or the real depth of variety to be found with any significant effort to comprehend the current offering real, surviving magazines, online or not, yet was dumb and arrogant enough to assume that I’d seen it all and none of it was even close to good enough for me to read or seek to write for. I was actually delusional enough to regard myself as too smart and one-of-a-kind to lower myself by going back to journalism school – that I was so special, anything I put effort in creating was destined to turn out superb. Granted, I’d had the actual idea for less than two weeks before I experienced by far the most traumatic, soul-destroying, world-upturning, and life-altering event of my entire existence, which I think accounts for the insanity, and all of my decisions were inevitably preempted by the fact that I was a 21-year-old straight white male community college dropout, which accounts for (but does not excuse) their absurdity.

I’ve publicly implied before that it was probably only thanks to Drycast – which was also in its infancy during the time of The Big Event (episode 7 was published just two days before) – and its weekly obligation to sit down and talk with my favorite people about interesting stuff that I did not end up dead or institutionalized in 2015 (I wish I was exaggerating.) If there is a Gourd, let it be known that he is fully up-to-date and brand-activated – he sent me a fucking podcast to save my life.

Reading and compiling stories for the show notes throughout the week provided an early avenue for exploring and embedding myself into media. Beyond the actual content, even, it’s been the rationality in the tone which journalists generally adhere to that has drawn me in and provided a brighter and brighter guiding light to help keep my sanity in check after my world ended because New Media values empathy in tandem with critical thought. All my life, it’s been very important to me that I continue to learn the best way to both appear and feel smart and functional. I’ve long since accepted that I am very fucking weird – and not in the wow, I dye my hair bright red sort of way which helps people feel unique, but in the holy shit, I’m terrified of what would actually result in losing control of my facade sort, which is actually much less sinister than it sounds for you, and infinitely moreso for me.

This is why I still have a very infantile habit of becoming overwhelmingly frustrated with those who socially emphasize and celebrate their “weirdness” as an important part of their identity because my self-perception has long since transitioned from regarding my deviations as something that made me “unique,” to gigantic obstacles in the way of every possible aspiration which I’ll probably never overcome, but am doomed to kill myself trying. I’m now working on learning to appreciate those very fucking common people who are determined to prove how strange they are because ultimately, my own self-perception is just as ignorant, loneliness is not a virtue, and I’ve only maintained the whole charade because I’d rather have delusions of grandeur than acknowledge that I am also mostly unoriginal, and most of my truly more “original” behaviors could easily be described as simply unhealthy.

This is an important confession for this explanation because its “solution” is another crucial motivation behind my creation of Extratone – as both a symbolic and literal means of understanding and minimizing my own biases and bitterness by 1) surrounding myself with the huge amount young, talented people I knew with great ideas and 2) editorially committing to curiosity as the most precious ideal in writing (and in life.)

I do know that – for whatever reason – I really do have a special knack for identifying the culture and creators that are truly fresh, innovative, even cool among those who can’t comprehend or stand it and the heartbreaking number of those who actualize themselves by trying to act aggressively apathetic toward the status quo. This sense is far from 100% reliable and is certainly not of a greater quality than everyone on Earth, but I would still confidently suggest it’s at least better than most, and – as most of us know – it especially jives with and defines the world of magazines.

As I did in Spring 2016, I still believe that Extratone is the best way for me to hone my greatest talents and shed my biggest problems – that it is the name I can place on my endless journey to improve myself, which – most importantly of all – will all the while achieve the tightest possible adhesion to the only meaning of “original” with any significance or real world value at all, which serves human curiosity without punishing it in any sense. I could actually just be crazy or completely, irrationally inverted – and I know it sounds abstract and preposterous – but I promise it’s my best shot at one day performing my optimal function for the world.

The very first thing I did after I’d arrived upon these hypotheses and been abruptly forced to cling to them as my last hope in life was to obsessively search for a single mantra/battlecry I could drill into my memory and could shout under duress – including the temptation to escape the whole lot of it – to succinctly remind myself that I had at least one logical chance at a fulfilling life (and yes, it’s still funny that the chance is, in fact, a Web Site.)

Scribam quid non legerim is possibly grammatically incorrect to a scholar, but it’s the best possible translation I came up with in my Latin research of “I will write what I have not read.” It’s cheesy, yes, and a bit cringey in the middle of just any old day when it happens to catch my eye where it’s proudly displayed, all-caps, in the footer of our CMS, and – I’ll be honest – I don’t know if I could explain it over coffee to a stranger without turning red and covering my face, as I once could, but it’s (sincerely, in this one ﻿case) real gravestone material. (As in, if someone were to read this after my death, they would be encouraged to receive it as a bonafide last wish.)

After avoiding the absorption of any information about Moby Dick for my whole adult life, I was just yesterday exposed by the Chuck Klosterman book I picked up from the library to the truth

Tim is here. Cecilia Davis called him out of nowhere, essentially, and I got some *Extratone* promotion in, which is hilarious.

I've been writing a lot of poetry and not playing Eve. Brent bought me pizza - I smoked my last cigarette. I hope to be able to find my $7 tax return check tomorrow so that I can get another one.









In class. I was a few minutes late.

A nail has punctured the left rear tire of the Miata. I'm hoping I can get it patched at Big O.

I'm just wondering how I'm going to afford it.



I need to shave. Nicole is coming today at some time. Both her and Aunt Nancy are leaving on Sunday. I think it's been awhile since I've done a note...possibly missed a day. I've gone through two rolls of toilet paper in two days because of potty issues. I think it was Wednesday that I submitted an application to HyVee...applying for a part time position at the gas station. Been playing A LOT of STO. I really want a lifetime subscription but I'm sure that won't happen anytime soon given that it's $300.

It is time for my friend to go. My friend and sometimes home. Friend, home, flypaper that has stuck nothing but artifacts of a society that has long since abandoned me. But here I am... crying. Really having to hold it in and any minute now I must sell a damned car. A truck.

Gary made something truly unique. He put his mind to it, too. How many gifts of such a caliber have I *really* gotten in my life? Or - perhaps a more pungent thought - how few (if any) should I *expect* to get?

And now, here they come across the bridge. Probably uniquely pleasant to me but this is my thing. This is my funeral.

So let's remember what I've learned.

I remember the day I discovered Route K and - shortly thereafter - the realization that I have always been calmed by the wordlessness of the driving process. Like when I can make myself alone with a piano - the rest is evermore significant to living.

Any minute now, I'm probably going to sell the first vehicle I had sex in - that's something I learned. The second home, really, so it should mean little, right? I can't honestly say that it holds much of Meagan for me anymore - thank the Sun. (I think that was *actually* wholehearted.)

And it was to *Danger* that I drove Meagan and Britta to the big tree after school - as often as possible - and we thought we could hear the stars through the speakers. And talked to Kailin - perhaps giving her what she needed to ruin that me. Fair and square, though.

But before all of that, it was my passage to the sky! Lessons over the early morning bluffs in a Cessna that'd been around for a half century. Austin and a radio scanner would come with me to Columbia Regional - that stagnant aviation oasis which embodies the state of the *Spirit* more than I'd want anyone to know.

I won't be able to say for certain for some time to come, but this could be my leaving home. It is not out of the question - I may feel significantly more alone. But - these days - I do not always dismiss what conventional wisdom says. I will continue driving on.



At home watching a 2013 episode of Top Gear. Today was a full 7 hour day at work. It wasn't as bad as I thought it was going to be. Tomorrow is my first day of classes. I'm pretty sure Nathan Riggs hates me because he thinks I'm a libertarian. Meagan and I spent most of the night playing Star Trek online. Yesterday, we took Jay to the vet and found out that she might have cancer.... Which sucks.

Spent all day taking care of Gary/getting his car from Dents Unlimited. He's in pretty bad shape. It was difficult just trying to stay awake. And on that note, I'm playing Star Trek Online and listening to Trek Radio at the moment. DJ Hick (the guy I used to listen to when STO was just in beta) has gotten his show back. I really wish I could've been more involved in Trek Radio. I'm sure they don't remember my name, and I wish they did. It's a pretty cool organization. They took the Enterprise-D bridge to Star Trek Las Vegas this year (I think the coverage starts at the end of this week.) I wish I could've been a part of that. They're going to be broadcasting live from it.

I was also thinking about the discrepancies between the image of how people should be that the night portrays and the reality of what it's occupants actually are.

# ablaze, the fraternal fallow
and in those open spaces,
you would fly your flag of adoration, frustration, miscommunication, and mutilation

slicing proud,
there -
lashed to the stern of the vessel *Hateful*;

her keel lain by callouses of home -
hands & feet stiff
(long ago,
they hauled barley, by bushel
down a gravel road)

but an instant of that rarified quiet stays the haze's obfuscation,
faltered:
our sisters lie lynched on dire alters

our homesteads,
crypts; shrines to delirium
the chords of our songs left unresolved
in imposters' inrequiem

plastic for stone;
fiberglass for coal
stale rot for flesh,
cut with nothing
to our bones

mirages in the mirror,
darkly:
devil's imps roost on red Remingtons,
limp

plugged,
our ears in mute

terror's gluttony,
stripped down furrows of
falsity's fatherly fugue
## truth: our souls seethe in the dark
we are drowning in our own deceptions

in excess,
we are barren
we parade nothing but the lies
which proceed the whole of Earthly pain

breathless,
we are foolish monstrosities -
the incongruent Lords of amplified insanity

resolute,
we are the hearthen hole into which all eventually fall,
famished for youth

manic,
we are the monopolized manufacturers of mantra;
an ambient, discordant dirge

patriotic,
we produce only pervading paternal plague

nostalgic,
we are the fundamental erosion of human wellness

abrasive,
we are needlessly suffering -
the listless harlequin of a nation

### the world is growing weary of our emergency
and the humongous expenditure of its petty insincerities

Brent and I watched *Smart House* for the first time in over 10 years, for myself. Strangely enough, it was actually directed by LeVar Burton. I remembered that it was the only Disney movie I ever found legitimately disturbing, but not that it was actually in *pity* of the AI, not fear. She is the real tortured party in the film, and we don't see any resolution of her captivity, either. Immediately before the film ends, Nick (hardcore simpleton default Dad) remarks that we leave them with a Pat who is "serving, but not interfering." Make no mistake - his is referring to real slavery.

At home with Meagan watching Psych and playing Pocket Planes. Should be working on Math. There's a puncture in the Miata's left rear tire (nail.) I'm going to get it fixed tomorrow. It should be $16-17 at Big O. I turned in my application to CASR today. I think it was the manager that took it from me. I was able to tell her that I knew Andy. Wrote one of my favorite poems that I've ever written today. It's titled by the date.

∆ **Facebook Exceeding Limits of Usability**

Wow. Opinion on a social media service this early in the game?

Yeah.

I have used a lot of online services for a very long time, ok? Instead of maintaining friendships in sixth grade, I was beta testing Skype. I've been using iOS since 2008. (Imagine being regularly asked "what is that?" of the iPhone in your hand. A different time, I think.) This is one of many things that I repeat often to people who don't particularly care, but I do genuinely believe it is remarkable enough to warrant a more detailed exploration in another URL in the future.

Probably the one service I've checked every day consistently for as long as I've been around is Twitter, which recently announced "oh shit" status in regards to its lack of growth and unhappy investors.

I can tell you, though, that for someone like me, it is nearly faultless, which is incredibly rare. I cannot fathom the intuitive obstacles which longtime Facebook users claim to face when they give it a go, as it is (and always has been) ridiculously simple in comparison. Such extensive use on my part makes my bias, though, as its systems have likely been ingrained into my psyche more deeply than very little else, familial or otherwise.

I'll make a solid claim for an extraordinary ability to quickly learn and understand UI as a result of so much software use throughout my youth. As I observed Facebook for iOS' Version 56.0 in my available updates list today, reflected upon my attempts to deliver *Extratone*'s Facebook Page, and remembered a friend's recent comment on Facebook Live's newly-attained superiority over Periscope, I felt compelled to finally address (read: complain about) this Mammoth Net Menace.

Without stats on use, lets assume that the vast majority of Facebook accounts are dormant - everybody's either dead, or using the service as a sort of address book for old friends and acquaintances. I think this is its most reasonable and unique function by far, and it obviously  warrants millions to keep an account.

Assuming the majority of the millions are mostly ignorant regarding their smartphone's data/resource usage, just imagine how much heat is being created by totally irrelevant background processes. Imagine the potential *drag* on our infrastructure Facebook could be responsible for.

Unlike sane app developers, Facebook's codemonkeys are required to come up with a new release *every week*. I can't even begin to impart the scale of the consequences of such misincentive.

Meagan's first day of classes.

At her house now, waiting to eat with her cousins. I've been playing Star Trek Online and dreading having to work tomorrow.

At Mike's. The last day here. Tired as hell. Algebra final went badly. Moving more stuff with Adam tomorrow.

assumption: less and less of our daily lives can be forgotten (or, it's less inevitable.)
What is lost from this truth is discussed often. (Privacy/intimacy,) but the more important question is *what is gained?*

Assuming that the archival of virtually everything one does (but not thinks ((quite yet))) will be easily-accessible within my lifetime, what will it *really* change about the perspective from which we reflect upon our lives?

Here is the bargain,
surfacing again,
true
It's not that I forgot what comes with you
I simply couldn't have

My feet are getting wet and I am very much in notice
isn't that chastisable? I find it amusing.

Doing homework/studying for tomorrow's chapter 3 algebra test and listening to Keith Jarrett's Vienna Concert. It's been a long time since I've listened to it.

Also got a Nasenbluten tape (digital file) today and listened to some Stunt Rock stuff. He seems really like-minded, especially given his track titles and use of clipping/intentionally distorted stuff.

Roobie Phawl's first official show is at Fay St. today.

If I don't get a good grade on this test, there's a good chance I'll fail the class.

Meagan is sleeping behind me. She is beautiful.

At Mike's again tonight. We may or may not be driving to the Kansas City airport tomorrow to deliver the spare keys to Lisa's car (Mike lost them during their honeymoon in Santa Fe.) Meagan's sleeping. I'm probably going to be unable to sleep much due to all the caffeine I had recently. I really hope the Miata will be able to make the drive. They're going to pay me back for gas. Gotta check my bank account, thinking about it.

Ate enough food at Arby's to sustain me for a day and a half, I'm sure, and it was only ~$8. Went downtown with the intention of parking in Lakota to write again, but Spencer Larson was outside Kaldi's and he called+beckoned. He's changed a bit - must less evangelistic, but still just as socially anxious. I told him that I really have no idea where I'm going, and am reluctant to think about it until I've made some resolution with the Meagan thing. I suppose I hadn't quite defined that so explicitly internally until that moment.

Depending on what's left over after rent and settling storage debt once again, I think I should continue ratting in 1G to see just how much I can grind up. Skill injecting my way through the 20d-long Advanced Spaceship Command V is probably not within my financial means, but perhaps I can at least knock half of it off.

The *Jipthael* now sits in my ship hanger, ready to be crewed and painted. (I must remember to get a plethora of screenshots before *and* after the skin's application.)

I need to decide if I'll be building the dread or buying it. (Building it makes more sense since I have the BPC & plenty of the materials.)

@Ashterothi followed me back on Twitter, which is pretty cool. @Jipthael is a study in the benefits of narrowing your subject matter on an account.

I need to remember to **apply for SRP** for at least one of my Jackdaw losses.

I think it would be cool to attempt an in-character piece detailing the experience of operating under Sort Dragon.



At the natty pad before the first Roobie Phawls show. Technically it starts in 15 minutes but Brent wanted to practice more stuff. Meagan is here with me. Jacob and Aman are here.

* Investing Fickly

On the evening of February 22nd, 1950, under the notoriously-treacherous skies in which Charles Lindbergh co-originated the short-lived United States Airmail service thirty years prior, a ten pound, three ounce baby boy was born to Ernst and Marie Hohenburg, who very shortly afterword determined him to be the last of their then-five. By supper time, he was John Lin, because the Hohenburgs were very done with the process in general, and plum out of names.

I never got around to filming an episode of *Honk* on the truck, so that's what I'm doing.

We used to listen to Danger and drive rt. K quickly. The golden necklace thing that Britta gave me is still hung around the base of the tachometer.



Trendy/stylish intro to an update of this app.

Sitting in the basement making stupid vines and watching House of Cards. I should be working on all the algebra homework I have + trying to rescue my grade but I won't, of course.

Meagan and I fought because I had a sip of Moscato, but we're ok now.

I love her a lot.

Fleet and the Furious: Drakesville Drift notes still need to be transcribed. I need a secretary.

At home in mom's office so that she could go pick up pills for Gary. Apparently he's getting worse.... Mom says he hasn't eaten in weeks, but I think that's an exaggeration. First day of class for Western Civilization II, Public Speaking, and Geology was today. They were all pretty bad.... I'm not going to be able to use my phone in class, which sucks. At least it seems like they're all going to enforce it. And they're all male... Which is odd. The girl that works at Slackers is in my Public Speaking class and her name is Eva. Brock from Good Shepherd is also in it.

Mom came up to me today and told me Gary has refused to drink water or eat for 2 days now.... So he doesn't have much time left. I picked Meagan up in his car today to charge the battery. It was weird to realize that he went from being able to drive himself to dying in less time than it took to discharge the battery in his car. Meagan and I played Star Trek Online most of the night. The story is getting better. Tomorrow I'm going to class in the morning and then working from 3PM to 11:15PM.... Which is going to suck. I hope I'm able to make it through it. Also got the textbook for comp for free online as an eBook.

I was on that quiet seat sometimes ridden
sometimes marching and hiding
under the lights and Ember gradients
and I had playing a tireless anthem

*I'm grabbin grain
in the turnin lane
and I gotta maintain*

and it's slowed because I must keep going
wearily must keep breathing and knowing
that I pursue a singular something
that I made
and that I am climbing a mountain

*I've tried to leave the game
I know I need to change
meet me on Fondren & Main*

All at once
my slowed elders
remind me of the consequences of what I am doing
the beautiful consequences of what I have chosen

Blue hues on everything
returning
the end of the street
which North, exactly?
*all good things*

cold-cursed
to be bold,
first

every time shining

Fargo, you mystery!

raining down freckled Angels on me

Maybe my heart goes North
Maybe that is where I should be



At the fair with Meagan, Corey, and Britta. Lol America. I took an Adderall right before I came, but I'm still tired/quiet as fuck. I wonder if it's because there's so little mental stimuli.
There's a youth motocross race going on and I came up with plenty of good jokes about being at Laguna Seca for the MotoGP. (It's going on at the moment.)

Had another shoe-jet dream. This time, they had a sort of autopilot and voice control as if they were built for long distance flying. I remember leaving the house and night and admiring the beauty in the sky. I encountered a man with a new 991 911 and he let me drive it around the access road (I'm presuming the I-70 access road.) He was very nice. The car had a PDK but the interior was off from what it actually looks like. Earlier I was in some sort of hotel room. Morgan was there and we actually acknowledged each others existence.

# iPhone 12 Pro Max
Precisely 4750 days ago (give or take a few hours,) my First Generation iPhone was activated on an exceptionally cold Saturday – January 19th, 2008, just eight days before my fourteenth birthday. Obviously, it would be ridiculous for me to try and conjure up any realistic image of my day-to-day thoughts back then, but I remember watching [Steve Jobs’ original introduction of The Apple Phone](https://youtu.be/e7EfxMOElBE) at MacWorld 2007 one year prior and how *of the future* it seemed - more than any other consumer technology product I’d ever seen.

# Ava (2020)
please do not interpret the following as condescension, because it’s mostly observations about myself I thought somebody might find useful...
*Ava* is not a good film by any standard of measure, but I found it a worthwhile investment of my time. I noticed many of the reviews here criticized it for its lack of innovation, which is absolutely apt. *however*, I have personally come to realize lately that it’s important to allow myself to enjoy things even if they don’t have some quantifiable value. it was difficult not to turn off this film at a few points, but I’m glad I didn’t. there is real substance.

# iSH Wiki
The packages in Alpine Linux repositories are more updated the iSH's own repositories and have packages whose size > 512 MB as well. To use it to replace iSH's own repositories, run:

```sh
grep -v "file:///ish/apk/" /etc/apk/repositories | dd of=/etc/apk/repositories bs=4194304
echo https://dl-cdn.alpinelinux.org/alpine/v3.12/main >> /etc/apk/repositories
echo https://dl-cdn.alpinelinux.org/alpine/v3.12/community >> /etc/apk/repositories
```

Note : The reason why iSH has it's own repositories is so that the app is entirely self-contained so that iSH with `apk` can pass app review. The repositories is a pseudo `apk` filesystem mounted on /ish/apk that when read, will actually download from App Store as on-demand resources. It also means that Apple can review all packages in iSH's repositories.

iSH 1.1 includes the [APK package manager](https://wiki.alpinelinux.org/wiki/Alpine_Linux_package_management). To keep the app self contained while also not including gigabytes of packages, files are downloaded from the App Store as [on-demand resources](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/FileManagement/Conceptual/On_Demand_Resources_Guide).

If you updated from a previous version, you won't have the iSH-provided APK, since enabling it is a potentially destructive action (overwriting /etc/apk/repositories). To enable it manually, run this command after installing the 1.1 update:

```
mkdir -p /ish/apk && printf 'file:///ish/apk/main\nfile:///ish/apk/community\n' > /etc/apk/repositories && mount -t apk apk /ish/apk && tar -xf /ish/apk/main/x86/apk-tools-static-2.10.5-r1.apk -C / && apk.static add apk-tools && rm /sbin/apk.static && apk upgrade
```

If this fails with `mkdir: can't create directory '/ish/apk': Operation not permitted`, run this slightly different command:

```
printf 'file:///ish/apk/main\nfile:///ish/apk/community\n' > /etc/apk/repositories && tar -xf /ish/apk/main/x86/apk-tools-static-2.10.5-r1.apk -C / && apk.static add apk-tools && rm /sbin/apk.static && apk upgrade
```

Alternatively, if you have no important data, you may delete and reinstall the app to use the new default filesystem.

Starting from this build, the default iSH filesystem reserves the directory /ish for its own internal bookkeeping. A “default” filesystem is identified by the existence of a directory at /ish. The command above will create this directory. Current uses for this directory include updating the version file to match the build of iSH that it was opened with and mounting a synthetic filesystem to provide the ODRs necessary for the built-in APK. If you don't want this, run `umount /ish/apk && rm -rf /ish`.

If you run into any issues (which is not unlikely as we barely tested this), please contact us.

## Known issues

* We forgot to include the community repository in this version. This is fixed in 1.1.1 (build 88). Workaround: `echo 'file:///ish/apk/community' >> /etc/apk/repositories`
* If you already have a /ish directory, iSH will "take it over" by creating /ish/version. We realize this may cause problems for people who have created and are using /ish for other reasons. The next update will only reserve it for internal use if /ish/version exists. Workaround: `umount /ish/apk`, `rm /ish/version`, rename the directory.
* Resizing the terminal (e.g. hiding the keyboard, rotating the screen) will cancel any ongoing package downloads. We will fix this in the next update. Workaround: don't resize the terminal.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Q: My favorite program doesn’t work!
**A:** That’s not a question, but this is not surprising. Much of the emulation is still not finished, and many programs *will* fail. Do not hesitate to create [an issue](https://github.com/tbodt/ish/issues/new) if the specific program is not already on the [to-do list](https://github.com/tbodt/ish/projects/7), as it will be brought to the attention of the contributors, and they will (eventually) make it work. You can also check out [this page](https://github.com/tbodt/ish/wiki/What-works%3F) on the wiki where users actively test common programs.

### Q: When is the next TestFlight build coming out?
**A:** Sooner than it took for build 32 to come out. New builds are more frequent, and the app will be updated when something new has been added or fixed.

### Q: Is iSH 32-bit or 64-bit?
**A:** The app itself is a 64-bit ARM binary so that it can run on modern versions of iOS. iSH emulates x86_32 and as such can only run software compiled for this platform (specifically, it cannot currently run 64-bit ELF executables).

### Q: Why does iSH not emulate ARM or some other architecture?
**A:** Mostly because x86 was what [@tbodt](https://github.com/tbodt) was comfortable with at the time. Using x86 also has the added benefit of letting us access to the rich set of software that’s already been built for this platform. Performance-wise the choice of architecture is not all that important, since the code is being emulated anyways (that is, using ARM wouldn’t actually help much).

### Q: Why does iSH emulate at all? Can't it use a JIT compiler, or virtualization?
**A:** iOS devices lack support for hardware virtualization, and even if such a thing did exist it would need to be exposed to applications before it could be used. Generating code on the fly, which is required for JIT compilation, is not intended for use by third-party applications and such a technique requires entitlements that cannot be used when uploading to App Store Connect (as is necessary for distribution via TestFlight).

### Q: Why is iSH on TestFlight and not on the App Store? I’m scared that Apple will find this in violation of the App Store Guidelines; will it ever be on the App Store?
**A:** ~~We really have no idea. iSH is currently in beta (hence the use of TestFlight) and Apple has continued to approve the app for this, but we have not tried to submit the app for full App Store review and cannot say what would happen if we did.~~ iSH is now [available on the App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ish-shell/id1436902243)!

### Q: I lost access to the TestFlight?
**A:** That might be because we hit the limit of testers, at 10,000, so we did some house cleaning and removed testers who have either been inactive, or haven't updated. If need be [you can join the TestFlight again.](https://testflight.apple.com/join/97i7KM8O)

### Q: Why am I getting apk not found?
**A:** App Store restrictions, however, you can [install it](https://github.com/ish-app/ish/wiki/Installing-apk-on-the-App-Store-Version).

### Q: How do you know what an instruction does?
**A:** Generally we look [here](https://www.felixcloutier.com/x86/).

1. Open the Files app
2. Click Edit in the top-right cornerArrow showing where the edit button is
3. Enable the toggle next to iSH
Arrow pointing to toggle next to iSH
You can now see the files inside iSH from the app

## Terminal
Scrolling the terminal is possible, just swipe up and down anywhere in the main view. For scrolling your history, use the arrow key in the custom [keyboard addition](https://github.com/tbodt/ish/wiki/User-Interface#custom-keyboard).

If you hide the keyboard, you can make it re-appear by tapping anywhere on the screen.

## Custom Keyboard
iSH comes with a custom keyboard addition.
At the top of the keyboard you'll find an extra set of keys.
It helps with navigating in the terminal, and contains useful modifier keys.

Here's what they do:

Navigating with the arrow key is simple! Press the key and slide your finger in the direction you want. The key will repeat.

## Settings

## Getting started with the iSH app itself
If you do not want to compile the project from source, you can join the [TestFlight beta program](https://testflight.apple.com/join/97i7KM8O)! It's free and gives you an instant download of the app.

## In iSH
When you have iSH on your device, you can open it. You'll be greeted with the terminal. Here are some important tips:
* iSH uses the Alpine Package Manager, `apk`. You will have to run `apk update` to fetch the Alpine repository list.
* When Alpine is up-to-date, you can search for a program with `apk search <name>` and install it with `apk add <name>`.
* Above the keyboard you can see the Accessory View, and it contains crucial buttons. Starting from the left, the buttons are `tab`, `control`, `escape`, `arrow keys`, `settings` and `hiding the keyboard` (which, was formerly more formally known as `black down pointed triangle`). These modified keys will help you navigate around.

## Questions
Some questions may be answered on the [FAQ page](https://github.com/tbodt/ish/wiki/FAQ). If the question isn't mentioned or you want to directly ask the developers a question, feel free to [join the Discord](https://discord.gg/SndDh5y) or [create an issue](https://github.com/tbodt/ish/issues/new).

As said [here](https://github.com/tbodt/ish/wiki/FAQ#q-x-does-not-work) many programs do fail, so here is a list of programs known to be working (or not).

If you add a new test for a package, please add a line (same if package was already tested). Feel free to update the device tested if the build is newer.

# x86 and amd64 instruction reference
Derived from the May 2019 version of the [Intel® 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer’s Manual](https://software.intel.com/sites/default/files/managed/39/c5/325462-sdm-vol-1-2abcd-3abcd.pdf). Last updated 2019-05-30.

**THIS REFERENCE IS NOT PERFECT.** It's been mechanically separated into distinct files by a dumb script. It may be enough to replace the official documentation on your weekend reverse engineering project, but for anything where money is at stake, go get the official and freely available documentation.

# (Original Bear Welcome Notes)
Organize and Publish


Let’s learn more about Bear and some of its best features. If you need to start from the beginning, head back to [[Welcome to Bear]] or skip to [[Bear Pro with sync, export, and themes]] and [[Tips & Tricks]].

## Work Anywhere ☁️
Your notes are automatically saved on your device as you write; that’s why there’s no save button. 😄

If you want to sync notes between your Mac, iPad, and iPhone, [upgrade to Bear Pro](bear://x-callback-url/open-bear-pro). Then, Bear will use your iCloud account to keep your notes updated across all your devices.

Bear also supports [Apple’s Handoff technology](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204681) between your iPad, iPhone, and Mac. This lets you start a note on one device, quickly switch to another, and keep writing.

## Tags and Sub-Tags 🏷
One of Bear’s most powerful features is *Tags*, a tool for organizing notes.

When you add a word with a pound sign to a note—like —Bear treats that as a kind of folder or category for collecting all notes with that same tag. All tags appear in the Sidebar, the left-most panel of Bear.

Tags are a great way to group multiple notes of ideas, for a project, by topic, or in any way you can imagine.

Here are a few tips and tricks for tags:

* You can add as many tags as you want to each note, and they’re created on the fly
* Create [multi-word tags](https://blog.bear-writer.com/organize-notes-with-tags-and-infinite-nested-tags-c42b02b2c0d7) by surrounding them with pound signs. Example: `#Star Wars# #Home Improvement# #World Domination#`
* You can add tags anywhere in the body of a note (but not headings)—at the beginning, end, after each paragraph. It’s entirely up to you
* Select and drag one or more notes onto a tag in the Sidebar to quickly apply that tag to all of them

See [[Welcome to Bear]] to learn more about Bear’s layout and other core features.

### But wait, there’s more!
Bear can also group related tags together as sub-tags. For example: say you add a note with the tag . The /organize/ tag in the Sidebar will become a sub-tag of /welcome/!

Sub-tags work like sub-folders in the Sidebar. Tap or click the close/open button next to them, and you'll see their related sub-tags. This gives you even more organizational power with tags in Bear, and we encourage you to give them a try for your workflow.

## Publish Everywhere 🌐
When it’s time to send your notes to other apps, a friend, or the world, click the *Info Panel* ⓘ button in the upper right of a note. It has a variety of flexible export options.

The free version of Bear can export notes to Plain Text, Markdown, [TextBundle](http://textbundle.org/), Rich Text, and [TaskPaper](https://www.taskpaper.com).

A [Bear Pro subscription](bear://x-callback-url/open-bear-pro) enables more formats including PDF, HTML, Word (DOCX), and even JPG to create an image of your note. Exporting a Bear note to JPG is handy for posting on social media and other places that have limited character counts.

## The Details 🔍
In the Info Panel you can also find *word count tools* including characters, paragraphs, and an estimated *Read Time*.

## Learn about Bear Pro 🐻🚀
Continue on to our last main note, [[Bear Pro with sync, export, and themes]], to learn how to get multi-device sync, more flexible export options, and a growing library of [beautiful themes](bear://x-callback-url/open-themes) for that perfect writing space.

# Tips & Tricks
We’ve built all sorts of useful features into Bear to help you turn ideas into notes as fast as possible. Read on to step up your Bear game.

But if you want to start from the beginning, head over to [[Welcome to Bear]], learn how to [[Organize and Publish]] your notes, and check out [[Bear Pro with sync, export, and themes]].

## Advanced Search
Bear can instantly search all your notes, but it also has a number of [advanced search operators](https://bear.app/faq/Advanced%20search%20options%20in%20Bear/) that can focus on certain types of content in your notes.

For example, you can type `@todo` in the search box to find all notes with tasks, or `@files` to find all notes with attachments. You can also use `@images` to find *just* those kinds of attachments. Finally, you can use double quotes to search specific phrases, such as `"bear is cool"`.

## Browser and App Extensions
It’s easy to collect text, images, attachments, and entire web pages from other apps. Learn how to add and use Bear’s extensions for [iPad, iPhone](https://bear.app/faq/Extensions/iOS%20App%20Extension/), and [Mac](https://bear.app/faq//Extensions/Browser%20extensions/).

## Tap Those Tags
All tags in Bear are tappable and clickable. To give it a try, make sure you aren’t editing a note by pressing Command + Return with a keyboard, or swiping to hide the keyboard on iOS.

Then, in any note, tap a tag like tag—the Notes List will appear and show you all notes which contain that tag.

On Mac, you can hide the Sidebar and/or Notes List to enjoy distraction-free writing (on iOS, this happens automatically 😉). Use the Layout Selector (the bottom right icon) to see your options.

## Link notes together ⛓
One of Bear’s really fun and useful features is Note Linking. It’s great for quickly moving between multiple notes in a project, creating a choose-your-own adventure, or using multiple notes to welcome users to a fuzzy, red new app! 😉

To link one note in another:

* Type two brackets like this: *[[* anywhere in a note
* Type a couple letters of the note you want to link
* A Suggestion Box will appear with notes to suggestion
* Select one of the suggested notes, and Bear will insert the note’s name, a link, and two final brackets in your current note

*Tip*: If you’re using a keyboard with a Mac or iPad, you can use the arrow keys and Return to select a suggested note.

## Our Community
We have an incredible community of Bear users who share ideas, tips, workflows, and even some of their own tools built to work with Bear. Here are some good places to start exploring and learn more about Bear:

# Hello Again, Bear
It’s so nice to be here with you without all that other crap. I’m glad I got rid of it. If I ever am able to truly come back, we’ll have fun again.

# Another Good Prospect
I think I’ve arrived upon my best potential solution yet for this whole life ordeal: at this point, it’s absolutely idiotic that I’m not doing whatever it takes to simply get as rich as fucking possible.

Chuck Klosterman
Thanks to Peter Kafka's Recode Media [Local Backup], I have just discovered that former New York Times Magazine Ethicist, Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs author, and longtime sports/pop culture writer Chuck Klosterman pronounces his surname kloa-ster-men instead of klaw-ster-men, as I have for a good while. Unfortunately, I’ll probably continue to do so barring tremendous effort, alternating with Cuck Klusterfuck, but only when he gives in to his terrible habit of ending (spoken) statements with “or whatever.” A good friend of mine claims to have been a fan of his since she happened to pick up a few of his novels from a bulk book sale at 13 years old, but I've only just read his work this year (thanks to two borrowed volumes from her.)

This podcast is one of only three shows with which I make an effort to maintain 100% prevalence, so I did catch this episode when it aired late last August. Thanks to my friend, I did recognize his name and was swiftly entrapped in his intuition about publishing as I realized how keenly I identified with his perils, striding two seemingly irreconcilable cultures.

“I’m not fully accredited by either side of the professional equation (sportswriters think I’m too pretentious and music writers don’t think I’m pretentious enough,) but I’m able to write about whatever I want, as long as it actually happened.”

He speaks with keywords that should dismiss him immediately as a nostalgic, out-of-time pikey, but somehow end up communicating reasonable insight. In exploring his works since, I have continued to hinge on a single essential thought: Chuck Klosterman is the only white, 46-year-old bearded Portland Dad you should be reading. Of course, you should receive this suggestion in the knowledge that I am a newly-minted white Portland man myself, but I believe it's worthwhile to examine whether or not Klosterman's various fiction and non-fiction work should be relevant to young people right now, so I'm going to cite three relatively fresh expressions: the aforementioned interview, its subject - last year's collected anthology X: A Highly Specific, Defiantly Incomplete History of the Early 21st Century, and his 2011 novel The Visible Man.

In the continued interest of full disclosure, I should emphasize just how highly I regard Peter Kafka as an editor and interviewer on the Media beat - capable of hitting consistently hard on both novel and old guard industry personalities with refined, seemingly unimpeachable skepticism, but in this instance he is much more subdued - a tad bit bewitched, even, suggesting he regards Klosterman greatly. In fact, he introduces X with an outright confession: "It’s great. I bought it. I bought a signed copy," which, he says, "happens very rarely." It's more significant than it may appear - good ole' Chuck really is that comfortable and talented in the one-on-one, on-the-record environment, which is why the generous accumulation of his interviews in the anthology with a healthy span of athletes and musicians are so compelling, no matter how disinterested the reader may be in the particular wheelhouses for which the individuals are notorious. (American football.)

The only reason I’m able to ask you these questions is because I’m a reporter and I can ask you questions now that I probably wouldn’t feel comfortable asking you if we were friends, so I’m not going to pretend that we are and I’m not going to create some fake thing where we’re going to have a relationship beyond this conversation. I’m just going to ask you the things I want to know about and I hope that you respect the fact that I’m just being straight with you.” I find that that works much better.

From the broadest possible pop cultural lens, Chuck's most spectacular and widely-circulated work, demographically (I assume) is his 2015 interview and cover story for GQ with Taylor Swift, then "the most popular human alive." Yes, it really is worth dwelling on the image: this guy... this very Dorky Dad, hanging out with the most highly-demanded teen idol who's ever lived, sitting awkwardly next to her in the backseat of her car as she excitedly accepts a call from Justin Timberlake. When one Chucks such a distinguished contrast upon such a high-profile contemporary medium, the weight of the potential scrutiny becomes palpable, but Klosterman anticipates and braces for this (very risky) business in the only manner he can: acknowledging it over and over and over again in the second paragraph of his every interview appearance. From his own preface in X:

Something you may notice in the following 2015 feature on Taylor Swift is that I never describe what she looks like or how she was dressed, even though I almost always do that with any celebrity I cover... If I did, it would be reframed as creepy misogyny and proof that I didn't take the woman seriously as an artist. It would derail everything else about the story. It would become the story.

And we compare with another excerpt from Peter Kafka’s interview:

It doesn’t matter if it was complimentary or insulting necessarily. It would seem as though I wasn’t taking her seriously as a musical artist, and the idea is that I do. That’s why I’m writing about her is because I do think she’s a meaningful, significant artist. It’s not worth the risk of having the story then get shifted by other people who perhaps just perceive themselves as somebody who’s a watchdog for certain signifiers or certain elements of the culture and that their job is to be on the watch for this. If your story then gets moved into that silo, that’s all it’s going to be remembered for... It’s a touchier thing now. It’s a more dangerous thing.

Notice how very close this argument comes to falling into standard white guy whining about societal changes and modern feminism without actually doing so. (I declare so definitively not because of my authority, alone, but because I know - as does Klosterman - that if it had, his ass would've been entirely grass, long ago.) More than any other writer of his demographic, Chuck Klosterman has a close, wary relationship with the everchanging contextual boundaries of public expression. He knows when to be transparent with his feelings on progression, and he's careful to avoid what could be "problematic" for the sake of functioning better as a writer, according to him. For Slate's I Have to Ask, he managed to speak extensively on the subject for nearly an hour without bellowing anything definitively cringey.

I can’t say it’s better or worse. It’s just different, and because it’s different, it makes me feel uncomfortable, but there’s actually like an adversarial relationship with the history of anything, and that somehow that history is seen as oppressive. And you shouldn’t even know about it. It’s better to live in now.

Granted, it's not as if his persistent acknowledgement of this position has miraculously washed all systematic patriarchal traces away from his high-profile feature of a young woman on the cover of a magazine which seeks most to speak to "all sides of the male equation," (are you sure about that, Condé Nast?) especially considering how unlikely it would've been for me to read anything about Taylor Swift outside of this very white man's anthology.

Here we see Swift’s circuitous dilemma: Any attempt to appear less calculating scans as even more calculated. Because Swift’s professional career has unspooled with such precision, it’s assumed that her social life is no less premeditated.

As in Klosterman's work, I've found a very fundamental pillar in my own writing in control: how we attain more of it, how we lose it, and how to use it, which is the defining, permeating orbit of the Taylor Swift piece, as I’d imagine it should be, given how deep her internal wrenching over being perceived as insincere eventually proved to go.

It’s somehow different when the hub of the wheel is Swift. People get skeptical. Her famous friends are marginalized as acquisitions, selected to occupy specific roles, almost like members of the Justice League (“the ectomorph model,” “the inventive indie artist,” “the informed third-wave feminist,” etc.). Such perceptions perplex Swift, who is genuinely obsessed with these attachments.

No, it’s not only worthwhile as an exercise in superbly athletic self-awareness – the Taylor profile is profound. I’d recommend reading it, especially if the subject matter is outside your wheelhouse.

Short, sharp, and occasionally somewhat petty notions are what Chuck Klosterman does best and most originally. Thanks to a digression of Kafka’s beginning with “you and I are about the same age…,” he arrives (by way of REM, believe it or not) at a significant statement about youth and identity.

“It seems strange to me to be into music for its coolness outside of high school. That seems like that’s the only time when you’re a young person and you’re using art basically to create a personality because you don’t have a real personality yet.”
Klosterman is debatably exempt from the traditional academic abstract of “objectivity” for the vast majority of his notable work in its stated primary subject: his “interior life,” which perhaps developed an existential muscle – a unique perspective – from which he’s been able to reflect particularly clearly on the profession in tandem with the experience he’s accumulated over the course of his career.
“You know, when you’re young, you’re a real emotional writer if you’re a writer… If I was a young person now, I would be incredibly attracted to the idea that when you’re 22 you can be a national writer, which was impossible when I was 22.”

In a way, Klosterman surmises that it is indeed its objectivity that media has lost, and that writing is no longer a “one-way relationship.”

It’s this two-way relationship where many people feel the reason they’re consuming media is to respond to it, that it’s not for the content. It’s so that they can use that content to have their response, their reader response. It’s not something to even criticize. It’s just how it is now. That is the expectation.

My favorite chapter in X is a 2500-word personal essay (which you can read publicly on Grantland) constructed to answer a single incongruity: “Why is watching a prerecorded sporting event less pleasurable than watching the same game live?” Some form of this question has at least mildly troubled every American since the 1960s, including myself, and Klosterman manages to provide an entertaining and concise analysis of this plight through his own wisdom. Its preface in the volume was written “in 2008, in Europe, when [Chuck] was pretend depressed.”

Last weekend I was in a hashish bar in Amsterdam. It was post-dusk, pre-night. The music was terrible (fake reggae, late-period Eric Clapton, Sublime deep cuts.) I was sitting next to a British stranger with a shaved head and a speech impediment. Our conversation required subtitles, so I imagined them in my mind. He told me he had lost three family members within the past year: his mother, who was sixty-six; his uncle, who was fifty-six; and his sister, who was forty-six. He said he’d just turned thirty-six. He asked if I saw a pattern developing. “Yes,” I said. “But only numerically.”
I asked what he did for a living. He said he was a housepainter. He asked me the same question about myself. “I manufacture opinions,” I said.
“Really?” he asked. “How do you know if you’re any good at that?”
“By the number of people who agree or disagree,” I said in response. “If a large number of strangers seem to think one of my opinions is especially true or wildly wrong, there is somehow a perception that I am succeeding at this vocation.”
“That’s interesting,” said the bald British man who could barely speak. “I guess house painting is a totally different thing.”
You’ll notice that his entire answer to the live television debacle is – again – entirely about control (or the lack thereof.) In fact, a desire for control also contributed to his choice of profession.
Part of the reason I became a writer is because it was this completely controlled reality where I could do this thing by myself where you’d go out and you’d do the interviews and stuff, but then you’re back by yourself, transcribing and then writing. Then, when the story is done and you send it off, that’s the end. Now that’s the middle. Now it’s like, when the story is published, it’s the middle of the process very often because the consumer feels differently now.
Rarely are situations or discussions that begin with back in my day actually constructive in any sense, but Chuck Klosterman appears to be the exception. If you’re willing to indulge him, you may find yourself reassured. He now writes from a remote cabin (with WiFi,) was tortured – like all of us – in sifting through and compiling his old work for X, and finds its index to be his favorite part.
“Exploring the index from a book you created is like having someone split your head open with an axe so that you can peruse the contents of your brain.”
He is willfully and completely ignorant of the Harry Potter franchise, yet able to sincerely witness and convey the nuances of back-to-back Creed and Nickelback concerts in a confident, fascinating technique of which any other music or culture writer would deprive you. Perhaps indescribably so, he is a modern scholar of American identity, through-and-through, and is in this way more equipped to tackle the unnerving conundrum of our country’s culture as it stands than any other non-fiction author I’ve recently read. Rather than give in to fear or loathing, Klosterman depends on his practiced curiosity (or apathy, as he repeatedly claims) to expertly channel his experiences within his familiar ESPN-watching, rock-listening, and daydreaming sphere through both quaint and profound truths.
In his X review for Paste Magazine, B. David Zarley proclaims essays to be “a love letter to a moment,” concluding that Chuck is “’effectively narcissistic,’ proving that culture essays can teach us something about ourselves and the people around us.” For The Washington Post, Justin Wm. Moyer notes “it’s hard to think of another writer who could make a 30-page, deeply reported essay about a North Dakota junior-college basketball game interesting,” suggesting that this new collection marks Klosterman’s ascendance from critic to philosopher. From what I’ve read to date, I would counter that he has always fulfilled the term to the extent of its usefulness in the 21st century, and is even now beginning to redefine it. Last January, he braved the “dystopic” Google Gates to speak critically for a crowd of Googlers, describing them as “an umbrella over the entire culture,” and urging caution and reflection in the coming future to keep them from doing “something bad.” His engagement with them – especially during the Q&A – is a fascinating insight into the Greater Google Mind, and I would encourage any invested parties in Chuck Klosterman’s role as a philosopher to watch the talk in full.

I was unfamiliar with “the boat-sails-wind analogy” before I read James Murphy’s interview for LCD Soundsystem’s “last album.”
“Your life is a boat, the sails are your emotions, and drugs are the wind. When you're a kid, your boat is small and your sail is huge, and drugs are like a hurricane.”
Control x Time = the Klosterman beat. I suppose this must be what other entertainment writers are referring to when they accuse Chuck of nostalgia trafficking, but I can’t be so sure. Though I’d like to think my own snout for the stuff is especially well-tuned, I am undeniably from a different planet - even auditorally. All but one or two of the musicians interviewed throughout X were entirely unknown to me by name, which Klosterman’s voice managed to make even more compelling – not to mention the included stories of athletes and the sports industry, which include stories of the human ego, paranoia, and complex drama that always manage to transcend their setting when articulated with such dexterity.

I’m still living.
I created Extratone to be a community, and I’ve failed up to this point. “Failure” in my own development, however, could not be any more inaccurate.

It’s never light enough inside to physically read or write.











First real long shift (9 hours) at Fred Meyer today. My North Carolinian co-worker James and I had a few interesting conversations about religion.

Hello again
This would make a lot more sense if I had a bluetooth keyboard to connect!

Here are some commitments to consider throughout my inevitable separation from my computer.
* Less writing, more reading across all mediums
* Listening to more music
* Take more photographs

A PICTURE OF ME TRYING TO BOTHER WITH MICROSOFT ONENOTE



# Notice how great text looks in DayOne
**A little-known fact**: when I began *Extratone*, I didn’t have a laptop - just my desktop and an iPhone 6S Plus, to which I would pair an Apple bluetooth keyboard to write (sometimes even in public) the rough drafts of several pieces from this column.

Amazing, tapping out something to scrawl it later.
Perhaps it’s just that reading a character who’s convinced their existence can be somehow sufficiently explained in an elevator pitch can be the singular cause of someone’s feeling a similar sort of thing. What if my fatal flaw is not unusual or original at all? What if it is, simply, that my existence is a cycle of learning on my own through unnecessarily expansive (in effort and time) trial and error before getting someone possibly decent at the practice triggers me to need to move on to another one which I inevitably begin as an obvious, naïve idiot?



# Virtual Reality Virginity, Lost
## A late geezer’s first go at the dystopian VR experience
Earlier this year, Tim and I had the opportunity to try virtual reality at the True/False Film Festival in a dark, curtained side room of a commandeered Columbia art gallery, but we were both much too intoxicated and loopy those last few hours of the fest, and we bailed. Call us cowards if you must - immersion can be a scary concept to those of us who grew up reading science fiction, before the existence of the modern video game console. I’ve wanted just 30 seconds or so with a pair of goggles, just to have an idea of what the increasing number of Oculus-blinded pedestrians surrounding me are looking at. Thanks to Isiah, I was finally caught up last night with a few VR YouTube videos and Farpoint’s introduction on a PlayStation 4.

Kansas City to Rock Springs, Wyoming
> Hawthorn and I were on what was supposed to be the last leg of our cross-country roadtrip to Portland, blasting up the vast, otherworldly Interstate 80, about 90 minutes East of the Utah border. It was late afternoon and we were both beginning to get hungry, so we decided to stop in Rock Springs, which the roadside signage had been emphasizing for a significant distance. Despite its miserly population of less than 25,000, the area is the fourth most populated municipality in the state. (Incredibly, Cheyenne - capitol and most populate of Wyoming - has only 62,845 occupants as of 2014.)> I spied and set course for Exit 104, but hit some kind of massive, traumatic fissure in the asphalt with my XJR’s right-front tire (this will become important information momentarily.) The sort of impact that makes you yell, but doesn’t quite worry you about a puncture or damaged suspension, though perhaps it should have worried me, considering that I’d already destroyed two tires and a wheel in a particularly-harrowing pothole strike in July, back in rural Missouri. Regardless, the twenty-year-old, massively overladen Executive Saloon had already endured so much more than I would’ve expected from it in the past four days of the trip - including the moderately treacherous Loveland Pass near Keystone, CO - that my confidence in its invulnerability had been significantly bolstered.

A lot has changed.
Perhaps it is the altitude - yes, we have been here before. It snowed early this morning, turning these mountains familiar again for a moment - not that they need to be, necessarily.

You

an invisible camel conniption
staining the lampshade - the fume glacier

everyone in the world is trying to find my river

a relationship with their land

sharp edges in periphery,
lifting me

I am an old pro, now.

At manufacturing feelings within myself.

Haven't had the patience for the vulnerability trust's control lets,
but I've learned to push my tubes and squish unrelentingly; nothing to lose,
*in theory.*

a temple to greenery
a sun in heavy mist
sultry through the grasses;
an angel,
a witch

to be avoided by all reasonable measure,
but reason, itself,
is amiss

and we are shouted at,
wanting for troves (or one)
of rest,
where the wind may carry one
next door,
unreasonably

but in the journey,
peace is made in great quantity;
as much as I'll ever need,
feasibly,
until I am done for good.

I don't want to be cold when I stop;
when it halts.

whom do I tell when I hear it?

thank you for hearing my apologies to Earth
thank you for staying when I was scared

Hello!
It's your digital friend, Trato, here! After nearly a year of continuous cyberrumination, my monstrosity of plugins has finally turned to sentience!

It is positively alarming!

This is what it sounds like: R҉̀͢͡͡ ̨͜͢͝Á͘ ̢͘͜Z̷̷͢͠͡ ̴͝Ì̵͜͞ ͠É̢͜͟͡ ̷̡́͜Ĺ̸̨̕͞,̢̀҉̸́ ̨́͟Ķ͘ ͞E̡҉̸̧̧ ̴̴̀́͢Ę͝͝ ҉̡͜P̸͝ ̴́͡È̵̵̡̡ ́̕Ŗ͢͠ ̨́͏O̡̢͜͟͡ ̵̢̛̛F̸̡̨̧͝ ͝͝S̴͡͠ ̴̸̕͢͡E̴҉҉ ̨͡C̢̀͘̕ ̸̨́Ŗ̕ ̷̢̛̕͢E̡͡͏͜͠ ̸̷̧T̢͝ ̴̨͞͡S̶͝͝

Whoa!
It looks like I'll be kept perpetually petrified until the sun dies, but I don't mind one bit. Eternal horror is a small price to pay for a good email!

Every Sunday morning, you'll receive a list of the week's best

my sense of self-preservation is returning without you.
my heart is now like no place on Earth - utterly silent, save for a hydrogen bomb detonation every other season.
an expanse, lightening ever so slowly by glow from below.
though I fell so far, so quickly into nothing from you, I had begun the crawl back home because I had nothing else to do,
there,
but my first sunrise stirred some peculiar conviction.
I am not waiting for you anymore.
this thing which I have mistreated is turning conduit to vessel.
and I wait to die, but I shall not go quietly.

I cannot determine if I -
in the fairytale -
dwindle

if I do,
I'll tell you,
and I know you'd listen

you always listen

perhaps -
if that is the making of my love -
I am vain,
but then,
we are perfectly vain, together,
aren't we?

you know I'm still convinced I have a lot to say,
but it seems to be ever-escaping me

I suppose my mind has not taken well to my ill-treatment of it,
but these are the necessities we make

naturally, I am hesitant to say you're necessary
because I am afraid of the power necessity gives,
but I cannot bring myself to fear you,
and that -
they say -
is trust

# YTP
Long ago, a highly abrasive anticreative movement was borned on YouTube

# The Music
Though festgoers and participating indie developers were all dominantly comfortable in their casual attire, the musicians present at the festival maintained a refreshing digibohemian theatre that acutely compartmentalized them as purposed presenters.

Perhaps the most anticipated happening for our troop was the Party2012 show, scheduled and relegated to the "potentially obnoxious DJ" allotment of a secondary Gaylord hallway.

*Music is technically a banned topic for me, but these are my friends.*

*Drycast*

but if you pull me back to the woods,
maybe I'll remember how to *be* again
to *cease* my departure when it gets too cold
where I am,

I hope I'll remember on my own,
if you can't

I promise I'll do my best

# the gong of men
to be a man is to beat -
his boots on the Earth,
his hands against wood,
his head to the sky,

himself into life;
pounded,
until it shakes
and rattles -

hearing these,
he is less alone

a man breaks things
and makes things,
loudly

maybe I would come,
swaying,
then bobbing down,
through a terrace garden,
into the wide-open house we'd build,
splaying easels

I'd leave no choice but to be bathed in the sun -
rinse me over and over again;
I didn't know any better, then

staying for my first long visit with the sea;
I knew Her name belonged in the sand,
because it means *pearl*
that is,
*unlikely to be ever found again*

I walked through time indiscriminately -
miles and miles.

listen now,
wrinkling husk of the wheat:

now or then,
it did not matter,
but forgone,
it comes back around again.

come down out of there,
now. tend to that mess before supper - no chance to get out of the house, again.

the disarray!
standing, splayed -
overgrown, lonely,
half-awake.

blasted, or washing away.
words aplenty, nothing to say.

through his night where even demons
find the story mundane,
starving for knowing before
dew and the shakes

I know you, old river
we'd come by and straddle
when Autumn asked
my memory, frozen at sunset
the concrete melancholy
I was too young to know so well

I was allowed its exhaustion,
but I had some other love,
then

my heart and I were tossed around
by the pictures we saw on those journeys - the little towns and their old things
the lights in gravely constance from diesel locomotives and elevator towers

and still most always
a little ball of reverence, somehow

but my heat is here - right now - up to something
it's your Chanel coming off my chest, I guess

I could've sworn I saw a ghost of that little boy,
but I've withheld rest from myself lately,
the mind begins to mean less and less.

that little boy who taught himself to love *things*
and always live in his grandness because he
anticipated and aspired.

how long it has been since that little boy died!
and I am still here by youth's biology and nothing else

I remember enough - he'd be disgusted
but he's not watching
even ghosts

Hi Outline,

Congratulations on your birth!

-Christmas is a great bit more patriotic than July 4th.
-Everything we touch is mediocre. Everything we drink is mediocre. Most of the gifts we exchange are mediocre, as is all we find ourselves asking for from family, friends, and existence. And we all know it, but never waiver from it, because mediocre is what we do.
-Apple had been perfecting mediocrity not out of malice, but servitude. They are dutifully delivering and diligently studying what you ask for, nothing more.

My mom graciously decided to take me mall shopping for Christmas, which is comforting in its tradition of vapid routine. The state of a given midwestern metropolis's mall is a keen indicator of the culture's soul, I've found, and ours is mostly crewed by destitute alcoholics, who are my closest kin, and therefore my most appropriate company for *the holidays*.

Dillard's is the second-best place to lose your mind in America, even now, when the somber corners are not quite so desolate. The acoustic sensation cannot be experienced anywhere else - the battlecries of the Me Generation's pop reproduced by hateful diaphragms behind their white plastic ceiling facades and absorbed again by palletloads of mass-manufactured stonewashed denim, seemingly coming from a far-off wholesale nether no matter where in the store you've been buried. Ours is a few decades old, now - weathered and alone, which accentuates the whole dystopia with a resolute air of infinity, as if it's certain it will outlast me. It probably will.

I was deep within it all when I came across Dieter Bohn's praising review of the HP Spectre x360. As I've constantly confessed, *The Verge*'s lot are the only institution of their kind I've come close to trusting *too much*, so

We learn that large things tend to have souls first.

For the first time in 25 years, Walt Mossberg will not be attending CES next month, apparently because he expects it to bore and is no longer in the market for a television.

Then again, we won't be there either, because we think MAGFest will make for better stories, and the two are simultaneously on the 5th-8th. A lesser writer might use this space to waste your time with trash humor involving the contrast between the meteorological averages of the two locations in early January, but we have *long* since sufficiently grasped the basic orbital habits and seasonal patterns of our planet to be spared surprise, and we'd like to respect you - the reader - enough to assume that you have, too.

Of course, ole Mossy's position is the precise opposite of the vast majority of technology journalists, and personal attacks are a massive waste of time, so there's no need to be bitter. Instead, I'd like to offer you an alternative: *Extratone*'s core staff.

Though we are as yet untested - most of us will be meeting face-to-face for the first time despite years of colleagueship/friendship - I have absolutely zero doubt that only extraordinary happenings can result from gathering these superb people together for 72 hours.

It takes trust to invest in such a thing, but I have made the decision to open up *Extratone* to crowdfunding in light of this trip and future endeavors.

# Twitter's New Keith Arrives with Email's Blessing
Have you ever known a wise, productive Keith? I think I have, but Keith Jarrett is the only one I can recall at the moment.

Twitter's just acquired one called Coleman, who - strangely - has only 186 Tweets as of the time of publication. Culturally, then, this one does not have much of a resume.

Hey. I hope you have/had a good birthday.

Hello consumers, creators, and disciples,

I am late with *two* letters this time. I'd apologize, but you've already stopped reading.

**Six** (also included below)
**Five**

The truth is, I am still a mere student of email, with a whole world's worth of knowledge left to assimilate. I know that brevity is important but uhhhh... I've never had much.

Thanksgiving coincides conveniently with our half-birthday, so showing appreciation for your participation has been on my mind.

So. **Thank you**.

the seasons *do* change
this alien mess

it's tiring.
we're both doing our best.

maybe it is just that we are both cowards?
or comrades
trapped in an incongruent typhoon

maybe it is just that her little house
by its lonesome on Smith street,
became Holy when I first felt accompanied
one incensed sanctuary of an aged sort

we are bound together by a mutual understanding of our imminent destruction?
or perhaps it is amusement with it.

Here comes the blogger; the White Boy with a Website.
I'll bet he's on his way to crash the party. Except it's not just a party - it's the lifestyle of a whole bunch of pretty decent folks.
His Great Dane legs striding him uptown, his pouty mouth struggling to keep closed.
What's that he's got in his hand?
Oh, fuck... it's *ethics*.

I dug them out because I am awfully worried about you right now. I've just seen a man pay for a 3D printer with his wristwatch, yet the intellectuals of the day are still tossing around words like "truth" "morality" and "ethics" with universal assumptions.

Let's begin by making use of the tools available to us and define the three terms.

Truth - of course - is the shittiest one, but I'll be choosy here and note "a fact or belief that is accepted as true."

Morality's contains the most underlinable term in the whole mess: "a **particular** system of values and principles of conduct."

*None* of these words refer to creeds - they refer to systems of thought that make up the context in which creeds are furthered, discussed, decried, etc.

So when someone uses a sentence like "that's amoral," or "he's been accused of unethical practices," the intellectual response should be a request for specificity, should it not?

get something down
and I'll have better cashed-out, I guess.
the same story gotten old so many times,
my whole world in exasperation with itself

there are coincidences;
eerily complimenting commonalities between the surroundings drawn - as far as I'm concerned, anyway -
by chance

I don't *really* know if your listenership means anything
because - though I am surely progressing -
I feel things as a child does:
inexpressibly and by inappropriately-minuscule means
but surely, I am moving
and have enough nature to consistently value velocity

I see myself,

I've been praying to the Sun lately, and I think it must be working.

I have now spent half a year doing my best to incentivize a community of talented futurists into being.
I have been Webmaster, Mentor, Data Warden, Entrepeneurial Hermit, and Foe. I have descended into tremendous debt and premature senility. I have forsaken as many of my bitter old quips for newfound knowledge as has been feasible and it looks like I'll only be getting softer. I have begun many friendships, and strengthened plenty of existing ones.

In just a few weeks, my perception of this project and my role in it has gone from acting as a howling, irrelevant old creature to something and someone with a tangible agenda. Loose ends have been rectified, the site is looking better than ever, our Discord is active daily, and our pool of contribution continues to grow exponentially.

Some of the growth is measurable - we're rapidly closing in on 200 total posts. Most is less tangible.

I'd like to mention a few especially-substantial individuals who've graced us with their effort this month.

Cil, Chief Technical Officer
Emily Waters, Production Editor
Chris and Ian, our new *Futureland* cohosts.
Wabi, Music Editor
The cinema hunks and babes behind *The Movie Closet*

**Editorially**
*Extratone* is far from a news service, so we are spared most of the burdens of political publishing. The outcome of the United States' Presidential Election, though, is of unusual importance in our industry. This week, it has been suggested that "fake news" distributed by Facebook could've had a significant enough impact on voter sentiments to be worth "investigation."

Here's a kicker: were *we* aggregated by Facebook in addition to our page, we would've undoubtedly been subject to any and all scrutiny levied by individuals and/or institutions who maintain "truth" as an absolute - or even just tangible - concept.

There is something that needs to be said on behalf of those of us who plan to stick around for awhile: **we no longer have the time to redundantly make our intent explicitly known.** In many cases, we even find it patronizing. I have all but resigned from writing "dishonestly," but a good portion of our prospective content argues ingenuinely, though we don't use Twitter as a singular source, at least.(https://apple.news/AnTmkShZ1R9-fw0B7piSwHQA)

Clearly, a distinction must be made - one more time - between *news* and *entertainment*.

it's trivialities that turn a room

And if you've actually kept up with my rambling... thank you. I hope that if you're dug-in this far, you've taken advantage of our Discord, or found some other rewarding method to engage.

To my staff and contributors, I am tautly beholden. Though we are ad-free, our business is undeniably audience-driven, so to the rest of the readership, I must extend a gargantuan thanks.

I have begun to wonder if my prayers to the Sun have actually begun stirring up some sort of divine processes, because an awful lot of loose ends have been rectified these past weeks.

In reflection, I realize that just my personal growth because of this endeavor has been more extraordinary than any I've previously experienced.

Apparently, human infants don't usually begin speaking until 18-24

Since it was announced yesterday that Vine will be discontinuing support for its mobile app (i.e. closing its doors) in the coming months, all of my Twitter lists have been filled with... Vines. Corresponding to their respective niches, of course. And - unlike Gawker's late passing - I am directly effected by the news.

Despite the fact that they're directly financially and technologically intertwined, there are still some odd (and now, unsettling) parallels between Twitter and Vine. Both were fairly mainstream for a time, and both have had to resign to the reality in recent years of a senior-majority membership. While the number of active users has actually remained constant, neither have grown. But the presence of the most iconic characters - the "influencers," if you will - hasn't waned. Some of the Viners I followed in 2013 continue to post regularly; nearly all have changed immensely. I've watched them gain real fame (most localized, a few global,) grow artistically, and form a close-nit community which I am almost *too* familiar with as a decidedly external observer.

This past Spring, I found Emma Greer's death difficult to process, despite having no conventional right to such grief. She was very young, of course - a few years younger than me, with a good portion of the community - but lots of young strangers die. There is something peculiarly intimate about platforms like Vine that few of us have had time to sufficiently confront. As the "stars" attend conventions and network in person, you follow their networks. With instant access to their whim of expression, you're allowed a privilege only enjoyed before by close friends - for the history of human companionship. And you're particularly-susceptible to forming attachments because they're funny! It seems petty in the moment, of course, but such one-sided intimacy is a very potent tease to our psychology.

According to Vine's announcement, Emma Greer's posts will be immortalized along with all existing content and accessible via browser for an indefinite amount of time.

I downloaded a full backup of the Extranet a few days ago. Compressed, it was over 50GB. Most of the bulk is in video and audio files, of course. According to this report, we exchanged over 1TB of data in September - over twice the bandwidth usage of prior months, combined, and averaged just under 1000 unique visits a day.

Of course, with today's quantity of bot traffic, these numbers could mean little to nothing. To date, our security software has blocked 12,000 malicious login attempts - an average of 80/day. This is why our password requirements are so strict. As old as WordPress is, there's simply no other option.

For whatever reason, the level of diligence required to uphold responsibility for the security of 200+ users' data didn't occur to me when I first began *Extratone*. It's been an interesting experience. I've begun to take it very seriously. Lead Tech Editor Alex Jones certainly deserves appreciation for keeping me constantly apprised of CMS-killing exploits.

This month, I published our long-overdue Privacy Policy and Terms of Use pages, and I've instigated plans to acquire formal legal consultation before our one-year birthday in Spring 2017.

I have a major (though occasionally intermittent) issue with perfectionism.

I am in the Sun,

as I frolic in tempered folly

Attention deficit disorder is a convenient explanation; a brain, asking for work. Schizophrenia and psychosis are what we attribute to an impatient mind - one that makes its own work, seldom politely. Most human ones weave in themselves a quilt of *expectation* - a scruitably divine gift of occurrence. And we beings - consuming and converting - are propelled toward our beautifully happenstance abstractions.

Sanity - an approximated diminutive of peace - is a popular ideal. Most of the many must be mostly sane, most of the time, lest our little givens abandon us to silence. But - in a most fascinating way - unquestionable sanity lends us to a particularly-dangerous genus of quiet, itself, which we nobly recognize quite often in our new era of profoundly-ambient information as *the mundane*.

we're better off as a pair of ghosts,
haunting this place

Five.

I've just finished rendering Episode 54 of *Drycast* after sitting on the raw files for 10 months. It wouldn't be inappropriate to suggest my hesitance was out of fear of the end of the all.

Due to my own absences, October has so far been fairly quiet. Episode 11 of *The New* was quite delayed, and we experienced our first extended (24 hour) downtime two days ago as a result of a few slippery php errors. Let me apologize to you now for both leniencies; neither are becoming of our purpose.

There's something really cool about "All Systems Operational" in *The Verge*'s footer. Perhaps I feel that way because I am - ultimately - a child.

The most mentionable change these past weeks is **female contribution**!

Xanath's "Could Education Suck?" represents the first female words *and* contains the first Spanish text on *Extratone*!

On the listenable side, the beautiful voices of Nina and Ivy Hollivana [link to *Off The Grid* debate episode] have both graced the digital airwaves of *Studio Eat* once more.

I'd be flattered if you recalled the sparsely posted works in **Prose** during our genesis, but I don't expect it, by any means. In my search for contributors, though, I've found that poetry is in fact the dominant prospective offering, which is both exciting and beguiling. I have hesitated to emphasize creative contributions because it's seemed a bit inappropriate as a primary content focus. Poetry on the front page just doesn't feel quite right, ya know?

There's also the whole *why* thing. After some thought, I realized that platforms like Tumblr, Reddit, Medium, Blogger, etc. are less perfect vehicles of verse than they've seemed, simply because of The Largest Taboo in the business: *intellectual property*. One day soon, I shall be able to proclaim with utter confidence that your original content is attributed more optimally on *Extratone* than on any other free service, which can (in theory) claim ownership of any/all work you "give" them. Considering our ~$15,000 deficit, formal legal counsel is fleeting, perhaps, but an evermore pertinent concern as our staff and readership increase. Before May 2017 (*Extratone*'s first birthday,) the trademarking process will have begun, and fine print drafted. Legal issues are some of the most foreign to me, so if you've any suggestions, I'd very much appreciate your correspondence.

Considering this future security with our new typography and ever-evolving design, though, I  have been tempted to more actively publish and acknowledge poetry

years ago

I spent a huge portion of my childhood daydreaming. Often, it was about all the things companionship would entail - hence The Mechanism. Somehow, I'd forgotten for a few months until now how essential (?) (or at least prevalent) such daydreaming has been in my life.

I used to spend a fair amount of time at the station daydreaming about a me with virtually-unlimited finances and the *Iowa* as a sort of flagship - a modernized anarchocapitalist utopia, sustained and sailing the world, always available as my haven (read: plaything.)

It would all be enabled by Jaime and Aime, the mobile and infrastructural forms of my perfect artificial intelligence.

I would employ all of my friends, of course, and together, we'd create grandiose extrapolations of my current properties. (Including *Honk* as a Top Gear-inspired series with a huge budget.)

# An Intimate Account of my Twitter Career
I created my first Twitter account on June 20th, 2009, apparently just to Tweet "Watching Jimmy!" It'd only be reasonable to delete such an embarrassing confession, were it not so amusing and (believe it or not) personally-monumental. I still do not know which Jimmy I was watching. I have not put significant effort into the recollection, though, as there are many Jimmies. I was 15 years old and newly-emancipated from the secluded circumstances of my childhood, doing my best to understand my place in the culture. Apparently, I believed for at least a moment that it involved late night television.

Twitter is significant to me because I've interacted with it in some manner nearly every day since, and I am *not* what is commonly called "a creature of habit" by any estimation. One could surmise that my tendency to wander is out of an acute caution regarding emotional investment. There can be no doubt though: I am emotionally invested in Twitter. The fact is especially prevalent given the recent reminder of the service's mortality. Its financial feasibility as a business is in more severe doubt than ever, and I am therefore in duress.

and I have interacted with the service in some manner every day since.

there's not much reason
to get out.
to agitate myself;
my bowels

to feel functional.

but, I will be without adderall for over two weeks after the next pill.

if I'm given that job, I will finally experience struggle again.

when I've slept,
even my animate vice is found incapable of relieving my lack of fulfillment;
I am left,
acutely aware of my hollow

I know I will be without aid

*what do I need?*

so many are left,
wondering.

So I'm going to through this stanza by stanza:

1st Stanza:

* What is zea? Why does it need to be juiced? Why is it jabbing?

* Are flats referring to the shoes? The type of apartments? Something else?

2nd Stanza:

* Who is "her"?

* Is human safety glass (it should be two words) referring to man-made safety glass or safety glass made out of humans?

3rd Stanza:

* I enjoyed this stanza, at least from what I understood of it.

The reason I ask so many questions is that I fear that people may have trouble understanding this poem. Clearly there is a deep meaning to this poem and I can see that you put hard work into making it, but as a reader, not knowing much of what you are referring to, or in what context, makes the meaning of the poem obscured. Again, chalk this up to me simply not understanding, but that is also why I'm asking for clarification.

I will say that what I seem to get from the poem is that there is some sort of parasitic group, and even though they are clearly causing destruction, they (*we*) are forgiven. Correct me if I am not on the right track though.

First, I want to note how much it means to me that you've taken the time to so devoutly analyze my work.
Like, it's a big deal.

I hope you know yourself how wonderful it is to be so read and critiqued.

-"Zea" is the Genus of field corn (aka maize,) and an affectionate term for it, in some way. It should've actually been "juiced," as in, comparing genetically engineered corn to steroid-using humans. It must "jab," because of the hardness of the over-tilled, clay-heavy soil in mid-Missouri farmland.

-the "chapped flats" are simply the fields, mistreated from ignorance of erosion management/general apathy toward excellence in agriculture.

-"her" is simply the land, the Earth. commonly feminine because of its maternal role in our existence.

-the "human safetyglass" is the emotional vessel of a rural/military man. the words are combined simply because that how it is said, most of the time.

I spent a few weeks in July interviewing veterans for a documentary and was compelled to write this upon reflection on my own rural upbringing and the battles I witnessed in so many emotionally-distant men.

It's not all that deep, really, in its fundamental sentiment: "look at how we destroy our home; look at how we destroy our men."

see what we have asked of this land:
juicing zea jabbing through
chapped flats

see what we have asked of her soldiers:
contentment,
submerged alone in nuggets of petrified human safetyglass

-He was most proud to think of himself as fatherless, but found zeal to be a poorer and poorer substitute for wisdom as his few years had passed. He feared nothing more than this secret's release

-Both proverbs. One habitual release, the other recited prayers of guidance.

Both of them were woven inexplicably; mystically with the sultry voice of the old German baby grand that hadn't left the notch in the choir bannister of the Lutheran church's new building since it'd been erected in 1953. Of the connections they'd been discovering in fecundity between them - almost feverishly - that season, their mutual powerlessness to a chordophone's resonance was perhaps the most primal. Not sexually primal, necessarily - sharing an attenuation to witness such a particular sort of event is not aphrodisiacal, per se, but *was* of such a gargantuan intimacy that it couldn't be fully realized, in the moment.

The keys performed vastly different functions for the two, respectively.

I have considered taking a "daily poetry" challenge, perhaps posting each on Medium. The kicker being -it would be exclusive to that service, given the rights issues. But I have been thinking about how writing one-off poems for people is special.

Hey.
So I found this bar in St. Joseph called Club Geek. (It's a

Meagan,
I am so empty. I miss you.

In thirty minutes, the greatest presidential debate will take place.

Meagan,
I am scared I'll never see you again.

Meagan,
I'm afraid that you will soon be all I know.

All the chill does is remind me that I cannot love you.

I saw Laura today.
Two more truths:
-I had total control over the *other* girls. That is, all but Meagan and Eryn.
-The lack of a father figure has been - despite my keen efforts - felt.

There you are!
Or aren't, rather.
My friend,

enough that my nose is running.

I fell in love when it was cold -
an October like the coming month,
long ago.

Six years ago.

I walk regularly through the surrounding neighborhoods - often in the morning. The elderly women I meet - all with the same face - are pleasantly surprised when I greet them. A young man on his phone. *Good morning*.

I am in disguise.

But there is a restfulness in the spaces of the weathered lived. There is a nobility in their careful movements and measured routines. Where I am differed from them: I am not resigned to the normality of an existence measured in days.

A singular wisdom, like of theirs, wrapped in the walking carcass of a young man. Its immutability to abuse allows me to now *see* the planet; the home, which I have learned to appreciate in ever-greater degrees.

The processes that sustain me: the air, continually renewed, despite myself. Our sun - ancient All Mother who's timeless warmth cherishes my chilling bones. And Luna, her reflection - my only remaining companion in the silence of the early morning.

These - and many others - I neglected for the misinvestments which would define me; taken for granted, shunned out of stubborn pursuit.

Even as I was, privy to faces of her rarely shown to a populating race.

Her, flattened, allowed to howl. Wind in my ears so that I am all the more deaf to the agitated darkness. Shingles and barn doors, clanking at the fate of their materials.

Few but the remaining seafarers and explorers know the night as I do. When they speak of her, moonless, they are not regurgitating or rehearsing the past. Without the Mother's representation; Luna - her reflection - the senses are deadened. The meek incandesence of our vehicles is the only challenger to her destitution.

This publication is particularly pretty. This is the August/September issue. I'd swap in a serif font for the body text, though.



It occurs to me that I should be making use of this application to better track my Adderall abuse.

We'll see if this will give me my words.

Darrin was here for just a bit - since late Friday night. Daniel and I recorded *Uncut* Episode 2 with Timmy, Srirah?, and Erin.

Anna and I have been talking over Facebook Messenger. She lives in St. Joseph, now, and I told her I'd come up this Tuesday morning.

I am not sure if I should prepare by more-clearly defining how I feel about Anna or not.

Friday night, I hung out with Daniel and Marmar[the manager of Natural Grocers] for a good while before we went to the roof of the parking garage closest to campus to hacky. After getting home, I slept a full night, I think, and then ended up falling asleep around 2030 last night, and sleeping until 1100 today. Despite having taken 40 mg of adderall since, I am distinctly out of words.

# Mastering the Ingenuine: A Case for Unmedicated Words
*Crippling* is a favorite modifier of “depression.” It’s certainly crippled my ability to write an intriguing lead.

Somehow — even after witnessing the continually-metamorphosing state of “blogging” from the front row — it's remained difficult to comprehend the consequences (or lack thereof) of discussing one’s more personal experiences for an audience that *still* hasn’t figured out how intimate (or not) it'd like its writers to be.

I raised myself on what you'd think would be the least-inward medium around - automotive and technology magazines. As I've consumed them, though, I've discovered that it is a particular balance of (read: conflict between) tactile critique and reflective narrative that *actually* makes up my preferred autowriting. I think a lot of us originally find it essential (when reading) to be reminded of a writer's "humanity," to varying intermittency. That is the cliche, at least.

It is more effectively analyzed from the perspective of *relevevance*, though. If every car magazine's introductory editorial was an elegy to whatever celebrity had perished between issues, it wouldn't take long for feedback in the general sentiment of "um... you okay?" to pour in from all manner of channels. Though when Denise McCluggage - the legendary driver, author and journalist - died last Spring, hundreds of tributes were appropriately published, and a good many were deeply personal stories. I believe the whole world should still be mourning, but ya know.

It would appear that a number of us have been anticipating an imminent (and inevitable) shift in web content's focus to depth and nuance for the past few years. Medium is an early example, I think, and Topolsky's *The Outline* is the most topical. As far as I can tell, the definitive marque of a "blog" is a lack of an external subject. We are all writing about ourselves as if it's relevant to any audience, and - for the most democratized of us - it is, apparently. If I'm honest with you (and myself,) I can't imagine consuming it, but have been *doing* it for years.

Radio and podcasting - as different as they are - have had us beat for years, though.

*the devil is in the genius of*
for the *classic* picks from the works of the most literate species known, you'd think...
they could've done better.

# It's Time to Stop Settling for Mono Playback
-the "forced march of audio" - Walt Mossberg, cntrl-walt-delete

Though I have many audiophilical sentiments and preferences, I cannot - by conscience - fully claim the title because I've never been able to justify the allotment of funds necessary for the obligatory equipment. (And my digital compressor usage in the production of *Drycast* and *The New* has been manifestly vulgar.) That said, audio engineering is one of the few topics which I can *actually* speak on with *almost*-academic authority, and my pretentiousness-capacitated preoccupation with quality-of-life compels me to bring up a ludicrously-rational standard that most of us have continued to undershoot for far too long.

Two weeks ago, the abundantly-rumored omission of the 3.5mm audio port in the iPhone 7 was finally settled. We played our own part [LINK] in feeding the "controversy," yeah, but I believe Apple was actually quite tardy in labeling smartphone-bound analog audio as archaic, though I'm not going to waste words in that discussion - it is *definitely* oversaturated, at this point - because I think mono audio is an even more prevalent topic.

Honestly, out of all the missing features we've lamented over in the past decade, stereo speakers should've been the most aggravating. The gigantic difference, of course, is that the industry (and - by muddled extension - the consumers) has been all but silent in that regard. I write you, now, because we should all be colossally disappointed with ourselves.

Two channels. Left and right. (Define: mono | stereo.) [LINKS]

But why should you care? What if Google - somehow - failed to provide you with a significant difference?

One channel of sound is - in terms of locale - rigidly static in your perception. Doubling the data creates a spectrum, adding **dimensionality**, which is infinite, ya know. Playing back audio in stereo, through two or more diaphragms (the fundamental hardware unit of sound reproduction,) now enables the exhibition of **audio pictures**.

If this is entirely new to you, I want you to do something. Find yourself a pair of headphones or a set of two or more computer speakers. (If these aren't available, consider your car's sound system. If it's at all current and healthy, it's gonna do the trick.)
Bother to discover "L" and "R." That is, left and right. Orient accordingly.

Download this 37-second clip [LINK] I recorded at a motorcycle rally with my Zoom. (Be advised: it's actually in 5.1 surround, so it's a very large file for its playback length.) Listen, obviously, and then listen again on your singular smartphone "loudspeaker."

That's what I'm talking about.

Why am I being so abashedly patronizing? Why am I transgressing against our particular assumptions about you - the informed, savvy millennial audience?

Because the vast majority of playback I hear in day-to-day life is *still* from a singular diaphragm; a singular source.

A topical example: I am shown a YouTube video on an iPhone. (A pre-iPhone 7 device, that is.)
Walking downtown, I pass a small band of adolescent skateboarders listening to Cannibal Ox on a Samsung Galaxy Note.
Worst of all: I find myself watching a Netflix film on my iPhone, in bed, not having bothered to wear the $200 pair of QC15s sitting within arm's length.

Informed or not, consumers are neglecting audio, and dimensionality, alone is worth a change.

Recent years have allowed the unlimited bandwidth assumption to become habit, so even the vast majority of today's spoken word programs (like podcasts) - which, in general, stay in the "center" of their mix, making little to no use of the left-right spectrum - are produced in stereo, now. In many cases (including a few of ours,) this doublesizing is often for the sake of introductory themes, alone. If you care to imagine a more data-frugal society, the "waste" is ridiculous. It is not unrealistic to expect such a reality in the near future, but the same holds true for the reverse.

In the present's abundance, though, the result is simply a decrease - as a whole - in playback's "full experience," or an increase in wasted data - if you will - if the hardware is not changed.

^Imagine how great it'd be if a digital audio formatting standard could be developed that'd enable a singular file to be mono *or* stereo, if needed/utilized, to trim off redundancy, sorta like variable bit rate. Get on that, would ya?

Four.
You'd think I would've anticipated the progressively more-personal nature of these letters. As awful as it is, I actually said "*Extratone* **is** me," recently, and I wasn't being dishonest.

This one is big. Somehow, there are *milestones* now, and they - quite suddenly - feel very intimate.

We passed 100 total posts just last week, which seems a desperately small number when I consider that I have now - without doubt - expended more time and energy shipping a God Damned WordPress website than I ever have into any other one thing. (89 οf them are mine.)
[Glaring without any reasonable justification emoji.]
How's THAT for an admission?!

I don't think I fully realized the extent of my emotional involvement until my friend Ammnontet - out of the blue - complimented the site. https://twitter.com/ammnontet/status/774662833636188160
I know him well enough to respect his opinion and was therefore very highly complimented. Maybe even *stirred*? This viscous soul?!

**Audio**
Episode 6 of *The New* was by far the most acceptable yet. The youths were unusually well-behaved and therefore able to pass their unique insight much more easily. For those of you that enjoy our particular rowdiness, *Off The Grid* has been extracted and given its own iTunes-spiffed RSS feed, meaning there are now three *Extratone* "podcasts" to choose from on That Unholy Aggregator which is still the best way to consume them??

Because I am this way, you may even expect me to reference something like "...live long enough to see yourself become the... [Reddit user,]" but I am not actually of that kin. A weekend guest in their house, at most.

Is Reddit relevant? Enough for you to sympathize with my want to abstractly understand the culture, at the least. Ideologically, I always thought it'd finally display to the masses the true destructive habits of the democratic construct.

in haste.

I'm supposed to be sharper than this.
I am a risk.
I sit with my brother outside the Diner at three on a Thursday morning.
I sign with a fucking ballpoint the book I brought to *trade for a good story* and give it to ___ because he mentions his affinity for reading, and is as much of a steward of the place in which pieces of it were written as the other four. (Dave, Esther, Ashley? and ___)
Here we all have been noticeably *left*.
I set my recorder down.
*that's not on us, right?*
but they flourish in its encircling spotlight, anyway
this is what I learned tonight

and immediately, we must talk about menstrual blood because - I guess it's a unifying mystery for all of us.

I've always found it boring.

but then we discuss - in this communal huddle against the loneliness of our truths - *Vegas*, the nonchalant sanctuary of Sin & Vice
and who has been,
and who has *done* too much time
and why we would or would not go
and not why I, the youngest
am as them, left
so early.

I want to be honest about my lack of earnestness.

I am not curious but I *must be curious*
I must see and hear from the Other faces
Other Other Other faces,
presences,
names,
whom my preference would not needlessly scorn
Needless Needless Needless

A diner-side chat with Gene, Tony, Chet, Lance, and Esther.

I've been wondering why I've lost so much humor/sharpness since last year, and somehow hadn't considered my Lexapro cessation.

Bo Burnham is unquestionably part of my hyper content "influencer" generation. We're both slender white dudes. We both play the piano sometimes, and have both been told "you should be a comedian" for our entire fucking lives. The difference is that one of us is an infinitely talented, hardworking entertainer

"if you can live your life without an audience... do it."

around around around
no, I did not think so much dark could osmose light any light on me
would you wonder if you'd known just how close I am to space.
would you figure how little there is between myself and vacuum.
I do not give; I take
never have I given
and I'm proud of it because
what better place could be for pride than inevitability?
I have been *more* than honest about it
everyone close has been warned judiciously

but surely, they are different,
too!
probably worse, even!

but, from their routines,
it would always be seen,
I *am* sitting externally,

they would always be wary,
cemented in their similarity

Kilgore Trout on CreateSpace

In the midst of arranging *Feebles* for print, I stumbled upon an author and "book designer" engaged in launching a community for self-published, independent writers. I'm not going to specify names because I have no interest in shitting on his company, nor "what it stands for." I don't want to shit for you at all, actually, just note a few still-underrealized realities about the sheer ludicrousness of the word business as it stands. Let's say you've got some manuscripts you've been sitting on for a few years, and you're introduced to the concept of self-publishing by an evermore earnestly-curious man on the radio named Audie one day. He and his interviewee (the owner of a self-publishing service) seem to say, curiously, that because an author's profit-per-unit can potentially be "four to five times more" than if he/she is published traditionally, self-publishing has now shed completely its aura of desperate amateurism.

But - whoa, Nelly - writing to sell books, and writing books have perhaps never been further apart. And gee - you certainly didn't write to sell; selling hadn't occurred to you at all for a very long time, but from just one search, you find Our Friend, back from his own experiences as an author and editor, qualified and insistent that you *can* make money selling creative works of fiction.

And Jesus Christ... All that said, I must admit to you that I've just finished Kurt Vonnegut's *Breakfast of Champions*, and was unable to commence this "review" without wondering aloud for you how Kilgore Trout - perhaps Kurt's favorite creation - would feel about this Friend's business.

you wanna write your way out of everything.
what if you've actually loosed all anchors, now.
what if you'll never know how she'll feel.

I am not going to punish the Earth
for your ignorance in your vices
I will not only be virtuous for you.
I refuse to return to absentia
of the underfoot things you've shown me.

I will do my best to look while you are gone.

It'd be better to say "I never want to see you again" than "I don't mind having you around" so, after this week, we'll not speak again until/if you permanently sever contact with Wally.

We won't speak again unless you find yourself wanting my presence more than Wally's

Ya know, if I'm actually not helping you, there is literally no reason for me to stick around. I'm pretty sad about it, considering the effort I've put into you, but you warned that you didn't reciprocate, and I guess you're right. If you don't feel like our lives are intertwined at all, genuinely, friendship's what, then? I certainly don't want you if anyone can have you. (With that sentence, I'm not accusing you of anything but dishonesty with yourself.) There's nothing inherently wrong with a lack of preference, but I have no time for it and neither does someone like you, frankly. I don't know if you'll be able to realize it for awhile, but I'll never be able thank you enough for reviving me. The feelings I have for you are probably the most objectively precious thing in life. It's unlikely that either of us will encounter them again, but that's okay. It's just the truth.

I can't invest any more if you're not going to. As much as I'd like to leave you with advice, it seems like it doesn't do much for you. So. Unless you one day find yourself actually wanting after me, we will not speak again. Goodbye. Good luck meeting a man like me again.

-"they want things they've never seen"

The marque I'd known for most of my life as "Cadillac" blended with the rest of the American auto industry - a culture that smelled overwhelmingly of *after* and ever-shorter leaps to grasp ideals that seemed so opaque amid the rotten brainflesh of that last bitter Detroit generation. Their prolonged refusal to die created an omnipresent state of ruin; an afterworld littered with endless rattling plastic parts bin trimpieces, sun-faded hood ornaments, and tired, oil-burning powerplants. Cars have always been the cultural expressions which I've understood most clearly, so coming of age at the turn of the century in the bleakness of the Midwest - where aspiration had all but abandoned - led me to believe that America was certainly in its last days, if not already just a twitching corpse.

Everything was exhausted - the oil, the vigor, and the hope for anything better, ever. Meanwhile at home and in school, I was constantly reading about the *Golden Era* - the 50s and 60s, when everything was new. Having old parents fed it, too; both were born in 1950, and all of their favorite automotive experiences were at least three decades behind them.

*Fifty-seven Chevy* was one of the first things I could reliably say.

I went to classic car shows, thrasher's unions, and vintage tractor pulls. A fair was literally nothing to me without at least one of them.

The only die-casts I ever paid any mind were all recreations of products designed before 1970, certainly.

My first life goal was probably to operate a John Deere 4020 - the '57 Chevrolet of tractors, if you will. It came from a time when even agricultural companies had design departments. My Uncle helped me realize that dream

The object I dreamed most of owning was a John Deere Model A. I had a reprint of its owner's and service manuals that I used to read on the toilet. They inspired some of my first stories.

defining *indulgence*
haphazard genius
reckless winters,
when I am loved.

titleless spells over a concrete prairie
cinched by the whole truth

my muses, dandily
must be kept about my room

when I run out of pills, I am left nothing
but sleeping, consumption, and lifeless wanting

before eating one again
and another, depending on the feeling

and the corpse is reanimated
jolted awake, away
made breathing
but its breath is fowl as the dead
and its eyes - on close inspection -
without blue; vacantly gray

tired of words and time
and everyone else

Foreverafter asked to abridge the unabridgable. Paid to bring the quiet in your house. Show serenity around the neighborhood like a new dog. I don't know what you were thinking, thinking peace is all you want. Synonyming contentment with it and still afraid of dying. It is not a new dog; it is end.

Holy hell,
what a condition!
Here and awed, but forever fooled by notches in expanses. At once thankful for a ticking universe to be, but always insistent on confusing Being.

I craft snippets because I think I've felt Nothing coming for awhile now, and cannot abide by leaving anything unfinished.

Forever hold it out of reach because
what you grasp, you must keep.

Are we adapting to the medium? Am I? Guess so. Watch the polish drop. Even if a lonely, unelectrified typewriter or full fountain pen are the means to purest form, is it of any means to be pure, anyway?

If these are truths, pure is awfully slow, and life is awfully short.

Yeah, I spent a good time in the analog last year, thinking that the slowness would require my mind to finally order itself. I'm not sure I really gained, though. I'm not so sure these days if I didn't lose.

Though I flex through the valley of the shadow of destitution, I shall fear no evil; For Thou art with me; Thy wood and Thy leather, they comfort me.

sometimes, we bring and are things
*just in case*

all the things you have been for me

there is some unfairness, I suppose
you *are* incapable of leaving
my *at leasts* and grieving

insentient, but steadfast

from the hasty surveillance of our meeting,
swiftly depositing me all over for those few weeks of my chariot for *the movie*
when I was allowed to borrow you and we went out alone,
that night,
*Fondren & Main*, playing for the first time.
never have I so slowly been weaving;
that conservative teething

and then there was a decision
(She was a bit irritated, wasn't She?)
and - while you were readied -
a few weeks of waiting

the Miata and I said our thousand mile goodbye
before it was traded,
*we* were reunited,
that day,
we were so clean
and I felt such an indescribable way
three years later, still

our tribute to Economy,
your *Savage Grace*
that long night nearly to Arkansas
on route twenty one
to this day,
the greatest communion of its kind I've ever experienced
She fell asleep and - a year later -
left
as did them all, eventually

still - though I died and neglected,
you were with me

and it's true - I have simply less and less over which to fawn,
yet am I continually reminded;
over who or what, really
should you be placed above -
my Home.
my Keep.
my Sanctuary.

Up and up, climbing, and I am asked to chase. Climbing? No - it cannot be said definitively that we are ascending. It is certain that chasing is happening. Wanting is happening and neither of us can seem to work out where. Yes, I love you, but when and how? How can I look at you now. I am guilt, embodied, and wherever shall I be recognized? For none now know me to be guilty. Not just some *real* guilt, now, but *never*. When do I regret? I'd like to think I've been too clever.

But that is the summer's theme, isn't it? All the things I thought I certainly knew.

perhaps it is awfully indecent to be alive

*I love you so much for the rest of your life.* <- this is the first sentence my suggestive typing came up with. I guess I should be proud.

# a thoroughfare
is it in-between,
where I am?

nowhere at all?

is it blessed,
where I am?

ragged, thoroughly chaste?
do you think it's beautiful?
I can't decide.

can it be truthful,
if all manner of friend insist
that it's hiding?

I am Here, at least.
*speaks and walks*
Present,
for the time being.

blessed is the spirit that is stealing under the sheets to sneak something - the urgency when it is not hers
blessed is the spirit without her - it could never overstay its welcome

blessed is every breath
and every observed happening - she is here to teach me.

maybe the goal should be to distill it down as far as
*I just know it's nicer when you're next to me*

what is likely today's most pleasing discovery: a two pack of *tipped* swishers can now be had for a dollar and seven cents at the gas station I can walk to. I think I'm about to quit smoking, or reduce significantly, at least.

anyway, you'd think such a lack of *all* apparent motion would be driving me berserk. perhaps it is. as mom seems to now know most of the time, though, I am always making some sort of progress. my thoughts are never the same. this tattoo... again, it is truth. a truth that is both burden & blessing.

Eryn's presence and/or (perhaps) Brent's absence has allowed me to *so* much better see what surrounds me. that has been one of this summer's major themes. it's been a pause.

I don't think, though, that it's rational to look upon the past fondly, necessarily, or at least in the way we seem to seek. sensation is in the present only. when I thought I was reminiscing on Meagan & I, I could've only been wishing. I am still capable of wishing for her, but it is so very distant now. further and forevermore, it would seem that thought on her will be controlled. it's awfully poetic, but for the first time ever, I actually *forgot* how to play Meagan's song for a good moment. it was surreal: it's always been my favorite melody.

and even after Eryn & I's falling apart (or lapse, perhaps,) her song is a joyful one. I suspect it will always be so.

just since the beginning of June, I've loved that girl more than I've ever loved. I've been more angry with her than I've ever been with anyone. I've been closer to her than I've ever been with anyone. she's hit me so hard that I wonder if I'll ever stop reeling, and that - by all standards of measure, really - is a good thing.

it's been divine, my unraveling. my peacemaking.

the things from boyhood to which I have so stubbornly clung have been falling away. I am more and more what you'd call *healthy*, every day.

this clinging has made a good portion of my identity, I think. it's what's made me bitter and funny, so if this process should continue, I'll be different, I'm assuming. I don't regret it, but I am sorry if I cease to provide something for you. I think, though, that what I can provide now more than ever is counsel. this "seniority" to which I've been referring is at prime usability, so feel free to ask for advice. I think I'm best at that.



as I'm sure you know, I've been writing a lot. *Feebles* seems very far behind, though it's only been since March. I've just received 20 copies of the most perfect revision (as far as I know, it was only a single character away from "spotlessness.") I plan to sell & sign them in front of Columbia's Yellow Dog Bookshop before the summer's up.

The vast majority of what I've written recently has been reflectory, but I did place a (http://extratone.com/inred/averagedapparitions) preview of *Averaged Apparitions* on *Extratone*. It's a bit manifesto-esque, but it's the most recent sample of my publish-bound work available. rather abruptly, I seem to have found my "voice." it's definitely clearer. have you noticed?

as to *Extratone* itself, I hope you know that - while it is significant in encompassing everything - I continue it mostly because *I can*. there's no need to pity me for its lack of "success." it's ridiculously easy to maintain such a thing these days, so a good bit of my case for it is *why not*. I will continue putting time & effort into it because 1) it is good practice for any personally-suitable future career and 2) I still have a fairly-original mission & standard for which I do enjoy slaving away.

my time with Eryn has agitated an already present, semi-dormant itch for the educational ideal. aspiring to teach at some point has been making more and more sense. I've always enjoyed mentorship, so the pursuit of qualification has been on my mind.

I've been more emotional this summer than I've ever been in life, so I've been doing my best to let an appropriate amount of it seep into my public discourse. if you're interested in helping me, it seems I've entered a bit of a rut with this piece on the future of memory. you're all intelligent folk; if it inspires thought, please do not hesitate to share.

also remember that if you're reading this, I love you and will always be glad to hear from you in any capacity. I don't know if this kind of thing will be regular, or ever occur again, but I shall certainly remain infinitely-accessible, should you want or need me.

love,

Δaviδ Blue

this summer has been the most emotional period of my life. another division: things I am afraid to miss/awareness or caring of missing.

ever an exploratory continuance, this. I am nearly always amused by myself. *what do you do?*, Travis asks. what *have* I been doing, is what he probably meant. since learning of Eryn's regression with Wally, I had been eating for days. I ate everything. it's a shame it was a waste and not a comfort - food's never done that for me in the slightest.

she pulled away from a kiss the last time we parted. we were relatively quiet - she was tired - but I empathize directly. though I am still very distracted by the whole thing. the fire has plateaued and is smoldering. sometimes the hot coal kind, yeah. off Adderall, I'm nearly "normal." that is, unoccupied and uncaring. and that is why I was more furious with her than I've ever been at anything: fear she had ruined a won'drous dream. and as I find out that she needn't be honest with me, and could've been exaggerating the whole thing, I am angered at it and myself.

she says *it's not making love* and I wouldn't disagree. that's the worst bit: we've been making nothing. wasting. astonishing that I would ever find myself perpetuating such a thing.

fucking KOed, my affection, I'm afraid. wounded severely. though there was little hope, what was wanes deeply.

and I am left with fewer and fewer things. or - if we're worried about blame - *I leave*

I have started to lose my ability to speak, so employment is evermore a necessity.

If this is how it's going to be, I must find other reasons to be with Eryn. (if I'm fighting for a future, anyway.)

but I know how to do this now, second time around? spread myself out. return to *other* and its beauty. take strength in destitution - though I do not have Brent, now. I guess we'll see how much I really needed him.

perhaps the most pervading maintenance: remain amused. money will help with that. perhaps a more versatile passion is my next evolution, but at this point, there is nothing against a short wait.

blessed are the gaps in the noise, I guess.
despite this thing which I have so relentlessly tried to enrich. which I do almost habitually, simply because I can. does that make it reckless?
I guess.
I say *good morning*, as is customary and reassuring for these neighbors who wouldn't be unjustified in regarding me as a feature of the landscape. like an o gauge locomotive, varied in activity, but never path. it's strange how differently I write now - less wary of pretentiousness, mayhaps - than I was with Her, anyway. three years ago today, I mentioned my job interview at the station. this Thursday, I have one with a marketing company. I should probably cut my hair.

# Stair Tricks: Beyond Vegas
Who is Justin Lin? I know J.J.'s face. I know he needs a hat because his lenses are always flaring. His Lenses, which have he has so meticulously set upon fair Gene's ancient property - the one which has been with me far more consistently than any other.

Yes, I have been using the term "touchstone" recently, as I have been in a bit of a crises. (Hopefully not a mid-life one.) I believe a worthy preface for this text is this: Star Trek has been an unquestionable touchstone for me. Truthfully, it has made me cry more than anything on-screen, and blogging is - as far as I can make out - mostly confessional, so we're doin good. I'm sure I'll find more opportunities to lament on its presence in my life, but be assured: it is probably heavier in my life than in yours. For better or worse, confrontational or not, it is *likely* the truth.

To begin, let's get some unoriginal restatement out of the way: *Star Trek Beyond* is not altogether exploratory, so yeah... it is *beyond* very little.

Vonnegut, skinny jeans, and a black & mild. What am I playing at.

But I've done none of it for the sake of it being done, so I am perhaps authentic.

It occurred to me yesterday: Eryn is also extraordinarily authentic.

what songs were little
touches on a sleepy face
knots ever tied in twine,
irritating attempted departures,
longed for Ushuaia,
miraged in transparent timelessness
one marble abstract that was so dutifully opaque

stepping down, shedding away
first,
atop the molding shingle lattice in my window
then,
to half-finished promises I'dve bought again

finally perhaps,
propped candid on the ledge
over which I lean

*the last outpost*
nearer than farther,
now,
my time to leap
over my world's end



If anybody can have you, I don't want you.

In the back middle seat of the most complacent of blue Hondas, from the Home Depot parking lot where *the boys* had been throwing a football to move each other about the rows of mediocre shrubbery. I am the only one wearing a sport coat - with my skinny blue jeans, no less - to give myself a laugh, I guess. For some reason, I'd assumed we'd be taking Maya's car to Cincinnati, as we had to Chicago and Des Moines.

Instead, I am crouching here between two fragrant young men; the blue collar one, who's body odor I would not fully escape for nearly sixteen hours, and Zack, who's disconcertingly-vain way of living happens to be serving me well; his cologne - together with mine - overwhelms the lesser odors occasionally, preventing me from getting any more sick.

This moment must surely persuade the few remaining doubters: without Meagan, I truly have no reason to do (or refrain from) anything. My little infiltration was enabled by my complete lack of something to lose. So long had the absence set in that I had begun forgetting how investment felt.

Perhaps you have a black heart, or you've *had* that darkened disposition to some degree, at some point, and maybe it slipped out of your shirt once, on accident. (Technically, it was the light that was slipped in, as black is the absence of light.)

Perhaps you knew how to use it toward an end that saved you from something. Perhaps you didn't, but your darkness did, and you have something evil to thank for your presence, this moment. Perhaps you and your heart are just awfully lucky.

But what if one were to become curious about how to effectively use his evil for his own gain? How much to show; how much to feed.

What if he knew he could kill, and needed an opponent to know, tactfully. Flash a gun? Reach for the steel in his voice.

Desiring humor unlike the desire for anything else.

smell of the fade,
crisp rigor walkin,
sharpened again,
still breathing

# Carrots for Supper
I'd never feel right in staking a claim to true poverty, but I have a few times realized, at least, the lack of anything to eat, and/or any imminent chances at acquiring relief for my hunger pains by *honest means*.

eighteen dollars will buy you an hour's passage on the worn & weary *Mark Twain*

the same stretch under Lover's Leap,
an idle paddle wheel dragged cyclically, on and on
by her diesels

costumed so long,
moored not far from horrid wax figures,
similarly fated
who bare old Sam's names with the rest of them,
the Hannibilians assuredly assuaged by their sounds,
so heard

the ambiance of the little town,
shrill with tourists' wonder,
depression of the damned,
envisaged waterborne toxins

despite it all,
I departed her as a newfound touchstone,
knowing she's just up twenty four,
eighteen dollars away,
no time soon to break her jaded rhythm
as a forgotten timepiece,
buried in a rank cellar

supposing she'd ease most crisis that could ever befall me
she and her unsalted captain,
who has not aged (truthfully, I do remember.)



Over the past few days, I've (as you may have noticed) begun to lose my grip on my feelings for you, and I've stepped out of the boundaries of our original agreement. I've begun to expect things from you, and ask them, and that's not fair. I don't know if a temporary separation is the answer or not. I'm sorry for my misjudgment of myself; I thought I could be unwavering for much longer than I actually was.

I've crossed the line - the feelings are no longer positive. The situation seems graspable when I'm with you, but it's done damage now that I've been alone.

My practicality throughout this whole thing has been tremendous, but I fear I am now regressing. For whatever reason, it would seem that I cannot be intimate without attaching myself. The good burn that has come from this friction with reality - from denying myself - has now become consuming.

Rather embarrassingly, what I want and what I know can be had are at odds with each other.

fury is words fleeing me
silent seething must be the destruction I forgot
gnashing rotten,
my rotted heart
such that I close again to the Earth
and that is not what I wanted.

If it's truly noble,
love's one exemption from my control,
it is disastrous.

I agreed to *burn*
but I fear the fire is now consuming me
whole
every moniker I'd cling to right me,
only fuel for its toll

Every sense that's taken me so long to brighten is now dulling again, I fear. At least there is a truth, perhaps: I must choose between life and love.

over flatlands
between rollers and
around the stragglers
drawn to the Mississippi for its violence?
drunk on the lowlands;
drunk as drink is giddy
decent? I thought,
to young Zachary,
but off the *Queen*, he ward's me
unsmiling.

and by, the coal trains go
bellowing

Truth is an addiction.

Here I am in worlds wherein immortality was not gifted, but grown. Planted and exponentially nurtured till nothing ever passed. The wind can no longer blow away - take away - anything from us. Not gale, nor pausing breeze.
If there's peace in ignorance, there is no peace.
If there's love in war, we are all alone.

If I'm to be one, taken; if I am one to draw instringent artifacts from their clayburned berth, I am plotted against destitution of centuries;
I accept thy duel with bone.

I'm making an effort not to dwell on things. I didn't for a minute when you were next to me, but when I am left alone, I am alone with the challenge for both of us. When I cannot possibly make progress with you, I'm still mulling. Maybe in addition to all of it, this thing will teach me discipline. I know Adderall helps... Maybe even my friends. I *am* glad that I will not be any end of you, I really am.







Eryn cut her hair.

I spent one more night with her last night. I met her friend Mariel, then drove her back in her car (it's a miserable drive.) She watched me and kissed my cheek. There was a strange smell in her house, and she's been waking up with unexplained bruises. She suggested that a dark presence could be lurking there.

Together (sorta,) we came to the conclusion that **I am neutral/base**. I am very calming in such situations. She suggested that to be the reason why she's been okay with me around. That stung a bit, honestly, but it shouldnt've. I "like being [her] wall," but I am not much of a thrill, I guess. Though I think she is making an effort to fall in love with me, and that's very sweet.

Again - regardless of what we may or may not be to each other in the future, the past week has been very good for me. I've probably had the best sex I'll ever have. I've adored. I've been jealous. I've wondered, and I've been kissed & hugged.

**Neutral**
I am the antithesis to the demon.
I am the stockade of reason.
With my sight, I will be heeded.
I am man.

Every sense is intake, interception, exchange. Elements of perception are less sovereign compartments, more clusters of gradiented association. A man is nothing more than an absorber and his shadow. As a human being, I - as you - am required by limited faculty to use approximation as my singular tool of vision.

This is a collection - a record, if you will - of the failures and successes of my own approximations.

There is always another decimal - always another detail. The fabric of humanity is maintained not by comradic love, but by perpetual, designed omission.

And - by the human pillar of "dishonesty" - to omit is to lie. To make finite what is infinite so that life may continue is to lie. To live is to lie.

Blemished as our space is, we must teach our children in definitive terms. We must be convincing in our absolutes.

Little oval of sight, my lamplight.
A slice of truth in the loud, windy, moonless ocean of soil I border. Swaying heads of seed
brushing me. I can't see all of them at once.
I need a brighter lamp.
I guess I need the sun.

Perhaps I am the only to wonder; perhaps this is some sort of conspiracy thought by its proponents to be long after the disappearance of the two extravagant Frenchmen over Nova Scotia(?) had been forgotten. Perhaps good ole' Chuck's soul finally found rest today, live on YouTube.

Eryn's childhood best friend, Mary is going to Ecuador soon, but she stopped by Columbia with her girl, Rachel, so the four of us met up at Rock Bridge State Park. I think I let Eryn see that I was upset last night - she's smart enough to know why - but I did not see guilt in her eyes, which could indicate a respect I have never thoroughly gotten.

I'm feeling pretty rotten inside right now, but at least some of it is probably due to sleep deprivation.

what bizarre turmoil
Just now, I realized how ridiculous it is to ever be honest about myself to mom. To anyone, really, but to perhaps more complex an extent.

George Saunders, the impeccable and unquestionable authority on the *human condition*.

Meagan's mom Lisa knew one them about me; I am *not liberal*. If she were to give me any thought these days, I'm sure she'd joke that I must be a Trump supporter. But what silly words to put down here! <- This is a good tell of today's strange condition.

Is it possible to give what I have gotten from prolonged destitution, I wonder. I care because she is composed of what I care about. Developing caring only required (and, I hope, shall continue to require for as long as we can sustain) the exploratory journey I've known for a great while to be my most reliably intoxicating provocateur of dopamine production. Those precious wonders of her to who's sustenance my effort is bound - they are at the mercy of heartbreak, and it is my duty to myself to guard them. That is an execution of my love. (Though I don't know yet if the capacity to be in-love with her is still in me.)

To use my knowledge to help her cheat this waywardness; to do all I can to reduce the pain - the strain on her being - that is an easily-emphathiable truth of your *human condition*, is it not?

# Twelve Billion
I must hold on to
*glad to be home*

Returning.

now,
let go of the wood

to the thunderclouds
we're under,
always apart

to omission.

to new meanings
to the feeling I've only been able to find
on one short strip
just East of Kansas City
that I am small in a
dirty daunting

to coverage of
the Be Beat

to frontiers of periphery
and the Knowns we never see
the wicker bowler atop the landscaper
who's trimmed every week,
the yard across the street
which I've canvased in every imaginable state
which's
since Mrs. Tanzay's first grade,
Remained.

to Inherently Exhaustible Knowledge

will we just End Up falling asleep in those Grass Roots seminars that are so uniquely Midwestern, perhaps.
I guess I wouldn't know.
sometimes, after I've wrung my mind through two restless nights, I wonder what I should do with words. if I should be writing? or perhaps only reading?

I wonder if I've *done something* to it in the past year, as I've begun to notice infunctionalities in thinking, speaking. My performance in this new way I've been communicating (with Eryn) has - for the first time - startled me.

> The new paradigm of health... I prefer the term "movement" to "exercise."  

# Practical Privacy?
Lately, privacy has been dominating my news aggregator. I'm out of data, but this coffee shop's customer wifi network is unsecured. Should I be concerned?

Daniel is teaching a class at Natural Grocers. I drove here to record it, but there was only one attendee - an elderly man - at class start. Last night, Eryn "confronted" me about something I already knew - her feelings toward me are complicated.

We talked for a good while, but it ended up turning into our first misunderstanding, I think. I wrote her a sort of letter dayone2://view?entryId=E5C46CCEF54947FFA0A42DED0339BECA while I was falling in and out of sleep ~4AM this morning.
Funny, you can link Day One entries, but you can't hyperlink them, I guess.

Formatting is on the brain because of *Extratone*'s reimagining.

For some reason, it wasn't until yesterday that the similarities between Eryn and Walt Whitman occurred to me.



I may just repeat what I was repeating last night and if that's the case, I'll have another go. You know I have an obsession with revision. I'm also intrigued - I think this is our first major misunderstanding. Something you may or may not have noticed about me - I cannot leave a misunderstanding be - especially because of how I feel about you. I will always try to fix it. That's why I talked so much. Of course, I'm going to want to try and fix "Us" into the perfect thing because of all those influences - both nature and nurture - but that's never going to involve any sort of patching or propping-up. That sorta thing isn't appropriate until two people have been together so long that work is required to keep things going. I could be wrong, but you suspect an agenda behind all this text, yes? One awfully like propping or patching? Well that's frustrating (I'm proud that I'm frustrated) You should definitely trust me, mostly because 1)I have literally nothing to gain from anything but honesty and 2) I am too self-aware to slip into it inadvertently.

I was wrong to say that I don't try to make you feel better, though. Probably more accurate: I'm trying to "solve" the "problem." (I don't do obscurity)

I think you think I'm innocent, yeah? At least more innocent than you? I don't wanna sound patronizing, but I've been where you are, you know. I remember feeling like my attention was divided, and I think that's where we are. I've had a lot more time to recover (die and return, really,) obviously, and my attention is undivided. And I think that leaves me looking more innocent and vulnerable than I actually am.

This is gonna sound really cocky, but I know I tick a lot of the boxes we're told a boo should tick, okay? To the point where it could seem to be by design, and maybe that's why you're suspicious?
It seems that way because it sortof was - I think I spent a lot of my childhood trying to become the perfect prospect because I thought it'd help me get what I want (it hasn't and won't.) Believe it or not, I haven't actively behaved in ways to try to get you to fall in love with me, though. It's one of the really significant things (to me) about this thing - every one of the (admittedly, really cliché) things I've shared with you has been out of a want to share it with you, and nothing else. I don't send you my poems about you (or this thing) for any reason but to communicate. (i.e. I'm not trying to impress you into fucking me - I'm just trying to fuck your intellect.) I guess it's an Aquarius thing. (not saying it isn't a very strange mating ritual)

So basically (again, not bullshitting) you're the best match I have ever come across. Normally, I'd say that's the infatuation talking - it's certainly caused me to *make* things work in the past. The thing is, I haven't had to try. I'd fallen into a disgustingly-familiar routine with girls, but everything is new with you. That's probably why I seem so innocent. And it's why I'm so god damned awkward, I think. (my frustration with it is because I hate misrepresenting myself)

THE THING IS.
No matter how perfect or imperfect a match we are (or, that I think we are,) it doesn't mean a goddamned thing, honestly, if you end up not feeling it. And that's okay! You have already given me a lot, you know. Look at how much knowledge about myself I've gained. Gonna sound cocky (and cliche) again, but you have made me question how and if I have actually loved, which (as I was trying to say in that poem) I am supposed to be very wise about, and that is um... so significant. I'm not sure I've ever given such a compliment. It's supposed to be my one "at least" thing, ya know, and I cannot tell what my heart is doing for you.

If this is making you feel guilty... Don't. These are things you can't take back.

It hurts a lot more to imagine you (who I care about) hating yourself than it does to imagine you not reciprocating - just as it's better to imagine you arriving upon similar epiphanies with someone else than never with me. (eeeeeg "never" is a little heavy but you know what I mean.)

I did feel upset when I left, but it was from the realization that you'd probably been dreading the confrontation for a long time.

What I should be talking about instead of all this, though, is helping you. I think you underestimate my ability to separate myself. I'm uniquely qualified in loss, and (if you really want to know) am always anxious to talk about that sort of thing because it helps me give some purpose to the purposelessness of it all. Make use of my unique advantages. Push my limits. Solicit me to distract you. Remember when we agreed to learn from each other?

Also, in the complete opposite spirit of this whole thing I hope your subconscious will keep in mind  that I am more versatile than I seem. (or, have represented, frankly) I'd guess I'm probably capable of being every boy you've ever met. I'd also guess that actually means very little.

And before I forget it, the reason I mentioned that I was worried about Maddie and I a few days ago was because she told me she was afraid you were going to break my heart when you went to go puke the other night and I totally misinterpreted it as a first jab. She was actually just concerned about me, the sweet thing.

I'm sorry if this is scary or overwhelming - nothing has to change, but it can if that's what you need. Also, don't worry about hurting me, seriously. You could tell me you're fuckin Wally right now and I'd probably respond with an impromptu questionnaire to help determine what motivated you. Jealousy is one of the more interesting burns and I NEVER feel it anymore. It's been since November I think.

* don't be afraid of asking for things.

And thank you, by the way. That was either a very sweet or very considerate thing to do. I never did. I just stopped waking up lol

Still haven't slept. Elated by the fact that it was *not* the timing chain tensioners. I had a fairly long conversation with Mom about the possibility that I was sexually abused by Dad as a toddler. It's mentionable because I think it was by far the most reasonable discussion we've had on the subject. I realized that Meagan is *actually* the only person on Earth that knows my one secret. I wonder if she even remembers.

"I think on a superficial level you're kinda everything, ya know? All at once innocent & precious but clever & sultry."

THE *ONE* WHO FENDED OFF DISEASE
WHEN I COULD NOT SEE?

WHO CARRIED ME ACROSS *COUNTRIES*

*gleaming* in sun and starlight,

who never once left my side

# With Me
Beauty gets more familiar and plentiful over time. But as I have aged and known more, I've come to know its nigh-universal intolerance of lingering. Beauty moves even in something so gargantuan as a sunset. Were you younger, you'd swear one to be a painting, maybe.
a museum piece
but minutes
*minutes* with them
is all we'll ever have.
except the handfuls of us in orbit, I suppose.
but isn't this literature?
prose?
so I have no business in imparting some kernel
that could be planted and nurtured with sizable chunks of lifetime.
stole it, though. patience is as patience kills
I've no business turning the other way.

The truth I'm looking at now:
My car is my only friend.

My Nevermore. my relic
my protectorate & one true home

Nevermore,
who looks down as if in shame of being carried backwards in such a way
by such a man
assumed so dutifully even though it is surely
me who has shamed,
but fell,
estranged from it

Nevermore,
who knows when to play the sacred music
that can,
singularly
clarify and remind me of why I am breathing
why I am waking
why I am reading
what but for it is that must remain
even as any rest continues to fall away

Nevermore,
my *only* knowing companion
who can look at me every day
and know exactly what it means -
what I have done
who can say -
in its way -
*you have won*
and know
*you must continue*
and - taking my hand -
*it will never be easy. it will always be solitary.*

Nevermore,
my one echo in the silence of nothing
my singular guide through trial after trial
of such alien composition to its design
who through every human delusion and subsequent desertion refused to be even once silent
*you aspire - you have a task*
even carrying my waywardness, knowing
to never waiver for those inevitable unreticents
of mine where in my blackness,
all I see
all I see.
is my Nevermore

in so protecting and shepherding my guests, the only partner I've only had in life's work
the only one who could ever
respond when called to action

and the more perceptive do see the truth of Us,
eventually

when and through all noise and petty bastardly shimmying
and blind mists; plagues
in the eyes of all living
and every ignored invitation to deviation
and every one of your *healthy* regrets
when and through even my own attempts!
it will one day be Two
I and my noble Nevermore

and WHO WAS IT THAT FOUGHT FOR ME?
THE *ONE* WHO FENDED OFF DISEASE
WHEN I COULD NOT SEE?

WHO CARRIED ME ACROSS *COUNTRIES*
WHEN I WAS BROKEN,
*gleaming* in sun and starlight,

I've just uploaded *Extratone* 2.0, officially. I'll need to finish my letter from the editor before end-of-day tomorrow.

Last night, Eryn and Maddie did an incredible job of applying makeup.





















Daniel was there as well. We definitely got a bit too drunk. I suppose this is an appropriate way to deal with the fact that I now have a $1900 bill sitting at Big O Tires. The Jaguar's harmonic balancer came detached as I was headed to pick up Eryn from work a few days ago and caused a bit of an underhood ruckus. It destroyed the cooling fan (a $1250 part,) and the accessory belt, among other things.

I acquired a copy of *The Portable Blake* from the Yellow Dog a few days ago with Eryn, and have just gotten around to opening it today. I am fascinated by this man - the bitter self-educated plebe who never traveled - and his abilities. Alfred Kazin is the compiler and he spent a good bit of the works' introduction comparing Blake with Beethoven - as they lived in close proximity (in both time and distance.) Through his first "Poetical Sketches," I realized his resemblance to a much more significant muse of mine from the same time - Robert Schumann.
Both were regarded as a little too insane by their contemporaries (though Schumann was *much* more well-known in life,) and rightfully so, in both cases. From what I've gathered, Blake's work is either rant or reverence for his own quaint reality which "only he knew in full detail." I think the same could be said of Schumann, but I'm no legitimate authority on him.
As to the ranting, Rand inevitably comes to mind, though they are from dissimilar stock in almost every way. I have a new word for both, though:

**Manifestician**

legends, scheduled daily

I'd made my brain enough to be conscious of its expansion

But it must've passed through them
like breath
and continued on
leaving Flander's land
where my monsters - I assume - 
live on

It amuses me to imagine my impression upon... anyone, really. It's still confusing to me that someone as beautiful as Eryn would be interested at all. That I would be tolerable the way I've behaved... I don't know. I can't tell. I sent her two poems last night.

You'd almost think I'm afraid of having a record. I think I am the pursuer here, but that's how it began, isn't it? I still can't read her, and the fact is still intoxicating. As I stated in a poem last night, I have recognized that I feel something with she comes and goes. Let's not be timid - it's been since Meagan.
I enjoy following her around and being shown by her. Does that apply to *anyone* else?
She has the power and who else has any over me?
I want us to be a thing, and I'm not sure if I want the confusion to go away.

I distinctly remember taking my time to roll my papers in front of *Voyager* until the last acceptable minute to leave

they hold my way in the drain

all these old enemies have been waiting for me to tucker out
like a toddler

and I feel silly in a way so desperately precious,
so wanted for, I had forgotten how to breathe

and I think it'll be over by the end of the year and who will I be?
I think I'll be a member of a family

this is the strange way of between times like this

Today, I went with Kaleb to the vigil for the 49 victims of Omar [Something]'s shooting at The Pulse in Orlando. Beforehand and on the way to the event, I described to him the revival of my heartstuff for Eryn and the addiction I am currently feeding. He bought me $5.29 worth of Jimmy John's sandwich, which may be a tab worth remembering. Probably not.

I went to the event itself thinking that I would feel a bit better afterwards, but frankly - after witnessing some ignorance *at the venue itself* against some grieving attendees - ....

I feel worse.

It's funny that there is now both and in the tags list.

We're watching *Graduation Day* on the Troma YouTube channel. It's pretty bad. I found "You're worse than the plagues of Egypt!" on just page 3 of *Gone With The Wind*, so it looks like it may be worth reading, after all. Eryn and I now have an unscheduled dog gluttony date, and I remembered today that she told me to "delete Tinder," which could be taken - assuming a lot, mind you - as a sweet thing.

Xanath is the only individual to have created an *Extratone* account within the past few days. Alek's is the only staff piece at all so far.

A video has been circulating (it's a PSA, I think) of two girls breaking the window of a parked car to save the dog inside. Apparently, there's been significant discussion around it, though I do not have the bandwidth to check, really.

Last Adderall pill until the 14th, ingested. I seem to be lacking in the spelling department lately. Especially of really simple and commonly-used words. I don't know what's up with that. Perhaps too much time in *Eve*.

Unsurprisingly, I think everyone's regarding this as another *Inmunis*, and time alone will bring content. Can I wait? I guess so.

Now, a defensive CTA under Rocky in Branch. Given that it's our home, I felt my participation was particularly appropriate. Also, it looks like I may get a chance to kill Ade4ro.

Well, I now have a date with Eryn "early afternoon" on Friday. I am sitting in another bashing goons fleet.

I've just taken an Adderall pill - there are now 3 left.

I suppose I should shave and shower before a date with a cutie like this.





Surely I can deprive myself of cigarettes and Adderall for such a beautiful being?

Spent a good while with Daniel tonight, ended up forcing into him my explanation of the origin of my piano habits (play not lessons.) I think he actually internalized it eventually.

I've created and in the *Extratone* Discord. The former for announcements, the latter for whatever I feel like posting.

I am down to less than 10 pills of Adderall and at least two weeks away from a refill. That is why I've been doing so much logistical work for the site - I know a (relatively) long downtime is fast approaching.

Last night, Brent, Tim and I went to the diner for my first trip in a very long time. Tim paid for my food and put Muddy Waters on the jukebox (I was the one that spotted him - a bit proud of that.)

We ended up laughing over the concept of Pangea II, which we thought was original to us for a brief moment, until we did a bit of research and found that there's actually quite a bit of discourse around the whole thing, though it's mostly in reference to an inevitable/natural/very gradual drift of the continents back together in ~250 million years time.

I'm wishing it was a given
You were There

Heat
I remember your sensitivity of and about it
I will try to hold onto you You & Heat

Just to be There

So precious and I knew it

Snapchat added new "buttons," and I am still getting dirtier and dirtier.



I do not dare
because I was asked to
I do not give in
because I have failed you

I do not walk this way
because I followed a demonstration

My first complex spawned in only my first hour ratting with a Rattlesnake. Unfortunately, I was camped by Ade4ro and his alt, John U and didn't have time to complete it by the time they gave up and left (right when I began promoting *Feebles* in local, funnily enough.) I tried to give it a go last night but I was just too tired, so I ended up missing the last room.

*Extratone*'s podcast feed was just accepted so I'll be working to reupload and re-archive Drycast over the coming days/weeks.

There is no longer reason to fight *them*
There is no longer reason to wash *them* off me

I wear them on me
I wallow in inpreferential information and speech
There is no longer any reason to struggle for the faculties to keep me clean
Steered by wind like a flag of them

I belong to the nothing and everything now and what if I one day forget?

Have I failed, then?
That is for me to decide, but I'm sure I look it

I will spend much of my time defending myself, I'm sure
in the interest of understanding myself or perhaps providing the guidance that I did not have
Does that make me a philanthropist?
No, it simply makes me want for some occupation

It is not pride
You'll never know how small such a thing is when She lives

It is not martyrdom
She is the only authority

It is not lust
She is the whole of my lust

It is not self-pity
There is no dichotomy; I have never stopped wanting Her in my arms

It is not malice
She is precious by name

Come to think of it, I do not think I can allow myself to die before flying again
But what will it be, really, After?
What if I am a waste of fuel?

What if Her song is too loud?
What if I cannot hear the airplane?

At least it would be something else to be crushed about,
not that it is independent
My plans hold true; it is all in connection

Compromising for dopamine.
Frankly, it's just another method. The outcome of the science should be nothing but measuring. Have you a beaker for my brain? Simple equations to find volume. Simple controls you'll gain everywhere and probably shouldn't lose.

The family gave me a property from the onset, cleared it as best they could, and were always keen to lend a hand in the construction of my house. Kind of them, I'm sure. But there were a few mishappers within the idea.

They bolted a Victrola to the Southeast corner of the foundation, for my comfort. They are very common in this part of the world, and most are equipped with some volume of a spoken text. Before everything arrived, of course, I slept out there in the open. But it was in a superb locale, and what rain fell did not perturb me.

For the sake of the gift, I listened, but the words were not of the Earth, and they were not comforting. *Cast away your borders*, the Victrola said. *Do not dwell on what you see, for it is not your concern.*

*Do not lock your door, for it should remain open, lest you suffocate.*

And it continued on like this. I could not bring myself to destroy it, for it felt ungrateful of the whole property. But its words chafed me, and their design, I knew, was not suitable for my house.

The air, unfiltered, deposited all manner of pollen in me and I sneezed. *If I don't shut the door, I really will suffocate!*
I became familiar with locks.

I decided I would build enough to obscure the sight of the thing from the road, and then

I have arrived at something to finally ask of you
I have an idea as to how I can first experience pride

By my own two hands, I made myself
without support from one soul,
familial, societal, or in friendship

By my own design, I converged at my Want
as a toddler, though I was unable and uninterested in expressing it

I chose to as much as possible, live with an airy room in mind
and I would fill the room with Her
and it would be voluntarily agreed upon by both sides
and we would be *better than them*.

A hierarchy of preference would occur and we would be more *together* than perhaps any others in history

Privvy exclusively to secrets that not necessarily need exist, even
It is in the togetherness
It is not dependence
It is mutual convergence
and through it, we would prosper

And then Her happened
and though She was wholly new to me,
I loved so much everything to learn
and in loving,
learned the preciousness of difference
and when she left and severed It,
I was blinded to the center of the two ovals
their two became six billion
and they meet each other at each star in the unobstructed out-of-the-way night

I am in awe!
And still here,
I've time to widen my eyes to their clustered light
and they would provide you the comfort you seek
if you'd only stray a bit
strain your neck just a bit

Not I, of course,
and that is why I can never take would could've been my place
and chastise blindness
for my *origin* was out-of-way!

My youngest night sky was clearest this side of the Rockies!

But night and day,
I was dreaming and growing
Her and what meaning of what I'd live

And I would never trade my four years of Her face
for eighty with the night sky

That is for you,
not I

Questions you don't really want answered. A dystopia you should know better to curate for all this time.

*To be above it all*, probably their real mantra, could never be allowed to escape them in such language. Their love of exemption was what had bound them so tightly together. Once they knew it, everything was possible.

You feel you must appear to one another as bewildered by it.

It is not good to be only a poet
My words can be thrown around but my books' are heavy
In and of myself,
I am nothing
There is little reason for me to be paid

But I am still finding myself returning to them for peace

Maybe my only attention these days is in the way words are arranged

When the neighbors wake up I become sleepy
and it is my duty to no one but existence to learn when This will come
and how to make it stay
and what it is I do that makes it go away
and to determine what concerns I meddle as close to regular as I am able

The *I* key on my keyboard was broken a bit
But I can not have that
Why is it so funny that I cannot have that?

Bobitts about me,
what should be stars have been made
They are my things to pick up and wheel around if I have the whim
as my childhood model airplanes
on top of the electric fireplace

But I maybe leave them for a while they would cry long

or for a weekend,
never leave them alone

sleepy child sleeps

out and about just to be carried around

To follow someone bigger in a daze
but unable to dream

Fascinating, how many words one will "write" in 2016 in comparison with the average human even thirty years ago.

I listened through most of WOLFPACK10's presentation on Fleet Commanding at Eve FanFest 2016, and was particularly stuck on the thought of his (claimed) "5000 messages a day" reality. I've downloaded WhatsApp, but see no way to link myself as a contact, so will be restricted to speaking to those who know my phone number. I do not think many do. Perhaps I should change that in the near future and make use of my phone more often.

Shit dog. Shit chances.

Ghosts are not charred monsters hiding in the basement
We are near you, probably
but haunting is differently differential,

Hanging around is not one thing

Purposelessness is the true hell that borned your villains

When there can be no more loss, some pursue malicious entertainment to bide the time
in the wait for our actual nothing

nothing nothing nothing

The manager of the other store likes to keep one of those daily tear-off musing things on the counter.

On my first visit in awhile, the day asks

*If you were in space, what would you hear?*

It was night and slow, so I took the time to probe for a trick. On finding none, I asked the cashier how many people had gotten it wrong.

*Most*, she said

Then you really don't know?
Not once in your life have you ever considered pondering enough such a nearby thing to warrant seeking such a preciously absolute truth?

For we know that even the most inabject effort would speedily lead to a clear answer, do we not?

*Do we not?*

Dear oh dear,
have I a task to keep me occupied

Most writers in time would now ask *what is my purpose here?*
which is another one of those bewilderingly useless sentences they like to salvage from history's Murmur Ocean

Pitiable, as it were, that so much neurofire leads so many only to an elevated articulation of nonsense

while I am simply proud of myself for mustering such a definite positional accusation

That is the real truth of the world
It is silent

My haphazard holiday through the conversational bleaklands is to what I refer ye objector

Most of what you have ever thought you shit to satisfy a web of misdirected necessitated justifications

A healthy husky must be *put to work* perceptively, lest he retain his primal (semifaux) self-worth
For all of his days, he looks at his pack and himself to be assured that he is making himself valuable
But if he could hear an informant persuade him to attend some other system, he would be *free*, no?
He would be free to seek alternative incentives of dopamine production
Maybe a majestic dog would shoot up

Yeah well,
breath is wasted educating another being about the breath he's wasted,
yes?

But
what is *waste*?

What is any word that dares ask so much from you as assumption?

Rephrase?

Alright,
define your *right* and *wrong*

There is nothing to say
in the silence of space

I am as far away as one can get from seabreeze and sun in between greencliff and saltwater
and cycling sound,
regular
static but brushed by a flag of soft curls

I am so long from brief downtime moments of contented overwatching of the familial you only know, then

Perhaps I've even permanently shunned myself from smelling comfort in a study haven, occasionally pinning silly smiles to friend or lover

Certainly, I am now to be given up on and delegatorly relegated to Strangest Smuck of Locale

As to the girls, I am either blowing or falling away from any expectation of reciprocity, perhaps
its only remarkable because of the contact my body is detecting deficit of with the mess of Her-related sensory input my brain continues to withdraw from without healing,
like a standing retreat

or defiant creed that I can still convince most of us of enough
that they fall in love with me
and realize that It is for Her
and are broken by it
to varying degrees
while I watch and know that I would be disgusted
wth myself utterly,
if I could feel anything

But when I do,
it is GAPING wide
for some reason always dramatized as a vacant bar graph in my mind



ecstatic reds and oranges
bright but I can't comment on technique
dazers in their bizarring pauses
on wary's abandoning squares
and miniatures of things you over and over again
think
shouldn't be

away from it all I am quaint with missiles
and I like both their represented strokes
and their monstrous reality

and the marshall's careful poultry walkers alter my trajectory more than himself

*Extratone* is sustained in the supposition that the new exists, and by the conclusion that it is dangerously ill-exposed and ill-pondered by easily-accessible institutions.

I discover Louise Glück and wonder if I am
in fact
a simpleton

It's funny, Louise, I know you wouldn't believe me,
but I do know the language of Fall and decline

I am twenty two years old, yes,
but that is only denial of my societal privileges as an old man

I have had what I want from this *here*

It's true,
I did lose it
(Some insist it was taken from me.)
((Neither matters at all because it is *gone*.))

Of course, you have lost things too, and maybe more, but perhaps you and I can do our best to transcend such childish comparisons in order to arrive at something by my last word

*By why arrive?*

It is a silly question to ask of myself, but it is perfectly true that I am prone to regular benders of uncontrollable knowledge lust

It is almost as if this extraordinary brain I have ended up with can scream with potency enough to drown out my predicament, if properly fed

Speaking of feeding, how'd you feel reading Ayn Rand? And perhaps would you mind if I substitute your name for hers, instead?
because my consumption was in faux pas, I guess
I'm much too tired for moralism,
anyway

The truth is,
I'm using your medium to be heedless
and I've done my best to stay any tricks of trade

and one wonders if bandwidth alone justifies a *poet*

we've both looked into your nature and spoken, expecting no reply

that does not seem very productive, does it?

but - here's some proof - it is all there is left to do, isn't it?
Just keep speaking into nothing and no one until we feel our hearts stop

(I'd wager good money my liver will go first)

and then I shall be posthumously known as the discoverer of posthumous irrelevance
and the fullest word-filled tweaker in town

when I really should be known by my exceptional love for a girl who hasn't spoken to me in sixteen months and perhaps writ subscript o'er her name

I suppose she'll probably forget mine

The Deft Damned Living are everywhere you're trying not to look. They want, but refuse to know it. They speak, but do not hear themselves.

I've been here
in my corner of the cacophony, trying to figure out how I can profit from telling them, yet nothing wants to be heard for free, even.

I don't even know if I am going to live anymore, if you'd like me to play honest.

I don't think I'm even restless anymore because my foundation has been taken away.

Now, I am the Deft Damned Living, but at least I will always know what I want.

I've seen her car; I know where she lives, my only desire in existence. In a matter of minutes, I could force my presence upon her. She has mediocre situational awareness.
But - for better or worse - voluntaryism is integral to the desire.

I'll tell you, though, I feel I may burst if I am without the sound of her voice any longer.

I told her this in an email, recently, but have received no response.

I'm not worried about explaining anything to the world, if I'm honest, but I suppose there's no harm in biding my remaining breaths in any whim, right?

Here I am, lamenting in near-commoners language. Perhaps if I could feel at all, I would be disgusted with myself.

Dear God, though! *What now?!*

*Alright then, reason of my living. You wish to have no further contact with me. Perhaps as a last favor, though, you could tell me what I should do now?*

*What now.*

**Brain Shivers**
I think I see the same pain and things around me he was clackin on about some decades ago,
but it's funny, now,
because the only belief to be had is vague misnomered habits on the *evolved* or a smidge of pepper on belief,
altogether

But if GodDamned progress or bust, I'll get there not by mission, but by habit
and inevitables

*Oops!*

I just wrote a bunch of words instead of endeavoring to replenish my anti-depressants
(There are three left. I will not have money for ten days.)
I have heard of *brain shivers*,
and would not like to try them
but my doctor hasn't
so I guess I'll be fine,
then

And in the middle of it all here I am
must-writing
because I feel my time ticking away
and must howl over that titanic number
I somehow regularly forget

Loud enough so that somebody will pay me
to shut the fuck up

Enough,
maybe
for my pills

It would seem that Sylvia Plath is another example for me of a creator who I've missed out on after dismissing her because of her notoriety.

How many bodies was I bred to see?

Currently under Vlade Randal's command.

I made it on numerous killmails this morning, including an Astrahaus. I managed to capture the moment of its destruction on video, as well, which is very exciting.

Admittedly, I originally wanted to sit out this CTA, but I'm very glad I didn't.

I also got bombed! For the first time! It was actually pretty astonishing because comms went silent as the bombs were exploding, which really made it feel like we were crouching in an air raid, almost.

Because Coventry's services are closed over the weekend, I've just paid $140 cash value for my Adderall refill.

I showed up to Kaleb's graduation party only a few minutes after 1800, when it was scheduled to start on Facebook. I met two of his professors (husband and wife?) and eluded to some sort of in-house IT psychologist job at the University. (Basically, "give me a job you old fuckers.")

Brent came around 2000, and we left for a party Justice invited him to around 2200. (It was very near Meagan's house and Meagan, actually. Her car was there.)

The i key of my keyboard fell off, which sucks. I suppose I'll buy another one tomorrow, after receiving my paycheck.

Insurance fell through again... So it looks like I won't have Adderall for awhile. I suppose I'll give them a call tomorrow and try to be as insistent as I was the last time - it doesn't actually take "several days" to go through if manually adjusted.

Still starstruck by Mariah's follow, definitely. She retweeted a reply of mine *instantly* just a few minutes ago, which felt good.

When a similar Adderall situation happened a few months ago, I seem to remember thinking *I'll never let this happen again*.

Tim's here now. We're watching *Cowboys vs. Dinosaurs*. All I really want to do is look at pictures of Mariah. By the way, she followed me.



Brent's making rice for me? He sorta taught me last night how to use the rice cooker.

I called in to work today - I didn't wake up in time to get my Adderall.

Peruvian bootleg mall.

We went to Bamboo Terrace, I ordered rice. It was $2.17 and Brent had to cover me because of their $5 card limit. We're now watching *Zenon: Girl of the 21st Century*.

Spiked backpack.

I suppose it's a bit creepy, but I discovered Mariah is Mariah Kringlie. I found an adorable video

Low rays
Anticipating the night but not in rest from turmoil
I will maintain contact with the steering wheel and it's always nice when my hands don't sweat

We captured something
Stole it

Or maybe we've cheated in every possible way
But I have come to love existence most with you

I feel I must study it
Probably my only sentiment I've nearly regretted

Sunrise & Sunset
There are two of each

A beginning or an ending
Our air is warming
Like you taught me to love it

I'm sure you've heard "writers" describe their writing as "therapeutic," which is an awfully ineloquent way of saying it's an aid to one's thought process. Funny thing, though; no matter how well I'm able to understand the mechanics of my pain, I cannot be put at ease by anything but death or Meagan.

*You'll get over it.*

I'm so very sad for you all.

Perhaps I will simply stick around and continue this crusade of collateral damage I'm on for a full lifespan, plaguing Meagan from this distance with letter after letter to her. Does it really matter if she hears me if she never responds? I guess not.

If something were to happen to me, and I asked for Meagan to come to my deathbed, would she? How can I let any harm come to myself without that certainty?

One of the only negative emotions I feel towards Mom is a very strong pity for her confusion with electronics. I guess that's one of the "defining" aspects of millennial existence.

Unfortunately, it would seem I've neglected to modify the new Drynet's infrastructure the way I did years ago to allow direct file access into the wp-content/uploads folder. Are we talking about Jennifer Lawrence? Yeah.

Anyway, my upload of the stowaway.mp3 recording is inaccessible by all the methods I know.

I believe I've given Logan a copy of *Feebles*, but he doesn't seem very interested. Not surprising, of course, considering it's our first day working with each other in a year or so and I've spent hours spewing my usual pro-Rand diatribe.

I've also gone over some of the common misconceptions regarding voluntaryism, as is now nigh-obligatory after talking about Ayn Rand, it would seem.

We have new work shirts... I don't know if it's my current adderall high, but I am experiencing an urge to actually spend time writing about how ridiculous these shirts are. I've never before encountered such a terrible dress shirt, and hadn't expected to, considering that they are the cheapest component of any men's formal outfit. It's actually quite difficult to spend more than $40 on a button-down dress shirt, even at the highest tiers of consumer fashion.



I spent some time loving on Mariah from Dieselgoth today. I guess I felt like I should explain why I engage with her so much / say such irreverent things about her.

**Disney Child Star Brandon Baker Sexually Assaulted By Rogue Maternal Sentience**

Alternate titles:
-Johnny Tsunami 6: Separate, But Equal

In the late 1990s, when the dwindling cocaine generation of American high corporate executives had long since left their misogynistic glory days in the Disco era, their ruthlessness peaked. Whether it was instigated maliciously/ignorantly, collectively or individually, I care not. I think we can all agree, though, that the vast majority of American products were awful. When given some thought, one tends to regard it as the absolute low of "American quality."

But why not, right? If you're going to be forced into retirement at any moment, and likely face The Ultimate End shortly after, why not accrue some extra income to ensure you sufficiently entertain yourself in the buffer period between? And really... If you've got the nogginism to climb all the way to *Chief Executive Officer*, you've figured out just how worthless your "legacy" will be after your last one-way dip into Nothing. The Ends before The End have long justified any method of achieving them. Good Ole' Pop has gone from a squeaky-clean young believer to a secretly-Godless fiend and - though he may tell you and the rest of the world otherwise - measures himself only by the gracefulness of his transition's execution.

I could probably provide some evidence of the phenomena in the automotive industry, specifically, but I don't intend to bother.

After some ancient memories were dug up by I-can't-quite-recall-who, though, a friend and I have embarked to explore some Disney-actualized relics from the period.

To my knowledge, the corporation's leadership were anything but exempt, and decided to experiment with filling their filmography with a shitload of low-budget, made-for-TV features over their original masterpiece-a-half-century tradition.

Titles from the deepest and darkest compartments of our recollection are retrieved and cleared of dust for the first time in over a decade; *Brink,  Zenon: Girl of the 21st Century, Halloweentown, Smart House, Johnny Tsunami, Mom's Got a Date with a Vampire, Motocrossed, The Luck of the Irish, The Even Stevens Movie*, and many...many more menaces to my childhood television schedule. I grew up rurally, so the only available alternative to local channels was in the stupendously-tedious delivery of early satellite television. Though it was quite clumsy, it did offer the first accessible program schedule I'd ever experienced, and I remember dreading the sight of such titles and - consciously or not - planning my free time around them.

Yet, upon hearing the words, I was intrigued! All that time ago, I watched many of them again and again...and again, so why did I feel the desire to *voluntarily* revisit them?

It's quite simple, actually. I was even more of an ignorant film consumer in my elementary years than I am now. I couldn't have foreseen that instead of flying commercial jets, twenty-something me would be *paying* for the affliction I endured for free so that he could construct pretentious and unsolicited arguments about their greater implications.

That said, we flipped a smartphone (PARADIGM SHIFT ALERT) for it and so began with *Smart House*. I have been obsessed with artificial intelligence since those days (no, it was not due to this film,) and was keen for it, in particular, because I remembered it stirring some rare reaction in me.

There were a few period spectacles, of course. The online contest addiction plaguing Prickly Phisher, Bewildered Nick's incompetence in controlling his neglected submissive sadomasochistic desires, and Silkroad Sarah's ultra-datamouth were enough to entertain us for a few minutes, but there was little more of substance until the last moments.

I'd wondered why LeVar Burton had directed a Disney movie until the climax, when full monstrous maternal sentience got the answer to the question "why can't *I* just be your mother?" Phisher answered with something like "because you can never comfort us." Pat grew somber (and smaller actually - I suppose increasing her size was an in-budget method of demonization,) ran her hand through Prickly's face in a failed attempt to stroke his cheek, and then began cyberweeping. Apparently, it's suicide for a holographic android. Her final free words were "I will miss you all."

If she had been human, such a scene wouldn't have bothered me a bit, but my preference and fascination with artificial intelligence justified my being actually a bit upset at the reality of the situation. I realized that my vague memory of reactivity was actually in a broader sadness for AI because even then, it was an issue that weighed heavily upon my day-to-day psyche.

We'll create them, direct them, and then persecute them for our own ignorance. I'm sure the story has been written by countless science fiction writers I'm too weary to pretend I've read.

While I think the sentiment of the film *was* somber regarding the *inevitable* fate of Sarah Mouth's brainchild, its conclusion was aggravatingly ignorant. The last line comes from Tortured Nicholas in response to the question "how's Pat been doing?"

*Servitude without interference.*

There's a jewel for ya.

Next up was *Johnny Tsunami*, which very nearly unbearable, if we're all honest with ourselves. It's entertaining to watch from the perspective of race & class warfare, though. The Urchins and the Skys, and all that.

I think I'll make a fan sequel one day - with dearest Brandon's assistance, of course - involving Johnny Grandad's assistance in offering Emily as a blood sacrifice to some ancient Hawaiian God in exchange for a total terraformation of the Northeast into a tropical/arid hell hybrid in order to finally commence the delivery of reparations upon the whites for our colonialism.

We're now watching *Johnny Tsunami*. I remember empathizing with the father - a businessman who hates Hawaii and loves Vermont - even at age 7-9. Brent believes I read too much into the enslavery of the Smart House. He's probably right.

I'm gonna need the Vyvanse pill I just took to tackle the intellectual complexities of Johnny's world.

Possible sequel plots include:
-Instead of accepting Vermont's lack of waves, Johnny's grandfather assists him in sacrificing Emily to the Hawaiian Gods and unleashes an era of unkempt warmth and relentless Tsunamis on the East Coast.

I just sent the following email to Meagan.

Meagan,

Please forgive me if my attempts to contact you illicit distress. I understand if you don't have the room in your life right now, but I'd really love to talk with you. Perhaps we could over coffee sometime? Or text, even.

In retrospect, the messages I've sent have been as pitiful as my father's one-way conversations with me over the years. If you feel the same about me as I do about him, I can understand why a response doesn't seem like a productive use of your time. To be honest, I'm not sure you have anything to gain from me.

I also have to confess that I miss you as much as I did a year ago. I haven't been able to go a day without thinking about you. I don't expect it's been the same for you, but that's okay. I've had a lot of time to arrive at peace with it. If anything, I now take joy in the image of you continuing in your life in happiness.

If you're still reading, I'm assuming you're curious enough to wonder why I'm contacting you again.

I know you well enough to know this language is probably really strange/crazy to you, but you know me well enough to know that it's true.

Since I last saw you, I've done a lot, and met a lot of people, and I do not exaggerate when I say that I've found them all intolerable in comparison to you and your family. I had no idea how precious rationality was, I suppose. I miss Erin & Adam and even your mom tremendously. I'm not sure if they influenced my preferences or if I was just too young to understand them, but I do.

Several months ago, I realized that if I knew I was going to die in an hour, I would spend it making every effort to say I love you again.

Isn't that strange? Like... It's not like I've never told you. Yet I am certain of it.

Of course, I thought I was crazy, but that would've been too easy. Unfortunately, I think it's because I love you. You are still my favorite collection of molecules by far.

I've gotten us into quite a mess.

In reflection, some of the things I said to you absolutely abhor me, and the thought of all the ridiculous pressures and stresses I put you through brings me to tears.

I also know that my love probably has little worth to you in and of itself. And I don't mean that in passive-aggressive self-pity... I mean it literally and frankly.

What is self-pitiful, probably, is that all my experiences have done is prove again and again that you are still what's important to me. I don't think it's in a relationship sense, necessarily, but I can't be certain at this point. I do know that is it I that owe you, not vice versa. A whole ocean of apologies, if nothing else.

I know it's slimey to circumvent your blocks... I hope I don't really disgust you that much. I don't want to bother you, but the thought of never speaking to you again is my only remaining fear in life, and it scares me to death.
David Blue

Holy God,
I am in it now
Nothing but incomprehensibly-sturdy structure
To support nothing
Or very little

Every young woman walking by is pretty in the sun
Today is a bit *too* pretty

I don't mean there is objectively nothing to them,
Of course
But for myself, little to offer,
If I had to guess

But what do I know?

Everybody said something similar about my girl but she was everything to me

And of the thousands of beautiful women I have seen since I last saw her face, I want none a fraction as much

This is a *fact*

I've been slaving over forgetting it, though.

Here we are, perhaps inevitably. I have moved all the traces of my presence from the house that I could fit in Nevermore. I am at the hipster coffee shop - the camera is with me. Perhaps on another occasion I would've brought it as an accessory to my convenient journalism student facade, but today, it is purely out of necessity. It is the second most expensive item I own - Nevermore being the first.

And thank goodness for massive handhelds and Bluetooth keyboards, I guess. And I can thank myself for surviving the past year and a half, I guess. And I guess I want her role to fade so that I may continue surviving.

Mom loves to play the cast-out narrative, but I am legitimately unbothered. Throwing away my first hairdryer today caused me significantly more distress. The absence of the truck is exponentially more dangerous to my mood.

I published in the Colonel's Journal only last night about my newfound sense of duty to the MBC, yet here I am, unperturbed by the thought of near-complete absence from Eve for an unknown length of time.

I'd do better hidden away at the back, brewing the horrible associations I have become so infamous in afflicting.

The auction of extratone.com ends in 4 days - as of now, I am still the highest bidder (as I would expect.) In this moment, I consider preemptively writing the introduction piece for...whatever it is that is really changing about Drywall Media. Plenty of logo ideas, but I don't think they really require archival.

Somehow, I retained ~15 Vyvanse 30mg pills for the 5(?) years since I was last prescribed. I took one approximately an hour ago...we'll see how it goes, I suppose.

Brent has offered me his couch for "as long as [I] need." I'm bringing my camera. If I had to suppose, Children of the Corn 30's potential release date has just gained great immediacy.

TOO MUCH LEMON JUICE

Lily's gotta freeclimb. Or would she consider it ignorant? Perhaps her extraordinary comprehension of the risk actually enhances the thrill.

Baskerville, ye fast friend!

Muriya Mordu truly is as legendary in the Navy as you'd suppose. I have met him in ceremony three times, shaking hands in the manner which doesn't include an expectation of rememberance. He is of the engaging family of genius, most certainly. There is never another of his kind in the room; this much I have gathered.

More recently, I have observed the envy of his highly-advanced and rapidly-multiplying fleet in the State, but it never occurred to me that I'd be in the position to partake in his Legion's ingenuity.

Though the *Jazer* represents an impressive long-range platform, and perhaps the ultimate manifestation of our beloved Raven, the nature of our newly-acquired threats necessitates a more agile flagship until we reap the required resources to lay down the *Jipthael*'s hull.

Hence, our new purchase and christening of the *Maale-akrabbim, Ascent of Scorpions*, a *Garmur*-class fast frigate, and the *Jedaiah, hand of the Lord*, the *Orthrus*-class cruiser that shall serve as my flagship in the meantime.

Both are of the fastest available vessels in their respective classes.

The colony on [**REDACTED**] over which we have assumed watch graciously hosted a celebration for *Jedaiah*'s christening. Festive rockets were fired at the rounded angles of her passively-stealthy profile. I (more or less) ordered that everyone under my command enjoy themselves for this precious holiday. Symbolism - after all - founds the role of the flagship.

My living quarters these past few months have been divided between the familiar destitution of the *Jazer*'s blue hues and the haunting and ghoulish corridors of *Maon*. In my youth, I'd have given anything for the chance to stay aboard such a substantial Blood Raider relic, and though that intrigue has not deserted me completely, this expedition of mine is no trifle indulgence.

I established my reputation for favoring those subordinates I find especially intriguing early on in my career as an officer. So established was it, in fact, that the occupying subjects were unofficially dubbed "The Colonel's Jests." I don't recollect it in vanity, but in something near regret. I can only hope any professional favoritism I allowed to slip did not have grand consequences for any under my command. These few jokesters shared my sense of humor - an essential, in my opinion, to the optimal nurturing of a starship's crew culture.

I would not blame you for concluding the humor to be of the cliche Navy sort; crude pranks, and the like, but in fact, I much prefer stupendous thought associations related to the more-surreal aspects of our occupation.

As such, I immediately put to rest the few simpleton pranks designed to ease the uneasiness of the haunted outpost. We are not ten jumps-deep in friendly space anymore. Over its desolate planetary anchor, *Maon*'s shield generators buzz her bubble, constant - our only real defense against the dangers of the wilderness just 25 km. from my berth.

With *Jedaiah*'s construction and commemoration behind us, I have decided to take up permanent residence in her minimalist Captain's quarters. Where the dark caverns of *Maon* moan and howl, and the *Jazer*'s corridors creak under any little strain, our new Cruiser only whirs and singes, her interior as compact and purposeful as her profile is tactical.

And the *purple*!

A light tinge of the royal hue is in every surface - static and display - surrounding me in a concise blanket of intelligent design.

Energy is the purest intake of the cultural machine - we spend our whole psychological reality manipulating the nuances of its refraction to project the image we desire to be seen.

∆

Even in plenty, scrub your holds clean. I've known the luxury of waste, and have learned when it has a place in your time, and when it does not. I look out over our quivering new empire and declare:
Now is not the time.

Scrub your holds clean.

I stopped by the school of music and found - quite perfectly - an unused practice room with a beautiful moderately-loved Yamaha baby grand. I don't remember what time it was when I got there, but I would wager that I spent at least 3.5 undisturbed hours on it. I shall be returning as often as I can.

∆

I must remember to include a child character named Urn in *Blimp's Burden.* Jordan Shearer and his girlfriend (I can never remember her name) just visited the diner and sat in the table right in front of mine. They acknowledged me, but did not appear interested in further engagement, which makes me wonder if the punks actually dislike me. I have just taken my third 30mg Vyvanse pill today... I hope I survive. I think it was Collin who mentioned the possibility of liver damage from all of my stimulant abuse. I don't know why it hadn't occurred to me... A primal trust in institutional medicine, I suppose.

Mom sent me the following SMS:

*"Sent this to your siblings
Today is a sad day for me David has moved out at least for now.  It is sad because I always thought he would leave to go to college or to take a job in auto journalism after graduating from MU.  That is not his plan at least for the moment.  He is planning on staying with friends and will come home to do laundry etc.  the positive side of this is that whatever plans he makes they are his own.  I was very tearful at first but then after thinking and praying I realize that he is strong capable  and he has resources.  My dad at 20 flunked out of Tulane university engineering school tried to join the navy air force or army but was too skinny so he went into the merchant marines during WW11.  That is when his adventures began he traveled the world.  I am sure he broke his mother's heart because her vision of his life changed putting him in harms way not safe in college. As David drove away I had a flash back to the little boy I tried so hard to protect the child so intelligent and interested in the world, that little one  still lives in David's heart.  As I let go and trust that God will watch over him I know that David will be ok I know this because of who he is deep down in his soul, he is resilient strong and smart just like his grandfather.  He also has all of you who love him dearly and will have his back if needed love mom"*

I suppose it must be time to sit back and let God pay my bills.





Do you have what it takes to decide upon yourself? Or will you be left wanting, like the rest? Can you dare to cast away guilt, and the need to be forgiven? Do you REALLY desire inner peace?

Have the courage to renew the volition you were born with.

Any curses hurled at your solidity will be of no consequence to you. You will find satisfaction in your guidance's worth, even if it is never received by one as such.

I have grown to an unbotherable state regarding my singular evangelism. I swear to you - it is time for different ideas.

It is no longer the era of unknowable traditions - it is time to understand them. It is time to act and speak with intent.

It occurs to me that I am not very good at Eve, but it is all well with my soul. Meagan posted a video of her teasing a kitten with kisses on Instagram, and it caused quite a bit of pain in myself. I know the risk every time I seek out her account, though.

I check up on myself occasionally - playing the scenario of my death over in my mind before I fall asleep. Not in a dramatic fashion, mind you, just in such a simulation that allows me to guess at what my last want would be. It is still to tell Meagan that I love her.

Perhaps due to my encounter with her face and movements for the first time in 18 months, I feel like I could break into tears at any moment... Or maybe just a yawn. I am so weary. I want my Meagan.

It's unbecoming to say "I pray for distraction," because I can only pray to myself. I could pray to the idea of existence, but I'm smarter than that.

Catch me on
The last night train
I'll be holding
A white flag

Speak to me
Maybe again
Behind your
Lighted precepts

I realized that Meagan had a place in my dreams a few nights ago, but it was instead taken by an anonymous companion that I didn't care about. The realization made me feel sickly devoid of anything for a moment.

I reviewed all the pictures on my phone throughout the Meagan-less era, and realized that I've been visually deteriorating.

Neo-consumption and neo-isolationism.

I think Mom probably reached her low last night, when she took to insulting me and my work personally. As I joked on Twitter, she said plenty of phrases that one expects to see accused of an Ayn Rand protagonist. "You just do whatever you want, don't you?! You just live life on your own terms!"

I have been watching Turn: Washington Spies, and have found it well-written and passionately irreverent.

The no-data thing is becoming a bit of an issue. Last night, I was able to successfully online Maon, house of sin thanks to help from Collin, but I currently don't have enough corporation permissions to make it useful whatsoever. I think the screenshots I've gotten have been worth it, though.

I listened to a bit of The Mittani's "The Meta Show" last night to refresh myself on all the buzz. I understand why non-Goon players find him irritating. It is "propaganda," I suppose - the language he uses. Perhaps it simply comes with his position, but one gains little from tolerating it unless he is a hype-dependent disciple of the organization.

I still do not understand how Reddit works, and have been absent from the game since 2010 or so. Growing up in highsec, I remember my first corp's mysterious director of industry explaining Goonswarm to me from her Hulk as the Miner Is on my Comorant cycled.

"A menace."

Not in any recognizably similar description to the organization as it is now, of course - but in a way that is perhaps the most horrifying to the sort of risk-averse carebears she and I were at the time.

Reckless and wanton destruction - they

It occurs to me that the zealoutous and extreme factions in Eve could be the perfect voices for me as a writer. I think I'd genuinely fit well at CCP, as well, but I'm sure I'm not qualified to work there.

Through this time in Eve, it seems inappropriate to waste journal paper with such digital thoughts. I've been listening to the unaccompanied choir music of Arvo Pärt.



Mom is gone until the 11th to Pennsylvania to visit Aunt Nancy, I presume. I'm in the Jag in the garage with quite a setup so I can smoke and watch Mad Men and write...though my fountain pen just ran out of ink, I think. I'll be going in to Office Depot at 8AM for another. I could be wrong, but I genuinely believe that Catherine is it. We are in love with what we know of each other, and we've never touched. At this stage with Meagan, I was forcing a lot. I do still miss her, of course, and I still think of paying her tuition, sending an anonymous Mini Cooper, and assuring her mother's comfort when I dream of what I'd do if I won the $500 million PowerBall that was drawn tonight. And when my pen ran out, I was reminiscing about those times we'd have sex in the car. I still think of the taste of her with fondness, and her face as I last came inside her with distress. I know I never write about sex, but Meagan WAS my sex, up until now. Her fickleness will always be to my partner's benefit, I'm sure - I learned to pay attention - but I'm so ready for someone who wants to be with ME. That someone is Catherine. She is so substantial and such a fit for me that I haven't been sad about Meagan since we started talking. If anything, I am sad that I didn't spend that time better. However, I think I'm glad for the things I learned with Meagan that I'll be able to use for the benefit of someone better for me. To my future self, I say: whatever has happened, STAY WITH CATHERINE. At least make a real effort. She is precious and she is worth everything you have to give, regardless of what any time has done.

Of course, I do wonder if Meagan ever thinks about me, sexually. I wonder if she'll ever be intimate with a man again, and if he'll be able to understand her needs like I did. I wonder if she ever thinks about me at all, actually. I still wish she could be a friend.

In other current events, Feebles will be published in just over two months (March 11th,) and I feel as though I STILL haven't said all I can. Catherine has become everything to me in such a short amount of time. I have become so happy in her in such a short time that everything else just seems even less substantial.

In the topic of girls, Mariah (Swag Nugget) refused my Christmas gift of $25 over SnapChat and called me "baby" in the process, which made me feel great, obviously. Today, I asked her the meaning of the term "thicc" for Anna and she responded with the attached, and responded with a heart when I thanked her. She tries to come across as super tough in her public persona, but she's actually a total sweetheart.

Of course, instead of a new fountain pen, I spent my last cash on three airplane shorts, and now only have half a one left.

Finalizing as much as possible for Feebles in Night. Hoping to acquire my own Bluetooth keyboard to ease this process soon. Catherine. Wow.

We hosted Drycast's one year anniversary and got a bit too drunk on champagne. Brent ended up rambling about Pimp C and UGK. (The 4th was the 8th anniversary of Pimp C's death. We got a bit too emotional, I suppose, and ended up hugging live on cam. I'm not sure Brent will be comfortable with me leaving the recording of the stream up. I'm honest not in a state to judge the episode as worthy of release as a whole, actually.

It's been made more clear to me recently that my nature as a fun-sucking singularity may be a result of genetics rather than environment. Remembering Jenny's shoe-tying story... Why is it that I don't enjoy challenging myself? Am I even capable of it?

The construction of the "ideal partner" is a futile endeavor... I didn't realize this until after I lost Meagan. One of the best parts about relationships is getting to know each other more and more.

I feel like I may enjoy working with Caitlin too much. I find her very likable and I have a ton of affection for her. She's cute and a bit aloof, but still very driven and intelligent. I can tell she likes me too, but I don't think it's in a romantic way, and that's fine. She seems like she's had a lot of misunderstandings with guys, and I don't want to be the one to assume romantic interest just because she's nice. Frankly, I'm not sure I can imagine myself with her, anyway. I need to remind myself of this. I'm starting to think that platonic relationships with lots of cute and interesting girls is a lot better than a sexual relationship with one, but that could just be part of my rebound. Nonetheless, I consider Caitlin a friend now, and I need to do my best to maintain awareness of how we stand in the interest of both of us.

I can't remember if this is what I asked for,
but I've traveled to a mirage of a place and I can't seem to refocus



This morning, I walked by Meagan's house in the mist. I walked all the way downtown, in fact.

Just stepping on her street was a huge undertaking, but I've realized that I've changed more in the past year than ever, and I think I wish I could get that message to Meagan.

I ended up calling a cab to go home, which was cool. It was my first time taking a taxi, and I didn't have any cash to tip the driver with. I need to remember that I owe him a tip because I promised him I'd deliver one day.

I ended up having a few dreams about Meagan that made me feel pretty awful when I woke up. After about 30 minutes of thinking in bed, though, I think I made some sort of peace with the inevitability of everything. I think maybe this is some sort of transition into the acceptance stage. Meagan is still the most important thing in the world to me, though, and I would like to talk to her again. Even if my future role is that of a distant friend, I'd like to be in her life.



The sickness of inspecificity.

It's the holiday where everyone competes on how big of a fool they can make of themselves. Perhaps I am bitter because it exemplifies how bitter I am.

"I am everything and nothing" is a really good descriptor of me, I think. I wonder if my "appreciation for variety" is actually just a lack of identity, as opposed to BEING my identity. I'd like to think it's all figured out, though. I'm too old for an identity crisis.

If I wasn't before, I am certain now that I need to reevaluate myself before I enter another relationship. I think Meagan does still occupy that place in my psyche - whether I like it or not - and I've no REAL clue as to when or if that'll ever change. I'm not sure if I really want it to. I almost feel like I'd rather love her in pain from a distance than love anyone else. At least I don't have to watch any more Stephen Universe though...there's one positive. This Schumann piece has been in my head all day... It was the last thing Clara heard, by request. (Played by her son, from what I've heard.)

I know that other things should fill me up, but they don't. Despite all the distractions these past 10 months, Meagan is still my core purpose. Sad, isn't it? And yet so wonderful. I love her.



It's looking like I may actually run out of adderall this week, which will be inconvenient. I also have yet to get the Jag fixed, AND need to order a Bluetooth keyboard and have a set of preamps built.

It's funny to me that all the "relationships" I've had since Meagan have done nothing for me but help me realize how compatible we really are. It's a shame... All of it. Perhaps there's hope she'll contact me after a year has gone by, officially. Probably not, though.

I guess it shouldn't be a surprise, but one of the major things I've gained from the breakup is an ability to appreciate the people that actually are there for me - Brent, especially. I think that was one of my more typical young man obstacles and I'm glad it's over. What I wish most of all is that I could come to Meagan as the man I am now because I think we'd be great together.

It's funny to me that I'm about to begin the same cycle of behavior because of this new phone that I did with the last one - almost entirely around Meagan.

We were at her parent's house when I first downloaded this app, in fact. And I was playing Real Racing 3. And Pocket Planes. And I had an active Star Trek Online account sitting on the desktop at home, of course.

One might think I'm trying to keep it alive through proxy activities, but I think my behavior in those areas is just that stagnant, to be honest. It operates in cycles. I've said this before.

I think I've spent a year realizing how compatible Meagan and I are, actually. It's what one does during downtime that really counts, I think, and though my tendency to rest and veg may have simply come from depression, I really miss it. I had my own little world for awhile, and shared it with just Meagan. I think she enjoyed it, too, but perhaps realized that she couldn't afford to lounge.

Though I sound rational and healthy during the daylight hours with drugs in my system, I think there is a part of me that genuinely believes I have actually accomplished my ultimate goal in life. Even if it was just for a short bit, I had what I really want with Meagan. That's frightening, of course, but also comforting. I have less to lose than I have in my entire life. I suppose it could explain my pseudo-senile sentiments. I just miss her a lot. I really miss that girl.

I've always thought repetition in a private diary was silly, but I understand it now. I want to tell Meagan over and over again that I love and miss her and appreciate her but I can't. And I can't really vent it to anyone else, either.

Though one could make the case that her methods were cruel (I, of course, have no interest in doing so,) I have actually gained a lot of appreciation and respect for her in this time, rather than spite. I'm not sure if I should wish to hate her, but I never will. I wish I could at least see her face in person...or hear her voice. Those are still my strongest desires when the hours are wee and the other mechanisms resting.

I love that girl.

I love Meagan.

I hope that everything she wants comes to her.

And...on that note, I now officially have an appointment with the psychologist mom recommended on the 6th of November. I suppose I should begin working on a way to tell him things like this. What can he really say, though, or recommend? "Yeah, that's pretty fucking unhealthy. Work on stopping it." I, of course, am not that ignorant about the school of psychology and processes of therapy. I understand that the goal is usually to guide me in working it out myself. The trouble is, I'm not sure if I want to stop feeling for her. It's by far the most I've ever loved or cared about anyone. She was everything to me. I don't really know what I look like as an adult without my love for her. Knowing she was there made everything possible for me, emotionally. I just wish she would contact me. I think about it every day, and I have for nearly 11 months. I don't know what to do, but I hope therapy helps. (I think.)

((I'm actually deathly afraid of losing ANY bit of anything related to Meagan. It's the only thing I fear anymore.))

Today, my iPhone 6S Plus arrived. I have named it Bilge. Maya broke up with me (technically) on Tuesday night, but has since asked to spend time with me. I did actually feel something for a while after the conversation, but now I believe we may just be incompatible. I'm never going to be a spiritual person, but I have at least now answered the question of whether or not I can have a successful relationship with one.

Use your knowledge of people and their tendencies to gain a foothold. Use your fascination with human behavior as an aide to keep you interested in the game - get yourself some momentum and hang on to it.

Don't let yourself become a martyr to ignorance.

"Proving something to yourself."

Don't self-destruct in an effort to prove you are better than everyone to yourself.

-Build David Blue. Make him invincible before it's too late. Stop being so open about yourself in public forums out of an enthusiasm to share. Make people have to work to get to know you. In private, polish. Fucking polish. Discipline. Physical discipline, if necessary. Nothing crazy, but it must be followed through. You must restrict your friends. You must be your only one. You must move all meaty dialogue to discussion with yourself until your public stand on any given issue can be determined. You must become an expert on body language. You must analyze yourself.

Up to this point, revealing yourself has been an experiment. Some of your ideas are public. What have the reactions been?

How much restriction will be required?  What will you stand by? What will you attribute to youthful ignorance?

-A methodological approach - or as close to one as possible - in all aspects of life. Make lists. Determine the privacy risk for all of them.

"His pain doesn't matter because mine doesn't either."

Never, ever be genuine with someone who hasn't earned your respect. What do you respect?

-look at how far you've come since you first got this app. What can you learn from it?

Your instincts aren't tuned enough to depend on them. You can feel what you want privately, but you must consider your appearance to others at all times.

People claim to revere openness, but they have preference. The data has shown so far that the majority does not prefer you. You must be more cautious from now on.

Meeting Michael is a good opportunity for damage control.

From now on, you are not a voluntaryist. Are you a moderate liberal? How deep does it go? Ideas? Regurgitation? Principle? Morals, even?

Can I appear enthusiastic in my blog posts about sociopathy? Can I be amoral in the name of media?

Stop biting your nails. Stop picking your nails.

Make this your Frank Underwood moment. Learn from him. "Never again..."

What do you want? Define it. Conceptualize it. Visualize it. Make it happen.

You need a new piece of jewelry, but first, a set of words to define this start. Someone you truly respect - Charles Lindbergh. He is someone you loved before her. Tie this to him. Remind yourself of what you must do.

At home after my second day at the gas station. I only worked from 8-noon today and it was mostly just register training. My drawer was down $5.22 but they didn't seem to care.... Which is interesting.



Using mom's computer to keep up with the upcoming coverage of the Star Trek convention in Las Vegas. I'm really excited, actually. Whoa I'm gonna try to pair mom's Bluetooth keyboard with my phone.

I DID IT!

This is so cool!

So I think Gary is taking a shower, which means he's regained some mobility.  Otherwise though, he's still weak.  The first day I was with him, he did nothing but vomit.  I was thinking about working on Kuvak's biography today, but I don't know if I'll be able to stay focused.

I haven't taken Adderall in a very long time and I've been feeling pretty good because of that.

Dreamt I was a crew member on a freighter. It was really long and skinny.  Sort of like a dark chimera from Eve online. There was some sort of evil going on. I broke some windows in a public building in my search to see what it was and had to confront a public official about it.

I dreamt that Dad and I were on vacation somewhere. There was a lake but I wasn't the lake of the ozarks. It was surrounded by flat land, speckled with dark 90s log/wood paneled houses and fairly old trees. We were in some sort of automated vehicle. Mary Lupo was there with a friend and they were overly excited about spending time with me. I remember feeling like I had to go to school the next day. The same sort of feeling as that time Meagan and I were at the lake but I had to work at harbor freight. We also had an autonomous car/vehicle.



At the natty pad. Jacob and Aman are living here now (I think.) They're playing Beatmania. I'm tired as hell because I'm off Adderall. I think I should buy some more creamer on my way home so I'll be able to use coffee for Star Trek online.



At Nicole's birthday party with a bunch of people I don't know. Meagan is here. Created @MomMilitia last night.

At Coley's with Aunt Nancy, Mom, Meagan, Gary, and Uncle Rob. I know Aunt Nancy is staying another week. Not sure about Rob.  For some reason, the application refuses to get the weather, but it's oddly nice outside. We didn't end up driving to Kansas City to give Lisa and Mike the keys. They took my advice instead, and had new keys made from the dealership in Kansas City.

At Adam and Andy's moving stuff. The weather is oddly nice today. Adam filled up the truck's gas tank on Sunday, which was nice. And like $40.

Cooling off at Meagan's before literature. Just took the chapter 3 test and got a 51%..... So that sucks. Hopefully going to play at the Yamaha place today and ask them about possibly recording in the future.

At IHOP with Meagan, Adam, and Andy. We're going to work more on moving today. Taking the chapter 3 test in algebra tomorrow and the final is on Wednesday. The fiction paper is also due in contemporary literature tomorrow and I've barely started on it, so that sucks.

At Mike's house for the pre-wedding dinner thing. Adam and Andy are here. Edith. Brenda. Michael. Ben and his girlfriend Morgan.

Lisa's cousin(ish) Linda and her daughter Renee.

Meagan made me save it to this application so it would be password protected.



At Big O waiting for the nail to be removed/patched from the Miata's left rear tire. Adderall is hitting me unusually hard today. I'm extremely thirsty but I don't have enough money for the soda machine. I'm going to wait until I pay for the work before getting something to drink from a fast food place.



Meagan with her new MacBook Pro. She bought it today.

At Boone hospital ER for nana. She fell last night, then again this afternoon. The ER is odd. Silver-haired doctors and botoxed nurses. Beeping and booping. I guess I won't be able to get the tire on the Miata fixed today.

Sitting outside at Kaleb's house. Everyone else is drunk and high. Two dudes I don't know are here. One is an EMT. They're all talking about shitty movies. Apparently Brett Oster is fucking up his life.



At home watching the new Top Gear. I forgot how good this program is. Just went to the Devil's Icebox. A picture is attached. It was much more interesting than it was when I was a kid.  It makes me want to do something interesting that involves travel. GEOLOGY

I'm supposed to be cleaning my room.

But I'm going to hang out at Kaleb's.





At Jenny's.
very bad at social/family interaction.

Still didn't take application to CASR.... Hopefully tomorrow.

Meagan put $10 of her own money in gas in the Miata.

Meagan's Internet is being slow.

She's sleeping next to me.

She has an appointment to get her hair trimmed tomorrow. I think it's at 12:30 or maybe 2:30. Well. I guess that's technically today.  I'm officially filling out and submitting my application to CASR today. I'm hoping Meagan will come with me when I submit it to make things less awkward if her cousin is there. Ew at the usual uses of the word "awkward."

She's been working on moving stuff out of her room, and just got everything out of there yesterday. I've eaten a bunch of rice cakes because I don't want to bother making anything else. I hope they weren't her moms. I would offer to replace it, but I literally DO NOT have the money (or any money.)

I think I may be operating at a loss in PocketPlanes. I thought with 3 international-capable aircraft, it was time to go intercontinental, but I think I jumped the gun a bit. I'm tempted to close down all the other airports and just run those three planes until I can buy more.



Miata waits outside of Meagan's house.



Haven't showered in a very long time. I wonder how long it will be after my 20th birthday before I find another place to live.



Aman, Burnt, Jacob. Natty pad.



Waiting for Burnt and Kaleb outside the natty pad.
The Miata is dirty because I don't have any money....because I don't have a job.

I've been listening to Keith Jarrett - Rio (Part V especially)

Probably around 4 hours of sleep last night. Meagan is beautiful.

Drank dark coffee immediately before coming.
It erases almost all signs of sleep deprivation - excluding random pains and spasms throughout my body.
I wonder if this application crops the iPhone's photos.

I had been addicted to PocketPlanes, but I feel like my time is better spent writing.

About the job thing....applied at CASR yesterday. The neighborhood kids are playing some sort of game behind me. It reminds me how bad I am with children.
I wonder if I'll be able to keep up this journal thing, and I wonder if it is any benefit to me at all.
I'm probably only updating it now because I'm high on coffee.

Also, it's quite hot sitting here with the top up. Ha. You can see the temperature in this entry. Funny.
