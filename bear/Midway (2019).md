# Midway (2019)
- [ ] [‘Midway’ Review: Pacific Theater Action. Dinner Theater Accents.](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/06/movies/midway-review.html) | *The New York Times*

- [ ] The accuracy of the controls’ positions in the cockpits, even.

- [ ] The accuracy of the IJN’s protocols, even? (The way the helmsmen repeat their orders back.)

- [ ] x Reviews complain about the film being “overstuffed” with characters, but I think that was entirely inevitable and necessary in order to tell the story this way. 

- [ ] I *do* think everybody had way too much ammo though.

- [ ] I was under the impression that the historical fiction genre could be quantified/analyzed/reviewed differently… Like, what about *Battle of Britain*? Wasn’t this film sortof trying to be the contemporary equivalent? Because if so, I think they just about did it - exceed it, even, in some ways.

- [ ] Dennis Quaid as Halsey

- [ ] “This film is dedicated to the American ::and Japanese:: sailors who fought at Midway. The sea remembers its own.”
