At the fair with Meagan, Corey, and Britta. Lol America. I took an Adderall right before I came, but I'm still tired/quiet as fuck. I wonder if it's because there's so little mental stimuli.
There's a youth motocross race going on and I came up with plenty of good jokes about being at Laguna Seca for the MotoGP. (It's going on at the moment.)
