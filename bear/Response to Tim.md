# Response to Tim
> Thanks to uncle sam sharing some money, Im going to be getting my saab tunned up. Id like for you to give it a spin once I do, the sweds know how to make a fun car and I wish to share my joy I have had with mine. [this is an invitation of friendship, hope that it is received well, without any stipulation , as it its much needed in the times that we find our self's in. Hope you are well Mr. Blue]  
Thank you so much for reaching out! I’m sorry it’s taken me so long to respond... my social energy has dropped to absolute zero over these past few months. COVID is a convenient excuse but I also drunkenly wrecked my car in December 2019 and had my license taken away. As you can imagine, I’ve spent the time since holed up, trying to reflect on my decisions and not break anything. Also 100% sober now! And realizing just how much of my adult social activity was based around drinking. I’m so glad you’ve gotten to experience Saab life! And I hope you are thriving, of course. As for driving any automobile, it’s going to be at least until April, but if you can bear my company (I think I’ve changed quite a bit as a person since we talked last,) you should come see my old COMPAQ portable from the 80s sometime... It’s about the only interesting thing I’ve got left lol.
