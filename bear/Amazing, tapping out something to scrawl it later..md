Amazing, tapping out something to scrawl it later.
Perhaps it’s just that reading a character who’s convinced their existence can be somehow sufficiently explained in an elevator pitch can be the singular cause of someone’s feeling a similar sort of thing. What if my fatal flaw is not unusual or original at all? What if it is, simply, that my existence is a cycle of learning on my own through unnecessarily expansive (in effort and time) trial and error before getting someone possibly decent at the practice triggers me to need to move on to another one which I inevitably begin as an obvious, naïve idiot?
