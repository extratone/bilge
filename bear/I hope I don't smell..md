I hope I don't smell.

I think I've consumed 6 or 7 20mg Adderall pills since the last time I slept, but I suppose I was particularly keen to indulge after having been so stagnant for the past week.

I left $160 in cash on the kitchen table for Brent. This may be doable if I can move everything out of the storage unit and into "my" room.

It's been 9 days since I last showered, I think, which is probably coming close to a personal record. I am pondering whether or not I should ask to shower at Mom's, as I told her I would visit today.

I attended the alliance *Q & A* hosted by Parthannun (who just followed @Jipthael on Twitter from @parthannun2) but turned it into a "let's listen to me ramble on" very shortly after today's severance-related drama was briefly discussed. I gained the title "Howling Monkey" thanks to Joshee, and learned that she lives near Cambridge, is originally from Poland, but has an American husband.

I wasn't supposed to record the session, but I did with OBS. If I remember, it will be found on the external under the videos/Eve Online folder.

The ~10 minute-long video of this morning's Astrahus kill is rendering now. I shall do my best to remember to upload it while I am at mom's.
