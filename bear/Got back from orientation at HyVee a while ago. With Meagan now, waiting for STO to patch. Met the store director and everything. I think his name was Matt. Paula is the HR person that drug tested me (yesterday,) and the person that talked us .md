Got back from orientation at HyVee a while ago. With Meagan now, waiting for STO to patch. Met the store director and everything. I think his name was Matt. Paula is the HR person that drug tested me (yesterday,) and the person that talked us through everything. It took about three hours. I'm wondering how I can upload the store's philosophy of slavery to the customer above the consideration of the product without being on crazy amounts of Adderall constantly. I asked for 20 hours a week and set my maximum at 35. I reaaally hope I don't get much more than 20. I'm going in tomorrow at 8AM to start training + get my shirt and everything. I'll need to buy more khaki pants.
