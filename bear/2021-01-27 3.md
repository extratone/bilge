At home watching Deep Space Nine with Meagan. Miles, Amy and Gabriel are here. I've got to pick up Miles from skateboarding camp tomorrow at 2:30. I've been working on getting Kuvak up in STO. I've been thinking that a lifetime subscription would be a worthwhile purchase, but it's $300. I guess I'll start saving.
