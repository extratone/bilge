every human being of word persuasion has tried to get smells down
has tried to keep them
this late-August air is of a very particular nature

are relatively rigid,

Autumn is necessary for my wellbeing
and I can always count on it arriving,
eventually

when I'm able to wear my silk-lined coat again,
I carry a stronger memory of Her hugs with me
the long, silent ones
with my face buried in her curls,
my hands as flat as possible on her back
we must've fit & trusted more than anyone I'll ever hold again
because the girls I've held since,
I haven't really held
neither of us seem to be able to summon *it*
