Let’s learn more about Bear and some of its best features. If you need to start from the beginning, head back to [[Welcome to Bear]] or skip to [[Bear Pro with sync, export, and themes]] and [[Tips & Tricks]].

## Work Anywhere ☁️
Your notes are automatically saved on your device as you write; that’s why there’s no save button. 😄 

If you want to sync notes between your Mac, iPad, and iPhone, [upgrade to Bear Pro](bear://x-callback-url/open-bear-pro). Then, Bear will use your iCloud account to keep your notes updated across all your devices.

Bear also supports [Apple’s Handoff technology](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204681) between your iPad, iPhone, and Mac. This lets you start a note on one device, quickly switch to another, and keep writing.

## Tags and Sub-Tags 🏷
One of Bear’s most powerful features is *Tags*, a tool for organizing notes. 

When you add a word with a pound sign to a note—like —Bear treats that as a kind of folder or category for collecting all notes with that same tag. All tags appear in the Sidebar, the left-most panel of Bear.

Tags are a great way to group multiple notes of ideas, for a project, by topic, or in any way you can imagine.

Here are a few tips and tricks for tags:

* You can add as many tags as you want to each note, and they’re created on the fly
* Create [multi-word tags](https://blog.bear-writer.com/organize-notes-with-tags-and-infinite-nested-tags-c42b02b2c0d7) by surrounding them with pound signs. Example: `#Star Wars# #Home Improvement# #World Domination#`
* You can add tags anywhere in the body of a note (but not headings)—at the beginning, end, after each paragraph. It’s entirely up to you
* Select and drag one or more notes onto a tag in the Sidebar to quickly apply that tag to all of them

See [[Welcome to Bear]] to learn more about Bear’s layout and other core features.

### But wait, there’s more! 
Bear can also group related tags together as sub-tags. For example: say you add a note with the tag . The /organize/ tag in the Sidebar will become a sub-tag of /welcome/!

Sub-tags work like sub-folders in the Sidebar. Tap or click the close/open button next to them, and you'll see their related sub-tags. This gives you even more organizational power with tags in Bear, and we encourage you to give them a try for your workflow.

## Publish Everywhere 🌐
When it’s time to send your notes to other apps, a friend, or the world, click the *Info Panel* ⓘ button in the upper right of a note. It has a variety of flexible export options.

The free version of Bear can export notes to Plain Text, Markdown, [TextBundle](http://textbundle.org/), Rich Text, and [TaskPaper](https://www.taskpaper.com).

A [Bear Pro subscription](bear://x-callback-url/open-bear-pro) enables more formats including PDF, HTML, Word (DOCX), and even JPG to create an image of your note. Exporting a Bear note to JPG is handy for posting on social media and other places that have limited character counts.

## The Details 🔍
In the Info Panel you can also find *word count tools* including characters, paragraphs, and an estimated *Read Time*.

Bear has three main columns where you create, edit, and organize your notes.

![]((Original%20Bear%20Welcome%20Notes)/Bear%203%20columns.png)


* *Sidebar* (on the left): when you add tags anywhere in your notes, Bear will collect them in this sidebar. Think of them like folders you can create and use on the fly, while you write.
* *Notes List* (in the middle): all your notes live here, ordered by modification date. You can pin a note to the top of this list for quick access.
* *Editor* (on the right): this is where your magic happens; you’re looking at it right now. 😄

*Note*: In Bear for iPhone, you swipe between the Sidebar, Note List, and Editor.

## Bear has style ✒️
Bear has many text and style tools, including: *bold*, /italic/, _underline_, ::highlight::, -strike-, headings 1-6, and others. You can find shortcuts for them in the *Style Panel*:

* *Mac*: Click on the pen symbol in the bottom right of the Editor
* *iPhone or iPad*: It’s in Bear’s shortcut bar above the keyboard

Bear also has a range of [beautiful themes](bear://x-callback-url/open-themes) to give you a comfortable writing canvas. They are part of the features you can unlock with an in-app [Bear Pro subscription](bear://x-callback-url/open-bear-pro).

# Tips & Tricks
We’ve built all sorts of useful features into Bear to help you turn ideas into notes as fast as possible. Read on to step up your Bear game.

But if you want to start from the beginning, head over to [[Welcome to Bear]], learn how to [[Organize and Publish]] your notes, and check out [[Bear Pro with sync, export, and themes]].

## Advanced Search
Bear can instantly search all your notes, but it also has a number of [advanced search operators](https://bear.app/faq/Advanced%20search%20options%20in%20Bear/) that can focus on certain types of content in your notes.

For example, you can type `@todo` in the search box to find all notes with tasks, or `@files` to find all notes with attachments. You can also use `@images` to find _just_ those kinds of attachments. Finally, you can use double quotes to search specific phrases, such as `"bear is cool"`. 

## Browser and App Extensions
It’s easy to collect text, images, attachments, and entire web pages from other apps. Learn how to add and use Bear’s extensions for [iPad, iPhone](https://bear.app/faq/Extensions/iOS%20App%20Extension/), and [Mac](https://bear.app/faq//Extensions/Browser%20extensions/).

## Tap Those Tags
All tags in Bear are tappable and clickable. To give it a try, make sure you aren’t editing a note by pressing Command + Return with a keyboard, or swiping to hide the keyboard on iOS.

Then, in any note, tap a tag like tag—the Notes List will appear and show you all notes which contain that tag.

On Mac, you can hide the Sidebar and/or Notes List to enjoy distraction-free writing (on iOS, this happens automatically 😉). Use the Layout Selector (the bottom right icon) to see your options.

## Link notes together ⛓
One of Bear’s really fun and useful features is Note Linking. It’s great for quickly moving between multiple notes in a project, creating a choose-your-own adventure, or using multiple notes to welcome users to a fuzzy, red new app! 😉

To link one note in another:

* Type two brackets like this: *[[* anywhere in a note 
* Type a couple letters of the note you want to link
* A Suggestion Box will appear with notes to suggestion
* Select one of the suggested notes, and Bear will insert the note’s name, a link, and two final brackets in your current note

*Tip*: If you’re using a keyboard with a Mac or iPad, you can use the arrow keys and Return to select a suggested note.
