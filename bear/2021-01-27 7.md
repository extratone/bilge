Doing homework/studying for tomorrow's chapter 3 algebra test and listening to Keith Jarrett's Vienna Concert. It's been a long time since I've listened to it.

Also got a Nasenbluten tape (digital file) today and listened to some Stunt Rock stuff. He seems really like-minded, especially given his track titles and use of clipping/intentionally distorted stuff.

Roobie Phawl's first official show is at Fay St. today.

If I don't get a good grade on this test, there's a good chance I'll fail the class.

Meagan is sleeping behind me. She is beautiful.
