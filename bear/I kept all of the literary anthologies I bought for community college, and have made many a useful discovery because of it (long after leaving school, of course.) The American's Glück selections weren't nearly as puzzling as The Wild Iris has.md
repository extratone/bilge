I kept all of the literary anthologies I bought for community college, and have made many a useful discovery because of it (long after leaving school, of course.) The *American*'s Glück selections weren't nearly as puzzling as *The Wild Iris* has been, if memory serves, but that's not an unexpected transition, right? This is the expected collection; the first suggestion on Amazon, and now, I've presented some words for you, long after the fact. The recent arrival of my first of her printed works should not detract from my now-well-established (if a bit expectedly-sparse) fascination with this jaded and mysterious Vermont-locked savant.

What I remember of The Poetry Foundation's Louise Glück biography is rich and articulate, but I specifically avoided re-reading it for this *thing* that you are now consuming. I'm sure I've pledged I'd *never* review poetry in the past, but this particular poet (who is the precise opposite of *The New*, by the way) operates in such a unique context that I've (obviously) found the urge to spew irresistible.

*How should one format such a thing? I hope I never know.*

The format of the collection, though, is a bit mystifying. I'd bet you could find an explanation, if you searched a bit, but that's an especially silly pursuit within poetry as a medium, yeah?

Basically, I was originally quite confused by the multiple works called *Matins*, which is apparently "a service of morning prayer in various churches."

Perhaps it's a bit crude to be hung up on the contrast of the contemporary Yale-lecturing laureate who's masterfully-articulated, Pulitzer-validated compositions are mostly about being really sad and pissed at God? Within the universally-intimate boundaries of petty botany, no less?

If it is, brace for crude musings because I've just summarized most of my sentiments in two sentences.
