# Ava (2020)
please do not interpret the following as condescension, because it’s mostly observations about myself I thought somebody might find useful...
*Ava* is not a good film by any standard of measure, but I found it a worthwhile investment of my time. I noticed many of the reviews here criticized it for its lack of innovation, which is absolutely apt. *however*, I have personally come to realize lately that it’s important to allow myself to enjoy things even if they don’t have some quantifiable value. it was difficult not to turn off this film at a few points, but I’m glad I didn’t. there is real substance.
