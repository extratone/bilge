Here’s a consideration you might find tedious, but do bear with me:
Imagine someone gave you credentials 
for every single one of the faceless directories amidst impossibly huge datacenters throughout the world which serve timely all of the necessary image assets powering all of Apple, Inc.’s various digital vending platforms. Television and movie thumbnails (digital movie posters, basically,) the “cover” of every single digital book in Apple Books, of every edition of every album, EP, and single published on Apple Music… The absolute highest-resolution masters (effectively) in existence for any given example of this artwork
