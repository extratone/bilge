Brazilian futurefunk prodegy Pop Up! was one of our favorite sources for transition material in Drycast as it was early on in this very station's history. Having recently rediscovered just how superb Flavored was in 2016, we thought we'd just play it in its entirety today.  Enjoy! http://extratone.com http://twitter.com/extratone http://facebook.com/extratonemagazine

For years, we've drawn heavily upon the exceptional curatory efforts of one Isaac Pippen toward his now vast library of Future Music Mixes for our own Drycast, Futureland, and Extratone Radio since the beginning. However - after an absolutely incredible run - he has decided to move on from the TSQDance project, so we're going to be celebrating its long, varied life by playing our favorite picks throughout the TSQ Wave, VHS Wave, Nite Vibes, and COMNICORP series!
