âˆ† A Note on Appearances: Pennames & Avatars
I understand the appeal of a certain degree of anonymity in your online communications, but I think we must all begin to acknowledge that it is futile, for the most part. This is not a declaration made out of expertise, necessarily, so please discuss. I'm genuinely curious and I think it's most assuredly a relevant conversation for content.

Ideally, we'd all be writing under our "real" names with Gravatar profile pictures synced up with our external web presence, but I'm well aware that's a lot to ask, and it's (frankly) never going to happen.

As close as possible, though, would be nice. A penname (minimum: first and last) that you'll stick to, and a profile picture that - if nothing else - does not depict another living individual besides yourself. If you MUST write under a one-word username, you can do so, but make it not shitty please. Also, kill me.

I have a feeling the profile picture thing is gonna be a goddang mess, so I'm going to look into alternatives to Gravatar/BuddyPress for that particular feature. Eliminating author pics altogether may end up being necessary, which would be a shame.

A uniform @username across Discord, Twitter, and Extratone will be soooo worth any trouble it'd take to manifest for me and everybody, really. If you can't, don't be surprised or offended if I misidentify you all the time.

If this whole thing is offensive to you, just do you. If I was paying you, I'd make it mandatory, but I'm not, so all I can do is beg. I'd rather you write great shit under @shittingcunts420 than withhold your content out of abrasion with this standard.
