Spent all day taking care of Gary/getting his car from Dents Unlimited. He's in pretty bad shape. It was difficult just trying to stay awake. And on that note, I'm playing Star Trek Online and listening to Trek Radio at the moment. DJ Hick (the guy I used to listen to when STO was just in beta) has gotten his show back. I really wish I could've been more involved in Trek Radio. I'm sure they don't remember my name, and I wish they did. It's a pretty cool organization. They took the Enterprise-D bridge to Star Trek Las Vegas this year (I think the coverage starts at the end of this week.) I wish I could've been a part of that. They're going to be broadcasting live from it.

I was also thinking about the discrepancies between the image of how people should be that the night portrays and the reality of what it's occupants actually are.
