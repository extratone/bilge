Still awake. I suppose I probably overdid it a bit. Went to Mom's - she freaked out a lot and refused to lend me money (not that I pushed, of course,) which I'd somehow grown unaccustomed to already, as I had the sheer brightness of the house.

I explained to her again my current understanding of Meagan's influence on my emotional state, but it was probably a waste of time. She claimed that $320/month is some crazy amount for rent.

I probably Tweeted a bit *too* much Mariah adoration tonight. (She tends to occupy more and more of my mind as I get more and more tired.)
Graciously, though, she responded with a kiss emoji, which I swear I could feel on my cheek in my exhausted delusions. Assuming my IFFTT script is still working correctly, her particular self-positive Tweets that triggered my mooching will be archived by Evernote.

It's petty, but I happened upon the **Golden Age Simulations** Facebook page in the AOPA member thread, and liked the page. It's strange to find them still pursuing projects, despite the fact that Microsoft hasn't even had a flight simulator *team* in nearly 10 years, if I am informed correctly.

I also did my best to explain yesterday morning's diplomatic incident and my participation in The Northern Revolt to mom, which was humorous.
