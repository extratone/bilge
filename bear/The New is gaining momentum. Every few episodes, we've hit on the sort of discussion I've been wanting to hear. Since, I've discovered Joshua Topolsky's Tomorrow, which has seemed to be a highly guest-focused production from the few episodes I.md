*The New* is gaining momentum. Every few episodes, we've hit on the sort of discussion I've been wanting to hear. Since, I've discovered Joshua Topolsky's *Tomorrow*, which has seemed to be a highly guest-focused production from the few episodes I've listened to, but in the sort of context I've been hoping to manifest, simply because its cast is definitively passionate about reexamining the purpose of web content. (Topolsky's behind *The Outline*, which - from all current accounts - is something *Extratone* readers and writers will look forward to.)

A recurring cast of hosts is something that defines the podcasts I tend to enjoy, but I've never *really* attained it in my own production to date.

My friend Shinji's participation throughout *Drycast* always guaranteed worthwhile content (for me, anyway.) Our conversations remain some of the most entertaining and intellectually stimulating that I will ever experience, I'm sure. He and I share a peculiar hobby: contrasting our knowledge of early-20th century history with contemporary culture. (Hence, "Hella Hoes in the Heinkel.") He's an incredible wordsmith, and probably the only white rapper I can listen to without any cringing whatsoever.

I've yet to articulate adequately *why* these talks are so entertaining, but hopefully better archival and publication will give you an idea. Fundamentally, it is the *contrast*, which makes a pretty great name for a podcast, yeah? If nothing else.

The endeavor itself is not by any means constrained in humor. It is a primary tool of storytelling and arguing. As far as statements of purpose, this is what I've got so far:

"A studious discussion of human communication and its relationship with spectacle, past, present, and future."

The other personality, Nina, is also an extraordinary lyricist. Her late band *Something Witty* is one of those high school musical projects you *actually* want to hear.

It's early to make any pledges in regards to the show's regularity. Quality and succinctness will always be the higher priority.
