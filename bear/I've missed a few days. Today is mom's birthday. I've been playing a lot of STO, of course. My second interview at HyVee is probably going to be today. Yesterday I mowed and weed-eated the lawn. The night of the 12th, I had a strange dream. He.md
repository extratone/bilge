I've missed a few days. Today is mom's birthday. I've been playing a lot of STO, of course. My second interview at HyVee is probably going to be today. Yesterday I mowed and weed-eated the lawn. The night of the 12th, I had a strange dream. Here's how I described it to Meagan:

"Basically, we were in a house that looked kinda like my grandfather's house. Some people I don't know we're to my right and you were to my left. The tornado siren went off, I looked at my watch and it wasn't noon so I made some comment about the possibility of them testing late or something. Then, the noise of jets came and got really loud. There was a brief image of a plane's wing as it went by the window and then everything started turning white. I turned to you and hugged you and said "I love you" over and over again as I got hotter and felt myself disintegrating. I believed everything was real too it was kinda scary but not as scary as you'd think because I knew I had to hug you and tell you I love you and that's all. My last thought was that I was happy we were together."
