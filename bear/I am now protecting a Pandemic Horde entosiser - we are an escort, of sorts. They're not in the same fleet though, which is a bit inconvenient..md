I am now protecting a Pandemic Horde entosiser - we are an escort, of sorts. They're not in the same fleet though, which is a bit inconvenient.

I tend to love this sort of role, though. Defending each other makes me feel like I'm fulfilling duties, I suppose.

Apparently, "Sword Fleet" is the doctrine fleets we've been fending off.

**From Reddit:**
*Hyperspatial rigged combat ceptors. The idea is to fly around at 12AU/s ganking undefended entosis ships. It's a solid counter to Horde's "swarm of dozens of unfit entosis slashers" attacks, and can work well against undefended entosis ships even if they have a defense fleet one jump out on a different node. Can also be taken out roaming/ratter-hunting through hostile space. DPS issues are mitigated by having 50+ dudes.
Obviously it goes down like moths to a flamethrower if it runs into a real fleet.*

I don't precisely know how the entosising mechanics work, but I do know the module (and that it consumes stront,) and that enough use of such a module on any type of "node" will eventually "finish" it - which destroys it, in effect.  And if you do enough, something gets captured?

Oh well. This is not knowledge I require, yet, and probably will not...ever.

I am continually surprised by the competence, diversity and intelligence of the people I've met in *Eve*. I almost always enjoy talking in comms, or just listening, even. In my participating in an entosiser's escort, I am contributing to the capture of a system on the frontlines of what is currently the largest war in the game.

I think it's adorable that we all "salute" each other with o7.  My squad is using the *Extratone* public correspondence channel to stay in-touch with each other since apparently the game does not offer a squad channel option.

I have no idea how inter-communication with PH is being handled, but it must be a pain in the ass considering that I haven't seen them in the Darkness comms at all. I'm now having a beer, as I have consumed the three Adderall tablets I had left, in hopes of being able to have my script refilled tomorrow before work.

I suppose I've missed out on a few lore opportunities - and should not
forget my collaboration with Shigeo Kurumaya.

I'm not sure how fleet participation is being tracked, but I certainly hope my actions tonight will place me in a better light with TMA Directors.

**TO DO**
âˆ† Draft some sort of introduction to *Extratone*, and hope to God it isn't lost out of lack of payment between now and Friday.

A response fleet to the Goons' now-anchoring Citadel is scheduled to begin in 30 minutes, I believe. I'm not sure I'll be able to fit up something that would actually contribute to the destruction of the structure itself, but I may arrive in *Haruphite* in case some fast fleets are needed to herd stragglers/would-be escapees.
