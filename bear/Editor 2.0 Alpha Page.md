# Editor 2.0 Alpha Page
![](Editor%202.0%20Alpha%20Page/card.jpg)
***Alpha**, noun - From the Greek word meaning “this is not finished, many features are missing or not working yet, **do not use this for mission critical work**.” Supposedly, alpha is also the first letter of the Greek alphabet*.

This “Panda” alpha test is a standalone Mac app, so it lacks most of Bear’s other features. This makes it easier to work on new Editor features and crank out test builds.

Later, we’ll have a full Bear + Editor 2.0 beta. Yes, an Editor 2.0 test for iPad and iPhone.

* **Many features are missing**, others are unfinished. This is just a test build to get feedback on specific new features
* **Create backups of backups** Just to be safe, use this on new files and copies of existing files

We have more in store for Editor 2.0. But to start this alpha test, you can focus on these features.
