Echoes o'er the gates.

In this war, no words are true enough to allow to pass our skulls.

I reckon myself more than strong enough to delve confidently into the enemy's public correspondence without fear of their propaganda.
*Here lies one of the advantages of my fleeting relationship with duty.*
We swear ourselves to mantras, as they do. But I swear - seen but shallowly, we swear to the same creed of understanding.

From the mouth of The Mittani comes, occasionally, wisdom I would not expect. But like all maneuvers in the loud heat of warfare, small gestures must overcome the noise.

We should not endeavor to be empires, I don't think. I do not believe the form to be as lucrative as others. We are supposed to make The New, here, but - though some of us have lifetimes in our minds - our society stumbles into primal error after primal error.

But I am thankful to fight - as I was bred to - for a way of life that suits me so.

When our foe fleets require their few opportune coagulances, I like to sit above one of the barren iceworlds and listen through the transceivers to its frigid chorus.
