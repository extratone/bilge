Depending on what's left over after rent and settling storage debt once again, I think I should continue ratting in 1G to see just how much I can grind up. Skill injecting my way through the 20d-long Advanced Spaceship Command V is probably not within my financial means, but perhaps I can at least knock half of it off.

The *Jipthael* now sits in my ship hanger, ready to be crewed and painted. (I must remember to get a plethora of screenshots before *and* after the skin's application.)

I need to decide if I'll be building the dread or buying it. (Building it makes more sense since I have the BPC & plenty of the materials.)

@Ashterothi followed me back on Twitter, which is pretty cool. @Jipthael is a study in the benefits of narrowing your subject matter on an account.

I need to remember to **apply for SRP** for at least one of my Jackdaw losses.

I think it would be cool to attempt an in-character piece detailing the experience of operating under Sort Dragon.
