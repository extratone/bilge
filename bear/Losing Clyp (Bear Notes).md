> Hi, my name is Brad and I'm a web developer and music enthusiast living in the UK.  
>   
> I've been a part of the music production community since 2012 and know that music producers often need to quickly share their unfinished music so I built Whyp to hopefully make this as easy and fast as possible.  
>   
> I'm undertaking this project for fun and because I want to help the community but it's costly to host the website and storage, and development takes a lot of my free time. The site is free because I understand that music production is already an expensive hobby (hardware, DAW, plugins, etc), but if you find it useful and wish to financially support Whyp development, server costs and storage costs, I would be very grateful.  
>   
> Thanks for reading and for being a part of my project.  

- [ ] On my main Clyp account: a total of just under 3 hours of audio. The downloads total 256MB.
