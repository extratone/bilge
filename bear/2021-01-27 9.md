Trendy/stylish intro to an update of this app.

Sitting in the basement making stupid vines and watching House of Cards. I should be working on all the algebra homework I have + trying to rescue my grade but I won't, of course.

I love her a lot.

Fleet and the Furious: Drakesville Drift notes still need to be transcribed. I need a secretary.
