# Reading

Since I first began working online in 2016, I have grown and maintained quite a curatorial habit, and therefore sought all sorts of modern curator's tools. The system I settled upon for some five years: a dedicated [Reading List channel](http://bit.ly/extratone) in *Extratone*'s Discord. It wasn't until this past year that I encouraged something which (so far) has exceeded willy-nilly copy-and-paste of URLs into a single feed. It's an application/bookmarking service called [**Raindrop**](https://bit.ly/dbraindrop) which includes tagging, public, RSS-enabled collections, and fairy competent web page archiving. I became a paid subscriber within minutes of discovering its existence, three months ago, and have since integrated it quite hardily in my workflow (including automated reposts in that same Discord channel, for good measure.)
