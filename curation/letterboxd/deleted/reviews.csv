<p>It&#39;s a little late to write about <em>Greyhound</em> - Tom Hanks&#39; <a href='https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000158/#writer'>first screenwriting credit</a> - which released on Apple TV+ on Father&#39;s Day, June 21st. Though I definitely left my quite severe obsession with WWII history in my prepubescence, I thought I&#39;d remark on this film because I originally hoped it would fulfill a role I&#39;d long wanted for: the destroyer-side compliment to U-boat films like <a href='https://letterboxd.com/film/das-boot/'><em>Das Boot</em></a> and <a href='https://letterboxd.com/film/u-571/'><em>U-571</em></a>. James D. Hornfischer&#39;s exceptional account of the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Samuel_B._Roberts_(DE-413)'>U.S.S. Samuel B. Roberts</a>&#39; part in <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_off_Samar'>The Battle off Samar</a> with <a href='http://www.randomhousebooks.com/books/82865'><em>The Last Stand of the Tin Can Sailors</em></a> was my last dive into naval history. It&#39;s one of the most astounding war stories I&#39;ve ever encountered, and upon first seeing <a href='https://youtu.be/eyzxu26-Wqk'><em>Greyhound</em>&#39;s trailer</a>, I was sortof hoping it was the Big Boy film adaptation its always warranted. (Though apparently there was a <a href='https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1068999/'>TV movie</a> made in 2005???) Instead, its based on (distinct from &quot;adapted from,&quot; apparently) a 1955 novel by English author C.S. Forester entitled <a href='https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/260852968364965888/737932123159265300/The_Good_Shepherd_-_C.S._Forester.pdf'><em>The Good Shepherd</em></a>. </p>

<p>Tom Hanks made sure to imbue his first screenplay with a <em>shitload</em> of &quot;<a href='https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/jul/06/greyhound-review-tom-hanks-second-world-war-film'>opaque naval jargon</a>,&quot; as <em>The Guardian</em>&#39;s Peter Bradshaw&#39;s review put it. A brief <a href='https://www.thecinemaholic.com/greyhound-ship-world-war-ii/'>&quot;investigation&quot; by <em>The Cinemaholic</em></a> suggests that the U.S.S. Keeling - the film&#39;s singular setting - most resembles a <a href='http://destroyerhistory.org/goldplater/mahanclass/'><em>Mahan</em>-class destroyer</a>, though none actually bore the name. For the actual photography, the production made use of a surviving example of the <a href='http://destroyerhistory.org/goldplater/mahanclass/'>most mass-produced destroyer</a> of all time:</p>
<blockquote><p>When it came to shooting the film, instead of relying completely on sets, the crew of ‘Greyhound’ found another option. They used USS Kidd, a real WWII destroyer, to film the journey of Greyhound. She is a Fletcher-class destroyer and is named after Rear Admiral Isaac C. Kidd, the first US flag officer to die during the Second World War.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As much as you&#39;re going to loathe it, I must include this commentary on <em>Greyhound</em>&#39;s historical accuracy if only because - as a undoubtedly mainstream film - its been so widely and competently reviewed, already, by real film writers (see <strong>Further Reading</strong> below.) I am almost positive U-boats would rarely - if ever - waste their precious few viable torpedo shots firing ultra-close-range at the agile, super-speedy destroyers and destroyer escorts that protected supply convoys, and I am <em>sure</em> that none ever bothered with <em>audibly addressing enemy ships</em> over the radio in English. I understand that dramatizing historic events is the core function of <em>Greyhound</em>&#39;s genre, but this particular addition was so unbearably cheesy that it utterly decimates all of the experience&#39;s hard-won context. Just look at a snippet from the first of two dialogues in text:</p>
<blockquote><p>Greyhound. Greyhound, Greyhound.</p>
<p>This is Gray Wolf.</p>
<p>We hunt you and your friends
Eagle, Dicky and Harry.</p>
<p>We watch your ships sinking into the deep.</p>
<p>We hear the screams of your comrades
as they die.</p>
<p>How many of them will there be
before you join them?</p>
<p>The Gray Wolf is so very hungry.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I&#39;m sure there&#39;s an essential academic film function which only similar enemy taunts could perform and without which this screenplay would&#39;ve been <em>technically</em> unsound, and - if I were allowed supposition - I would venture to guess that America&#39;s Favorite Dad felt pressured to bolster his first penning against easy gimmes for the Great Big institution of cinema criticism as much as possible. </p>
