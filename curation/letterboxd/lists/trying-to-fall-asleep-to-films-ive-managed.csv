Generation X, I really fucking hate you…

It’s probably a phase that’ll pass when you no longer have economic and cultural dominance, but your movies just… aren’t as great as you continue to insist they were.

I would never bother to actually document a rant this way were it not for the amount of people <b>my age and younger</b> who <i>won’t stop fucking telling me to watch their parents’ movies</i>. 

Just kill me, okay?"
