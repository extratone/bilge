Hello again! The *too long, cannot read* of this post is basically *hey, I almost forgot about this subreddit but it's actually going to be used, now, because I have actually become a Real Reddit User.*

# Introducing: The Official David Blueâ„¢ Subreddit

Hello, human beings of the world, and welcome *back* to my personal space on this Web Site.

My name is David Blue, and I am now a sincere, active, and invested user of Reddit, which has only been true for the past year or so. I've always had [an account](https://www.reddit.com/user/AsphaltApostle), of course, but I never bothered to actually *learn how to use the site* out of some shallow, boyish sense of superiority. (I thought myself very funny in referring exclusively to it as "[the read it web site](https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/1018237705719668736)," and still sorta do.)

Perhaps thanks to the Big Sickness and/or my personal life situation (which I need not elaborate on here, tbh,) but *probably* entirely because of Reddit's redesign, I have recently become a daily active user and continued to discover new ways to integrate sharing, here, into my daily life.
