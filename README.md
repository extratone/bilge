# Bilge (Writeas Blog)
## Documentation for my blog, [bilge.world](https://bilge.world).
I proudly use [Write.as](https://write.as) as my blog's CMS. I am relatively new to Git and GitHub, but it occurred to me that a repository would be a great place to track technical changes and even versions/revisions of drafts.
