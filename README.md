# *The Psalms* Editorial Documentation

---

> **Note:** **THE TECHNICAL DOCS HAVE MOVED**. For the sake of my own sanity, all technical documentation regarding Write.as/WriteFreely has been moved to [**a dedicated repository**](https://github.com/extratone/writeas). 

## This repository encompasses the whole of both the editorial and developmental processes involved in creating [bilge.world](https://bilge.world).

See [**my 2020 reflectory post**](https://bilge.world/2020) for a few more details.

## Git

- As part of [my continued exploration of Git as an editorial tool](https://github.com/extratone/bilge/discussions/86), I have done my best to make use of as many GitHub-specific features as possible.

- [***The Psalms'* Project Board**](https://github.com/extratone/bilge/projects/1) tracks ideas, notetaking, research, documentation, drafting, revision, and extra-site discourse (like Tweets or *HackerNews* comments.) Its left-most column also documents style and technical changes to its code.
- I've been using [**Issues**](https://github.com/extratone/bilge/issues) to document just about anything, including all of the above, as well as any other specific subject involved (ex: [an "official" wallpaper pack](https://github.com/extratone/bilge/issues/97).)
- [**Commits**](https://github.com/extratone/bilge/commits/main) function as a chronological revision-tracker which I have indeed made use of in a few, particularly dire writing situations.
- I've been slow at integrating the [**Wiki**](https://github.com/extratone/bilge/wiki), but its uses - such as documenting [specific editorial definitions](https://github.com/extratone/bilge/wiki/%22Undercovered%22) - will continue to be expanded.
- [**Discussions**](https://github.com/extratone/bilge/discussions) are an intriguing possibility for external feedback (stop by and say something! really!,) but explaining why my general audience should have a GitHub account to participate even if they have zero interest in *dev* shit is going to be difficult.
- Within the code, you'll find my [**voice notes**](https://github.com/extratone/bilge/tree/main/audio/Voice%20Notes), an [**image library**](https://github.com/extratone/bilge/tree/main/images), and a variety of other miscellaneous associated files (better organization [is coming](https://github.com/extratone/bilge/milestone/1).)
