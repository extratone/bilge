In writing my upcoming column on Bandcamp (which I hope to publish in the next day or two,) I decided to see how many interviews I'd have to search for any mention of the term "Bandcamp" and the result was... all of them, essentially. At least it led to [this handy list](http://extratone.com/jlininterviews)! I'm excited to read them all soon.
