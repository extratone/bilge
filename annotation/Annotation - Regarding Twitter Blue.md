> #### Will Twitter Blue subscribers receive preference when receiving account support?
> 
> Our goals include providing the best customer support in our industry. We’re committed to treating everyone fairly and equitably. The Twitter rules won’t apply differently to subscribers, and they won’t get faster service on issues like content moderation.

> #### Will Twitter Blue subscribers receive different support for enforcement issues like account blocks?
