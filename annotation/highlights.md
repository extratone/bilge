As a writer, the way I’ve been using tasks has been to create a new one for every story I write and research, so that I can separate those ideas out without them getting in the way of everything else.

# [Apple should take a break from annual iOS and macOS updates - The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/22771079/apple-macos-monteray-ios-15-mac-iphone-software-operating-system-updates-space-out-features)

> To solve the issues of lackluster annual updates, Apple should do two things. First, it should continue to build out point releases with additional features throughout the year or even unbundle app updates from its annual releases entirely. Did the FaceTime team come up with a great new feature that’ll make pandemic chatting easier? Release it when it’s ready! Second, it should start to space out its major software releases, waiting an extra year or two between iOS or macOS versions to ensure that when it does release a “new” operating system, there are actually big changes to be excited about.

> As an independent, youth-oriented publication it is both our privilege and our duty to seek out innovative methods of communication. In written composition, this means all possible avoidance of unnecessary cliche and/or overused terms (for instance: use of the term “struck” in a metaphor - e.g. _what_ **_struck_** _me_) except where they are critically portrayed. It is essential to remember that **the English language is no more than a tool for our use**, and grammar should not be revered as an immalleable, Holy absolute which we must venerate and obey. Rather, it should be irreverently and liberally manipulated to perform as desired. **Grammar should never be an obstacle** or burden in our writing or editing, and should always be discarded in favor of innovative and/or contextual verse.

> 
> A while ago I found an [interesting bug](https://github.com/Microsoft/ChakraCore/issues/3050) on Edge. Basically Edge is treating characters as whitespace that it shouldn’t. It appears to be unicode combining characters that exhibit this behaviour. What if we combine this bug with Zalgo? We then have ZalgoScript! I first generated a list of characters that Edge treats as whitespace (of which there are a lot, check the github issue for the list). I decided to fuzz the characters 768-879 (the fuzzer code includes that range by default), the fuzzer logged that character 837 along with any character within the 768-879 range produced side effects. This is cool; I could loop through this list and combine characters to produce Zalgo that was also valid JavaScript.

So, for example `\[[title]]` would be ignored and not replaced with the title of the draft. The escaping backslash would be removed, however.

> In the world of note-taking, it’s hard to find a third-party app with keyboard integration as strong as Agenda’s. I had to qualify “third-party app” because Apple’s own Notes app has surprisingly extensive keyboard support itself. But while Notes may get all the basics right, Agenda is a more complex app and thus it’s even more impressive how much of the app can be controlled via keyboard. Though the app can still revert to touch-only in popover menus, its primary shortcoming, outside of that you’ll find basic navigation via keyboard but also a rich set of shortcuts for doing even obscure things like adjusting line spacing or text size, moving notes before or after one another, hiding or revealing different side panels, and much more.

> 
> After the installation of iPadOS, at approx. 6 GBs, leaves 8.5 GBs of of free, internal data storage space.
> 
> iOS/iPadOS needs a minimum of 2-4 GBs of constant remaining storage, AT ALL TIMES to insure/ensure nominal, acceptable operation of all iOS/iPadOS functionalities.

> This is virtually NO internal data storage to do much of anything with that 16 GBs iPad!

> Back in 2014, the iOS system software was NOT as large a file size, as it is today!

# [Things 3.6 Reimagines External Keyboard Control on iPad - MacStories](https://www.macstories.net/reviews/things-3-6-reimagines-external-keyboard-control-on-ipad/)

> Despite Apple’s [message](https://youtu.be/sQB2NjhJHvY) that the iPad Pro can be a viable PC replacement because, among other features, it natively supports a [dedicated external keyboard](https://www.apple.com/smart-keyboard/), its software still isn’t fully optimized for keyboard control. This isn’t surprising at all: iOS was designed with multitouch in mind; as long as the iPad shares a common foundation with the iPhone, it’ll always be first and foremost a touch computer. The iPad Pro line, however, is [nearing its third anniversary](https://www.macstories.net/stories/ipad-pro-review/), and its external keyboard integration still feels like an afterthought that’s hard to reconcile with the company’s marketing.

> I think Things 3.6 is also a statement of sorts – a message to developers of iPad apps, including those at Apple, to extend their keyboard integrations. Things 3.6 may be _just an app_, but the idea of complete keyboard control should be applicable to every area of an operating system as well. Can you imagine if iOS worked this way too?

# [Drafts Templates - Drafts User Guide](https://docs.getdrafts.com/docs/actions/templates/drafts-templates#custom-tags)

> Custom Tags
> -----------
> 
> In addition to the predefined tags always available, scripts in an action can create custom tags which become available to action steps run after the script in the same action. This is useful if a scripted action step processes text to create a value that then needs to be inserted in a later step that shares that text. The below example shows a simple script with creates a tag.
> 
>     let s = "My String Value";
>     draft.setTemplateTag("mytag", s);
>     // after running this script, templates later
>     // in the action will have available a [[mytag]] tag.
>     
> 
> Custom template tag values can also be created using the [Define Template Tag action step](/docs/actions/steps/utility.html#define-template-tag)

> If you want to use something which would otherwise be evaluated as a template tag or function but not have it evaluated in actions, it needs to be escaped by placeing a single backslash () character before it. So, for example `\[[title]]` would be ignored and not replaced with the title of the draft. The escaping backslash would be removed, however.

# [A Month with iOS and iPadOS 16: A New iPad Era - MacStories](https://www.macstories.net/stories/ios-and-ipados-16-impressions/)

> In building Stage Manager, Apple sought to combine the objective benefits of multiple app windows shown onscreen (you can do more things at once) with interaction boundaries designed to eschew the typical complexity of window overlap and resizing.

> This feature can also be activated with Globe+F

> you can keep pressing Globe+F to toggle back and forth between full-screen and the window’s previous size and placement.

> **Minimize**: with this button, you can remove a window from the current workspace (without closing the app) by minimizing it back into the recent apps strip. I’m not sure if “minimizing” is the best word for this, but its associated ⌘M keyboard shortcut matches macOS, so I assume it makes sense for consistency’s sake.

> **Close**: this is the big red button that outright closes a window (if an app has multiple windows open) or closes the window _and_ quits the app (if it has only one window open). This feature can also be activated with ⌘W (again, matching macOS) and it’s what you need to use if you want to remove a window from your current workspace without having it end up as a standalone window in the recent apps strip.

> Just the other day, I was writing this article in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md), checking some reference material in Notes, reading some questions about iPadOS from members in [our Discord](https://club.macstories.net/faq/discord), and viewing some of my liked tweets in the Twitter app about Stage Manager.

> I can seamlessly switch between them by clicking them or cycling through them with a keyboard shortcut; I can even drag and drop files and other content between them.

> Obsidian is a perfect example here: the app is far from feeling native on Apple’s platforms, but because its developers did the work to support Split View, Slide Over, and Auto Layout before, it works out of the box with Stage Manager when you resize its window. Make it very small, and Stage Manager will turn it into the iPhone version of the app, running on iPad alongside three more apps in a Stage Manager workspace.

The iPhone app is simple to use. Just tap the app’s big red button, and it starts listening to your surroundings to pick out what’s playing. You can manually scrobble each song with the press of a second button or go to settings to auto-scrobble songs. There are also options to mark a track as Loved, view it on Apple Music, and add it to a dedicated AirScrobble playlist. For $7.49/year, you can get AirScrobble+, which adds your scrobble history using the app and lets you access your scrobble history on Last.fm to scrobble songs that way.

# [Flags & Tagging - Drafts User Guide](https://docs.getdrafts.com/docs/drafts/tagging#scoped-tags)

> Scoped Tags
> -----------
> 
> [COMING SOON!](/public-beta/ "Coming Soon in Drafts v33")
> 
> Scoped tags use special markup to limit assignment to only one tag in the scope, and can be a useful tool in creating workflows in Drafts.
> 
> Scoped tags are in the format `prefix::tag`. Drafts will automatically limit any single draft to having only one tag with the scoped prefix assigned at a time. For example, if a draft is tagged `status::new`, and you assign it the tag `status::in-progress`, the `status::new` tag will be removed from the draft. This applies whether the tag was assigned via the user interface, automatically by an action, or even in scripts.
> 
> To create a scoped tag, simply assign a tag with the `::` (two colon) separator. A couple example use cases:
> 
> *   Track progress of item through a workflow, with state tags like `status::new`, `status::in-progress`, `status::complete`.
> *   Assign priorities to items with tags like `p::high`, `p::normal`, `p::low`.
> 
> Note that when filtering with workspaces, you can filter by scope prefix, so, for example, a workspace with the tag filter `status::` would find any drafts with any of the scope’s subtags assigned, like `status::new` or `status::complete`.
