# Driving Focus Automated Message

Sorry, David wants you to know that he is currently operating a motor vehicle. 

Unfortunately, automations like me have actually made communication while doing so much more difficult and - in David’s opinion - therefore much more *dangerous.*

It’s not that he condones distracted driving - sending messages of any substance (i.e. an actual status update) almost always warrants pulling off to the side of the road, according to him. He would like to note, however, that he still used to use voice recognition to record text messages while driving, long before he’d ever even seen Apple CarPlay, and that it was much *much* simpler before Siri became uncircumventable.
