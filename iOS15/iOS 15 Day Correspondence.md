# iOS 15 Day Correspondence

hey guys, just a head’s up: The Big Update has now been available for 3 hours and I haven’t seen or heard about any disastrous new new bugs. what I *have* noticed are more almost down-to-earth echoes of what I’ve been saying so urgently (read: they seem to agree with me?.)

basically, iOS 15 pretty certainly takes the crown for the most generally boring numerical update to this operating system, ever.

considering, here’s a very lukewarm but definitely comprehensive review before I actually send you what I wrote lol https://www.theverge.com/22683681/ios-15-ipados-review-iphone-ipad-apple
