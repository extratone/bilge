# Software Thanksgiving

![Digital Leaves](https://i.snap.as/SFHmuSlu.png)

## Purposing a disciplined effort to reflect on those tech products which have remained too fair and/or too good to catch the attention of the alarmists in us, recently.

I've never been a big fan of holidays, nor do I think Thanksgiving should be a federal one, given its shitty, undebatably imperialist origins, but these opinions are entirely inconsequential. Regardless of how I feel, Thanksgiving will remain as pervasive as ever in the spaces around me, so I thought I'd change things up this year and *actually participate* in a substantial way. I did my best to travel back to a vastly less complicated self, letting all of the crud that's accumulated atop my love of computers in the past twenty years: wokeness, adtech, Obama wearing VR glasses, etc... When I thought the Native Americans were *glad*  to see white people because they gave them guns and horses and assumed people made things because good ideas were the apex of currency. When I was able to respond to new software discoveries by screwing around aimlessly without wondering if they'd been stolen entirely from a handful of talented developers lacking in the resources and know how required to protect their ideas in the face of Microsoft's ruthless *Embrace, Extend, Extinguish* crusade.

Forgive yourself for a moment and return there with me. Or perhaps somewhere else, if you need - wherever and whenever you last remember feeling genuinely enthralled with *The Future of Computers*. (Perhaps it was yesterday! If so, Gourd bless you. Never change.) Let's take ourselves back to kindergarten, before we knew anything about the rapid cyclical consolidation and monopolization within the technology industry that had already established itself as a trend, by then, when all we knew of the software we interacted with was contained within our most visceral reactions: *I like Ask Jeeves because I like red and I like Jeeves.* I vaguely remember when Google (the search engine) first broached the general awareness of my elementary school's computer lab. I'm fairly sure I even remember the sort of feelings that were elicited the first time I actually set eyes on the Google.com homepage: it looked so modern, then, compared to the rest of the web. (After two decades, it currently looks like shit.) After only a few minutes of use, it was immediately clear that Google was superior to any of the other search engines we'd been using.

This sort of encounter - with a service that significantly alters one's perception of a given set of tasks - is precious in our lives as users. A few from my own life: first witnessing a Skype call, using the Evernote beta in Junior High, the first time I used Bandcamp's backend publishing software to edit metadata and package an album, Discord's first public release, discovering Markdown, and most recently, exploring Notion. The atmosphere of elation about the future on which I so often lament has been replaced by wariness for most of us - from Californian software developers to tractor-hacking farmers. Now, the conversation is saturated with CEO appearances before legal committees, corporate memo leaks, and somber interviews. Of course, I have contributed my share. In fact, I wish I could be twice as critical in twice the written volume, and [I believe](https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/1329078973691695117) the tech media industry to be far too culturally-embedded within Silicon Valley to be nearly critical enough. For this holiday, though, I think a respite from the negative is worthwhile and essential. I know it is for *my* personal sanity, at least.

A week ago, I shared [this Google Form](https://bit.ly/softthank) and asked you to reflect with me on the "really great" software/services *you* have encountered in your using life built by "technology companies who's business ethics align toward the benefit of us users and who's products are well-priced (or free!)"

## THANK

### 1. Bandcamp

Yes, I have tirelessly promoted [my essay about Bandcamp's holiness](https://bilge.world/bandcamp-streaming-music) for years now, but I have done so with good reason: here is a for-profit technology company which is building a one-of-a-kind product that is 

> Over the course of this super link-laden journey, we’d consider the alarmingly hypocritical possibility that it’s been overlooked by mainstream conversations only because it has so long operated in the precise manner we claim is so hopelessly absent from its neighbors in its deliberate, principled, and innovative journey towards a transparent, progressive vision.

### 2. OBS



### 3. Typora



### 4. GIMP



### 5. Audacity

I was browsing some FOSS-related article aggregation page a few weeks ago when a post caught my eye: "[Audacity exceeds 100 million downloads](https://blog.fosshub.com/audacity-exceeds-100-million-downloads/)." In reflection, I realized in that moment that perhaps no other single piece of software has been so thoroughly present in my "workflows" across all sorts of projects through the years, largely because of its God-sent [Truncate Silence feature](https://manual.audacityteam.org/man/truncate_silence.html), which I have used to remove silence from audio files for as long as I've been working within the medium, basically. Every podcast episode I have ever published has passed through Audacity for this reason and others, as have voiceovers, high school punk band demo tapes, personal voice notes, and more.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">the world would actually be perfect if audacity&#39;s truncate silence feature could be autotied to video timecodes.</p>&mdash; David Blue (@NeoYokel) <a href="https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/766786796898357248?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 19, 2016</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Until OBS came along, Audacity was where all recorded audio started for myself and my creative friends. It was Audacity that captured (and caused, technically) the [death of my friend's soundcard in audio form](https://clyp.it/ycvt1wij) during the recording process for [*Hamura*](https://ihadtopee.bandcamp.com/album/hamura), the first Drywall album, back in October of 2011.

Fucking around in Audacity through the years has led to some halfway creative results on my part, including ["SLOWED 'N' THROWED" Hilary Duff tracks](https://soundcloud.com/digivoid/hilary-duff-with-love-slowed-n-throwed) and [legacy Windows sounds remixes](https://soundcloud.com/chordoslut/windows-operatic). I still use it for every episode of [*End User*](https://anchor.fm/davidblue) and have recently created a macro for remastering [*Drycast*](https://anchor.fm/drycast) episodes. (A big feat for me and reflective of Audacity's ingenuity.) As far as I know, there are *zero* competitors, proprietary or not, which can replicate Audacity's particular usefulness as an audio utility.

### 6. NeoCities

Last week, I moved my inactive automotive blog ([dieselgoth.com](https://dieselgoth.com)) from a Writeas blog to a purely-HTML [NeoCities website](https://neocities.org/site/dieselgoth) with disturbingly little friction. (I challenge you to spot any differences.) After discovering a backup of the original Drywall Website in my archives, NeoCities was the only reasonable host on which to [archive it](https://iowa.neocities.org/).
