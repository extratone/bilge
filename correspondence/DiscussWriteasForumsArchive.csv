"Removing ""Post Unpublished by Author"" Post",Help,No,"I realize this is going to seem fishy but I promise it's actually just extremely idiotic of me...

So I received a pretty standard phishing/spam/threatening email and I thought it would be interesting to see what happened if I forwarded it to [my blog](http://extratone.com)'s publish-by-email address... Somehow, I ended up pinning it to my menu. 
![Screenshot_2019-07-13%20Extratone|690x186](upload://tBd1ZEOvjPYm1XDuv3kqDD30KFq.png)

But when I try to actually navigate to[that hyperlink](https://extratone.com/your-account-was-under-attack-change-your-access-data) to unpin/delete it, I receive the standard ""post unpublished by author"" prompt.

If there's any way to delete this image, I promise I will never fool around again for the rest of my life...

Word/Character Count Limit for Letters?,Help,No,"I've noticed that some of my longer posts have not shown up in my inbox (I'm subscribed to my own Letters to see how they appear to readers) and I was wondering if there is a set word/character count limit for posts being sent out with the feature. Obviously, it's totally understandable if there is, but it'd be nice to know the number going forward.

Word/Character Count Limit for Letters?,Help,No,"_Another update_: 

I think I realized the problem. Part of my Writeas workflow has always involved using **scheduled posts** as a method of previewing how a post is going to look on the site as I’m composing. In the past (namely, in the post I was referring to originally in this thread and others,) I had used the same post as the final, published one, by changing the date from some point in the distant future to the current time.

It didn’t occur to me until just recently that this could be very confusing for the site’s backend, so I’ve been making an effort to **create a new post at the point I’m ready to publish** and deleting the scheduled draft. Since, I’ve had absolutely zero issues with new posts arriving in my inbox.

Markdown inconsistencies and markdown flavour,Feedback,No,"I've been exploring different Markdown variations recently and had a thought on this very vein.

Would you consider publishing WriteFreely's default combination of Markdown support as **a new Markdown Syntax**? (How about *WriteDown*? lol)

It doesn't seem to require all that much documentation - just a spec sheet, which I think (could be wrong) would function as a solution to what we're talking about here.

I know personally I would much rather work around your implementation than try to modify WriteFreely myself - I just need to see that spec sheet. :eyes:",0,0,https://discuss.write.as/t/markdown-inconsistencies-and-markdown-flavour/750/9,2021-05-03T20:05:51.967Z
Add pictures to email publishing,Help,No,"Are y'all talking about embedding image *files* within an email? As far as I understand email, technically, that sounds like it would be a nightmare. 

If I may, as someone who uses my phone to compose/edit/publish as often as I use my desktop, I'd ask you to reevaluate the snap.as workflow just one more time...

To be honest, I thought the separation of the image service was really strange and janky when I first started using Write.as but I absolutely LOVE it now. It has made me so much more efficient, *especially* on mobile. 

Instead of trying to explain any further, I just uploaded [a quick video of the process to Imgur](https://imgur.com/gallery/RkPG9qw).

(The icon I used is a Siri Shortcut that just opens snap.as in a new tab in Chrome.) Uploading an image to a specific gallery, naming it, copying the md code, and returning all took less than 50 seconds. *Most of the time* it takes even less when I'm actually *in the zone*.",0,0,https://discuss.write.as/t/add-pictures-to-email-publishing/2777/3,2021-05-04T03:06:17.953Z
Write.as/WriteFreely Community Discord!,General,No,"Hello, Community!

I'm here to pull the trigger on the Discord server I've wanted to create with you for just about as long as I've been around. This project [means a lot to me](https://write.as/community/chat-with-david-blue) and I'd like to contribute in a substantial way. 

I also know that I'm almost certainly going to need help doing so, so the primary purpose of this first post is to ask that anyone interested in moderating/administrating/otherwise contributing please contact me here, via [Email](mailto:davidblue@extratone.com), or even by phone if you'd like: +1 (573) 823-4380.

My apologies if you came to this post looking for an invite... It shouldn't be very long at all (as in, two weeks at most.) In establishing this buffer period, I am working to avoid the common mistake (which I have made) of distributing invites to a space which is still being configured.

If you have absolutely no idea what I'm talking about, Discord themselves have published [a handy landing page](https://discord.com/open-source) about their platform as a collaborative space for open source communities.

If you're familiar with Slack, I wrote [a brief explanation](https://bilge.world/discord-slack-comparison) of why I chose to use Discord in its place for my little media company.

For the record, I want to do this with as close to *zero* labor required from the team as possible. I intend to contribute as much or as little as the community decides I should. 

(Also, I did run this by Matt today, if you were wondering.)

I hope to hear from you soon! Thank you!",1,0,https://discuss.write.as/t/write-as-writefreely-community-discord/2831/1,2021-05-04T17:10:56.805Z
New: Snap.as API,Announcements,No,"## Some development ideas I probably shouldn’t pursue:

1. I’ve been fantasizing about being the one to establish an integration between Typora and Snapas via Typora’s “[custom image uploader](https://support.typora.io/Upload-Image/#upload-automatically-when-insert-images)” option. 
2. A Siri Shortcut/library of Shortcut actions for interacting with the Snapas API in conjunction with the enhancements provided by [Toolbox Pro](https://www.macstories.net/reviews/toolbox-pro-review-a-must-have-companion-utility-for-shortcuts-power-users/).
3. A Drafts [Action](https://docs.getdrafts.com/actions/) and or [Action Group](https://docs.getdrafts.com/docs/actions/action-groups) which utilizes both writeas and snapas API integrations to make publishing on iOS/MacOS _dangerously seemless_ for powerusers…

That’s the thing - working _around_ the limitations of this suite has demonstrably simplified my life (as I wrote about, unsolicited, in my reply to [this thread](https://discuss.write.as/t/add-pictures-to-email-publishing/2777/3).) Also, I am just hopeless when it comes to understanding APIs… 

If any other users would benefit substantially from the effort, I’d really like to know. And of course if any *real* developers would like to “steal” one, I would love & benefit from that lol",1,0,https://discuss.write.as/t/new-snap-as-api/2652/5,2021-05-05T13:13:55.779Z
