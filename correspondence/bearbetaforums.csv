Feature Suggestion: Locking Changes,Feedback,No,"Hello all. I’m posting this here after realizing I should have done so first/instead of posting [a thread in the Subreddit about it](https://www.reddit.com/r/bearapp/comments/ldl4gq/feature_suggestion_locking_changes) yesterday...

As I said, there, it would appear that Bear’s development history has been sprinkled with folks asking for some functionality (in my case, a single toggle switch would do the trick) allowing one to “lock” content from unwanted/accidental changes. I didn’t see such a request on this forum, yet, so here it is, formally! (Apologies if I missed.)

Thanks for *Bear*ing with me... ha....ha.",2,0,https://beta.bear.app/t/feature-suggestion-locking-changes/1047/1,2021-02-06T09:44:58.135Z
Find Within Individual Notes on iOS,Feedback,No,"I realize that Bear is not intended for longform composition, but that's how I've ended up using it (quite happily!) for several years, now. I almost exclusively use it on my iPhone with a paired bluetooth keyboard, which I've come to realize to be exceedingly rare among iPhone users (if you're another iPhone-bluetooth keyboard user, _please_ [reach out to me](mailto:davidblue@extratone.com) - I'm working on a project that should benefit you immensely.) 

One of the feature additions that would be personally-beneficial would be the ability to **find** (and replace, for that matter) **text within an individual note**, _especially_ if a corresponding ⌘ + F keyboard shortcut were added.

Apologies if this has been requested before - I didn't see any recent mention of it, here, but I would understand if this post were removed/deprioritized for relevancy's sake. 

Thanks again!",2,0,https://beta.bear.app/t/find-within-individual-notes-on-ios/1458/1,2021-03-24T07:07:07.567Z
The default image insert action,Feedback,No,"_I’m gonna be pretty strong on this one because I’m confident that I’m speaking for most users,  so if I’m not, I’d appreciate users’ response to this thread even more than usual._

Regarding the button to insert an image into a note, I’d ask that you guys take a second to consider your own workflows: **how many of the images in your various notes were actually captured and embedded _from within Bear_?**

Honestly, were I developing a notetaking app, I don’t think it would even occur to me to add a _capture image now_ button at all. While I have certainly done so in the very early days of Day One, I do not consider it a rational or advantageous function, whatsoever, and I knew it immediately even way back then. Especially considering the complexity of the camera app, now, with all of its configurable variables (as well as all the different options for physical gestures to open it.)

To **clarify my proposed alternative**: having the Insert from Photo Library button on “top” of its stack in the new menu so that one needn’t long press to insert an image from their photo library.
(I suspect others use it the _least_, in fact, so I would even go so far as too suggest that it should be _last_ behind Insert Image from File, but I’m not quite as confident when it comes to the average user in that addendum.)

Imo, this is actually a great opportunity to once again demonstrate just how thoughtful I know Bear’s UX authorities must be - that immediately obvious truth that it was built by people who actually use it hehe.

Once again: if this comes across as off-target to anyone, I’d very much appreciate pushback. 

Thanks for your time :)",1,0,https://beta.bear.app/t/the-default-image-insert-action/1523/1,2021-04-04T16:22:19.962Z
The default image insert action,Feedback,No,"[quote=""Arbalest, post:2, topic:1523""]
I arrive in field to a location with my iPhone, jot a few notes, and take pictures in app. At any one site, I’ll take 5-10 photos and annotate notes about each individual artifact and or structure… I’m looking at old things, like 1,800 to 4000+ years old. Then I go home to my iPad, which actually is in my backpack the whole time I’m out, and sit down to research some of the objects further, typing notes into Bear
[/quote]

This is so fascinating and beautiful to imagine!

I am so inexpressibly thankful you took the time you did (and I know it takes time and energy!) to break down where I could have done a lot better, here. I think there's more insight about bad habits in my feedback in a single paragraph of yours than I've found in months (...years?) of thinking on it, myself. I think I'm gonna make a new habit of re-reading it before every feedback submission, generally.

(Yet again, this community has ended up doing *me* a favor lol)

Regarding the **iPhone x Bluetooth Keyboard Guide** , I'm trying to be as deliberate and socially-effective as I can from step 1, which means concentrating on exploring connections with other users and developers (like this one!)

On that note, I just converted the original Issue on my blog's GitHub Repo into [ **a new Discussion thread** ](https://github.com/extratone/bilge/discussions/93), which seems to me like an ideal gathering place for now.

(Hopefully, I've configured it correctly for public replies.)

Thank you again... I owe you.",1,1,https://beta.bear.app/t/the-default-image-insert-action/1523/4,2021-04-05T08:27:37.259Z
RE: The default image insert action,-,Yes,Thanks again! Regarding the Magic Keyboard you mentioned: I was given [the keypad-equipped one](Magic Keyboard with Numeric Keypad - US English - Space Gray  https://store.apple.com/xc/product/MRMH2LL/A) in January and have found it absolutely astonishing. Literally only charged it once since then hehe.,0,0,https://beta.bear.app/t/re-the-default-image-insert-action/1573/1,2021-04-12T22:33:09.708Z
Embed YouTube Videos,Feedback,No,"Hello all,

I’d just like to chime in with some pushback on this idea:
Bear is very special to me - as someone who considers messing around with writing/text editing/word processing software a _hobby_, of sorts - in that it has remained the single space in which I can compose without distractions. I’ve opined here on the forums and on the subreddit about why this is, but it definitely has something to do with **its limitations**. In no other case would I argue that a lack of features to be anything but _a lack of features_, but in Bear’s case, I legitimately believe _I_ would benefit if advanced embeds were continued to be left to those other editors. I’m not sure if this means anything for anyone else, but I know in my case, I will most certainly find myself messing around with embeds long before it makes sense (when I should be composing.) I would also argue that Shinyfrog’s extremely deliberate process when adding features like this is the reason why Bear has continued to be so “snappy.”

In the case of YouTube embeds, specifically, I would caution against asking the Bear team to address an issue that is fundamentally on YouTube’s end - their refusal to support PiP/background play for free users.

_That said_, I would argue that an educator’s benefit be prioritized over mine, any day. :grinning:",1,0,https://beta.bear.app/t/embed-youtube-videos/1450/5,2021-04-20T15:20:19.180Z
RE: The default image insert action,-,Yes,"One more, sorry...

I just put out my first [call for collaborators](https://dev.to/davidblue/embarking-upon-the-journey-to-write-the-definitive-guide-for-using-an-iphone-with-a-bluetooth-keyboard-4pmk) on the iPhone x Bluetooth Keyboard guide.
