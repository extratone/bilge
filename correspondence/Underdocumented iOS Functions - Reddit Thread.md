# Underdocumented iOS Functions (Stuff you wish someone had told you how to do a long time ago)

Howdy folks. I realized the other day that I have just stumbled upon so many of the most basic functions I use in iOS. Stuff like showing timestamps in iMessage (swipe right-to-left on a conversation) needs to be more obvious to the average user, imo.

Anyway, I’m working on a list of stuff I wish I knew how to do in iOS long ago and I was hoping some of you might have ideas to contribute.

Thank you!

- You can tap on the top status bar (time or wifi/cell/battery) to scroll back to the top of a webpage, app, or whatever. Really usually. Although sometimes you do it by mistake hehe but very useful! ⏤ by *Epickid976* (↑ 35/ ↓ 0)

	- I was astonished to discover this just a few weeks ago, as I am definitely the owner’s manual-reading type and have been using iOS since the very beginning. I just wish there was a way to access it outside of the Books app (tried to convert it to a PDF with no luck.) ⏤ by *AsphaltApostle* (↑ 4/ ↓ 0)

	- I don’t need to specifically press the spacebar. Anywhere on the keyboard works. ⏤ by *flekkzo* (↑ 2/ ↓ 0)
		- Hmm. I use swipe on the iOS keyboard and it only works with the space bar for me. ⏤ by *TheBr0fessor* (↑ 4/ ↓ 0)

- I'm relatively new to iOS so I'm constantly discovering new things Coming from Android, I really missed the back button in the bottom nav, and in iOS I hate having to tap on the back arrow on the top left part of the screen. Things got a little better when  I learned that when an app is using horizontal screen transitions, you can swipe from the rightmost part of the screen to the left to achieve the same thing.

Another thing I learned was swiping down on the homescreen to bring up a search field, where you can search for apps, settings, see siri suggested apps, search the web, and more. This was a total game changer for me. ⏤ by *Jkirpalani* (↑ 3/ ↓ 0)

- Kind of an odd one but if you go in the share sheet and hold an app, it’ll say “Share with app”. But I have yet to find a nifty use case for this since it seems to provide the exact same functionality as just tapping it. 

Also in the share sheet, though, you can tap and hold on a suggested contact which will bring up a “Suggest Less” option — which is obviously more useful in comparison.
