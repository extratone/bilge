# RE: "How far have you gone for internet access?"

[How far have you gone for internet access? - The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/15/22434809/internet-broadband-high-speed-access-verge-stories-infrastructure)

Having grown up on a farm parallel to the cellular phone's adoption in the rural Midwest, I have so many anecdotes and bits that I considered compiling it into a sort of *Mythology* a few years ago, when I lived for most of a Summer in the basement of a suburban Portland house owned by two Nissan Leaf-type old white professors who were themselves sharing their neighbor's wifi (an IBM employee who would not share with my partner and I.)

It was incredibly eye-opening, actually, having to fight for enough of a hotspot connection just to pass the default timeouts of most apps. I feel like I gained some worthwhile perspective on my own data gluttony that I plan to cling on to as 5G-ish excess continues to multiply more than I could've imagined just 3 years ago.

And here's a pretty big chunk of the meat:

I remember standing on top of a John Deere combine's 15ft-high roof in order to successfully make a telephone call 10 years ago - one of thousands of behaviors which were more abruptly and universally required for a few years and subsequently more abruptly forgotten than any other such united tick in American history. This blip of shared technological adversity also led to an unfathomably vast collective mythology surrounding incredibly tedious manipulation of our archaic handsets in varying degrees of desperation for *just one bar*.

My Sprint plan includes unlimited 4G LTE data for my iPhone 8 Plus with a 10GB tethering limit - which performed so admirably in the lonely role of my thin tether to the rest of the world that I am obligated to actually use the phrase ***like a champ***, but the quality of its connection is dramatically impacted by the studio apartment's depth. From the space's geometric center at stomach-level, the handset indicates "1x," meaning CDMA 1x, which *is* technically a data connection, but certainly not in any usable sense for the network applications of 2018\. The native Twitter app, Apple Mail, Snapchat, Instagram & Facebook, Safari, Opera Mini, Firefox, Chrome, and all others I tested in this condition would simply timeout – giving up after a minute or two of repeated attempts before declining to continue, each in their own minor variations. An interesting anecdote: in a pertinent reflection our human ballooning expectations for connectivity at all times, the language of our creations across both iOS and desktop applications has recently become noticeably less accountable and more accusatory. Instead of saying “____ can’t connect to the internet,” many of the browsers will declare an absolute: *three is no internet connection*, or just straight up **blame** the user: “*you* are not connected to the internet." (Emphasis mine.) No apologies... No regrets.
