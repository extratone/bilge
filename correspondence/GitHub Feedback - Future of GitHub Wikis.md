I've been sitting on this question long enough, I hope (and doing a not-insignificant amount of searching the web,) that I'm fairly sure it isn't redundant. If I'm wrong about that, sincere apologies.

GitHub's feature rollouts in the past year have been absolutely incredible, but it's felt like Wikis - as in [Repository Wikis](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/documenting-your-project-with-wikis/about-wikis) - have been more or less abadoned? What I'm asking, really, is whether or not we should anticipate a significant **update**, a **sunsetting**, or neither, going forward, for GitHub Wikis.
