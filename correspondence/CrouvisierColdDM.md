Emmanuel,

I'm reaching out because I just came across this repo (https://github.com/emcro/SwiftUI-Keyboard-Demo) and it seems like it could be a lifesaver for the project I've just embarked upon recently - that is, writing the definitive reference guide to using a Bluetooth keyboard with iPhone, specifically. I'm still struggling with my elevator pitch, if you will, but here's the post I shared on dev.to, if you're at all interested: https://dev.to/davidblue/embarking-upon-the-journey-to-write-the-definitive-guide-for-using-an-iphone-with-a-bluetooth-keyboard-4pmk

I'm trying to make this a collaborative project in the sole interest of producing something that's of the upmost value to end users... And frankly, I am not a developer nor am I naturally the sort of person who produces thorough documentation. 

In the repo's readme I read some of your thoughts that definitely echo some of my own regarding the need for documentation on this - so if you'd have the interest/time/energy/etc to collaborate on it (or frankly just to share any thoughts you have,) we'd be very exited. ("We" being myself and another iOS poweruser who has been using hardware keyboards with smartphone-esque devices since the mid-90s, so far.)

However, we would understand completely if well... it doesn't sound like fun lol. No pressure.

I do have one more question: since you've retained your creative rights to the demo according to the documentation, I was wondering if you'd be willing to give your formal-ish opinion for us to use/modify/maybe even publish some source code from it in the final product. On this, too, we will of course understand if the answer is no.

So sorry for the text wall! I'm gonna stop talking for now but thanks for your time!
