"Removing ""Post Unpublished by Author"" Post",Help,No,"I realize this is going to seem fishy but I promise it's actually just extremely idiotic of me...

So I received a pretty standard phishing/spam/threatening email and I thought it would be interesting to see what happened if I forwarded it to [my blog](http://extratone.com)'s publish-by-email address... Somehow, I ended up pinning it to my menu.

Markdown inconsistencies and markdown flavour,Feedback,No,"I've been exploring different Markdown variations recently and had a thought on this very vein.

Would you consider publishing WriteFreely's default combination of Markdown support as **a new Markdown Syntax**? (How about *WriteDown*? lol)

It doesn't seem to require all that much documentation - just a spec sheet, which I think (could be wrong) would function as a solution to what we're talking about here.

I know personally I would much rather work around your implementation than try to modify WriteFreely myself - I just need to see that spec sheet. :eyes:",0,1,https://discuss.write.as/t/markdown-inconsistencies-and-markdown-flavour/750/9,2021-05-03T20:05:51.967Z
Add pictures to email publishing,Help,No,"Are y'all talking about embedding image *files* within an email? As far as I understand email, technically, that sounds like it would be a nightmare. 

If I may, as someone who uses my phone to compose/edit/publish as often as I use my desktop, I'd ask you to reevaluate the snap.as workflow just one more time...

To be honest, I thought the separation of the image service was really strange and janky when I first started using Write.as but I absolutely LOVE it now. It has made me so much more efficient, *especially* on mobile. 

Instead of trying to explain any further, I just uploaded [a quick video of the process to Imgur](https://imgur.com/gallery/RkPG9qw).

(The icon I used is a Siri Shortcut that just opens snap.as in a new tab in Chrome.)

Write.as/WriteFreely Community Discord!,General,No,"Hello, Community!

I'm here to pull the trigger on the Discord server I've wanted to create with you for just about as long as I've been around. This project [means a lot to me](https://write.as/community/chat-with-david-blue) and I'd like to contribute in a substantial way. 

I also know that I'm almost certainly going to need help doing so, so the primary purpose of this first post is to ask that anyone interested in moderating/administrating/otherwise contributing please contact me here, via [Email](mailto:davidblue@extratone.com), or even by phone if you'd like: +1 (573) 823-4380.

My apologies if you came to this post looking for an invite... It shouldn't be very long at all (as in, two weeks at most.) In establishing this buffer period, I am working to avoid the common mistake (which I have made) of distributing invites to a space which is still being configured.

If you have absolutely no idea what I'm talking about, Discord themselves have published [a handy landing page](https://discord.com/open-source) about their platform as a collaborative space for open source communities.

If you're familiar with Slack, I wrote [a brief explanation](https://bilge.world/discord-slack-comparison) of why I chose to use Discord in its place for my little media company.

For the record, I want to do this with as close to *zero* labor required from the team as possible. I intend to contribute as much or as little as the community decides I should. 

(Also, I did run this by Matt today, if you were wondering.)

I hope to hear from you soon! Thank you!",3,0,https://discuss.write.as/t/write-as-writefreely-community-discord/2831/1,2021-05-04T17:10:56.805Z
New: Snap.as API,Announcements,No,"## Some development ideas I probably shouldn’t pursue:

1. I’ve been fantasizing about being the one to establish an integration between Typora and Snapas via Typora’s “[custom image uploader](https://support.typora.io/Upload-Image/#upload-automatically-when-insert-images)” option. 
2. A Siri Shortcut/library of Shortcut actions for interacting with the Snapas API in conjunction with the enhancements provided by [Toolbox Pro](https://www.macstories.net/reviews/toolbox-pro-review-a-must-have-companion-utility-for-shortcuts-power-users/).
3. A Drafts [Action](https://docs.getdrafts.com/actions/) and or [Action Group](https://docs.getdrafts.com/docs/actions/action-groups) which utilizes both writeas and snapas API integrations to make publishing on iOS/MacOS _dangerously seemless_ for powerusers…

That’s the thing - working _around_ the limitations of this suite has demonstrably simplified my life (as I wrote about, unsolicited, in my reply to [this thread](https://discuss.write.as/t/add-pictures-to-email-publishing/2777/3).) Also, I am just hopeless when it comes to understanding APIs… 

If any other users would benefit substantially from the effort, I’d really like to know. And of course if any *real* developers would like to “steal” one, I would love & benefit from that lol",1,0,https://discuss.write.as/t/new-snap-as-api/2652/5,2021-05-05T13:13:55.779Z

Consideration: Formal Press Kit/Brand Guidelines,General,No,"I know it probably seems like the least relevant thing possible for you devs, right now, but I was wondering/hoping you might be interested in establishing a formal “brand guidelines” page for the whole organization and/or having a conversation about how you would like me to refer to the company, the community, to WriteFreely the CMS, WriteFreely the iOS application, Write.as the service, etc. when writing, tweeting, and/or just talking about them with potential new clients.

I would also like to offer my (free) services/assistance with this. I’ve developed quite a habit of “collecting” brand and press kits over the years… [Holy crap I just actually counted for the first time and it is over 500 directories… Jez.] So, while I’ve never been employed as a marketing person and generally find the whole practice quite foul, usually, I certainly should (*theoretically*) be familiar enough with professional branding to whip up something that is both ultra-pro and yet still distinctly and intimately *of the values* I know this organization holds.

**BUT**… Wouldn’t it be even cooler if we sortof all did it together, here? Lots of ideas on all of this, but yeah.

For now, I’d just like to know how the team feels about this. If it’s something you’d rather have an actual **ultra-pro leverager brandy man** do, please trust me when I insist that my feelings will not be hurt.
