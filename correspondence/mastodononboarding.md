There are!! 
* [Documentation on joinmastodon.org](https://docs.joinmastodon.org/)
* NoÃ«lle Anthony's [**Guide To Mastodon**](https://github.com/joyeusenoelle/GuideToMastodon) - (If you're allergic to GitHub, I just put [an HTML render of the guide on my NeoCities](https://davidblue.xyz/gtm/).)

You can also [**hit me up**](https://linktr.ee/davidblue) any time with questions. I am not an authority on Mastodon, but I am very much personally invested in its growth, so I'm not exaggerating when I say... give me a telephone call if you'd like! +1 (573) 823-4380
