I first posted a comment somewhere on this forum many months ago mentioning the possibility of using ~~Siri~~ “Apple Shortcuts” to automate interactions with Write.as/Snap.as via the API and I’ve now *finally* begun actually manifesting this, myself.

So far, I’ve published just two:

- [**Authenticate with WriteFreely**](https://routinehub.co/shortcut/11589)
Just helps one retrieve an auth token (which can be used for both Write.as and Snap.as.)

- [**Snap.as Upload**](https://routinehub.co/shortcut/11616)
Using said token, this one uploads images (one at a time) to Snap.as and outputs the embed URL. (Ex: `https://i.snap.as/pb8H9CCx.png`)

Here’s [a brief video demo](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43663476/164028154-b5b469ff-3ecd-4c96-9540-1c19961e46ce.MOV) of the latter as I’ve configured it from within Drafts.

I wanted to establish this thread both so I can continue to share shortcuts as I publish them and of course, to hear from you, whether that be feedback, requests, general bereavement, etc.
