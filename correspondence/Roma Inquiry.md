## Subject: Roma=Mast+Whalebird??

Hello!

First, I hope you do not interpret this message with any sort of hostile intention. I'm genuinely just curious.

I've been writing a comparison of Mastodon apps on iOS for the past few weeks and I noticed that Roma appears to be the very same application which used to be called Mast. I DMed Mast's developer about it but haven't heard back. I also just noticed the same thing about the Roma desktop application - except that it appears virtually identical to Whalebird.

I have absolutely zero desire to have any negative impact on the federated social community at all with my app guide, but this sortof thing is hard not to mention. If you'd be willing to share any details about the story, I'd love it if you'd reach out.

Thanks for your time!
