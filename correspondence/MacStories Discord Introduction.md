# MacStories Discord Introduction

Howdy folks! 

I'm David Blue, once an automotive journalist, now a self-proclaimed "Software Historian," and I've had the bizarre experience of watching iPhone, specifically, go from being unrecognizable for most people (I distinctly remember people asking "what is that" of my first-generation iPhone,) to debatably the most recognizable shape in history(?) Along the way, MacStories has stood out among explicitly Apple-adjacent tech media and greater tech media, alike, as an entirely unique publication. 

((I promised to skip two Christmases in order to convince my mom to buy me a first generation iPhone at age 14. I carried it proudly in a leather belt holster to my first day of 8th grade and was *not* bullied about it, somehow.))

One anecdote you might find entertaining:

I distinctly remember reading about "the guy trying to use an iPad Air as his main computer" and thinking "utterly ridiculous! no way that's gonna work!" before I knew Federico by name. Now that I know the full story, I am even further humbled. (In my opinion, the iPad team should have a massive framed portrait of Federico in their workspace and *certainly* should refer to him by name in keynotes.)

Over the past year, I've found what I believe to be my "place" in the iOS community as one of the few iPhone users who regularly uses a Bluetooth keyboard paired with their device. This is something I've done for over ten years now, but - after discovering the practice's *accessibility* considerations, especially - I decided to write the documentation Apple is clearly not interested in writing themselves. More details can be found in the links below, but my one request of you: **if you or someone you know has ever used a physical keyboard paired with their *iPhone* for any significant amount of time, please send them my way.** I am endeavoring to create the single, centralized resource for shortcuts and other considerations that I've been looking for all this time.
