# Mastodon Feature Request: Shared/Collaborative User Lists

- [Issue](https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon/issues/18292)

## Pitch

Instance-bound (I'm assuming federation-wide implementation would be extremely difficult) shared user lists primarily associated with the creator's account. A rudimentary administrative privilege system (read-only, can add, can delete, etc.) would be ideal. Perhaps users could be offered an option to follow the list and another to *follow all users in the list*.

## Motivation

From my perspective, lists are the most powerful curatorial tool on the social web. The common obstacle for new Mastodon users in "finding accounts to follow" would be offered a substantial remedy, I believe, in public-facing shared/collaborative user lists. A view showing basic metadata about the list (description, list of collaborators) with its own permalink might offer new users significant context.
