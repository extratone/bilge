I love the diversity already represented in this thread!

hello those who don't know me - I'm [David Blue](https://davidblue.wtf/db.vcf)!

[My main blog](https://bilge.world) on write.as is entitled "*The Psalms*" (which is... a dumb Bible joke and not meant to be [actual malicious blasphemy](https://eldritch.cafe/@cantinto/106810203788514989) or anything. it's gotten very specific in the past 18 months or so, for better or worse.

I had the pleasure of [chatting with](https://write.as/community/chat-with-david-blue) former Community Manager (still [resident & excellent blogger](https://blog.cjeller.site)) CJ Eller about how discovering this platform and Markdown basically saved my life.â€¨
I was very proud to have my blog's theme [listed](https://write.as/themes/bilge) in the [official themes directory](https://write.as/themes,) though both the [CSS](https://github.com/extratone/bilge/blob/main/Custom%20CSS.css) and [JS](https://github.com/extratone/bilge/blob/main/Custom%20Javascript.js) have changed *a lot* in the time since, so I'd suggest you use those latter links if you'd like to try it. 

As a former, jaded, self-described "CMS nerd," I [believe](https://mastodon.social/@DavidBlue/107037907657070351) there is something very poignantly special about [the whole Musing Studio suite](https://musing.studio) and have become more invested than I could've ever imagined in the wellbeing of these properties. That said, I would like to offer myself as a point of contact for support in two distinct aspects:
1. **In the technical sense**, I am not a certified web developer/designer in any sense, but I'd like to think myself familiar enough with these platforms and how they interoperate to call myself an authority. If anything else, if I can't help you with your problem, I'll know where to send you.
2. As **a "soldier" for the "cause."** If you or someone you know needs convincing regarding the .as suite as a product, and you find yourself without the time/energy, [call me](https://davidblue.wtf/db.vcf)! It's in my self-interest to help it grow, and I can't actually think of a better use of my time.

It might interest you to know that *The Psalms* is "written in public" via Git and [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/extratone/bilge), which basically means that my entire process (including [this very reply](https://github.com/extratone/bilge/blob/main/correspondence/IntroduceYourselfandYourBlog.md)!) can be viewed/tracked in real time. Believe it or not, I did not know what Git was 18 months ago, and now I basically live on it. 

So excited to see growth in the community! If you'd like to chat about any of the topics I've covered - or about anything, basically - here are my contact details one last time:
