## Audio Zoom

> Another first for Apple, if not for the world of smartphones, is Audio Zoom. The feature supposedly helps you zero in on the subject you’re filming, and reject unwanted background noise. This could be helpful if you’re filming in noisy environments.
> The main technology behind audio zoom is called beamforming, or spatial filtering. It allows changing an audio recording’s directivity (that is, the sensitivity according to the direction of the sound source) and shape it in any way necessary. In this case, the optimal directivity is a hypercardioid pattern (see illustration below), which enhances sounds coming from the front direction — that is, from the direction in which your camera is pointed — while attenuating sounds from all other directions (your background noise).
