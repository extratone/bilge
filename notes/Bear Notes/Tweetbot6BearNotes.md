- [ ] In terms of reliability/bugs, I can say with 100% honesty that Tweetbot 6 has been more reliable than the native Twitter app in the past week or so.

### From Hand Notes
- [ ] 1st version release date (both on MacOS and iOS)
- [ ] Reviews of older versions
- [ ] More extensive search for Lists discourse
- [ ] App footprint size vs. the native app. -> 10.9MB vs. 115.8MB
- [ ] A bullet list summary of the API changes Twitter Blog post compared in a graphic(?) with any/all public statements/hints from Tapbots regarding specific feature additions relating to API changes.

#### Possible Interview Questions
- [ ] Reasoning behind such investment in lists - 2021 vs. first year of development
- [ ] Notable events/correspondence from Twitter - both public and otherwise
- [ ] Stuff you feel Twitter may have been “inspired” by Tweetbot to include in the native app (like keyboard shortcuts.)
- [ ] Most unusual feature requests from users.

> Twitter is a vaguely terrible way to spend your time these days, but if you (like me) can’t tear yourself away from the social media service / entryway into hell, you’ll want Tweetbot, which actually makes using Twitter far less painful. Tweetbot shows you the tweets of the people you follow, in the order that they tweeted them. There are no ads or promoted tweets, powerful mute filters to block out unwanted noise, and (thanks to Twitter’s unfriendly API changes) no notifications to constantly ping you to come back to the app.

## The Subscription Issue

> The subscription “backlash” hasn’t been anywhere near as bad as I thought it’d be. Pretty sure the last time we did a paid upgrade (you know in 20 freaking 15) it was quite a bit worse.
