# Native Software (iOS 14)
[[iOS 14 Review Notes]]
## Siri, Discreet Idiot
Siri Shortcuts are essentially associated with Apple’s personal assistent only in name, but she does still have a particular value you may or may not have considered: if you’re the sort to worry about your “privacy” in 2021, Siri is [the most discreet voice assistent available](https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/29/20837077/apple-siri-privacy-opt-out-voice-human-grading-review), by far. Of course, this also makes her the definitive *worst* in functional terms, yet she remains the only one which has added (albeit diminutive) value to my own life. The “disable all alarms” command - while it should probably exist on its own in the native Clocks app - is a particularly useful function. 

- [ ] I actually witnessed a 20-year-old, well-adjusted young woman in the wild use Hey Siri to make a call, yesterday.

In my iPhone 8 Plus review, I noted:
> ...frankly, I can’t imagine looking at the  [gluttonous](http://www.extratone.com/audio/futureland/toomanymessengers/)  palate of available mobile, cross-platform messaging services (Telegram,  [now Telegram X](https://telegram.org/blog/telegram-x) , WhatsApp, Signal, Snapchat, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Discord, Slack, Tinder?, Google Hangouts, Google Allo, Google Chat, Viber, Skype, Line, Wire, etc.) and thinking… well, none of this will do!  
Several of these are either defunct or scandalized, in the present, though Telegram, especially, [has been thriving](https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22253918/telegram-ios-chat-history-import-whatsapp-line-kakaotalk).

- [ ] Fonts?
- [ ] As with many iOS feature additions, these days, **Widgets** seem in large part to address a problem which Apple made for themselves by removing some other, much-less-complex function from the operating system. I’ve no idea why they would choose to remove the percentage readout from the top of the iPhone’s screen on newer models, but at least one can reclaim them, sort of, by placing a quarter-sized battery widget on their homescreen.
- [ ] It’s bizarre that Microsoft’s Outlook has unequivocally surpassed iOS’ native Mail app in the ratings. This... I could literally *never* have predicted.
- [ ] CarPlay themes! Nice…
