I personally hate that question because, you know… it just will get done when it gets done… We’re definitely slow. We go over every screen, every detail over and over again until we get it right. That takes time, which is why we don’t talk about upcoming projects.

The app I have the most experience with a Tweetbot and you've given me a whole new love for Twitter that I never knew was there I'm at I really do you know will assess later on and on your website you say you're not moving to other platforms but I've had so much love to see a Mac up for T-ball and I just pray that like when I ask you to supersede your question that's what you talk about math I'm in love with I know you can actually have a love affair with an application or a piece of offer but you have done an awesome job with Tweetbot.

> Thank you thank you yeah we probably won't be talking about any super secret project not so much because we don't want to give anything away but because if we do talk about whatever supersecret projects we have going on and people continuously ask us when it's going to be done and I personally hate that question because you know I will just will get done when it gets done and so will probably not talk much about you know what we got going on but it will be interesting else I'll say that I do love that the part on your website where you say a little bit of patience please I wanna be blunt here we're slow I just love that you're honest about that yeah no we're definitely yeah we're slow we go over every screen every detail and you know over and over again until we get it right and that takes time and that's why we don't really like to talk about upcoming projects because we honestly don't know when it's going to be done will you know will be done when it's done and that's kind of the good thing about him not being our own boss is like we don't have to we don't set deadlines and I mean we set general deadlines of like when we like it to be done but you know if somethings not done it we don't have to rush it we're gonna just keep working on until it's ready.
