### Form Description



***

1. **What cellular phone(s) are you currently using?**

> Be as specific (or not) as you feel like being. If I were taking this survey, I would probably take a second to include my phone's full model name, full model number, and other accessible details about its hardware. On iOS, the basics of this info can be found handily by going to Settings->General->About. See the image below for an example. (Even sharing your device's serial number doesn't really compromise you in any way. Just please DO NOT include its IMEI number.)
