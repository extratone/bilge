# Native Software (iOS 14)
[[iOS 14 Review Notes]]
## Siri, Discreet Idiot
Siri Shortcuts are essentially associated with Apple’s personal assistent only in name, but she does still have a particular value you may or may not have considered: if you’re the sort to worry about your “privacy” in 2021, Siri is [the most discreet voice assistent available](https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/29/20837077/apple-siri-privacy-opt-out-voice-human-grading-review), by far. Of course, this also makes her the definitive *worst* in functional terms, yet she remains the only one which has added (albeit diminutive) value to my own life. The “disable all alarms” command - while it should probably exist on its own in the native Clocks app - is a particularly useful function.
