## Capabilities
- [ ] Screen Mirroring *Real Racing 3* ([Tweet](https://twitter.com/neoyokel/status/1336812943154044928?s=21))
It seemed like a great idea to try editing photos on my mom’s newish 85” TV via Screen Mirroring, but it proved nearly impossible (or at least beyond my capabilities) to configure the television to display anything remotely resembling a *neutral image*.

- [ ] Augmented Reality ([Eggs, Inc. Tweet](https://twitter.com/neoyokel/status/1352780547404267522?s=21))
- [ ] [Creating websites in minutes on our fucking phones](https://youtu.be/BYOdugyqV34).

- [ ] I am now to the point where I’ve acquired far too many “powerful” solutions designed - not necessarily always in solitude, but often so within the market they identify themselves as in - (Bear is nothing less than a masterpiece, but Shiny Frog does seem to be a little *too* unconcerned with what other “notetaking” applications and services offer users.) It’s literally been two years since I bought Drafts and put it on my todo list to learn and... I’ve forgotten or lost everything I’d learned/configured. I’ve had (and used regularly, in my defense, but only in the laziest senses) ::Copied:: for years now, too, and am finally getting around to making some use of its handy, customizable rules for automatically sorting incoming clipboard content. And today I got around to briefly investigating and installing ::[TextExpander](https://textexpander.com)::, finally... 

- [ ] Quoting myself from a (mostly single-sided) conversation on the r/iPhone Discord:
> when I think of “transitor,” I see an image in my head of something I have manipulated with my hands many many times. something I’ve crimped and stuck in a breadboard...  
>   
> and then I just happen to catch that there are apparently **two BILLION** transistors inside this cellular telephone I’m using and uh.... yeah.
