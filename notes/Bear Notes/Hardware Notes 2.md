# Hardware Notes
- [ ] The iPhone 12 Pro Max exceeds the specs of even [my “new” desktop PC](https://bilge.world/hp-envy-desktop) in most aspects.
- [ ] iPhones are “designed to be put in a case,” nowadays, resolves Nilay Patel.
- [ ] The **Crud** issue...
[GSMArena’s Video Review](https://youtu.be/TfRtC5cQCpA) also shows crud around the lenses.
## Display
> OLED can be seen as a replacement for LCD, or liquid crystal displays. You might be reading this article on an LCD screen right now, given how ubiquitous the technology has been since its inception in the early 1960s. For reference, every iPhone before the iPhone X used LCD screens. Even the regular iPhone 11 last year used it, with the more expensive 11 Pro moving to OLED. For reference, the iPhone X and XS used OLED, too.  
> The most important functional difference between OLED and LCD that you need to know is the presence of a backlight. An OLED display uses that organic film we mentioned earlier to emit light when an electrical current runs through it. In other words, OLED can function all on its own without the need for a backlight. LCD has served humanity well for decades, but it needs a backlight to display anything.

It’s difficult to remark with much insight on the OLED display vs. the LCD unit on my iPhone 8 Plus without the latter device in my posession to physically compare, but the contrast (literally, hehe) is especially obvious when a given app’s “high contrast dark mode” is selected. While my iPhone 8 Plus review began with a note on how insignificant True Tone appeared to be, it’s worth noting that it’s certainly a significant component of the experience, now - how much the upgraded display technology factors into this change, I know not.
The Big Issue among tech media is a refresh rate complaint... the iPhone 12 Pro line’s display is limited to 60Hz, while the rest of the market’s flagship lineup pushes to 120Hz and beyond. This is not something I am equipped to comment on, but I will say that 60 frames per second has always seemed like plenty to me.

## Camera
> Front-facing 4K, 60fps capture is impressive, but useless — vloggers all have GoPros or DSLRs, these days, and sharing through Snapchat and Instagram will always be ultra-compressed.   
I am not - nor have I ever been - one of these self-described *Camera Nerds*, but it strikes ~~ me that “real” camera nerds own one or more DSLRs and would surely prefer them over their handset’s camera in nearly every situation. Obviously, though, I am 100% out of touch when it comes to The Camera Issue. Two years later, and tech media appears to be unable to stop talking about smartphone cameras. The industry, predictably, seems to have gone right along with it. Now, I have in my posession an $1100 telephone designed around its camera system, which has sent me on a similar, completely bonkers camera-testing escapaade. In my defense, the thought *I should’ve just bought a DSLR* was [stuck in my mind](https://twitter.com/neoyokel/status/1344559416968966144?s=21) throughout the lot of it.
[Camera Test Embeds]
In short, I think we’re expecting far too much out of our smartphones and would end up gaining much in the end if we stopped. Battery life, for one.
- [ ] I have been shooting RAW photos on iPhone for a while now... thanks to [Halide](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/halide-mark-ii-pro-camera/id885697368), which may or may not be completely worthless, now.

## Battery and Magnets
I am genuinely worried about the future we continue to set ourselves up for, full of spent batteries and no way to responsibly despose of them.

- [ ] I was able to drain the battery significantly faster than any tech journalists could.

- [ ] *“Two billion transistors.”*See: [[On iOS Excess]]. This is an important anecdote when talking with folks who are still genuinely flummoxed as to why headphone jacks aren’t built into iPhones anymore. 

- [ ] An in-between mode for hardware keyboards would be nice. With Full Keyboard Access turned on, highlighted areas are distracting. Without it enabled, key functions are missing. (A shortcut for Siri, Notifications View, lock/unlock, to call up the shortcuts guide per app, etc.)

- [ ] *iFixit*’s **[iPhone 12 Pro Max teardown livestream](https://youtu.be/EXjDFdNVnXo)** is probably deserving of an embed, somewhere.
