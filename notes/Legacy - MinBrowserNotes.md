  > I think the reason why the browser is so effective at its goal of minimalism is because of *how* it manages tab overload. Rather than simply letting tabs fill up, you’re encouraged to create “tasks” that let you divide different use cases up. As a writer, the way I’ve been using tasks has been to create a new one for every story I write and research, so that I can separate those ideas out without them getting in the way of everything else. (I can also hide the usual junk that sits in the pinned tabs in its own task.)

  > An overabundance of tabs is a well-established problem among those who spend their entire days combing the internet, where distraction reigns king.

- [ ] Reading view is a little slow.

- [ ] "Return to your previous task" is a lot more useful than "open where you left off."

- [ ] Browsing entirely centered around the search bar.

- [ ] It would be nice to be able to preview hyperlinks in the left-bottom corner just by hovering on them instead of having to right-click.

- [ ] Customizable hotkeys are brilliant.

- [ ] You cannot move tabs around, which supports Min's minimal tab argument.
