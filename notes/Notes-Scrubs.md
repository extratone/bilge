# Notes-Siri Shortcuts for Scrubs

## My particular use of 2-action Shortcuts called by Type-to-Siri has been made reasonable enough to demonstrate thanks to changes in iOS 15.

I think it's telling that my most used Shortcut *by far* since Summer/Fall 2018 when Shortcuts first came to iOS Beta is called "[**cut**](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/c154db1710a9473b8f0f6fb1fc275c95)." It's literally just two actions: it turns off Bluetooth completely and turns of Wi-Fi completely. The buttons in Command Center that *should* do those things don't actually disable them, which drives me absolutely bonkers lol.

Among other things, completely disabling Wi-Fi will prevent your phone from connecting to every goddamned Starbucks/McDonalds/HyVee/any other public Wi-Fi you've ever authenticated on your phone when you're driving/walking around. Basically, your data network is almost certainly *exponentially* faster and more reliable (especially if you're moving.) You probably don't need me to explain but I consider it a real safety issue especially because bouncing from one crappy hotspot to the next while you're driving will cause navigation to be unresponsive and even cause calls to drop.

Anyway, I've personally placed this in a widget at the very top of the old widget menu (in the screen you find when you swipe from left-to-right on your first homescreen.) 

As I'm sharing it with you, though, you don't need to do anything but install it and you'll be able to trigger it by saying "Hey Siri! ... Cut!"
