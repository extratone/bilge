# Notes: Social Media Documentation

* My very first Tweet was purely strategic and a blatant lie!
* Whyp is an example of a *truly thriving* audio social network!!

* Tom Critchlow is an exception! He uses adjacent terms in describing his work sometimes, but **they all lead to concrete examples**. Not sure if this will end up being the right place to not this.

* By design or not, The Ratio _fundamentally_ disincentivizes discovery, sincere exposure to new perspectives, and indeed most of what we constitute as “human connection.”

* Ultimately, I don't really have a choice but to continue using Twitter as I always have, so I'm going to make the most of it and continue to post whenever and whatever I, myself, would like to see on my timeline - even if my account ends up in such low opinion of The Twitter Algorithm that my Tweets become obfuscated entirely from everywhere on the site save for their full, canonical web addresses, which I will then publish via plain text files hosted on my NeoCities.
  * Disclose: the excerpt from [my astrology](https://www.notion.so/rotund/The-Day-of-Reformed-Precocity-1bbbb5f6369646fbae7024c3295523e4) about indiscriminately viewing my work.
  
    > Above all, those born on this day must learn patience and discrimination. Not all of their work is of the highest caliber, though they expect it to be and can firmly believe it is.
  
* **It's okay if you don't understand.** You can leave it at that.

* We have all inevitably become *sus*, which is okay, but we should be particularly mindful about it.

* Frankly, the cool broadcasts I want to hear are all from Open Web sources: [Datafruits](https://datafruits.fm/), Solarpunk.cool, etc.

* The long lost love: **Discovery**.

## Assumptions in Question

1. For the vast majority of mainstream social users, no amount of [insert vague overused marketing jargon noun] will *ever* result in a substantial accumulation of money/"influence" (which seems to be the diluted zag of "POWER" of the moment.) Those interested in learning about "marketing" should know that no authority on the subject would ever tell you to *start* with Twitter - this I can say with certainty. 
2. Though Twitter was designed upon certain frameworks with certain rules which form quantifiable formulas where they are dependent upon a user's choices/methodology to produce results which we *have*, indeed, become more adept at predicting with study over time, it was *not* created as a *game to be won*. Perhaps more importantly, the "prize" of "winning" in the sense held by those who resist this assumption (notoriety, "influence," relevance) has continued to prove ultimately worthless (or worse) time and time again throughout the very short history of the cultural element as it exists today.
3. If both 1 and 2 pass scrutiny, the only remaining reasonable prerogatives in one’s social media use is to engage with _both_ strangers and friends in a manner which generally **adds value to the lives of all involved**.
4. 3 is not only _possible_ - it is easily _reproducible_. Most of my evidence is centered around my own experiences, but I believe - if I took the time - I would be able to find infinitely many publicly-facing examples. 
5. Though I am going to use my own methods to demonstrate 4, **neither my ideas nor my behavior are the only means of interacting positively on social media**.

### Specific public examples of positively-acting individual accounts
* [Jon Male](https://twitter.com/mrjaydeeem)
* [Matt Farah](https://twitter.com/thesmokingtire) - An example of a celebrity who for the most part sticks to subjects on which he is an authority and invests a lot of intellectual and emotional energy engaging in discussion. In turn, he is also an example of someone who is *actually* “leveraging” his social media use for his business, but in a way that adds value to everybody’s lives. 


> The exchange of **information or services** among individuals, groups, or institutions.
> *Specifically*, the cultivation of **productive relationships** for employment or business.
