# Notes-Telegram

## General
* **Telegram and Discord are the same age**
* Telegram’s cross-platform, resource-frugal clients and phone number-based accounts/auth literally make it more **class mobile** than Discord.
* What in fuck is this website… “[Telegram for iOS - NONE](http://tsfkb.wikidot.com/apps:ios)”
* My [personal Telegram satellite GitHub Repository](https://github.com/extratone/t)
* [Send to Telegram Drafts Action](https://actions.getdrafts.com/a/18E)
* [r/columbiamo - Local Telegram Group Chat for Columbia](https://reddit.com/r/columbiamo/comments/c4na0v/local_telegram_group_chat_for_columbia/)
* Relative link to messages that don't involve complex scripting.
* Unlimited file upload limit - **2GB PER FILE LIMIT**.
* Cross-platform as all fuck.
* Every programming/scripting language ever has at least a few (probably unfinished and abandoned) projects in the wild building support for Telegram APIs.
* Drafts as a safe dependable space to compose text does not have a windows equivalent, but Telegram can sort of function in that regard, largely because it continuously saves what one types in the text field. 
* Element … or Matrix… or whatever the actual protocol is called… is nothing but a great way to waste your time and the planet’s energy in obfuscating willy nilly. 
* Perhaps I should have accepted long ago that my particular priorities are *not* as resonant with other users as I would like to believe.
* Notification management in Telegram as well considered as I’ve ever experienced, which makes a lot of sense now that I am a long time user.
* When I lost all my shit in Portland, much of what was saved was thanks to Telegram.
* The particular features that define Telegram’s competence are not immediately obvious, for the most part. Being able to quickly change the recipient of a forwarded message, for instance,
* Telegram is notably lacking in translation support considering it's such an international space.
* Microsoft Teams needs to be considered as an alternative since it's being so heavily emphasized for *personal use* in Windows 11.
* The **cost** of Telegram vs. Discord Nitro, now.
* [[SI on Discord Regarding Objective-C and Swift]]

> A single boost costs $4.99 a month, and any member of the Discord Server can contribute. If you’re a Discord Nitro subscriber, you get a 30% discount on all Discord Server Boost purchases. Recently, Discord introduced lower thresholds for upgrading Discord Server Levels. Before, it takes 15 server boosts to achieve Level 2, and 30 server boosts to reach Level 3. But in a recent update, it will now only take 7 server boosts to reach Level 2, and 14 boosts to reach Level 3. That’d be a total of $34.93 for Level 2 and $69.86 for Level 3. That’s $24.45 for Level 2 and $48.90 for Level 3 for Nitro subscribers.
