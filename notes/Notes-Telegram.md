# Notes-Telegram

## General
* **Telegram and Discord are the same age**
* Telegram’s cross-platform, resource-frugal clients and phone number-based accounts/auth literally make it more **class mobile** than Discord.
* What in fuck is this website… “[Telegram for iOS - NONE](http://tsfkb.wikidot.com/apps:ios)”
* My [personal Telegram satellite GitHub Repository](https://github.com/extratone/t)
* [Send to Telegram Drafts Action](https://actions.getdrafts.com/a/18E)
* [r/columbiamo - Local Telegram Group Chat for Columbia](https://reddit.com/r/columbiamo/comments/c4na0v/local_telegram_group_chat_for_columbia/)
* Relative link to messages that don't involve complex scripting.
* Unlimited file upload limit - **2GB PER FILE LIMIT**.
* Cross-platform as all fuck.
* Every programming/scripting language ever has at least a few (probably unfinished and abandoned) projects in the wild building support for Telegram APIs.
* Drafts as a safe dependable space to compose text does not have a windows equivalent, but Telegram can sort of function in that regard, largely because it continuously saves what one types in the text field. 
* Element … or Matrix… or whatever the actual protocol is called… is nothing but a great way to waste your time and the planet’s energy in obfuscating willy nilly. 
* Perhaps I should have accepted long ago that my particular priorities are *not* as resonant with other users as I would like to believe.
* Notification management in Telegram as well considered as I’ve ever experienced, which makes a lot of sense now that I am a long time user.
* When I lost all my shit in Portland, much of what was saved was thanks to Telegram.
* The particular features that define Telegram’s competence are not immediately obvious, for the most part. Being able to quickly change the recipient of a forwarded message, for instance,
* Telegram is notably lacking in translation support considering it's such an international space.

This is going to seem entirely out of left field, but for those looking for that OG function of Drafts... as just a safe place to compose text you intend to use elsewhere (as opposed to the Tweet compose interface, which just lost me like 15 minutes of typing, which led me here... hehe,) 

I have been using [**Telegram**](https://desktop.telegram.org/), of all things for years. notably, if you hit Ctrl + 0 from *anywhere* in the Windows client, you and your cursor are taken to the compose field beneath your personal "Saved Messages" channel, which is searchable, has an extremely high per-message character limit (after which it just automatically splits,) and is ridiculously reliable in saving "drafts" live as you're typing. as in... I have actively tried to lose characters by killing the application and then logging in on my phone and have yet to accomplish losing a single one (among other advantages: zero formatting added to plain text by default - not even line breaks - no total file limit and *2GB* per file limit uploads, absurdly cross-platform, literally more reliable than SMS in poor network conditions.) you can immediately reenter a sent message with `↑` to edit, copy it, escape with just `Esc` and then paste to start a new revision.

my other suggestion which I would personally use for this if I wasn't such a high-intensity clipboard user:
God's great gift to man, [**CopyQ**](https://hluk.github.io/CopyQ/,) is an extremely robust and infinitely customizable clipboard manager that supports complex scripting and.... somehow... I just managed to set up live syncing of my CopyQ clipboard over *iCloud for Windows*, and you absolutely would not believe how well it actually works.

as far as *send to yourself* functions… Telegram’s is the absolute most capable and usable by far, I promise. here’s more explanation in the form of this response I posted yesterday (I don’t expect anyone to actually engage with it though lol.) https://talk.automators.fm/t/equivalent-to-drafts-but-for-windows/6159/8
