## General
* [x] **Telegram and Discord are the same age**
* [ ] [**Isiah’s random encounter**](https://twitter.com/ammnontet/status/1449594872139186181)
* [ ] Telegram’s cross-platform, resource-frugal clients and phone number-based accounts/auth literally make it more **class mobile** than Discord.
* [ ] What in fuck is this website… “[Telegram for iOS - NONE](http://tsfkb.wikidot.com/apps:ios)”
* [ ] My [personal Telegram satellite GitHub Repository](https://github.com/extratone/t)
* [x] [Send to Telegram Drafts Action](https://actions.getdrafts.com/a/18E)
* [x] [r/columbiamo - Local Telegram Group Chat for Columbia](https://reddit.com/r/columbiamo/comments/c4na0v/local_telegram_group_chat_for_columbia/)
* [x] Relative link to messages that don't involve complex scripting.
* [x] Unlimited file upload limit - **2GB PER FILE LIMIT**.
* [x] Cross-platform as all fuck.
* [ ] Every programming/scripting language ever has at least a few (probably unfinished and abandoned) projects in the wild building support for Telegram APIs.
* [x] Drafts as a safe dependable space to compose text does not have a windows equivalent, but Telegram can sort of function in that regard, largely because it continuously saves what one types in the text field. 
* [ ] Element … or Matrix… or whatever the actual protocol is called… is nothing but a great way to waste your time and the planet’s energy in obfuscating willy nilly. 
* [ ] Perhaps I should have accepted long ago that my particular priorities are *not* as resonant with other users as I would like to believe.
* [ ] Notification management in Telegram as well considered as I’ve ever experienced, which makes a lot of sense now that I am a long time user.
* [x] When I lost all my shit in Portland, much of what was saved was thanks to Telegram.
* [ ] The particular features that define Telegram’s competence are not immediately obvious, for the most part. Being able to quickly change the recipient of a forwarded message, for instance,
* [ ] Telegram is notably lacking in translation support considering it's such an international space.
* [ ] Microsoft Teams needs to be considered as an alternative since it's being so heavily emphasized for *personal use* in Windows 11.
* [x] The **cost** of Telegram vs. Discord Nitro, now.
* [ ] [[SI on Discord Regarding Objective-C and Swift]]
* [ ] "Last seen within a week will be kicked."
* [ ] As far as I’m concerned/as far as I live, now, Telegram is a required utility for using iOS.
* [ ] The ever-greater value of the ability to [**send silent messages**](https://telegram.org/blog/channels-2-0#silent-messages).
* [ ] YouTube's pre-sharesheet sharesheet pushes to Telegram even faster than Telegram's.
* [ ]  [Anon ✪ in Telegram Desktop Talk](https://t.me/TelegramDesktopTalk/66912)
* [ ] `t.me/s`
* [ ] **Rich Text** is the fucking key when it comes to posting!!! [See:](https://t.me/extratone/7935)
* [ ] Telegram’s audio file sharing (like my bot!) could actually be *more* frugal than collective Discord listening in voice channels, especially considering how they’re treated as a playlist (with a customizable and recently-redesigned audio player) within *channels*, at least.

## Anecdotes

* [ ] Static location sharing just sends a Lat-Long Google Maps URL: `https://maps.google.com/maps?q=38.934018,-92.388035&ll=38.934018,-92.388035&z=16`

* Apparently screen sharing to live video on iOS [is experiencing frame rate issues](https://t.me/TelegramiOStalk/104997).

## Gripes
- [ ] Telegram’s lack of keyboard support on iOS…
- [ ] (Most of my complaints are adjacent to that.) Automatically placing the cursor in the text field (at least when I’ve got a keyboard connected) would certainly help out *my* use tremendously.
