# Notes-Telegram

## General
* **Telegram and Discord are the same age**
* Telegram’s cross-platform, resource-frugal clients and phone number-based accounts/auth literally make it more **class mobile** than Discord.
* What in fuck is this website… “[Telegram for iOS - NONE](http://tsfkb.wikidot.com/apps:ios)”
* My [personal Telegram satellite GitHub Repository](https://github.com/extratone/t)
* [Send to Telegram Drafts Action](https://actions.getdrafts.com/a/18E)
* [r/columbiamo - Local Telegram Group Chat for Columbia](https://reddit.com/r/columbiamo/comments/c4na0v/local_telegram_group_chat_for_columbia/)
* Relative link to messages that don't involve complex scripting.
* Unlimited file upload limit - **2GB PER FILE LIMIT**.
* Cross-platform as all fuck.
* Every programming/scripting language ever has at least a few (probably unfinished and abandoned) projects in the wild building support for Telegram APIs.
* Drafts as a safe dependable space to compose text does not have a windows equivalent, but Telegram can sort of function in that regard, largely because it continuously saves what one types in the text field. 
* Element … or Matrix… or whatever the actual protocol is called… is nothing but a great way to waste your time and the planet’s energy in obfuscating willy nilly. 
* Perhaps I should have accepted long ago that my particular priorities are *not* as resonant with other users as I would like to believe.
* Notification management in Telegram as well considered as I’ve ever experienced, which makes a lot of sense now that I am a long time user.
* When I lost all my shit in Portland, much of what was saved was thanks to Telegram.
* The particular features that define Telegram’s competence are not immediately obvious, for the most part. Being able to quickly change the recipient of a forwarded message, for instance,
* Telegram is notably lacking in translation support considering it's such an international space.
* Microsoft Teams needs to be considered as an alternative since it's being so heavily emphasized for *personal use* in Windows 11.
