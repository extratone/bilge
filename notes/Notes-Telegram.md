# Notes-Telegram

* Relative link to messages that don't involve complex scripting.
* Unlimited file upload limit - **2GB PER FILE LIMIT**.
* Cross-platform as all fuck.
* Every programming/scripting language ever has at least a few (probably unfinished and abandoned) projects in the wild building support for Telegram APIs.
* Drafts as a safe dependable space to compose text does not have a windows equivalent, but Telegram can sort of function in that regard, largely because it continuously saves what one types in the text field.

This is going to seem entirely out of left field, but for those looking for that OG function of Drafts... as just a safe place to compose text you intend to use elsewhere (as opposed to the Tweet compose interface, which just lost me like 15 minutes of typing, which led me here... hehe,)

I have been using [**Telegram**](https://desktop.telegram.org/), of all things for years. notably, if you hit Ctrl + 0 from *anywhere* in the Windows client, you and your cursor are taken to the compose field beneath your personal "Saved Messages" channel, which is searchable, has an extremely high per-message character limit (after which it just automatically splits,) and is ridiculously reliable in saving "drafts" live as you're typing. as in... I have actively tried to lose characters by killing the application and then logging in on my phone and have yet to accomplish losing a single one (among other advantages: zero formatting added to plain text by default - not even line breaks - no total file limit and *2GB* per file limit uploads, absurdly cross-platform, literally more reliable than SMS in poor network conditions.) you can immediately reenter a sent message with `â†‘` to edit, copy it, escape with just `Esc` and then paste to start a new revision.

my other suggestion which I would personally use for this if I wasn't such a high-intensity clipboard user:
God's great gift to man, [**CopyQ**](https://hluk.github.io/CopyQ/,) is an extremely robust and infinitely customizable clipboard manager that supports complex scripting and.... somehow... I just managed to set up live syncing of my CopyQ clipboard over *iCloud for Windows*, and you absolutely would not believe how well it actually works.
