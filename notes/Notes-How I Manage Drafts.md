> Drafts made it too easy to dump my thoughts into text.

> I have too many drafts to handle. I tried to Merge them, file them into Obsidian, act on them but I have since given up. Sometimes, I tell myself that it might just be easier to tag them in Drafts and keep them into Workspaces i.e. using Drafts as my filing system instead. The Search is pretty good anyway.

> I know I should make it a habit to review my drafts at the end of the day to move them to it’s appropriate system. Often, I find myself too exhausted at the end of the day that I just want to close the computer and call it a day. Then, they start to pile up. 

> What is the best practice?

One of the absolute core differences between Drafts and native filesystem-based applications like Obsidian is the fundamental way notes are organized. I’ll quote this particularly succinct passage [from the documentation](https://docs.getdrafts.com/drafts/):

> Drafts has a lightweight organization system similar to email. Individual drafts are created in the “Inbox”. When a draft has been processed, it can be moved to the Archive to long term storage or the Trash if it no longer needed. A draft can also, optionally, be flagged and have any number of tags assigned to it.

Chronology is the primary sortation method by default - by creation date, last modified date, or last accessed date. Drafts and Bear share the basic principle, as you’ll note in the screenshot embedded below - the two writing applications which have had the greatest influence on my thinking. It’s important to mention this, I think, because there’s a very real possibility I have been too embedded in the core methodology of these systems for too long to be critical of them and am blinded to the full spectrum of advantages inherent to directly editing text files in the filesystem.
