# Notes-YouTube Music

## Twitter Collection

**Description**

> Around 5 years ago, I spent significant time exploring YouTube’s newly released streaming service… I figured I might as well try again.

In theory, YouTube Music should have been the perfect streaming platform at just about the perfect time to ascend above the others. Chances are, if someone wanted to share a *track* with you in that era (2016,) there was a super high chance of it being in the form of a regular `youtu.be`  url. Not that it was a new practice, by any means. In fact, it was as well established among young people as any digital means of sharing I’ve ever seen. Depending on one’s access/relationship to digital music ownership, otherwise, I would surmise that a great many of my neighboring peers  on the timeline could reasonably describe YouTube as their first music streaming service.
