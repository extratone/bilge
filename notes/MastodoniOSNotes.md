### Thread

- Toot is just a joy to use. It has a little too much sometimes (it actually contains little mini games...which really aren't needed), but the experience of using it has some really clever UI twists. ⏤ by *mikepictor* (↑ 6/ ↓ 0)
	- Toot’s great, too. That’s what I was using before trying Metatext, and I have absolutely nothing bad to say about it except that it doesn’t feel as “native” as Metatext.

Others I’ve tried:

-	Amaroq: Hasn’t been meaningfully updated in ages.
-	Mast: _So_ much promise, but the author is also writing the popular new Aviary app fo Twitter and seems to be concentrating on that.
-	Mercury for Mastodon: I love it, but iPhone only. It operates in “zoomed in to fill the screen” mode on iPad and that ruins it for me.

Honorable mention:

-	Linky: Not for _reading_ Mastodon, but brilliant for _posting_ to it. It’s my go-to for sharing web pages I stumble across, and I’ve scripted Drafts.app to automate Linky so that I can write a toot in Drafts and easily share it. ⏤ by *GummyKibble* (↑ 2/ ↓ 0)
		- Toot! and Metatext are definitely my two favorite. ⏤ by *moonizsenpai* (↑ 3/ ↓ 0)

Thank you so much for your thoughts, for one.

For two, I am a Drafts user and would be very interested in that Action if you've shared it publicly. If not, no worries at all. ⏤ by *AsphaltApostle* (↑ 2/ ↓ 0)
			- It’s an action with a single step:

    linky://x-callback-url/compose?text=[[draft]]

(I have another action to post from my Mac but it’s a lot more complex.) ⏤ by *GummyKibble* (↑ 2/ ↓ 0)
- I’m loving Metatext right now. It looks like a native app on both iOS and iPadOS. ⏤ by *GummyKibble* (↑ 6/ ↓ 0)
	- That’s very good to know, thank you! I don’t have an iPad (or easy access to one,) so I particularly appreciate that insight. ⏤ by *AsphaltApostle* (↑ 1/ ↓ 0)
- I’m using Amaroq, which works well but is missing support for polls. ⏤ by *cheesy_the_clown* (↑ 3/ ↓ 0)
- I've been pretty happy with amaroq ⏤ by *Agitated_Rent_2089* (↑ 2/ ↓ 0)
