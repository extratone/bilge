# iPhone 12 Pro Max Notes

- [ ] Full hardware specs ([Apple](https://www.apple.com/iphone-12-pro/specs/)) (Pro Max Weight: 228 g (8.0 oz))

- [ ] It was completely irrational for me to get a new phone at this point in my life, considering I never leave the house.
- [ ] "[Wireless Charging Is a Disaster Waiting to Happen](https://debugger.medium.com/wireless-charging-is-a-disaster-waiting-to-happen-48afdde70ed9)" | *Debugger*
- [ ] Face ID... oh boy.
- [ ] "Pacific Blue" - as in, the same color as featured in the [iPhone 12 Pro Trailer](https://youtu.be/cnXapYkboRQ)(?)
- [ ] The [battery percentage issue](https://www.imore.com/how-get-battery-percentage-your-iphone-x).
- [ ] I wish part of starting over included re-downloading all my shortcuts, tbh. ([Shortcuts Repo](https://github.com/extratone/shortcuts))
- [ ] I played my first *Call of Duty* match in something like 10 years and got MVP. I don't know if this means anything or not. [*Call of Duty: Mobile*](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/call-of-duty-mobile/id1287282214) (The title alone... lmao.)
- [ ] As always with new phone reviews, I am presented with a dilemma: the device, itself is by far the best camera I own. (Technically, my only other imaging device is my [Nikon COOLPIX 990](https://www.flickr.com/gp/davidblue/V861Vx), which has long since eaten up every last AA battery I had.) I must use the device, itself to take any images of the device.

- [ ] I finally own the *mid*-capacity option instead of the lowest-capacity option!
- [ ] The Screen Recording badge is finally subtle! 
- [ ] I see how "threaded replies" work in iMessage now.
- [ ] I am still sufficiently hung up on the idea of attaching "Pro" (as in "*professional grade*") to the name of a handset, but it at least makes *far* more sense than "PlayStation Pro."
- [ ] Probably revisit Type to Siri - I just discovered that you can enable "Hey, Siri" support all the time and *leave Type to Siri on*!
- [ ] It fits in my (male) pockets without fuss.

## Apple, Inc.

- [ ] I'm not so sure the "Walled Garden" term really applies when I can now connect my phone to a shared folder on my PC over my local network with zero trouble. And *then*... there's all that one can do with Shortcuts. (Or at least... That they could do in the very beginning.)
- [ ] The framerate complaints just seem absurd to me (the insistence that 60Hz is just too low of a refresh rate for even a handset display, these days.) On YouTube, JSL Review's *one week later* video reminded me about the potential increase in power consumption say... doubling the screen's refresh rate to 120

# Software (Apps)

### An age old question: how long do you cling on to native iOS apps (Mail, Podcasts, Weather, etc.) after other offerings have surpassed them simply because they integrate better(?)
