## Social

this the closest I've ever come to a homescreen in this device's layout which I'm at least *comfortable seeing every now and then*. idk why I"m so bad or why I even waste my time - the rational thing would be to just duplicate whatever homescreens I can find of Federico Viticci's lol.

## Initial Task List

- [ ] Update Hell
- [ ] Authentication Hell
- [ ] Is Tot gonna work? If not, replace with widgets?
- [ ] Swift Playgrounds

### Bad Ideas List

- Assess how difficult it would actually be to build a simple application in Swift Playgrounds to act as the keyboard shortcuts guide for iPhone. See: [KeyboardKit](https://github.com/KeyboardKit/KeyboardKit) - [Tweet](https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/1534133062715547648)

## Hardware Notes

- Default, in-box charger struggling to keep up regardless of whether or not it's plugged directly into the device or into the Magic Keyboard Fucker Stand
- Turns out, the Magic Keyboard Fucker Stand does not seem to mean I would no longer need my iPhone Suspension Hell Tripod Contraption, but rather that I need a MUCH more stout one.
- Inevitably, one of the biggest components of the iPad Pro's overwhelming power in *my* life (probably *the* biggest, realistically,) is what it reveals of the operating system that is truly broken and what obstacles are literally just a resource issue that need only require brute Booty.
- THE BLACKS. (In the display.) You know me to be a superficial user but my god!

## General Software Notes

- The background persistence really is uncanny... like stumbling upon the fact that I was still logged in to TildeTown IRC in Blink (mosh tho) after like TWO DAYS without opening  Blink even though I had *not* enabled `geo track`.

## General Keyboarding Notes

- I must confesss, I was *completely unaware* of the existence of iPadOS' "Floating Keyboard" view and when I inexplicably managed to trigger it for the fist time, I was treated to a pretty severe laughing fit because... well.

## Questions Answered

- [ ] *Does iPad/iPadOS respond to multiple connected keyboards at once?* - Yes! Thank God.
