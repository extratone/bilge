## General

- Class Traitor
- Toilet Computer??
- I could have sworn the duration of holding `⌘` to prompt the keyboard shortcuts guide used to be configurable on iPadOS... perhaps it was just a dream...
- some handy BS I inevitably noodled into being: you could argue that this is as close as computers will ever get to Divine Form, given that the only physical media God ever delivered to man was in tablet format. - [Tweet](https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/1538013665806340096)
- The incentivized use of Quick Notes should be... further incentivized by changes coming in iOS/iPadOS 16.
- The globe key.
- How I changed the cursor color/size?

this the closest I've ever come to a homescreen in this device's layout which I'm at least *comfortable seeing every now and then*. idk why I"m so bad or why I even waste my time - the rational thing would be to just duplicate whatever homescreens I can find of Federico Viticci's lol.

## Initial Task List

- [ ] Update Hell
- [ ] Authentication Hell
- [x] Is Tot gonna work? If not, replace with widgets? ANSWER: TOT WORKS - See [Twitter Video](https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/1538105518882963459)
- [ ] Swift Playgrounds

### Bad Ideas List

- Assess how difficult it would actually be to build a simple application in Swift Playgrounds to act as the keyboard shortcuts guide for iPhone. See: [KeyboardKit](https://github.com/KeyboardKit/KeyboardKit) - [Tweet](https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/1534133062715547648)

## Hardware Notes

- Default, in-box charger struggling to keep up regardless of whether or not it's plugged directly into the device or into the Magic Keyboard Fucker Stand
- Turns out, the Magic Keyboard Fucker Stand does not seem to mean I would no longer need my iPhone Suspension Hell Tripod Contraption, but rather that I need a MUCH more stout one.
- Inevitably, one of the biggest components of the iPad Pro's overwhelming power in *my* life (probably *the* biggest, realistically,) is what it reveals of the operating system that is truly broken and what obstacles are literally just a resource issue that need only require brute Booty.
- THE BLACKS. (In the display.) You know me to be a superficial user but my god!
- I can almost see how one needn't miss the function keys, but *I* continuously encountered situations (which I'd before configured myself into with set keyboard shortcuts on iPhone) where I did not know how to proceed without keys missing from my Full Beauty Board. I love page up and down! Home and end! I don't want to fucking *read* a webpage, I just want to see the top or the bottom!

## General Software Notes

- The background persistence really is uncanny... like stumbling upon the fact that I was still logged in to TildeTown IRC in Blink (mosh tho) after like TWO DAYS without opening  Blink even though I had *not* enabled `geo track`.
- Put simply, this device (versus any iPhone) makes Safari's native Reading List/Bookmarks functionalities *actually worthwile to use*.
- There are glimpses of desktop-like window management throughout iPadOS (yet another one is coming with Stage Manager in iPadOS 16,) but frankly - as someone who has used this operating system very extensively under the assumption I would never have to deal with windowing - they have all come across as awkward and problematic. The funniest one - I was wondering why multiple windows kept showing up for Mail - just like its macOS counterpart, Mail's behavior when it comes to open new drafts is baffling and problematic.
- On that windowing note, I frankly like Drafts' tried and true solutions addressing the single-window-only limitations of before (callable sidebars, fixed toolbars) *far* more than how it behaves in Split View. Again, I'm sure I could configure my way out of this, but fuck.

## General Keyboarding Notes

- I must confesss, I was *completely unaware* of the existence of iPadOS' "Floating Keyboard" view and when I inexplicably managed to trigger it for the fist time, I was treated to a pretty severe laughing fit because... well.

## Questions Answered

- [ ] *Does iPad/iPadOS respond to multiple connected keyboards at once?* - Yes! Thank God.
