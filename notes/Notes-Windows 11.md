# Notes: Windows 11

* I will *never* go in [that goddamned garage](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/garage/).
* It is still mostly disappointing that it turned out this is what Microsoft was spending all that time on, but... At least they didn't disappear entirely, as I thought.

## In (basically) the span of a single year...

* Windows finally gained a package manager.
* Running GUI Linux applications in a Windows desktop environment was "finally" realized.
* Microsoft made public [their first fucking Linux Distribution](https://github.com/microsoft/CBL-Mariner). (See linux.microsoft.com if/when it recovers.)
