## An alternative for those who refuse to pay for premium experiences but can no longer use ~~Tweetie~~ Twitter’s native option.

A few minutes ago, Twitter’s native iOS client inexplicably logged me out of the three accounts I’d signed in for the *second time today*, which for the first time prompted not anger, nor even frustration, truly, but a whole-body, calming, peaceful acceptance: **for me and my house, the time really has come to let com.atebits.Tweetie2 finally rest **.

#### Its last functions on my device 
1. Sharing the highest-quality image files possible.
2. Interacting with my account settings (checking up, exploring new beta features, etc.)
3. Hosting, popping-in, and testing Twitter Spaces.
4. Notifications.

For just these, the app occupied a woeful amount of file space compared to… just about anything else (we’re talking [*by a factor of ten*](https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/1432312460095148034)) and at this point, literally too much of *my life* and emotional energy with its unendingly stupefying level of neglect. It hasn’t made sense for a long time.
