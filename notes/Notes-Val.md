ya know, I love James Bond too folks but let's be honest with ourselves... #BondOnPrime doesn't actually constitute any sort of actual *event*. James Bond oversaturates.

BUT, if you're already on Prime Video, anyway, take a chance and watch this, instead. https://www.amazon.com/Val-Kilmer/dp/B09888KKZK

if we ultimately measure films by their emotional substance (vaguely adjacent to what we find ourselves describing as "honesty," I think,) this might well be the best I've ever seen. it certainly packed more "humanity" into the godforsaken format than I can remember ever experiencing in two hours.
