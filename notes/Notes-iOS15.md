## General
* Yes, the degree to which being able to delete an app directly from the results of a Spotlight search is a relief is actually just pitiful.

## Safari
* [Suggestion for Safari iOS 15](https://developer.apple.com/forums/thread/681880) | Apple Developer Forums

[[Hands-on: Here's how the all-new Safari in iOS 15 works]]

  * ==Access Safari Tabs by either tapping the double square icon or simply swiping up on the Tab Bar==
  * You can search Tabs at the top, press/hold + drag Tabs to rearrange them
  * Add a new Tab in the bottom left with the + icon, or tab Tabs in the bottom middle to customize Tab Groups
  * Tap a Tab or choose Done in the bottom right corner to leave the Tab view
  * Another change here is the X to close out Tabs has moved from the top left to the top right
 * To create a custom Tab Group, tap **_X Tabs_** in the bottom middle of the Tabs screen (this is also where Private browsing lives now)
  * Choose New Empty Tab Group or New Tab Group from X Tabs
  * Name your Tab Group, tap OK

### Photos
> Setting different filters will result in different song choices and transition effects to nail a wider variety of vibes on Memories videos. While watching a video generated by Memories, ==you can tap and hold at any time to freeze a photo so that it doesn’t transition away.== The song playing over the video will not pause when you do this, but when you let go the remaining video transitions and timings will be automatically altered to match back up with the song’s beat.
