elaboration:

this is the $349 “Magic Keyboard for iPad Pro” which
* is not actually a full-sized keyboard
* doesn’t feel all that great
* can ONLY be used with an iPad

compared to a $149 “Magic Keyboard:”
* can be used with iPad and EVERYTHING ELSE (with Bluetooth.)

the first version of this product was unveiled alongside the first generation iPad Pro - as if Apple could not consciously sell a “professional”-ish computer without a physical keyboard.

it also symbolizes iPadOS’ split off of iOS - which took all the Bluetooth keyboard support docs with it. 

so… basically, this object represents everything I have been working against this year lol.

HOWEVER… I could not honestly look my mother in the face and tell her I could come up with a more succinct keyboarding solution… especially in the midst of an already big shift (MacOS/MBP-iPad Pro as primary work machine.)
