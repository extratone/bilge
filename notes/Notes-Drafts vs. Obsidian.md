## General
- [ ] Might just be because my systems are limited in performance?
- [ ] The one thing Drafts cannot offer and probably never will: true cross-platform integration with Windows. That's fucking okay, though.
- [ ] It’s not that I’m against Electron apps - as a Windows user, I cannot afford to be discriminating whatsoever when it comes to new, functional software.
- [ ] [Native file integrations](https://docs.getdrafts.com/docs/actions/steps/services) with Twitter, Dropbox, Evernote, WordPress, Medium, Google Drive, Gmail, Google Tasks, Box, OneDrive, OneNote, Outlook, Microsoft To Do, Todoist, and any WebDAV-enabled file server, [as I’ve demonstrated](https://bilge.world/using-drafts-with-neocities).
- [ ] I fundamentally *trust* Drafts more than any other notetaking/word living application I've ever used, and a good deal of that comes from what feels like an extremely direct line to Greg.
- [ ] Let me see you live switch back and forth between devices editing the same documents with any coherence in Obsidian, eh? Git is wonderful, but it was built to be used like we’re using it, and we need to consider that. Indeed, what if iCloud Drive sync is mostly an advantage? *Especially* when it’s Native As Fuck.
