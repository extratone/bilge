## General
- [ ] Might just be because my systems are limited in performance?
- [ ] The one thing Drafts cannot offer and probably never will: true cross-platform integration with Windows. That's fucking okay, though.
- [ ] It’s not that I’m against Electron apps - as a Windows user, I cannot afford to be discriminating whatsoever when it comes to new, functional software.
- [ ] [Native file integrations](https://docs.getdrafts.com/docs/actions/steps/services) with Twitter, Dropbox, Evernote, WordPress, Medium, Google Drive, Gmail, Google Tasks, Box, OneDrive, OneNote, Outlook, Microsoft To Do, Todoist, and any WebDAV-enabled file server, [as I’ve demonstrated](https://bilge.world/using-drafts-with-neocities).
- [ ] I fundamentally *trust* Drafts more than any other notetaking/word living application I've ever used, and a good deal of that comes from what feels like an extremely direct line to Greg.
- [ ] Let me see you live switch back and forth between devices editing the same documents with any coherence in Obsidian, eh? Git is wonderful, but it was built to be used like we’re using it, and we need to consider that. Indeed, what if iCloud Drive sync is mostly an advantage? *Especially* when it’s Native As Fuck.
- [ ] I just a moment ago rid my main repository of Obsidian for good and it was almost 1000 files.
- [ ] Still much much more out of the box because it is so in a different way - I keep discovering things Drafts will do for me instead of something else, but better, where I feel like Obsidian is all about finding more stuff to do.

## Misc
- [ ] [Obsidian Attempt · Issue #219 · extratone/bilge](https://github.com/extratone/bilge/issues/219)
- [ ] Wikilinks are actually really dangerous.
- [ ] Direct integration with Agiltortoise’s [Terminology](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/terminology-dictionary/id687798859) remains unique, compelling, and far superior, ridiculously, to the subscription fee-requiring LookUp.
