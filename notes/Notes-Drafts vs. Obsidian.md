## Obsidian Positives!

- [ ] **Keyboard shortcuts tracking**! Though Obsidian’s iPadOS/iOS app is notably the first I’ve ever seen that somehow escapes the iPad’s system shortcuts guide, there’s a huge personal advantage for me in the fact that somewhere, Obsidian’s current keyboard shortcuts configuration at any given time is exposable in my filesystem, and changes to the configuration are, therefore, git-trackable!

## General

- [ ] Might just be because my systems are limited in performance?
- [ ] The one thing Drafts cannot offer and probably never will: true cross-platform integration with Windows. That's fucking okay, though.
- [ ] It’s not that I’m against Electron apps - as a Windows user, I cannot afford to be discriminating whatsoever when it comes to new, functional software.
- [ ] [Native file integrations](https://docs.getdrafts.com/docs/actions/steps/services) with Twitter, Dropbox, Evernote, WordPress, Medium, Google Drive, Gmail, Google Tasks, Box, OneDrive, OneNote, Outlook, Microsoft To Do, Todoist, and any WebDAV-enabled file server, [as I’ve demonstrated](https://bilge.world/using-drafts-with-neocities).
- [ ] I fundamentally *trust* Drafts more than any other notetaking/word living application I've ever used, and a good deal of that comes from what feels like an extremely direct line to Greg.
- [ ] Let me see you live switch back and forth between devices editing the same documents with any coherence in Obsidian, eh? Git is wonderful, but it was built to be used like we’re using it, and we need to consider that. Indeed, what if iCloud Drive sync is mostly an advantage? *Especially* when it’s Native As Fuck.
- [ ] I just a moment ago rid my main repository of Obsidian for good and it was almost 1000 files.
- [ ] Still much much more out of the box because it is so in a different way - I keep discovering things Drafts will do for me instead of something else, but better, where I feel like Obsidian is all about finding more stuff to do.
- [ ] Using draft_open_links and Tot, I have created my own dashboard outside of Drafts, which works especially beautifully on macOS.
- [ ] Instant synonyms with `^⌥S` calling Stephen Millard’s `TAD-Replace With Synonym` action. (As part of [ThoughtAsylum-Writing Action Group](https://actions.getdrafts.com/g/1cu))
- [ ] In essence, I’m just worried.
- [x] Backwards compatibility! - I was able to sync all ~1600 drafts in my library + themes + actions in around 5 minutes on an eight-year-old iPad Air.
- [ ] Launching webpages from my Test note because of TextExpander integration.
- [ ] How easy it was to [repair the TAD issue](https://forums.getdrafts.com/t/script-error-syntaxerror-json-parse-error-unexpected-identifier-drafts-line-number-53-column-35/12187).
- [ ] Posting to WordPress/Medium with a single step.
- [ ] [Taio](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/taio-markdown-text-actions/id1527036273) is perhaps even more redundant in regards to Drafts, but establishing its own identity.
- [ ] [Actions for Obsidian in the Action Directory](https://actions.getdrafts.com/search?utf8=✓&q=obsidian).
- [ ] Drafts’ absurdly high rating in the App Store.
- [ ] [Live preview update - Obsidian Help](https://help.obsidian.md/Live+preview+update)
- [ ] [Folding Text / Collapsable Headers - Feature Requests - Drafts Community](https://forums.getdrafts.com/t/folding-text-collapsable-headers/1034) - it looks like I may be one of few Drafts users who is *uninterested* in folding headers. In the several implementations I’ve tried them over the years, they tend to just confuse me / get me lost.
- [ ] My *entire* library of just over 2000 drafts can be exported in seconds into a single, 26.3 megabyte [JSON file](https://i.snap.as/NJQL39r9.png).

## Misc

- [ ] [Obsidian Attempt · Issue #219 · extratone/bilge](https://github.com/extratone/bilge/issues/219)
- [ ] Wikilinks are actually really dangerous.
- [ ] Direct integration with Agiltortoise’s [Terminology](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/terminology-dictionary/id687798859) remains unique, compelling, and far superior, ridiculously, to the subscription fee-requiring LookUp.

> This is not a setup I use, so others may have more specific comments, but for a lot of Drafts users they prefer to keep Drafts as their temporary storage where they gather fleeting thoughts, ideas, tasks, etc., throughout the day - and have another more curated long-term storage system for notes.
> In the paper world analogy, Drafts is the inbox on their desk - Obsidian (or other system) their filing cabinet.  Some things that hit your inbox end up going back out to someone else’s desk, some to the shredder - and only some to the permanent, organized reference source of the filing cabinet.
> People have used Drafts like this for years with different back end storage systems - from Evernote, to files in Dropbox. Obsidian seems to be a new popular choice for this type of reference because of it’s enhanced abilities to cross-reference documents.
> (Obsidian people feel free to expand on that or clarify if I am wrong)

> In Obsidian, the file in photos is copied into the Obsidian vault when you select it. Hence it can use a relative reference to the file at that point.
> Drafts could easily insert the text content for the image reference, and send that over to Obsidian. The tricky bit however is referencing an image held in the photos app.
> As a text-based tool, Drafts does have the capability to do some work with files, but primarily text files, and nothing for interacting with files held within the Apple Photos application - they are not available through the files app.
> In a similar Shortcuts-based approach to the one used by @tf2, you could replicate the Obsidian process (not using external hosting), and you can integrate that with an action in Drafts that adds the image reference. But Drafts alone is not currently able to interact directly with Apple Photos.
