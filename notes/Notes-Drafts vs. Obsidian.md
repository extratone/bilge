## General
- [ ] Might just be because my systems are limited in performance?
- [ ] The one thing Drafts cannot offer and probably never will: true cross-platform integration with Windows. That's fucking okay, though.
- [ ] It’s not that I’m against Electron apps - as a Windows user, I cannot afford to be discriminating whatsoever when it comes to new, functional software.
