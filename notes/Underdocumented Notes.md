# NOTES: Underdocumented Maneuvers in iOS
It became most apparent during my research for my iPhone 12 Pro Max Review that Apple’s mobile operating system and all that it entails has changed profoundly over the course of its history even moreso than is immediately obvious. The operating system that thwarted the very idea of the Power User currently has numerous features that were added explicitly for them. (One might suggest this really began in iOS 12, with [Siri Shortcuts](http://bilge.world/siri-shortcuts-ios12-review).) The trouble is that many of these features overlap into what the most average user might use in their day-to-day operation of their handsets and tablets. Showing timestamps in iMessage, for instance, is a function which one should not have to stumble upon or take to an internet search to find. (Swipe from right to left in a conversation.) Little functions like this are incredibly poorly documented, considering iOS is maintained by the most valuable company in the history of the world.
Apple does make an effort to educate new users, mainly through the [Tips app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/tips/id1069509450), which has indeed become more useful and insightful over time. They also publish an owner’s manual-esque *[iPhone Users Guide](https://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewBook?id=1515995528)*, which is unfortunately completely inaccessible in any format outside of the native Books app. (I made a not-insignificant effort to convert the volume to a PDF for your sake, but found myself completely defeated by DRM, hilariously.) 

Since the very moment the iPhone was first unveiled to the world, we have have been told over and over again how wonderfully intuitive and easy to use its operating system is/was. Ease of use was leaned heavily upon by Apple in iPhone OS' adolescence as justification for its omission of certain features (both actively and by chance) which its direct, Android-running rivals would then often make their next flagship int
