> keyboard shortcuts

> it’s the most powerful and customizable Twitter client you can find on Apple platforms right now.

> in the upcoming version 4.0 of Spring, you’ll be able to open any view as a custom, in-app split-screen mode that works in tandem with multi-windowing on iPad but is also supported on the iPhone.

> You can select text on images with Live Text.

> Spring is the only third-party Twitter client I’ve found that tries to “complete” threads in the main timeline just like the Twitter official app and website do, meaning that you’ll always see the original tweet alongside a reply to it in your timeline for additional context.

> Spring has added support for viewing edited tweets and their edited history as well as tweets containing mixed media.

> anything can become a custom view in the app and turned into a permanent tab for future access.
