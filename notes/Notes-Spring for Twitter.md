**re: Spring**

Federico, I don't suppose you've had better luck than I so far looking for custom Spring themes to import, have you?

I had a go at making one after my blog's appearance (which folks seem to like far more than I do at this point lol) https://davidblue.wtf/springtheme

also looks like the devs haven't compiled a collection or anything: https://twitter.com/theSpringApp/status/1586188545357512704


## General

- I love that Spring actually acknowledges Twitter User IDs!
- The "Open in Spring" Safari extension even works for searches!
- Need "Retweet from account" function
- One component of the new Twitter API Spring seems *utterly* uninterested in supporting: **Twitter Fucking Spaces** https://twitter.com/i/spaces/1mnGeRDElyZJX?s=20

### Keyboard

- A keyboard shortcut for account switching.
- The "Shortcuts" toggle fucks with SPRING's compose window *too*. Kill me.
- In Spring, not only can you navigate a given Twitter timeline with the `⇧⇩⇦⇨` keys, you can also use `WASD` just like in a video game! https://www.icloud.com/numbers/0b4TKE1f-NCZ92R5X2GlXIUJw#SpringforTwitterKeyboardShortcuts

> keyboard shortcuts

> it’s the most powerful and customizable Twitter client you can find on Apple platforms right now.

> in the upcoming version 4.0 of Spring, you’ll be able to open any view as a custom, in-app split-screen mode that works in tandem with multi-windowing on iPad but is also supported on the iPhone.

> You can select text on images with Live Text.

> Spring is the only third-party Twitter client I’ve found that tries to “complete” threads in the main timeline just like the Twitter official app and website do, meaning that you’ll always see the original tweet alongside a reply to it in your timeline for additional context.

> Spring has added support for viewing edited tweets and their edited history as well as tweets containing mixed media.

> anything can become a custom view in the app and turned into a permanent tab for future access.
