Essayist allows you to write APA, MLA, Chicago & Harvard Style essays with ease. From in-text citations and footnotes to references and page setup, Essayist takes care of everything. It greatly simplifies the academic writing process.

AUTOMATIC FORMATTING
Essayist formats everything for you. Upon starting a new essay it sets up the title section/page, margins, font, line spacing, alignment, page headers/footers, etc. It formats your references, in-text citations, footnotes/endnotes, figures, tables, table of contents and more.

REFERENCES
Add references quickly and easily using Google Scholar, Essayist’s built-in search, by pasting a URL or manual entry forms. Once added, references are automatically formatted and added to your essay’s references/works cited list.

IN-TEXT CITATIONS
Essayist automatically detects when you are about to insert an in-text citation and presents a list of all your references. Simply tap the reference you wish to cite and continue writing.

FOOTNOTES/ENDNOTES
Essayist makes it really easy to add footnotes. Simply, tap the insert citation button, select the reference you wish to cite and that's it. A footnote is automatically created for you. If you prefer to use endnotes, you can switch your citation method to endnotes in Settings.

CITATION STYLES
Essayist supports four citation styles: APA, MLA, Chicago/Turabian & Harvard.
*Supported Versions: APA 7th Edition, MLA 8th & 9th Edition, Turabian 9th Edition, Harvard Snooks Style Manual and Cite Them Right 11th Edition, among various other versions from institutions throughout the UK and Australia*
