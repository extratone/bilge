# Keys Origin Story Artifact

It's 19-year-old David Blue, face nearly parallel to the black surface and 4 or 5 inches above an iPhone 4S, which sits squarely atop a textbook, untouched, his arms stretched over the book, the phone, and nearly half the table, hands gyrating on a white, keypad-less Magic Keyboard near its center. It's immediately obvious that his glasses are about to slip all the way off, so extreme is the angle of his activity, but just before they do, he drives out a conclusory burst, one-two's a cross-keyboard shortcut, and then jerks suddenly up, grabbing the phone with both hands, arcing all the wav back into the tastelessly-finished, faux-cherry hardback chair to rest in a thoroughly-juvenile slouch, device and two hands resting on his stomach. His eyes take a moment to adequately refocus the new distance and comprehend the result of his mysterious, tiny screen-bound pounding, then, beforing hissing (laughter) a snort to himself. Tragically, he then whips his _thumbs_ up into _even more violent_ and sporadic tapping on the screen, itself, now, still in blunt bursts and darn near as disruptive as the other thing, somehow.
