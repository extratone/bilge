# Keys Collaboration Listing

[Listing on Dev.To](https://dev.to/listings/collabs/writing-the-definitive-guide-for-using-an-iphone-with-a-bluetooth-keyboard-36oa)

The iPhone has supported Bluetooth keyboard input for virtually its entire history, yet proper, detailed documentation of shortcuts (native or per-app,) and other specifics has never existed. 

I have decided to create a thorough, well-presented reference guide to address this gap for End Users, app developers, and any others who may find it useful.
