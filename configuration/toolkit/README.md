# Theme Toolkit

This toolkit contains a simple theme template, a sample `.md` file for testing, and some HTML files for designers/developers to preview/debug css themes right inside their browser.

## How to use

Copy and rename your `.css` theme file as `html-preview/theme/test.css` and copy related resources, like images, fonts or imported css used by your css file into correspond folder. Then open `.html` files under folder `html-preview/html` by your browser to preview/debug your css theme.

## HTML files

| File                               | Use |
| :--------------------------------- | :-- |
| `lorem.html`                       | Preview the basic typesetting.
| `outline-open-and-focus-mode.html` | Preview pinned outline panel on Typora for macOS, and focus mode.
| `source-mode.html`                 | Preview source code mode syntax highlighting style.
| `ui-controls.html`                 | Preview some control UIs on macOS, Windows, and Linux and window frame for "unibody"  style on Windows.
| `ui-controls2.html`                | Preview tips/notifications in Typora and the side panel style on Windows/Linux.
| `unibody.html`                     | Preview the menu style for "unibody"  style on Windows.

So you may find components you never seen in Typora because they may only be available for specific OS platform. If you want to submit your Typora theme to [Typora Theme Gallery](http://theme.typora.io), and share with other users, we strongly recommend you to go through all those HTML files to make your theme looks great on all platform.

## Notice

- This toolkit is created for Typora >= 0.9.9.7.8 (macOS) or Typora >= 0.9.19 (Windows/Linux). Update your Typora to latest version, and update this toolkit to latest version by `git pull` or other commands.
- **Do not edit/format HTML files**, even though they are ugly and unreadable, currently the final rendered output is whitespace sensitive.
- Better to use Chrome or Safari. (in macOS, typora uses Safari as web engine, in Windows/Linux typora uses Chrome, but their rendering results are almost the same).
- If you meet error like `[Not allowed to load local resource: file://XXXX]` in browser's console, the quickest solution for me is to use tools like [httpster](https://github.com/SimbCo/httpster) or [CodeKit](https://incident57.com/codekit/) to host the web content into localhost.
