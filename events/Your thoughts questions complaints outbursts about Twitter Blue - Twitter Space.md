Hey folks… At 6PM CST (in 2.5 hours,) I hope you’ll come in and talk specifics about #TwitterBlue with me. I just finished like 3 weeks writing what is still the only feature-by-feature review of it as a product I’ve found. ‪@TwitterBlue‬ ‪@TwitterVideo‬ https://twitter.com/i/spaces/1vAxRkenDlNKl

At 6PM CST (in 2 hours,) I hope you’ll come in and talk specifics about Twitter’s new paid subscription offering with me. I just finished like 3 weeks writing [the only feature-by-feature review of it as a product](https://davidblue.wtf/twitter-blue), as far as I can tell. https://discord.gg/HBYNNmkA?event=918262052034850816
