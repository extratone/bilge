## For the rest of the afternoon/into the evening, I'm going to be live [on Twitch](https://twitch.tv/dieselgoth)!

Guess what?? All I've done in the *hour and a half* since my original stated start time is try and fail to simulcast my Windows desktop along with my iPhone.

So! I'm going to be playing [my interview](https://bilge.world/eugen-rochko-interview) with Mastodon project head Eugen Rochko from his big day back in 2016, followed by an episode of [*Software Engineering Daily*](https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/2018/04/12/mastodon-federated-social-network-with-eugen-rochko/).
