Hello Extratone

I’m Wabi, resident music editor and host of the Web Crates podcast, and I’m here to update all of you on a few things. First would be we now have a patreon, if your unaware of what that is, it’s a monthly subscription service in which you can donate to help with our content. The main reason for starting the patreon plays into the other thing I wanted to talk about. Extratone is planning on going to MAGFest, at least some of us are. Depending on the amount of money patreon raises plays into who all goes, as of now I believe I’m the only who is definitely going but quite a few are trying to. From MAGFest we will be able to bring you video and podcast all in person, which is a Extratone first. We hope to get as many people as possible down there and hopefully see some of you!
