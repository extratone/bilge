`legacy`

I spent last weekend with my family at the Lake of the Ozarks - Missouri's premiere resort area. To get to where we're staying, we have to first cross Bagnell Dam, past Lake Ozark Helicopters, Inc, where one can charter a Robinson R44 - a rickity, gasoline-powered craft that one can only hesitantly call a "helicopter" - to carry up to 500 pounds of flesh for "the most exciting 6 miles you will ever travel" for just $29! 

The town of Lake Ozark is - as far as I can tell - is just a sweeping 2 mile-long hill; a strip of bars? tattoo shops? I don't know. Mostly businesses with some sort of neon lettering and/or outdoor stools.

Supremely more notable on this trip, though, are the motorcycles. In the center buffer of U.S. Route 54, they are parked, virtually handlebar-to-handlebar, and stretching on and on. We are surrounded by a mass of round, mostly strawberry-colored fourty somethings and their bandanas, cobalt sunglasses lenses, and some highly-diluted form of fringed buckskins. 

Nobody had mentioned anything about this event - blanketing the singular entry point to the area, and we're crawling through Harley Davidson Woodstock. At some point, all but the sheer _vastness_ of the motorcycles becomes inconsequential. We continue past the businesses and nearly reach Horseshoe Bend Parkway before the snake of parked "hogs" - I can use that term now because I bothered to do this story - finally ceases.

It _doesn't_ cease, really, though, for the rest of the weekend, as there is never actually a time when the area is quiet. 

We don't make it back out to the strip until nearly 2 in the morning, but I bring my Zoom, and capture a conversation with a somewhat-inebriated attendee whom I shall call Leonard because I cannot imagine his real name's anything close.
