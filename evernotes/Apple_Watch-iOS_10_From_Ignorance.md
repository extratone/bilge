# Apple Watch. iOS 10 From Ignorance

`legacy`

**Apple Watch**

* Well, unpairing/pairing process is Dang Cool
* wish there was a shorter way to access a more unified set audio playback controls, wish they were more responsive.Â 
* it's a shame to look at when there's such a gorgeous display so close by
* volume control with the wheel though... GREAT
* so far, (could be my lack of foreknowledge and experience + opposite position with iPhone/iOS,) its use has actually inhibited my functionality

**iOS 10**

* SO fast, this is a whole new device
* "Search Along Your Route" - one of those things that yeah... should've happened sooner. but at least it's happening now.
