# Untitled Note

`legacy`

There's a lot to do. Colors, more than black. More images than that I see - the windows of a seven thirty seven over a sleeping Houston. Incidentally, I must spend this quantity of my intellect searching its own crevices. I remember traveling with my mom and stepdad before it all - the Colorado sound after Texas. I've always wondered how his internal dialog spoke.

Trying to find the write story. Not the write one to be read - the most worthy.

I cannot for the life of me figure out what it is the others around me are trying to do. Some have suggested that I cease, but then in another face, berate me for being me. They do not understand abrasion.
