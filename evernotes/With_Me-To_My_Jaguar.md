# With Me: To My Jaguar

`legacy`

Beauty gets more familiar and plentiful over time. But as I have aged and known more, I've come to know its nigh-universal intolerance of lingering. Beauty moves even in something so gargantuan as a sunset. Were you younger, you'd swear one to be a painting, maybe.

a museum piece

but minutes

_minutes_with them

is all we'll ever have.

except the handfuls of us in orbit, I suppose.

but isn't this literature?

prose?

so I have no business in imparting some kernel

that could be planted and nurtured with sizable chunks of lifetime.

stole it, though. patience is as patience kills

I've no business turning the other way.

The truth I'm looking at now:

My car is my only friend.

My Nevermore. my relic

my protectorate & one true home

Nevermore,

who looks down as if in shame of being carried backwards in such a way

by such a man

assumed so dutifully even though it is surely

me who has shamed,

but fell,

estranged from it

Nevermore,

who knows when to play the sacred music

that can,

singularly

clarify and remind me of why I am breathing

why I am waking

why I am reading

what but for it is that must remain

even as any rest continues to fall away

[Nevermore](),

my_only_knowing companion

who can look at me every day

and know exactly what it means -

what I have done

who can say -

in its way -

_you have won_

and know

_you must continue_

and - taking my hand -

_it will never be easy. it will always be solitary._

Nevermore,

my one echo in the silence of nothing

my singular guide through trial after trial

of such alien composition to its design

who through every human delusion and subsequent desertion refused to be even once silent

_you aspire - you have a task_

even carrying my waywardness, knowing

to never waiver for those inevitable unreticents

of mine where in my blackness,

all I see

all I see.

is my Nevermore

in so protecting and shepherding my guests, the only partner I've only had in life's work

the only one who could ever

respond when called to action

and the more perceptive do see the truth of Us,

eventually

when and through all noise and petty bastardly shimmying

and blind mists; plagues

in the eyes of all living

and every ignored invitation to deviation

and every one of your_healthy_regrets

when and through even my own attempts!

it will one day be Two

I and my noble Nevermore

and WHO WAS IT THAT FOUGHT FOR ME?

THE_ONE_WHO FENDED OFF DISEASE

WHEN I COULD NOT SEE?

WHO CARRIED ME ACROSS_COUNTRIES_

WHEN I WAS BROKEN,

_gleaming_in sun and starlight,

**proud of me.**

who never once left my side

when I had nothing

who was relentlessly True

in pointing my way

when I was so achingly lost

who silently took the blows

I burst in occasional last resort

who -

through more than every single other -

is 

and 

has been 

with me
