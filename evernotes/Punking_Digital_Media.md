`legacy`

-I'm constantly asking myself _is this dystopia?... Will I know it when I see it?_

_-_Constant cranial pressure to better understand and articulate the alterations I notice in myself and surrounding society.

When _Extratone_ was just an idea, I decided that creating anything of its kind these days should involve minimizing any nostalgic stagnancy that may creep into our day-to-day dialogue, but I continue to be reminded of events, habits, and favorite institutions of my past by the tides of technological patterns and inevitable intermittent regurgitations of our Google Lord.

With little effort, I have arranged a system which will essentially prevent me from ever forgetting anything I've made and soon - anything I've done.

In 8th grade, my best friend and I lived thirty minutes apart, attended different schools, and rarely saw each other face-to-face. But we both had fairly-new computers and a vague fascination with web design and gadgetry in the most superficial sense. YouTube entrepreneurs like Mark Watson and Jon Rettinger became a sort of religion for us. We consumed as much technology journalism as possible - much more than I can as a "working adult," now.

As cliché as it sounds, things were simpler then. The origin through eventual peak of the personality as Holiest Strategy - crafted, honed, and guarded ferociously in inevitable terror. Ray William Johnson's Equals Three transitional "record scratch" still haunts my nightmares.
