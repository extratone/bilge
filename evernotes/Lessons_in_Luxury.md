`legacy`

-“they want things they've never seen”

The marque I'd known for most of my life as “Cadillac” blended with the rest of the American auto industry - a culture that smelled overwhelmingly of_after_and ever-shorter leaps to grasp ideals that seemed so opaque amid the rotten brainflesh of that last bitter Detroit generation. Their prolonged refusal to die created an omnipresent state of ruin; an afterworld littered with endless rattling plastic parts bin trimpieces, sun-faded hood ornaments, and tired, oil-burning powerplants. Cars have always been the cultural expressions which I've understood most clearly, so coming of age at the turn of the century in the bleakness of the Midwest - where aspiration had all but abandoned - led me to believe that America was certainly in its last days, if not already just a twitching corpse.

Everything was exhausted - the oil, the vigor, and the hope for anything better, ever. Meanwhile at home and in school, I was constantly reading about the_Golden Era_- the 50s and 60s, when everything was new. Having old parents fed it, too; both were born in 1950, and all of their favorite automotive experiences were at least three decades behind them.

_Fifty-seven Chevy_was one of the first things I could reliably say.

I went to classic car shows, thrasher's unions, and vintage tractor pulls. A fair was literally nothing to me without at least one of them.

The only die-casts I ever paid any mind were all recreations of products designed before 1970, certainly.

My first life goal was probably to operate a John Deere 4020 - the '57 Chevrolet of tractors, if you will. It came from a time when even agricultural companies had design departments. My Uncle helped me realize that dream

The object I dreamed most of owning was a John Deere Model A. I had a reprint of its owner's and service manuals that I used to read on the toilet. They inspired some of my first stories.
