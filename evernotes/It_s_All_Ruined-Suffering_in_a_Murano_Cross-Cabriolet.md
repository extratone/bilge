# It's All Ruined: Suffering in a Murano Cross-Cabriolet

`legacy`

Here we are again.Â 

A new look; the same totally nonsensical content. What have I been doing? I don't know. Last night, we spent some time with the only objectively unbuyable automobile to be recently available for sale, and discovered that our neighborly Columbians are even more fashion-ignorant than we thought.

The Nissan Murano Cross-Cabriolet is a total bother. The standard crossover - as we discovered last night - is well-executed and pleasant...with a roof. Unfortunately, somebody in recent history must've said "what if we made a convertible crossover?" This is filth, yes, but what's _worse_ is that at least one separate individual did not _immediately act_ to stop him/her.

This is the fourth Nissan product I've turned into a personal joke.
