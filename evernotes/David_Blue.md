**What is your name? Can you tell me a little about the company you work for and your role in it?

**

My name is David Blue, and I am captain and creator of [extratone.com](http://extratone.com).

**Satirical Publications have been around since the late 1800’s, but have grown hugely popular since the internet and publications like The Onion. How do you feel this growth effects journalism and your news as a whole?**

**

**

I'd argue that satire has always had an essential presence in journalism - political cartoons in newsprint, for instance - it's just been allowed more variety and accessibility by the web. _Extratone _is not a wholly-satirical publication, but we do intermix plenty of comedy with the rest of our content. I think the growth you mentioned (along with our brand of magazine journalism) has prepared the readership to better understand the nuances in explicit and implicit satire - what is published to make you laugh, primarily, and what is not.

**While satire is comedy, there is often a legitimate amount of research one must do to make a successful article. Do you feel you face the same or similar challenges that traditional journalists face?**

Absolutely. Plenty of our content is written to sound ignorant, but it's rarely worthwhile if done so from a position of actual ignorance. I do my best to keep the pressures of news journalism out of our process - hard reporting doesn't need us - but some amount of research is always required for any kind of discussion to take place.

**Name one positive and one negative thing about Satirical Publications concerning Journalism and explain them each briefly, please.**

**

**

Satire has always been essential as a cheque on society's status quo. To understand an ideological or ethical argument, one must be exposed to as many perspectives as possible. Human beings cannot healthily take themselves and their ethics seriously, all of the time. It _can _be destructive, though. There are still readers out there who manage to take _The Onion_'s content seriously, for instance. May their God help them - I certainly can't.

**Do you enjoy the work you do? How does your audience receive it and have you gotten any negative feedback in the past?**

**

**

We're still just 5 months old, so our audience is fairly small. The vast majority of "negative" feedback we've received has been internal, which I call criticism, and crave incessantly. We did do a study on some NSFW copypasta fanfiction a few months ago which seemed to uh... confuse our readers a bit. I think it's a good thing.

**

**What future potential, if any, do you see for Satirical Publications and comedy within journalism in general?**

**

**

I think satire is as necessary to human life as air & water. Recently, we've been neglecting even those two, so who's to know, really?
