# Stair Tricks: Beyond Vegas

`legacy`

Who is Justin Lin? I know J.J.'s face. I know he needs a hat because his lenses are always flaring. His Lenses, which have he has so meticulously set upon fair Gene's ancient property - the one which has been with me far more consistently than any other.

Yes, I have been using the term “touchstone” recently, as I have been in a bit of a crises. (Hopefully not a mid-life one.) I believe a worthy preface for this text is this: Star Trek has been an unquestionable touchstone for me. Truthfully, it has made me cry more than anything on-screen, and blogging is - as far as I can make out - mostly confessional, so we're doin good. I'm sure I'll find more opportunities to lament on its presence in my life, but be assured: it is probably heavier in my life than in yours. For better or worse, confrontational or not, it is likely the truth.

To begin, let's get some unoriginal restatement out of the way:_Star Trek Beyond_is not altogether exploratory, so yeah… it is_beyond_very little. This is what you'll have been reading, assuming you've been consuming other words on the subject. It isn't particularly relevant, though. I've had to Google the title of the film repeatedly. Apparently, it's too petty to be worthy of retention.

To be perfectly honest, I adored this film for a single, perhaps bizarre-seeming rationale: the crux of the main conflict - the secret weapon, if you will - is noise. An old ship broadcasting an ancient Beastie Boys track is the singular decider of the final odds. It could not have been more perfectly tailored to my affection. I thought you should know.
