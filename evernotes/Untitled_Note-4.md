# Untitled Note

`legacy`

I don't know,Â 

but the future got vague

suddenly,

things came out that we'd never understand

see the billowing and we dread,

and I applaud paired faces in vitro obscura

eyes, unaverting,

teaching me courage

too late to stay

too late to live?

I have lived; not this way

I will be a witness;

I will not look away
