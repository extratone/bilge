# Give Voice to Hunger

`legacy`

If you must engage with corporate food service accounts, I'd suggest offerings from McDonald's Arabia. 

"Need" is only a form of want, and I want to die.

**A young white man named Carter requires your immediate assistance. **

I've got something very newsworthy and supremely engaging for you.

The world today is a wealth of topics and perspectives, but daily biological functions are universal. Everybody gets hungry, and we are in the everybody business!

[Carter Wilkerson](https://secure2.convio.net/pbwh/site/Donation2?df_id=4768&4768.donation=form1) has been hungry for some time now, according to someone familiar with the matter. Yesterday, in agony, he resolved within himself to cease the toleration of his famine, and bravely typed a message on Twitter to Wendy's - a national chain of restaurants where people often eat - pleading for justice. He wanted to know just _how many supporters_ would have to stand up for his wellbeing before the company would do _the right thing_, and provide him his deserved nuggets. As the whole world watched, they [replied](https://www.one.org/us/take-action/): 18 million retweets, and Carter will be able to eat.

Helping Carter is very easy: just retweet!

You won't just be helping him, either. You'll be letting all of your followers know - along with anyone stopping by your profile - that you like it when people eat, and that _you like to eat, too!_ That passerby might just be looking for someone who _also_ likes to eat and decide to follow you!

**Bonus!**

The [previous retweet record](http://www.mealsonwheelsamerica.org/take-action) is about three million, so it's going to take a lot of supportive allies, but hey - what's more important than eating!? I love eating and food more than anything else in the world, and that sentiment - as well as sharing it with others - is an essential component of my identity. I'm so lucky that my lifetime is spanning the greatest renaissance in the history of human communication. Without intellectually and culturally enriching technologies like Twitter, how would Carter tell the world that he is hungry?!

How would _I_?

Thanks in large part to our generation, the exchange of ideas is more democratized than ever, and Twitter has played a huge role in establishing today's current social media palette. If the speculation as to the likelihood of its demise has any basis in reality, perhaps its time for us to begin securing its legacy. 

I don't know about you, but _I_ want to be remembered for my food memes, not my stance on whatever current affairs garbage happened to be bouncing around.

Regimes, ideologies, public figures, corporate entities, and human lives come and go, but I will _always_ have to eat!

I mean, _come on._

I don't give a shit about Syria; I'm hungry!

And _you don't want to talk to me when I'm hungry_! I lose all self-awareness and abandon any control of my person!

My friends (the ones who like to eat) and I have been using a new word we made up to describe this primal, pitiful state of being: _hangry. __Hungry_ and _angry_! The best jokes are always the ones involving the consumption of food and its tremendous power over my life.

_Hangry_ me? Unprincipled. Rabid.

A thief? Possibly.

A liar? Probably.

An abuser? Who knows?!

**Food is everything to me, and meals are the milemarkers of my life.**

_What am I doing after I finish this piece?_

I'm going to eat.

_What would I do if you walked in the room at this moment with a delicious, gooey chocolate cupcake?_

Abandon the job, of course!

And give you everything.
