# HP Spectre x360 Convertible

`legacy`

-Spectre is genuinely courageous and luxurious designÂ 

-SEXY???

-"Seductive power"

-Monospace logo

-_Ash Silver_

_-_Heavier than last years, with a 6th-gen i7 and a bulkier bezel, but honestly... the monospace is worth it, as weight and grunt were not major considerations for me.

-Pic of the compaq key on top.

-I've never owned a personal computer I could dress to match before.

-Audio sensation from my QC15s is wonderful.

-Ports!

-First boot begins with a very gradual fade-in "Hi"

-Physically touching the internet. "Learning again how to touch the web."

-It's certainly not always silent, but when it is... It's quite eerie.

-Occasional touch screen glitches.

I'd like to think that at least a portion of the boldness brought to the market in the Spectre marque was found by HP whilst stacking Big Data in a cobwebbed corner of their new summer retreat - COMPAQ's lonesome Texan home - after eloping South from the still-debris-covered Wall Street chapel where they'd been conjoined for All Time in corporate matrimony.

Perhaps it was in the soil.

It slowed our timid, ABS-oblivious society to ten percent or less of its already near-postmortem pace.
