`legacy`

You may have been aware that [_The Movie Closet_](http://extratone.com/moviecloset)'s creator, [Ben Stokes](https://twitter.com/BennyBeats111), is an artist, by trade.

This summer, he'll be illustrating a bi-weekly webcomic with words by Bryan Nelson, called

_Harvey T. Halloway._

Harvey is an insectoid-humanoid detective, and his neo-noir, black and white world is not in poverty of detail, by any means.
