Columbia, Mo-U Knead Sweets, a family-owned bakery, opened last September half a block west of Ninth Street in downtown Columbia.

Helena and Allen Shih, the owners of U Knead Sweets, founded the shop after working at Yen Ching’s in Jefferson City. Erica Shih, their daughter, balances helping at the shop with her studies at the University of Missouri. She was with her mother when the idea was first conceived.

“We were walking downtown a few years ago, and we saw the building was up for lease,” she said.

Helena had long dreamt of running her own bakery. After a short period of consideration, the family committed to opening the shop.

“They put everything into it,” said Shih of her parents.

The deadline for opening was set for the weekend of last year’s Roots & Blues festival, in anticipation of greater traffic. Preparation was rushed, but they found success.

“We got a lot of good business that way,” she said.

Since their opening, business has been fairly regular. The wide variety of customers are often brought in by word of mouth. Shih has overheard discussion regarding “the new bakery downtown” when walking about campus. Regular visitors also include locals making large orders for their office breakfast.

U Knead Sweets aspires to bring a unique offering to the area, with a focus on moderating sugar content and Asian-acquired pastries. The family values their preparation process.

“We make everything from scratch here,” explained Shih.

The result is pleasing to Josh Browne, who is a recently-hired assistant at U Knead Sweets.

“I love the food here. I think it’s probably one of the best bakeries in town.”

Browne applied for a job at the bakery after hearing that they needed a dishwasher. He was hired three weeks ago, and enjoys working for the family.

“I like working here. They let me do my job,” he said.

U Knead Sweets offers catering and delivery services, as well as the opportunity to sit in a restaurant setting.
