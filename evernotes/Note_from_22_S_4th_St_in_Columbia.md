# Note from 22 S 4th St in Columbia

`legacy`

-Christmas is a great bit more patriotic than July 4th.

-Everything we touch is mediocre. Everything we drink is mediocre. Most of the gifts we exchange are mediocre, as is all we find ourselves asking for from family, friends, and existence. And we all know it, but never waiver from it, because mediocre is what we do.

-Apple had been perfecting mediocrity not out of malice, but servitude. They are dutifully delivering and diligently studying what you ask for, nothing more.

My mom graciously decided to take me mall shopping for Christmas, which is comforting in its tradition of vapid routine. The state of a given midwestern metropolis's mall is a keen indicator of the culture's soul, I've found, and ours is mostly crewed by destitute alcoholics, who are my closest kin, and therefore my most appropriate company for _the holidays_.

Dillard's is the second-best place to lose your mind in America, even now, when the somber corners are not quite so desolate. The acoustic sensation cannot be experienced anywhere else - the battlecries of the Me Generation's pop reproduced by hateful diaphragms behind their white plastic ceiling facades and absorbed again by palletloads of mass-manufactured stonewashed denim, seemingly coming from a far-off wholesale nether no matter where in the store you've been buried. Ours is a few decades old, now - weathered and alone, which accentuates the whole dystopia with a resolute air of infinity, as if it's certain it will outlast me. It probably will.

I was deep within it all when I came across Dieter Bohn's praising review of the HP Spectre x360. As I've constantly confessed, _The Verge_'s lot are the only institution of their kind I've come close to trusting _too much_, so
