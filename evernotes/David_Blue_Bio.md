David Blue is the Founder and Editor-in-Chief of _Extratone _and the originator of "Drywall," the counter-counterculture from which it formed. His work has thus far been defined by his chronologically-inappropriate use of the phrase "good morning."

Editor-in-Chief David Blue brings us along for the journey as he attempts to tackle the blog medium and his tediously-fickle intellect simultaneously.
