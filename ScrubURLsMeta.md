## A simple utility for cleaning unnecessary information (? and what‘s after it) from a URL.

## About

Unfortunately, this is *not* the Ultimate Link Cleaner utility I have aspired to make for as long as I‘ve curated web content in various forms, but it will at least reliably perform one function: removing “tracking“ metadata (? and the stuff after it) by disassembling a given URL and reassembling *only* the host and the path. That‘s it. It will *not* function if redirection is involved.

### Functions

**As configured by default...** 
(Subject to your preference!)

1. Retrieves current clipboard
2. Finds the host (host.com) in the URL
3. Finds the path (/path) in the URL
4. Combines the raw text of the host and the path to (hopefully) form a link without a scheme (host.com/path)
5. Recognizes this raw text as a real URL, adding a scheme (http://host.com/path.)
6. Copies the result to the clipboard
