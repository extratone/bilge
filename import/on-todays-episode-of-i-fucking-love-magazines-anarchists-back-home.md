I just inadvertently lost two and a half hours combing through three _Wikipedia categories_, of all things: Magazines published in [California](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Magazines_published_in_California), in [Oregon](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Magazines_published_in_Oregon), and in [Missouri](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Magazines_published_in_Missouri). (I’m currently exercising huge restraint to keep from exploring further through the Southern states - especially [Texas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Magazines_published_in_Texas) and [Louisiana](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Magazines_published_in_Louisiana).) It’s proved absolutely facinating, but very somber as well - many or most of the publications across these lists went defunct before 2016. Some have even been jacked of their archives by ad-plastered stop pages or indie clothing brands, but I’m not going to beg you to justify for me why these things must come to pass for obscure trade journals (even for those with ultra-sexy titles like _Test & Measurement World_, _Light Metal Age_, or _Trailer Life_,) print-dependent punk bi-weeklies, and Commodore 64 disk magazines. Instead, I'd simply complain about the loss of revolutionary or generally innovative projects like these while age-old hags carrying age-old ideas like _Reason_ have continued more or less unencumbered.

_(Imagines Ayn Rand reading the words "_**SHOP REASON SWAG**_" over and over again with building terror.)_

On that note, I find it especially bizarre that some anarchist fellow named Jason McQuinn was able to amass enough of a community in my little hometown to call themselves the "[Columbia Anarchist League](http://www.committee-for-transcendence.org/Committee-for-Transcendence/AsWeSeeIt/AsWeSeeIt.htm)" and publish a [periodical](http://anarchymag.org/) from the area with a quite-rousing title without my knowledge at all.

Though he'd long departed Columbia for the West Coast by the time I was an adult, it would seem he was around as late as September 1998, which shouldn't have left enough time for his name to disappear from the minds of my instructors in high school or the University of Missouri's professors, at least, given the esteemed reputation of its Journalism School. And yet - even throughout my most ideologically-activated teenhood, I never once heard it mentioned that such an individual and/or organization had ever been at work in their proximity. The only photo I could find of Jason McQuinn was on Wikipedia commons and I'd say I recognize him from somewhere, but he honestly looks _exactly_ the same as all 40, 50, 60-something white guys do in the Midwest.

Now, though, I'd like to share my journey through those lists (and the rest of my iPhone battery's remaining charge) via screenshots of the great many which stood out.

Make no mistake: **this** **is as good as publishing gets, folks** . While wandering through endless broken or archived links, I also found the cleverly-named LiveJournal Editor’s Life Unedited, to which I can already relate more than anything or anyone else I’ve ever encountered in this existence.
