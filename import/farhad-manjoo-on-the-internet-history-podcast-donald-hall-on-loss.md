"[When technology became cool again](https://www.salon.com/2004/12/27/year_in_technology_2004/)" - _Salon_     
"[Blog-rolling for votes and dollars](https://www.salon.com/2004/06/09/blog_ads/)" - Farhad Manjoo, _Salon_

"I've been doing essentially the same job of writing a weekly tech column since I started at _Salon_﻿, which was 2008."

Definition of a tech columnist: "part explainer, part futurist, part moralist, and part advocate for users of technology."

I shoulda known it was Farhad who killed gadget blogging... Though I do agree that Kara Swisher is very good.

"There's nothing an 'expert' can do on Alexa that an 'amateur' can't do."

These are the whitest, most core literary conversations in the history of the world, but they're also some of the sweetest.

without autumn  
no spring no summer no autumn no winter  
no rain no peony thunder no woodthrush  
the book is a thousand pages without commas  
without mice maple leaves windstorms  
no castles no plazas no flags no parrots  
without carnival or the procession of relics  
intolerable without brackets or colons  
silence without color sound without smell  
without apples without pork to rupture gnash  
unpunctuated without churches uninterrupted  
no orioles ginger noses no opera no  
without fingers daffodils cheekbones  
the body is a nation a tribe dug into stone  
assaulted white blood broken to fragments  
provinces invade bomb shoot shell  
strafe execute rape retreat and attack  
artillery sniper fire helicopter gunship  
grenade burning murder landmine starvation  
the ceasefire lasts forty-eight hours  
then a shell explodes in a market  
pain vomit neuropathy morphine nightmare  
confusion terror the rack the screw  
vincristine ara-c cytoxan vp-16  
loss of memory loss of language losses  
  
foamless unmitigated sea without sea  
delirium whipmarks of petechiae pcp  
multiple blisters of herpes zoster  
and how are you doing today i am doing  
one afternoon say the sun comes out  
moss takes on greenishness leaves fall  
the market opens a loaf of bread a sparrow  
a bony dog wanders back sniffing a lath  
it might be possible to pick up a pencil  
unwritten stanzas taken up and touched  
beautiful terrible sentences unuttered  
the sea unrelenting wave gray the sea  
flotsam without islands broken crates  
block after block the same house the mall  
no cathedral no hobo jungle the same women  
and men they long to drink hayfields  
without dog or semicolon or village square  
without monkey or lily without garlic  
\- [_Without_](http://articles.latimes.com/1996-11-10/books/bk-63233_1_donald-hall), by Donald Hall

Only this strange combination of completely unrelated podcast episodes could lead to the realization that Terry Gross and Kara Swisher sound like they could or should be sisters.
