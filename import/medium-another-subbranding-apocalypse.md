What the fuck is a "Sub Brand?"

_Shife_ is a subbrand. [_Words of David Blue in Red_](http://extratone.com/words/inred) is also a subbrand of mine, and I've decided to experiment with it by distributing it on Medium via a "[personal publication](https://medium.com/redletters/hello-90ae21ea7604)" for a variety of reasons.

* [This man said I should](https://medium.com/swlh/why-you-should-be-a-publication-on-medium-3682088f963).
* My own [design goals](http://www.extratone.com/meta/16/) for _Extratone_ made sure it would never provide the opportunity to experiment with Medium publications from the get-go.
* I'm already trying out a [Medium membership](http://www.niemanlab.org/2017/03/media-is-broken-so-mediums-launching-a-5month-member-program-that-offers-small-upgrades/) with the intent the write a column about its user experience and how it's changed from the perspectives of the reader, member, _and_ ﻿publisher.
* I'm apparently an enthusiastic Gimp poweruser, addicted to cranking out a rough-but-extensive rack of digital assets in a single morning.

Just this evening, I discovered Schick Toikka's [Saol Display](https://www.schick-toikka.com/saol-display) via [this Tweet from _Typographica_](https://twitter.com/typographica/status/1017303523329888257) and I'm Fucking In Love. I used Vivaldi screen captures of their sampler to create a few banner logos for Red Letters at a lower resolution than I'd prefer for "brand assets," but since this whole thing is an experiment and I haven't actually bought the typeface, I shan't complain. While we're on the subject - I actually created these super-cool, _HP Journal_ -sourced promotional panels for the column two weeks ago using the same IBM corporate typeface this blog wears \(Plex.\)

Custom dropcaps are easier than I remembered/expected - I can't recall how much I've actually played around with Medium composition in the past - and [_Electric Literature_](https://electricliterature.com/) definitely has the best I've seen thus far.

Also, the post from that sample - "[How Writing Closed Captions Turned Me off TV For Good](https://electricliterature.com/how-writing-closed-captions-turned-me-off-tv-for-good-dd38c39929df)" - is probably the best thing I've yet read on Medium.

I don't know how many other folks actually listen to _Tomorrow with Joshua Topolsky_ \(though you'll note the show has less than 3000 followers [on SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/tomorrowpodcast)\) and [_The Vergecast_](https://www.theverge.com/the-vergecast), but I do regularly and have for nearly three years now - perhaps I have some odd attachment with the _Engadget_ - _Vox Media_ - _The Outline_ sphere. Over time, [Paul Miller](https://twitter.com/futurepaul) has become one of my favorite tech journalists as perhaps the token small-government Christian Republican of this community, yet I somehow missed [his appearance on _Tomorrow_ in 2016](https://soundcloud.com/tomorrowpodcast/episode-54-tough-love-with-paul-miller), when he... unfortunately... said "I love \[Donald Trump's\] position on Mexicans," but then immediately followed up with an insightful comparison of our new POTUS with Kanye West. The thing with Paul is that he's only explicitly mentioned his contentious \(as far as New Media goes\) positions once, when asked on this podcast, and it's inevitably tough to listen to and even tougher to read the sparse SoundCloud comments.
