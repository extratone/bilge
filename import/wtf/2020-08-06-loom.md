From Loom's [Press page](https://www.loom.com/press):

> Loom is a new kind of work communication tool that helps people get their messages across through instantly shareable videos. With Loom, you can capture your screen, record your front-facing camera, and narrate your video all at once — no switching apps or upload required. Whether it’s training new teammates or replying to a customer inquiry, Loom enhances the way people communicate at work by allowing them to send the next best thing to being there. Founded in 2016, Loom has hundreds of thousands of active users and is backed by Point Nine Capital, General Catalyst, and the Slack Fund.

I tried the [14-day trial](https://www.loom.com/pricing) of Loom's "Pro" tier, which includes custom video resolutions. In that time, I was able to record several demos using Loom's [desktop app](https://www.loom.com/desktop) on Windows. I also nabbed a few with Loom's [iOS app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/loom-screen-recordings-more/id1474480829). I've found almost all of them useful elsewhere and have organized them into a publicly-shareable folder called "**[Software Demonstration](https://loom.com/share/folder/75c1347dd92943b5be991ca76fe00483)**."

## Embedding

The above is an example of a "responsive" embed. It's the only opportunity I had to actually use my microphone. I was unable to capture any webcam video at all because I broke the driver for my Surface Laptop's 2's integrated camera recently and haven't been able to figure out how to fix it.

Here's an example of a fixed-dimension embed of a video recorded on iOS:

## Comment

Loom reminds me abstractly of [Puush](https://puush.me/register) - an ultra-smooth screen grab service all of the most e-enabled Twitter youths used back in the day (~2010-2014) ((huge thanks to [Brady](https://twitter.com/bradyjhenry/status/1291448890286174208) and [Isiah](https://twitter.com/ammnontet/status/1291453336860860416) for actually helping my memory)) - that allowed one to use a hotkey, draw a rectangle, release, and it would instantly upload the image file + copy a link to the clipboard without any further input. On both of the platforms on which I tried it, the events following "Stop Recording" are where Loom really shines: uploads seemed like magic (on my connection, anyway.)

Ultimately, I'm sure there are definitely folks for whom Loom is unparalleled in a very specific day-to-day workflow necessitating repeated screen capture in small clips, shared in real time. I just hope those users are able to discover it and that its business proves sustainable.
