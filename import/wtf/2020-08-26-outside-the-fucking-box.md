Mr. Drake paused, swiveling his gaze on his heels, gray eyes wide. In the rear, Liam scoffed loudly over the disinterested silence, slouched all the way back in his rigid chair and hoisting his legs to cross them on Barney’s left shoulder.

“Ay, YO TEECH,” he yelled in Mr. Drake’s general direction, glancing left and right. “YO TEECH, you blaze tron?”\[efn\_note\]It should be noted that Liam Libel was wholly, thoroughly, obviously, unquestionably white.\[/efn\_note\]

Mr. Drake, frozen in the forward stoop he’d been glaring from, offered no reply. Barney brushed briskly at Liam’s Converses against his head as if they were a lost lunar moth.

“Yo teech, you just tell me if you want a little somun somun, you know what I mean,” Liam said, _Ha Ha_ing with his right hand eclipsed over his smile.

“Dude,” Barney complained. Libel sat up again and returned his feet to the floor, but didn’t otherwise acknowledge the protest. He threw his right arm into an arc over his head and made his hand into a vague pistol shape, pointed at Mr. Drake.

“Ay, YO TEECH… BET YOU NEVA HEARDA GOVENA RON PAUL… Ha ha! YOU AND THIS WHOLE COUNTRY… THIS COUNTRY GOIN TO SHIT, _MAN_.”

Mr. Drake self-consciously returned to standing upright, but his eyes looked miles beyond the far wall and his students – thirty-one of whom had yet to react at all.

“Why is it ALWAYS BOXES, _man_? What’s with the FUCKIN BOXES? YO TEECH, THIS SOME BULLSHIT.”

Barney set about gathering his things to escape the tirade, but Liam had begun to violently writhe about in his chair and appeared to be quickly descending into a fit, which exponentially slowed Blimp’s organization.

“DON’T DO THIS, TEECH. DON’T LABEL ME!”

His whole body was convulsing now and his magazines were bounding and bouncing toward serious altitudes on top of him like wheat chaff as it’s shaken free of the grain.

"AY YO TEECH… WHY YOU GOTTA PUT THESE CAGES ON US? LEMME BLOW YOUR MIND RIGHT QUICK."

And with that, his chair failed him as he shook to the ground on his hands and knees – still hollering in bodily tumult.

"COME ONNNN_NNNN_ TEECH, YOU KNOW I CAN’T FIT IN YOUR REPUBLICRAT BOX,” he spat at the rug. Neither Mr. Drake nor his pupils had moved or expressed anything, save for Barney Blimp, who stepped over Liam Libel with his backpack and threaded his way strenuously through the desks and static legs, feet, and empty faces through the door. A hundred yards down the hallway, as he leaned against the exit, a final croaking throw came from behind him.

“_Ron Pal!_”

The creaking of the exit door – hinges wanting for a greasing – and the _swooshing_ of its bottom seal against the muddy black shoemat yielded not for Barney Blimp the fresh Colorado air and lucid sunshine, but instead – through a haze of drug-numbed internal retching and destruction – the stagnantly sterile, ammonia’d atmosphere and lifeless colors of a meager hospital room. From the open hallway to his left came an ambiently echoing broadcast of unexpected contextual quality.

“Welcome, Frances Fujica Chamberlain, eleven pounds, six ounces,” said a theatrically raspy woman’s voice, followed by a pleasantly rhythmic rock sample.\[efn\_note\]Specifically, from the slightly-altered chorus of a 1976 cover by Mannfred Mann’s Earth Band of Bruce Springsteen’s 1972 original that found significantly more success – reaching number 1 on _Billboard_’s “Hot 100” in the U.S.\[/efn\_note\]

“_BLINDed by the light_ / _revved up like a deuce_ / _another roller in the night!_”

Yet, it was the tiny wall-mounted television that captured Barney’s newly-awoken, moderately-medicated attention. From diagonally across his tall bed with its faded floral sheets and itchy medium blue comforter, the minuscule CRT blared a top-of-the-hour _Good Morning America_ graphic.

“Good morning, America. Breaking news, the FBI takes on Apple demanding the tech giant help with a terror investigation. Are critical clues to more plots hidden on the phone of the San Bernardino shooters? Why Apple's CEO is refusing to help this morning. A battle that could affect everyone with a smartphone,” said the voice of the aging anchor from under a dyed black combover to whom the introduction transitioned along with a lower third graphic that said “JAKE JINGLES, ABC NEWS.” _Apparently, it is the morning_, thought Barney Blimp.

“Good morning,” he whispered. Jake Jingles and his co-host Jaime Jangles then went on about the idiosyncrasies of the G.O.P., quoted and played back a clip of the current President saying _I believe so and so will never be President_, then a shorter clip of “BJ, a German Shorthaired Pointer” – clearly somewhere else in the studio, sitting obediently, cocking his head at the approaching camera lens – before finally returning to a wide-shot of Jingles and Jangles sitting abreast, smiling off screen at the dog.

“All right, and good morning, America. There he is, BJ, the winner of the Eastminster Kennel Club's Best in Show Award. He's just arriving here in Times Square. He took a walk there on our green carpet in case you missed it. We cannot wait to meet the top dog coming up. Hear what he has to say about his win. The biggest bone of all.”

“A great-looking dog.”

“He walks like a winner.”

“He is.”

“Absolutely.”

“Amazing,” said Barney Blimp, all at once noticing how uncomfortable his entire physical being had been left in its current, awfully-upright position against a mountain of pillows that looked promising, but disappointingly lacked fulfilling qualities one tends to hope for and enjoy in promising-looking pillows. He lifted his rear to scoot it down and felt an unsettling tremor of his out of kilter equilibrium atop faint whole-body pins and needles from – no doubt – remaining more or less stationary for hours?...days?

“…have more on that later. But right now lots of reaction coming in overnight to that emotional appearance in the White House briefing room from Chief of Staff Eggs White. The former general raw and red-eyed as he defended the President, attacked his critics, and remembered the death of his own son on the battlefield. Chief White House correspondent Geoffrey Gouge starts us off. Good morning, Geoff…”

Realizing the excess of the television’s current volume was insistently coercing the entirety of his attention, Barney looked about him – despite the dizziness – searching for the remote control. To his left, there was only empty space and the burst of brief, sickly draft from a cycle of the neighboring Intensive Care Unit airlock; to his right, a substantially loaded IV pole holding both black and translucent liquid bags, and a hang-over eating tray on castors which was – quite strangely – surfaced in a bright, neon-green neoprene, and contained a small-book-sized touch tablet. He reached for it, tapping the black screen with his right index finger’s plastic heart-rate monitor in an attempt to illicit life. After a few clumsy tries, he achieved a sort of success: an awkward, large-print menu faded into view with five haphazardly off-center options next to hopelessly-scaled stock graphics: _DRUGS_, _MEDIA_, _BILLING_, _SCHEDULING_, and _SUPPORT_. Barney tried _MEDIA_, but the subsequently displayed controls were muted somehow – left transparent. No amount of tapping yielded any change in the program, which had turned to a montage of B-roll: red-faced parents talking on mobile phones on the black asphalt – crowded to the point of insanity by neutral-colored SUVs outside a sprawling red brick building sprouting the tiniest trickle of gray smoke from the far wing.

“The driver, look at this, pulled over after he smelled smoke, and that's when flames erupted.  More than a dozen students from the Jacksonville area high school had to evacuate. One person was treated for smoke inhalation. The children were picked up by a different bus and taken home. No word on what caused this in the first place, but certainly glad everyone is okay this morning, Jake.”

“Thank goodness for that. And now to that big win overnight for the Los Angeles Dodgers, heading to their first World Series since 1988,” continued Jake Jingles as the slightest electronic pseudodance percussion was subtly faded behind his voice in the background – its 140 beat-per-minute high hats abnormally flattered by the bias of the pitiful speakers within the wall-mounted unit, furthering Blimp’s aggravation with the situation. He amplified his aggression toward the tablet, holding it just inches from his nose as he pounded his fingers on the glass. The original menu came briefly back into view before the _DRUGS_ option was selected, swapping the theme entirely for microscopic, illegible text and alarmingly primary reds. The unassuming white plastic pump suspended in the middle of his IV pole suddenly clicked and began a drawling, whirred chugging. Panicking at the sound and the new movements of fluids he perceived, Barney vigorously attacked the big red _X_ in the top-right corner with every ounce of available effort left in the stumps of his thumbs, and was – to his gracious relief – rewarded with the cessation of the horrors.

“…guy behind looked so concerned until the last second. Also right now a lot of reaction coming to that emotional moment in the White House press briefing room. Chief of Staff General White, defending the President's calls to the families of fallen soldiers. Also took on the President's critics and opened up about the loss of his own son on the battlefield…”

Barney Blimp sighed in extreme exasperation and threw the tablet down on the tray, sinking under the sheets until his feet felt the footboard and hung over it, both hands desperately gripping the comforter, pulling it over his nose so that only his eyes-up were exposed. A new wave of drowsiness gushed from his numb belly and washed over him like sleepy molasses, tinging his vision light blue as he tilted it with his head on the flat bed below the pillow mountain to focus on a single one of the ceiling tile’s dark red polka-dots. _Spackled blood_, he thought – the removed Observer of his consciousness noting how much less anxious he was in the moment than he should’ve rationally been, while knowing, of course, that his state was entirely the result of whatever drugs they had him on.

“Welcome, Leslie Désirée Lund, eight pounds four ounces… _BLINDed by the light_…”

Barney Blimp’s eyes drooped heavy as his Observer ceased short its attempt to recollect the sequence of events which led him there – wherever _there_ was – it was a bed… a less-than-moderately comfortable bed… and instead considered the definition of “roller” in “_another roller in the night_.” Not _roller_ as in “high _roller_,” no. Not “_roller_ blades,” though it… he… _they_ had always wanted to learn how to inline skate… _Aggressive_ inlines. Speed skating was such an elegant, lost art. Why weren’t there more speed skaters swooping and sliding around, bent over with their hands behind their backs to cut through the air oh-so-beautifully… in all State and National parks… in cardigans… and purple sweatbands? _What happened to them all?_

“…and after the break, Jaime and I sit down with Theodore Pith, the young artificial intelligence pioneer and mogul, now author of a new book about cheese and the end of the world…”

R-o-l-l-e-r, _roller_. A flour-dusted light wood cylinder with matching old style handles, loose… Loose, but that’s how they were supposed to be… how they had to be or else it would not roll separately of them… Except it was _huge_, and growing! Gargantuan! And the hands! Covered in dark black hairs of a simply _vulgar_ length and nearly as big… Bringing the overwhelming girth of the surface – the _much_ too _solid_ and _threatening_ surface – to flatten his body! Rhythmically rolling and squishing and flattening Barney Blimp and his organs against this awful, foreign bed like _fucking dough!_ He was more conscious now, but still unable to move – completely paralyzed… And the hellish utensil was on its way back again! _Revved up like a deuce…_ _The toes_, he remembered! He and his Observer concentrated everything they had on wiggling their toes… _really_ wiggling… and finally… they wiggled alive!

Liberated from his dream and waking paralysis, Barney shot up – sheets, comforter, tubes, cables, and all – inhaling massively only to see on the tiny wall television the pale, smiling face, flashing green eyes, and blood-red hair of his new boss sitting cross-legged in a purple chair astride the _GMA_ watermark as the show returned from a commercial break. Opposite a table packed with granite-looking half-pipes full of steaming brown beans were the smooth faces of Jake Jingles and Jaime Jangles.

“Here with us in the studio this morning is Theodore Pith, author of the new, quite controversial but hot-selling book – especially here in New York, _The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse Are Varieties of Cheese: How Your Foodism Will End Everything_,” said Jake Jingles with occasion.

_Fuck_, mouthed Barney Blimp.

“…and the new owner of the renamed Manhattan barbecue joints, Pith's Chili Trough and Pith's Chili Playpen. We've got what looks to be a... Ha ha, well... a miniature _trough_ of chili right here in front of us. Wow! A lot to dive into, for sure, but first, Mr. Pith... Your book seems well… It seems to be in direct opposition to what I see and smell in front of me. That is cheese on that chili, right?”

“SON OF A _FUCKING BITCH!”_ screamed Barney, hoarsely. His hands moved to fumble with the tablet again, mouth agape as Jake Jingles fumbled similarly in propping an obnoxiously-covered volume upright for the camera, on screen, struggling to obscure an apparently-obscene illustration of a nude woman covered in cheese – his right hand accomplishing the censorship of all but her cheese-strung feet behind the title text.

“Yes, that's an understandable contrast to make, Jack,” Pith answered as the broadcast switched to his full-shot angle. He himself was deeply contrasted with the formal wear of everyone present – save for some of the studio audience, perhaps – with his pale, freckled arms sticking out of a plain white t-shirt which said on its front in a loud, large, simple sans-serif typeface _TODAY IS SATURDAY, MARCH 10TH._

“First, I'd like to say how wonderful it is to be here above the beautiful Time Squared... Wow! You guys have a great audience. Hiya, folks! Love you guys! Don't be shy – get your hands dirty! It's Chili Day!”

Theodore Pith waved wildly and dumbly, gyrating both palms at the present audience, off screen, who whooped and cheered in response. Their audience camera was clumsily cut to a bit later than it should’ve been. Jake Jingles forced a chuckle.

“Well, there it is... You've got to love that humor! Was it part of promoting the book, buying these restaurants or was the timing just a coincidence?”

Jaime Jangles chimed in with an addendum, first two right fingers drumming on her chin.

“And has the tour got you jetlagged, or was your shirt part of the promotion, too? What kind of a shirt is that?” She gestured toward his torso, emptily smiling.

“First of all, yes that is true, free-range American cheese grated into your chili, there... I'm actually going to start digging in, if you don't mind,” Theodore Pith said, shoving the provided logo-adorned bib under his right thigh.

“No, of course... I think I'll join right in with ya,” replied Jake, who sat forward and looked helplessly at the massive task before him.

“I, myself, really don't find the book's argument in conflict with my love of- and affection for chili, particularly.” He threaded the provided (and also logo-adorned) garden trowel under a great yellow-brownish gop of beans and scooped it toward his maw, spilling a few ounces on the oversaturated rug. Jake Jingles was having one hell of a time shoving his own logo-adorned bib into the front of his shirt without rubbing his live lapel microphone unnecessarily.

“That argument being – as I understand having read as much as I could last night – that our obsession with food is... Well, sort of rampant and infecting our culture-”

“...and stealing attention from important efforts in humanitarian policy, charity, et cetera, yes, but when you _do_ finish the book – and I really hope you do, George, really… – you’ll have been taken through my conclusion, which is, essentially, that it is by now our delicious, gluttonous, organic Rome's time to fall, if you’re catching my drift.”

Barney Blimp was now a reddening, rigid live wire – his fury crossing a threshold in his heart monitor, setting off its alarm in triads. _Beepbeepbeep_.

Jake Jingles – now equipped properly with logo-adorned bib – looked across the table in building agitation at Theodore Pith, twirling his clean trowel. From beside him, Jaime Jangles – yet to be misnamed, and thus slightly less huffy – offered her intermediation.

“I have to say... I haven't gotten to read the book yet, but I really love my Me Food – I happen to know that Jake, here, loves his _even more_, and it's hurtful, the suggestion that my interest in good food is somehow wrong or dangerous-”

“...oh, James! Don't look so bashful! Please, do eat your chili!”

There was a great, gaping, deadly live television pause filled with the swishing and swashing of the pale Pith’s rhythmic chewing over the 140 beat-per-minute electro beat, his otherwise quiet person in frame, t-shirt now covered in brown, eyes cast downward to the half-empty trough before him.

Jaime Jangles cleared her throat.

“I’m Jaime, actually…”

The eyes came up with a full mouth, from which hung a six-inch-long string of cheese.

“...oh shit, I'm so sorry! That's really embarrassing...”

Theodore Pith looked to her, then to the camera and back. Behind the camera, the audience conveyed together both amused applause and inverbal admonishment.

“Jaime, please let me make it up to you… have some of _my_ chili!”

Jingles and Jangles cringed, smiled, and managed chuckles with all the restraint in the world.

“Hey, now! There are families watching this live, Mr.- ”

“…gosh, I am so sorry.”

Theodore looked to the camera covered in chili as the shot cycled back to him.

“Kids, you should know that profanity is nothing by the byproduct of laziness. True eloquence is-”

“…let’s just try and get back to the book, alright?”

“Sure, sure... It's really exciting to see it finally going off the shelves after all these weeks, you know. Writing something like this is grueling stuff.”

The triplets of the Barney Blimp alarm had finally summoned a disheveled young orderly, who bussed immediately around the dismal bed to cease it in a blur of dark purple and Chanel No. 5.

“Good, good! It’s good to see you up… Barney-“

“Please turn off the television,” he said.

“… I’m sorry?”

“TURN _OFF_… the television. Turn off the TV, please.”

The orderly looked up from the tablet on her forearm to the screen, where Jaime Jangles was hesitantly playing with her little shovel.

“Wow, yes, I can't even visualize… How long did the process take, do you know?”

“At least three... Yeah, three weeks or so, last November I think it was,” to _wows_ from Jangles, Jingles, and the audience.

“For God’s sake, turn… it… _OFF!_”

“That's actually... really no time at all,” said Jake.

“Really quick,” nodded Jaime.

“OFF!” screamed Barney Blimp, in a single, swift motion picking up the tablet and hurling it – inches from the nurse’s nose – to a perfectly placed impact on the little TV, cracking its screen and inducing a brief blip of white noise blinds, yet neither the horrid appliance nor his visitor flinched a bit. The later calmly returned her attention to her own tablet, then to the IV pole’s machinery.

“Mr. Blimp, please try to control yourself.”

Jake Jingles again stiffly manipulated the bright-orange volume, turning it in profile and then over, very deliberately assuring that the cheesy woman be excluded from the shot.

“It's nearly five-hundred pages, right? And this is your first book?”

“First _published_ book under my own name, you know. I've written a few other things, here and there, but that's a subject for another time.”

_Aw_, said the audience.

“Sure, we’ve got to have you back some time,” said Jake Jingles with visible grit in his smile.

“Jesus,” said Barney Blimp.

“But, this apocalypse... Is it happening now? Soon? A hundred years in the future? Or...?”

“All three, really. We are here eating scrumptious, fifty-dollar chili while unprecedented numbers of people are starving, all over the world…”

“Mother_fucker._”

“…in Haiti, Namibia, North Korea, Zimbabwe, Detroit... And yet, we demand only the cleanest last few decimals of a percentage from the food on our own tables.”

Up went the young woman’s eyebrows as she tapped her tablet, unpainted fingernails clacking.

“Look, I’m sorry about the TV, but could you _please_ just turn it off for me?”

“A striking thought,” said Jake Jingles.

“I’m sorry,” she replied, making eye contact for the first time, eyebrows erect with no minimum of patronization. “I can’t do that, Barney, but I _can_ have something to eat brought up for you, if you’d like.”

“_…another roller in the night!_”

“Quite. And that was the idea, but it's also important to note - not to give too much away, I hope – that Rome's decline is inevitable, despite what hope we all love to swaddle ourselves in, and thus we might as well enjoy what we have so far achieved, yes?”

“Well, I'm glad you brought this chili with you... It _is_ quite an achievement,” said Jaime Jangles, having eaten half a trowel’s worth.

“How does that sound, huh…? It’s Chili Day!”

Barney Blimp gripped the handles straddling his bed-bound prison so ferociously that he soon blacked out.
