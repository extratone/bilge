Becoming a Compaq ASE establishes a partnership
between the ASE and Compaq. Upon accreditation as an ASE, the
Systems Engineer automatically begins receiving essential tools
and support, some of which are not available to System Engineers
who are not ASEs. Additionally, as a reward for the hard work
and efforts of becoming a Compaq ASE, Compaq provides many benefits
to these individuals such as discounts and incentives for training
and engineering events, product discounts, free subscriptions,
etc. Benefits provided as part of the Compaq ASE Program are geared
towards helping both the ASE as well as the employer. Following
is a description of some of the benefits provided as part of the
ASE Program.<br>

<a name="info"><H3>Information and Support Tools Valued in Excess of $1500 </H3></A>

<I>(Available to ASEs and Associate ASEs)<BR>
</I>The amount of information available to
Compaq ASEs and Associate ASEs is endless. All ASEs automatically
receive, at no charge, access to every technical tool and subscription
available from Compaq. This ensures that along with their training,
Compaq ASEs are equipped with the latest information, support
tools, and software to successfully plan, install, troubleshoot,
integrate and optimize Compaq solutions. Upon accreditation, ASEs
receive a Welcome Kit to help them understand and fully utilize
these resources from Compaq. After that, ASEs receive monthly
subscription mailings from Compaq to ensure they have the latest
information and tools available.<BR>
<P>
Once accredited, Compaq ASEs and Associate ASEs have toll-free
access to an exclusive Compaq ASE Forum.The
purpose of this forum is to enable ASEs to share information and
leverage the expertise of other Compaq ASEs from around the world.
Additionally, ASEs may dial into Compaq's
technical databases 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, free of charge.
ASEs also receive a quarterly
<I>ASE Newsletter</I> containing information about upcoming events
and the ASE Program.<BR>
<P>
<i>(Available to ASEs)<BR>
</I>Because of their extensive training on
Compaq hardware and operating system integration, Compaq ASEs
receive a free subscription to Compaq SmartStart -- the intelligent
CD-based process that integrates hardware configurations and software
installations into a single, streamlined process. Additionally,
ASEs are privileged to free, priority access to Compaq technical
support reducing hold times to a minimum.<br>

<a name="training"><H3>Training </H3></A>

<I>(Available to ASEs and Associate ASEs)<BR>
</I>To ensure that Compaq ASEs are properly
trained and maintain the expertise to perform as expected, periodic
training is provided as well as private, non-disclosure events
where ASEs can learn about upcoming Compaq products and technologies.
Annually, ASEs are invited to the Compaq Systems Engineering conference
where they attend break-outs and have a chance to speak directly
with the top experts at Compaq. Priority registration, discounts,
and incentives are provided to ASEs for most events.<br>
<a name="other"><H3>Other Benefits </H3></A>

<I>(Available to Associate ASEs and ASEs)<BR>

ASEs to gain them immediate recognition as a member of a worldwide
team of highly trained Compaq Systems Engineers. These materials
include use of the ASE logo for stationery and business cards,
ASE brochures, and ASE catalog items including clothing and business
accessories. <BR>
<BR>
