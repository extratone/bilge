Surely, we have arrived upon the final form of the social media brands I have grown up with. Over the summer, WordPress implemented [Twitter → WordPress thread unrolling](https://wordpress.com/blog/2020/07/15/unroll-your-twitter-threads-into-wordpress/), which I'm sure at least one user on Earth has used unironically/not accidentally, since. Given the outputs it's produced for me, I'm not quite sure I understand its purpose.

This morning, I was genuinely astonished to see [an article on _The Verge_'s homepage](https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/14/21515567/wordpress-tool-twitter-thread-tweetstorm-automated-social-post-preview) announcing the _vice versa_... **WordPress as Twitter client**.

It fucking works.

Given the drastic neutering to which Twitter has subjected its APIs in the past 5-10 years, I have absolutely no idea how or why they were convinced to okay this integration, but I'm sure a few spamming hobbyists out there will at least enjoy a _Day of Deluge_ between their spam WordPress blogs and their spam Twitter accounts. Godspeed, folks.
