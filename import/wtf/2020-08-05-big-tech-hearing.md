I spent _far_ too much of last Wednesday pacing in front of and screaming at my television. I did not intend to watch the entirety of the Zuckerberg-Bezos-Cook-Pichai hearing, but I basically did, and it wore me the fuck out. I thought I'd try to make some use of all that time, so here I am... posting. I only have a few things to say, and I've already said the majority of it on Twitter.

Firstly, I took the opportunity to get [one more test](https://www.loom.com/share/63e0049a3e194e81b5e54fa18e79f8c6) of Loom in and recorded myself using my least favorite piece of software in history to go over the [pre-published copy of his statement](https://blog.aboutamazon.com/policy/statement-by-jeff-bezos-to-the-u-s-house-committee-on-the-judiciary). You're welcome.

[Jeff Bezos' Statement (Edited)](https://www.davidblue.wtf/wp-content/uploads/Statement_by_Jeff_Bezos_to_the_U.S._House_Committee_on_the_Judiciary.docx)[Download](https://www.davidblue.wtf/wp-content/uploads/Statement_by_Jeff_Bezos_to_the_U.S._House_Committee_on_the_Judiciary.docx)

The spectacle of it all was bizarre in so many ways - the most original of these being the fact that it took place over _virtual conference software_, of course. To be honest, it was [really gross](https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/1288532875420336130). Jeff Bezos looked dead and vulnerable, Mark Zuckerberg looked like he was [locked in a shed](https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/1288533673319501831), Tim Cook looked _fucking ancient_, and Sundar Pichai appeared disturbingly and unwaveringly impeccable.

As in Zuckerberg's first solo televised hearing, two years ago, the Congresspeople made an absolute fool of themselves - especially the white ones.

A short documentary which I _demand_ all users of Facebook properties/the internet in general watch through.

One point of history that is continually glossed over (from my perspective) is that _we already did this_ 20 years ago, to Microsoft. As far as I could tell, nobody referenced the original Microsoft monopoly hearings at all throughout the entire event. Luckily, Big Ole Bill, himself, appears willing to discuss it, as he did in [a recent _Wired_ interview](https://www.wired.com/story/get-wired-podcast-4-bill-gates/).

> I got a whole committee attacking me and they had four at a time. I mean, Jesus Christ! What's the Congress coming to? If you wanna give a guy a hard time, give him at least a whole day that he has to sit there in the hot seat by himself. I mean, it was such a sweet thing... And they didn't even have to get on a plane!

Honestly, the rest of what I have to say has already been Tweeted. Here's **[the whole Moment](https://twitter.com/i/events/1291436270166724610?s=20)**.
