_A poem about alcohol originally published in_ Feebles in Night_._

Movement  
in bitter  
vibrations  
about  
weighted clique  
in the sooted  
pit

Selling whatever  
and approaching some place to be saved,  
surreal  
or left  
or dead  
but included

There's a love of  
the upset condition  
of leaving the bitterness in the bathroom

Fool me,  
but it's expensive  
seeking and gluttoning the  
spirit medicine  
The muse of a thousand obstructions  
frighten amassed  
pulled anatomy of cowards to  
the drudged rhythm

Open something unwanted for  
wilting wanters  
tonight

Take it  
and you'll thank everything  
give it all away
