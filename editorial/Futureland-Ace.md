I need a place to go
Where dreams are solid gold
Watch up in the sky
A shiny city bright

Hear it calling
See it coming
In the share of worlds to be
So can you feel it in the wind

Rising like a tide of energy?

And I believe
The night is over, let the light fall on me

▀▄▀▄▀▄   🎀  Ｆｕｔｕｒｅｌａｎｄ  🎀   ▄▀▄▀▄▀

All history
Is just a dream
A fire burning so high
