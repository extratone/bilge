We believe clipboard is important for mobile text editing. In Taio, you can capture clipboard quickly using shortcuts or widgets.

In the main app, press and hold an item to edit or launch an action.

Taio has a nice Markdown editor (CommonMark standard), with features like syntax highlighting, formatting toolbar, and Files support.

The editor also supports gestures like pinch to zoom, swipe to move cursor, and triple tap to select the current paragraph.

Local history? It's better to have difference compare, be confident about your changes.

We don't do everything for you. Instead, we add extensibility to the editor, and you can create your own automate workflows.

We are working on custom rendering templates. For now, Taio supports MathJax, Mermaid, Flowchart, Sequence Diagrams, and Highlightjs.

Taio has a full-fledged automation system, just like the Shortcuts app, but designed for text, and you can use it directly in the editor.

Other than chaining actions, action system supports defining variables, control flows, and even running JavaScript (powered by [@JSBoxApp](https://twitter.com/JSBoxApp)).
