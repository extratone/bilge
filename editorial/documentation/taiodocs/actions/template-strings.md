# Template Strings

Template strings are text that can be filled with dynamic data such as current date, clipboard text, or defined variables:

<img src="../actions/assets/IMG_4.png" width="360" />

Template strings are dynamically generated at runtime, as shown in the screenshot. In most cases, strings in action blocks are template strings.

## Multi-line Text

To use multiple lines of text within a template string, simply enter a newline character, no need to use `\n` to escape:

<img src="../actions/assets/IMG_5.png" width="360" />

## Text Snippets

Text snippets are also essentially template strings that can be dynamically inserted into the current edit area.
