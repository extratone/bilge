You know I'm Apple notes has always been a thing for me because of the texture in the background I really always hated that I'm so glad it's gone so I can actually use it now but it's just occurred to me I am looking at PJ Vogt a reply all his apology tweet is two screenshots of an Apple note to screenshot that aren't even square Think I need to times a lot of time on those words you're very deliberate what you said probably thought about it for dates ask people nowadays hours at least maybe not I don't know but then you can't use the guides the fucking crop the wonderful crop of shit iOS you can't like see that it's not square of what it's not just in such a serious case it's so worth it I realize the Apple notes will most certainly go down in history it will be a forever immortalized at the light by its role or by function in this role where I guess celebrities need to post some thing longform and I don't know who I wish I got I would love to go and investigate if you were the first person start doing this arm but I needed to put an apology on Twitter I had more and let you know the thing about being images that you can also post on Instagram or whatever and they're like oh Where can I go on my iPhone how can I do this I guess I could go in the notes and then I can screenshot of the statement that I have but there's got to be multiple screenshots from iMessage to tradition now I can't think of anyone else specifically but I can just use it anyways I'll be on more lies as the apology soft like him that's where the big famous public apology is not a thing and the reason I sale and more lies arm I'm sure I am almost father email at some of whatever textbooks are the future textbooks are will contain those images 50 years from now containers images or images of those images taken from Annapolis probably forget you know I am I don't think it hurts it's always best thing for me at like literally every single time there's someone took me in a post to public apology summer bus full of algae I go looking for it for that reason right when I have to come right up there is that one of them boy would I love to have a conversation later cause I'm sure the person here there I'm sure that Apple acquired what we can notify us today anyway there's a group smaller people that are keenly aware of their legacy temperature but I am up just this is how this is how do use apologies of your number maybe not even God it might influence art that fucking take face that he is very distant people will be I want to do an art about these apologies and she'll be like a hand drawn rendition of the cells and they won't have known where the notes came from but says I'm playing 100 years a 730 students going to be going through like apologies from the early 2020 for century wait how long will I will not exist and be continue to use this well I guess as long as I know in 10 years probably some girl why are all these apologies that the same it's not the textbook now these are actual artifacts original images from history why why are they all using what appears to be the same font and the same back background and I'll go digging and I'm sure they'll know that the iPhone wheel more lies is even more than it is now iOS will be and so they're going to find a list of apps that were on iPhone at the time and will start to ease her screenshots of those and I'll come across Maybe the official screenshots from the App Store of Apple notes so I hope someone else enjoys his knowledge Joyce's realization because I don't know if it's just it's special to this point Internet history you know I think I could do something artistic and Drafts my own apology for toot I'll drop your apology to Apple notes and make it a whirl thing is where I'm actually being a story of you are saying it was Apple it's fault talking as if I assaulted appetizers up there and then suggesting The texture thing as it ask you for it Kuchar God bless you Apple is
