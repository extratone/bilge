# Not much has changed
You know I am I was looking at the package and looking at the photo of the last oldest photo I have of me holding an iPhone I guess the one at the KFC picture from 2009 and then looking at taking pictures of the of the iPhone boxes like the only thing I have the iPhones the only good camera I have but I need to take a picture of it for the review so yeah I got to use some goddamn boxes the subject but anyway I'm in the box has gotten thinner wider and taller yes much though there are less things in the box there's my phone came with that big square is it a USB adapter they still remember plus the USB to the 30 pin connector plus the cleaning cart cloth plus a cute manual thing and a pair of earbuds but with the father Max is the Saul big fan and then that Cable with one end is the lightning in the other end is the new the newest knew you are universal cereal but I think the box still smells good oh yeah it's not appeal to fucking put screen protector off the guy and it is real and in our funds to us to do that to do the honors and I and my mom brought up my goddamn in boxing videos but it is part of history I must live with I really hope that I didn't lose my iPhone box in Portland and look for it
