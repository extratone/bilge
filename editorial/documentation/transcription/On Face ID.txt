# On Face ID
So on face ID specifically hi I'm looking at my iPhone A+ review right now 2 1/2 years ago I am and I guess you know what I guess this review really I said actually just ring something that I can't sit down and read my own shit anymore I am I was really better about the iPhone ex I just didn't like it I am very I was resistant to change I've been using the same shape of iPhone since 2007 since I was that we young man in the picture with the holding it on with KFC picture of him he only does require as a Nilay Patel noted one might regard the eight is the last compromise of basically four years of the same side since launch it's unsurprisingly stayed away that too far behind on the spreadsheets for most android type folks not that I've ever believed and truly in capable of comprehending what it means to package of product given where the greasy start up salt it up And then parentheses you cannot doubt me I want to be your long sabbatical from Iowa is for the Sony is free to play arm and my authority is absolutely the rest are trying to decide whether not to pay $200 more for "the phone at the future which knows when you're watching it and is only good for playing half an hour of stupid video games before it needs a charge yeah I am OK so face and he specifically I've only had this phone for a few days Jesus him to three days oh my God I get it oh my God for things like my password manager am in comparison to using a thumb holy hell yeah I guess I've been OK I've only use it in good light but then again when am I ever I mean your screen is bright yeah I can't I entire fleetly get it to and yeah I know that annotation which may or may not show up because apparently hypothesis but has been breaking my posts and I might turn it off but since being like the annotation thing that pops up I am on bills the world but a arm what I say go back oh it's pouring out that like yes I'm at I said I'd rather have experienced it in a big boy top line flag ship handset after 2 1/2 years of refinement I assume I assume their face ID is better now than it was then everything I said about face ID this review sound stupid entirely unnecessary at best I am yeah it's I can see it in this phone at least I'm in a in a very very a constrain conditions which I have used it being in my house lamps on screens I am god it's so much easier than using my thumb so much easier and you know him well while I'm on that topic I guess maybe I should put the clip

The mask thing is a problem... I’ve had the immense privilege of *not* having to wear a mask for an entire workday (honestly not sure how I would manage it considering that my glasses immediately fog up completely when I have worn a mask,) but I played around with setting up Face ID’s “alternate appearance” option, which seems like it would do the trick. It would be nice if one could set up multiple alternate appearances - I needed to use my single slot for my appearance when wearing my Bose Soundlink headphones. I’m genuinely curious if you’ve found success with it.
