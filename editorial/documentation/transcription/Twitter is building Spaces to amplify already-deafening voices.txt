# Twitter is building Spaces to amplify already-deafening voices
The first for the space I stumbled upon was hosted by Matt Daniels who I'm assuming that I discovered on periscope because he was quite prolific there and he said something profound about Twitter spaces when I asked how do you know how his foot are going to prevent poor space is going away a Periscope which regardless of any of the actual use implications as a business it has failed him and elected butter and he said the big difference between spaces in Periscope is the lack of text chat and he said that his experience on periscope was that it was a text chat and people in the text chat saying shit That was the downfall of periscope and so the crucial exclusion the answer feature of Twitter spaces is the lack of texture now I also join space most recently that had a bunch of young cool people in it that's what are celebrities were just popular younger Twitter users he was certain it was around a K-pop band but no I'm sorry not care about the CPAP and they just released an album they were talking about anyway And they were like these they said a lot of things I recorded that were interesting about spaces and when they did come up was you know I really wish it was text chat here's the big problem that I that I've got to surface for you a lot of people on the Internet how many people the amount of people that I know on the Internet who are uncomfortable coming in voice chat but have lots of valuable things to say texture is a mess now I think that like we've vaguely lamented the "anonymity the Internet allows because yes it has Well arguably enabled trolls to say awful shit etc. but the original promise the Internet with the people who were uncomfortable being identified by name could have control over their identity and that control I think I can say without question has a Lotta Lotta voices that we wouldn't have otherwise heard to speak for a quote Thanks for text I know this I know that there are a lot of people are important people who are uncomfortable coming in voice chat because I ran a podcast that you might say it was about Internet culture for a year dry cast back in 2015 and I mean a lot of the people that I wanted to speak to you just didn't want their voices to be revealed it might be a question of an identity might not be A lot of people I know on Twitter are trans and well just like that we were actually there is no merit and deconstructing whether or not someone is justified in being uncomfortable but if we were I think that's a pretty good argument right and Twitter spaces apparently not original space with Matt Mike Elgin was also in there and I I can't directly quiet so I'm actually not sure who it was but someone say that they've been in space recently with water developers who had specifically explicitly said yes Twitter spaces was designed Without text chat so that people felt safe there and I can understand that but I would comment I did just the one that's going to like it's going to end up to the spaces with the same people who already have an audience and already have therefore access to many ways of engaging with their audience It's it's it's just for them it's for the people who are totally cool with sharing with people people who is giving them tools to moderate and like I'm not this is expected right this is a rational business decision by sweater but that's all it is and I've been running about this and in the course of it in or going and looking at Twitter is about page which has a big head that says we serve the public conversation and I was like it first ha ha well but then they do the issue is how you define public conversation I think Twitter originally Na√Øvely perhaps if anyone who you are defined the public conversation as serving it the betterment of it would involve is this thing as a platform for those who wouldn't otherwise be heard from her but now the public conversation I think it's for us to find it is referring to what's happening and what's happening suggests a lot of people like what's what's on the lines of of of a lot of people together not you know what are some original thoughts that someone might have that that wouldn't otherwise be heard and the problem one last thing the issue was going down that avenue of arguing that Business decisions like that on social networks punish the minority is that a lot of people with very foul views feel like they dominate minority and the truth of keeping them from from being violent to people while they ultimately basically that is silencing them know that's and it was just makes them feel like they're in the minority more but personally the person that people really suffer here are the people who do you have edgy that exactly is it that you have genuinely original things to say that aren't hateful because that's just a very small portion of anything and it's not a result it's not original to be edgy but yeah I'm writing about it I would I would like to hear from anyone Who is not good for being heard from a voice what your thoughts might be on this oh yeah I guess the last thing I'll say I am expecting Twitter to genuinely seek out and uplift silence voices is something that I have I've not been burned with the expectation of Twitter Inc. doing anything positive for years so I guess it's a privilege Twitter spaces
