# "Undercovered"

## Define: UNDERCOVERED

<u>Adjective</u>

*(Of an individual, project, social dynamic, single event, etc.)*

**Less present in popular discourse than is contextually appropriate.**

When I use the term "undercovered," I am describing something which "mainstream media" (*technology journalism*, most often) has not, is not, and/or is not likely to adequately amplify according to my own framework of relevance.

#### Some prime examples:

* [**Bandcamp as the answer to all contemporary woes regarding music streaming services**](https://bilge.world/bandcamp-streaming-music).
* [Mastodon as the answer to (a great many) contemporary woes regarding social networks](https://bilge.world/eugen-rochko-interview).
* [Discord as a superior (and free!) Slack alternative for small businesses/projects](https://bilge.world/discord-slack-comparison).
