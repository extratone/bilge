# "short 'n' dirty" Bandcamp Metadata

The social network Periscope is going to officially be dead in precisely one week, so I thought I might share what I would estimate to be the [absolute best example](https://www.pscp.tv/AsphaltApostle/1djxXAjewOLKZ) of my hundreds of improvised broadcasts over the ~6 years we had with it.

Unfortunately, the original audio was recorded with an iPhone 6 Plus' microphone at a sub-optimal distance from my Yamaha digital keyboard before being *further* compressed to stream live on Periscope, and *then likely compressed further still* when I redownloaded it  recently.

> Hello, I was wondering what sort of text formatting is supported in Bandcamp's metadata fields (ex: "about this track",) if any. I'm particularly wondering if it's possible to use italics and hyperlinks.
