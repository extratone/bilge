## The Open Web Is Living and Lovely

### A not altogether-cohesive review of July reads and research.

**In case you're similarly long overdue for a reminder that beautiful things are still being made on the internet...**

After nearly a year of relative sobriety from my old, once-severe addiction to Web Site hunting, it occurred to me just yesterday that some explicit wandering as I once did for days at a time - through the clever, innovative, and uniquely tasteful projects through which an astonishingly-original few give their whole thinking \(and often physical\) selves in obscurity despite how little financial \(and often professional\) incentive is maintained by those who unknowingly need it the most - might be the best feasible remedy to my current, most perplexing state of faithlessness and bafflement toward the ambitions of trades and cultures I feel I once so thoroughly understood. A great portion of you are surely undergoing your own manifestations of the same hopelessness - I cannot _ever_ remember a time in my life when global events were so _utterly_ discouraging so relentlessly.

### Design and The Open Web

In this present when every element of American reality is so much more incessantly ugly than we could’ve ever imagined, let’s take at least a momentary respite to look at some visually irresistible and/or _super sick_ Sites on the truly-resolute Open Web to assure our existential selves that _yes, beauty shall not cease to exist_. For better or worse, my \#1 goto source to find innovative, delicious web design has always been _Typewolf_, who [announced last fall](https://www.typewolf.com/blog/goodbye-to-favorite-sites-posts) that he will not be continuing his “Site of the Month” section, though his relentless “[Site of the Day](https://www.typewolf.com/site-of-the-day)” roll will continue, unhindered.

Those of us for whom the Podcast medium became a trusted and relatively regular one in our lives long before anyone figured out how to make a real business out of it - certainly [_eons_](https://www.macworld.com/article/1048271/podcastword.html) preceeding the original startup podcast-only \(apparently [HBO-like](https://www.niemanlab.org/2015/07/gimlet-wants-to-become-the-hbo-of-podcasting-heres-what-its-founders-learned-trying-to-get-there/) publication - [Gimlet Media](https://observer.com/2015/02/gimlet-media/) - to be successfully launched. Now, though, your mom - perhaps even _her_ mom - listens to podcasts, and what was once a The single Missouri alumni at _The Verge_, Ashley Carmen, [**explored the proliferation of podcasting**](https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/19/20699360/podcasts-business-advertising-revenue-serial-apple-spotify-big-picture) and the process by which it became profitable.

Whilst trying out [Garageband for iOS’](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/garageband/id408709785) new sample packs, I sampled the [accompanying video](https://youtu.be/DvisTHAvaIE) to the article and produced [the best “track” I’ve ever made with the app](https://soundcloud.com/chordoslut/everyone-has-a-podcast-none-but-god-are-listening/s-ICt6x) \(for whatever that’s worth.\)

_Speaking of_ Gimlet Media: [the latest episode](https://gimletmedia.com/shows/reply-all/xjhx3l/146-summer-hotline) of my longtime favorite of their podcasts, _Reply All_, is a sort of condensed remake of [my favorite podcast episode of all time](https://gimletmedia.com/shows/reply-all/llhezj) \(of any show, not just this one\) in which hosts [Alex Goldman](https://twitter.com/AGoldmund) and [P.J. Vogt](https://twitter.com/PJVogt)maintained an open telephone line for 48 hours and spoke with a whole bunch of people \(mostly Americans\) about... whatever. The result was beautifully _human_, if you’ll forgive my use of the cliche. I tend to revisit it when I’m feeling particularly isolated from and/or confused about the general ambitions of the people around me. I’ll be honest: I didn’t pay much attention to my first listen through the new episode, but I can tell you that it is worth your time, at least.

I was distraught when Spotify bought both the aforementioned Gimlet Media _and_ [the social audio turned podcasting app Anchor](https://medium.com/anchor/anchor-is-joining-spotify-70356e3ac23f) - both of which I \(rather ridiculously\) felt a special personal ownership over. \(The latter, especially, because they reached out to me early on to feature [_Extratone_’s channel](http://anchor.fm/extratone) on their music section.\) However, it appears that both are being treated fairly well in the 18+ months since their acquisition - probably because [they’ve been making Spotify money](https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/31/20748337/spotify-earnings-q2-2019-podcasting-growth-users-subscribers).
