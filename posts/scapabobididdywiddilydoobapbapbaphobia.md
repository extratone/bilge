# Scapabobididdywiddilydoobapbapbaphobia

clever in sharp
through it all
my holy communion
my reference tradition
now sometimes witnessed
and lamented
if only all these had been told
*shut out! shut up! 
just listen*

my companion met me two nights in a row in front of the Heidelberg and said twice
*she loves me*
and of course it's like me to begin to read in but
*when nobody else does, she loves me*
I don't quite note his particular personification 

more impressively trained, definitively
with a stack of charts - some his - on his noggin
but when he'd finally play, I'd pity
because he must ask first
and his fingers are well-read
but *they* must ask first
and every little passerby
draws away his eye
so delicate,
his attention for she that loves him
