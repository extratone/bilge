# A Thoroughfare

is it in-between,
where I am?



nowhere at all?



is it blessed,
where I am?



ragged, thoroughly chaste?



do you think it's beautiful?
I can't decide.



can it be truthful,
if all manner of friend insist
that it's hiding?



I am Here, at least.
*speaks and walks*


Present,
for the time being.
