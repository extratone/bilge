# Americana Trauma

see what we have asked of this land:
juicing zea jabbing through
chapped flats

see what we have asked of her soldiers:
contentment,
submerged alone in nuggets of petrified human safetyglass

shower of obliterated abstracts;
white like love,
but no shards large enough to make out a face
