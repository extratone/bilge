# Music

I'm not an authority on electronic music, but I am surrounded by musician friends of a particular creativity and I am the creator of an electronic music magazine called [_Extratone_](https://extratone.com). I also curate the music podcast [_Extratone Radio_](http://extratone.com/radio). For tastemaking's sake, I maintain a public [Bandcamp Collection](https://bandcamp.com/davidblue) and a playlist on Apple Music called [_**Islands**_](https://music.apple.com/us/playlist/islands/pl.u-oZyljWRspbBNgA) of the most astonishing and unique electronic tracks I come across. There's also [_**C̸ ̵O̷ ̴N̵ ̶T̸ ̵A̵ ̴C̶ ̵T̴**_](https://soundcloud.com/chordoslut/sets/c-o-n-t-a-c-t), which is filled with tracks cross-genre that are _guaranteed_ to touch you.

 ---[Four by David Blue](http://davidblue.bandcamp.com/album/four)

I've intermittently recorded [piano improvs](https://davidblue.bandcamp.com/) under my own name \(though I haven't properly in a good while.\) On [_Four_](https://davidblue.bandcamp.com/album/four), my most recent improv tape, I used two knockoff SM57s placed directly above my sleepy childhood upright piano at my mom's house through a USB mixer and [livestreamed most of the recording](https://youtu.be/p3KoQ6n0xKo). The result is a fairly good representation of what I was doing musically at the time and probably the most dynamically interesting of all the recordings I've captured. The instrument itself has a very particular dreamy quality that I've never heard on any other.
