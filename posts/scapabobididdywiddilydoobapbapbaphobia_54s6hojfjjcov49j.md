## Scapabobididdywiddilydoobapbapbaphobia

clever in sharp through it all my holy communion my reference tradition now sometimes witnessed and lamented if only all these had been told _shut out! shut up! just listen_

my companion met me two nights in a row in front of the Heidelberg and said twice _she loves me_ and of course it's like me to begin to read in but _when nobody else does, she loves me_ I don't quite note his particular personification

more impressively trained, definitively with a stack of charts - some his - on his noggin but when he'd finally play, I'd pity because he must ask first and his fingers are well-read but _they_ must ask first and every little passerby draws away his eye so delicate, his attention for she that loves him
