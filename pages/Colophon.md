## *The Psalms* is proudly hosted by [Write.as](http://write.as/about) - a new sort of blogging content management system built atop [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) and maintained by a company which [explicitly shares](https://write.as/principles) my commitment to a better, Open web.

**I truly, deeply love my host CMS/service and do not pay enough for it. Can you say the same?** Use my [invite link](https://write.as/join/4bqc8482) and give Write.as/WriteFreely a try. It [literally saved my life](https://write.as/community/chat-with-david-blue).

A somewhat-outdated version of this site's theme is [listed among others](https://write.as/themes/bilge) in Writeas' official themes list. The full, up-to-date CSS and JS can be found below and on in [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/extratone/bilge), which I created in November, 2020 as an experiment in using Git to track editorial changes. (*That means you can see [current in-progress drafts](https://github.com/extratone/bilge/tree/main/Drafts)!*)

### Drafts Theme

If you happen to be a user of agiletortoise’s infamous [Drafts app](https://getdrafts.com) on iOS and/or MacOS, I have just released [**a quite-uncanny theme**](https://actions.getdrafts.com/t/1km) on the new Themes Directory emulating _The Psalms_’ reading experience which I am quite pleased with.
