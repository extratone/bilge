"Experimental, topical shorts on media, hardware, and software" sounds a lot like what I've [already got going on](https://bilge.world), I know, but why not have another go at something more casual and see if it means me contributing with any sort of frequency or regularity.

Who's up for speccing the fuckin' tag system I'm going to need for this?

I can't believe I've missed commenting this all this time... The Mapaper map images, especially, are too beautiful to miss!

## The Psalms' New Telegram Channel

I've created [**yet another Telegram channel**](https://t.me/neoyokel) that I'm going to attempt to use to share related media/documentation/minutia as I have been here but in a slightly different format. I thought I would try it because 1.) I want to take more advantage of Telegram, generally and 2.) I should avoid using GitHub as a file sharing service, and using Telegram as a substitution when particular challenges become an issue might actually stick.

...and here I was, thinking my longform idea might actually seem original in 2021. Marques is very good at what he does, if you couldn't tell already.

* Pocket Casts on the *Windows Desktop*... Here's the [actual, official Windows Store link](https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9PCDBQX582BZ). Seems oxymoronic in no insignificant degree.
