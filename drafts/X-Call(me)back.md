# X-Call(me)back

## Lamenting a needless (and very inconvenient) deprecation.

<!--more-->

A few weeks ago, I used the [support contact form](https://ulysses.app/contact "Ulysses Support Contact Form") for the popular iOS/iPadOS/macOS app Ulysses to send the following message:

> Howdy folks!
> I've been looking into using Ulysses' URL Scheme and have not been able to find a *current* document on help.ulysses.app. I found the old page [on the Web Archive](http://web.archive.org/web/20160314104529/http://ulyssesapp.com:80/kb/x-callback-url "Ulysses X-Callback-URL Documentation (Archived)") - which is certainly enough for me as long as its information is still current - but I suppose I was wondering why it seems to have been unpublished?

The very prompt [response](https://app.sparkmailapp.com/web-share/EWr1BnP9WN29W3hhFQ5-Ceadu6YWfA_Rf3Or3oLr "Re: X-Callback-URL Support in Ulysses"):

> Hi David,
> Thanks for your message. 
> We have deprecated support for X-Callback URLs, since most actions should be available via Shortcuts. However, X-Callback still works in Ulysses. You can find the documentation for X-Callback in Ulysses in [the attached zip file](https://www.icloud.com/iclouddrive/0ed4T2Hs_z0GfexdbWG6fW5hg#UlyssesX-Callback-URL "Ulysses X-Callback-URL Support Zip File (iCloud Drive)").
> May I ask why you are using X-Callback instead of Shortcuts? Are you missing any features?
> Thanks,  
> GÃ¶tz Fabian  
> Developer

Unfortunately, I have yet to respond, but hopefully this finished post will provide a comprehensive answer, Gourd willing. Perhaps it 'twas a bit uncouth, but instead, I immediately published the entirety of what was sent as [a GitHub Repository](https://github.com/softwarehistorysociety/UlyssesX-Callback-URL "Ulysses X-Callback-URL Documentation GitHub Repository"). As far as I can tell - though its creators may consider Ulysses' X-callback-url support *deprecated* - all of its (quite unique!) actions continue to function.

## Context

Though I now ruefully describe myself as an *iPhone Poweruser*, I have also spent the past several years realizing the severity of my lack of knowledge regarding *automation* on iPhone and iPad, specifically. An ongoing subscription to [*Club MacStories*](https://club.macstories.net/ "Club MacStories") has certainly contributed to this, throughout a period of [general newfound detail-oriented life](https://bilge.world/2021 "The Psalms' 2021").
