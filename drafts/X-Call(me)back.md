## Lamenting a needless (and very inconvenient) deprecation.

<!--more-->

A few weeks ago, I used the [support contact form](https://ulysses.app/contact "Ulysses Support Contact Form") for the popular iOS/iPadOS/macOS app Ulysses to send the following message:

> Howdy folks!
> I've been looking into using Ulysses' URL Scheme and have not been able to find a *current* document on help.ulysses.app. I found the old page [on the Web Archive](http://web.archive.org/web/20160314104529/http://ulyssesapp.com:80/kb/x-callback-url "Ulysses X-Callback-URL Documentation (Archived)") - which is certainly enough for me as long as its information is still current - but I suppose I was wondering why it seems to have been unpublished?

The very prompt [response](https://app.sparkmailapp.com/web-share/EWr1BnP9WN29W3hhFQ5-Ceadu6YWfA_Rf3Or3oLr):

> Hi David,
> Thanks for your message. 
> We have deprecated support for X-Callback URLs, since most actions should be available via Shortcuts. However, X-Callback still works in Ulysses. You can find the documentation for X-Callback in Ulysses in the attached zip file.
> May I ask why you are using X-Callback instead of Shortcuts? Are you missing any features?
> Thanks,  
> GÃ¶tz Fabian  
> Developer
