## The most magical configurables I've ever created for iOS by a long way.

Though I don't believe I've ever discussed it, here, the continuance of the fandom for Houston music legend, DJ Screw, on into the 21st century is an issue I remain very invested in. I doubt you want to hear much about it, but the issue of actually *obtaining audio files* from the Screw collection is a worthwhile one to engage for context's sake. I was first introduced to the ~343-chapter collection by my high school best friend, who'd acquired it via an ancient Pirate Bay torrent some hero set up in the early 2000s[^1]. It was complete - probably - and more or less correctly organized *by chapter*, but that's about it as far as reliable metadata was concerned. The results one would find elsewhere on the web, from [sites like DatPiff](https://www.datpiff.com/mixtapes-search.php?criteria=keyword:dj+screw), were hardly any better - many, in fact, were obviously sourced from that same torrent.

[1] I attempted to find this torrent for the sake of this post and well... The Pirate Bay looks a lot different than I remembered.
