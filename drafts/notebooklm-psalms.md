I vividly remember daydreaming, as a young man, about what I thought of, then, as the potential for artifically intellligent entities. On a few occasions, I mentioned on early [*Drycast*](https://pods.link/drycast) how excited I was to ask said hypothetical machines *what they wanted* most of all. What I absolutely did not anticipate:

- That we would be [convinced enough](https://www.thisamericanlife.org/803/greetings-people-of-earth/act-one-17) by something as antithetical to what I was calling *Artificial Intelligence* (think [Commander Data](https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Data)) as Large Language Models to ascribe such a loaded moniker to them.
- That chatbots (what I was calling the forebearers of LLMs at the time) would end up so utterly [*humorless*](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.04563).
