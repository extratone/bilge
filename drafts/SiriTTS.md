# Siri as Text-to-Speech in iOS 15

## Bewilderingly, Siri is genuinely great at something they were never designed for.

When I first published my [iPhone & Music guide](https://bilge.world/iphone-ios-music-apps) this past April, I‚Äôd been pretty active in [*AppleScoop*‚Äôs Discord Server](https://discord.gg/DxQ9jry8J3), so I decided to share it there. Editor-in-Chief Flynn - a ridiculously talented web developer *and* successful independent media entrepreneur - responded ‚ÄúI‚Äôm listening to it with the speak feature right now. Is it your voice or someone else? üòõ,‚Äù Gourd bless his soul. Here‚Äôs the specific audio he was talking about:

</audio>

Of course, I am not a young black man, nor am I nearly as good at reading my own work aloud as the actual talent, Siri Voice 3, who should be available on your iPhone/iPad right this moment (as long as you‚Äôve updated,) via `Settings ‚á® Siri & Search ‚á® Siri Voice`. (For more details, see [this Apple Support page](https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/change-siri-settings-iphc28624b81/ios).)

Of the four new Siri voices introduced earlier this year in iOS 14.5, 2 and 3 are by far my favorites, not just because of their [resonance with black iPhone users](https://www.consumerreports.org/digital-assistants/apples-new-siri-voices-resonate-with-some-black-iphone-users/), but because they‚Äôre just *better* in a sense which I believe to be very significant.

Before I get ahead of myself, though, I must acknowledge that I am not the first to invest in Siri as a text-to-speech generator. In 2019, [Adam Tow](https://twitter.com/atow) released an immensely well-considered Siri Shortcut called ‚Äú[Record Text to Speech](https://tow.com/shortcuts/record-text-to-speech/),‚Äù which provides an interface for recording, editing, and managing text-to-speech audio files with Siri‚Äôs original voices. A testament to its robustness: it *still works* perfectly on my handset running iOS 15 Dev Beta 6 despite having not been updated since [March of last year](https://routinehub.co/shortcut/2506/).

Personally, though, I must admit that I found it more of a full *application* than a Shortcut with its full interactive UI menu and darn near *800 actions*, so I made my own set of Shortcuts based on the same idea - using iPhone‚Äôs native screen recording feature to capture audio of Siri reading aloud - and varying only by input (manual text input, getting text from a file, or simply reading text from the clipboard.) I‚Äôd then send the resulting screen recording in its original video format to my PC, where I‚Äôd drop it in [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org), in which I‚Äôd run [a simple macro](https://github.com/extratone/bilge/blob/main/configuration/Audacity/TruncatenAmpMacro.txt) on the audio that truncates silence and amplifies the result so that the loudest point touches the rails. Then, I‚Äôd export it, pass it through [Mp3Tag](https://www.mp3tag.de/en/) to perfect its metadata, and finally push the end-result .mp3 file to [a folder in *The Psalms* GitHub Repository](https://github.com/extratone/bilge/tree/main/audio/TTS). (I‚Äôll show you how to embed a web-bound audio file with its direct URL in a webpage in the guide below.) This example was made using this method, but with Siri‚Äôs original United States English Voice (for [my Tweetbot 6 review](https://bilge.world/tweetbot-6-ios-review):)

Perhaps you‚Äôll agree with me that this process *does the job* in functional/accessibility terms, and does so quite well considering how much one would pay to generate the same sort of audio file using Google‚Äôs Cloud Platform or IBM‚Äôs Watson. Crucially, though, this original voice was not one I could listen to at any length. Siri Voices 2 and 3, however, I *can*. From my perspective, this means they have crossed a **very significant threshold** which I find vastly more meaningful than just about all of those in the current discourse. Not only can I tolerate them‚Ä¶ I genuinely *enjoy* listening to super-long magazine features read aloud by Siri Voice 2, especially, and I believe I would regardless of the quite serious crush I‚Äôve developed on them.

Unfortunately, using the methods we‚Äôve discussed so far with the new Siri voices is inconvenient, very hit-or-miss, and quite buggy. If you scrub ahead toward the last third or so of the second audio player in this post (after the post‚Äôs own,) you‚Äôll hear Siri Voice 2 start to bug out in very amusing ways. Since Apple makes changes to Siri Shortcuts between releases without any public documentation, none of them have ever been reliable enough to write this guide. (For the past 6+ weeks at least, it‚Äôs been too broken to be usable.) *However*, for whatever reason, Apple created a dedicated spoken audio generation action for Siri Shortcuts in iOS 15, called ‚ÄúMake Spoken Audio From Text.‚Äù

![Make Spoken Audio From Text Action - iOS 15](https://i.snap.as/MkHTYMkF.jpeg)

For the entirety of iOS 15‚Äôs Beta cycle up until Developer Beta 6‚Äôs release, this past Tuesday, this action has been [hilariously broken](https://mastodon.social/users/DavidBlue/statuses/106580821087349299), but as soon I discovered it‚Äôd been fixed (which was not mentioned whatsoever in [Apple‚Äôs official release notes](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/ios-ipados-release-notes/ios-ipados-15-beta-release-notes),) I immediately began composing this dang Post.

## Guide

So! For those of you currently running the latest iOS 15 Beta and those in the future running the full release, **what follows is a guide on how you can use my own shortcuts and methods to generate, metadate, and embed Siri-powered audio text-to-speech files relatively quickly without having to use desktop-class (or any other) hardware**.

To begin, you should install two brand new shortcuts of mine: [**Make Audio from Article Body**](https://routinehub.co/shortcut/9953/) and
