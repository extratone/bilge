# Circling Back to Tweetbot 6.3

Yesterday morning, after finally taking the taking the time to explore the modernizations shipped with TweetBot 6.2, [last week](https://9to5mac.com/2021/08/17/tweetbot-6-2-update-timeline-widgets-multiple-windows-support-ipad), it occurred to me that it might be an ideal time to follow up on a brief exchange I‚Äôd had with Tapbots support in mid-February concerning a single, single key Bluetooth keyboard shortcut, ultimately - using the F key to favorite (and now `Shift + ‚åò + L` to ‚Äúlike‚Äù) which then seemed to have been lost in the transition from Tweetbot 5 to Tweetbot 6. If you‚Äôll recall from [my first stupidly time-consuming big Post of 2021](https://bilge.world/tweetbot-6-ios-review), our conversation was left open ended with ‚ÄúThanks, we‚Äôll take a look at these.‚Äù You might also recall a very specific pledge of mine which I just rediscovered:

> Without being verbose, I‚Äôll just tell you that if a near future update to the app fixes the `F` and `‚åò + R` shortcuts, I ùí≤‚Ñê‚Ñí‚Ñí shit out my whole ass.

The amount I‚Äôd learned about iPhone History and its operating system‚Äôs coinciding development in the interim felt absolutely ginormous‚Ä¶ So frighteningly great was it to behold, that I actually included a lame suggestion in my reply, that it might have *something* to do with Objective C vs. SwiftUI (god y‚Äôall are so cliquey though,) in what I also decided would be the last time I bothered them about it.

Just *twenty-one* minutes later:

Naturally‚Ä¶ They were 100% correct‚Ä¶ I just somehow managed to skip the crucial step of actually *trying the shortcuts in the app* before reaching out. Very likely the least competent behavior possible from *The iPhone Hardware Keyboard Guy*, yeah? 

Anyway, though their spare release notes don‚Äôt mention it, the Tapbots guys obviously hooked a keyboard up to an iPhone recently.
