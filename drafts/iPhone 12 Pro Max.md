"This *really is* my last iPhone."

This is the last sentence of [my very sentimental iPhone 8 Plus review](https://bilge.world/iphone-8-plus-review) from May, 2018, in which I bemoaned Apple's decision to finally retire the basic hardware configuration which had defined the marque's first ten years, citing my "loyalty." 

In the past few weeks, I have come to realize that the device which I now hold in my hands - which I *cling to*, in fact, at all hours and completely without reason - is the absolute manifestation of everything my 14-year-old, first generation iPhone-adopting self could have possibly dreamt of in its future.

it is a guarantee that no matter where I may go or who I may find myself unwittingly surrounded by, the option to escape into my own Computing World *in its entirety* and more - not just an abbreviated, **Mobile** facsimile - shall from now on and forever be with me, there against my right asscheek, just a grab and a glance away. Like The Holy Spirit was it pledged and prepared to stay by my side.

Ya know, I'm actually astonished by how much of this ritual *hasn't* changed.

- [ ] As always with new phone reviews, I am presented with a dilemma: the device, itself is by far the best camera I own. (Technically, my only other imaging device is my [Nikon COOLPIX 990](https://www.flickr.com/gp/davidblue/V861Vx), which has long since eaten up every last AA battery I had.) I must use the device, itself to take any images of the device.
