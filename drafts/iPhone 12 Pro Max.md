## I lied.

"This *really is* my last iPhone."

This is the last sentence of [my very sentimental iPhone 8 Plus review](https://bilge.world/iphone-8-plus-review) from May, 2018, in which I bemoaned Apple's decision to finally retire the basic hardware configuration which had defined the marque's first ten years, citing my "loyalty."

- [ ] As always with new phone reviews, I am presented with a dilemma: the device, itself is by far the best camera I own. (Technically, my only other imaging device is my [Nikon COOLPIX 990](https://www.flickr.com/gp/davidblue/V861Vx), which has long since eaten up every last AA battery I had.) I must use the device, itself to take any images of the device.
