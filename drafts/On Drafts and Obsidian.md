## Native As Fuck might be out of style, but who can afford redundancy? Not I.

Undoubtedly, the most creatively productive person in my family is my brother-in-law, [Carlos Gabriel Ruiz](https://twitter.com/los_gabriel), who somehow manages to take care of a houseold, raise a preteen son, work a full-time iOS dev job of the most tedious, high-grade sort, *and* churn out [visual and written work](https://www.carlosgabrielruiz.com) on a regular basis. Have *you* ever seen quite so many vertical bars in a personal site title? I don’t think *I* have, and I know they’re legitimate. Something he told me last year has been on my mind nearly every day, since: his preferred word processor is Ye Olde FinalDraft, in which he still uses the same templates he configured in college. (That was quite a while ago.) I’ve thought about it just about every day, since, as I’ve spent an inquantifiable amount of time Just Fucking Around with my “workflow,” and reading other professional accounts of Just Fucking Around with workflows[^1] these past eighteen months. Do I spend more time configuring my writing spaces than *actually writing* because I have nothing to say? (I’m going to be interspersing embedded screenshots throughout this post that may or may not have something to do with the nearby contents. Sorry, I just captured far too many.)

I tried Obsidian. In fact - and I'm still not one hundred percent positive about this - I'm pretty sure I first tried Obsidian several years ago, though the Obsidian.md domain only stretches back to [April of 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200410075559/https://obsidian.md/), so I might just be nuts. Regardless, something said by *MacStories* founder and Definitive iPad Professional, Federico Viticci, in an issue of *MacStories Weekly* from late Summer really... jutted out:

> At its core, Obsidian is a Markdown text editor. Just point the app to a folder on your iPhone or iPad and you're ready to get started. The app is based on web technologies, which means it is highly customizable. Obsidian supports a theming system, with a wide variety of themes provided by the app's vibrant community of users and plugins to extend the app's functionality. The app's primary views are its editor and preview mode, which can be split into multiple panes both vertically and horizontally. Obsidian also supports saved workspaces that allow users to open a predefined group of notes easily, commands for quickly opening documents and accessing the app's features, along with extensive, customizable keyboard shortcut support. Of course, notes can be linked internally, allowing for the creation of a wiki-like web of documents.

In the interim, I've reviewed these few sentences over and over again, trying to find the discrepancy, but basically the core of my issue is that **Federico is describing *Drafts* as I know it, word for word**. In fact, since you're here, bear with me just a second as I misquote him, replacing the word "Obsidian" with "Drafts:"

> At its core, Drafts is a Markdown text editor. Just point the app to a folder on your iPhone or iPad and you're ready to get started. ~~The app is based on web technologies~~, which means it is highly customizable. Drafts supports a theming system, with a wide variety of themes provided by the app's vibrant community of users and plugins to extend the app's functionality.

Now, there are several points I probably wouldn't *start out with* when describing Drafts, but not one of these statements is wholly untrue, either. While you absolutely can "point [Drafts] to a folder on your iPhone or iPad" and be ready to "get started," [Folder Bookmarks](https://docs.getdrafts.com/docs/settings/bookmarks) *are* a fairly recent feature for Drafts, and not exactly configured *out of the box*. It is not - nor will it ever be - local filesystem-based like Obsidian, but honestly - especially as an iCloud+ subscriber with 2TB of iCloud Storage - I'm not sure this should be left as a detriment. Though I use a Git-enabled system to track revisions (which [I basically learned from Federico](https://www.macstories.net/ios/my-markdown-writing-and-collaboration-workflow-powered-by-working-copy-3-6-icloud-drive-and-github/)!,) I've honestly had much more success configuring bookmark-enabled file actions tied to specific folders and keyboard shortcuts than I did running off the filesystem with Obsidian for the few months-long period I gave it a shot, last year.[^2] More on that in a bit.

## Community

I’m also not entirely sure I’d feel honest describing [the Drafts community](https://forums.getdrafts.com) as it stands as “vibrant.” We’re more like... “bitchy or extremely helpful,” but such a transition seems to be inevitable in the lifecycle of any given text editor/word processor. There is still a single man, [whittling away on nano](https://news.itsfoss.com/gnu-nano-6-0-released/), and [Bear’s Subreddit](https://reddit.com/r/bearapp) may very well be the bitchiest spot on the bitchiest site on the bitchiest net in history. My [pitch to Greg Pierce](https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/1494040559161421827) for the creation of a Drafts-specific Discord or Telegram channel has apparently fallen flat, perhaps for the better. The Drafts Forums have their own vibrancy, and it’s in a few key folks - like Stephen Millard, for instance, and Greg, himself - who will jump in within a matter of minutes or hours to address even the most facepalmy questions. (Describing many of my own.)

Not just in support, but in requests. I think [my inquiry into the possibility of native Mastodon posting support](https://forums.getdrafts.com/t/posting-to-mastodon-from-drafts-native-action-service/12089) offers a profound example. Within a matter of hours, Greg responded with [an actual, working Post to Mastodon action](https://directory.getdrafts.com/a/1v8) and another pro-dev user joined the conversation with an account of their recent attempts to modify Greg’s own [Tweet Storm action](https://actions.getdrafts.com/a/1Hu) for Mastodon. Notably, 1.) this was a *Sunday morning* and 2.) this was [not the first request of mine](https://twitter.com/draftsapp/status/1492645727729766400) which Greg had fulfilled almost immediately upon prompt *just that weekend*. Then, there’s the innumerable email threads between Greg and I discussing - what else - [keyboard shortcuts support on iPhone](https://uikeycommand.com).

I distinctly remember one such thread that resolved a ridiculous and mild panic I’d been set in when I accidentally disabled Background App Refresh for Drafts, which caused a hullabaloo, as you might imagine. I didn’t think to check the Settings app until we were 4 replies and one whole morning deep. Obviously, I was deeply embarrassed - so much so that I actually considered lying about the cause - but I told him the truth and received the most patient *no problem, good to know* in the history of the world.

I’m not sure if Federico and company still use Git to collaborate between each other, but I continue to do so [publicly](https://github.com/extratone/bilge/tree/main/drafts/). In fact, it’s more likely than not you can still see [this very draft I’m whittling on](https://github.com/extratone/bilge/blob/main/drafts/On%20Drafts%20and%20Obsidian.md#L0) - along with its entire composition/revision history - whenever you’re reading, given how often I forget to move completed work from `drafts/` to `posts/`.

I’m one hundred percent positive I spent far, *far* more time reading about and updating plugins than I did actually *writing* in Obsidian. Just now, I finally rid my repository of the last of their files, and they numbered almost one *thousand*. Just configuration files. Participation in the fiddling was fun and exciting, but it didn’t exactly lend well to productivity. I found myself in a very specific cycle: whenever a new functionaility or integration was shouted about in Obsidian, I would search to see if it already existed in Drafts. It sounds ridiculous, but I tell you I did not find a single case where my findings were not at least “equivalent” to what Obsidian users/developers had rigged up - in the vast majority of cases, I found them vastly more ideal, more robust, and better documented. Eventually, I dropped Obsidian altogether and honestly, [I’m still going](https://bilge.world/drafts-zalgo-action) down that path without it, entirely.

There is tremendous value in the hype surrounding whatever writing app is currently trending. A trip not so far back in the *MacStories* archives reveals that just [four years ago or so](https://club.macstories.net/posts/compiling-and-exporting-tagged-notes-in-drafts-5), Drafts was having its’ own moment [after the release of Drafts 5](https://club.macstories.net/posts/interview-greg-pierce-1). [Tim Nahumck's review for *MacStories*](https://www.macstories.net/reviews/drafts-5-the-macstories-review/) was quite celebratory. Rosemary Orchard - undeniably the queen of automation on Apple Devices - also [praised it in her review](https://rosemaryorchard.com/blog/my-drafts-5-review/). I can tell you that no major release of any Windows application I use regularly has ever gotten such attention as Drafts 5, even - at least, not in my lifetime. Perhaps this is for the better, but I think not. Anyway, that topic is for [another time](https://github.com/extratone/bilge/issues/292).

> There will always be advantages to being fully native on the platform.

Said Greg Pierce, Drafts creator, quoting from [his 2018 interview with *MacStories*](https://club.macstories.net/posts/interview-greg-pierce-1). When I hear “fully native,” I think of Drafts, of course, but also [Tweetbot](http://bilge.world/tweetbot-6-ios-review) and [Bear](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/bear-markdown-notes/id1016366447) - all three of which are coded mostly in Objective C, if I’m not mistaken. I think of them as the most robust third-party applications I’ve ever used on any platform. Among Drafts specific advantages as a native app are [direct Siri Shortcuts integration](https://www.macstories.net/reviews/drafts-5-4-siri-shortcuts-wordpress-and-more/), extensive [URL scheme/x-callback-url support](https://docs.getdrafts.com/docs/automation/urlschemes)[^3], the best [iCloud syncing](https://docs.getdrafts.com/docs/settings/sync) I’ve ever seen from any application on iOS and macOS, a legendary share sheet-bound [web capture extension](https://docs.getdrafts.com/docs/extensions/share), the ability to send full draft contents from [an iMessage app](https://docs.getdrafts.com/docs/extensions/message), an award-winning [Apple Watch app](https://docs.getdrafts.com/docs/extensions/applewatch), gorgeous, configurable, and actually useful(!) [widgets](https://docs.getdrafts.com/docs/extensions/widgets), and even iOS and macOS [icon badge support](https://docs.getdrafts.com/docs/settings/notifications), among an extensive list of others.

## Sending

For instance, with a single keyboard shortcut (`^M`,) I can send the full contents of my current draft to an email address of my choice without leaving the app. The same also applies to sending via SMS (`⌥M`, if you care to know.)[^4] I was able to configure these vie the public [Mail Action Wizard](https://tools.getdrafts.com/wizards/mail) and [Messages Action Wizard](https://tools.getdrafts.com/wizards/message), respectively, and they work across iOS, iPadOS and macOS, out of the box, incredibly. I also used the latter to configure an action which sends messages to my [Family Tech Support iMessage group](https://bilge.world/ios-15-family-review) - a mix of 10 digit phone numbers and email addresses - astonishingly easily. It sends messages with the current draft title as the subject line and the body text as the message body.

![Sending Drafts from iMessage](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43663476/154845607-1dc5e1c5-759a-4030-84ab-d609491f7acb.png)

If I couldn’t be bothered with configuring my own actions, I could use the aforementioned iMessage App to send whole drafts to whomever. (I just noticed that even *it* reflects the current theme.) Note in the screenshot embedded above the header that one can not only *send* draft contents to [Bear](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/bear-markdown-notes/id1016366447), but they can actually *command* virtually all of the configurable editor settings from within Drafts. This is enabled via the also aforementioned URL scheme and x-callback-url support in Drafts.

## System/Working Copy Folder Access

With my current Drafts setup, I need only hit `⇧^⌥D` to push my current draft to *The Psalms*’ [drafts folder](https://github.com/extratone/bilge/tree/main/drafts/) in [Working Copy](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/working-copy-git-client/id896694807) - the golden standard iOS Git client. The same applies with the keyboard shortcut `⇧^⌥N` and the corresponding notes draft and the [/notes repo folder](https://github.com/extratone/bilge/tree/main/notes/). On my iPhone, I’m currently switching back and forth between these using `⌥3` and `⌥4`, respectfully. If you’d like to see, here are those two (unlisted actions) on the Drafts Action Directory: [Export Psalms Drafts](https://actions.getdrafts.com/a/1wL) & [Export Psalms Notes](https://actions.getdrafts.com/a/1wM). 

I also have [an action](https://actions.getdrafts.com/a/1wN) that saves to root iCloud Drive folder called “Written” with the keyboard command `⌥⌘S`. 

[1] Usually of a much more directed sort.
[2] Yes, a real shot. I promise.
[3] Consider that Drafts creator, Greg Pierce, also *invented* x-callback-urls.
[4] Those actions can be examined: [Drakesville](https://actions.getdrafts.com/a/1wR) & [SMS Drakesville](https://actions.getdrafts.com/a/1wS).
