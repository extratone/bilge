Undoubtedly, the most creatively productive person in my family is my brother-in-law, Carlos Gabriel Ruiz, who somehow manages to take of a houseold, raise a preteen son, work a full-time iOS dev job of the most tedious, high-grade sort, *and* churn out visual and written work on a regular basis. Something he told me last year has been on my mind nearly every day, since: his preferred word processor is Ye Olde FinalDraft, in which he still uses the same templates he configured in college. (That was quite a while ago.) I’ve thought about it every day as I’ve spent an inquantifiable amount of time Just Fucking Around with my “workflow,” and reading other professional accounts of Just Fucking Around with workflows[^1] these past eighteen months.

I tried Obsidian. In fact - and I'm still not one hundred percent positive about this - I'm pretty sure I first tried Obsidian several years ago, though the Obsidian.md domain only stretches back to [April of 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200410075559/https://obsidian.md/), so I might just be nuts. Regardless, something said by *MacStories* founder and Definitive iPad Professional, Federico Viticci, in an issue of *MacStories Weekly* from late Summer really... leapt out to me.

> At its core, Obsidian is a Markdown text editor. Just point the app to a folder on your iPhone or iPad and you're ready to get started. The app is based on web technologies, which means it is highly customizable. Obsidian supports a theming system, with a wide variety of themes provided by the app's vibrant community of users and plugins to extend the app's functionality. The app's primary views are its editor and preview mode, which can be split into multiple panes both vertically and horizontally. Obsidian also supports saved workspaces that allow users to open a predefined group of notes easily, commands for quickly opening documents and accessing the app's features, along with extensive, customizable keyboard shortcut support. Of course, notes can be linked internally, allowing for the creation of a wiki-like web of documents.

In the interim, I've reviewed these few sentences over and over again, trying to find the discrepancy, but basically the core of my issue is that **Federico is describing *Drafts* as I know it, word for word**. In fact, since you're here, bear with me just a second as I misquote him, replacing the word "Obsidian" with "Drafts:"

Now, there are several points I probably wouldn't *start out with* when describing Drafts. While you absolutely can "point [Drafts] to a folder on your iPhone or iPad" and be ready to "get started," [Folder Bookmarks](https://docs.getdrafts.com/docs/settings/bookmarks) *are* a fairly recent feature for Drafts, and not exactly configured *out of the box*. It is not - nor will it ever be - local filesystem native like Obsidian, but honestly - especially as an iCloud+ subscriber with 2TB of iCloud Storage - I'm not sure this should be left as a downside. Though I use a Git-enabled system to track revisions (which [I basically learned from Federico](https://www.macstories.net/ios/my-markdown-writing-and-collaboration-workflow-powered-by-working-copy-3-6-icloud-drive-and-github/)!,) I've honestly had much more success configuring specific actions tied to specific folders and keyboard shortcuts than I did running off the filesystem with Obsidian for the few months-long period I gave it a shot, last year.

I’m positive I spent more time reading about and updating plugins than I did actually *writing* in Obsidian. This was fun and exciting, but it didn’t exactly lend well to productivity. I found myself in a very specific cycle: whenever a new functionaility or integration was shouted about in Obsidian, I would search to see if it already existed in Drafts. It sounds ridiculous, but I tell you I did not find a single case where my findings were not at least “equivalent” to what Obsidian users/developers had rigged up - in the vast majority of cases, I found them vastly more ideal, more robust, and better documented. Eventually, I dropped Obsidian altogether and honestly, [I’m still going](https://bilge.world/drafts-zalgo-action).

There is tremendous value in the hype surrounding whatever writing app is currently trending. A trip not so far back in the *MacStories* archives reveals that just [four years ago or so](https://club.macstories.net/posts/compiling-and-exporting-tagged-notes-in-drafts-5), Drafts was having its’ own moment after the release of Drafts 5.
