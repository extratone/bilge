# The Psalms' 2020

## Screens and software subjects big & small discussed within my most moderate 35,000 words ever.

Believe it or not, the cyclical cold season has once again come to pass! Oh, the [W̘͖̯E̟̹À̫T̯̫͓̪̮͓̼H̝E̪͇̰̘̖͍ͅŔ͍̖̱̟̪](https://youtu.be/qg0ZPmSux_4)!! If the past two days on Twitter were any indication, it is indeed time for a year's-end retrospective on what has been published on this Web Site. Given the extent of the attention I've devoted to bilge.world this past year - both technically and editorially - I thought it would be nice to chuck in a bit more in the pursuit of whacking myself on the back.

## Spring

The earliest archive.org capture of this particular Writeas blog dates back only to [May 1st of this year](https://web.archive.org/web/20200501203946/https://bilge.world/), but its stylistic contrast with the site's current version is immense. I believe I was using [Max Henderson's Anxiety theme](https://write.as/themes/anxiety) virtually stock, albeit with some color rearrangements. By the [29th](http://web.archive.org/web/20200529000327/https://bilge.world/), I had already arrived upon the colors you see today. "[You Know I'm Blogging](https://bilge.world/you-know-im-blogging)" was just a meta update to say *howdy* after such a long drought, but "[Dirty Dave's Poweruser Tips](https://bilge.world/poweruser-tips-software-shortcuts)" actually proved popular (for me) among my newly-connected Fedi crowd, especially, thanks to [an annotated share by Writeas on Twitter](https://twitter.com/writeas__/status/1252704432497836034). Honestly, it was entirely worth it just for the accomplishment of [exposing my platform peer Dino Bansigan to **Alt+D**](https://journal.dinobansigan.com/dirty-daves-poweruser-tips-david-blue). Writeas Community Manager CJ Eller and I began corresponding, which led to [an interview](https://write.as/community/chat-with-david-blue) regarding writing tools, managing fiddly compulsions, and the wonder of Markdown.

> I think I'm just now coming around to understanding personal blogging and the freedom that entails. It's been a long while since I've had the urge to write about things on which I don't consider myself at least somewhat of an authority. I think – like many people – I originally just used my personal blog as a guinea pig for messing around with themes, and I'm just now actually catching up on some of the lesser items on my “to-write” list.

I dug deep in my long-overdue todo list for "[Z̴͏a͞l͟g͝o͏ ̕G͟͝e͞n͞҉è̛ŗ͡a͝͞t̴o҉r͞ for iOS](https://bilge.world/zalgo-generator-ios-app-review)," which - along with [my 2018 review of Unichar](https://bilge.world/unichar-for-ios-app-review) - I felt was a necessary celebration of digital text as a weapon, which is very dear to me. "[Preferred Writing Instruments](https://bilge.world/preferred-writing-instruments)" was probably the singular analog departure *The Psalms* will ever see and my condensed commentary on [*Star Trek: Picard*](https://bilge.world/star-trek-picard-review), [*Star Trek: Discovery*](https://bilge.world/star-trek-discovery-review), and [the current state of *Star Trek: Online*](https://bilge.world/star-trek-online) should fulfill all need mention of science fiction, here, for a very long time. Given [yesterday's news regarding Slack's acquisition](https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/1/21719666/salesforce-slack-acquisition-purchase-announced), perhaps I should feel revalidated in my insistence that "[Discord is Better Than Slack](https://bilge.world/discord-slack-comparison)," but a developer friend of mine actually addressed my curiosity regarding why startups never mention Discord as a workplace option, despite its identical functionality: it's all about fuckin' *enterprise security*.

I had wanted to write about [*The Langoliers*](https://letterboxd.com/film/the-langoliers/) - Stephen King's flop of a made-for-TV movie/extended *Twilight Zone* episode - for a long while. It was probably the first program I watched as a child that genuinely disturbed me and always returns to my thoughts by barren-ish experiences. I had planned to watch the whole three hours all the way through and write whatever came to mind, but I only made it halfway or so in "[Craig Toomey's Coronavirus](https://bilge.world/the-langoliers-stephen-king)" before I ran completely out of steam. I dropped what I had without revision, to this day. Perhaps one day I shall return...

> In the right hour, the woodland springtime metamorphic processes of the neighboring Lake Geneva suburb’s in-betweens were in a paused state – the toads again hushed; the crickets tired, and the human populace, too. In the right hour, the fickle wind and the social owls were the only sound, and nothing moved but the sparse, light-footed doe in careful segments with her fawn.

These two sentences begin the sixth chapter of my indefinitely-postponed novel, [*Blimp's Burden*](https://github.com/extratone/pith), and are almost certainly my best writing, ever. My vanity simply wouldn't allow them to go forgotten, so I [published the chapter as an excerpt on *The Psalms*](https://bilge.world/blimps-burden-chapter-6). It may seem an intimidating wall of text, but give it your attention and you'll be amused, I think.
