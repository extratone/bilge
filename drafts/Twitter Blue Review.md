Incredibly, the second most powerful social media company in the world has finally managed to implement a paid subscription model, as I’ve been begging them to do for [at least 5 years](https://twitter.com/neoyokel/status/696094018862718976), now. For three U.S. Dollars a month, “[Twitter Blue](https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2021/introducing-twitter-blue)” is [now available](https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/9/22766286/twitter-blue-subscription-service-scroll-nuzzel-undo-tweets-ad-free-articles-us) for all United States users.

## Undo Tweet

Perhaps unlike you, *I* have never had a problem understanding why “editable” Tweets will never exist, largely thanks to [my conversation with Eugen Rochko](https://hyp.is/znp7tEQJEeySOXvhkqI2DQ/bilge.world/eugen-rochko-interview) about implementing editable posts on Mastodon:

> That won't happen. There's actually a good reason why they don't do that. It's simply because you could make a toot about one thing, have people favorite it and share it, link it from other places, and then suddenly, it says 'Heil Hitler,' or something.
