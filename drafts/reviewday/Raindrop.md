# Raindrop
[[App Store Review Day]]

At this moment, if you’re paying for any other bookmarking/aggregation/curatorial software (ahem, Pocket,) you need to look into a Raindrop subscription *right now.*

If you *get paid* as a curator of any sort of web content, *stop what you’re doing right now* and investigate the capabilities of Raindrop as a platform-universal (and yet web native) extremely and beautifully configurable software and service. 

As someone who has curated a variety of media on the web both personally and professionally since the days of *clipping Evernote pages*, Raindrop answered so many of my most bothersome needs/peevs…

The best software, I’ve found, is always the hardest to quantify in this sort of space. All I can tell you is that Raindrop somehow overtook functions of several other apps I was using **because it is focused at being good at one thing.** I’ll spare you the tens of thousands of words I’d no doubt need to explain this to myself.

I have on multiple occasions submitted feature requests and heard back immediately from Rustem. I have also watched a few I shared with other get implemented *before my eyes*. 

I am instructing you to try it immediately.
