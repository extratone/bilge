I’d lusted after Iconfactory’s [Tot](https://tot.rocks) for its app icons for a long time, but it wasn’t until a sale at the beginning of the year that I actually dove in and bought [Tot Pocket](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/tot-pocket/id1498235191) - the iOS app. As a primarily iPhone-bound user, now, I’ve found it extremely handy as a container for URL-scheme-powered links, largely to run Siri Shortcuts and open specific drafts in [Drafts](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/drafts/id1435957248).

Tot’s had its own URL scheme all along, which I utilized in two published Drafts actions: “[Append to 7th Tot Dot](https://actions.getdrafts.com/a/1uL)” (which works cross-platform) and “[Fetch Contents of # Tot Dot](https://actions.getdrafts.com/a/1ub)” (which uses Applescript and is therefore macOS-only.)
