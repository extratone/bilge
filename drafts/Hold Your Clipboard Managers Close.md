Though they’re still largely relegated to “[poweruser](https://bilge.world/poweruser-tips-software-shortcuts)” considerations in the mainstream consumer technology eye, clipboard managers have massive potential to make our computing lives better, even on iOS. There was one, in particular, which was universally loved and - if I might add, including myself - universally taken for granted, called Copied. Purchase records show I personally bought “Copied Touch” on iOS in October of 2018, but I think that was actually my second purchase of the app. It was once my primary clipboard manager on iOS. In fact, I was using copied long before I had any familiarity with the term “clipboard manager.”

Around April of last year, I noticed that Copied (the most recent version of the app) was not shareable from the App Store. I [reached out](https://app.sparkmailapp.com/web-share/YQYdGyL3Uv-lWXAJIoxWsQFM5QAdfkkqI64y44Ni) to Kevin Chang, Copied’s sole developer, regarding this, and the response was quite solemn:

> Hello,
> **Unfortunately, Copied has been removed from the App Store due to a patent infringement claim. I’m not sure if it will be temporary or permanent yet. Please request a refund from the App Store.**
> Kevin

Through Tweets - some active via Twitter search, others passively received - I managed to find myself the Token Carrier of Bad Tidings regarding Copied’s death, which is, I suppose, a burden I am more than willing to bear.
