*Please note that I am in no way qualified as a literary reviewer, and this is not exactly what I would describe as a book review. If you're searching for such a thing, [my Amazon review](https://www.notion.so/rotund/Track-Changes-Amazon-Review-f37424815d144e978805511838da0fee) was written for a more expressly-product-critical purpose and should provide a more succinct analysis.*
