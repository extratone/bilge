## Peep this dope listicle of iPhone Pro Tips

It became most apparent during my research for my iPhone 12 Pro Max Review that Apple’s mobile operating system and all that it entails has changed profoundly over the course of its history even moreso than is immediately obvious. The operating system that thwarted the very idea of the Power User currently has numerous features that were added explicitly for them. (One might suggest this really began in iOS 12, with [Siri Shortcuts](http://bilge.world/siri-shortcuts-ios12-review).) The trouble is that many of these features overlap into what the most average user might use in their day-to-day operation of their handsets and tablets. **Showing timestamps in iMessage**, for instance, is a function which one should not have to stumble upon or take to an internet search to find. (<u>Swipe from right to left in a conversation</u>.) Little functions like this are incredibly poorly documented, considering iOS is maintained by the most valuable company in the history of the world.

Apple does make an effort to educate new users, mainly through the [Tips app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/tips/id1069509450), which has indeed become more useful and insightful over time, but still leaves a whole lot to be desired. They also publish an owner’s manual-esque *[iPhone Users Guide](https://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewBook?id=1515995528)*, which is unfortunately completely inaccessible in any format outside of the native Books app. (I made a not-insignificant effort to convert the volume to a PDF for your sake, but found myself completely defeated by DRM, hilariously.) Some of the functions listed in this post are accompanied by links to Apple Support web pages, but far too many have no such entries, which - from my perspective - is absolutely inexcusable on Apple’s part. Inexcusable, but perhaps not inexplicable. 

It would seem that the vast ecosystem of both professional and amateur technology media which reports on iOS has inadvertently filled in for Apple in the role of documentarian. Search YouTube for “iPhone Tips” and you’ll manifest a multitude of results with titles like *[16 ACTUAL iPhone Tricks You Didn’t Know Existed!](https://youtu.be/YKOY6-ZdUo8)* which haphazardly (and often distastefully) do the company’s job for them.
