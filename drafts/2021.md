# The Psalms’ 2021

*I am not funny anymore* feels as though it has finally achieved penultimate meaning as a longtime habitual phrase of mine - as in, I can no longer remember a tangible self without that sentiment always at the ready in a handy intercranial stash. Its significant, I think - the assuredness of my confidence saying it, now, after the year two thousand and twenty-one. The sensation of it has always been most powerful when reading the oldest of my words published, here, but it now has *so* much more substance. The argument that this general process is the very most natural for my age - the *Peak Specialization* Period on the general Human Existence roadmap - has been platituded to all fuck, and yet I cling to it newly and with ever-renewed desperation as I have to any and all authentic manifestations of certainty, of late - even the *common knowledge* sort I still viscerally despise.

Certainly moreso than in any other calendar year for *this blog*, I have changed, and so has the tone, theme, and subject matter of the eleven items you see above. In case you can't be bothered, it doesn't take much scrutiny to note that all but *one* of these entries - [the second-latest](https://bilge.world/uniiqu3-techno-is-black), debatably - are directly related to the Fucking Apple Phone. Indeed, The Year of our Lord 2021 saw me watch every single one of Apple's two billion special "live" events in their entirety, all the while marveling... screaming... at the overwhelming volume of completely indiscriminate hype that still pervades the greater *vaguely interested in consumer tech* online biosphere. I witnessed folks take days off work solely for the sake of these pre-recorded “live” events, listened to pre-show podcast gameshows involving real money bets on what might be discussed/released during said events, and subscribed to two exclusive iOS-related publications: [Matthew Cassinelli’s newsletter](https://matthewcassinelli.com/membership) and [Club MacStories](https://club.macstories.net).

Separate the blogroll, I indulged resolutely in [a severe App Addiction](https://bit.ly/dbapplist), published [a bunch of Siri Shortcuts](https://routinehub.co/user/blue), frequented [r/Shortcuts](https://www.reddit.com/r/shortcuts) more than I ever thought I'd find myself doing so on Read It, subsequently investing more of my time than ever in personal automation on Apple devices, while also becoming [most critical of the practice](https://github.com/extratone/bilge/blob/main/audio/Voice%20Notes/The%20Siri%20Shortcuts%20Industry.mp3). I first described myself as an "iPhone Poweruser" some four years ago, in [a rambly episode of *End User*](https://www.listennotes.com/podcasts/end-user/siri-shortcuts-are-ios-12s--Vlsfa8engC/) immediately following my original discovery of Apple's absorption of the automation app Workflow and its rebrand of their work into "Siri Shortcuts" [in the beta of iOS 12](https://bilge.world/siri-shortcuts-ios12-review). If indeed this label was ever meaningfully appropriate to self-apply, it certainly should be, now. Before 2021, my knowledge of iOS as a platform was extensive, sure, but notably constrained to user considerations. I was completely unaware of any "dev-facing" interworkings. For instance, I now have a vague understanding of Apple's late push to change iOS' primary programming language from Objective-C to its own Swift thanks to my "[investigation](https://twitter.com/tapbot_paul/status/1421600511808229387)" into why Tweetbot "feels" so different from its contemporaries. As per [my commitment to write the missing documentation for Bluetooth keyboard shortcuts support on iPhone](https://uikeycommand.neocities.org)[^1], I have even become familiar enough with SwiftUI to identify a given key command's result in source code.

## Editorially

The most significant editorial initiative of the year was [my complete rewrite](https://github.com/extratone/bilge/issues/96) of [/About](https://bilge.world/about). In the interest of providing a much more succinct and informative logline, I took direct and obvious inspiration from [the About document](https://www.notion.so/About-Platformer-22cd48a5514d404b9c2dd130d7724b93) Casey Newton drafted for his newsletter, [*Platformer*](https://platformer.news). I expected the process to take months on end, but the end product was mostly written in a single sitting. This excerpt is as close to a Statement of Purpose for *The Psalms* as I've ever come: 

> ...observing and selectively amplifying the characters, organizations, and stories surrounding the most abrupt, profound, and spectacular communicative renaissance in the history of the human species. Less abstractly, its beat is **wholly digital**, namely in **tools** (software, services, and methodologies) and **culture** (music, film, podcasts, and media) from a distinct lens established at good distance from California.

Also included is a list of important editorial considerations, most of which could be interpreted as complaints about the general state of "technology media" at present.
