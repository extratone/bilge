# iOS 15 “Review”

Here we are again: I have found myself compelled to comment on the latest numerical iteration of Apple, Inc.’s mobile operating system - the platform we can all agree, surely, that should definitively represent the peak of _ease-of-use_ in consumer technology. It was first announced at perhaps the very last entirely-virtual, pre-shot World Wide Developer Conference in yet another extremely-produced, lustless series of presentations. Since I’ve gone deeper than ever into iOS, this year, I made an equally forceful effort to feed off the hype from every one of the new, Apple-specific social channels I’ve subscribed to. Somehow, I even survived the appearance of [a motherfucking _Back to the Future_ reference](https://twitter.com/neoyokel/status/1401947729836773377) in the very first few frames of the live stream.
