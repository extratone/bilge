# How to Fuck Text

![TextFuckHeaderImage](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43663476/153741149-a149b9b4-bb62-47a8-9991-44904bdcfc03.jpeg)

## A guide on digital text fuckery (largely on iOS) from one of the world’s foremost authorities.

My [project to properly document Bluetooth keyboard support on iPhone](https://uikeycommand.com) has given me a new reverence for accessibility, generally, which might come as a hypocritical statement at the beginning of such a piece, but I *did* [explicitly ask you](https://mastodon.social/@DavidBlue/107589034582138302) if you felt this subject was anti-accessibility before I officially embarked upon writing This Post. I don't consider the answer - a very weak "no" - to be an all-encompassing excuse, whatsoever. If you feel this post's existence has the potential to do real harm, [contact me](https://davidblue.wtf/db.vcf) and I *will* straight up take it down. I dare you. Since I consider myself a genuine authority on Text Fucking, however, I am going to do my best to main unapologetic language when expressing opinions in orbit of the matter. You can trust me, I think.

Here’s my definition from [the “Text Fucking” entry](https://github.com/extratone/bilge/wiki/Text-Fucking) in [*The Psalms* wiki](https://github.com/extratone/bilge/wiki):

**Text Fucking** *verb*
a.) hardcore text manipulation.
b.) destruction of usable digital text.

I won’t say Text Fucking is an art. Indeed, perhaps it is anti-art. It *is* a discipline, nearly. At least enough so that I believe this Post is worth it[^1]. Like most disciplines, it can be used for your particular definitions of “good” and/or “bad.” I would like to think most of my use over the years has been toward my own of “good,” but - as per the unsearchable nature of Fucked Text, generally - this is not easily verifiable or citable.

## History

As detailed in the audio account embedded above, I believe my Text Fucking career began somewhere around the 7th grade, at 13-14 years old. It was my second or third time flunking MS02 - the Microsoft Office II course - taken on fairly outdated school desktop machines in the 2007-2008 era, all running Windows XP. Because of some inexplicable ability to simply do what I was told, I would spend class periods trying to create the largest possible text file in Notepad by copying and pasting huge, exponentially growing globs. Eventually, I did crash a machine at least once. Though it could very well be simply the self-exaggerated recollection of preteendom, I even remember crashing the school server with one of those files.

My Text Fucking reached its peak proliferation in [the Drywall Era](https://drywallmusic.tumblr.com), when I first discovered the magic of Zalgo Text. The original generator at eemo.net has been replaced by an exact duplicate at [eeemo.net](http://eeemo.net). I have actually managed to successfully duplicate it [on my own NeoCities website](https://davidblue.wtf/zalgo/), as well. You might say that this original Zalgo Generator is The Original Text Fucking Tool. It can still generate quantities of fucked digital text information that *will* Fuck Shit Up on any social network, and as far as I can tell, the entire program is contained within [a single HTML file](https://davidblue.wtf/zalgo/index.html).

As Drywall’s first and second albums - “[Hamura](https://ihadtopee.bandcamp.com/album/hamura)” and “[Suburban Anarchy](https://ihadtopee.bandcamp.com/album/suburban-anarchy),” respectively - were studies in [audio clipping](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clipping_(audio)), I felt strongly at the time that Z̸̡̤̯̰̮͈͙̆ͤ̿ͨa̢̓̀̓ͤl̡̨̩̼g̸̡̝̣̹͖̀̕͜҉o̡̞̊̓̓̔͝͡ T̘͛͢҉̹̉̀ͫe̶̗̠̲͛҉̱̙͇ͬx̧̡͈͍͕͘t͎̘̠̺ͨ͘ was the digital text equivalent. In fact, I couldn’t have imagined a more apt way to describe it. Beyond The Rails was my cringey “label” name, directly describing this phenomenon. Indeed, Zalgo Text goes beyond the “rails” of text input/display fields reliably, depending on the intensity of the configuration you’re using to create it.

## Apps

The core necessity of any good text fucker is a robust text editing and/or word processing application. Zalgo text is a real bitch for Electron apps like my dearest [Typora](https://typora.io), unfortunately. On iOS, this summation also applies to [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md), I’m afraid. I recommend native apps like [Drafts](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/drafts/id1435957248) (big surprise) - which astonishingly has [**its very own native Zalgo action**](https://directory.getdrafts.com/a/1vM) as developer Greg’s [gift to me](https://twitter.com/draftsapp/status/1492645727729766400)! - and [Bear](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/bear-markdown-notes/id1016366447) (no less of a surprise.) Here are some more particularly robust text editors on iOS:
- [Kodex](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/kodex/id1038574481)
- [Koder](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/koder-code-editor/id1447489375)
- [Taio](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/taio-markdown-text-actions/id1527036273)
- [Typewriter](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/typewriter-for-markdown/id1556419263)
- [Runestone](https://testflight.apple.com/join/Q6S1cuCd) (Beta)

If that’s not enough for you, I suggest perusing [Brett Terpstra’s iTextEditors Wiki](https://brettterpstra.com/ios-text-editors).

I have previously reviewed two wonderful Text Fucking iOS apps on this blog: [**UniChar**](https://bilge.world/unichar-for-ios-app-review) and [**Zalgo Generator**](https://bilge.world/zalgo-generator-ios-app-review). There’s now [a macOS version of the latter](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/zalgo-generator/id1304137527) which is particularly powerful. Or at least has particularly powerful implications. There are a few more to be discovered, though:

### Textcraft

Textcraft, by Aviary and Mast creator, Shihab Meboob, has become my goto Text Fucking app - even above Zalgo Generator, I’m sad to say - on both [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/textcraft/id1546719359) and [macOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/textcraft/id1546719359).

![Textcraft for macOS](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43663476/153737944-46db7da5-6d85-41da-abd1-78a54bb58b99.png)

![TextExpanderIcon](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43663476/153726269-6d8cee5d-116b-4b28-99a0-91842e502456.png)

### TextExpander

Another cross-platform application - this one [extending to Windows](https://textexpander.com/download), too - TextExpander has very recently become an integral part of my day-to-day creative life. It’s used by professionals at companies with "thousands of people," supposedly, to “expand” any sort of text, set off scripts (on macOS,) and paste fill in-able templates. These functions are divided into “[snippets](https://textexpander.com/learn/getting-started)” as part of “[snippet groups](https://textexpander.com/learn/getting-started/getting-started-for-admin).” In fact, I’ve created [**a dedicated snippet group to accompany this guide**](https://app.textexpander.com/public/12c50fb2360617d3cc66d757cf26383b). You can view all my TextExpander snippets in [this GitHub Repository](https://github.com/extratone/TextExpander).

![TextFuckSnippetGroup](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43663476/153726468-25b5a5a9-0381-4720-b1e7-c7fb2ef357d9.png)

It’s not much just yet, but if you “[subscribe](https://app.textexpander.com/public/12c50fb2360617d3cc66d757cf26383b)” to this snippet group from your own account, you’ll be treated to whatever I come up with in the future, delivered to your devices in real time. 


## Siri Shortcuts

Another method of general Text Fuckery on iOS is through its relatively new personal automation system, Siri Shortcuts.
