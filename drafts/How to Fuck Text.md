# How to Fuck Text

![TextFuckHeaderImage](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43663476/153741149-a149b9b4-bb62-47a8-9991-44904bdcfc03.jpeg)

## A guide on digital text fuckery (largely on iOS) from one of the world’s foremost authorities.

My [project to properly document Bluetooth keyboard support on iPhone](https://uikeycommand.com) has given me a new reverence for accessibility, generally, which might come as a hypocritical statement at the beginning of such a piece, but I *did* [explicitly ask you](https://mastodon.social/@DavidBlue/107589034582138302) if you felt this subject was anti-accessibility before I officially embarked upon writing This Post. I don't consider the answer - a very weak "no" - to be an all-encompassing excuse, whatsoever. If you feel this post's existence has the potential to do real harm, [contact me](https://davidblue.wtf/db.vcf) and I *will* straight up take it down. I dare you. Since I consider myself a genuine authority on Text Fucking, however, I am going to do my best to main unapologetic language when expressing opinions in orbit of the matter. You can trust me, I think.

Here’s my definition from [the “Text Fucking” entry](https://github.com/extratone/bilge/wiki/Text-Fucking) in [*The Psalms* wiki](https://github.com/extratone/bilge/wiki):

**Text Fucking** *verb*
a.) hardcore text manipulation.
b.) destruction of usable digital text.

I won’t say Text Fucking is an art. Indeed, perhaps it is anti-art. It *is* a discipline, nearly. At least enough so that I believe this Post is worth it[^1]. Like most disciplines, it can be used for your particular definitions of “good” and/or “bad.” I would like to think most of my use over the years has been toward my own of “good,” but - as per the unsearchable nature of Fucked Text, generally - this is not easily verifiable or citable.

## History

As detailed in the audio account embedded above, I believe my Text Fucking career began somewhere around the 7th grade, at 13-14 years old. It was my second or third time flunking MS02 - the Microsoft Office II course - taken on fairly outdated school desktop machines in the 2007-2008 era, all running Windows XP. Because of some inexplicable ability to simply do what I was told, I would spend class periods trying to create the largest possible text file in Notepad by copying and pasting huge, exponentially growing globs. Eventually, I did crash a machine at least once. Though it could very well be simply the self-exaggerated recollection of preteendom, I even remember crashing the school server with one of those files.

My Text Fucking reached its peak proliferation in [the Drywall Era](https://drywallmusic.tumblr.com), when I first discovered the magic of Zalgo Text. The original generator at eemo.net has been replaced by an exact duplicate at [eeemo.net](http://eeemo.net). I have actually managed to successfully duplicate it [on my own NeoCities website](https://davidblue.wtf/zalgo/), as well. You might say that this original Zalgo Generator is The Original Text Fucking Tool. It can still generate quantities of fucked digital text information that *will* Fuck Shit Up on any social network, and as far as I can tell, the entire program is contained within [a single HTML file](https://davidblue.wtf/zalgo/index.html).

As Drywall’s first and second albums - “[Hamura](https://ihadtopee.bandcamp.com/album/hamura)” and “[Suburban Anarchy](https://ihadtopee.bandcamp.com/album/suburban-anarchy),” respectively - were studies in [audio clipping](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clipping_(audio)), I felt strongly at the time that Zalgo Text was the digital text equivalent. In fact, I couldn’t have imagined a more apt way to describe it. *Beyond The Rails* was my cringey “label” name, directly describing this phenomenon. Indeed, Zalgo Text goes beyond the “rails” of text input/display fields reliably, depending on the intensity of the configuration you’re using to create it. 

## Apps

The core necessity of any good text fucker is a robust text editing and/or word processing application. Zalgo text is a real bitch for Electron apps like my dearest [Typora](https://typora.io), unfortunately. On iOS, this summation also applies to [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md), I’m afraid. I recommend native apps like [Drafts](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/drafts/id1435957248) (big surprise) - which astonishingly has [**its very own native Zalgo action**](https://actions.getdrafts.com/a/1vM) as developer Greg’s [gift to me](https://twitter.com/draftsapp/status/1492645727729766400)! - and [Bear](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/bear-markdown-notes/id1016366447) (no less of a surprise.) In terms of default configuration intensity, the Drafts action hits the sweet spot out of the box.

If you don't believe me, here are some more particularly robust text editors on iOS:

- [Kodex](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/kodex/id1038574481)
- [Koder](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/koder-code-editor/id1447489375)
- [Taio](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/taio-markdown-text-actions/id1527036273)
- [Typewriter](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/typewriter-for-markdown/id1556419263)
- [Runestone](https://testflight.apple.com/join/Q6S1cuCd) (Beta)

If that’s not enough for you, I suggest perusing [Brett Terpstra’s iTextEditors Wiki](https://brettterpstra.com/ios-text-editors).

I have previously reviewed two wonderful Text Fucking iOS apps on this blog: [**UniChar**](https://bilge.world/unichar-for-ios-app-review) and [**Zalgo Generator**](https://bilge.world/zalgo-generator-ios-app-review). There’s now [a macOS version of the latter](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/zalgo-generator/id1304137527) which is particularly powerful. Or at least has particularly powerful implications. There are a few more to be discovered, though:

### Textcraft

[**Textcraft**](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/textcraft/id1546719359), by [Aviary](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/aviary-for-twitter/id1522043420) and [Mast](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mast-for-mastodon/id1437429129) creator, [Shihab Meboob](https://apps.apple.com/us/developer/shihab-mehboob/id1533949185), has become my goto Text Fucking app - even above [Zalgo Generator](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/zalgo-generator/id1304137527), I’m somewhat sad to say - on both iOS and macOS.

![Textcraft for macOS](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43663476/153737944-46db7da5-6d85-41da-abd1-78a54bb58b99.png)

![TextExpanderIcon](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43663476/153726269-6d8cee5d-116b-4b28-99a0-91842e502456.png)

### TextExpander

Another cross-platform application - this one [extending to Windows](https://textexpander.com/download), too - TextExpander has very recently become an integral part of my day-to-day creative life. It’s used by professionals at companies with "thousands of people," supposedly, to “expand” any sort of text, set off scripts (on macOS,) and paste fill in-able templates. These functions are divided into “[snippets](https://textexpander.com/learn/getting-started)” as part of “[snippet groups](https://textexpander.com/learn/getting-started/getting-started-for-admin).” In fact, I’ve created [**a dedicated snippet group to accompany this guide**](https://app.textexpander.com/public/12c50fb2360617d3cc66d757cf26383b). You can view all my TextExpander snippets in [this GitHub Repository](https://github.com/extratone/TextExpander).

![TextFuckSnippetGroup](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43663476/153726468-25b5a5a9-0381-4720-b1e7-c7fb2ef357d9.png)

It’s not much just yet, but if you “[subscribe](https://app.textexpander.com/public/12c50fb2360617d3cc66d757cf26383b)” to this snippet group from your own account, you’ll be treated to whatever I come up with in the future, delivered to your devices in real time. If you find yourself trying it out, you may as well check out my main Snippet Group, [Extratext](https://app.textexpander.com/public/14093096578d4f40eeea15649f5cefbb), which is documented [here](https://davidblue.wtf/extratext). 

## Siri Shortcuts

![TextFuckShortcuts](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43663476/153750918-ca0c5eb6-0d91-4d7f-b70b-550f0f44c528.png)

Another method of general Text Fuckery on iOS is achieved through its relatively new personal automation system, Siri Shortcuts. Through a Reddit thread I've never been able to find again, I discovered a method of randomizing strings of text that led to the creation of the Shortcuts you see below, all with native actions (aside from the outputs of those with specific services.) If you're willing to splurge on the whole 3.3mb, free (for macOS, iPadOS, and iOS) [**Actions app**](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/actions/id1586435171), you can accomplish the same task, but much more quickly and with less resource consumption.
