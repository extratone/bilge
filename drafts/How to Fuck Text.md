# How to Fuck Text

![TextFuckHeaderImage](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43663476/153741149-a149b9b4-bb62-47a8-9991-44904bdcfc03.jpeg)

## A guide on digital text fuckery (largely on iOS) from one of the world’s foremost authorities.

My [project to properly document Bluetooth keyboard support on iPhone](https://uikeycommand.com) has given me a new reverence for accessibility, generally, which might come as a hypocritical statement at the beginning of such a piece, but I *did* [explicitly ask you](https://mastodon.social/@DavidBlue/107589034582138302) if you felt this subject was anti-accessibility before I officially embarked upon writing This Post. I don't consider the answer - a very weak "no" - to be an all-encompassing excuse, whatsoever. If you feel this post's existence has the potential to do real harm, [contact me](https://davidblue.wtf/db.vcf) and I *will* straight up take it down. I dare you. Since I consider myself a genuine authority on Text Fucking, however, I am going to do my best to main unapologetic language when expressing opinions in orbit of the matter. You can trust me, I think.

![Discerning Yelp Connoisseur](https://i.snap.as/K2E9UV7S.png)

Here’s my definition from [the “Text Fucking” entry](https://github.com/extratone/bilge/wiki/Text-Fucking) in [*The Psalms* wiki](https://github.com/extratone/bilge/wiki):

**Text Fucking** *verb*
a.) hardcore text manipulation.
b.) destruction of usable digital text.

I won’t say Text Fucking is an art. Indeed, perhaps it is anti-art. It *is* a discipline, nearly. At least enough so that I believe this Post is worth it[^1]. Like most disciplines, it can be used for your particular definitions of “good” and/or “bad.” I would like to think most of my use over the years has been toward my own of “good,” but - as per the unsearchable nature of Fucked Text, generally - this is not easily verifiable or citable. Regardless of my performance, however, I genuinely believe Text Fucking can be an endeavor that leads to more “positive” outcomes, whoever you may be. As I did, you might find yourself with a greater appreciation of and a desire to learn more about those individuals and organizations working in the Accessible Technology industry, ever toward a more inclusive digital future. It’s my hope that the weaponization of such an otherwise banal part of life might empower you with the simple fact of your capabilities, even if you don’t ever choose to actually implement them in a single instance.

## History

As detailed in the audio account embedded above, I believe my Text Fucking career began somewhere around the 7th grade, at 13-14 years old. It was my second or third time flunking MS02 - the Microsoft Office II course - taken on fairly outdated school desktop machines in the 2007-2008 era, all running Windows XP. Because of some inexplicable ability to simply do what I was told, I would spend class periods trying to create the largest possible text file in Notepad by copying and pasting huge, exponentially growing globs. Eventually, I did crash a machine at least once. Though it could very well be simply the self-exaggerated recollection of preteendom, I even remember crashing the school server with one of those files. They were ginormous for plaintext.

My Text Fucking reached its peak proliferation in [the Drywall Era](https://drywallmusic.tumblr.com), when I first discovered the magic of Zalgo Text. The original generator at eemo.net has been replaced by an exact duplicate at [eeemo.net](http://eeemo.net). I have actually managed to successfully duplicate it [on my own NeoCities website](https://davidblue.wtf/zalgo/), as well. You might say that this original Zalgo Generator is The Original Text Fucking Tool. It can still generate quantities of fucked digital text information that *will* Fuck Shit Up on any social network, and as far as I can tell, the entire program is contained within [a single HTML file](https://davidblue.wtf/zalgo/index.html).

==https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/1492783081593483266== REPLACE

As Drywall’s first and second albums - “[Hamura](https://ihadtopee.bandcamp.com/album/hamura)” and “[Suburban Anarchy](https://ihadtopee.bandcamp.com/album/suburban-anarchy),” respectively - were studies in [audio clipping](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clipping_(audio)), I felt strongly at the time that Zalgo Text was the digital text equivalent. In fact, I couldn’t have imagined a more apt way to describe it. *Beyond The Rails* was my cringey “label” name, directly describing this phenomenon. Indeed, Zalgo Text goes beyond the “rails” of text input/display fields reliably, depending on the intensity of the configuration you’re using to create it.

## Apps

The core necessity of any good text fucker is a robust text editing and/or word processing application. Zalgo text is a real bitch for Electron apps like my dearest [Typora](https://typora.io), unfortunately. On iOS, this summation also applies to [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md), I’m afraid. I recommend native apps like [Drafts](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/drafts/id1435957248) (big surprise) - which astonishingly has [**its very own native Zalgo action**](https://actions.getdrafts.com/a/1vM) as developer Greg’s [gift to me](https://twitter.com/draftsapp/status/1492645727729766400)! - and [Bear](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/bear-markdown-notes/id1016366447) (no less of a surprise.) In terms of default configuration intensity, the Drafts action hits the sweet spot out of the box.

If you don't believe me, here are some more particularly robust text editors on iOS:

- [Kodex](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/kodex/id1038574481)
- [Koder](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/koder-code-editor/id1447489375)
- [Taio](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/taio-markdown-text-actions/id1527036273)
- [Typewriter](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/typewriter-for-markdown/id1556419263)
- [Runestone](https://testflight.apple.com/join/Q6S1cuCd) (Beta)

If that’s not enough for you, I suggest perusing [Brett Terpstra’s iTextEditors Wiki](https://brettterpstra.com/ios-text-editors).

I have previously reviewed two wonderful Text Fucking iOS apps on this blog: [**UniChar**](https://bilge.world/unichar-for-ios-app-review) and [**Zalgo Generator**](https://bilge.world/zalgo-generator-ios-app-review). There’s now [a macOS version of the latter](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/zalgo-generator/id1304137527) which is particularly powerful - or at least has particularly powerful implications. There are a few more to be discovered, though:

### Textcraft

[**Textcraft**](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/textcraft/id1546719359), by [Aviary](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/aviary-for-twitter/id1522043420) and [Mast](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mast-for-mastodon/id1437429129) creator, [Shihab Meboob](https://apps.apple.com/us/developer/shihab-mehboob/id1533949185), has become my goto Text Fucking app - even above [Zalgo Generator](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/zalgo-generator/id1304137527), I’m somewhat sad to say - on both iOS and macOS.

![Textcraft for macOS](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43663476/153737944-46db7da5-6d85-41da-abd1-78a54bb58b99.png)

![TextExpanderIcon](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43663476/153726269-6d8cee5d-116b-4b28-99a0-91842e502456.png)

### TextExpander

Another cross-platform application - this one [extending to Windows](https://textexpander.com/download), too - TextExpander has very recently become an integral part of my day-to-day creative life. It’s used by professionals at companies with "thousands of people," supposedly, to “expand” any sort of text, set off scripts (on macOS,) and paste fill in-able templates. These functions are divided into “[snippets](https://textexpander.com/learn/getting-started)” as part of “[snippet groups](https://textexpander.com/learn/getting-started/getting-started-for-admin).” In fact, I’ve created [**a dedicated snippet group to accompany this guide**](https://app.textexpander.com/public/12c50fb2360617d3cc66d757cf26383b). You can view all my TextExpander snippets in [this GitHub Repository](https://github.com/extratone/TextExpander).

![TextFuckSnippetGroup](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43663476/153726468-25b5a5a9-0381-4720-b1e7-c7fb2ef357d9.png)

It’s not much just yet, but if you “[subscribe](https://app.textexpander.com/public/12c50fb2360617d3cc66d757cf26383b)” to this snippet group from your own account, you’ll be treated to whatever I come up with in the future, delivered to your devices in real time. If you find yourself trying it out, you may as well check out my main Snippet Group, [Extratext](https://app.textexpander.com/public/14093096578d4f40eeea15649f5cefbb), which is documented [here](https://davidblue.wtf/extratext).

### Text Case

Christopher R Hannah’s Text Case is by far the most modern of all the dedicated text manipulation applications I have to share with you. Available (separately) on both [macOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/terminology-dictionary/id687798859) and [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/text-case/id1407730596), it’s a “flow”-based, Siri Shortcuts-resembling text formatting app with some very powerful functions. I know that’s basically word-for-word what anyone else’s had to say about it since its debut, four years ago... I apologize for the redundancy, but the way it works is extremely hard to describe in a way that makes any sense, especially just with a few video clips and/or static images.[^4] 

![MLADraft Shortcut](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43663476/154823905-90618f3b-45f4-42d0-940f-c8b04d395410.png)

Without being able to share my own “flows” (unfortunately,) all I can share with you is [this Siri Shortcut](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/6fd60faf566142b3b7d1fb0a0631fa1b) which is called from [this Drafts action](https://actions.getdrafts.com/a/1wQ) to reformat selected text (or the entire contents of the current draft) into proper MLA Title format before amending the results to a specific draft. I also created and published a shortcut called “[Speak Word Count](https://routinehub.co/shortcut/11094)” which uses Text Case’s Word Count “format” and [Siri Speech Synthesis](https://bilge.world/siri-tts) to speak aloud the word count of either the current selection (from the share sheet) or the contents currently in the system clipboard.

![Fuck Shortcut](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43663476/154841943-3ba7b019-c146-4765-90b1-2f52e34f3911.png)

I’ve also created [**Fuck**](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/edcc737ed7304a17bb3b4d8897aae29c) - a Siri Shortcut with three of my favorite Text Case formattings so far in succession: “Mocking Spongebob” (ick,) “Upside Down,” and “Clap Case.” It acts upon - and replaces - any text you’ve copied to the clipboard. Here’s an example:

```
ᴉ┴ 👏 ∀ɔʇs 👏 nԀou 👏  👏  👏 ∀up 👏 ɹƎd˥ɐɔǝs 👏  👏  👏 ∀u⅄ 👏 ┴Ǝx┴ 👏 ⅄On’Λǝ 👏 ɔoԀIǝp 👏 ┴o 👏 ʇɥǝ 👏 ɔlᴉdqo∀ɹp
```

## Siri Shortcuts

![TextFuckShortcuts](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43663476/153750918-ca0c5eb6-0d91-4d7f-b70b-550f0f44c528.png)

Another method of general Text Fuckery on iOS is achieved through its relatively “new”[^2] personal automation system, Siri Shortcuts. In fact, Apple includes what I would define as a genuine Text Fucker™ of a shortcut in its default shortcuts gallery, called “[All the Single Ladies ASCII](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/51392bf23f104b93baf72000955ed334)” which can be used to create rather adorable text snippets like this:
```txt
(•_•)
<)   )╯DAVID BLUE
 /    \ 

  (•_•)
 \(   (> WROTE
  /    \

 (•_•)
<)   )╯THIS.
 /    \
```
Through a Reddit thread I've never been able to find again, I discovered a method of randomizing strings of text that led to the creation of the Shortcuts you see below, all with native actions (aside from the outputs of those with specific services.) If you're willing to splurge on the whole 3.3mb, free (for macOS, iPadOS, and iOS) [**Actions app**](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/actions/id1586435171), you can accomplish the same task, but much more quickly and with less resource consumption. I think you can spare the space.[^3]

Perhaps the best place to start would be with the most documented (and perhaps most unique) Text Fucking Siri Shortcut I have to offer you. “[The Fastest Route to Twitter Jail](https://bilge.world/twitter-jail)” in fact details the workings of [**my Twitter Jail shortcut**](https://routinehub.co/shortcut/11086/), which uses [Tweetbot](http://bilge.world/tweetbot-6-ios-review)’s shortcuts actions to send 310 Tweets of random text in less than four minutes to an account of your specification.

If you’re new to Shorcuts entirely, what you see above will result in a string of random text copied to your clipboard, so that you can paste it whereever you might “need” to. Notably, I’ve been extremely lazy with the strings, despite having [the absolute best app for creating them](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/unichar-unicode-keyboard/id880811847) on my iPhone. I’d suggest you download it and play around yourself. As I said in [my review](http://bilge.world/unichar-for-ios-app-review), UniChar is a beautiful celebration of the diversity of Unicode. If what I’m talking about isn’t straightforward-sounding to you, [let me know](https://davidblue.wtf/db.vcf)! I absolutely *will* sit down and build something just for you.

### Text-Fucking Siri Shortcuts with Actions

These three shortcuts require [the Actions app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/actions/id1586435171), but the single action used across all of them - called `Random Text` - is one that works across all platforms.
