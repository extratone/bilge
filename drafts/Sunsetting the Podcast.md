# Sunsetting the Podcast
## Paid iTunes podcast subscriptions really do mark the end of an old, quaint medium called Pod Casts, but that‚Äôs okay.
_Audio is having a moment_, says the cacophony about heavy wood transistor radios humming in the private spaces of a populace under a plague‚Äôs siege. In the end, it could only have been the scent of such beautiful desperation to finally lure the money in, followed single-file by the American story, as always. The Undisputed OG of Broadcast Media rises like a Tucson from the embers of ad tech‚Äôs Great Crusades not to seek revenge, but to comfort the only known complex verbal species amid their Biggest Babel Breakdown yet. All it requires, truthfully, is a decent _approximation_ of a real two+-sided conversation. Well‚Ä¶ An _infinite list_ of such approximations, anyway, to leave playing in the background. To just hear two people taking turns speaking and then listening.

Honestly, I had absolutely zero intention of contributing any more to this _Digital Audio Renaissance_ conversation. Though I have been stipulating about _The Fateful Day_ when Apple might finally give in to its perception of competition and implement any sort of paid/premium content differentiation function in its directory of RSS feeds as the certain beginning of The End of the medium we recognize as ‚ÄúPodcasting,‚Äù I still didn‚Äôt consider the recent news of this day‚Äôs scheduled manifestation worthy of another meta-media post. Nay, it wasn‚Äôt until I overheard a _Windows Weekly_ host describe podcasting as a ‚Äúnew medium‚Äù with apparent sincerity at some point within its [**seven hundred twenty-first** episode](https://twit.tv/shows/windows-weekly/episodes/721) that I truly lost my mind.

My third, fourth and fifth eyes all opened wide, and I realized **he and I were definitely _not_ attributing the same thing to that term, anymore**. You probably shouldn‚Äôt already be aware that it‚Äôs long been produced by This Week in Tech (stylized popularly as _TWiT_) - which happens to be _the_ oldest podcast-first, for profit media group I can remember - surviving or not. The live, compressed, fucky frame rate image of Leo Laporte sitting alone in a studio-lit room wearing the crown of studio headphones with a mic pointed vaguely at his face is darn near old enough to be considered a _childhood memory_ of mine.

From my perspective, the more obscure of the social audio projects which currently exist appear to be attempting (consciously or not) to iterate on the age-old concept of Internet Radio. 



In *this* Post, I hope to aggregate the remaining sentiments/insights I've been tossing around regarding the whole of it, beginning - oddly enough - with a quite dramatic comment on RSS, of all things:

## "Podcast" is in desperate need of terminology parsing

Essentially, I meant to proceed from there to argue simply that **it's time for a new term to encapsulate this medium**. As someone who has listened to podcasts since pre-pubescence, I've had plenty of adjacent thoughts for years. When [*S-Town*](https://stownpodcast.org/) debuted in the spring of 2017, for instance, I couldn't help but observe it in the same application beside my own work - supposedly within the same medium - and remark with awe on the diversity of content carried by Real Simple Syndication. This was also amidst the peak of my disenchantment with ad tech, when I was vocally against the whole idea, yet this stance did not include podcasts distributed via RSS. I'm assuming my reasoning had mostly to do with the obvious - that pure RSS is completely inept when it comes to gathering listener data[^2] - but simple oversight shouldn't be ruled out. Up until the point Apple Podcasts (the titan of distribution for Podcasts, then and now) [added paid subscription options](https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/22/22396042/apple-podcast-subscriptions-launch-price), last month, the diversity of content distributed by RSS was nothing more than spectacular. Now, I believe a divide has been crossed, making it *problematic*.
