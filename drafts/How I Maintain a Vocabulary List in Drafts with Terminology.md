As I wrote in [my app store review of Terminology](https://tilde.town/~extratone/appreviews/terminology) (which is not shown publicly, I’ve since learned,) I prefer it over popular dictionary apps like [LookUp](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/lookup-english-dictionary/id872564448) (which I also have and use regularly) because it allows me to *add new terms* that don’t show up in search results. Somehow, the idea that one might store words that don’t necessarily appear in any dictionary seems a foreign one to the creators of LookUp, which I’ve since found out to be the cause of [its Siri Shortcuts actions failing on me](https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/1477323450549219328).

[Terminology](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/terminology-dictionary/id687798859) *does* support adding “custom” terms, if unintentionally, through its “notes” function.
