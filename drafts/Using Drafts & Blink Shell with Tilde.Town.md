As you may or may not be aware, I’ve exclusively interacted with the Tildeverse on [my iPhone 12 Pro Max](https://github.com/extratone/jorts) using a beautiful app called Blink Shell, which offers a free “[Community Edition](https://testflight.apple.com/v1/app/1156707581)” in the form of that Testflight link. I’ve just become a subscriber of something called “Blink+” for $19.99 a year... [perhaps in haste](https://reddit.com/r/BlinkShell/comments/sq3zur/_/hxlvgq4/?context=1). I did so within the application entitled “[Blink Shell & Code](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/blink-shell-code/id1594898306)” on the App Store.

## Drafts

I’ve also configured [an action](https://actions.getdrafts.com/a/1wO) for AgileTortoise’s [Drafts](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/drafts/id1435957248) (my preferred writing space for most of my adult life) which copies the contents of my current draft as HTML via [my template](https://tilde.town/~extratone/template/1.2.txt). 

I also added [a duplicate](https://tilde.town/~extratone/nano) of [the full online GNU-nano manual](https://nano-editor.org/dist/latest/nano.html) to my Tilde site for both our reference.
