There's diagram first half hour how much exploitation second half hour for a reason and Zepplin freeze on a worldwide rooms for Tatian hasn't been used yet we need to ostentatious for Tatian and zeppelins boy Tatian we can just mail them both and get these people in the movie theater two things three things The Amish What they have to do with each other, do you have to come you're not find out what I articulated an actual argue there is a theme to children like 130 and I can tell you right now I cannot see a theme in for a Zepplin like I can probably figure it out I'm not pretentious but right as of this moment I cannot write for a Zepplin I've got the plot for it so there's a there's a the Hindenburg nine it's deporting and there's a bunch of normal people on it and then there's some Furrys and it's spread this disease as the airship is trying to dock and it's like every since I have ever thought about like fucking a dog No it's not fucking a dog it's like how do you wanna like getting a dog suit and fuck what if you were a dog and then we fuck yeah I was in thinking like maybe I'm like secretly a rabbit and I wanna shit in his diaper in and jerk off and then I was like oh yeah David Davis is just at the helm like 100 iron cross jingling on his jacket and I just zoomed into his face and he's like sweating just trying to land it so now just fine trying to land the plane and he's like above like the whole thing is like above Nebraska and they're all trying to shoot him down to never be the same The end of the movie is the Zepplin gets shot down in like three diaper shit just rains all over a fucking like Tulsa I just the Oklahoma is off the map forever but we're gonna call it Tulsa Nebraska Tulsa Nebraska now just let his business alternate universe or 1989 was sold by Taylor Swift everything turned out different I just like the idea of there's so many German metals that I am like I'm just wearing German metals and I'm sweating just holding myself up at the helm of the Zepplin nine like people are slowly dying like for you know as the crew are keeping art like fighting off a furry army On the airship where Also to avoid being violently slaughtered by the fact is I think just like having to avoid getting in like a free diaper soon as like a month German off like World War I era German officer uniforms and people are running away from diapers in furry suits in an airship like zooms in on David's face on the side of his cheek just got splattered with blood and his copilot just has like a Lugar in his mouth oh my God see we can do use a pleasure serving bowl I don't I don't think we could do this actually because like we have to know some README yeah we need to Zepplin first I thought we suggested this like 20 episodes ago I want to start a Kickstarter to build the Zepplin to like someone working and they're just like are you gonna make any safety altercation or no I want to make a pizza delivery service with a Zepplin cold zuppa Roni pizza zapper Roni pizza I mean like OK let's just paint this picture because that is entertaining so no one here in this podcast no one listening has ever witnessed an airship talking but here's here's what it's like so there are tons of engines on an air ShopRite and so when we went flying over even though it's not moving very fast you just hear like a buzzing sound like this And I like the tongue is like a beehive this imagine like we ordered pizza and then you just see this like like 3/4 of a mile long fucking airship coming toward you Giant or iron cross simulator yes pieces here and then like you know docking a Zepplin obviously is not not easy considering what happened but yeah I mean I think this is a good idea we really found a niche that is not being catered too so maybe airborne pizza just throw them out and shoots and gliders just just the pizza box well and they had scout planes they could launch off of their ships in World War I the Germans dead No it was incredibly dangerous and they actually could land till it was a hook that could catch them yeah now they were they they had some I mean it makes sense but I know you know from that from what I'm saying I was not safe in World War I this one British pilot want to reload is gone near the guns was above the wings in grabbed it his knee like hit one of the puddles and his plane to the loop D loop while he was holding onto just the gun and he did a pull up to get himself back in that's amazing I mean we were one like lower one aviation now that you're back Was fucking Jackie is hell is this one way I can describe World War I out like every Aircon that is Jenkee as fuck so let's move on to him what if we put slim thug on the step one I don't know I'm taking off down the runway broad day Sunday Peters looking at me Play in the rain wanna swing in on the one-way I see you And a beautiful one day
