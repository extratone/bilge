# Transcript: "[Steve Jobs Interview - 2/18/1981](https://youtu.be/DbfejwP1d3c)"



we have to

presume any time we do a story that that

most of the audience hasn't that any

time you introduce

any subject or any topic or any any big

word really

that you have to familiarize the

audience you were talking about 60

minutes uh they

they do the same thing harry reisner did

a piece on

some guy who was a card counter playing

blackjack a couple of weeks ago

and they spent about three minutes in

the context of the story

establishing how to play blackjack right

just uh the fact that you have to uh

sure go for 20 yeah for 21. so yeah

that's

we make this an interesting thing about

television is it always she

seems to shoot for the lowest common

denominator

uh stephen to get a two-shot that we

need it sounds a little peculiar but

you can't and it'll be painless and over

quickly

great thank you i could embrace him if

you wish no

the reason they take these two shots is

because they they do all this market

research on

on television and they you know they go

into a shopping center and grab

50 viewers and put them in a trailer and

show them tapes

and to try to find out what they like

and what they don't what bothers them

and what doesn't one of the things that

they found

bothered viewers was in the typical

nightly just like to see

um the environment that you're talking

and so hence the

the wide shot yes

is it over yeah

steve when you began to develop this

five years ago what sort of need did you

see

that existed then that you felt these

computers was going to

fill well basically

the quest are we actually doing this now

oh great the question is

is really what is a personal computer

and why is it different than all the

other computers that have existed

throughout history

probably the best way to explain that is

through an analogy when you look at the

invention of the first electric motor in

the late 1800s it was only possible to

build a very large one

and it was very very expensive and

therefore it could only be cost

justified for the most expensive

or large applications and the electric

motor really took its next step in

proliferation when somebody hooked a

long shaft to it and ran it down the

center of a factory through series of

belts and pulleys brought that power

down

to maybe 15 or 20 individual

workstations thereby cost justifying

sharing that horsepower among some

medium-sized applications

but the electric motor really achieved a

true proliferation in the society with

the invention of the fractional

horsepower electric motor

and at that point the horsepower could

be brought directly to where it was

needed

on a personal scale cost justified for a

small number of things

and we see the same thing the same

evolution if we examine the history of

computing the first computer

eniac in 1946 was designed primarily for

weather and ballistic calculations very

large tasks

and the next revolution in computing was

in the 1960s with the invention of

what's called time

sharing in essence sharing one of these

very large computers with maybe 40 or 50

terminals scattered through a company

and thereby cost justifying it for

medium-sized applications

what we think the personal computer

industry is about is the invention of

the fractional horsepower computer

something that can be cost justified on

the personal level something that weighs

12 pounds that you can throw out the

window if you don't like

and it's really changing the way that

people interact with computers there's a

one-on-one relationship that develops

between one person and one computer

now when you use the term a personal

computer you're avoiding the term

a home computer for a deliberate reason

right right

we view we segment our market uh

really into four major segments uh

education

professional small business home

consumer

and scientific industrial now the home

market

hasn't really taken off it's the

probably the smallest of those four i've

listed

we view the home now not as a market

really but as a location

in which personal computers are used for

a variety of functions

sometimes in other words you can use a

personal computer to do some portfolio

management on some stocks

you can use a personal computer to do

some educational uh

can i answer that question okay yeah you

can just pick it up

oh okay great sam you were

when you grew up you're saying are we

still waiting for uh yeah

question and we'll pick it up right

okay john

and when you use the term a personal

computer you're deliberately avoiding

the the use of the term

home computer aren't you right we um

we view the home not really as a market

yet we view it more as a location

we sell a lot of personal computers that

are used for financial analysis for

education in schools

for running laboratory experiments in

you know universities and in

in scientific applications and a lot of

these personal computers are used

in the home as a location some of the

time

but there's not enough specific

applications to cost justify

spending a thousand to three thousand

dollars for a personal computer to be

used in the home

yet so we don't think the home is quite

yet ready uh

either culturally or economically what

type of person would

need a personal computer today of the

type you offer

well it gets back to the question of

what is a personal computer again

uh again another analogy

there was an article in scientific

american in the early 70s which compared

the efficiency of locomotion for various

species of things on the planet in other

words they measured how much energy it

took for a bird to get from point a to

point b

compared with the energy it took a fish

to get the same distance and a goat and

a person and all sorts of other things

and they ranked them and turns out the

condor won

condor was the most efficient and mann

came in with a rather unimpressive

showing about a third of the way down

the list

somewhat disappointing but someone there

had the insight to test the efficiency

of man riding a bicycle

and man riding a bicycle was twice as

good as the condor all the way off the

end of the list

and what it really illustrated was man's

ability as a tool maker

to fashion a tool that can amplify an

inherent ability that he has

and that's exactly what we think we're

doing we think we're basically

fashioning a 21st century bicycle here

which can amplify an inherent

intellectual ability that man has

and really take care of a lot of

drudgery to free people to do much more

creative work

does this mean do you think that

personal computers

in the 21st century will be as much a

part of a home as say

a refrigerator uh we can always

we can look at what's happening right

now as an example in the state of

minnesota which is probably the leading

state in the country

over 97 percent of the kids that

graduate from high school have hands-on

experience with an apple before they

graduate

these kids are growing up learning how

to use this new tool

in many many phases of their life

they're hitting college the same thing's

happening

and so very rapidly uh the process of

the integration of personal computers

into the society will be accomplished

let me illustrate two other processes

which have happened in our lifetime very

similar to this

you probably haven't used a piece of

carbon paper or seen a mimeograph

machine in a while

and yet the first xerox machine was

introduced

less than 20 years ago it'll be 20 years

ago next month

and in 20 years it's radically altered

the way that we work

another process the hp 35 first

scientific handheld calculator was

introduced by hewlett packard in 1972

but we all know where that's gone in

just nine years but another interesting

sidelight is in 1978 the largest

manufacturer of slide rules in the world

stopped making them entirely because the

market had gone away

six years so we see that it is possible

in our lifetimes for a process

like this to radically influence the way

that we work and even start to look at

life

when you say start to look at life how

where where is the impact going to be

felt most in the intellectual process

in the day-to-day living process that is

running the household

in terms of the way you spend your

leisure time is there any way to

to pinpoint one of those areas as being

the most likely to

what we have seen in almost all

applications of personal computers that

have happened to date the industry is

only five years old but we've seen we've

shipped you know in excess of 150 000

personal computers ourselves

we've seen a dramatic increase

in the creativity of people in dealing

with a problem

rather than doing the drudgery rather

than using traditional tools

people are freed to think about the

conceptual issues involved and the

creative issues involved

and use the computer actually to to plow

through the drudgery this is an

education

where students can actually learn at

their own pace where they can interact

with a computer rather than just having

a one-way communication through the

medium of television

or books that can actually interact with

the medium

we're seeing this in the professional

sphere where we no longer

have as an example at apple we no longer

have secretaries at apple

we have what we call area administrators

they're using the computers for all

their word processing

they do all departmental budgeting on it

we do our entire forecasting using our

own tools

and we're actually changing job

descriptions based on allowing people to

do more creative work rather than more

more work work you mentioned that the uh

that the the calculators

eliminated in at least one case indeed

for slide rules

that your secretarial job descriptions

are changing

yes are there any other major areas that

personal computers

are going to change in that direction

that most people would be familiar with

or make obsolete well i don't think

personal computers are making anything

obsolete in the sense of what people do

i think they're enriching what people do

again there is a a common conception

that people have of computers which is

more along the lines of 1984

very large very centralized computers

and i know the privacy issue is very

very

hot in the media these days but what

we're finding is that when people

actually see what a personal computer is

they see something that looks

you know approximately they can hold it

in their hands it weighs 12 pounds again

they can throw it out the window if they

don't like it

and it is very decentralized it's very

democratic

and it's something that completely is uh

almost the opposite of the 1984

conception we have

and what we're finding is it is it is

enriching people's lives

it is freeing people to do things like

we think people do best

is there any basis for comparing you to

say mattel

and atari or is that like comparing

apples and oranges

oranges we describe our business as

really making tools and not toys

and uh we're really interested in

providing that bicycle type of tool to

the marketplace

i think uh some other people are more

interested in providing an entertainment

value

which is which is valuable of course too

but that's not our business

is there a difference in your technology

as well

um there's something happening actually

in the whole personal computer industry

with all the serious competitors

the again this process of integrating

personal computers into the society is

going to take maybe 10 years to

conclude and we of course want to

continue to sell more and more and more

computers

the key to that will be to make the

computers easier and easier and easier

to use

and the way that that's going to happen

is we're going to be spending more and

more of the computer power in the box

to adapt the computer more to the way

people are familiar with doing things

so that people have to adapt less to the

way computers do things

and therefore it will require a more

sophisticated computer

that's the paradox in our industry right

now to make a computer simpler to use

requires a more sophisticated computer

that's part of the reason the home

market doesn't exist yet because if you

think about it

the home user needs the easiest to use

computer therefore the most

sophisticated

therefore one of the most expensive so

we expect prices not to come tumbling

down in the next few years but actually

to

stay to main you'll get more computer

power for the same dollar you might even

see prices increase a little

but the computers are going to get

dramatically easier to use

so you and your partner grew up in this

valley silicon valley what kind of uh

culture uh existed here that that's led

to all of the the building that's

gone on all the companies that have been

created this

uh santa clara valley which we all refer

to affectionately silicon valley

is probably one of the finest examples

of of what i call sort of an

entrepreneurial risk culture

anywhere in the world and both my

partner steve wozniak and i both grew up

here

and really some of the people that

founded companies around the area

hewlett and

bill hewlett and dave packard and others

were really our role models our heroes

and we like to think that we're carrying

on that tradition

what is there left for you to do now

that you're 25 uh your company's gone

public

yeah it's worth hundreds of millions of

dollars

well we don't really feel we've

accomplished what we set out to do yet

we've set out to really help lead this

process of

getting personal computers into the

society and i think uh

asked me in five years

great thank you very much okay all right

yeah the only thought i had

even though you and the video game

manufacturers really exist in two

different worlds

yes is the fact that children and people

in general are becoming so familiar with

the use of these

video games and the simple computers

that go along with them

are going to make people more

aware of personal computers in the

future do you think and better able to

deal with them

sure matter of fact it's not even only

occurring in the video game area it's

occurring as an example with an

automated bank teller

people are interacting more and more

with intelligent devices whether it be

an intelligent game or an intelligent

bank teller or

whatever and we you're already seeing it

in society now

people are becoming more and more

familiar with interacting with

intelligent

electronic devices and that's changing

things culturally

it's a step along the way

thank you okay thank you very much

did you get what you want is that yeah

that was good i think i think it

doesn't tie you to

uh to them and yet

professionally but i think it does to

the idea that

that los angeles just because there's so

much work on that coast and then the

other

six five or six months you know in

between

what uh do you need steve talking do you

want me to re

ask her okay you don't even need to

re-answer what they'll do is take this

and splice it in

right you know how it works so i don't

need to talk no great just

uh not or something so when they make

the edit it'll look as if you're

making some physical emotions but yeah

all right i'm going to begin with the

reasons okay

when you began to begin when you began

to develop this business five years ago

what sort of need for personal computers

did you improve

steve when you began to develop the

business about five years ago

what needs for personal computers did

you observe that

when you use the word personal computer

you intentionally

avoid the word home computers

now when you use the term personal

computer you deliberately avoided the

use of the term

home computer right

what type of person would have a

personal

computer today what type of individual

would have a person

what type of individual would buy a

personal computer today

that's right we always get a lot of good

answers

this was just a statement does this mean

that personal computers

in the 21st century would be as ordinary

as say a refrigerator

okay does this mean that uh

personal computers in the 21st century

would be as ordinary

a part of a household as say a

refrigerator a vacuum cleaner

i can't crack this guy up

oh yes you can

i used to be the easiest guy uh uh

that's another story i'm not going to

tell it

where they'll have it on tape and

somebody will pull it out of the blue

for real

i'm not going to like it yeah sure

okay next question okay where is the

impact of

personal computers going to be felt the

most okay

where's the impact of personal computers

going to be felt most in the future uh

and then there was a lengthy question

that had to do with calculators

uh and secretarial jobs and any other

changes he might

foresee in the future okay

if calculators are making slide rules

obsolete

and your computer is allowing you to

redefine your secretarial jobs into

other categories more creative

categories

what other types of things are going to

change as a result of personal computers

or be made obsolete

that do it even though you and the video

manufacturers

of apple and the video game

manufacturers exist in different worlds

is there some awareness of computing

even though apple and the video game

manufacturers really exist in in two

different worlds

are these video games in a sense getting

people more

accustomed to the idea of personal

computers

okay that's the end great

now i will listen to steve right and you

can say

anything this is this is the fun farm

yeah where do you do do you vacation in

this area or do you go uh

yeah yeah no uh i don't i haven't taken

a vacation in a long time

that's how i measure whether i'm

successful is whether i could take off

for three months

so far i'm not successful yeah well

someday

oh yeah how do you how do you build an

executive core

around a company like this obviously you

and your partner had to take an awful

lot of responsibility for

well one of the things that we always

did was we tried to hire somebody who

was better than us in a particular thing

that's still my greatest joy around here

is when we hire somebody that's better

than i'll ever be at one particular

thing

so you try to hire just really

outstanding people that are much too

they're actually much too senior for the

current jobs that you have

but you know you're planning to grow so

fast that in six months the job's just

right for them and in a year they're

scrambling to keep up with it

so we've grown it you know

several hundred percent a year and uh

it's a

very very different type of environment

than most people are used to we've got a

whole

generation of managers here they're

trained to grow at 400

a year and they'd be bored stiff growing

at 30 percent a year
