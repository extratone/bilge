After the past few months (and years, tbh) of news, [that Summer I spent with virtually zero internet access](https://bilge.world/bad-connection-insights) is starting to look better and better.

Rather than simply letting tabs fill up, you’re encouraged to create “tasks” that let you divide different use cases up.

(I can also hide the usual junk that sits in the pinned tabs in its own task.)

- [ ] Reading view is a little slow.

- [ ] "Return to your previous task" is a lot more useful than "open where you left off."

- [ ] Browsing entirely centered around the search bar.

- [ ] It would be nice to be able to preview hyperlinks in the left-bottom corner just by hovering on them instead of having to right-click.

- [ ] Customizable hotkeys are brilliant.

- [ ] You cannot move tabs around, which supports Min's minimal tab argument.
