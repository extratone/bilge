# My Darling, Typora

## At long last, I have found the perfect writing software.

I'm not exactly sure what set off my obsession with word processing software in 2018, though I suspect it was my discovery of the WinWorldPC library.

Typora is an infinitely-customizable markdown editor spanning all platforms that's managed to become my primary word processor (and I'm someone who demands *a lot* from word processors.) It's immensely powerful in all the important ways - my use over the past two years has stress tested it with both enormous (100,000+ words) and extremely complicated (100+ images and embeds) documents. It's able to export even these chunkos to any format you can imagine instantaneously and never crashes. I used to recommend it as an alternative to Bear, but honestly, I think it's better.
