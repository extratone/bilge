# Twelve Billion

I must hold on to
*glad to be home*

Returning.
now,
let go of the wood


to the thunderclouds
we're under,
always apart 

to omission. 

to new meanings
to the feeling I've only been able to find
on one short strip
just East of Kansas City
that I am small in a
dirty daunting


to coverage of
the Be Beat 


to frontiers of periphery
and the Knowns we never see
the wicker bowler atop the landscaper
who's trimmed every week,
the yard across the street
which I've canvased in every imaginable state
which's
since Mrs. Tanzay's first grade,
Remained.
 

to Inherently Exhaustible Knowledge
