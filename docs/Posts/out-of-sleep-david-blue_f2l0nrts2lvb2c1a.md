# Out

![KCOU at Dawn](https://i.snap.as/Q0aNuGB.jpeg)

listen now,
wrinkling husk of the wheat:

now or then,
it did not matter,
but forgone,
it comes back around again.

come down out of there,
now. tend to that mess before supper - no chance to get out of the house, again.

the disarray!
standing, splayed -
overgrown, lonely,
half-awake.

blasted, or washing away.
words aplenty, nothing to say.

through his night where even demons
find the story mundane,
starving for knowing before
dew and the shakes
