# Ablaze, the Fraternal Fallow

![Oak Cliff Sky ](https://i.snap.as/wXG1ZnE.jpeg)
and in those open spaces,
you would fly your flag of adoration, frustration, miscommunication, and mutilation

slicing proud,
there -
lashed to the stern of the vessel *Hateful*;

her keel lain by callouses of home -
hands & feet stiff
(long ago,
they hauled barley, by bushel
down a gravel road)

but an instant of that rarified quiet stays the haze's obfuscation,
faltered:
our sisters lie lynched on dire alters

our homesteads,
crypts; shrines to delirium
the chords of our songs left unresolved
in imposters' inrequiem

plastic for stone;
fiberglass for coal
stale rot for flesh,
cut with nothing
to our bones

mirages in the mirror,
darkly:
devil's imps roost on red Remingtons,
limp

plugged,
our ears in mute

terror's gluttony,
stripped down furrows of
falsity's fatherly fugue
**truth: our souls seethe in the dark**
we are drowning in our own deceptions

in excess,
we are barren
we parade nothing but the lies
which proceed the whole of Earthly pain

breathless,
we are foolish monstrosities -
the incongruent Lords of amplified insanity

resolute,
we are the hearthen hole into which all eventually fall,
famished for youth

manic,
we are the monopolized manufacturers of mantra;
an ambient, discordant dirge

patriotic,
we produce only pervading paternal plague

nostalgic,
we are the fundamental erosion of human wellness

abrasive,
we are needlessly suffering -
the listless harlequin of a nation

~**the world is growing weary of our emergency**~
and the humongous expenditure of its petty insincerities
