# Reading

![Compaq Portable 386](https://i.snap.as/niq0aqH.png)

I read a lot on the web about technology, cars, music and media. If you'd like to keep up with me, join my/*Extratone*'s [**reading list channel**](http://bit.ly/extraread) on Discord, which has also served as a place for others to share their favorite links as well. Using the [Discord chat exporter](https://github.com/Tyrrrz/DiscordChatExporter), I've created an **[HTML file](http://bit.ly/extraread42020)** of the channel's **entire history** as of April 6th, 2020.

I've posted some of my all-time favorites from the past few years in [this Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/1247152287379861504).

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">here is the entire history of the Extratone reading list as of today in HTML format. literally years of good reads! <a href="https://t.co/8wFoiDE7SU">https://t.co/8wFoiDE7SU</a></p>&mdash; David Blue (@NeoYokel) <a href="https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/1247152287379861504?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 6, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Another great tool I recently discovered is [**Reading**](https://www.reading.am/DavidBlue), which appears to be everything I've ever wanted (but never found from services like Pocket) in a public reading list. You can even subscribe to [my profile's RSS feed](https://www.reading.am/DavidBlue/list.rss)!

Dave Pell's [*Nextdraft* newsletter](https://nextdraft.com/) is the only hard news mailer I would ever recommend. If you can stand his puns, you need to subscribe.

Casey Newton is quite simply the best reporter on the social media beat. His daily output is absolutely astounding.

### [The Media Today](https://www.cjr.org/email)

The [*Columbia Journalism Review*](https://www.cjr.org)'s daily in-depth email is perhaps the most comprehensive aggregate of media news available.
