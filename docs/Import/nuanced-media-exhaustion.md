Have you ever wondered what it would be like to live two years spending all - and I literally mean _all_ - of your free time screwing around on the web? Well, I guess I should really do an AMA on the _Read It_ website because that's me! I realized last night how ridiculous it was to allow this blog to be indexed by search engines, so I added a motherfuckin bypass request to the goddamned robots.txt! That makes you super "sus" for reading this, but I guess you get this _exclusive_, _behind-the-scenes_ pre-release of the front cover on Extratone Magazine's first issue. Though I am now a Certified Gimp Poweruser and I spent a long time on this, it's pretty fuckin bad. I do think we should do our best to compile a print release of all the best stuff from the past two years some time in the near future, and I'm now pretty sure that I should get somebody else to do the cover...

I've decided that _Vice_'s _Motherboard_ and Waypoint are tied for _Extratone_'s #1 competitor and they're uhhh... definitely winning - Laugh, Out Loud - yet I don't envy them at all, if I'm completely honest: video games are cool and longform game reviews are incredible, but they've never had an audience, really, so the two justify their respective existences as _Vice_ properties by their quaint, internet culture-inspired overuse of the terms "boys" and "sons." Regardless, my bum-fucking led to [an interview](http://podbay.fm/show/1214112139/e/1500471213) that definitely fucking belongs on _Drycast_ with Angela Nagle - author of [_Kill All Normies_](http://www.zero-books.net/books/kill-all-normies).

Yeah... **Holy shit**. What a supremely relevant conversation to just stumble upon, fuckin' around on Apple Podcasts (no lie.) I am _actually_ obligated to read and review this book - it's like a textbook for the niche online culture we had to watch turn a lot of our proxy communities culture2WWDC 1999o shit in high school. The last time I heard/used the term "normie," it in no way belonged to Read It or 4 Channel nazis... just anime Twitter NEETs. (Yes, I know they overlap, but jeez.)

I can reliably vouch for pink hair as a 100% accurate marker for a cultural marxist. Anyway, I'd now like to welcome you to the 1999 World Wide Developer's Conference. Look at those typefaces! Why can't we go back to that?
