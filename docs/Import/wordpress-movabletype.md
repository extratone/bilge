Kara Swisher interviewed Matt Mullenweg on _Recode Decode_! It's extremely sad how excited I was to see this in my podcast feed (and that I'm already writing about it before the post has actually gone up on _Recode_, itself.)

They discussed MovableType briefly, which was revived in 2013 and [now has a 50% Japanese language usership](https://whatcms.org/c/Movable-Type), and I'd really like to know how that happened.

Also, I had no idea his and WordPress' company, Automattic owned _Longreads_ and [_Atavist_](https://magazine.atavist.com). Hilariously, I also found out [his old blog themes](https://ma.tt/themes/) are now available in the WordPress theme directory. Unfortunately, I had to wait a whole darned week for a "[lightly-edited transcript](https://www.recode.net/2018/8/2/17641412/matt-mullenweg-wordpress-media-privacy-advertising-data-reckoning-kara-swisher-decode-podcast)" \[[local backup](http://extratone.com/library/mattmulleweg-recode.pdf)\] of this episode, but frankly, I'm just glad they decided it was worth transcribing at all, considering WordPress' out-of-the-excitable-for-dabblers status. I mean... it was probably a bit cruel to place Mullenweg's episode in direct followup to [Kara Swisher's interview with Mark Zuckerberg](https://www.recode.net/2018/7/18/17575156/mark-zuckerberg-interview-facebook-recode-kara-swisher) the previous week, which - for obvious and entirely-justified reasons - will surely be the most-listened-to _Recode Decode_ episode by far in its recent history, at least. 

> "I've been doing WordPress for 15 years and I'd like to do it the rest of my life."

_Yiokes!_ Ya know? You're damned right, "oof."

> "I think every tech company should have an editorial team."

Out of _signficant_ and nearly-unbearably heavy bias, I must agree wholeheartedly with this statement - and Mullenweg's requisite elaboration - and I must leave you with the expression of one final wish: that Zuckerberg had been interviewed post-Matt, instead, and Kara Swisher would've brought this up with him.
